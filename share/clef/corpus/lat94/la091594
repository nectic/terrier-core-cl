 BEACH DAY: Organizers are hoping that 1,500 people will volunteer Saturday to 
clean Ventura County beaches and inland waterways. But so far, fewer than 200 
have signed up. . . . "Probably a lot of people are going to just show up," 
coordinator Richard Sweet said. "Most people make an event of it. They clean up 
the beach, have their barbecue and then enjoy the clean beach.". . . Last year, 
1,348 volunteers picked up 30,000 pounds of trash. 
</P>
<P>
 LAST CHANCE: Appeal now, or accept your 1994-95 property tax as is. That is 
the message from county Assessor Glenn Gray. About 4,600 home and business 
owners have requested lower taxable value. . . . "About three-quarters get 
reductions," Gray said. "We realize it's a down real estate market, and we 
can't get out and review all of them." . . . As today's deadline approached, 
the county Assessment Appeals Board was flooded with mail. "I can't tell you 
the stacks we have here," clerk Connie Taft said. 
</P>
<P>
 ACT ONE: When the curtain rises on the first theater performance at the Civic 
Arts Plaza on Friday, it will culminate a dream hatched 30 years ago when 
Thousand Oaks was just an infant. (Ventura County Life, Page 8) . . . Larry 
Janss was a driving force in getting the center built. His father, Edwin, laid 
out the city itself on his Conejo Ranch. "My father was originally one of the 
greatest cynics when it came to founding the city. I felt kind of the same way 
about the Civic Arts Plaza in its early stages." . . . Now Janss says of the 
center's future: "Financially, it will be a great challenge; spiritually, it 
will be uplifting and unifying." 
</P>
<P>
 NO GO: As American gunships churned toward Haiti, it was business as usual for 
the Seabees at Port Hueneme. "We're not even on standby," said base spokeswoman 
Doris Lance. . . . With an invasion, a naval construction battalion likely 
would land, but it would be from Gulfport, Miss.

 Where the bodies are buried: The annual Rosedale Cemetery Tour will feature 
some live entertainment this year -- actors who will portray famous and 
infamous Angelenos in period costumes at the grave sites.

 Long before Heidi, for instance, L.A. had Hattie. That was Hattie Wilson, one 
of the city's turn-of-the-century brothel keepers mentioned in the scholarly 
tome, "Tarnished Angels." 
</P>
<P>
 Hattie will rise to say a few words at the Sept. 24 event. Another speaker 
will be A. C. Harper, a former mayor who is also a permanent resident under the 
ground at 1831 W. Washington Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 It's appropriate that Harper should appear along with Hattie because he was 
known as a frequenter of brothels right up to the time that he was forced to 
resign as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper's explanation was that he was on fact-finding missions.

 Know your suburbs: The San Fernando Valley Historical Society's publication 
reports that the town of Taft, now part of Woodland Hills, "was named for

 We imagine this was one name change that didn't engender much opposition.

 Beer happens: The Miller Brewing Co., you may have heard, has filed a lawsuit 
to stop a San Gabriel Valley reclamation plan from forcing it to use water made 
out of effluent in its beer. If Miller's suit should fail, the Irwindale 
company will at least have a host of recycled slogans available, including: 
</P>
<P>
 * "This Crud's for You!" 
</P>
<P>
 * "It's Sewer Time!"

<P>
 * "From the Land of Sky-Brown Water!"

<P>
 * "Let It Be Sewer Brau!"

 This is the type of offbeat Southern California story that seems likely to 
receive national attention from Jay, Dave and other commentators. So we should 
add one more: "The Beer That Made Irwindale Infamous!" miscelLAny To our list 
of multicultural eateries, we must add Curry House, a Japanese restaurant in 
Weller Court adjacent to the New Otani hotel whose specialties include German 
spaghetti.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
$1.2 MILLION AWARDED FOR PARKLAND PROJECTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County supervisors on Tuesday allocated about $1.2 million in 
voter-approved funds for parkland acquisition and improvement to projects in 
the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys. 
</P>
<P>
 The money came from Proposition A, the 2-year-old property assessment measure 
that will generate $540 million countywide.Most of the money was earmarked 
under the measure, but the supervisors have discretion over how $37 million of 
it is spent. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 community organizations and cities competed for about $10 
million of the discretionary funds this year, leaving about $27 million to be 
awarded during the next three years. The supervisors awarded about 12% of the 
funds to cities and groups in the Valley region after reviewing recommendations 
from panels that included community members. In most cases, the awards will be 
matched or augmented by non-county contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 The allocations include: 
</P>
<P>
 * $40,000 for a public art mural and the installation of graffiti-resistant 
tile in the restroom at Las Palmas Park in the city of San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 * $46,895 for graffiti prevention and removal at Apollo Park, Jackie Robinson 
Park and Everett Martin Park in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 * $200,000 for the restoration and enhancement of Bull Creek in the Sepulveda 
Basin Recreation Area. 
</P>
<P>
 * $500,000 for the acquisition of five acres and construction of a bike trail 
along the Santa Clara River in the city of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 * $415,152 for the acquisition of land and construction of a 1.5-mile 
multipurpose trail off Barrell Springs Road in Palmdale.

AROUND THE VALLEY: YOM KIPPUR EVOKES MOURNFUL MEMORY OF A COURAGEOUS FATHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON D. MARKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This afternoon is about memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
 They wash over us in waves of anguish, and we grip our seatmates' hands to 
keep from being swept away. 
</P>
<P>
 We remember the dead this afternoon. And there is no sugarcoating. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Jewish faith, Yom Kippur is well known as a day for atonement. But in 
the coldness of a public place -- perhaps a synagogue, but more likely a vast 
hotel ballroom rented to accommodate the holiday overflow -- today is also a 
day for mourning. A day to warm ourselves by the light of our rabbis' prayers, 
a lonely day despite the crowd, a cease-fire in the 364-day war against 
remembrance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I am very close to my father on these afternoons, closer than I care to be the 
rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes I am in his Sherman Oaks hospital room a week before he died. It is 
after midnight, and the hallway outside is dark except for the ghostly blue 
flickering of light from the TV screen in his room. 
</P>
<P>
 A tennis game is on -- the replay of some match played in bright sunshine in a 
desert town -- and the heat of the scene mocks the coolness of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 My father loved tennis, and as I kneel at his side and hold his warm hand, I 
try to talk with him about the players. I try to tell him about my day at work, 
about my commute, about my wife, about the day's march of news from South 
America, an airline merger, the Dodgers game. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there is no response. Hasn't been all day, I'm told by his nurse. 
His eyes are open but he cannot speak. 
</P>
<P>
 I put my head on his heaving chest and weep. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I know that my father wouldn't be so sentimental. But I am not as strong as 
he. 
</P>
<P>
 His own father died when he was 13 during an Independence Day weekend in Great 
Falls, Mont. According to family lore, the following month Dad packed up his 
mom and three sisters in a long, black truck and drove them clear to Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know how my dad felt about those events. He seldom talked about his 
youth on the prairie. And he never talked about his father, an immigrant 
Russian fur trader and junk dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sure I would have asked him if I had had more time. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is no more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Only memories on Yom Kippur. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes on this day I find myself sitting next to him on a couch in his 
Tarzana home the day he returned from cancer treatment in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half before, we were shocked to learn that a sheet of cancer had 
shot undetected from his kidneys to his legs. A final burst of growth against 
his femoral artery would have killed him within days, we were told. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent a month at UCLA Medical Center recovering from surgery and was 
pronounced a lucky man -- a victor in the "fight" against cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 By winter he was skiing in the Canadian Rockies, a drug-delivery syringe 
plugged into his chest the only clue that he'd been sick. By summer he was, as 
usual, beating me at tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite his vigor, we knew something had gone wrong. He doubled over in pain 
after our matches. His legs barely lasted a set. When not gritting his teeth 
and swinging a racket, he couldn't walk far without a helping shoulder to lean 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 We were learning the fallacy of the word fight when it comes to cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 He soon ditched his doctors at UCLA in search of better treatment at the 
University of Texas Medical Center. An oncologist there planned to put my 
father on a promising new drug protocol, and he moved with my courageous mother 
and his typically horizonless optimism into a nearby hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 And so on Yom Kippur, I always see his face the first day that he returned 
home after three months at his miracle center in Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 His voice was a whisper. His lips were blistered. He could scarcely gulp water 
without wincing. His normally tan, smooth, handsome skin had a dull yellow 
cast. His graceful brown eyes bulged out of his taut skull. 
</P>
<P>
 He gripped me hard around the shoulders, and in this great man's bony grasp I 
felt real terror. 
</P>
<P>
 By then I thought I had toughened to the idea of cancer and the ebb and flow 
of battle. But I learned that I was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not a fight, it was a weary retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 My younger sister usually sits beside me during these Yiskor services as the 
rabbi prods our memories with moving poems from the liturgy and his own manila 
folders, and I never ask her what she's thinking. I only feel her cold hand in 
mine, and I hear her sobbing. 
</P>
<P>
 Our father suffered beyond measure in his final weeks as we watched, useless. 
Even as he described the disease to us as sharp knives thrusting through his 
skin toward daylight -- and even as he said he felt his bones bursting from the 
pressure of cancerous growth -- we could not bring ourselves to slyly crank up 
the dial on his precious morphine and offer him the sweet elixir of a fatal 
dose. 
</P>
<P>
 For even in pain, even at his worst, we felt he was better off alive with us 
than dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Other days of the year, I see my father in full flush of his proud life -- a 
generous man, ingenious and brave without limit. He knew a million jokes and 
had 2 million friends. He had a human understanding so rich that you felt he 
could look into your eyes and read your soul. 
</P>
<P>
 On Yom Kippur, I see him only in his suffering, and for once let myself look 
back into his baleful eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a day of memories. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly bad ones. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a day of atonement.

VALUES OF '50S 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding "Society Fails the Next Generation," Column Left, by Ruth Rosen 
(Aug. 30), there are two points I wish to raise. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prof. Rosen mentions that various women's group are helping young ladies to 
deal with "financial disaster, physical abuse and emotional deprivation."Since 
when are these problems only important to women? I always thought these issues 
affect all humans, male and female alike. 
</P>
<P>
 * She also says that "male counterparts still dream of Ronald Reagan's 
rosy-tinted mythic 1950s" and they need to "understand the economic and social 
changes that have transformed American society." These changes have led to high 
crime rates, out-of-control social spending that is bankrupting the country, 
declining achievements in schools, a massive drug-abuse problem, babies being 
born to teen-agers with no morals, education, or financial support to give to 
their children, and a more divided, dangerous society than the 1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 I fully support the rights of women to be treated as equals in the workplace 
and that men should share the responsibilities at home. However, Rosen (and her 
whining feminist friends) should embrace the lessons of the 1950s, not attack 
them as evil.

CASTRO'S CUBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We spend millions of much needed dollars broadcasting the word "freedom" to 
the Cuban people while at the same time strangling them with our embargo. Of 
course Cubans suffer from shortages, hunger and disease; we would too if our 
trading partners would impose an embargo on us.The misery the Cubans are 
experiencing is the consequence of our three decades of sanctions, aggravated 
by our cruel deal with Russia to stop supplying and trading with them. We are 
the only superpower now; what threat could tiny Cuba pose to us? 
</P>
<P>
 I voted for President Clinton thinking that he cared for the human race and 
was on the side of justice and goodwill, that he would turn this insane U.S. 
policy around. Instead, we continue sacrificing innocent lives in order to save 
face. Let's not send Cuba back to the days of our protege, the vicious dictator 
Batista. We should lift the embargo now and put an end to this misery.

 * Isn't it ironic that those in charge have decided we can no longer tolerate 
Cuban refugees as they try to escape the regime of Fidel Castro. This attitude 
just typifies our society where we ask our children to be drug-, alcohol- and 
sex-free, while we push pain killers, "lite" beer and free condoms. But now 
comes the ultimate in double talk. We tell the people of poor and politically 
corrupt countries to think freedom but please don't pursue it.

FLEDGLING TEACHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I just finished reading "Fledgling Instructors Try to Ease Staff Shortage" 
(Sept. 4). I was surprised to find that so many vacancies were filled by 
unqualified teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 One month ago I called the Los Angeles Unified School District to request an 
application for special education teacher. I have three California teaching 
credentials and have taught in all areas of special education. I was told that 
there were no available positions, not even for substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 If "the district anticipates needing more than 300 special education teachers 
and probably will have substitutes fill most of those positions," why was I so 
easily dismissed? Obviously the teacher supply does not meet the demand in 
special education. 
</P>
<P>
 Most special education students thrive on stability and consistency. Some 
people are shocked by the behaviors they exhibit. "Bribing with cookies" 
certainly was not a part of my teacher training. 
</P>
<P>
 GAYLE WOODS-BIALEK 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * When I volunteered to teach a two-day workshop on basic teaching skills to 
newly hired LAUSD personnel, I had concerns about people who were going to 
teach with no experience or training. At the end of two days my concerns were 
increased. 
</P>
<P>
 These aspiring teachers approached their new jobs with a real desire to help 
children coupled with a mixture of bravado, anxiety and confusion. Their 
questions ranged from discipline to how to structure a basic reading or math 
lesson. Some, who had begun teaching in July, had bits and pieces put together 
but nothing that made them feel secure or clear about how to proceed. Their 
questions also reflected how inadequate a two-day crash course was going to be: 
Is it permitted to stand children in the corner? How do I get students to pay 
attention? How do you teach fourth-graders with limited reading skills? In the 
two days we were to cover discipline procedures, classroom management, lesson 
planning and writing skills. It was impossible and frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAUSD is now focusing on reform through LEARN; however, these reforms seem 
doomed to failure without trained, experienced teachers to implement new 
approaches in the classroom. Our top high school and college students will not 
select teaching as a profession if they have a minimal salary and limited 
benefits to look forward to after five years of college. Salaries need to be a 
top priority instead of a poor second to new programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the faces I saw in the workshop will not last long in the classroom. 
These people may go on to other careers but the children may have missed the 
opportunity they needed to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 MARJORY WOOLF 
</P>
<P>
 Woodland Hills 
</P>
<P>
 * The article on new schoolteachers (Sept. 6) conveniently excludes a whole 
group of the highest qualified teachers, those who would exult with a starting 
salary of $26,000, those with decades of experience in practical, applied math 
and science, some with 10 to 20 years as part-time teachers, some who would 
outperform even Jaime Escalante himself -- the older aerospace engineers. 
</P>
<P>
 No school district dares to utter the words, but age discrimination seems to 
be the only apparent reason for choosing younger teachers over the older set.

 This writer has over 15 years teaching, over 20 years of engineering, over 370 
college credits, repeating the calculus series to ensure professionalism, was a 
substitute math/physics teacher in nearly 20 school districts, yet is still 
waiting for the first serious offer. In 1982, L.A. Unified begged this engineer 
to teach electronics in the district for $17,500 while volunteering at Narbonne 
High in the adopt-a-school program. Today, the phone is strangely quiet.

 My wife and I decided to take a trip to California so we could get a firsthand 
look at how our billions of tax dollars are being used. 
</P>
<P>
 We traveled mainly in the San Diego and L.A. areas.After a week of travel, we 
determined that the big problem isn't earthquakes, brush fires or mudslides. 
The big problem is that somehow Californians have become out of touch with the 
rest of the U.S. I was appalled at the number of foreign cars I observed in the 
state. I am not sure if Californians are trying to send some kind of message to 
the rest of the U.S. by buying so many foreign vehicles or if this is some kind 
of status symbol. 
</P>
<P>
 My recommendation is if you like the billions of tax dollars sent to your 
state for repairing all the damage, then help generate some of it by buying 
American!

MR. PRESIDENT -- IS THIS REALLY WHAT AMERICA WANTS TO DO?; A HAITI INVASION 
ALONE HARDLY MAKES SENSE; A TOUGH SELL FOR CLINTON TONIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton will address the nation tonight on a possible U.S. invasion 
of Haiti. As in the past when a commitment of military power appeared imminent, 
the President can no doubt count on the initial support of the American people, 
who at such times instinctively rally behind both the commander in chief and 
the men and women he is putting in harm's way. But in the case of Haiti, 
Clinton has a special obligation to be candid and forceful in discussing why 
such a profoundly serious step -- one involving the almost inevitable loss of 
lives among U.S. military personnel and the Haitians who engage them -- is 
necessary. For, as Wednesday's Senate debate on Haiti clearly showed, there is 
great doubt regarding not just the need for U.S. military action but the very 
wisdom of trying to impose any coercive resolution to Haiti's long political 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 A good argument can be made for using force to oust the military junta in 
Port-au-Prince. Its members are an extremely unpleasant lot who three years ago 
arrested and exiled the first popularly elected president in the nation's 
history, Jean-Bertrand Aristide. Since then they have resisted U.N. efforts to 
restore Aristide that used both the carrot of diplomacy and the stick of 
economic sanctions. A year ago the junta even went so far as to sign and then 
arrogantly reject a U.N. agreement for Aristide to return. In the meantime the 
junta has harshly suppressed the Haitian people, killing hundreds and driving 
thousands more into desperate exile in the United States and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The best argument Clinton has for using U.S. power to restore Aristide is the 
fact that during the nine months the former Roman Catholic priest was in the 
presidency the flow of illegal immigrants from Haiti to the United States 
declined. That is no small achievement, especially when viewed from states like 
California and Florida that feel the impact of illegal immigration most 
directly. So while Aristide may be a controversial figure in the United States, 
he was so popular in Haiti that he was elected with more than 67% of the vote 
and was so admired that he inspired many poor Haitians to stay home rather than 
flee abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 While Aristide clearly should be returned to the presidency to which he was 
honestly and openly elected, the tougher question facing Clinton would be how 
to keep Aristide in power once U.S. military forces achieved the initial 
objective of defeating the junta. No serious military analyst doubts U.S. 
forces could easily overwhelm Haiti's military. And while U.S. casualties of 
any number would be painful, most experts believe they would be light. The real 
military challenge that Haiti poses is what to do once we're there. In other 
words, getting in would be relatively easy; getting out may be hard. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton must not forget that the last time U.S. troops intervened in a Haitian 
political crisis, in 1915, they wound up staying for 19 years. And 60 years 
after the last U.S. troops left Haiti there is precious little evidence the 
troubled nation is better off for that U.S. intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible, of course, that all the invasion preparations are a bluff -- 
aimed at pushing the junta's leaders into fleeing to exile like other Caribbean 
dictators before them. If so, we fervently hope it works. But before any 
fighting begins, the Administration should explain what U.S. forces would do 
once the violence ended. What plan, for instance, does it have to assist 
Aristide in nation-building once he is restored? 
</P>
<P>
 The only real guarantee the American public will have that U.S. troops won't 
have to intervene in Haiti again, sometime in the next century, is for that 
nation to be transformed from the poorest country in the Western Hemisphere to 
a stable democracy with a modicum of prosperity for its people. That's a much 
tougher task than defeating a ragtag army. 
</P>
<P>
 An invasion per se is doable -- and maybe even justifiable, but it is hard to 
see how it would solve Haiti's deep political and economic problems. In the 
final analysis, President Clinton needs to lay out a far more convincing 
long-range game plan than he has to date.

BARRY'S BACK, AND THAT'S BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marion Barry, the former mayor of Washington, has risen phoenix-like from the 
ashes of a crack cocaine pipe. By winning a plurality in Tuesday's Democratic 
primary in a city where Democrats outnumber Republicans 9 to 1, he is more than 
likely to regain the office that he left in disgrace after he was videotaped 
smoking crack, the scourge of most of the major cities of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Though an ex-convict, Barry cannot be denied legally. He was convicted of 
misdemeanor drug charges but acquitted of more serious felony charges that 
would have stripped him of his right to vote but not to hold office. He did his 
time and is entitled to all citizenship rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry prevailed because he is a superb politician who out-organized his 
opponents. Those who bewail his primary victory Tuesday -- as we certainly do 
-- need to acknowledge this. He concentrated on poor blacks and courted the 
many voters who received jobs when he swelled the city government during his 
three terms as mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's hard to see how his victory does anything for the perennially 
troubled city of Washington. Barry's comeback will exacerbate the on-going 
exodus of middle-class taxpayers of all races. In addition, his return is 
likely to aggravate members of Congress who control the district's red-stained 
budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry orated on and on about his personal redemption. Fair enough -- 
politicians can err in their personal lives like everyone else. But this 
election, as one of Barry's primary opponents put it, is not about the 
redemption of one man's soul. It is about a city's redemption.

THERE IS NO JOY IN MUDVILLE; BASEBALL CLUB OWNERS AND PLAYERS -- AND THE FANS 
-- HAVE STRUCK OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The baseball season has been canceled. The owners have borrowed a line from 
the Gershwins and said, in effect, let's call the whole thing off. Somehow 
Americans will fill their calendars in September and October, traditionally the 
autumnal provinces of pennant races, playoffs and the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 What if the games had resumed and nobody came or cared? It's a delicious 
thought of vengeance for the only authentically aggrieved party in the 1994 
baseball strike, the American public. 
</P>
<P>
 Somebody asked baseball's acting commissioner, Bud Selig, during his news 
conference Wednesday to explain just what would be in it for the fans once this 
messy dispute was resolved. Well? One might have expected his response to 
present a rousing portrait of the national pastime, a conjuring of wonderful 
games just on the other side of labor troubles. Instead, the response was like 
something out of a graduate labor relations seminar, a rambling speech on how 
difficult it is to understand the complexity of modern economics. 
</P>
<P>
 Give us a break. Neither the owners nor the players get it. America turns to 
baseball precisely because it is not like everything else. But ever loyal in 
our expectations, we fans will in all probability be there. Baseball's warring 
factions seem to take this as a given. In past work stoppages, we have obliged 
them ever so willingly. Why else would they put us through the disingenuous 
posturing of recent weeks? 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have wrecked a season by holding fast to a salary cap proposal that 
from the beginning was received by players as warmly as a brushback pitch. In 
this "anything but new taxes" climate for business, the players proposed that 
the owners put a levy on themselves to address financial inequities. 
</P>
<P>
 Would that we had the resolve to make both sides sweat to recapture our 
enthusiasm. This year as never before, the participants have treated us 
shabbily indeed, going out of their way to overwhelm our sentiments with the 
knowledge that, for them, this dispute is merely a matter of dollars. Baseball 
fans know all about strategy. But mostly they know that baseball should be fun. 
They prefer not to have the business side flaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 During this spectacle, there were at least some rumblings of a fan revolt. 
Even Congress with its own wobbly approval ratings could start to look good by 
comparison; it now wants to have an overdue look at baseball's antitrust 
exemption. Good. Go to it. 
</P>
<P>
 While baseball's economic mess gets sorted out, the owners should hire and 
empower a new commissioner. The players might use this time to fully realize 
that few people will ever get paid so much for having so much fun. The rest of 
us maybe can find solace in Ken Burns' forthcoming PBS series on the great 
game's past, and hope for a time when once again we have not only memories and 
film clips but the game itself.

COMMENTARY; PERSPECTIVES ON HAITI; SOLDIERS' BLOOD, TO FILL A VACUUM; RESTORING

 As I write this, our country is preparing for the invasion of Haiti. There is 
now a clock on the operation. U.S. Army aircraft are embarked on U.S. Navy 
ships, and since Army aircraft are not designed for use at sea, a 
salt-corrosive environment, the play-or-pay decision will have to be made in 
fairly short order. Before examining the policy-making process involved here, 
such as it is, we can briefly consider other recent similar actions.  
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Grenada (October, 1983), the precipitating event was the 
imminent danger to several hundred American students on the island. A coup 
eliminated one oddball government for another of unmistakably savage 
proclivities (a demonstration of people supporting the previous government was 
machine-gunned). The Operation Urgent Fury was laid on so rapidly that a friend 
of mine aboard the Independence went to his ship's library to learn about the 
island of Grenada from the Encyclopedia Britannica. He would later win a 
Distinguished Flying Cross for rescuing 13 U.S. soldiers whose helicopter was 
shot down. The returning American students were quite clear in reporting the 
danger they sensed on the island, and we need to remember that the lives of our 
citizens are, in the final analysis, our most important national-security 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Panama (December, 1989), the precipitating events were the 
murder of a Marine officer and the near-rape of the wife of a Navy officer. In 
addition was concern for the security of the Panama Canal, a vital 
national-security asset whose construction was, in fact, the first real step 
America took toward world-power status. 
</P>
<P>
 The Persian Gulf War was about the security of the world's energy supply and 
stability in a region of vital interests to the entire industrialized world. It 
should be noted that some politicians on the left who opposed intervention 
there blithely support the invasion of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti is a country only in the sense that it occupies a place on the map and 
has a flag. It has no economy worth speaking about. Formerly a colony of France 
(the demise of French rule in Haiti went a long way toward making possible 
America's Louisiana Purchase), Haiti was liberated by its own citizens in the 
early 19th Century. That was about the last good thing to happen there. Ruled 
since by despots characterized mainly by brutality and indifference to their 
fellow citizens, Haiti has accomplished little and suffered much. The people on 
that half of the island of Hispaniola live in abject poverty; many of them walk 
across the border to the Dominican Republic, where they are cruelly exploited 
as stoop labor. All these things command our sympathy. 
</P>
<P>
 But sympathy and concern are not the same as a vital national interest. No 
American citizens appear to be at risk. Haiti possesses nothing vital to 
American national-security interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti has had something approaching a democratic election. The president 
elected, a former priest named Jean-Bertrand Aristide is, according to a 
published Central Intelligence Agency evaluation, slightly mad. This 
observation can be confirmed by anyone who watches the exiled president give a 
speech, and by his public support for the murder of his political opponents. 
Neither factor gives one great enthusiasm for re-establishing Aristide to power 
in his country.  
</P>
<P>
 We will recall that two years ago, candidate Bill Clinton excoriated President 
Bush's policy of denying asylum to Haitian refugees as implicitly racist and 
grossly insensitive. There was justice in that observation. Unfortunately, 
President Clinton has failed to find anything approaching a peaceful solution, 
has in effect reinstated and sanctified the Bush policy and has now expanded it 
to Cuban refugees as well for no other apparent reason than that he doesn't 
know what else to do. Unable to solve one problem, Clinton, for what seems the 
first time in U.S. history, has implicitly approved a Marxist country's policy 
of keeping its citizens in slavery while agreeing to Fidel Castro's demand to 
act as a safety valve, bleeding off stress to the only foreign leader who ever 
advocated the use of nuclear weapons against our country (1962, remember?). 
</P>
<P>
 Thus 30 years of consistent policy toward Cuba has been voided by a President 
who took back his own words regarding proper policy toward Haiti. And now, with 
no other intelligent ideas on the horizon, Clinton is preparing to do what many 
weak and indecisive people do when they cannot come up with something. He is 
preparing to order American men and women to risk their lives to underwrite a 
vacuum of policy. 
</P>
<P>
 What is the rationale? 
</P>
<P>
 If we do not invade Haiti, we will have more refugees? (In other words, we 
don't want any more black people in America.) Is that not racist? Expanding the 
idea as we must -- since we want neither Cuban nor Haitian refugees -- it's 
about immigration. I am sure that the Daughters of the American Revolution will 
be delighted to hear that their long-standing prejudice is now backed up by all 
the muscle the Pentagon can summon. 
</P>
<P>
 We must restore democracy in Haiti? But Haiti is a country whose history of 
democracy is as lengthy as its history of prosperity, and the leader we propose 
to reinstate is reportedly unstable and definitely possessed of an eccentric 
attitude toward political opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 We have a duty to help countries in need? Our military is not sufficiently 
large to bring justice to every nation on the globe that suffers under 
despotism. That is the reason we try to limit the use of force to arenas that 
bear directly on the security of our country. The people who wear our country's 
uniform volunteer and train for that mission. 
</P>
<P>
 But Haiti does not meet that test. What we have here is policy by default. 
Unable to "smart our way" out of this entirely artificial crisis -- and having 
expanded its implications to our relations with yet another country -- we are 
now about to put the lives of our service people at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Clinton not left his own country for another during time of war, perhaps 
he would know that entering another country under arms is quite a bit easier 
than leaving it in a peaceful condition. As a part of the Vietnam opposition, 
he ought to remember that engaging in armed conflict is never a trivial 
exercise, and most certainly not when the average citizen does not support the 
cause in question. And as one who evaded military service, perhaps he needs to 
be reminded that the young Americans in uniform are real people who bleed real 
blood and whose lives are supposed to be as important to the civilian officials 
who send them into danger as they are to the family members who will put 
flowers on their graves.

MAKE IT 'SOS' FOR SNAKE-OIL SALESMEN; PROPOSITION 187: WHO'S BEHIND THIS 
NOXIOUS NOSTRUM? TWO EX-BUREAUCRATS WHO FAILED TO ENFORCE IMMIGRATION LAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL SHUSTERMAN, Carl Shusterman is a former trial attorney for the Los 
Angeles office of the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a former U.S. Immigration and Naturalization Service prosecutor who for 
years helped to deport illegal aliens, I support strict enforcement of federal 
immigration laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, it makes me furious that two mothballed bureaucrats -- Alan 
Nelson and Harold Ezell -- have sponsored a November ballot proposition whose 
passage could expel thousands of children from our public schools, all in the 
name of immigration control. Although they call their idea the "save our state" 
or "SOS" initiative, a better description would be the "snake-oil salesmen" 
initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the credentials of the two sponsors. Nelson was commissioner of the 
INS throughout most of the 1980s. Ezell was INS western regional commissioner, 
Nelson's right-hand man in California. Both were political appointees with no 
previous immigration experience or expertise. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Congress gave them a forceful new weapon in the war against illegal 
immigration: the power to fine and jail the employers of illegal aliens. What 
was their track record in prosecuting employers who violated the 1986 law? 
Suffice it to say that not a single employer of illegal aliens went to jail 
during their tenure. Their failure to vigorously enforce the employer-sanctions 
provisions of the Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, to beef up the 
Border Patrol or to modernize the INS' antiquated record-keeping system helped 
send our illegal-alien problem spinning out of control. 
</P>
<P>
 How is it, then, that Nelson and Ezell have suddenly emerged to propose that 
California adopt its own immigration policy -- one that targets schoolchildren 
rather than illegal workers or their employers? Nelson is a lobbyist for the 
conservative Federation for American Immigration Reform, which opposes not only 
illegal immigration but most legal immigration as well. Ezell is now an 
immigration consultant who assists high-rolling foreign businessmen obtain U.S. 
visas. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 187 would force school districts to refuse to enroll students who 
could not produce papers proving their legal status. Even children who are 
citizens would be forced to turn over information to the state about the 
immigration status of their parents. All suspicious information would be turned 
over to the local INS office, where already overworked investigators would have 
to dig through piles of paperwork in search of illegal aliens. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the 1986 law claim that it is not working because illegal workers 
use fake documents to gain employment. If Proposition 187 passes, we will be 
faced with the spectacle of children presenting fake birth certificates and 
green cards to their teachers. This is a good way to subsidize the 
illegal-document trade, but is it a good way to enforce our immigration laws? 
</P>
<P>
 The sponsors of this initiative should heed the truism that those who refuse 
to learn from the mistakes of the past are doomed to repeat them. As recently 
as 1982, the Supreme Court struck down as unconstitutional a Texas law very 
similar to the SOS initiative. The majority justices held that "penalizing the 
. . . child is an ineffectual -- as well as unjust -- way of deterring the 
parent." 
</P>
<P>
 Even the dissenting justices agreed that "it is senseless for an enlightened 
society to deprive any children -- including illegal aliens -- of an elementary 
education . . . and that it would be folly -- and wrong -- to tolerate creation 
of a segment of society made up of illiterate persons." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson, Ezell and their backers should be honest with voters: Immigration 
policy is made in Washington, not Sacramento. We already spend more than $1 
billion a year funding the INS. Nelson and Ezell had their chance and failed to 
make an impact when they ran the agency in the 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
 Most California voters are naturally fed up with illegal immigration, but we 
are sophisticated enough to know that depriving children of an education will 
only make matters worse without making a dent in illegal immigration. Presented 
with the facts, I believe voters will turn down the initiative. Nelson and 
Ezell will have to peddle their snake oil somewhere else.

POLITICAL NOTE; LOST OPPORTUNITY

<P>
 The California gubernatorial candidates would have us believe that they would 
love to break clear of the handlers and image-makers and share with the voters 
the authentic nature of their candidacies. 
</P>
<P>
 But I can't help recalling a July invitation from Cardinal Roger Mahony to 
both candidates to participate in a late August forum in Los Angeles. It would 
have been a dialogue, not a debate, to discuss public-policy issues including 
health care, crime, immigration and welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, Gov. Pete Wilson and Treasurer Kathleen Brown rejected out of 
hand a unique opportunity to engage in serious and substantive discourse on 
pivotal issues. No wonder not only the press but also the public is cynical 
about the current political season.

ART REVIEW; IMAGES OF 'SANTOS': FASCINATING PORTRAIT OF CATHOLIC DEVOTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER KNIGHT, TIMES ART CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid the often aggressively publicized loan exhibitions a museum presents, its 
permanent collection can quietly languish in the background. But the art a 
museum makes a commitment to acquire and preserve is in fact the institution's 
spine, without which it tosses on the tides of passing fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 Temporary loan shows are significant, but the collection's the thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Ample evidence in support of this creed will be found in "Images of Penance, 
Images of Mercy: Santos and Ceremonies of the Hispanic Southwest," which opened 
this week in the Williamson Gallery at Pasadena's Art Center College of Design. 
Organized three years ago, this absorbing show grew out of an effort to finish 
cataloguing the collection of santos , or Catholic devotional paintings and 
sculptures of Christian saints, housed at the Taylor Museum for Southwestern 
Studies at the Colorado Springs Fine Arts Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The Taylor Museum, specializing in the Native American and Hispanic material 
culture of the southwestern United States, is home to 15,000 artifacts. Of 
these, about 750 are santos , ranging in date from the early 1700s to the 
present day. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition focuses on a specific aspect of that collection, one that its 
curator, William Wroth, puzzled out while cataloguing the museum's holdings. 
Wroth noted that, among the Taylor Museum's 125 or so santos dating from the 
late-19th Century, a preponderance of images were associated with the Passion 
and Crucifixion of Christ. That subject, while hardly uncommon in the earlier 
art of Spain's New World colonies, appeared with far greater concentration in 
New Mexico in the decades after the American Occupation of 1846. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus was born "Images of Penance, Images of Mercy," which chronicles the 
impact and tenacity of a Catholic lay order long active in New Mexico. Formally 
called the Brotherhood of Our Father Jesus Nazarene, and popularly known as the 
Penitentes, the order's original name more tellingly describes the emotional 
and spiritual depth of its religious commitments: The Brotherhood of the Blood 
of Christ, as they first named themselves, lived their lives according to the 
example of the suffering and execution of Jesus. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The santos inspired by the Brotherhood do chronicle the miraculous powers of 
assorted saints, but special prominence is given to figures of a suffering 
Christ and a sorrowful Virgin Mary. In a way, the retablos (paintings) and 
bultos (statues) depicting the Passion are vessels into which the penitent 
viewer pours his own earthly suffering, in a mystical ritual of purification of 
the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 About 50 retablos and a like number of bultos are on view. Among the most 
powerful is a 3-foot-tall figure of Jesus, carved by an unidentified artist 
today known as the Abiquiu Santero. 
</P>
<P>
 The figure's body is hidden inside voluminous, blood-red robes, sewn from 
cotton and lace and reminiscent of those worn by a cardinal. The slightly 
downturned head, fitted with human hair and a spiky crown of thorns, creates an 
extraordinary vision of transcendent suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Carved from cottonwood with a delicate simplicity and a soft, almost geometric 
regularity, its forehead is streaked with blood from the wounds of the crown, 
its cheeks with tears of blood that stream from its eyes. Still, the placid 
face stares serenely into infinity. 
</P>
<P>
 The figure stands atop a litter, on which it would be carried during Holy Week 
processionals. These New Mexican santos retain elements of European medieval 
religious function, while acting as theatrical props for a communal pageant. 
Rendered in a style that might be called "folk Baroque," they record the 
stresses and strains of a period of profound social and technological upheaval 
and of the difficult endurance of a specific religious belief. 
</P>
<P>
 Imagine the moment. Late-19th Century New Mexico saw a dizzying clash of world 
views -- between Catholic Hispanics and Protestant Americans, between spiritual 
faith and earthly wealth, between traditional Catholicism and an urge to 
modernize the religion, between agricultural society and industrial capitalism. 
The show begins before 1860, so that resulting shifts in the fabrication of 
santos can be witnessed: the replacement of hand-hewn planks with milled wood, 
for example, and of transparent, fragile, water-based tempera with opaque, 
durable, oil-based house paints. 
</P>
<P>
 A remarkable and poignant juxtaposition pairs a chromolithograph of the 
elaborately dressed Santo Nino de Atocha with a sweet drawing in crayon and 
pencil, which closely mimics it. By century's end the arrival of inexpensive, 
mass-produced chromolithographs had pretty much eradicated the tradition of 
hand-painted retablos . And the commercial proliferation of plaster saints 
began to intrude on the centuries-long artisanal production of bultos . 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The greatest resistance to the period's tumultuous changes came from the 
Penitentes, whose rituals included self-flagellation in simulation of Christ's 
trials. Their tenacious hold on traditional religious faith assured that santos 
depicting the Passion would continue to be made long after those of other 
Catholic sects disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 The show at Art Center lays out the fascinating and complex story -- almost in 
too much detail. Heavily didactic, the objects are nearly overwhelmed with 
printed labels. (The catalogue accompanying the show is excellent.) The 
paintings and statues sometimes have to fight for prominence amid the welter of 
words. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they manage to hold their own. In this, the santos are not unlike the 
Brotherhood of the Blood of Christ, to which they owe their often amazing 
creation.

 Opera Goes Cable: In the largest commitment ever to presenting opera on cable 
TV, Bravo's "Texaco Performing Arts Showcase" will feature six productions from 
New York's Metropolitan Opera over the next three years. The programming starts 
Sept. 28 with Puccini's "Tosca," sung by Hildegard Behrens, Placido Domingo and 
Cornell MacNeil, with Giuseppe Sinopoli conducting and sets by Franco 
Zeffirelli. Future broadcasts include "Il Trovatore," sung by Eva Marton, 
Dolora Zajick, Luciano Pavarotti and Sherrill Milnes, and "Aida" with Aprile 
Millo and Domingo. The showcase will also feature on Oct. 5 the U.S. TV 
premiere of "Cecilia Bartoli in Recital," taped at London's Savoy Hotel.

 Stern Wake-Up Call: Howard Stern, the self-proclaimed "King of All Media," was 
boasting on radio Wednesday morning about his outstanding TV ratings on cable's 
E! Entertainment. But advertisers report that "Howard Stern" averages no more 
than a 0.3 rating on E! in its choicest 8 p.m. slot (it runs three times a 
day), translating to 84,000 U.S. homes. That's less than the numbers earned by 
Stern's latest whipping boy, Comedy Central's "Politically Incorrect" host Bill 
Maher. Stern criticized Maher's TV ratings on his radio program this week, when 
in fact new episodes of "Incorrect" averaged 96,000 homes last season at 11:30 
p.m., when fewer viewers are available. Inside word is that E! executives are 
concerned their hefty investment in Stern's TV show is not paying off. The real 
TV talk king? David Letterman, whose top-rated "Late Show" on CBS averages 5.4 
million homes a night. MOVIES

 13th Life for 'Cats': Andrew Lloyd Webber may have abruptly yanked his "Sunset 
Boulevard" out of the Shubert Theatre, but his presence will still be felt with 
the Shubert's next show: a two-week (Oct. 25-Nov. 6) engagement of that 
perennial favorite "Cats," by none other than Lloyd Webber. This will be the 
fourth appearance of "Cats" at the Shubert and its 13th stop in Los Angeles and 
Orange counties.

 A Night With LuPone: Actress Patti LuPone, who was Lloyd Webber's first Norma 
Desmond in London, will perform numbers from her various Broadway and London 
stage roles in "An Evening With Patti LuPone," an Oct. 2 benefit for the 
National Gay and Lesbian Task Force. The event, at the Regent Beverly Wilshire 
Hotel, will also honor Sen. Paul D. Wellstone (D.-Minn.) for his outspoken 
support of gay and lesbian causes. ART

 Getty Fight Continues: Malibu's J. Paul Getty Museum has suffered yet another 
loss in its fight to acquire Antonio Canova's sculpture "The Three Graces." On 
Tuesday, the museum lost a legal challenge against the British government when 
a London court ruled that a three-month fund-raising extension, granted by the 
British Heritage secretary and effectively allowing the statue to be kept in 
Britain, was not unreasonable. Getty director John Walsh said the museum was 
"naturally disappointed" by the ruling but would take its battle to the British 
Court of Appeals. If unsuccessful, the case would go to the European Court of 
Justice. The Getty is arguing that by extending the deadline, the Heritage 
secretary changed the rules and breached a legally enforceable legitimate 
expectation. After the extension, the Victoria and Albert Museum and the 
National Galleries of Scotland were able to match the Getty's price of 
7.6-million pounds with donations from John Paul Getty II and Baron 
Thyssen-Bornemisza. QUICK TAKES

Leno pops up in a later time slot tonight when he guests on NBC's "Later With 
Greg Kinnear." . . . Oprah Winfrey has donated $3 million to Chicago's Jane 
Addams Hull House Assn., which works to move poor families from subsidized 
housing to independent living. . . . Director Martin Scorsese has joined

JAZZ REVIEW; PIANIST MCCOY TYNER AT HIS AMIABLE BEST AT JAZZ BAKERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON HECKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 McCoy Tyner may be the most influential under-recognized pianist in 
contemporary jazz. His highly personal style, profuse with dense note clusters 
and intricate rhythms, has impacted a wide spectrum of younger players, despite 
his relative unfamiliarity to the wider jazz audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem may be that Tyner's performances can be difficult for 
casual listeners, and noticeably so when he elects to dip heavily into 
unfamiliar repertoire. But he was at his amiable best with his trio at the Jazz 
Bakery on Tuesday night, ranging through a set of tunes that demonstrated the 
breadth, if not always the complete depth, of his substantial talents. 
</P>
<P>
 Pieces such as "Have You Met Miss Jones" and "In a Mellow Tone" were showcases 
for Tyner's remarkable ability to time-shift the rhythm. At times he multiplied 
it into sharp, rapid-fire bursts of notes; at other times he toyed with the 
meter, punching out razor-thin, but always precise chordal syncopations. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyner was especially impressive in an illuminating solo piano rendering of the 
old standard "We'll Be Together Again." Moving freely across styles and eras, 
he combined bits and snatches of be-bop, stride piano and Coltranesque rhythmic 
complexities into his own lush harmonic vision. His innate feel for timbral 
subtleties, not especially apparent when his rhythm section was playing, was on 
full display. It was a splendid revelation of how a mature jazz artist -- Tyner 
is 55 -- with desire and determination can persistently push open the envelope 
of his skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyner's longtime musical companions, bassist Avery Sharpe and drummer Aaron 
Scott, provided the kind of easy, almost symbiotic support that only comes with 
continuing artistic association. Unfortunately, the Bakery's still unfocused 
audio system tended to blur their playing. One wonders whether a trio such as 
Tyner's might not be better heard, in this setting, with no electronic 
amplification at all, other than a slight boost for Sharpe's bass. 
</P>
<P>

POP BEAT: A STRONG START, A NICE RETURN

<P>
 Today's menu of local album releases ranges from Peter Fahey's long-delayed 
debut to the Chantays' impressive surf-rock comeback with their first album in 
30 years. Also, the Leaving Trains' latest release serves as a fittingly raw 
yet catchy hail-and-farewell for the late Fullerton record producer, Chaz 
Ramirez. Ratings range from * (poor) to **** (excellent). Three stars denote a 
solid recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 *** The Chantays "Next Set" 
</P>
<P>
 While Dick Dale has won deserved acclaim for his thunderous '93-94 return to 
recording and touring action, the Chantays' first new album since 1964 makes it 
clear that he doesn't have the market cornered when it comes to auspicious 
comebacks by vintage O.C. surf-rockers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next Set" also makes it clear that there is more than one way to ride the 
surf-instrumental wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale's method on his comeback albums, "Tribal Thunder" and "Unknown 
Territory," calls for a wild, barely harnessed unleashing of elemental force. 
The Chantays -- whose '94 lineup includes founding guitarists Brian Carman and 
Bob Spickard and the band's original drummer, Bob Welch -- show that it is 
possible to arrive at powerful and dramatic ends with means that are guided by 
a classicist's sense of restraint. 
</P>
<P>
 The pleasures of "Next Set" come not from any sudden explosions, but from the 
sureness and inevitability with which the Chantays' architectural 
song-blueprints unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Guitar themes are stated, developed and built upon with interweaving or 
harmonized passages, with some lines clean, and others drenched in the 
traditional surf-spume of reverb. Drums and bass get ample space along with the 
team of three guitars. (The all-guitarslineup is a change from the early '60s, 
when the Chantays also featured electric piano; for fun, listen to the 
Chantays' original "Pipeline" back-to-back with the Doors' "Riders on the 
Storm," then see how much you're willing to wager that the Doors' pianist, Ray 
Manzarek, was a surf-rock fan.) It's all put together in lean, shifting 
arrangements that generate motion, drama and grandeur without ever seeming 
overblown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chantays' new compositions, "Killer Dana," "Bailout at Frog Rock" and 
"South Swell," are all highlights, small epics that stand up well with the 
surf-classics that round out the album and make it a fine introduction to surf 
rock in general. 
</P>
<P>
 Carman and Spickard have rearranged their own 1963 hit, "Pipeline," perhaps 
the most sublime artifact ever concocted by two 16-year-olds goofing off with 
guitars in a suburban bedroom, as well as two Spanish-flavored oldies from the 
Chantays' first album, "El Conquistador" and "Blunderbus." (Dale duplicated the 
main theme from "Blunderbus" on "Shredded Heat," which is credited to Dale 
himself on the "Tribal Thunder" album.) 
</P>
<P>
 Also included are valuable remakes of excellent surf-rock standards by the 
Bel-airs, the Astronauts and the Pyramids. The only misstep on this 
well-chosen, well-wrought album is the zillionth remake of the overexposed 
"Riders in the Sky." 
</P>
<P>
 (Available from the Chantays, 34184B Coast Highway, Box 236, Dana Point, CA 
92629.)  
</P>
<P>
 * The Chantays play Friday at the Heritage Brewing Co., 24921 Dana Point 
Harbor Drive, Dana Point. 9 p.m. (714) 240-2060. *** Peter Fahey "Astral 
Skyline" 
</P>
<P>
 Oxygen Records Fahey is a singer-songwriter from the old school, down to the 
strummed guitar and the harmonica in a brace around his neck. "Astral Skyline," 
his debut release, is a mellow, low-keyed EP (the title might be cosmic in 
intent, but one would prefer to take it as a tongue-in-cheek play on the titles 
of Van Morrison's moody "Astral Weeks" and Bob Dylan's mellow "Nashville 
Skyline.") 
</P>
<P>
 The tone throughout its six songs is wistful as wistful can be -- we're 
talking Jackson Browne-like buckets of gentle ruefulness. Like the Buck Owens 
of "Together Again," the country-influenced Fahey sounds steeped in sadness 
even when he sings, in "Fallin'," about finding a true, sustaining love. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Astral Skyline" will be just the thing for those who'd like a warm, 
sweetly melancholic soak, it doesn't get soppy or overly sentimental. Fahey is 
careful not to overplay his emotions, keeping his pleasant, homespun voice 
(which can sound at times like a less crusty John Prine or a less ragged Jules 
Shear) keyed to a pitch of dignified restraint that rises only momentarily to 
full-on pleading. 
</P>
<P>
 He has enough faith in his simple, direct and tuneful songwriting not to 
strain for effect. It's a faith well-placed. 
</P>
<P>
 Fahey's co-producer, Joe Simon, does a fine job of paralleling the singer's 
own approach by giving the music warm, rippling textures without letting things 
get saccharine or overstuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran musician on the local scene who has always impressed with his 
roots-steeped keyboards playing, Simon makes like a poor man's Benmont Tench as 
he applies a delicate Hammond organ whir. 
</P>
<P>
 But the instrumental star here is Greg Leisz, the gifted former Fullertonian 
who adds just-so teardrop pedal steel lines to a couple of countrified ballads, 
and brings David Lindley's work on Jackson Browne's early albums to mind with 
his soaring lap steel solo on "Someday." 
</P>
<P>
 If the new adult-alternative station, KSCA (101.9-FM), wants to establish some 
grass-roots credentials by jumping on the bandwagon of a deserving, unknown, 
unsigned local, Fahey would be a worthy candidate. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 *** The Leaving Trains "The Big Jinx" 
</P>
<P>
 SST This album by the long-running L.A. band the Leaving Trains is one of the 
last records overseen by Chaz Ramirez at his Fullerton studio, the Casbah. As a 
producer and engineer, Ramirez was a key ally of Social Distortion and worked 
with scores of other O.C. rockers both well-known and obscure. 
</P>
<P>
 At his death from an accidental fall late in 1992, he was engineering this 
Leaving Trains release, and leader Falling James Moreland had officially 
inducted him into the band as its bassist. 
</P>
<P>
 While the whimsical Falling James might be capable of starting an album with 
three minutes and 16 seconds of an actual train's rumbling approach and 
departure just for the heck of it (or to outdo Brian Wilson's "Pet Sounds" coda 
by about 2 1/2 minutes), in this context it sounds like a farewell to Chaz and 
a commentary on the transitory nature of things. The train tapes return 
(mercifully briefly) at the middle and end of the album. 
</P>
<P>
 With Chaz playing some guitar and a bit of drums as well as bass, the Leaving 
Trains' basic sound is hefty, loud and garagey. The exceptions come in 
Moreland's more arty, self-consciously deep moments. 
</P>
<P>
 He burrows into a heavy, gothic-psychedelic mood with the Jim Morrison-like "A 
Woman's Clouds" (a portrait of a drug-abusing, sensation-craving protagonist, 
it invites speculation that Moreland might have been thinking about his 
now-famous ex-wife, Courtney Love). 
</P>
<P>
 The song's thematic and stylistic bookend on the album is "Chloroformality," a 
gloomy piece with oceanic sweep that sounds like Nick Cave-goes-to-Seattle. 
Both songs contain the baleful line, "In the absence of feeling, even pain is a 
pleasure." 
</P>
<P>
 While those tracks are keepers, the Leaving Trains are really in their element 
when they turn themselves into a rough, wryly antagonistic garage-punk band. 
With Moreland braying like Ian Hunter or Joe Strummer or copping a Lou Reed 
deadpan attitude, the band bangs its way through hard-charging rockers like the 
N.Y. Dolls-inspired "Ice Cream Truck" and the slamming but melodic punk songs 
"Nothing Left" and "Go A-(Expletive) Head." 
</P>
<P>
 The darkly romantic "Blacklist" has some Clash/Social Distortion echoes as 
Moreland celebrates the outlaw-outsider spirit he has always cultivated. The 
country-punk ditty, "Can't Afford to Die" is a lighthearted statement of 
noncomformist purpose, in which, among other things, the famously 
cross-dressing Falling James defends his transvestite proclivities.

<P>
 Less reliant on novelty and overt acting-out than some past Leaving Trains 
releases, "The Big Jinx" is still a messy and unpredictable mixture from a band 
that wants to make serious, anguished art without relinquishing the right to be 
impulsive and bratty. Both sides have their appeal.

MUSIC REVIEW; STRONG SINGING, CONDUCTING IN 'DIE WALKURE' AT THE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Admirable in intention, respectable in execution, John Mauceri's solidly 
conducted performance of Act III of Wagner's "Die Walkure" at Hollywood Bowl 
Tuesday night promised much, but delivered less. Of course it sang. But it 
seldom soared. 
</P>
<P>
 A recognized master of canny programming, Mauceri put on this unstaged -- but 
mood-lit and laser-punctuated -- act as a delayed outdoor encore to his indoor 
performances last spring of the entire work at Opera Pacific in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 With some changes: While his Brunnhilde, Scottish singer Jane Eaglen, remained 
the same, the conductor resorted to a more famous and accomplished Wotan than 
the one he had engaged in Orange County. Seven of the remaining Valkyries had 
served the same functions at those earlier performances. And the new Sieglinde 
became the very promising Patricia Baskerville, heard here at the Bowl in July 
in Mauceri's "Porgy and Bess" excerpts. 
</P>
<P>
 The symphonic ensemble, which in March had numbered 71 players stuffed into 
the Performing Arts Center pit in Costa Mesa, became this time the game, 
81-member Hollywood Bowl Orchestra. Though much of its playing emerged adequate 
but blunt, largely uncolored in terms of a broad dynamic scheme and short on 
telling details, this ensemble nevertheless seemed to outplay its Orange County 
counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 Eaglen's singing, faithfully microphoned, apparently without distortion for 
the nearly 18,000-capacity amphitheater, made a stronger impact this time 
around. Consistency, in both articulation and vocal production, is its virtue, 
clarity its strength. The voice may not be distinctive but it is pure of tone; 
equally important, its delivery of words proved reliable, at least in these 
favorable conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Robert Hale is a more engaged singing actor than Mauceri's previous 
Wotan, the closing scene of this Act III took on an added poignancy, especially 
since Eaglen seems to have deepened her characterization of Brunnhilde since 
last we encountered it. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, and despite his healthy, robust voice, the 57-year-old American 
singer brought less energy and a less commanding delivery to the god's 
authority. Here was a touching portrayal, but one still lacking some facets of 
this complex personality. 
</P>
<P>
 Baskerville, so impressive at her last Bowl appearance, produced unfocused 
singing and textual mysteries as a rather undefined Sieglinde. Variable in 
tone-quality, but impassioned in statement were the eight Valkyries: Katherine 
McCloskey (Gerhilde), Deborah Dey (Grimgerde), Anita Protich (Helmwige), Cass 
Powell (Ortlinde), Cindy Sadler (Schwertleite), Kate Butler (Siegrune), 
Patricia McAfee (Waltraute) and Martha Jane Weaver (Rossweise). 
</P>
<P>
 Postscripts: 
</P>
<P>
 * The performance was heard on this occasion by an audience counted at 9,265. 
</P>
<P>
 * The last time "Walkure" was heard at the Bowl was July 12 and 13, 1938, when 
conductor Richard Hageman led two staged performanceswith a cast headed by 
Friedrich Schorr as Wotan, Maria Jeritza as Brunnhilde and Paul Althouse as 
Siegmund.  
</P>
<P>
 * The passing-by of only one aircraft distracted the performance.

ART REVIEWS; PATRICK NICKELL'S STIRRING MIND GAMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KANDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At Kohn Turner Gallery, the pleasures of Patrick Nickell's work elude discrete 
categories. These include the simple satisfaction of a job well done, the high 
of euphoria, the mental gymnastics occasioned by plunging into esoterica and 
the wicked pride of the kid whose smarts lie in his penchant for playing dumb. 
</P>
<P>
 What can one do with small strips of corrugated cardboard, pieces of sheer 
plastic wrap and odd lengths of string? Nickell creates a roomful of 
small-scale, down-market, low-tech, no-gloss sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 These three-dimensional agglomerations of mismatched geometric forms (circles, 
squares and triangles) are tied up with string and swaddled in plastic only to 
be suspended -- vertiginously, even cruelly -- from the wall and from one 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more contrary is their complexity. Defying the mundaneness of their 
materials, these objects play all manner of mind games, masquerading as the 
cacophonous music of truncated symphonies, illegible chemical formula or the 
abstruse structures of microorganisms. Yet they remain firmly abstract, taking 
their place within the history of Modernist abstraction, mixing up the Minimal 
and Baroque strains whose oscillation has long characterized that history. 
</P>
<P>
 With the larger pieces, made of sheet metal and finely meshed screen, Nickell 
does a bit of unnecessary grandstanding, openly referring to any number of 
20th-Century masters: Brancusi, Benglis, Tuttle, Hesse. The title of at least 
one cardboard work refers to David Smith; yet the least convincing of these 
constructions succumb to the literalist impulse that was Smith's undoing. 
</P>
<P>
 One such sculpture mimics the repetitive brush strokes of so-called painterly 
realism. Another configures a loose-limbed marionette whose anthropomorphism 
halts all playfulness dead in its tracks. Yet in Nickell's best work, the play 
is the thing. When he puts aside his bid for posterity (which turns out to be 
self-fulfilling anyway), it is wonderful to watch him exult in possibilities. 
</P>

Closed Sunday, Monday. Classic Memory: "Remember-entering," John Souza's 
installation at Sue Spaid Fine Arts, suggests that the case for the artist's 
eccentricity has been vastly overstated. Appearances aside -- and we're talking 
leather wristbands and other S/M paraphernalia, light fixtures propped on 
wheels like toy trains, Greek columns dangling midair from dime-store hooks, 
and a beige- and white-striped cabana off the beach at Deauville circa 1922 -- 
this is a rather classical show. 
</P>
<P>
 From Souza we might have expected a neo-Pop extravaganza, chaotic 
razzle-dazzle and sinister wit. Here, however, the presentation is balanced and 
orderly. The theme is memory's affair with desire, and the tone is elegiacal. 
</P>
<P>
 Souza dims the lights and fills the gallery with eight portal-cum-coffins. 
Each is propped against the wall, heavily customized and saddled with a title 
whose poetry is discreetly absurd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Past the Moat, the Drip Gate and Iron Doors, the Intruder Advanced Toward the 
Castle's Murder Hole and Ultimate Terror," is a Gothic fantasy, festooned with 
cheap silver chains and flickering electric lights. "We Provisioned Our King 
for His Journey Into the Next World and Slowly Sealed the Tomb for all 
Centuries" pictures King Tut's resting place as it might appear in an MGM 
musical, a bit heavy on the Art Deco flourishes. 
</P>
<P>
 If Souza broaches the classical notion of death as passage, it is only to 
emphasize the ersatz nature of the rituals and artifacts surrounding it. 
Perhaps he's suggesting that our culture's romance with death is played out. 
Mourning has become a matter of choosing the right hardware, and classicism 
just another name for an anti-romantic impulse. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sue Spaid Fine Art, 7454 1/2 Beverly Blvd., (213) 935-6153, through Sept. 
30. Closed Monday, Tuesday. What's Real: At Mark Moore Gallery, Bruce Richards 
demonstrates the recalcitrant allure of hyper-realism. Just a few strokes shy 
of trompe-l'oeil , Richards' painstakingly rendered work is masterful though 
decidedly ironic about the possibilities of mastering anything, much less 
something as slippery as an image. 
</P>
<P>
 In his new work, collectively entitled, "Formal Couples," Richards inverts 
familiar cliches. If clothes are said to make the man, Richards shows us how 
they might unmake him -- and his female counterpart as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Pairs of paintings on paper depict the accouterments of wealth. The first of 
each pair boasts a bow tie and a row of jeweled shirt-studs, the second an 
elaborate necklace of diamonds, emeralds or rubies. 
</P>
<P>
 These luxury items are deceptive. They display a stubborn sameness, 
advertising not wealth but the poverty of imagination engendered at the highest 
levels of consumption. Like the grin of the disembodied Cheshire cat, they 
bespeak absence rather than presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus the high-ticket trinkets offer an oblique comment upon Richards' own 
style, whose mesmerizing wealth of detail and insistent fullness promises 
access to reality that an image can of course never provide. Piling paradox on 
top of irony, Richards offers a seductive but unsettling head trip.

TV REVIEWS; NO BREAKTHROUGHS IN THREE NEW DRAMAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What's that old saw about bad things in show business happening in threes? 
</P>
<P>
 Affirmation comes with tonight's arrival of a trio of fall drama series. CBS 
reruns the two-hour pilot for "Due South," its grittily surreal series about a 
red-coated Canadian Mountie battling criminals in Chicago. ABC exhales a breath 
of stale air titled "McKenna," an outdoorsy adventure set in Oregon. And 
lastly, NBC introduces "Sweet Justice," starring Melissa Gilbert as an urban 
attorney turned Little Lawyer on the Prairie (figuratively speaking). 
</P>
<P>
 Each of these newcomers is watchable, but not for very long. 
</P>
<P>
 In case you missed the two-hour "Due South" first time around, it goes like 
this. When a veteran Mountie is gunned down in Canada's snowy wilderness, his 
Mountie son, Constable Benton Fraser (Paul Gross), trails the hitmen to Chicago 
with his wolf, where he is assigned to the Canadian consulate and is befriended 
by Windy City cop Ray Vecchio (David Marciano). 
</P>
<P>
 While Vecchio is street-smart and coarse, the upstanding Fraser follows a 
rigid code of honor. What, these guys work together? Why, that would be 
impossible! Except on TV, where these clashing partners somehow collaborate on 
the case, much to the dismay of Vecchio's boss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Due South" is rooted in "McCloud," Dennis Weaver's old NBC series about a 
deputy marshal from New Mexico on extended assignment in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Fraser himself, though, is a cross between Sgt. Preston and Forrest Gump -- so 
much of a do-gooder wooden automaton that you keep searching his body for a 
control panel as he mutely stands sentry outside the consulate, allowing 
himself not even a facial tic. Stone-faced, square-shooting and single-minded, 
this guy is the kind of moose who'd walk through a brick wall to get his man. 
</P>
<P>
 Only once is this trait successfully played for laughs, when Vecchio's mother 
wonders why Fraser is "so nice" when he comes to the house for dinner. "He's 
Canadian, Ma," Vecchio says. "I thought he was sick or something," she replies. 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, "Due South" appears uncertain whether to go light or serious, ending 
in a sort of limbo by awkwardly juxtaposing contradictory tones. Late in the 
movie, Fraser is confronted by a moral crossroads, but even this appealing plot 
line is undermined by an ending -- featuring a battle with snow troops -- that 
is so predictable that you know beforehand exactly who will get the drop on 
whom, only to get shot by you know who. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week's episode is, if anything, worse, with Fraser now living blithely in 
a Chicago slum, still mismatched with Vecchio and still dumb as a lox. Yet he's 
smarter than the Chicago cops, who somehow need him to get to the bottom of an 
armed robbery case that implicates a young boy Fraser believes is innocent.  
</P>
<P>
 The word for "Due South" is the same one dogsledders use up north: Mush! 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing about "McKenna" is the gorgeous topography in New Zealand, 
where it was filmed. The setting is supposed to be Bend, Ore., where a 
wilderness-expedition business owned by middle-aged Jack McKenna (Chad Everett) 
has fallen on hard times since the accidental death of his favorite son, Guy. 
</P>
<P>
 That is about to change, however, with the return of Jack's estranged younger 
son, Brick (Eric Close), with his runaway little sister, Cassidy (Vinessa Shaw 
in the premiere, Jennifer Love Hewitt after that). Although father and son open 
old wounds, arguing bitterly, it's Brick who supplies the pat ending for 
"McKenna," arriving just in time when an accident in the wild threatens to end 
Jack's life. 
</P>
<P>
 These are not merely Manly Men, though. In the big scene of the premiere, Jack 
recites William Blake while suspended on a wire high above a canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost as over-the-top are a group of female hikers identified as feminists. 
Aha! That accounts for their asexuality, lack of a sense of humor and dislike 
of children. 
</P>
<P>
 Stereotypes aside, the cast of "McKenna" is too fresh-scrubbed and pretty. 
Brick, Cassidy and Guy's widow, Leigh (Shawn Huff), have that Melrose Place 
Northwest look. And wilderness-chic Jack looks as if he ordered the entire L.L. 
Bean catalogue. If only he'd ordered a script. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As believable drama, "Sweet Justice" is the wilderness, its first two episodes 
confirming what we've always suspected: that a lawyer having little information 
about her case, little time to prepare and little court presence will always 
win. 
</P>
<P>
 If her name is Kate Delacroy and she's played by Melissa Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's premiere and Saturday's second episode (in the show's regular time 
slot) are both ineptly conceived and executed, with Gilbert -- and even her 
more skilled co-star, Cicely Tyson -- lacking what it takes to overcome 
moribund material. 
</P>
<P>
 At no time is Gilbert persuasive as a gifted Wall Street attorney who decides 
to return to her Southern hometown and team with her late mother's friend, 
renowned civil rights leader Carrie Grace Battle (Tyson). Tyson is only 
marginally more successful as a sort of casual, New Age attorney who pads 
around in sweats and spends much of her office time potting plants. 
</P>
<P>
 It turns out that Kate's father (Ronny Cox) not only symbolizes the Old South 
and all its prejudices, but also heads a posh law firm whose snotty, old-monied 
client is pitted against Kate's waitress client in a child custody case 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Kate argues this case, and Saturday's -- involving a wealthy 80-year-old woman 
whose daughters claim she's mentally unfit to manage her affairs -- with scant 
information or time to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 If you can do it off the top of your head, however, why worry? The loopy 
courtroom sequences in both episodes lead to the inevitable results. And 
tonight, despite projecting no strength in the courtroom, she even gets someone 
to make a damaging admission on the stand, Perry Mason-style. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite devoting so much time to the courtroom, neither episode conveys 
conflict or dramatic tension. Nor is there much here that's atmospheric. "Sweet 
Justice" is about as Southern as Col. Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 As Kate's gardening mentor, Tyson has little to do but nod knowingly at the 
right times, spit out aphorisms that make Kate nod knowingly and urge her 
protege to do "the kind of work you were meant to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Potting plants. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Due South" airs at 8 tonight on CBS (Channels 2 and 8). "McKenna" premieres 
at 9 tonight on ABC (Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42). "Sweet Justice" premieres at 10 
tonight and then will be seen Saturdays at 9 p.m. on NBC (Channels 4, 36 and 
39). Also premiering on NBC at 8:30 tonight is "The Martin Short Show," but it 
was not available for review.

WESTSIDE WATCH: A 15TH-CENTURY DRAMA UNFOLDS AT SHOPPING MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If we were to mention drama in the shopping mall, you might imagine the tale 
of a toddler who got separated from his absent-minded parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Think again. Try the Grim Reaper roaming the food court. 
</P>
<P>
 That's part of the drama that the Cornerstone Theater Company has brought to 
Santa Monica Place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyman in the Mall," an updated version of a 15th-Century English play, 
unfolds on escalators and service corridors throughout the mall, and has had 
shoppers doing double takes since it opened last week. To catch the entire 
90-minute show, one must follow the cast as it stops here and there to perform 
scenes. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cornerstone, a low-budget company that is based in Santa Monica but has 
worked in communities all over the nation, the unusual venue seemed a logical 
choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things that struck members of Cornerstone was how much malls are a 
part of American culture from sea to sea," said managing director Stephen 
Gutwillig. "That's not something we're interested in making fun of so much as 
embracing. . . . Thematically 'Everyman' raises questions about what is of 
value in human life." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, using glass elevators and three-story staircases as backdrops was a 
lot cheaper than building a new set. Gutwillig said mall management even 
donated an empty shop for office space and gave cast and crew free run of the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we love about this show is that it draws a lot of 
onlookers," Gutwillig said. 
</P>
<P>
 The show runs through Oct. 9.

 TARGETING HARMAN: A new chapter of the National Rifle Assn. could make trouble 
for Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills), whose district includes Venice, Marina 
del Rey and Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Gun rights advocates formed the NRA Members Council of the South Bay several 
months ago to become more active in local politics. (It also plans a community 
program to teach gun safety). 
</P>
<P>
 Members "were disgusted with what was going on at the federal level," said Ed 
Worley, coordinator of NRA Members Councils in California. "They just didn't 
want to be made felons because they own semiautomatic weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman backed a five-day waiting period for gun ownership and voted last month 
for the crime bill, which includes a ban on assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will not be difficult to get anyone to volunteer against Jane Harman, I 
can tell you that," Worley said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the new chapter's parent group has not decided whether to invest money and 
time in a bid to oust Harman in the November election. For instance, it has not 
endorsed her Republican opponent, Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan 
Brooks, who opposes attempts to restrict gun ownership, with conditions.

MARINA DREDGING PLAN OKD; ENVIRONMENT: PROPOSAL WOULD REMOVE TOXIC SEDIMENT 
FROM CHANNEL AND BURY WASTE AT L.A. HARBOR SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ADRIAN MAHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Army Corps of Engineers proposal to dump tons of contaminated sediment from 
Marina del Rey at a site in the Port of Los Angeles has received the unanimous 
backing of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent Monday to the California Coastal Commission, board Chairwoman 
Yvonne Braithwaite Burke urged the agency to allow the corps to remove about 
135,000 cubic yards of silt and sand tainted with lead and dozens of toxic 
substances from the Ballona Creek's runoff to deepen the marina's entrance 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission was scheduled to vote on the proposal at a hearing 
today in Eureka, but Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Councilman Rudy 
Svorinich Jr. have asked the commission to postpone its consideration so it can 
conduct the vote in the harbor area to make it easier for residents to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter Tuesday, the supervisors agreed to allow the county to 
indemnify the Port of Los Angeles for any problems caused by the transfer and 
deposit of the material. The county, in turn, would be indemnified by the 
corps, a federal agency, pending congressional approval, which could take up to 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Port officials had expressed concern about dumping the sediment at the harbor 
site because of its potential interruption of a massive $150-million expansion 
project that began Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said the buildup of silt at the marina's entrance, which is 
caused by the flow from Ballona Creek, has become a hazard for boats. In 
addition to the 6,000 pleasure craft that ply the area, officials are concerned 
about the operations of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Point Bridge, which would 
be used for rescues if a plane crashes at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 50% of both the north and south entrances have been closed to boating, 
and in some places off the jetty, depending on the tides, the water is three 
feet deep or less," said Jim Fawcett, the chief of planning for the County 
Department of Beaches and Harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, officials say, shoals have increased in the remaining boating 
lanes, and there is concern that severe winter storms, which increase the 
creek's sediment flow, could impede most navigation into or out of the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1960s, the corps has dredged the sediment in the marina, but now 
faces more stringent federal disposal rules. In 1990, the Environmental 
Protection Agency rejected a corps request to dump some of the buildup in the 
ocean six miles off the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, at the urging of county officials, the Coastal Commission 
reluctantly agreed to a "knockdown," a flattening of the bottom of the marina 
channel, as temporary relief.  
</P>
<P>
 With the shoals again high, the corps is asking for another stopgap measure. 
The federal agency wants to remove the marina's poisonous buildup, pack it in 
special plastic tubes and bury it in a shallow 185-acre wildlife area at the 
San Pedro harbor. The wildlife region will be created by the state as a 
mitigating factor to the port's "2020" project, which includes creating and 
deepening sea lanes, building several wharves, and dredging 23 million cubic 
yards of sediment -- some of which would go into the wildlife area. 
</P>
<P>
 But some environmentalists vehemently oppose the marina dredging plan. 
</P>
<P>
 They say the corps still lacks a long-term sediment management and disposal 
program and is using a federal fiscal deadline of Sept. 30, when it will lose 
$1.7 million that has been allocated to the project, to ram through the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've gone another two years, and we still have no plan. We're just back 
where we started," said Mark Gold, executive director of Heal the Bay, an 
environmental group. The corps plans to use $1.7 million in federal funds to 
pay for the project.

 Against the city attorney's advice, the Malibu City Council in 1991 adopted 
one of the state's strictest rent control laws, designed in part to protect 
tenants in the city's two mobile home parks from large rent increases and to 
correct alleged rent gouging. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, not only has a federal judge struck down several key provisions of the 
ordinance, including a rent rollback, but the owners of Malibu's two parks are 
suing the city for $3 million in back rent and other losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is one-third of our budget," said City Atty. Christi Hogin, who added 
that liability insurance would not cover the claim. If the damage suit goes to 
trial, and "if they are successful and we can't overturn it, then we'll pay it 
by cutting the Sheriff's (Department service), parks and recreation, and we'll 
stop filling in potholes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer ordered the city to 
stop enforcing provisions of the law that she had deemed unconstitutional, such 
as a rent rollback to 1984 base levels -- before such considerations as 
cost-of-living increases were figured in -- and a two-year rent freeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer also told the city to pay the legal fees of the owners of Paradise 
Cove and Point Dume Club and overturned portions of the law that barred owners 
from raising rents for three years when leases of more than one year expire. 
</P>
<P>
 Pfaelzer ruled that although the city had the right to protect low-income 
residents by limiting future rent increases, the city hadn't proved that the 
rents were too high or had been raised unfairly. The law, according to 
Pfaelzer, had prevented the park owners from getting a fair return on their 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 550 mobile homes in the two seaside parks, where lease spaces 
range from $200 to $1,500 a month, depending on ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
 The park owners' lawsuit to collect damages, filed in federal court in Los 
Angeles, is scheduled to be heard Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 The park owners will request about $1 million in attorneys' fees for the costs 
of state and federal lawsuits. A jury will decide on the dollar amount of 
damages. The Kissel Co., which owns Paradise Cove, will be asking for about 
$1.5 million in back rent, said Garrett L. Hanken, the company's attorney. The 
Adamson Cos., which owns Point Dume, will be asking for $300,000 to $600,000 in 
back payments, according to Tom Gibbs, the company's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The city hopes to avert a trial by settling out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 Hogin said the city decided to seek a settlement because of legal costs -- it 
has spent $400,000, making it the most costly litigation since the city 
incorporated three years ago -- and the belief that an appeal would not be 
successful. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the City Council voted 4 to 1 to approve a proposal that Hogin will 
present to the park owners next week. It suggests that owners be paid back rent 
in monthly installments over two years from tenants. Councilwoman Carolyn Van 
Horn dissented. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal, which has drawn mixed reaction from residents, also includes a 
promise to rezone the lower portion of Paradise Cove mobile home park for 
commercial use on the condition that the Kissel Co., the owner of the park, 
sells the upper section of the park to the residents, who have wanted to buy 
the park for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 About 97 trailers and mobile homes in the lower park would have to be 
relocated to other areas in Paradise Cove at the park owner's expense. That 
clause of the proposal has alarmed residents who would be directly affected by 
the rezoning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel like we're being used as sacrificial lambs to settle a lawsuit," said 
Andrea Sharp, who lives in the lower portion of the park and worries that there 
won't be enough room for all the coaches and trailers in other areas of 
Paradise Cove. "There is one couple who invested $140,000 in their mobile home 
two or three months ago, and then heard about this potential rezoning." 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruling was effective immediately, enabling park owners to adjust 
rents to the rates in effect as of March 28, 1991, when the City Council 
adopted a moratorium on mobile home park rent increases. An additional 75% of 
the consumer price index, or 3% a year, whichever is higher, will be added to 
1991 base-rent levels for each subsequent year until the present to calculate 
current rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Retiree Margaret Jacobs, who will pay $100 more a month for her lease in Point 
Dume, echoes the sentiment of many other seniors citizens who feel stuck: "The 
park has gone downhill in terms of amenities. We've been gouged. But we will 
pay it. My husband is 90 and can't be moved."

TROUBLED WATERS; DEVELOPMENT: PLANS TO BUILD AN APARTMENT COMPLEX NEAR AN 
ANCIENT SPRING HAVE CREATED A RIFT BETWEEN NATIVE AMERICANS AND 
ENVIRONMENTALISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The ancient waters that flow under and onto the grounds of University High 
School in West Los Angeles are no ordinary wellsprings. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally known as the Kuruvangna Springs, for hundreds of years the pools 
were an oasis for the first inhabitants of the Los Angeles basin, a Native 
American tribe called the Tongva. More recently, the once-sacred, now 
officially protected site has been put to more scenic uses -- the 22,000 
gallons of water that bubble up daily feed a waterfall and an 80-foot lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're a historic treasure for all of Los Angeles," said Brentwood resident 
Loretta Ditlow. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet that treasure may be in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 A 30-story apartment complex to be built at the nearby corner of Wilshire 
Boulevard and Barrington Avenue has some environmentalists worried that the 
underground springs may be destroyed by construction excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ditlow, vice president of the Gabrielino/Tongva Springs Foundation, is 
waging what some might say is a quixotic fight to halt the development. 
</P>
<P>
 The battle has been a complicated one. Two years ago, area residents believed 
they had triumphed when the construction of a hotel was blocked by the 
foundation, which leases the site from the Los Angeles Unified School District 
for $1 annually. And last May, after the developer, Barrington Plaza Ltd., had 
proposed to build apartments on the site, foundation members were further 
bolstered by a report from the city's Planning Department that recommended the 
project not be approved. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners said the environmental impact report prepared by Barrington Plaza 
failed to fully address the effect of construction on the springs and did not 
consider the protections afforded the pools by the state, which has declared it 
a historical site. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents' jubilation, however, was short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 The same day the report was released, the city Planning Commission overruled 
the department's decision and approved the development, citing the potential 
economic and social benefits. It now goes before the Planning and Land Use 
Management Commission and will eventually be considered by the City Council.  
</P>
<P>
 Among other advantages, the development is projected to generate 1,100 
construction and 97 non-construction jobs, as well as provide 335 "reasonably 
priced" apartments that could rent for as little as $700 per month. Barrington 
Plaza also intends to remodel portions of the three existing high-rises on the 
corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding weight to the developer's case was the unexpected support of the Tongva 
-- also known as Gabrielino, as the Spanish called them -- Tribal Council, 
which had earlier opposed the project. In a statement presented to the Planning 
Commission, tribal leaders said they were dropping their opposition because of 
Barrington Plaza's pledges not to dig deeper than areas already excavated for 
existing buildings, as well as its promises to hire two tribe members and an 
archeologist to monitor the construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We worked hard to listen carefully to the concerns of the tribal leadership," 
said Billie Greer, a Barrington Plaza spokeswoman. She added that, in deference 
to the tribe's wishes, instead of building four underground parking lots the 
developer agreed to build two. 
</P>
<P>
 Greer also said that quarterly reports will be made to the tribal council on 
the level of the ground water during construction. "We feel that all steps can 
and will be taken to ensure that there are no disturbances to the springs," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tongvas' official exit from its ranks has left the foundation, which 
includes Tongva members, in a precarious position: defending the sacred grounds 
of a tribe whose leaders don't want them defended. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Ditlow said the foundation's fight will continue until the project comes 
up for approval before the city's Planning and Land Use Management Commission 
next month. At the very least, she said, the foundation would like to have 
mitigating measures set up in case the development does disrupt the flow of 
water from the springs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone knows they're historical -- there's no dispute to the validity of 
these springs," said Ditlow, who describes herself as heartsick over the 
projected development. "They ought to be protected."

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Westside synagogue that is undergoing renovation of its main reception area, 
is adding facilities, and access for the disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Temple Beth Am, a 60-year-old synagogue on the Westside, will upgrade one of 
its sanctuary buildings with new kitchens, bathrooms, elevators and a front 
entrance, costing about $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In January the temple completed a $4-million, three-story school building. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Strick, financial administrator for the temple, said the renovation is 
expected to be completed in a year. The temple is still holding its regular 
services and events.

COMMUNITY NEWS: BEVERLY HILLS; COUNCIL REJECTS STRICT ANTI-SMOKING LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN STEINBERG 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council, heeding the concerns of restaurants and hotels, has backed 
away from restricting smoking in the city's 160 bars and restaurants as well as 
workplaces, portions of hotels and some outdoor areas. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 1 against passing a measure that would have been one of 
the strictest anti-smoking ordinances in California. 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to more than 30 people oppose the proposed law Tuesday night, 
a majority of the council agreed that the statewide tobacco control law, which 
takes effect Jan. 1, will be sufficient to provide health protection. The 
Beverly Hills ordinance was drafted last month because of concerns about the 
health risks of secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The state law will prohibit smoking in most enclosed indoor areas, including 
restaurants. But unlike Beverly Hills' proposal, it will not ban smoking in 
bars, hotel lobbies or banquet and conference rooms. The state law also does 
not require hotels to set aside 65% of guest rooms for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 By simply endorsing the state law and not passing one of their own, Beverly 
Hills council members said they were "leveling the playing field" by having the 
city's restaurants and hotels be regulated to the same extent as businesses 
statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult for me as mayor to step out and put the city at an economic 
disadvantage," said Beverly Hills Mayor Vicki Reynolds, acknowledging business 
owners' claims that customers would avoid Beverly Hills hotels and restaurants 
if the smoking laws were too strict. Neighboring cities Los Angeles, Santa 
Monica and West Hollywood prohibit smoking in restaurants, but not in bars or 
hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills Hotel general manager Kerman Beriker said the city risked losing 
$7 million in revenue from hotels because the ban would scare away European and 
Asian travelers, who are said to smoke more heavily than Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman MeraLee Goldman, who favored adopting the ordinance, said that 
although she was concerned with the problems of the business community, she had 
pledged in her 1994 election campaign to make the city smoke-free and protect 
residents from secondhand smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The five council members, all nonsmokers, also agreed to begin lobbying other 
Westside cities to unite and implement a regional ban that would be more 
stringent than the state law. 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills has been especially sensitive to the smoking issue. The city 
revoked a smoking ban in 1987 after restaurants claimed it was hurting 
business. SUSAN STEINBERG

COMMUNITY NEWS: HOLLYWOOD; EXPANSION BEGINS AT SHELTER FOR YOUTHS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORENZA MUNOZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Covenant House California, a shelter and counseling center for runaway youths, 
has begun the second phase of a $10-million project to expand and improve its 
facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Once completed, the new facilities, connected by an outdoor recreation area, 
will include 96 beds, a health clinic, employment assistance center, 
administrative offices and counseling center.Previously, a shelter was on 
Sunset Boulevard, and the administrative offices and health clinic were on 
Western Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Covenant House is demolishing the Western Avenue building for the two 
buildings, which will house all its operations. The first phase of the project, 
a building housing emergency beds, a food service area and program space, was 
recently completed. The second building, which will be a shelter, is expected 
to be completed within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Covenant House officials said the expansion would help accommodate the runaway 
youths using its services; last year, the number increased by 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase, said executive director Fred Ali, is due to young people who 
have left the foster care system without jobs or skills necessary to survive on 
their own. In addition, many people age 18 to 20 have fallen through the 
cracks: They are either too old or too young to receive help at most shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 But mainly, many runaway youths still believe their voyage to Hollywood will 
result in stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, Hollywood continues to be a Mecca for kids," Ali said, adding 
that about 40% of the kids who use Covenant House services are not from 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 The majority of the expansion funds have come from private sources, although 
$1 million is expected to come from the federal government. LORENZA MUNOZ

WESTSIDE / COVER STORY; PITCHING IN FOR THE PLANET; RECYCLING: OVERBURDENED 
LANDFILLS AND A STATE MANDATE TO REDUCE TRASH COULD CAUSE MORE WESTSIDE 
RESIDENTS TO CHANGE THEIR WAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Wait! Don't toss that bottle in the trash. Curbside recycling is about to hit 
most of the Westside, so you'll soon have a nice yellow recycling bin to stow 
it in instead. You will, really. 
</P>
<P>
 It's only a matter of weeks. OK, months, or maybe a year -- it all depends on 
where you live. But the city of Los Angeles is finally bringing the broad, 
garbage-rich swath of territory west of La Brea Avenue into its recycling 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 For residents of some areas this will be nothing new, since they have had 
curbside recycling for years. So have people in Santa Monica, West Hollywood, 
Beverly Hills, Culver City and Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the residents of 125,000 Los Angeles homes who are about to be 
included in the city's newly expanded recycling district, that environmentally 
responsible feeling is finally at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad to hear it because a lot of people tend not to bother," said Jim 
Witoszynski, a West Los Angeles resident who takes his recyclables to a 
drop-off station in Santa Monica once or twice a week. "So if they just have to 
put it in front of their house, then it's easy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials of Los Angeles and other Westside municipalities say they 
expect to meet or surpass a state-mandated goal of a 25% cut in the flow of 
solid waste by next year, the bad news is that another 25% in garbage savings 
will have to be achieved by the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting to 50% is the hard part," said Joan Edwards, director of the 
Integrated Solid Waste Management Office, which coordinates Los Angeles' 
recycling programs. The city of Los Angeles has already surpassed the 25% mark, 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only so much that individuals can do. Only about 15% of the trash 
from an average household can be recycled, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Any surplus of recyclables goes straight into a hole in the ground, and with 
landfills running out of room, it is unclear how much longer that will remain 
an option. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez Canyon, the landfill that serves the city of Los Angeles, is scheduled 
to close in 1996, although sanitation officials are trying to keep it open for 
another three years despite the opposition of residents in the northeast San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said extending its life to the year 2000 would save the city $72 
million over the cost of hauling the trash elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "People may be putting out less trash per person, but there are more people," 
said Bill George, recycling coordinator for the Los Angeles County Sanitation 
Districts. "We don't see this problem going away." 
</P>
<P>
 So any further improvement will have to come from mass changes of behavior 
summed up in the first two words of the state Integrated Waste Management 
Board's "Three R's" slogan: "Reduce, Reuse, Recycle." In short, a farewell to 
the throwaway society.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Change will not come easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the popularity of recycling and the downturn in the Southern 
California economy, "we're still getting a lot of trash because we are still 
pretty much a disposable society," said Kimberly Collins, project manager for 
Malibu's Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Research has found that Americans create more waste than any other nation, 
averaging half a ton per person per year -- 3.5 pounds per day. Californians 
are said to be generating more than twice as much as the average. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real secret is the next generation," said Joan Satt, waste-reduction 
coordinator for Culver City. She cited the case of a man who called to ask 
about recycling after his 4-year-old daughter came home from preschool talking 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as parents stopped smoking when their children pressured them into it 
because they learned in school that tobacco kills, so, too, will the children 
lead us into less wasteful ways," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until those tykes grow up, however, it will be up to the rest of us to find a 
way to come to terms with the problems of waste in a land of abundance. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the Westside, cities have found their own paths, and now Los Angeles is 
about to take major strides to step up its recycling program after a two-year 
delay caused by problems with staffing, equipment and finding a site for a 
sorting station, known in the trade as a Materials Recovery Facility, or MRF. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For now, most of the area's recyclables will go to a plant in an industrial 
zone near Downtown and the rest will go to a facility in the West Valley. That 
led Valley Councilwoman Laura Chick to voice concerns earlier this year about 
air pollution from 150 truckloads a week of Westside waste. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, officials said that they are negotiating with several operators 
to find one that would run a Westside MRF to be located in an industrial area 
near Robertson and Venice boulevards in Palms. Officials hope the plant will be 
operating by next year. 
</P>
<P>
 When the latest expansion of curbside recycling is completed sometime next 
summer, the service will be available to 720,000 residences and businesses 
citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, paper accounts for the biggest share -- about 30% -- of the 
waste stream,followed by yard scraps at 13%, food waste 11%, plastics 7%, and 
other categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Most apartment buildings are served by private trash haulers, so they will not 
be part of the program; those served by the city's garbage trucks will be 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 As the residential program is expanded, each household will be issued a yellow 
14-gallon bin for recycling everything but paper -- metal and aluminum cans, 
glass bottles and jars and plastic bottles. For now, no milk cartons and no 
tubs such as those used for cottage cheese and margarine will be collected 
because they are impractical to recycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents will be asked to put discards such as magazines, newspapers, 
corrugated cardboard or paper bags next to the yellow bins. 
</P>
<P>
 "It happens on the same day as the regular trash collection, so there's 
nothing you have to remember except to put it out," said Gyl Elliott, public 
information director for the city Bureau of Sanitation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sanitation officials said they have received hundreds of calls from residents 
concerned about scavengers. Last Friday, the Board of Public Works approved a 
proposal to form a three-member team to crack down on organized rings that 
routinely raid the yellow bins. The proposal now goes before the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 A law makes scavenging a misdemeanor punishable by a $500 fine or six months 
in jail, but authorities said they didn't know if anyone had ever been 
prosecuted under it. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not so much the loss of recyclables that bothers city officials as the 
fear that residents will not bother with recycling if they see the proceeds 
going into private hands. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be 60-gallon green containers for garden waste, which is composted, 
mixed with sewer sludge and sold as fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 The third container will be a 60-gallon black container whose contents go to 
the dump; it holds the equivalent of three or four regular trash cans -- 
probably too much for many households. 
</P>
<P>
 "They determined in 1988 that that was the average size needed, but what they 
didn't realize was how much we'd be recycling by now," Elliott said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trash flow from the West Valley, for example, is already down 40% from 
what it was in 1990, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We challenge the West Los Angeles area to go even higher," Elliott said. 
"It's reasonable because people have been waiting for it for years, and the 
only reason we didn't go there was because there was no place to take the 
material." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the initial solid-waste reduction was measured at no more than 3% 
when the program began elsewhere in the city five years ago, Elliott said the 
inclusion of garden waste has made a big difference, representing almost a 
third of what the average person puts out a week. 
</P>
<P>
 She said chronic breakdowns of hydraulic equipment on automatic-loading trucks 
have been resolved since 1992, when city officials acknowledged that unforeseen 
problems had blocked expansion of the program. It was initially to have been in 
place citywide by September, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 A hiring freeze was also relaxed, allowing for the employment of new truck 
drivers. 
</P>
<P>
 The efforts by Los Angeles and other local municipalities are part of a 
statewide drive that has reduced the solid waste stream by 20% since 1990, 
according to estimates by the California Integrated Waste Management Board. The 
latest projection shows the goal of a 25% cutback will be attained by the end 
of next year. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now 480 communities in the state with curbside recycling programs, 
almost twice as many as in 1990, and each one has come up with its own way of 
responding to the challenge of drastically reducing the flow of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Culver City, residents buy special blue bags for up to $2.25 at the grocery 
store to hold their recyclables before sending them off with the rest of the 
garbage for sorting at a transfer station. 
</P>
<P>
 There, crews of young people from the Exceptional Children's Foundation fish 
the bags out of the rest of the trash and pile them up for removal to a 
commercial recycling plant for sorting and resale. 
</P>
<P>
 With an estimated 43% of households taking advantage of the program, about 23% 
of Culver City's trash goes to the recycling plant, a figure that officials 
hope to boost in coming months through public education and a restructuring of 
fees to make it more economical for businesses to sort out their recyclable 
waste. 
</P>
<P>
 The city gets a monthly check from the recycling plant, but it does not come 
close to paying for the cost of the collection program, which is underwritten 
by an $18.59 monthly charge to homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very few recycling programs make money," noted Joseph Delaney, solid-waste 
superintendent for Beverly Hills. "Some can break even when we include the 
money saved by not having to send waste to landfills -- the cost of disposing a 
ton of waste in a landfill is triple what it was 10 years ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills residents share recycling bins distributed in the city's 
numerous alleys; homes without alleys are issued blue bags for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Having cut its garbage flow by about 15%, the city is hoping to reach next 
year's goal of 25% by diverting garden waste from the landfill for use as mulch 
or compost, and by expanding the recycling program to include businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 West Hollywood this year granted an exclusive franchise to a company that took 
the place of several small trash haulers and promised to pay any state-imposed 
fines if the goals for 1995 and 2000 are not met. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is underwritten by fees paid directly by property owners to the 
recycling and hauling firm, which pays a new 10% franchise fee to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pulled some cash from the trash," said David M. Hare, environmental 
services and operations manager for the city. Under the old system, he said, 
"we found that a lot of people were being overcharged for trash despite the 
competition." 
</P>
<P>
 In Santa Monica, bins are issued to single-family homes and other small 
buildings, while apartment dwellers are encouraged to drop off their 
recyclables in bigger containers at about 100 locations throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city also recycles asphalt and old toilets, distributes home composting 
bins to residents at low cost and picks up mixed waste paper: catalogues, 
magazines, phone books, office paper, junk mail, cereal boxes and milk cartons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We structure it such that the city runs the collection program and it's 
funded out of solid-waste payments on the refuse-collection bill every two 
months," said Jon Root, waste-reduction coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen a residential program that's been able to pay its way 
strictly on the value of the recyclables, Root said." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In Malibu, the big problem is green waste, said Collins, project manager for 
the new city's public works department. 
</P>
<P>
 A residential recycling program began last year and a commercial program was 
initiated this summer, "but with Malibu we have more gardeners than anything 
else, so we need a place for them to take the stuff," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the progress toward recycling goals, things are not entirely rosy. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only nine major landfills serving Los Angeles County, down from 13 a 
decade ago, and officials see no drop in demand for space in the dumps. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of uncertainty here," said Don S. Nellor, head of solid-waste 
planning for the Los Angeles County Sanitation Districts. "A large metropolitan 
area like Los Angeles County is more than likely always going to find itself on 
the verge of a crisis when it comes to providing adequate disposal capacity." 
How They're Doing 
</P>
<P>
 Although details of the program vary from city to city, Westside residents who 
are not already able to take advantage of curbside recycling for cans, bottles, 
paper and garden waste should be able to do so by this time next year. 
Municipalities have to meet a goal of reducing all of their solid waste by 
one-quarter by 1995. They must reduce it another 25% by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 * LOS ANGELES exceeded its goal of a 25% reduction in solid waste flow, 
compared to 1990 levels, officials say; a survey is being contemplated for next 
year to see if the percentage will have reached the mid-30s as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 * SANTA MONICA has reduced the amount of garbage sent to landfills by 15% to 
17% overall; the reduction in the residential sector has been measured at 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 * CULVER CITY's garbage-reduction rate is estimated at 23%. 
</P>
<P>
 * WEST HOLLYWOOD has reduced its flow by 18%; once businesses are brought into 
the program, the figure is expected to rise to 35%.  
</P>
<P>
 * MALIBU has cut its flow by 17%. 
</P>
<P>
 * BEVERLY HILLS is at 14% to 15%; an increase is expected once a plan to 
include businesses is approved.

REGIONAL REPORT; SOUTH BAY; PANEL URGES SENIOR HOUSING ON SURPLUS NAVAL 
PROPERTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Housing for senior citizens will be built on 27 acres of surplus Navy property 
in San Pedro if a local group of residents gets its way. 
</P>
<P>
 In a document released last week, the San Pedro Area Reuse Committee said 
senior housing is the best use of the land at Taper Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents the harbor district, 
appointed the committee earlier this year to look at options for military land 
left vacant in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has been concentrating on the Taper Avenue site, which has been 
at the center of community debate and concern since it was announced in January 
that its 144 housing units would be used for up to 880 homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials approved an application by Turner's Technical Institute 
Inc., a South-Central homeless advocacy organization, to run the homeless 
shelter after the Long Beach Naval Station closes this month.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee plan for senior housing assumes that Turner's plan will be 
derailed, secretary Jerry Gaines said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wish list," Gaines said. "It hasn't been cleared up yet as to 
whether or not federal screening is finished. But the senior housing use would 
be most preferred by the community, particularly those around the property." 
</P>
<P>
 The report also says a smaller homeless shelter run by local organizations 
could be viable. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Theus, Turner's spokesman, said the institute would consider working 
with the San Pedro groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it would have to be a program for homeless people," Theus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the alternatives are, but I do know that (Turner's) is 
going ahead every day to get closer and closer to what we need to make that 
program work." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the committee's plan, the housing would include affordable houses, 
assisted living, a nursing home, geriatric day care, a recreation center, open 
space and walking trails. Outreach programs also would operate from the 
complex.  
</P>
<P>
 The report says the number of senior citizens in the San Pedro/Wilmington area 
living in poverty increased 26% between 1980 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The report says the need, feasibility and community support for Turner's 
proposal is low.  
</P>
<P>
 However, it suggests other options for the site, including affordable housing, 
single-family residences, a police special training facility, public 
recreation, a nature preserve, an educational facility and Air Force housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations will be discussed at a public hearing Sept. 29, at 7 p.m. 
in Peck Park Auditorium, 560 N. Western Ave., San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the federal department of Health and Human Services is 
reviewing the homeless shelter plan by Turner's Institute in light of strong 
community and political opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) has urged department Secretary Donna E. 
Shalala to reopen applications because the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development recently disqualified 60% of the Taper Avenue housing for homeless 
use because of its proximity to aviation fuel tanks.  
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials have not informed Theus that some of the Taper Avenue 
property is no longer suitable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaines said the senior citizen housing could be built outside the danger zone 
from the tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's application for the shelter was approved under the Stewart B. 
McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. The legislation gives homeless 
providers first priority for surplus federal land. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal representatives including Harman, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Doug 
Bereuter (R-Nebraska) have been working on amendments to the McKinney Act and 
other federal legislation where it affects military property.

OUT AND ABOUT / AUNT BEE'S: WASH AND WEAR THE MAYBERRY WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINA V. GODBEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Aunt Bee's is a shop with a big heart. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, it looks like any other thrift shop: racks of shirts, pants, 
dresses and sport coats. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind the neatly divided sections of clothing, there is a room with three 
washing machines, three dryers and a huge folding table. This is where laundry 
is washed, fluffed, folded and returned free of charge to homebound people in 
the Hollywood area with AIDS. Revenues from the store help to finance the 
laundry service, which has about 170 clients. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift shop's stock and selection vary. In a given month, as many as 6,000 
items are sold. The store prides itself on selling quality items, many in 
nearly new condition, and include brand-name and designer labels. Donations 
come from a number of sources, including the wardrobe department at Sony 
Pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 Most items cost $2.99 or less, with dresses priced around $10 and men's jeans 
ranging from $7.99 to $12.99. On some days, there is a 49-cent T-shirt rack. 
</P>
<P>
 After two years of fund raising, co-founder Micki Jackson and Morris Kight 
opened Aunt Bee's, named in honor of the television character on the "Andy 
Griffith Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Using donated equipment, the store has worked to improve and increase its 
laundry services. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a simple project," Jackson said. "It's a lot of work. . . . We don't 
push papers around all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said the idea for the project came after a visit to Auntie Helen's 
Fluff and Fold in San Diego, a thrift store and laundry service for AIDS 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson said she has also cared for many friends with AIDS and spent a lot of 
time doing loads of laundry. The former graphic artist felt that she could make 
an impact in the community by offering such a service in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get up every day and I'm eager to get started," said the longtime Los 
Angeles resident. "It feels very good to know that you are being useful." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the thrift store and laundry service, Aunt Bee's donates 
articles of clothing to local organizations for the homeless. The store is also 
happy to accept donations such as shoes, clothing, accessories and linens as 
well as laundry soap and non-chlorinated bleach. 
</P>
<P>
 Aunt Bee's, 6124 Santa Monica Blvd., Hollywood. Open 11 a.m. to 6 p.m. daily.

 AUDIBLE 
</P>
<P>
 After replacing Tom Strickland as St. Bernard High football coach in August, 
1993, Mike Noonan promised he would not make any dramatic changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quick turnover in coaches was not that dramatic," Noonan said shortly 
after becoming coach. "We're not going to change uniforms or the nickname of 
the school. One or two plays may be different." 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan, however, did make one dramatic change this season. 
</P>
<P>
 He resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 6, three days before the start of the season, Noonan quit as Vikings 
coach and history teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his home, Noonan said: "We had a breaking of the waves. There's no 
story in it. It's something I don't want to comment about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry it didn't work out there. It's a good group of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Yarnall, the Vikings' baseball coach, and Tom Burgess will run the team as 
co-coaches. Both have football coaching experience. Assistant James Swain will 
do the play-calling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mystery to me why he left," Swain said. "But he did a nice job while 
he was here." 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan, who took the Vikings to the Southern Section playoffs, became the 
second coach to leave abruptly. Noonan's predecessor, Strickland, left for 
personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Bernard lost its opener, 26-12, to Culver City. The Vikings led, 6-0, on a 
16-yard touchdown pass from quarterback Brandon Pernell to receiver Jason 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Pernell and Smith were two of the most outspoken players after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody was mad at coach Noonan for leaving," Pernell said. "He just walked 
out. We felt the season was over. What were we going to do Friday?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't expecting (his resignation). Last year when it happened with 
Strickland, it was during the summer. But three days before game. . . . It 
disrupted everything we prepared for," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith and Pernell said that Noonan had been pressured by St. Bernard 
administrators, specifically Athletic Director Jim McClune, during practice to 
submit forms regarding player eligibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Noonan declined comment. UPSET SPECIAL 
</P>
<P>
 When Norm Lacy took over as St. Monica football coach in 1991, he fought to 
get wins. This season, he is fighting for respect. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners got both after a stunning 25-6 victory against Westchester on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an awful big win for us," Lacy said. "People consider us a small 
parochial school which can't play quality football. To get respect, you have to 
play and beat a quality football team." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners needed to control the ball to prevent the faster Comets from 
scoring any breakaway touchdowns. They ran 62 offensive plays compared to 31 
for the Comets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did the best we could to keep the ball out of their hands," Lacy said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mike Bailey forced a fumble at the Mariners' two-yard line, St. Monica 
drove 98 yards and scored on Steve Pulley's quarterback sneak. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulley, who played his first game at quarterback, also scored on a one-yard 
run. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners also benefited from interceptions by Carlos Casillas and Dwight 
Carter. HALTING A STREAK 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood High ended a 19-game losing streak with a 20-16 victory against Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sheiks have not won a game since a 24-12 victory against St. Genevieve in 
the 1992 season opener. It was Coach Bob O'Conner's first and only win at 
Hollywood until last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a team play with so much intensity in the first game," said 
O'Conner, who has coached football for 41 years. "I have some mixed emotions 
because I went to Los Angeles. But we needed a win." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood quarterback Nguhra "Nuggy" Agungscored two touchdowns on quarterback 
sneaks. YOUNG VETERANS 
</P>
<P>
 Venice High coaches Tony Chretin and Kirk Alexander feared the worst when they 
lined up a football squad of mostly sophomores and juniors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expected typical first-game jitters," Chretin said. "Off-side penalties 
and other mental mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the Gondoliers played like a veteran team in shutting out 
Huntington Park, 14-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Venice (1-0) took advantage of two Huntington Park turnovers and were 
penalized only three times for 15 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Linebacker Gerardo Gomez had 10 unassisted tackles and two quarterback sacks. 
Safety Tony Gomez had an interception and a fumble recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Ronnel Jamar and Demetrius Posey each scored on 15-yard runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a team we knew little about," Chretin said. "We kept things pretty 
basic and it worked out." PAYING THE PRICE 
</P>
<P>
 Palisades Coach Russ Howard has had trouble getting his players to practice. 
The Dolphins paid dearly during Friday's 31-13 loss to Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had all 11 players on offense or all 11 players on defense together 
for practice," Howard said, whose team has 40 players bused to school. "Our 
defense, especially the defensive line, got killed. They ran counters and 
sweeps and the entire sidelines were left open. Our linebackers were terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, linebacker Sheldon Smith left the game with a separated 
left shoulder and offensive lineman Cesar Alvarez did not play because of a 
laceration on his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dolphins have an off week before playing host to Gardena Sept. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 By then Howard expects to have his squad in order. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got rid of the guys who didn't want to make a commitment to the team," he 
said. NEW TRACK COACH 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime track coach Claudius Shropshire has been hired to run the men's 
cross-country and men's track and field programs at West L.A. College, the 
school announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Shropshire coached the men's cross-country team and men's track 
and field team at Santa Monica College and has been working with those programs 
as an assistant or head coach since 1985. His part-time teaching and coaching 
position at Santa Monica was recently eliminated because of budgetary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Shropshire, 42, began his coaching career at Jordan in 1975 where he worked 
with Olympic gold medalist Florence Griffith Joyner. He also has coached at 
Gardena High (1980-84) and Cal State Dominguez Hills (1983). JC FOOTBALL 
</P>
<P>
 West Los Angeles College hopes to cut down on mistakes and find a quarterback 
when the Oilers play host to Valley College at 1 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers showed their inexperience last week in a 38-0 loss to Ventura 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 West L.A., which has 40 freshmen on its 54-player squad, had seven fumbles, 
three interceptions and was penalized 10 times for 75 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers used three quarterbacks and each struggled. Albert Saldana 
completed three of eight passes for 71 yards and had three interceptions. Ron 
Peebles replaced Saldana and connected on six of 14 attempts for 76 yards. 
Ennis Powell finished up, completing three of seven passes for 41 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 All-American running back Michael Black gained only 68 yards in 20 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica College opens its football season at 3 p.m. Saturday at Rio 
Hondo. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Taylor makes his debut as the school's first black football coach. He 
replaced Owen Hahn last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corsairs' strength is at quarterback with Jorge Blanco, who has improved 
his fundamentals and his conditioning during the off-season. John Houston, an 
all-City Section 4-A Division player at Carson, and former Venice standout 
Robert Hayes give the Corsairs speed in the backfield. Offensive line and 
linebackers are also a strong point. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corsairs were 3-6-1 last season. SEAN WATERS

KID STUFF: TRAIN REACTIONS; LOCAL AFICIONADOS PRESENT A MODEL MEET THAT 
PROMISES FUN ON A GRAND SCALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Orange County Edition.

<P>
 What is it with kids and trains? From Thomas the Tank Engine to the Little 
Engine That Could, trains transcend the ranks of mere transportation to become 
rolling symbols of fortitude, courage and all-around pluck. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents aren't immune to this either, often hooking up with their children's 
train mania without a backward glance. We read train stories at bedtime; we 
labor mightily (and curse discreetly) over model train layouts. And, muscle 
cramps be damned, we even fold ourselves into Lilliputian theme-park trains to 
catch the glow of our kids' faces as they ride the rails. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday and Sunday, the Orange County Model Engineers will let visitors 
indulge their taste for trains at no cost -- that is, if you don't count the 
parents' chiropractic bills. From 10 a.m. to 3:30 p.m., about 35 miniature 
trains from across the country will rumble over the Mackerel Flats and Goat 
Hill Junction Railroad in Costa Mesa's Fairview Park in the model engineers' 
annual train meet.  
</P>
<P>
 Admission is free, and visitors may ride any of the operating trains as often 
as they like at no charge. Donations, however, to the nonprofit group will be 
accepted. Vendors will sell train-themed souvenirs and collectibles, and 
picnicking is encouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 Train owners and enthusiasts from as far as Florida, along with many of the 90 
men, women and children who belong to Orange County Model Engineers, will be on 
hand to drive the trains and discuss their hobby, according to member Bob 
Donnelly of Costa Mesa. There are roughly 1,500 model engineer clubs 
nationwide, including groups in Riverside, Los Angeles and Chula Vista. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County group offers free train rides every third Saturday and 
Sunday at the Costa Mesa park, typically attracting 2,500 or more visitors in a 
weekend. Club members also put on tours and rides for birthday, community and 
school groups -- generally for a small fee to cover insurance costs. This 
weekend, the group will designate some unsuspecting passenger as their 
100,000th rider and award him or her with an engineer's cap, a train whistle 
and a private train ride. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is to perpetuate (interest in) trains," Donnelly explained. 
"Everybody loves trains; people knock themselves out setting them up under the 
Christmas tree for one week a year. Here, they can sit back and enjoy that on a 
grander scale." 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the annual train meet will ride in open-air passenger cars pulled 
by engines built to one-eighth scale, said Donnelly, who recently retired from 
Disneyland's security department. Most are diesel fueled, but several steam and 
electric engines are expected to be on hand. Many of the privately owned 
vehicles were purchased fully assembled or built from kits, Donnelly said, 
adding that visitors will also see trains that were hand-built by master 
craftsmen. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the guys just design and build their own. One fellow from Holland was 
back there a few years ago and was impressed with an electric train he saw in 
France. He got the plans and downscaled them and built one himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Passenger cars typically seat three to five people (for safety reasons, 
children under the age of 1 and pregnant women are not allowed to ride). Each 
engine can also pull freight cars. A cattle car constructed by one local member 
boasts a small plastic herd and, for an added touch of authenticity, 
tape-recorded moos. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated on 45 acres of parkland that the model engineers lease from the city 
for $1 per year, the Mackerel Flats and Goat Hill Junction Railroad is one of 
the largest layouts of its kind in Southern California, Donnelly said. In five 
years, the railroad has grown from 700 feet of aluminum track laid 7 1/2 inches 
apart ("we run on recycled beer cans," Donnelly joked) to a 2 1/2-mile course 
that offers riders views of Huntington Beach, Fountain Valley and, much to the 
chagrin of some golfers, Costa Mesa Golf and Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a guy is teeing up, and one of our engineers blows the whistle . . . 
whooo, look out!" Donnelly said, laughing. Miffed golfers have been known to 
"accidentally" hit a practice shot in the track's direction, he added, "but 
never when the public's around." 
</P>
<P>
 The whistle-blowing isn't just for atmosphere's sake. Train operators, 
whizzing along at 7 m.p.h., follow the same rules and regulations as the staff 
of a full-size railroad; hence, whistles must be blown every time a train goes 
over or under the railroad's 93-foot trestle bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mackerel Flats and Goat Hill Junction Railroad has much of the same 
equipment that might be found in a full-size yard, including a turntable and a 
hydraulic hoist for lifting cars. 
</P>
<P>
 A large portion of the layout was built from castoff materials. Many platforms 
and walkways were built with concrete left over from the John Wayne Airport 
expansion. Used water tanks for the station's tower were contributed by 
American Airlines, and railroad ties are built from Home Depot's castoff lumber 
soaked in motor oil from local car dealers and garages. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the group's clubhouse is recycled. In its former life, it was a shed in 
the city's maintenance yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Members want to add another 10,000 feet of track, making the railroad the 
largest of its kind to haul the public in the United States, Donnelly said. 
Budgetary considerations may delay the expansion, but that slower pace is just 
fine with Donnelly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just want the public to hopefully learn a little bit about trains and then 
sit back and have a good time. You need that these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like we tell a lot of the kids, 'The West wasn't settled with 747s.' " 
</P>

SPOTLIGHT; TAMING THE ANIMAL; ROD STEIGER HAS BATTLED MENTAL ILLNESS; NOW HE'S 
FIGHTING ITS STIGMA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, Jan Herman covers theater for The Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sitting in the living room of his home, which is perched on a mountainside in 
Malibu, Rod Steiger has his back to a panoramic view of Paradise Cove far 
below. His hand rests on a white telephone. He picks it up on the first ring. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who? Yeah. Who? Yeah. OK. I'll tell her to call you." 
</P>
<P>
 About to hang up, he changes his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait a minute." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiger shifts his stout body, comfortably ensconced in the cushions of a huge 
armchair, and bellows toward the other end of the house: "Paula?" 
</P>
<P>
 Silence. 
</P>
<P>
 "She might have gone in the pool with the baby," he says, speaking into the 
phone again. "Call her back in 15 minutes.' 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later the door opens in a book-lined wall of the living room. 
Steiger's fourth wife, Paula, enters wearing a bathing suit partly covered by a 
beach towel. Their 18-month-old son squirms out of her arms and makes a beeline 
for his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my boy," the 69-year-old actor says, beaming at a sturdy, round-faced 
tyke who is his spitting image. "Michael Winston. Michael for Michelangelo, 
Winston for Churchill, and Steiger because I happened to be around." 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had a crash and burn in the pool," Paula says. "He jumped in and 
smashed my lip." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiger is all solicitude, happy for the assurance that neither of them has 
sustained major damage. His family life seems idyllic. Paula's split lip 
notwithstanding, it is the very picture of domestic bliss. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't always so. For almost a decade after a heart-bypass operation in 
1979, the aging Hollywood star lived on the edge of a mental abyss, driven by 
despair to more than one suicide attempt.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite fame, wealth, three Oscar nominations, one Oscar and a reputation as 
an actor's actor, he dwindled into a sullen ghost of himself. And his career 
soured too. His classic performances in "On the Waterfront," "The Pawnbroker" 
and "In the Heat of the Night" were nothing more than faint memories even to 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suffer from clinical depression," he says, when wife and son have gone. "It 
comes from a chemical imbalance in the brain. Nobody except Paula wants me to 
talk about it. My present manager and my agent both say, 'If you talk about 
your depression, people will think you're crazy.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Steiger pauses and rivets his visitor with an intense stare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have experienced the pain. I have experienced the embarrassment, the 
peculiar looks, the whispered words that I can hear before they're whispered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen people institutionalized. I tried to put myself away, but (Paula) 
wouldn't let me. I tried to kill myself a couple of times, but she saved me. 
</P>
<P>
 "So when I'm not working, I try to fight the stigma against mental disease. 
It's much more important for me to talk about depression and what it can do to 
a person than talk about the movies I've made." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, to raise funds for the Brain Imaging Center at UC Irvine, he will 
discuss his life and career Saturday at 8 p.m. in "An Evening With Rod Steiger" 
at the Irvine Barclay Theatre. The show will feature excerpts from his roughly 
80 movies, as well as an on-stage interview with Richard Brown, host of the 
American Movie Classics cable TV program "Reflections on the Silver Screen."  
</P>
<P>
 Steiger, who has been able to control his illness with daily medication, 
recalls that in the depth of his depression he refused to speak, wash or eat 
and spent endless days unable to do anything but gaze out his window at the 
ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a zombie," he says, looking tan and healthy in a black T-shirt and 
shorts. "But there's a part of depression that nobody talks about. You get very 
hostile. You get thoughts like shooting your loved ones and yourself. That 
happened to me. And that is scary. 
</P>
<P>
 "One smart thing I did, I called a friend to take away a shotgun I had. Then I 
locked myself in a room downstairs. For three days I tore the walls. I tore 
myself up. I bit myself. People forget we are the highest form of animal. 
A-n-i- m-a-l. The animal can take over and destroy." 
</P>
<P>
 Steiger never fails to acknowledge his wife's role in coping with his illness. 
They met at a Beverly Hills banquet in 1980, when she was a 20-year-old club 
singer, and lived together for five years before marrying in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 (He's also the first to point out that his wife is a year younger than his 
daughter, the opera singer Anna Steiger, whose mother, the British-born actress 
Claire Bloom, was his second wife. Anna is pursuing a London-based opera career 
in Europe.) 
</P>
<P>
 Steiger's candor is not new. Since his recovery during the late '80s, he's 
been on a "personal campaign" to focus public attention on mental illness. As 
an out-of-the-closet celebrity speaking for the National Institute of Mental 
Health, he testified last year before a Senate panel and read a poem, "Hitting 
the Bottom," that went on for six pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the time I finished," says Steiger, who has written poetry all his life, 
"the whole panel was in tears. (Edward) Kennedy was crying, (Orrin) Hatch was 
wiping his eyes, and (Strom) Thurmond was blowing his nose." 
</P>
<P>
 But the real payoff, he notes, was the roughly $24 million that went to 
mental-health research as a result of the hearings.  
</P>
<P>
 When Steiger puts his life and career under the spotlight at the Irvine 
theater, he undoubtedly will have a lot to say about a lot of subjects. Here's 
some of what he said in answer to his visitor's questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * On his relationship with Marlon Brando in "On the Waterfront":  
</P>
<P>
 I didn't get to know Brando. He was very withdrawn. He may not like me, but 
I'm not particularly fond of him either. 
</P>
<P>
 I think there was a little animosity between us because all of a sudden, to 
Kazan's delight, here were the two young bulls who were being talked about. 
</P>
<P>
 Brando, of course, had been magnificent in "A Streetcar Named Desire." And 
here was this other kid, me, who was supposed to be pretty good. I think Kazan 
couldn't wait to see us do a scene together and kill each other to be the 
better one. 
</P>
<P>
 I guess the proof of the pudding came out in the taxi scene. I don't know who 
was better or worse -- that's just something for the sake of conversation -- 
but we both worked together pretty well, I think. 
</P>
<P>
 Brando wasn't there for my close-ups. He went home. But I don't want to get 
into that. That's all worn out. 
</P>
<P>
 I respected his talent. I couldn't wait for us to act together again, to 
challenge each other. But we never did, which goes to show the intellectual 
stupidity of (Hollywood), or its so-called intelligence, anyway. If I were a 
producer in those days and saw these two kids in the back of that cab, I would 
have said, get them another script for another movie by tomorrow morning. 
They'll kill each other to be good. 
</P>
<P>
 * On that classic taxicab scene, which Brando claims in his new autobiography 
("Marlon Brando: Songs My Mother Taught Me") was improvised: 
</P>
<P>
 That scene is almost exactly the way it was written. We shot it in a room that 
had to be 12 feet by 20 feet if it was an inch. We had half a cab with a 
steering wheel, the back seat, the two side windows and a back window. If you 
stuck your hand out to the left you touched a wall. If you stuck it out to the 
right and extended your finger you touched a wall.  
</P>
<P>
 The space was so small it forced the camera to come in closer and closer on 
us. If it didn't, you could have seen the walls. They were going crazy not to 
see them. With all this madness going on, everybody was up . We were in a 
pickle, and that forced Kazan to depend on his actors. 
</P>
<P>
 When I came in, Kazan was screaming at Sam Spiegel, the producer, "Where's my 
backdrop? I have to have a backdrop to show the cab is moving!" He was talking 
about a rear projection to show the cab is out on the street. So somebody says, 
"When I came to work in a cab, it had a Venetian blind in the back window." 
Kazan says, "Get me a f------ Venetian blind." So that's why there's that 
Venetian blind back there. 
</P>
<P>
 * On not winning the best-actor Oscar for "The Pawnbroker": 
</P>
<P>
 I was sure I was going to win. I was sitting behind Lee Marvin figuring, 
"Should I jump up or walk slow? Should I kiss that beautiful woman over there 
or say hello to this big producer over here?" I was so cocky about it that I 
kind of buttoned my jacket and was halfway out of my seat when they said, "Lee 
Marvin for 'Cat Ballou.' " I couldn't believe my ears. This may sound 
egotistical, but today when I look back at that picture, I wonder, How could 
they have done it?  
</P>
<P>
 * On winning the best-actor Oscar for "In the Heat of the Night": 
</P>
<P>
 They gave it to me out of guilt. But I think I earned it. 
</P>
<P>
 * On portraying the bigoted sheriff in that picture: 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest challenge was the chewing gum. It was in the script that this 
sheriff is always chewing gum. I said to Norman (Jewison, the director), "Come 
on. That's the biggest cliche in the world." I said, "I'll do anything you 
want. But that chewing gum has got to go." He says, "Please try it." Now it 
became a challenge. Well, the only way to take a cliche and make it work is to 
make it your own , make it part of your behavior so it belongs to you. 
</P>
<P>
 When you're an actor and you have to wear a jacket everybody else is wearing, 
what do you do? You clip the collar short, and all of a sudden it's not a 
cliche.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, we were rehearsing, and I noticed that when I got excited I was 
chewing fast. I thought, "Wait a minute. I can let the audience know how I'm 
feeling with this chewing gum." Bang! I'm out of the cliche. I think, "When 
this guy chews fast, you know he's upset. When he slows down, you know he's 
thinking. And when he stops chewing, you don't know what the hell he's going to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 * On the importance of winning an Oscar: 
</P>
<P>
 When they give you the Academy Award, you're the most important actor in the 
world for about 10 seconds, the time it takes to get the award and go 
backstage. Then you're looking for a job again. Your price goes up -- that's 
all -- until you make your first mistake, which means doing a picture that 
doesn't make money. 
</P>
<P>
 * On his biggest mistake: 
</P>
<P>
 Turning down "Patton" was my biggest business mistake. What happened was, I 
had won the Academy Award and I was on top of the world. When they sent me the 
script of "Patton," I said, "Oh, no. Not me. I'm not going to glorify war." I 
always thought I was a pacifist. Ten years later, when I needed to put some 
money in the bank, or when I was sick and tired of it all, I would have done 
"Patton" in a shot. But at that time, I was in good shape. I had no problems 
monetarily. So I could afford to luxuriate in my phony philosophy.  
</P>
<P>
 * On acting: 
</P>
<P>
 Good acting is like good lovemaking. Leave yourself alone and explore. Do it. 
Don't watch yourself do it. Don't think about yourself doing it. You just go 
from moment to moment. But don't take anything for granted either, especially 
not in acting. That's when you get your ass kicked. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: "An Evening With Rod Steiger."  
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturday, Sept. 17, at 8 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 * Where: Irvine Barclay Theatre, 4242 Campus Drive, Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Take the San Diego (405) Freeway to the Jamboree Road exit and 
head south. Turn left onto Campus Drive. The theater is on Campus near Bridge 
Road, across from the Marketplace mall.  
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: $25 for show; $100 includes dinner. Proceeds benefit brain 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 740-2000, Ticketmaster. Path of a Bright Career 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Westhampton, N.Y., on April 14, 1925, Rod Steiger grew up in Newark, 
N.J. He joined the Navy at 16 and served in the Pacific during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 After the war, he studied acting in New York. His first taste of national fame 
came in 1953 when he was cast as Marty, the lonely Bronx butcher, in the 
original Goodyear Playhouse telecast of Paddy Chayevsky's "Marty." 
</P>
<P>
 Though Steiger desperately wanted to reprise the role for the 1955 movie, he 
did not get it because he refused to sign a seven-year contract with the 
producers. (The role eventually went to Ernest Borgnine, who won an Oscar -- as 
did the picture.) 
</P>
<P>
 But it was Steiger's live-television performance in "Marty" that caught the 
attention of director Elia Kazan and got him a career-making role opposite 
Marlon Brando in "On the Waterfront." He played Charlie, one of the leaders of 
a crooked longshoreman's union, who tries to keep his brother Terry, a has-been 
boxer played by Brando, from testifying before a waterfront commission about 
union corruption. 
</P>
<P>
 With that performance, Steiger earned his first Oscar nomination (for best 
supporting actor). In 1965, after nearly two dozen pictures (often playing 
heavies), he received his second Oscar nomination, this time for best actor, in 
"The Pawnbroker." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years later, Steiger won the Oscar for best actor in "In the Heat of the 
Night" as a redneck Southern sheriff.

NEW PICK OF THE WEEK

<P>
 The Savoy-Doucet Cajun Band "Live! At the Dance" 
</P>
<P>
 Arhoolie  
</P>
<P>
 Cajun music and dancing are as inseparable as the sausage and rice in 
jambalaya. So it makes perfect sense that this accomplished trio would choose 
to record its latest album at a dance gig. 
</P>
<P>
 People in Southwest Louisiana have been two-stepping and waltzing to many of 
these songs for half a century, and while the vision of a sea of lilting 
dancers is missing, the energy jolt they give the musicians is frequently 
audible. 
</P>
<P>
 Accordionist Marc Savoy can be heard egging on fiddler and singer Michael 
Doucet to new instrumental and vocal heights. Guitarist Ann Savoy provides 
unadorned beauty in her straightforward lead vocals.  
</P>
<P>
 The 18 songs include some Cajun classics that are balanced with enough songs 
pulled from deep in the Cajun repertoire to keep the aficionado intrigued. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the latter is "Quand J'etais Vaillant (When I was a Nice Young Man)." 
Setting the instruments aside, Doucet and Ann Savoy begin this haunting ballad 
singing in unison, an octave apart. They continue trading verses, telling the 
story of a man who is exchanging women for the bottle because of all the 
heartache love has caused him. (Fortunately, the CD booklet includes bilingual 
lyrics so that English-speaking fans can keep up with these timeless stories 
sung in Cajun French.)  
</P>
<P>
 It's one of the few songs here that seems to invite audiences to sit and 
listen. The rest of the time, Marc Savoy's invigorating accordion work, 
Doucet's fiery fiddling and Ann's solid rhythm guitar work -- the trio is 
joined on a half-dozen tunes by bassist Billy Wilson -- defy listeners to 
remain chair-bound. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the only thing keeping this from being the compleat fais do-do 
experience is a collapsible dance floor and a stockpot full of simmering gumbo.

MUSIC/DANCE; MANON BECOMES HER; AFTER A ROCKY START IN THE ROLE, ABT STAR SAYS 
IT'S NOW A FAVORITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

Orange County Edition.

<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a slide in the ballet "Manon" that principal dancer Cynthia Harvey 
will never forget. She was rehearsing the title role during a Royal Ballet of 
Great Britain tour of the Soviet Union in 1987 when disaster struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "My foot caught in a gap in the stage," she recalled. "I tore all the 
ligaments in my left foot and broke the bone in three places. I went to the 
Bolshoi (Ballet) clinic, which told me nothing was wrong!" 
</P>
<P>
 But the mounting pain soon told her otherwise. In a few days, the company had 
to send her back home to New York, where her injury was correctly diagnosed and 
therapy started. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why they didn't tell me in Russia, I'll never know," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't get to dance the role in performance until the following summer 
when the Royal was touring Australia. And then, because the other woman 
scheduled to dance the part was injured, Harvey danced Manon four times, with 
four different partners. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just getting up and doing that slide again was like getting on a horse you've 
fallen off of," she said. "You just know there are some things you have to get 
over. The fact that I was able to do that maybe made me sympathetic to this 
ballet." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Manon is now one of her five favorite roles, she said. (The others 
are Giselle, Aurora, Kitri and Cranko's Juliet.) 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey will be dancing Manon on Tuesday and again on Sept. 24 during the 
American Ballet Theatre engagement at the Orange County Performing Arts Center. 
Two other ABT principal dancers -- Julie Kent and Susan Jaffe -- will also 
dance the role. 
</P>
<P>
 A native of San Rafael, Calif., Harvey, 37, joined Ballet Theatre in 1974. She 
rose to soloist rank in 1978 and became a principal dancer in 1982. From 1986 
to '88, she danced with the Royal Ballet -- the first American ballerina to be 
made a member of the company. She returned to ABT in September, 1988. She now 
spends half her year in New York and half in England, where her husband is a 
design director for the Grand Prix.  
</P>
<P>
 While she was with the Royal, Harvey worked directly with Kenneth MacMillan, 
who choreographed "Manon." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really pleasant to get firsthand training from him," she said. "I see 
Manon as a person who is in love and does things that are not rational, a 
person who lives for the moment and does things not necessarily thinking about 
their consequences. She's capricious in that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "But she's also afraid of losing her social distinction. She was not born of a 
great class, unlike (her young lover) Des Grieux, who was born into a better 
family. She will do anything to not go backward in her social status." 
</P>
<P>
 Because "Manon" is a story ballet, "I don't think you can simply do the 
steps," Harvey said, "although MacMillan has put so much passion into the pas 
de deux that (the character) becomes clear through his choreography. She's 
carried around a lot. I actually quite like it. I don't have to stretch my feet 
so much."  
</P>
<P>
 Does she ever worry about being dropped? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes. We have some very tall men. Standing on their shoulders, I'm higher than 
I ever would be, and then I have to go head down into a dive. You have to trust 
them. So far, touch wood, nothing has happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Which points out one of many differences Harvey sees between herself and 
Manon. "I'm not a kind of person who doesn't think about consequences. I'm 
fairly aware of them," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 * What: American Ballet Theatre dances Kenneth MacMillan's "Manon" on Tuesday, 
Sept. 20, and Sept. 23 through 25. (The company dances shorter repertory by

NIGHT SHIFT; AT CYRANO'S, THE TALK IS FREE, AND DEBATE BREWS ALONGSIDE THE 
COFFEE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES, Rose Apodaca Jones is a free-lance writer who 
contributes regularly to The Times Orange County.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of Orange County coffeehouses aim to create a place where constructive 
talk and ideas are being stimulated almost as often as the customers' nervous 
systems. Instead, most have become just a quick stop for refueling -- in a 
to-go cup, preferably. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Cyrano's Coffee House in Orange, conversation is more than just a 
spontaneous exchange between friends who come in for a cafe latte. Topics are 
cultivated every Thursday evening during an open discussion and debate. 
</P>
<P>
 The only prior consensus reached among the ever-changing group is to "agree to 
disagree," according to moderator John Beringer, who by day happens to make a 
living as a professional mediator. Whether there are five or 25 in the group on 
any given week, the intention is to give all participants a chance to 
articulate views on the topic du jour, which Beringer usually chooses minutes 
before the chat session begins. 
</P>
<P>
 Subjects run the gamut from headline spin-offs such as homosexuals in the 
military and the social circumstances in Africa to debates about men's role in 
society and equality among the sexes. 
</P>
<P>
 The topics might seem esoteric or intellectual, but once the group gets going 
it's apparent that the conversation is accessible to everyone. And everyone has 
an opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Beringer steers the session, restoring order when chaos creeps in and changing 
the format slightly when it no longer works. Speakers are encouraged to direct 
their passionate responses to him rather than toward the person they disagree 
with. 
</P>
<P>
 "Establishing this format diffuses confrontation while still allowing for the 
exchange of information," he says. The search for the ever-allusive truth is 
not on the agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talking allows us not to feel so isolated from the world," Beringer says. He 
started the weekly sessions when the coffeehouse opened two years ago because 
he says he "felt there lacked a sense of community." 
</P>
<P>
 His "community" now includes a range of ages and backgrounds -- brokers, 
housewives, retirees and assorted students and staff who attend nearby Rancho 
Santiago Community College. Some come to the sessions every Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The group meets outside on the patio, surrounded partially by lush foliage and 
illuminated by tiny white lights threaded along trellis archways. Chatty 
smokers are allowed to light up. The rap runs from 7:30 to 9:30, with a midway 
break.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, other even less formal groups assemble in and outside of Cyrano's 
on Thursdays as well as at other times during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 On Mondays at 6:30 p.m., a much younger following attends, more intent on 
listening than on talking -- during the children's story hour. Live music fans 
can enjoy classical, folk, jazz and blues on Friday and Saturday evenings after 
8:30. Jazz finds a regular spot every Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides coffee and other non-alcoholic drinks, a lunch menu offers mostly 
sandwiches and salads from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. 
</P>

FANATICALLY FUNNY; THE COMEDIAN'S PASSION FOR STAND-UP EXTENDS TO PUTTING 
TOGETHER 2 DIFFERENT SHOWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GLENN DOGGRELL, Glenn Doggrell writes about comedy for The Times Orange 
County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Brian Regan's refreshing ability not to take himself too seriously can be 
traced to his teen years in Miami and a high school locker room. The football 
coach and a college scout were huddled in an office discussing players and 
scholarships. The young wide receiver was sitting outside, wondering about his 
future, when the coach called him in. His heart soared. "It's show time!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Could you go get Mike Whittington?" the coach asked. 
</P>
<P>
 That, Regan said from L.A. last week, was one incredible elevator ride, 
lasting less than 5 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 He rebounded, however, and played four seasons at tiny Heidelberg College in 
Tiffin, Ohio, before blowing out his knee in his senior year and discovering 
that playing in pain also meant needles and cortisone. ("C'mon. We were 0-and-8 
last year.") He retired. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at Heidelberg, however, that the friendly, outgoing Regan, who's 
playing the Irvine Improv through Sunday, developed his taste for comedy. After 
giving up on an accounting degree, he turned his major into communications and 
theater arts. He was the unofficial campus emcee and was tapped for several 
comic-relief roles in campus plays. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedy bug bit. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first started, I was just firing buckshot to see what would hit," he 
recalled. "From doing it over and over, you start gravitating to what you hope 
is unique to you. I found my strongest laughs were (for material) about myself 
and my feelings." 
</P>
<P>
 With football behind him and the comedy jones replacing that passion, the 
Miami native quit school 13 credit hours short of a degree. Telling his folks 
wasn't easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still remember that phone call: 'I was wondering if you could, uh, pick me 
up at the airport.' Under the circumstances, they were surprisingly cool. The 
advice they were giving me was so unbelievably sound, but I was listening to it 
with youthful ears." 
</P>
<P>
 He got the ride and he got their understanding, too. 
</P>
<P>
 For many comics, doing "The Tonight Show" or a cable special is a career 
highlight, both of which Regan has done. But Regan's biggest moment occurred 
early in his career at the Comic Strip club in Fort Lauderdale. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had an open-mike night. On my fifth audition, I passed. That's the most 
thrilling night of my career, always will be. That meant I was a local regular. 
I asked (the manager) if I could work seven nights. He said, 'Nobody ever has, 
but I suppose you can if you want.' "  
</P>
<P>
 Regan, one of eight children, was living with his parents in Miami and 
commuting an hour each way to the club. He did it for about a year before 
taking a night off. 
</P>
<P>
 That might sound a little fanatical, but Regan has a passion for stand-up. He 
recently moved to Los Angeles to be closer to the Hollywood scene and admits 
he's after a series, but for the right reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm hoping to get a situation comedy, and it looks like I have some pretty 
strong interest out there. No deal is in place, but an offer has been made. 
We're looking into it now to see where to go from here, so it looks like we'll 
end up with at least something." 
</P>
<P>
 This is where Regan, 36, differs from other comedians. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm planning on keeping my stand-up. I've always thought getting a sitcom 
could help my stand-up career. The more exposure you get, the more the 
audiences are coming out to see you . The audience has a predisposition to like 
you already. You can feel the difference when you go on stage. You can sense 
when an audience is aware of you or not aware of you at all. They just stare, a 
prove-it-to-me crowd. 'We're listening, but you better start scrambling fast, 
clown.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Regan, who spends about three weeks a month on the road, remembers one such 
crowd at a corporate show he did several years back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got off stage and a guy hands me a glass of scotch and asks, 'By the way, 
what do you do?' The guy was trying to be nice. People give you the weirdest 
compliments: 'My brother thinks you stink, but I think you're pretty good.' 
Well, thank you. What the hell was that all about?" 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Regan's reputation precedes him at most places, but he still 
doesn't take any chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just try to establish friendliness before anything else," said the comic, a 
sharp, self-assured performer whose older brother Dennis is also a club 
headliner. "If people like you, they're more inclined to go along on your 
little ride, as opposed to having a chip on your shoulder. I try to let the 
audience know . . . we'll have some fun and get out of here and no one will get 
hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 And as far as TV goes, even if a series happens, Regan doesn't plan on 
trumpeting his triumph without knowing if the show will air for sure. The last 
time he did that was for a "Star Search" show that never happened, despite a 
camera operator's assurances that the producers really liked him.  
</P>
<P>
 "That was good enough for me," Regan said, laughing at the memory. "I was 
blaring from a mountain. People still ask me when that show is going to air." 
</P>
<P>
 But while Regan works on a sitcom deal, he isn't letting his act languish. His 
most recent innovation is putting together two different shows to entice fans 
to come back for another hour of material from his ample canon when he plays a 
club for more than a week. He calls them "The Idiot" and "The Oddity" and plans 
to do them when he returns to Irvine next month.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of weird because nobody else does this. I'm doing it to get a 
return business and to answer this one-man show push," said Regan, referring to 
Ritch Shydner, Robert Dubac, Jeff Jena and others.  
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing against one-man shows, but I love being a stand-up comic, and 
the one-man shows tend to have more of a theatrical connotation to them. 
Sometimes they're doing more serious moments. I want to get on stage and kill 
for an hour. It's almost impossible to kill for an hour and a half. I did this 
as a statement for stand-up. That's what I am, and I'm proud of being that." 
</P>
<P>
 He's also proud to be a Jerry Lewis fan, which is not surprising. Regan's 
mugging and physical style are kissing cousins to Lewis's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the people of France are right. I think he is a comedic genius," 
Regan said, before moving on to other influences when he was starting out in 
the early '80s. "Steve Martin was big then. He really brought silliness into 
the picture. I know some comics feel there needs to be a point of view. I think 
there needs to be a pratfall. Getting the audience laughing is a lofty enough 
goal."

SURFING: SAN CLEMENTE'S BESCHEN RIDING HIGH ON WORLD TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Rockin' Fig & Dave, Rockin' Fig is Rick Fignetti, a Huntington Beach 
surfer/shop owner. Times staff writer David Reyes has reported on U.S. surf 
teams competing in Bali and Brazil. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the world tour wrapping up three contests in France, Rockin' Fig couldn't 
stop yakking about the outstanding season San Clemente's Shane Beschen has been 
having. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Fig: Beschen made it to the semifinals at the Rip Curl Pro in Hossegor, 
France, and HE'S IN SECOND PLACE IN THE WORLD RANKINGS! Former world champion 
Kelly Slater of Florida is leading with 5,350 points, to Beschen's 4,460 
points.  
</P>
<P>
 Beschen did really well in France. And he wasn't the only O.C. ripper over 
there. Jeff Booth got second at Biarritz. So Booth, the Laguna Beach power 
slasher, must have looked good over there, too. In fact, the local O.C. boys 
have been getting hot on the world tour.  
</P>
<P>
 That's different from a few years ago, when Richie Collins of Newport Beach 
was the only great Orange County hope, huh Fig? 
</P>
<P>
 Yup. A coupla years ago is a long time ago. This year is like a whole new book 
for U.S. pro surfers. Especially with Beschen's second - place ranking.  
</P>
<P>
 Rounding out the world tour's Top 10 are Shane Powell and Dave Macaulay, both 
of Australia, third and fourth respectively. In fifth place is Hawaii's Sunny 
Garcia, followed by Brazil's Jojo Olivenca, and Martin Potter of Great Britain. 
In eighth place it's a tie for Flavio Padaratz of Brazil and Stuart 
Bedford-Brown of Australia, and in 10th place is Fabio Gouveia of Brazil. 
Cardiff's Rob Machado is 12th, and Booth is 13th. 
</P>
<P>
 What are Beschen's chances of catching Slater? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Beschen's been on quite a roll. But I gotta say that with only three 
world tour events left -- Brazil, Hawaii and Australia -- and with the nearly 
1,000-point lead that Slater has , it looks like Slater may get his second 
world championship.  
</P>
<P>
 Can Beschen make up the difference in one contest? I know that if Beschen wins 
the world title, it'll make surfers in San Clemente go nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I gotta say that in Slater's case, if he goes to any of the remaining 
three contests, and he gets out of his first heat, he racks up 240 points right 
there. So Beschen has a big mountain to climb.  
</P>
<P>
 Whoomp! There it is! The Figster taking another look into the crystal ball and 
calling it Slater's victory for '94! 
</P>
<P>
 Where's the current champion, Derek Ho? 
</P>
<P>
 Not in the Top 10. It looks like he's out of it for a repeat. But there are 
success stories. Look at Ricardo Tatui of Brazil. He was ranked 45th on the 
roster at Biarritz, had his name last on the contest page. And he wins! They're 
calling it the contest of his life. He took home $14,000!  
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, a world tour news release said: "More than 15,000 spectators watched 
(Tatui) in disbelief." 
</P>
<P>
 A little closer to home, the Fig said we can look for Slater at the U.S. Bud 
Tour's Body Glove Surfbout VII contest at Trestles in northern San Diego 
County. It's part of the World Qualifying Series. Action got started Tuesday. 
Figgy says it's a tri-combo affair with long boards, short boards and body 
boards. 
</P>
<P>
 It's gonna be one of the longest Bud Surf Tour events and will run six days, 
through Sunday.  
</P>
<P>
 Fig, as a contest announcer for the tour, don't you have to get up every 
morning at 5 and trek to Trestles? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah. I know one thing. The Fig's probably gonna camp on that beach to get the 
evening-to-dark glass - off, or maybe wake up early for the dawn patrol. The 
Fig has been known to hit it, mosquitoes or no mosquitoes.  
</P>
<P>
 Mosquitoes? Trestles has mosquitoes? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh man, that lagoon. I've been down there for previous contests and they got 
so thick when the sun went down, I had to wear long-sleeved shirts, pants and a 
hat over my head for complete coverage. They just get you. I've been known to 
get 100 bites just changing into my wet suit down there. They're treacherous!

 Foundation: Meg Bernardo, the U.S. manager for the Assn. of Surfing 
Professionals, said the Huntington Beach-based ASP (the governing body of 
professional surfing) has a new project: The ASP Foundation. They're tapping 
into the popularity of surfing in Southern California and encouraging $15 
memberships for non-professional surfers willing to help pay for some fun 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need money to help with projects that are supported by many of our pro 
surfers," Bernardo said. "In Vietnam, for instance, the younger surfers there 
are so enthusiastic about surfing but they don't have enough surfboards to go 
around, and we're trying to develop an interest in programs."  
</P>
<P>
 Bernardo said they're also talking about projects to develop judges at the 
amateur level and scholarships. The ASP has about 1,000 members. For more 
information, contact Meg at the ASP office: (714) 842-8826.

 Toppled: After reigning as king of the beach in publicity for the recent Op 
Pro and U.S. Open of Surfing here, Mike Kingsbury of MKM Marketing and 
Promotions got tossed off the pedestal -- by his wife, Barbara. Seems that 
Kingsbury dropped everything one Friday night to speak to the Orange County 
Tortoise Society. That's not a typo. Mike and Barbara keep the shelled 
creatures as pets, and Barbara is a society member. So, instead of talking to 
CNN about Slater or Sunny Garcia getting tubed, Kingsbury shared his 
experiences with leafy greens and turtle runways.

 Lost: Has anyone seen T. K. Brimer of the Frog House surf shop in Newport 
Beach? Seems that T.K. got involved in a paddleboard competition to Santa 
Catalina on Aug. 28. But somehow he got lost for several hours while at sea. We 
left messages for T.K. to call but believe he's somewhere on Gilligan's Island 
hangin' with the professor and Mary Ann. (Turns out he zigged when he shoulda 
zagged and took the long way to Avalon.)

DO IT!: CLEAN UP THE SANDS OF TIME -- SUMMERTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF, Rick VanderKnyff is a member of The Times Orange County 
staff.

<TEXT>
<P>
 School has started, marking the unofficial end of summer for Orange County's 
beaches. But though the crowds may be gone, their trash still litters the 
sands. 
</P>
<P>
 Now is when volunteers can help return the local coast to its preseason 
condition. As part of the 10th annual Adopt-a-Beach program, sponsored by the 
California Coastal Commission, volunteers will meet at 15 Orange County sites 
Saturday to collect trash and recyclables along beaches and waterways. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup, part of a statewide program (also been picked up nationally), 
will span the county from Seal Beach to San Clemente. Besides beach areas, the 
effort also targets the wetlands of Bolsa Chica and Upper Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's statistics tell a story: Cigarette butts led the pack, with more 
than 19,000 collected by 3,969 Orange County volunteers. In all, 47,870 pounds 
of debris were collected, more than half of it plastic (six-pack rings, food 
bags, cups and lids, straws and other utensils). Some of the debris is washed 
down in flood-control channels and rivers. 
</P>
<P>
 Collections in previous years have yielded water heaters, a car windshield, a 
Christmas tree and a kitchen sink. Last year's finds in Orange County included 
a mailbox and a bicycle in Upper Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout California, 50,405 volunteers pitched in and removed 512,537 pounds 
of trash found along beaches, parks, riverbanks, highways and inland waterways, 
according to the Coastal Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Aesthetics aren't the only reason for cleaning up the beaches. Wildlife can 
become tangled in six-pack rings -- sometimes fatally -- or may mistake plastic 
items for food. 
</P>
<P>
 "Help make the beach see worthy" is the theme for this year's event, which is 
putting out the call for volunteers. Volunteers should call ahead to sign up 
for a specific location. 
</P>
<P>
 The cleanup starts at 9 a.m. and runs to 1 p.m. Volunteers will be given two 
bags -- one for recyclables and one for non-recyclables -- and are also asked 
to keep tabs on what they pick up on data card that will be handed out to 
participants (the state likes to keep detailed statistics on what is 
collected). 
</P>
<P>
 Some cleanup locations will sell T-shirts, and some will offer entertainment 
and refreshments. The county Department of Harbors, Beaches and Parks is 
coordinating the county's efforts and has details on each location. 
</P>
<P>
 * What: Coastal cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 * When: Saturday, Sept. 17, from 9 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where: 15 locations in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 * Whereabouts: Call for directions to specific locations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wherewithal: No charge. 
</P>
<P>
 * Where to call: (714) 723-4511.

VIEDO REWIND; SMALL-TIME CROOKS HIT ROAD WITH 'COLD FEET,' WARM ENDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK VANDERKNYFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Cold Feet," a comic fable about petty crooks with big dreams, boasts a loopy 
charm, some big laughs and several winning performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Carradine is a dishonest cowboy who is pulling off the heist of a 
lifetime -- involving a horse and a fistful of emeralds -- with the help of two 
partners played by Tom Waits and Sally Kirkland.Not long after crossing the 
Mexican border into the United States, Carradine dumps his cohorts and heads 
for his brother's ranch in Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 That sets off a cross-country chase, with Waits and Kirkland playing one of 
the unlikeliest movie pairs in recent memory. Waits is Kenny, a small-time 
killer and big-time paranoid who swings between psychotic rage and self-pitying 
reflection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually, I think of myself as executive material," he reveals to Maureen 
(Kirkland), sitting by a campfire one evening. "I don't want to grow old as 
just another murderer." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fantasy he plays out in postcards to his mother. "Dear Mommy," he 
writes just days after his most recent killing, "I've been promoted to chief 
executive branch manager." 
</P>
<P>
 Kirkland offers a deliciously over-the-top turn as the one member of the gang 
who actually shows some gift for illicit activities, even if it does keep 
getting undermined by her recurring jags of softhearted sentiment. "You know, 
Maureen," Waits barks at her after one such moment, "sometimes I wonder if 
you're even a criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Robert Dornhelm manages to keep this shaggy-dog road picture on track 
and wraps it up with a warmhearted ending that doesn't feel contrived, and what 
the film lacks in slickness it makes up for in its welcome touches of humor and 
humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cold Feet" (1989), directed by Robert Dornhelm. 94 minutes. Rated R.

KIDS ON FILM: 'NEXT KARATE KID': MIXED MESSAGES ARE AT HAND -- AND AFOOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, Lynn Smith is a staff writer for the Times' Life & Style 
section. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In "The Next Karate Kid," the wise martial - arts expert Mr. Miyagi becomes 
temporary guardian for an angry, belligerent teen-age orphan and teaches her 
discipline, spirituality and a sure-fire way to stop sexual harassment. (Rated 
PG-13)  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever adults worry about the messages movies are sending to kids, kids 
typically like to respond, "It's just a movie!" 
</P>
<P>
 In the didactic Karate Kid series (this is the fourth and the first to feature 
a girl student), the messages are fast and furious -- as painful and obvious as 
a frying pan to the head and as subtle and moving as a Japanese rock garden. 
With the extra added twist of a pretty young woman learning to kick butt, er, 
excuse me, defend herself, the messages are still fast and furious, but also 
contradictory and confusing. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see. Julie's personality is about as appealing as battery acid, and yet 
she attracts both the polite, principled jock Eric and the evil, nasty jock 
Ned, who tries to blackmail her into a date down at the docks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Miyagi teaches her to not only sense danger in the dark and execute a 
superior roundhouse kick, but also buys her a low-cut prom dress that turns 
Eric into a mindless noodle. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese Americans are portrayed as both patriotic victims of injustice during 
World War II and as cute spiritualists who use Zen to win at bowling. Miyagi, 
wiser by far than most mortals, still speaks only pidgin English. 
</P>
<P>
 In the ultimate mixed message, Julie learns to revere the life of a cockroach 
at a Buddhist monastery but is later urged to pummel Ned after he has wiped the 
dock with Eric. "Fighting not good," Miyagi tells Julie. "But if must fight, 
win."  
</P>
<P>
 High school teachers, of course, are either stupid or sadistic to the point of 
encouraging manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 But, hey, it's just a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-year-olds Timothy Clancy and Chris Gilbert said they liked what they took 
as the film's anti-sexist message. Neither knew much about karate but said it 
was a good lesson to show a girl standing up for herself and vanquishing 
bullies by herself.  
</P>
<P>
 "I bet boys thought she'd lose," Timothy said. "It was good to show boys that 
boys aren't always better than girls." 
</P>
<P>
 Agreed Chris: "So they won't be prejudiced."  
</P>
<P>
 But Lauren O'Grady, 12, thought this sequel was inferior to the others, even 
though it featured a girl. She wanted more realism. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could tell the fighting was really fake," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other parts struck her as unlikely. For instance, she didn't think anyone 
could really keep a wild bird, as Julie did, as a pet in a pigeon cage on top 
of the school. Nor did she think a girl would be as sexually harassed as she 
was by the boys at school.  
</P>
<P>
 She suggested younger kids might like it better than she did. 
</P>
<P>
 But her friend Katharine Shiota, 12, gave it a thumbs up. She liked what she 
saw as the family messages: that Julie overcame her bitterness over the loss of 
her beloved parents and learned how to go on with life even though it is 
sometimes unfair.  
</P>
<P>
 To her, the movie was realistic. "All the problems could really happen," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Except she didn't think a high school coach would lead a Nazi-like group of 
law-and-order jocks and encourage them to violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a teacher would be that mean," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Katharine liked the familiar formula of the Karate Kid movies. "They're funny, 
and they always have a lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 And if you can't figure out what it is exactly, well, maybe it's just a movie 
after all.

 Taste of Newport will feature sampling of cuisines from 35 area restaurants 
this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 McCormick and Schmick's, for instance, offers Dungeness crab cakes with smoked 
chili aioli, bay scallop ceviche with three-colored tortilla chips or chocolate 
truffle cake with raspberry sauce, at $1 each; Marrakesh offers salad, bastilla 
and a lamb brochette for $4. Don't overdo it, or you might end up taking your 
cue from the names of two of the eight bands providing entertainment -- Jack 
Mack & the Heart Attack and (if you really overdo it) Three Dog Night. 
</P>

 Benefits at restaurants on Sunday sound almost cinematic in scope: "Rebel With 
a Cause" (for Laguna Art Museum) and "La Dolce Vita!" (for Cystic Fibrosis 
Foundation) will take place at Ruby's Auto Diner and Antonello Ristorante, 
respectively. Tickets to Ruby's Harley hop in Laguna Beach are $30, and it runs

 Classic wine and food pairings are one thing, food matchups with 10 beers from 
around the world entirely another. Some of the combos chef Lasse Sorensen has 
brewing for an informal dinner at John Dominis on Friday are obvious: Asahi 
with sushi, Bass Ale with fish and chips, Dos Equis with fajitas. Others, such 
as nonalcoholic Buckler with smoked halibut toast and Kiwi Lager with blackened 
chicken and peanut sauce, can't yet be called classics.  
</P>
<P>
 The tasting is from 7 to 10 p.m.; $35 per person includes tax and gratuity.

 What's this? A five-course winemaker dinner called "The Wines of Chalone" at 
Sfuzzi Bistro featuring only one wine of Chalone? Yes and no. Chalone is, of 
course, a celebrated Northern California Chardonnay and Pinot Noir producer. 
But the Chalone Wine Group operates that winery as well as Acacia and Carmenet. 
The Chalone wine called Chalone will accompany lobster and spinach manicotti 
with toasted lemon hazelnut sauce; other courses will be paired with Acacia and 
Carmenet wines.

RESTAURANTS; PIZZA TAKES THE CAKE AMONG ECLECTIC FARE AT GRILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAX JACOBSON, Max Jacobson is a free-lance writer who reviews restaurants 
weekly for The Times Orange County. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Who'd be zany enough to put pineapple salsa, smoked Gouda, fresh papaya, chili 
peppers, ginger, lime juice, toasted coconut and Canadian bacon on a pizza and 
call it Maui Wowie? 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Hofman, owner of Cornerstone Grill, that's who. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you remember this handsome brick-and-wrought-iron edifice when it was 
Brea's much-ballyhooed special-occasion restaurant, Magnolia's Peach. That 
peach-oriented restaurant was notable for such oddball dishes as broiled 
chicken crowned with peach sauce, as well as its Bellini cocktail (champagne 
mixed with peach juice). 
</P>
<P>
 Hofman, who recently acquired this property, has completely renovated the 
interior, adding a pool parlor and, for die-hard sports fans, throwing in 16 
TVs, mostly on a bar patio above the dining areas. From a design standpoint, 
Cornerstone Grill is loaded: lush carpeting, long blue velvet curtains, Op Art 
upholstery, irregularly shaped wooden tables, a shiny refinished floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the multitude of TVs, Hofman doesn't want his clientele to think of 
Cornerstone Grill as a sports bar or hangout. The concept here is that 
weather-beaten favorite, the creative American grill: pizzas, pastas, 
rotisserie items, salads, upscale desserts. The result is the perfect 
restaurant for those who get a sudden urge to watch the Rams while dining (or 
vice versa), or for anyone who likes to shoot a friendly game of nine-ball 
while waiting for a table. It may be less than perfect for those who expect 
minor miracles out of kitchens. 
</P>
<P>
 Hofman, of course, is the man responsible for Hof's Hut, a popular local chain 
of coffee shops, and an upscale eatery called Hof's Grill, located a short 
stretch down Imperial Highway from the new restaurant. So a lot of his food 
ideas are well-known to Orange County restaurant-goers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizza is as good a starting place as any on Cornerstone Grill's ambitious, 
outsized menu. The medium-thick crust is laced with honey, so it has a mild 
sweetness. Toppings range from conventional to a walk on the wild side, with 
mixed results. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maui Wowie mentioned above turns out to be sweet, all right, but far less 
cloying than the description might lead you to expect. The dominant flavors are 
smoky Gouda and salty Canadian bacon, with the coconut and papaya playing minor 
notes on the taste buds. "It's a huge seller," confided Hofman by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken with candied garlic pizza is a more appealing surprise, the roasted 
garlic cloves and tiny pieces of rotisserie chicken working a harmonious duet. 
Sticks and stones pizza is basically sausage and pepperoni, the twist being 
that the pepperoni is cut into thick, crunchy, irregularly shaped sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 My instincts rightly warned me the pastas would be slapdash and overcooked. 
Spicy melanzane is a good idea: normally penne pasta, roasted Japanese 
eggplant, olive oil, plenty of flaked red chili, marinara sauce. Inexplicably, 
though, our penne (one of the hardest pastas to overcook) was replaced by mushy 
linguine. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thai pasta -- topped with rotisserie chicken, an overpowering peanut 
butter sauce, bean sprouts, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots and straw mushrooms 
-- is another adventure in mushy linguine. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone fond of chicken flavored with peanut butter would do better to order 
the Chinese chicken. This is a bargain at $7.95: an enormous bird, three kinds 
of fried noodles, a mountain of Napa cabbage, spinach and cucumber, a fistful 
of sesame and more. 
</P>
<P>
 All the salads are entree-sized, from a classic Cobb to an unusual blackened 
halibut Caesar -- a dish that fails to prove that grated hard cheese and fish 
flavors go well together. There are good hearty homemade soups like spicy 
vegetable, the kind of fare that made Hof's Hut a success.  
</P>
<P>
 The entire menu is available at both lunch and dinner, but during the noon 
hour most people choose one of the restaurant's giant sandwiches. You can't 
lose with the hot roast turkey: tender meat on grilled sourdough with some of 
the best mashed potatoes and country gravy in town. The thin-sliced tri-tip, 
though, is sugared to death by candied onions and a sticky-sweet barbecue 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 That barbecue sauce works better on the tender, meaty baby back ribs, a sure 
bet here. You can also get a nice piece of hardwood-grilled pork tenderloin, 
served with apple sauce and mashed potatoes. Just tell them to lose the 
candy-like raspberry sauce the meat rests on. 
</P>
<P>
 At eclectic restaurants such as this one, stir-fries are often too salty, so 
we asked our obliging waiter to ease up on the salt in the chicken stir fry. He 
did, but this melange of nearly a dozen vegetables and well-cooked rice still 
had a problem -- an unfortunate sweet soy aftertaste.  
</P>
<P>
 You'll be safer with pricey entrees like the 20-ounce Porterhouse ($18.95) or 
a charbroiled piece of fresh fish (prices quoted daily). The steak would have 
elicited a major rave, in fact, had the accompanying baked potato not been 
mealy. 
</P>
<P>
 The dessert list is short and (of course) sweet, an abbreviated version of the 
Hof's Hut pies and cake list. The rich chocolate blackout cake is great, and so 
is Aunt April's brown-sugar-happy apple crisp. 
</P>
<P>
 Should those dessert choices miss, fall back on the Maui Wowie. Have them hold 
the cheese, peppers and bacon and you're home. 
</P>
<P>

PARKER'S PLACE: CAN A COLUMNIST AND HIS READERS SEE I TO I? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T. JEFFERSON PARKER, T. Jefferson Parker is a novelist and writer who lives 
in Orange County. His column appears in OC Live! the first three Thursdays of 
every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly two years ago, my first column appeared in this newspaper. It was about 
bodysurfing at 15th Street in Newport, and it was hard to write because I'd 
never done a column before. I was a little worried that bodysurfing might not 
be of interest to many readers, oddball sport that it is. 
</P>
<P>
 I was even more worried that readers wouldn't care one bit about my opinions, 
experiences or thoughts about bodysurfing -- or anything else, for that matter. 
This is a doubt that I still carry to my typewriter each week as I begin a new 
piece. 
</P>
<P>
 The column began as an experiment, both for The Times and for me. They were 
curious to see if a crime writer might dismount from his violent novels long 
enough to apply his eye to daily life in Orange County. I was curious to see 
what that other part of me might be thinking -- the part not lost to the 
complexities of plot, the exploration of fictional characters, the often 
grueling three-year marathon of putting together a novel. 
</P>
<P>
 After 72 essays, certain patterns have emerged. I've kept all the pieces in a 
stack on my desk, piled up from Oct. 1, 1992, through Sept. 8, 1994, as 
sophisticated a filing system as I've been able to devise. 
</P>
<P>
 The stack is about three inches high, depending on how hard you grab it. The 
bottom pages are yellowed from the afternoon sun that floods this room; the 
upper ones are still the off-white of fresh newsprint. It's a curious feeling 
to be able to hold roughly two years of work in one hand and have it weigh 
about as much as a pair of tennis shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading through this material, I reflected on what I thought I'd been trying 
to do in this space. My primary mandate from The Times was to write what was 
described as an "action" column. This, the editors explained, didn't 
necessarily mean that I'd go out and do quirky things like bungie-jump or fly 
with the Blue Angels every week, but rather that I would base each column 
around a "go and do" format. What I went and did was up to me: It could be as 
simple as sitting in a pub and watching the world go by, so long as it was 
something that readers in Orange County might be interested in. 
</P>
<P>
 No writer could have gotten a more tempting proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 What The Times was offering me was a blank newspaper page to fill thrice 
monthly with columns about things I would go and do. 
</P>
<P>
 What a cakewalk! 
</P>
<P>
 I remember sitting in a restaurant, hearing this job description from some of 
the editors, wondering if I'd forgotten to swab my ears recently. In my 
original enthusiasm I neglected to consider that I'd written a total of zero 
columns in my career. Even while I sat there outwardly grousing about pay, 
office time required and editorial control (they weren't going to get this 
writer without a fight!) inwardly I was scrolling through the dozens of really 
bitchin' things I could go do and write about. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, I was inwardly deciding what I would not write about. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't willing to write topical pieces, because I have so little grasp of 
politics, events, trends. The Times already had people doing this far better 
than I ever could. And I didn't want to write something that would only hold 
water briefly, while its subject was hot. I'd covered the news for five years 
as a very young man and had had enough of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, I decided not to write about other people. This precept was not 
born of the staggering egotism it might suggest, but from the somewhat humbler 
notion that the press was already chock-full of profiles, slice-of-life pieces 
and personality sketches far better than I could produce. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought of Pete Hammil, Bob Green and Jim Murray, knowing I couldn't match 
up. Besides, I'd done that before, too, and can tell you it wasn't a lot of 
fun. 
</P>
<P>
 So, if you're not going to write about events or people, you're pretty much 
stuck with yourself as a topic. What a drearily self-centered agenda! I began 
counting the times "I" appeared in each piece, wondering when I'd have to start 
writing about someone more interesting than myself.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the antidote to this kind of icky solipsism is the idea that the 
writer can sometimes lose himself in a subject enough to bring that subject 
alive. He kind of sets the stage, then gets off it. So, as I began writing many 
of these columns, it was with the idea that I'd offer the reader something 
other than myself. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, it's interesting to see just what this has been. Dogs, books and 
writing, travel adventures, snakes, hunting, tennis, bodysurfing, movies and 
fathers have each been the subject of multiple columns. 
</P>
<P>
 There have also been one-time forays into watching grass grow, seeing stars 
fall, a trapeze artist who crashed, getting a suntan, the Laguna fire, how to 
organize your mail, spring, autumn, report cards, shopping, old men. 
</P>
<P>
 A great many of the pieces feature myself as the subject, not just the fulcrum 
around which tales are spun. They are plainly, obviously, unquestionably me. 
</P>
<P>
 Several columns are about my wife -- her life and illness and passing. These, 
too, are about me, because there is no way to write about someone you loved 
without writing about the way you loved her. 
</P>
<P>
 So here it comes, looping back into the column I had tried to write myself out 
of, a comet with my own face on it. At some point, you just hope that what 
you've been through is what other people have been through too. 
</P>
<P>
 I thank all of you who have borne with me. It's truly been an honor to have 
your attention for a few minutes each month.

3-HOUR TOUR: FEAST ON NATURE IN PARK, THEN ON PERSIAN FOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BENJAMIN EPSTEIN, Benjamin Epstein is a free-lance writer who contributes 
frequently to the Times Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the antidote for civilization is wilderness, rugged Santiago Oaks Regional 
Park offers a good dose. The trail system seems to go forever, and to places 
with names like Robbers Roost. If you gotta go back to civilization, it may as 
well be Persian, and the "fine Persian cuisine" at Darya; start with a bite of 
raw onion and end with refreshing faloodeh -- "shredded iced starch in sugar." 
</P>
<P>
 10 to 10:10: Windes Drive wends its way among homes for the horsy set and ends 
at the Santiago Oaks park office. Stop in to get a map and to admire the 
stuffed bobcat and great horned owl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob Bobcat is running around out there," noted park ranger Kathy Vanderpool. 
"I've seen him, and he's beautiful. And on our campfire walk the other night we 
saw two juvenile great horned owls, two babies, just at the beginning of the 
dam trail." 
</P>
<P>
 Must be some trail. Vanderpool was in fact referring to the path to County 
Historic Landmark No. 151, a submerged dam built in 1879. She suggested a visit 
to the nature center, a hike to the dam and, energy permitting, a more 
demanding jaunt to Robbers Roost, called Robbers Peak on official maps. 
</P>
<P>
 There, she said, "once upon a time, robbers and outlaws hung out, when they'd 
stole the gold and run away." A fairy tale? You decide. 
</P>
<P>
 10:10 to 10:30: In the nature center are a stuffed redtail hawk with a snake, 
also stuffed, in its beak, and a stuffed opossum and badger. In the center of 
the center is a display of "undifferentiated sespe and vaqueros" rocks; while 
they indeed seem undifferentiated, the vaqueros apparently contains "fossil 
evidence of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 A "Gabrielenos Indian Nature Market" exhibit shows how the county's indigenous 
people used mugwort instead of Bayer aspirin for headaches, poison oak for Rit 
Dye Black 15, amole instead of Ivory soap, and ground-up coast live oak acorns 
instead of Gold Medal All Purpose Enriched White Flour. "Just the Bare Facts 
About Grizzly Bears" includes the only known photograph of a Santa Ana grizzly 
-- oddly enough called "Little Black Bear" -- and notes that famous bear hunter 
Jonathan Watson killed a grizzly at Robbers Peak.  
</P>
<P>
 10:30 to 10:45: Outside the center are shaded picnic tables and places to tie 
your horse. Before hitting that dam trail, there are drinking fountains for 
people and remarkably similar fountains for horses. And note the posted 
warnings: "Mountain Lion Country a Risk," "Rattlesnakes May Be Found" and 
"Ticks Occur." 
</P>
<P>
 One rather large sign along the trail identified surrounding vegetation as 
poison oak. Critters abounded. Lizards did pushups in the middle of the path, 
baby lizards skittered about, squirrels scurried, woodpeckers pecked, and other 
birds flitted from branch to branch. Arachnophiles would have admired fairly 
sizable, colorful spiders in amazingly engineered webs. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs at the Carpenter Serrano dam say not to wade in the water, but the murky 
pool would dissuade most comers anyway. Dragonflies patrol the surface, only 
occasionally coming to light on the rocky shorelet. 
</P>
<P>
 The use of the dam by people was discontinued in 1976, but it now serves as a 
source of water for park animals. 
</P>
<P>
 10:45 to noon: Near the dam is a set of steps. I took them, and within minutes 
I didn't know where the heck I was. There are few directional signs in the 
park; if you have a destination in mind, the rangers in the office can mark 
your map, but that still might not help a whole lot. 
</P>
<P>
 I headed in what I felt might possibly be the general direction of Robbers 
Roost. 
</P>
<P>
 Trails seemed to go nowhere, everywhere and anywhere, but by always taking the 
steepest choice possible, I eventually happened upon what seemed an ideal roost 
for robbers. It was a dramatic 360-degree lookout, and at the points of a 
compass that I didn't have were stables, power lines, the Villa Park dam and 
five ridgelines receding into the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Notorious bandits such as Joaquin Murieta and Three Finger Jack, who 
terrorized local communities and preyed upon the Butterfield Stage in the late 
1800s, easily spotted sheriff's posses from such a vantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Noon to 1: You can plan a takeout feast on the nature center picnic tables, or 
you can enjoy a complete change of scenery, and air conditioning, at newly 
remodeled Darya. 
</P>
<P>
 Dough, a yogurt drink with mint, will cool you down from your hike. Eating 
those raw onions on the table may cause somewhat dubious breath, but the torshi 
appetizer -- aged pickles, carrots, cauliflower, eggplants and herbs in grape 
vinegar ($2.50) -- will literally take your breath away. 
</P>
<P>
 Kebabs are $7 to $13, but "daily dishes" are $7 to $9, and the same dishes 
served at lunchtime on weekdays are in the $6 range. Fesenjan is cooked walnuts 
in pomegranate sauce served with chicken and a huge mound of basmati rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Baghali polo is rice mixed with dill weed and lima beans and comes with lamb 
shanks. Adas polo, rice mixed with raisins, lentils, dates and saffron, came 
with chicken unfortunately baked dry; ask for a little broth on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 Squeeze a little lemon in your faloodeh ($2.50), a rose water, shredded noodle 
dessert, and bring the meal to a delightful end. 3-Hour Tour

 * Now that Labor Day is behind us, the campaigning for the November election 
is in full swing.

<P>
 Reading the newspaper and flyers received through the mail and listening to 
the TV news and TV campaign announcements it is great to see that we have only 
one party to vote for: the Democ-Repub Party. 
</P>
<P>
 And in California only one candidate for each of the top post, i.e., Kathleen 
Pete Brown Wilson for governor and Dick Dianne Huffington Feinstein for U.S. 
senator. 
</P>
<P>
 Personally I am going to vote for the new party "None of the above." 
</P>
<P>
 Until we get a party that will listen to the people and not to the special 
interests "None of the above" will always get my vote.

VIACOM TAPS TIME WARNER EXEC FOR TOP DEAL-MAKING POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In one of its most significant hires since buying Paramount Communications, 
Viacom Inc. named Time Warner executive Thomas McGrath on Wednesday to a top 
deal-making position in the group that oversees the company's movie studio, 
television operations and other entertainment units. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath was named to the newly created post of executive vice president of the 
Viacom Entertainment Group, in a move that had been rumored in entertainment 
circles since last month. He reports directly to Viacom Entertainment Chairman 
Jonathan L. Dolgen and will be based at the Paramount Pictures lot in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath, 39, most recently was president of Time Warner International 
Broadcasting, and was also a senior vice president of business development for 
Time Warner Inc.'s Home Box Office pay cable station. His principal job was 
setting up television deals overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate interviews, Dolgen and McGrath emphasized that McGrath's new job 
will not involve operations, but rather will emphasize the planning and 
implementation of strategic deals. McGrath added that he will not be involved 
in the individual film deals that studio executives traditionally negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources suggested that McGrath's most immediate task will be helping Viacom 
divest some assets, notably its 50% stake in the 350-screen Cineamerica chain 
of theaters -- known for its Mann Theaters -- and also its Famous Music 
publishing unit. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath is also likely to get involved in helping Paramount set up 
independently financed production deals at the studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen said he hired McGrath largely because of McGrath's "great transactional 
skills," noting that it's hard to find people with good deal-making abilities 
at a time when industry transactions are becoming increasingly sophisticated. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath has known Dolgen for years, dating back to their days at Columbia 
Pictures with current Viacom President Frank Biondi. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath's highest-profile job in entertainment was as president of Norman 
Lear's Act III Communications from 1986 to 1990, where he helped build the 
company into a diversified media firm with movie theaters, television stations 
and magazines. He also helped get the company involved in such films as "Stand 
by Me," "The Princess Bride" and "Fried Green Tomatoes."

BOOK REVIEW NONFICTION; NO ROOM FOR PUBLIC DEBATE IN THIS POLITICALLY CORRECT 
WORLD; IN DEFENSE OF ELITISM BY WILLIAM A. HENRY III ; DOUBLEDAY $20, 224 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEX RAKSIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has become almost commonplace in America to be virtually silent in public 
about the values we espouse so passionately in private. We are silent, of 
course, in a well-intentioned effort to promote cultural harmony.  
</P>
<P>
 But I would argue that without the occasional, provocative interruptions from 
loudmouths such as William Henry III, our public silence may well have just the 
opposite effect: widening the already troubling gaps between what whites and 
blacks, men and women, conservatives and liberals, believe. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last year, two prominent writers -- James Q. Wilson in "The Moral 
Sense" and Robert Wright in "The Moral Animal" -- have broken this silence by 
defending traditional values similar to Henry's. But whereas Wilson and Wright 
have couched their arguments in the softer language of philosophy and science, 
respectively, Henry goes out of his way to be provocatively blunt. 
</P>
<P>
 A Pulitzer Prize-winning critic with a habit of working 80-hour weeks (first 
for the Boston Globe, then for Time magazine), Henry confesses that in those 
few moments when he takes a break from the green glow of his computer screen 
and looks around him, he sees a country seemingly chucking the values -- in 
equality and industry, curiosity and rationality -- that he holds so dear. 
</P>
<P>
 On TV, a beer commercial advises "Why ask why?" while a Wheel of Fortune 
contestant, asked which letters might be found missing in "Secretar of State 
Gerge Sht," says, "Pat, Give me an M , please." In state capitals, officials 
help foster the belief that life itself is a wheel of fortune by enticing 
citizens to gamble their money away in lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
 In schools, special interests leave officials so cowed that a deaf girl (or 
"student with a birthright of silence") is allowed to enter a national speech 
contest, while a leading American literature textbook excludes "overrepresented 
. . . male Jews" like Saul Bellow in favor of "rediscovered" feminist writers 
like Charlotte Perkins Gilman. And finally, in the streets, activists denounce 
as "white values" the injunctions "go to school, get a job, get married." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, advance reviews in the book trade have dismissed Henry as 
merely another white male snob "lashing back" at the hard-fought gains of women 
and minorities. And indeed, Henry anticipates that he will be lumped in with 
"some pretty strange bedfellows -- racists, male supremacists, patriotic 
zealots, reactionaries, religious exotics, and assorted other creeps." 
</P>
<P>
 But Henry -- a registered Democrat, "card-carrying member of the ACLU" and the 
recipient of national awards for his journalism in defense of civil and gay 
rights -- persuasively argues that a kind of anti-intellectual Populism is 
running amok today that is "eerily reminiscent" of the 19th-Century 
"Know-Nothing Movement": 
</P>
<P>
 "Where that movement centered on ugly nativism and exclusion," Henry writes, 
"this one carries inclusion to its comparable extreme, celebrating every 
arriviste notion, irate minority group, self-assertive culture and cockamamie 
opinion as having equal cerebral weight, and probably superior moral heft, to 
the reviled wisdom and attainments of tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps most controversially, Henry questions the central American promise of 
"equality for all." While "equality of opportunity" is a reasonable and 
reachable goal, he argues, "equality of outcomes" is impossible because people 
have significantly different levels of intelligence and motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not to suggest that Henry's book is being slammed simply because it is 
bold. On the contrary, one can have a field day pointing out its faults: 
</P>
<P>
 Automatically equating social success with mental intelligence, Henry fails to 
consider that wealth can be inherited rather than earned and that our society 
often reserves its stingiest rewards for those who help it most (e.g., public 
school teachers). He claims that America's "elite" elected representatives are 
allowed to "trust their brains and chart their own courses," while in fact most 
men and women in Congress seem forced to trust only their focus groups and to 
chase mostly after campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Most disturbing, he claims that "any benefit to society from the mother's 
working has to be weighted against the developmental loss to the next 
generation." Henry means well: He's concerned that today's kids have come to 
see their parents for only a blink at breakfast and bedtime. But in contending 
that the only solution is for a single caretaker (the mother, his language 
strongly suggests) to stay at home "at least until the children enter school," 
he is essentially asking women to commit professional suicide by dropping out 
of today's rapidly changing job market. A far better solution is for men and 
women to share child-care burdens, something that could come about if 
businesses would only offer dual-income couples the option of a four-day 
workweek. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, just when Henry stretches our tolerance for the offensive to its limit 
(as when he writes, "It's scarcely the same thing to put a man on the moon as 
to put a bone in your nose"), he manages to win our sympathy back with 
self-deprecating humor. At one point, for instance, he acknowledges that "any 
woman still reading is probably wishing she could puncture my bombastic carcass 
with whatever is the contemporary equivalent of a hatpin." 
</P>
<P>
 Such readers need wish no more, for shortly after finishing this book last 
summer, Henry died in London of a heart attack. 
</P>
<P>
 I, at least, will miss him, for it strikes me that even worse than all of his 
ideological excesses in defending traditional values is our culture's 
increasing reluctance to discuss those values in public.

 CAIRO ALL-NIGHTER: Vice President Al Gore is getting high marks for staying up 
much of the night to rewrite his speech to the recent U.N. population 
conference in Cairo. Gore, known for ash-canning texts prepared for him, 
discarded a draft prepared by the State Department and the National Security 
Council and wrote a version that hewed closely to positions he outlined earlier 
in a Washington speech. . . . The long night paid dividends. His speech drew 
high praise for, among other things, narrowing the rift between the Clinton 
Administration and the Vatican. "Gore really pulled our chestnuts out of the 
fire," said a senior Administration official.

 COUNTING CHICKENS: The political winds have sent a chill through Democratic 
senators on Capitol Hill. In recent months, Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), chairman 
of the Budget Committee, has been running hard among colleagues for the post of 
majority leader, which is to be vacated by retiring Sen. George J. Mitchell 
(D-Me.) next year. Suddenly, however, amid President Clinton's sinking 
fortunes, Sasser has found himself among the growing ranks of Democrats facing 
tougher-than-expected reelection challenges. . . . Sasser, a three-term 
liberal-to-moderate who won 65% of the vote in 1988, is opposed by wealthy 
Nashville heart surgeon Bill Frist. Sources say that concern about Sasser's 
prospects was expressed at a glum meeting of the Democratic Senate Campaign 
Committee when panicky lawmakers returned from their summer recess this week. 
"Sasser's race has tightened dramatically," said a Democratic Senate staffer. 
"I think he'll focus back home now." . . . One thing is for sure: If the likes 
of Sasser should be swept out by a Republican tidal wave in November, the top 
Senate Democrat in 1995 will be leading the minority, not the majority.

 FEINSTEIN RULES: In his new book "Dianne Feinstein: Never Let Them See You 
Cry," San Francisco Chronicle journalist Jerry Roberts recites the California 
senator's rules for getting ahead. Some of them read straight out of a 
management seminar: "Be loyal," "Be a team player" and "Put in more time than 
anyone else." Others provide useful advice for candidates seeking political 
office: "Do not cry. No matter what" and "Use your appearance to create an 
image of strength." . . . Then there are rules, laid down by Feinstein in the 
mid-1980s, when she was considered vice presidential material, that may elicit 
chortles in some quarters. The first: "Don't wear your sex like a badge on your 
sleeve," is a theme discarded in 1992, the so-called Year of the Woman that 
helped catapult Feinstein and fellow Californian Barbara Boxer into the Senate. 
And Feinstein, a notorious micro-manager who sweats every detail, might save 
her staff a few headaches if she delegated responsibility in keeping with 
another early rule: "Learn how to be a manager."

 JOGGING MEMORIES: Republican strategists are considering a novel way to tie 
Democratic congressmen to President Clinton by depicting them jogging with the 
chief executive when his popularity was higher. Walter Jones Jr., the 
Republican challenger to Rep. H. Martin Lancaster (D-N.C.), is using a 
television ad showing a somewhat breathless Lancaster on a jog with Clinton. . 
. . Other Republican candidates, especially in the South, may use similar 
commercials against the President's other Democratic jogging partners. Rep. 
Bill Paxon (R-N.Y.), chairman of the National Republican Congressional 
Committee, says: "B.C. doesn't stand for Bill Clinton in the South, but (for) 
'ball and chain.' "

SCOTT HARRIS: CSUN PRESIDENT A STUDY IN TOLERANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once upon a time, a precocious young girl sat in a classroom in New Jersey and 
sadly learned that the Earth was becoming too crowded. Overpopulation, she was 
told, was fouling the air and water. The planet was at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the solution dawned on little Blenda Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I developed a fabulous, brilliant theory that everybody over 50 should be 
killed," she recalled, laughing. "If you could imagine, I was 12 or 13, and 50 
was just real old. And I touted it. I talked about it. . . . It was with a 
passion that I had this great theory." 
</P>
<P>
 Blenda Wilson, 53, today is the president of California State University, 
Northridge, and occupies handsome but temporary quarters on the quake-damaged 
campus. It wasn't clear where her story was heading. We were supposed to be 
discussing the latest social tremor to strike CSUN: a protest by the Black 
Student Union over the hiring of a white instructor to teach basic English 
skills in the Pan-African studies department. The students contended that 
Katherine Komis, because she is white, lacked the cultural understanding 
necessary to teach in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 So what was Wilson getting at? Was she comparing the BSU's complaints to the 
folly of a child? Would the students find her words patronizing? Was she 
dissing the students? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The short answer is no, and readers unfamiliar with Wilson should probably be 
informed that she is black. When she was inaugurated as CSUN president in 
April, 1993, Wilson became the nation's only African-American woman to head a 
university serving more than 25,000. In a better world, a world where people 
are judged by the content of their character, her race might be irrelevant. But 
Cal State Northridge is not located in that promised land. 
</P>
<P>
 The flap over the hiring of Komis marks the third time during Wilson's tenure 
that ethnic tension has put the campus in headlines. In early 1993, Wilson 
addressed an angry crowd of mostly Latino students who were protesting the 
reinstatement of a predominantly Anglo fraternity. The frat had been suspended 
for violating school racism codes because of a party flyer featuring lyrics to 
a drinking song that refer to a fictional Mexican prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Wilson's office monitored a feud between Jewish and black students 
over the BSU's sponsorship of a lecture by Louis Farrakhan, the controversial 
Nation of Islam minister known for anti-Semitic remarks. After a BSU leader 
wrote a letter accusing Jewish students of "Hitlerian tactics" for scheduling 
an alternative event during Farrakhan's talk, Wilson issued a statement 
declaring the letter "insulting and disrespectful to Jews." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrakhan's visit commemorated the 25th anniversary of a CSUN protest that 
helped lead to the establishment of the Pan-African studies department. Today, 
debate still rages over ethnic studies programs and whether they serve to 
divide or enrich our multicultural society. The recent BSU protest, such a 
slow-moving target, did critics a favor. In a society where many people, 
especially white men, object to "affirmative action" hiring policies, in a 
sensitive age in which a mild ethnic observation may elicit charges of racism, 
here was a group of black activists flatly advocating discrimination against 
whites. Critics took aim in letters to various newspapers, accusing BSU members 
of bigotry. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson received correspondence as well. "The letters that disturb me the 
most," she said, "are those that would suggest that some terrible crime was 
going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather that condemn the protest, Wilson's administration said it was 
interested in the students' views but disagreed with their conclusions. Wilson 
and the African-American faculty members who hired Komis over several other 
candidates, some of whom were black, were steadfast in expressing the 
traditional values of the civil rights movement. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson suggests the students' dissent is typical and healthy on a college 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "Had there not been people who were unpopular . . . some of the 
accomplishments we've made would not have been achieved," she said. The young 
"should be questioning the kind of world we created for them. . . . That 
doesn't mean they're going to be right every time they raise it. But if they 
didn't raise it, our society would be in peril, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But back to little Blenda's plan to save the world. What was her point, 
anyway?  
</P>
<P>
 "Of course my family and friends thought I was totally nuts. And yet they 
didn't act like I was a genocidal maniac." 
</P>
<P>
 These days, Blenda Wilson's notions for saving the world involve civil rights 
and civility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tolerance," she said, "is not something that is taught only in a course on 
ethics. It's taught by how we behave daily on the campus toward one another. . 
. . Those are things that we teach day to day by what we expect and how we live 
together in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can disagree with the idea," she added, "without attributing bad motive 
and ill character to these students."

 Volunteers Sought 
</P>
<P>
 If you could spare an afternoon to read to a child, or teach how to paint, sew 
or crochet, Project S.H.U.E. needs you as a volunteer. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, now on its third year, will open again this September to provide 
after-school activities for children, ages 6 to 9, who live in apartments 
across the street from the Senior Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Center Supervisor Betty Goyne said that about 50 children are expected 
to participate in the program this year. In the past two years, about 60 
students had enrolled in the program, which is funded by a grant from the 
Hitachi Foundation and community development block grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Paid positions are also available. Paid employees work five days a week, from 
2 p.m. to 6 p.m. Nine seniors and four college students have worked as paid 
employees in the past two years, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of the students have limited English skills, and some live in 
homes, where there may be drug abuse or gang activities, Goyne said. 
</P>
<P>
 To volunteer, call Goyne or program director Judy Bruland at (714) 895-2878.

PERSONAL BEST: NOTABLE ACHIEVERS IN YOUR COMMUNITY; VOLUNTEER PUTS A SPECIAL

 Margarita Navas may go unnoticed in the blur of a volunteer project, but 
Saundra Bryant can tell when the 29-year-old volunteer is at work because of 
her energy. 
</P>
<P>
 "She seems like she's in the background, " said Bryant, executive director for 
the All People's Community Center. "But really, she's in there. When she 
latches onto the project, she gets a lot of energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Navas, a Sylmar resident, won the 1993 Outstanding Community Service Award 
from the Transamerica Foundation recently. 
</P>
<P>
 The All People's Community Center is a church-supported group started in the 
1940s on East 20th Street in Downtown Los Angeles that serves the poor Latino, 
Asian and African-American communities. It is an old neighborhood where 
residents have pride in their property, but -- like other inner-city areas -- 
it also has problems with drugs and crime, Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some volunteers have been reluctant to work at the center and get flustered if 
things do not go as planned, Bryant said. But she said she has never seen that 
with Navas. "She's a natural. She's not forcing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the award to Navas, the Transamerica Foundation donated $1,000 to 
the community center, which serves about 6,000 people throughout Los Angeles 
County, including children, adults and senior citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Navas' volunteer work at the center has included running holiday parties for 
underprivileged children, reading stories to preschoolers, collecting toys and 
helping to organize a festival this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Three years ago, she dressed up as one of the Ninja Turtles characters," 
recalled Anton Harper, who organized the Christmas party and co-chaired the 
festival with Navas this year. "The party lasted for four hours and that 
costume looked pretty hot." 
</P>
<P>
 Navas filled in as Master Splinter, the oversized rat that teaches and advises 
the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, when someone else had to back out at the last 
minute. She learned a dance routine within a week. The costume thrilled some of 
the children but scared others, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them wanted to do karate chops on me," Navas said. 
</P>
<P>
 What makes her an especially good volunteer is her ability to work with 
children, those who have worked with her said. While she directs about 350 
children around the Transamerica building to get them to Christmas parties, 
logistical snags occasionally hold up the group. Then, Navas would take out a 
monkey puppet, wearing a Santa hat and Christmas scarf, and give the kids an 
impromptu performance while they waited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to be in the middle of chaos," Navas said. "I enjoy everything that 
goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of flexibility also makes her an asset, Bryant said, pointing out 
that events at the center often do not go as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 Navas' natural style also helps in her work. "Children can sense if you're 
sincere, and she's a very sincere person," Bryant said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harper added that Navas has a natural ability to persuade volunteers to do 
things they may not have planned, such as dressing up as a clown or putting on 
another costume. Other people seem to feed off her energy, he said. He also 
likes her voice when she sings Christmas carols. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's funny," Navas said about the compliment on her singing. "I was just 
yelling the words." And she downplays her own influence on other volunteers.  
</P>
<P>
 Navas, who has been married for almost four years, is expecting her first 
child in February. So she probably will not be dancing in a hot rubber rat 
costume this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably won't be as involved as I was because of the pregnancy," she said. 
"But maybe in another year."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: FLU SHOTS TO BE OFFERED AT HUNDREDS OF CLINICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN EYERLY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 200 flu shot clinics will be held this fall by the nonprofit Visiting 
Nurse Assn. of Orange County. The vaccinations will be available Sept. 24 to 
Dec. 11 at Albertson's supermarkets, and Longs and Sav-on drug stores 
throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The Visiting Nurse Assn. is also offering to hold clinics at companies with 50 
or more employees. Association spokeswoman Julie Schoen said American 
businesses lose an estimated $4 billion each year as a result of flu-related 
absences. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year was a terrible flu season," Schoen said. "I don't know if it's 
going to be worse (this season), but it could be as bad." 
</P>
<P>
 The illness can be especially hard on seniors, young children, people with 
long-term heart and lung problems, and those suffering from chronic diseases, 
Schoen said. In 1991, 20,000 deaths in the United States were attributed to 
flu, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vaccination prevents illness in about 70% of healthy children and young 
adults," association president Gordon Martin said. "It is the best way to fight 
the flu, yet only 25% to 30% take the vaccine." 
</P>
<P>
 Schoen said a shot is needed annually because an individual's immunity 
decreases over time, and because the strain of virus that causes the flu 
changes each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's goal is to administer 14,000 flu shots this season. More 
than 7,000 vaccinations were administered last season during the program's 
inaugural year. 
</P>
<P>
 The flu shots cost $10 and are offered to anyone 13 or older. Parental consent 
is required for ages 13 to 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinics will be held from 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays at participating 
Albertson's supermarkets; 10 a.m. to 3 p.m. Saturdays and Sundays at Sav-on 
drug stores; and 4 to 7 p.m. Tuesdays and Wednesdays at Longs drug stores. 
</P>
<P>

(800) 616-SHOT. ALAN EYERLY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; POLICE GOLF TOURNEY RESERVATIONS OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Registration is being accepted through Oct. 3 for the annual Brea Police 
Athletic League golf tournament. Proceeds will support local charities. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament will be Friday morning, Oct. 14, at Birch Hills Golf Course in 
Brea. 
</P>
<P>
 A traditional aspect of the community event is that participants are allowed 
to bring only three golf clubs onto the course. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not only a fun tournament, it gives people in the community a different 
view of the police," said tournament director Tom Flenniken, a sergeant with 
the Brea Police Department. He pointed out that many residents interact with 
police officers only when the police are issuing citations or taking crime 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament features cash prizes for golfers whose drives land nearest the 
pins on par three holes. Prizes will also be presented for the longest drives 
on par four holes, and for the longest successful putt on the 18th hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Entry fees are $40 per player, which includes 18 holes of golf, food and 
refreshments. The tournament is limited to 152 players. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional information is available from Flenniken at (714) 990-7609. ALAN

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA; MEASURE A OPPONENTS TO HAVE TOWN 
MEETING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rancho Santa Margarita Civic Assn. will have a town meeting tonight to 
discuss how residents can fight a November ballot initiative that asks voter 
approval to build a commercial airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7:30 p.m. meeting will be at Trabuco Mesa School, 21301 Avenida De Las 
Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 The association has joined with other South County residents to form a 
committee to defeat the ballot initiative known as Measure A. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee is called Taxpayers for Responsible Planning. 
</P>
<P>
 The group contends that converting the Marine Corps base to a commercial 
airport would hurt Rancho Santa Margarita and other nearby communities by 
increasing noise and traffic.

MORNING BRIEFING: SANDERS MIGHT BE AN ALL-PRO, BUT HE'S DEFINITELY ALL-JEWELRY

 C.W. Nevius of the San Francisco Chronicle on Deion Sanders, who shopped his 
services to several NFL teams and is expected to sign with the 49ers: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sanders is the guy who made getting dressed after a game a media event. The 
listing of his various rings, necklaces, watches and bracelets filled a good 
three paragraphs. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he used to follow that up by pulling on a pair of boxer shorts with 
green dollar signs on them, the scene was complete." 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who was USC's opponent in its first football game in 1888? 
</P>
<P>
 Count down: Fight doctor Ferdie Pacheco was asked to comment on whether Julio 
Cesar Chavez, who meets Meldrick Taylor on Saturday night in a pay-per-view 
bout at the MGM Grand hotel in Las Vegas, should continue to fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're asking the wrong guy," he said. "My opinion is get out while you have 
all your brains all together and your money and, as Joe Bugner put it, the 
ability to count it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurassic Park: Bill Lyon of the Philadelphia Inquirer remembering feared 
linebacker Dick Butkus of the Chicago Bears: 
</P>
<P>
 "His eyes would congeal into dark, beady, predatorial slits. Bent, bow-legged, 
with knuckles all but dragging along the ground, he looked positively primal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was either going to stuff a running back, or club a T-Rex." 
</P>
<P>
 Intrigue: Dan Patrick, ESPN announcer, on his colleague, Keith Olbermann: 
</P>
<P>
 "I still view him as the weird guy in the basement with a chemistry set. I 
don't want to go down there to see what he's doing, but I know he's up to 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie who? Ernie Banks, a Hall of Fame player with the Chicago Cubs, along 
with a friend, wanted to see a home Michael Jordan is building in a Chicago 
suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, a security guard didn't recognize "Mr. Cub," even though he 
played 18 years for the team, made 11 All-Star teams and hit 512 home runs. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, he didn't know me," Banks told Steve Rosenbloom of the Chicago Sun-Times. 
"I've been in the Vatican and White House, but I couldn't get in to see 
(Jordan's) house." 
</P>
<P>
 Fixer upper? The Seattle Kingdome won't be available to the NFL Seahawks until 
Nov. 1 because of repairs being made to the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 Club President Ken Behring initially called the Kingdome an Edsel, then 
backtracked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would apologize to an Edsel," he said. "We have a building here that was 
never well designed, that was never well built and was poorly maintained from 
day one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plus, it's downright homely. It was outdated at the time it was built."

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; AILING JOHNSON ONLY WATCHES PRACTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By EARL GUSTKEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rob Johnson is the latest to join the injured on USC's pass offense. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior quarterback aggravated a sore back in the Penn State game.Johnson 
was suited up at practice Wednesday, but took no snaps. Instead, backups Brad 
Otton and Matt Koffler did all the throwing. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting wide receivers Ed Hervey and Keyshawn Johnson, who did not play 
against Penn State, did not practice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive end Elic Mahone and tight end John Allred turned ankles Wednesday, 
and had to leave practice. Both were expected to be ready by USC's next game, 
Sept. 24, against Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor (2-0), which plays at Oklahoma State (1-0) on Saturday before visiting 
USC, is led by a true freshman quarterback, Jeff Watson. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered one of the best Texas high school quarterback recruits last year, 
Watson (six feet, 205 pounds) has led eight touchdown drives in two games, 
thrown three touchdown passes and no interceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 And he isn't the only standout freshman on offense. Of Baylor's 792 yards in 
total offense so far, 460 were accounted for by freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor defeated San Jose State on Saturday, 54-20, getting six sacks. San Jose 
had a minus 22 yards rushing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of old Trojans weren't happy with USC's 38-14 drubbing at Penn State, 
and one of them was Willie McGinest, last season's defensive end who plays for 
the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Willie called me at home and wanted to know what happened back there," said 
USC wide receiver Ken Grace, McGinest's friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was really upset. But the reason was, there (are) five Penn State guys on 
the Patriots. Willie had made a bet with them. He has to wear a Penn State hat 
and T-shirt all week." EARL GUSTKEY

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI; FLORIDA HIT SERIES 'SEVENTYSOMETHING' 
TOPS RATINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GENE WOJCIECHOWSKI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Those weren't game films Kentucky defensive coordinator Mike Archer watched a 
few days ago, they were sci-fi flicks. Mere humans couldn't do what Florida did 
to the Wildcats last Saturday, or to New Mexico State the week before. 
</P>
<P>
 Since when does a team open with 70-21 and 73-7 victories against Division I-A 
programs and not be a member of the AFC East, or accused of sharing 
performance-enhancers with the Chinese women's swim team? 
</P>
<P>
 Florida did it--win big, that is--which is why the Gators are the new No. 1 in 
the Associated Press poll, passing Nebraska to get there. 
</P>
<P>
 So overpowering were the Gators in Gainesville that they probably could have 
beaten Kentucky in street clothes. A year ago, Florida needed a last-minute 
touchdown to defeat the Wildcats. This time it could have quit after the first 
quarter and still won, 14-7. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first possession of the game we go on the field and their offense goes 
three (downs) and out," Archer said. "I'm saying to myself, 'This is going to 
be like last year's game. It's going to be a nail-biter.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Florida scored on its next five possessions and barely broke a sweat 
doing it. During one stretch, the Gators scored 52 unanswered points. 
</P>
<P>
 Archer could have been treated for shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, they've got my vote for No. 1," he said. "I don't know if anybody 
else can match up with them speed-wise and ability-wise." 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons? Let Archer and Kentucky Coach Bill Curry count the ways: 
</P>
<P>
 1--A five-wide receiver scheme that Curry said "is unusual at our level." And 
according to Curry, each one of the Gator receivers is as good as the next. 
</P>
<P>
 2--A rushing attack led by redshirt freshmen tailbacks Elijah Williams and 
Tyrone Baker and true freshman Fred Taylor. "They're probably going to be 
better than Errict Rhett," Archer said of the former Florida star who finished 
his career last season as the Southeastern Conference's third all-time leading 
rusher, behind Herschel Walker and Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
 3--A quirky substitution pattern and a clever no-huddle offense of sorts, all 
devised by Coach Steve Spurrier to create last-moment matchup problems. 
</P>
<P>
 4--A quarterback who doesn't miss: senior Terry Dean, who Archer said is much 
improved from a shaky junior season. 
</P>
<P>
 5--A defense so good that Curry said, "It doesn't have a visible flaw." 
Archer, who singled out defensive tackle Ellis Johnson and defensive end Kevin 
Carter, said the Gators "are probably better on defense than they are on 
offense. That's a scary thought." THE TEAM THAT ATE COLLEGE FOOTBALL--PART II 
</P>
<P>
 None of this stuff about Florida is news to New Mexico State Coach Jim Hess, 
whose Aggies earned $600,000 of sacrificial lamb money for playing the Gators 
and Arizona in the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Hess could have told Kentucky's coaches all about the Gators' wholesale 
substitutions and maybe offered some advice about those 30 formations he saw, 
some of them with that five-wide receiver set. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, nobody called. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just figured it was New Mexico State, that we weren't worth (anything)," 
Hess said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hess acknowledged that the Aggies probably had no business playing Florida. 
But New Mexico State needed the money, so the Aggies became Gator bait. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in their league," Hess said. "We're a lower Division I-A school." 
</P>
<P>
 No need to apologize. Kentucky is in Florida's league--the SEC--but you 
wouldn't have known it Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were sensational and we were awful," Curry said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Gators travel to Knoxville for Saturday's game against 15th-ranked 
Tennessee, a team that has beaten Florida 10 of the last 13 times at Neyland 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's how much that swayed everyone's thinking: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd have to take Florida," said Hess, who added that Volunteer coaches have 
yet to call, either. "I'm anxious to see it. If they score in the 50s against 
Tennessee, then, my goodness." 
</P>
<P>
 And this from Archer: "My personal gut feeling? Yeah, I think (Florida) will 
beat them." 
</P>
<P>
 Curry was more diplomatic. Or maybe it was shellshock. Anyway, he said the 
Gators "have a chance" to be a great football team. How great wouldn't be 
determined until they faced another great team--and it wasn't Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Curry's choice? "Florida State," he said of the Nov. 26 game at Tallahassee. 
POLLS WITH AN ASTERISK 
</P>
<P>
 Someone has been sipping on too much Appalachian moonshine these days. How 
else do you explain West Virginia (0-2) getting eight votes in this week's AP 
poll, good enough for 38th place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did my wife vote?" said Mountaineer Coach Don Nehlen, whose team has lost to 
Nebraska and Rutgers. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the ghost of Corky Simpson is alive and well this season, thanks to 
some knucklehead who awarded unimpressive but undefeated Alabama a first-place 
vote. The Crimson Tide (2-0), which actually got booed at home in last 
Saturday's 17-7 victory over lowly Vanderbilt, is lucky to be ranked No. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't blame Simpson. The Tucson Citizen columnist who picked Alabama No. 1 
from start to finish in 1992 no longer votes in the AP poll. MAD TO THE BONE 
</P>
<P>
 Kids and Iowa State Coach Jim Walden say the darndest things. 
</P>
<P>
 This time Walden, who is oh-for-Iowa in 1994 (losses to Iowa and Division I-AA 
Northern Iowa), lashed out at critics for attacking his program and the players 
in it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to function in a positive fashion when everybody's telling you 
you're a bum," Walden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Walden is no bum, but his 28-49-2 record at Iowa State (one winning season in 
seven years) has landed him on the list of coaches whose job status might be in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Walden's response: "Sticks and stones will break my bones, but words will just 
bore me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what people don't understand is that when you're taking quotes from 
over the phone and putting them in newspapers it's slut journalism to start 
with, and secondly, you're paying someone else to do your slutty work. But 
that's the symptom of society today. So there's no need to worry about that. I 
can handle it. . . . It's not me. But what happens is, you can call me a bum if 
you want to, but people act like our players aren't affected by that. 
</P>
<P>
 "If certain people out there in this world feel better about saying something 
bad about a football coach, if that makes your day or makes you feel better, 
then they're going to say it. It's a shame because young college kids shouldn't 
have to put up with that." THE REST 
</P>
<P>
 How upset was new Notre Dame defensive coordinator Bob Davie about Michigan's 
last-minute drive that set up the game-winning field goal? Upset enough to call 
Irish Coach Lou Holtz three times Saturday night and meet with him informally 
twice on Sunday morning and another time during the coaching staff's regular 
meeting. You would too if you were Notre Dame's fourth defensive coordinator in 
the last six seasons. . . . As pregame festivities go, perhaps it wasn't the 
smartest idea for Arizona State to plant a Sun Devil flag in front of the Miami 
bench. The Hurricanes--either annoyed by the stunt or simply upset that they 
hadn't thought of it first--defeated Arizona State, 47-10. "To me, that's not a 
wise decision by the opponent to taunt us or do whatever they were trying to 
do," Miami Coach Dennis Erickson said. The fifth-ranked Hurricanes have two 
weeks to prepare for No. 19 Washington, which also has a week off before 
traveling to the Orange Bowl and a crack at Miami's 58-game home victory 
streak. . . . As best as Big Eight Conference officials can determine, this is 
the first time Kansas State and Kansas have been ranked in the same poll. The 
Wildcats are 21st in the coaches' poll, the Jayhawks No. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 If Michigan's Tyrone Wheatley, UCLA's J.J. Stokes and USC's Rob Johnson want 
to join the Heisman Trophy race, they had better hurry. The early leaders: 
1--Washington running back Napoleon Kaufman, 2--Florida quarterback Terry Dean, 
3--Nebraska quarterback Tommie Frazier, 4--Penn State running back Ki-Jana 
Carter, 5--tie: Notre Dame quarterback Ron Powlus, Michigan quarterback Todd 
Collins. Honorable mention: Alcorn State quarterback Steve McNair. . . . Here's 
how bad it is at Missouri: Houston Coach Kim Helton, whose team is 0-2, has 
guaranteed a victory against the similarly winless Tigers. Former USC Coach 
Larry Smith, in charge of rebuilding the Missouri program, wasn't in the mood 
to match wagers. Back in August Smith said the Tigers needed to win two of 
their first four games. They've lost to Tulsa, were crushed by Illinois (one 
first down, with 3:41 remaining, with Illinois' second- and third-teamers on 
defense) and now get Houston on the road, followed by West Virginia at home. 
Says Smith: "You can't squeeze orange juice out of a turnip, we all know that." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Michigan defeated Notre Dame, Holtz was considering what his 
national championship chances might be with a single loss. "I am not sure if we 
won 15, if we would be a legitimate (contender)," he said, taking a 
good-natured jab at everyone who voted for Florida State last season. "I think 
you can lose early in the year and still come back, if you lose to a good 
opponent, normal circumstances would (hold). Does this hold true for Notre 
Dame? I don't know. Would it hold true for a Big Ten team? I don't know. It 
certainly holds true for a southern team and it has in the past. But it seems 
like once a team loses up north, they are just sort of put on hold." Wrong. 
Notre Dame won the 1977 national title, despite an early regular-season loss to 
Mississippi, and Penn State won in 1982, despite a loss to Alabama. And it 
might not be north proper, but Colorado shared a title in 1990, despite an 
11-1-1 record. The Top 10

 Beuerlein started 14 games last season and set a franchise record with 61.7%

CAL STATE FULLERTON NOTEBOOK / LON EUBANKS: DESPITE NEW FACES, TITAN BASEBALL 
SHOULD STILL BE A BIG HIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Dante Powell and Jeff Ferguson have departed for pro baseball. So have 
pitchers Dan Ricabal and Mike Parisi. But the beat goes on at Cal State 
Fullerton, where the Titans are regrouping after last season's NCAA regional 
championship and College World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans will have 18 new faces, either high school recruits or college 
transfers, when the team starts fall session workouts Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest name among the newcomers is outfielder C.J. Ankrum of Saratoga. He 
was drafted in the ninth round by the Dodgers but decided to delay his pro 
career to play for the Titans. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably the highest profile of the new players," said George Horton, 
the Titans' associate head coach. "We think he has a chance to become one of 
the best hitters in college baseball right away. 
</P>
<P>
 "He hit over .650 and had 15 home runs during his senior season. He also hit 
well in all-star games against the toughest competition available, so we think 
he'll make the jump pretty easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Two other recruits were drafted in the late rounds. Outfielder Matt Kastelic 
of Orange played for Rancho Santiago last season and was picked in the 42nd 
round by Philadelphia. Second baseman Nakia Hill of San Diego Crawford went in 
the 46th round to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other players who committed to Fullerton, however, decided to sign pro 
contracts. Pitcher Derrin Ebert of Hesperia High signed with Atlanta, and Randy 
Vickers of Glendale College went with Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 The newcomers include seven pitchers. Six of them have pitched either at 
community colleges or at four-year schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the transfers is Todd Singelyn, who was at Arizona two years after 
playing in high school at Whittier. "He didn't have a great season last year at 
Arizona for whatever reason, but he had a good summer in the Cape Cod League 
with an ERA around 2.90," Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other new pitchers are Tom Dixon, a transfer from Arkansas Little Rock, Steve 
Cardona of Delta College in Stockton, Mark Chavez of Harbor College, Tom Dillon 
of College of Marin (Calif.) and Danny Reeser of Long Beach College. Chavez and 
Dillon were All-State community college players. The seventh new pitcher, Scott 
Hild, played last season for Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Wagner is the lone returning starting pitcher, although highly regarded 
relief pitcher Ted Silva also is back. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to have someone emerge from among that group of new pitchers," Horton 
said. "But we think the possibilities of that happening are pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Brian Loyd is expected to replace Bret Hemphill at catcher, but two 
high school recruits, Mike Brambilla of Brea-Olinda and Mike Wright of San Jose 
Bellarmine Prep will be challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 Other recruits include infielders Joe Fraser of Huntington Beach and Rancho 
Santiago College, Ruben Hernandez of Cal Baptist, and David Pruett of Diablo 
Valley College. 
</P>
<P>
 The other new outfielders are Steve Chatham of Vista High, Skip Kiil of Merced 
College and Ted Persell of East Los Angeles College. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Dante and Fergie came in, we were sure they were going to be impact 
players right away," Horton said. "But there are quite a few guys among this 
group who can go either way. It appears to be a good group as a whole, though." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 John Easterbrook attended his first Fullerton sports event as the university's 
newly appointed athletic director last weekend when the Titan soccer team 
played in a tournament at Fresno State, where Easterbrook has been the senior 
associate athletic director for nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been kidding our events person all week about making sure the box for 
the visiting athletic director in the stadium was in good shape for the 
weekend," Easterbrook said. "I told him we wanted nothing but the best for this 
guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Easterbrook won't officially begin work at Fullerton until Sept. 20. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really looking forward to getting down there, but there's been a lot I've 
had to do to finish up here," Easterbrook said by telephone from Fresno. "Until 
they can hire someone to replace me, there will be three people in the 
department sharing my job on an interim basis, and I've had to go over quite a 
few things with each of them, as well as take care of the normal things 
associated with a move." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Titan soccer team tied Seattle Pacific, 2-2, and defeated Illinois State, 
3-1, in the Gold Rush Tournament at Fresno State, and Coach Al Mistri remains 
encouraged on the heels of the 2-1-1 showing in the first two weeks of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seattle Pacific is the defending national champion in Division II, so we knew 
they were a good team," Mistri said. "But we had enough scoring chances against 
them to win three games, much less one." 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri was pleased with the play of Demian Brown and Eddie Soto, in 
particular, and he felt freshman Joey Franchino continued to make a good early 
impression. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has been pleased with Mike Kornock's early play as the replacement for 
graduated star Mike Ammann. "Talk about pressure, replacing someone like Mike, 
but he's done admirably," Mistri said. Kornock has had six goals against him, 
but has seven saves in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 The Titans, ranked 15th in the nation in this week's Soccer America rankings, 
play in the Reebok Invitational at Burlington, Vt., this weekend against New 
Hampshire and Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 Titan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Dante Powell, now with the San Francisco Giants, had a sparkling first season 
in pro baseball. Playing for Everett, Wash., in the Class A rookie league, 
Powell hit .309 with 51 hits in 165 at-bats for 41 games. He had five home runs 
and 25 runs batted in. He stole 27 bases in 28 attempts. He was called up late 
in the season to San Jose in the California League, where he had two hits in 
four at-bats. Powell was back on the Fullerton campus Monday and said he plans 
to play in the Arizona Instructional League. . . . Former Titan Mike Parisi was 
chosen as the Florida Marlins' minor league pitcher of the month for August. 
Parisi was 4-1 with an 1.86 earned-run average in six starts during the month. 
He finished his first pro season with a 5-5 record and 2.99 ERA, recovering 
from a slow start.

<P>
 1993: 21-8 overall, 7-0 in the Sunset League; lost to Whittier La Serna, 10-9, 
in overtime in quarterfinals of Division II playoffs. 
</P>

 Key returners: David Cramp, driver, Jr.; Brian Heifferon, utility, Sr.; Bill

Chris Hamme, two-meter man, So.; Brandon Joffe, two-meter man, So.; Eric Kim,

</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Sprague, who led Sunny Hills to 12 Southern Section title games, has 
another team that should challenge for a championship. The Friars, ranked No. 1 
in the Division II preseason poll, feature three of the top players in the 
county: Heifferon, Mattivi and Smith, who each work out with the U.S. junior 
national team. Sprague says Heifferon is the best defensive player he has ever 
coached. Mattivi is an athletic lefty who plays and guards two meters well. 
Some say Smith might be the best offensive player in the section.

<P>
 Outlook: The Knights won't be as big and strong as they were last season when 
they were led by David Hay, who is now at Stanford, but they should still be 
formidable. Most of this team helped SoCal win the national 15-and-under Junior 
Olympic title this summer, so they are competition-tested. Brian Brown and 
Pflueger, who started as a freshman, are the top players, and Arroyo, brother 
of Villa Park high standout and U.S. national team member Gavin Arroyo, has 
quickly made his presence known and will start.

1994 PREP PREVIEW: WATER POLO; MISSION VIEJO HAS SHOT AT PLAYOFFS WITH WOMACK 
BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Womack is doing his best to show there is more to Mission Viejo 
aquatics than swimming and diving. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want prove to everyone that we can play water polo, too," said Womack, a 
senior goalkeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a tough sell -- the Diablo boys' swim team has won 16 Southern Section 
titles in the last 19 years; the water polo team hasn't reached the playoffs 
since 1989 -- but Womack and his teammates made great progress last season. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 7, the Diablos started the South Coast League season by upsetting 
Capistrano Valley, 4-3, in overtime. At the time, Capistrano Valley was ranked 
No. 4 in the Southern Section Division I, and with the victory, the Diablos 
started thinking about making the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 But early the next morning, disaster struck. During a conditioning drill, 
Womack dived into the pool, hit a lane line with his head and broke a bone in 
his neck. The injury, which didn't appear to be serious at first, kept Womack 
out of school a month and a half and in a neck brace for three. 
</P>
<P>
 The team suffered without Womack in goal, losing three of its final four 
league games, finishing fourth and again missing the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a team, I don't think we really ever recovered from that," Mission Viejo 
Coach Ron Osumi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Womack recovered well enough to be back in the pool in February. By May, he 
was finishing first in the 500 freestyle, the 200 individual medley and two 
relays at the junior varsity league finals. 
</P>
<P>
 He was back in goal before school let out for the summer and now is leading 
Mission Viejo into another season. Again, the team has the potential to make 
the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Womack says he has adjusted to playing again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty scary the first time I got into the goal," he said. "I was 
flinching at every shot. I still have doubts occasionally, but I know I can do 
it. There's really not too much danger of getting hurt again." 
</P>
<P>
 That he was hurt in the first place was a fluke. The Diablos were swimming a 
relay drill that involved players pulling themselves out of the water, touching 
a wall on the pool deck and jumping back in the pool to swim in the other 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one else was diving," Osumi said. "But Charlie is pretty competitive. I 
guess he was trying to go a little farther and misjudged where the lane line 
was."

 When Womack came up, his head was bleeding, but there was no indication that 
it was an especially serious injury. Several teammates, including his close 
friend Russell Rowlands, volunteered to take Womack to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought we were going to take him down to the hospital and get a few quick 
stitches and go back to school," Rowlands said. 
</P>
<P>
 Emergency room personnel stitched up the cut, and Womack was about to leave 
the hospital when he mentioned a tingling sensation. 
</P>
<P>
 Instantly, the head wound became secondary. X-rays showed that one of the 
vertebra in his neck had burst. Part of the broken bone was pressing against 
his spinal cord. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgery was scheduled for Monday and during the weekend Womack was put in 
traction, his head bolted to a contraption that made sure his spinal cord 
remained uninjured. Teammates and friends visited, trying to cheer him up, 
bringing compact discs, videos, flowers and even the film of the victory over 
Capistrano Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to do anything we could to keep his spirits up," Rowlands said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the five-hour surgery, doctors removed pieces of broken bones and 
reconstructed the vertebra with bone they removed from his hip. 
</P>
<P>
 The surgery was successful but doctors weren't certain of his prognosis for 
recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was scary throughout," said Charles Womack Sr. "We were not sure what was 
going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But the brace came off in early January, and about a month later Womack took 
his first tentative laps in the pool. By June he was playing water polo again. 
</P>
<P>
 Osumi says that's not good news for the rest of the South Coast League. At 5 
feet 8, Womack is a foot shorter than San Clemente goalkeeper Gabe Gardner, but 
Osumi says Womack is quick and knows the angles. 
</P>
<P>
 "You put him back in there with our team and a lot of things are going to go 
our way," Osumi said. "It's not easy to get the ball past him." Water Polo at a

 Notes: Two years after realigning to add a fourth water polo division, the 
Southern Section has added two more for this season. Division I is unchanged 
with the Century, Mission, Moore, Sea View and South Coast leagues, but 
Division II is now entirely made up of Orange County leagues. The Garden Grove 
League moves up from Division IV, making it highly unlikely that Los Amigos 
will advance to a third consecutive championship game. The Orange League, which 
moves from Division III to VI, is the only county league competing at other 
than Division I or II. El Toro Coach Don Stoll said most local coaches aren't 
happy with the change. "I think it waters down the importance of the section 
championships," Stoll said. "If everybody in the class gets an A, why study?" . 
. . San Clemente Coach Steve Yancey on Servite's Jeremy Smith: "He is just 
phenomenal. If you don't run a defense strictly to shut him down, you are 
making a big mistake."

 Outlook: Wright, who led the freshman-sophomore team to three consecutive

lineup is back from the Orange League co-championship team, and the Wildcats 
lost only two games -- to Corona del Mar and Foothill -- this summer. Matthews, 
a 6-foot-4, 220-pound hole man, leads a balanced attack.

</P>
<P>
 Outlook: Vargas has led teams to four Southern Section championships, but the 
Sea Kings haven't won since 1989. "It's depressing," Vargas said, only 
half-joking. This season could provide medication. After coming agonizingly 
close to the title last season, Corona del Mar is the consensus team to beat. 
Crosby Grant has moved on to Stanford, but the other six starters return. Palda 
and Hueston are two of the premier players in the county, and Buzolich and 
McFarland, both 6-3, aren't far behind. Jetton is outstanding in the goal.

 Outlook: San Clemente hasn't won a South Coast League title since 1990, but 
with El Toro moving to the Sea View League, a title this year should be fairly 
easy for the Tritons. But Yancey isn't ordering the banner yet. "I have to hope 
that what everybody is saying and touting for our season plays out," he said. 
"But I'm a here-and-now person and I want to win here and now." It's an 
experienced, talented team, led by Sam Bailey, a third-team All-Division I 
selection, and Gardner, who at 6 feet 8 is the most imposing goalkeeper in the 
section.

DUCKS TIE THE SHARKS; GOALIE BATTLE TIGHTENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Guy Hebert is still the only Mighty Duck with his ESPN Sports Center fantasy 
highlight, but he has competition for the Ducks' No. 1 goaltending job. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikhail Shtalenkov played all the way in the Ducks' 1-1 tie with San Jose in 
an exhibition game Wednesday night at McNichols Arena, and the goal he allowed 
was one Coach Ron Wilson would have questioned if there had been video-replay 
capability here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I respect Mike (Shtalenkov) as much as I do Guy," Wilson said. "Whoever plays 
best will be in there. Mike established himself last year and from here out, 
they'll be alternated to see who starts opening night." 
</P>
<P>
 That will be exasperating news to Hebert, who was 20-27-3 last season with a 
2.83 goals-against average and a .907 save percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 He won the last battle he was in when Ron Tugnutt was traded to Montreal. But 
no sooner was the No. 1 job his than Shtalenkov got a foot in the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov appeared in 10 games, and had a 2.65 goals-against average and a 
.909 save percentage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be great for me, but it's difficult to be a No. 1 goalie," 
Shtalenkov said. "It's a long season. It's good for the Ducks, we need two 
goalies. I hope we could do the job together, (between me and) Guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Hebert played a period and a half Tuesday against Dallas in his only 
exhibition appearance, allowing one goal on 21 shots, and went home Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shtalenkov has allowed two goals while facing 46 shots in two appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Baker scored the game-tying goal for the Sharks 35 seconds into the 
third period, with the Ducks protesting that the net had been dislodged before 
the puck entered it. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Douris gave the Ducks a 1-0 lead at 3:57 with an assist from Jean 
Francois Jomphe. 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie Paul Kariya was held pointless but found considerably more open ice 
than in his debut Tuesday. He had some near breakaways and repeatedly set up 
scoring chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "A couple of people weren't ready when he made plays," Wilson said. "We don't 
want them to watch a highlight film, but be a part of it." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a more wide-open game," Kariya said. "The puck wasn't bouncing today, 
but some days that's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, now 0-2-1 in exhibition games, play their first home exhibition 
Sunday against Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Duck Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Garry Valk, who underwent an emergency appendectomy last month, played his 
first game of the exhibition season. "It's just a matter of getting stronger. I 
was in the hospital basically for a week," he said. "As the game went on I felt 
a little better." . . . The Ducks haven't beaten the Sharks since an exhibition 
game last October, going 0-6 in the regular season. Both teams had about half 
their regular lineups Wednesday. "We wanted to win and establish something," 
Wilson said.

CASTRO, SPLASH RALLY TO REACH SEMIFINALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They don't call Rod Castro "The Rocket" for nothing, but a new nickname might 
be more apropos. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Heimlich. 
</P>
<P>
 As in Heimlich Maneuver. 
</P>
<P>
 Castro's game-winning goal in overtime prevented the Splash from choking away 
a three-goal lead and the first round of the Continental Indoor Soccer League 
series. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash scored a 5-4 victory over Sacramento in front of 5,773 at The Pond 
after a fourth-quarter meltdown in which it watched a three-goal lead go poof. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash open the CISL semifinals against Las Vegas at 7:35 p.m. Friday at 
The Pond. Las Vegas beat San Diego, 6-5, also in overtime. It, too, will be a 
three-game series. Game 2 will be played Saturday at the Thomas & Mack Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to have someone step up because of the way we were playing -- we got 
stale," Splash defender Ralph Black said. "It took the individual brilliance of 
Rod Castro." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro scored on a move that the Knights had taken away from the Splash 
forwards throughout the series. In fact, Dale Ervine was zero for 30 shooting, 
and Raffaele Ruotolo was one for 24. They were 1-2 on the team in both goals 
and assists during the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 But Castro started from the left, escaped the tug on the shirt of Ricky Villa, 
and managed to turn the corner against Lucas Martin. Called The Rocket because 
of his powerful shot, it zoomed past goalie Mike Dowler and sent Splash players 
into hysterics. 
</P>
<P>
 For Dowler, who had 39 saves in three games and was brilliant throughout, it 
was a tough way to end a career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what (Martin) was thinking," Castro said, "but he was giving me 
a little space. I could tell he was respecting me a little bit and I took 
advantage of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro had made the same move on Martin in Game 2 and scored an 8-5 victory. 
But Castro was the only Splash player to execute the move against the 
Sacramento defense, which clogged the area in front of the net and challenged 
the Splash to fire away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it was a great first-round series," Splash Coach George Fernandez 
said. "They made us play under pressure and made us mentally prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 After spotting Sacramento a 1-0 lead 2 minutes 33 seconds into the game, the 
Splash scored four consecutive goals. Ruotolo, Doug Neely, Shane Hickson and 
Jaime Francisco scored. Ervine had two assists, while Ruotolo and Hickson had 
one. Hickson also assisted on the game-winner. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Ervine and Ruotolo's first points of the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Splash defender Paul McDonnell had a chance to win it in regulation, but 
missed a virtually open-net shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never think you're going to lose in overtime," Castro said. "I told 
myself, 'I'm going to win the game,' and I hope everyone on the team was 
thinking the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Splash defender Paul McDonnell, a former Troy High School and Cal State 
Fullerton standout, was named to the 1994 CISL all-rookie first team. The 
defender had 14 goals, 13 assists and blocked 29 shots during the regular 
season. Joining McDonnell on the all-rookie team are Pittsburgh goalie Doug 
Petras, San Diego forward John Olo Molomo, Washington forward Dante Washington, 
Las Vegas midfielder Dan Barber and Monterrey defender Genoni Martinez.

 With Costa Mesa leading, 9-8, Saddleback's No. 2 singles player, Suzanne 
Nguyen, won her final set, 6-3, to tie the match at nine, resulting in a 
Roadrunner victory in games, 83-67, at Costa Mesa. Saddleback is 1-0; Costa 
Mesa 0-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew we had them in games because of Cyndi (Cao), so I was just hoping 
Suzanne could win the final set," Saddleback Coach Mike Conover said.

<P>
 Ruben Vaughan has been cleared to play football this week for Foothill, Coach 
Tom Meiss said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan, a 15-year-old freshman, was set to attend Santa Margarita but was 
severely beaten during an attack in Portola Hills in August. The incident, 
which his stepfather Melvin Aaron alleges was racially motivated, led the 
family to enroll Vaughan at Foothill. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan suffered a broken jaw, nose and several stab wounds, but he practiced 
in full pads with the Foothill team Monday. He is expected to play in the 
Knights' game Friday against Woodbridge. CHRIS FOSTER

<TEXT>
<P>
 For those who have already decided that top-ranked Corona del Mar is the 
dominant team in Southern Section Division I water polo, Newport Harbor Coach 
Bill Barnett believes there's another team just as talented. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnett became convinced after Long Beach Wilson, ranked second in Division I, 
pounded the seventh-ranked Sailors, 16-7, in a nonleague season-opener 
Wednesday at Newport Harbor High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they'll give Corona del Mar a battle for the championship," Barnett 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins got help from the high-scoring tandem of Adam Wright and Pat 
Cochran, and goalkeeper Nick Hill limited Newport Harbor to one second-half 
goal.

FIRST PERSON: SMOKER'S FANTASIES LIGHT UP HIS WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARRY ABRAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Abrams, a former Times staff writer, is 
writing a novel in which many of the characters smoke while Los Angeles burns. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a smoker, I have a fantasy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the small hours I sneak into the nonsmoking Clinton White House, a sackful 
of cigarettes slung over my shoulder. Like a Santa Claus from an evil parallel 
universe, I nimbly evade all security measures and leave a pack of smokes on 
the desk of each staffer -- two packs for those under threat of investigation. 
In a fit of generosity, I give Bill and Hillary a carton each. 
</P>
<P>
 My seditious deed soon bears fruit. After discovering their gifts, everybody 
decides to try just one, even the First Couple, who figure they don't have much 
to lose. Bill inhales -- and likes it. Within a week Hillary is up to three 
packs of unfiltered coffin nails a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff follows suit, and carcinogens speedily befoul the once-pure White 
House air. Of course, the press chomps itself into a feeding frenzy over the 
sinister emergence of nicotine fiends in the control room of the world's 
greatest cigarette-bashing democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 But the furor soon subsides. Why? Because for the first time in years, the 
people in the White House can think straight. 
</P>
<P>
 The First Lady proposes a brilliant solution to the health-care reform 
deadlock. Faster than you can say Whitewater, the President quickly resolves 
the crises in Cuba and Haiti, erases the federal deficit, crafts an effective 
foreign policy, and earns the respect of Bob Dole and Paula Jones. Soon, anyone 
who matters in Washington is a smoker and a genius. True, death rates from lung 
disease skyrocket inside the Beltway, but the rest of the country is more than 
willing to pay the price. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, I know this scenario is a millimeter or two far-fetched. Yet it 
illustrates why, despite this summer's escalation of the war on smoking, I 
continue to smoke. Namely, and I don't care what the shrinks are saying this 
week on "The Oprah Winfrey Show," there are moments when nothing beats a 
cigarette. In times of stress, loneliness, fear and anger, its calming, 
focusing power is only a lighter click away. It is good, cheap, albeit widely 
condemned, therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 I discovered some time ago that firing up a smoke forces me to think more 
rationally and cope better, if only briefly, with insults to my pride, my 
wallet, my temper, not to mention my life. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the great things about living in Los Angeles is that the city of O.J. 
and Heidi gives me plenty of excuses to smoke the noxious weed. 
</P>
<P>
 I smoked a lot during the 1992 riots, especially on the freeways, where I 
worried about other people's driving as well as about chances that a random 
bullet might forever plug my urge to have another cigarette. As I smoked, I 
lived, I decided in irrefutable smokers' logic. (Note: Sudden, random danger 
remains a terrific justification for smoking in Los Angeles.) 
</P>
<P>
 January's earthquake was good for a few days of nonstop puffing too. After the 
shaking had stopped, with my family unharmed, I remember thinking I had two 
choices: I could go back to sleep, which was pretty tempting, or I could get up 
and have a cigarette after I cleaned up the broken glass from a fallen picture. 
I chose the latter. And I still remember that cigarette. My wife and daughter 
and I had survived yet another California cataclysm, I thought as I reverently 
lit up. What a great smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 On a lesser scale, I deal with everyday aggravations with dollops of nicotine. 
Earlier this year, for instance, a literary agent rejected my manuscript partly 
because some of its characters smoked too much. Even in the Nyet '90s I was 
shocked by this critique. After a couple of cigarettes, though, I had overcome 
my baser instincts and returned to my usual amiable, non-serial killer self. 
Eight months later, I still haven't written the agent an angry letter, and I'm 
proud of my restraint. Meanwhile, the characters are still tucked in their 
pages, chain-smoking while they await resurrection in a better, more tolerant 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 I am not the only subscriber to smoking as a palliative against danger and 
disappointment, by the way. I recently read letters a doctor wrote from a 
Rwandan field hospital. He reported that he and other staffers were ripping 
through as many as four packs a day while working in appalling conditions that 
included threats from machete-wielding thugs. I understand completely. 
</P>
<P>
 I read that relatives sometimes place burning cigarettes on the graves of 
Balkan war casualties, a centuries-old custom, as remembrances of what the dead 
enjoyed in life. The account said a mother and her daughter-in-law lit up after 
placing the cigarettes on the grave of their son and husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, my empathy for them was less than for the doctor. But it does show 
that people actually enjoy smoking, impossible as this may seem to some in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 In my case, mornings are tobacco heaven. As I sit on my patio fumbling with 
the newspaper, I have a few glugs of coffee and think, "Is it time to light up 
yet?" The question is important because I want to be alert enough to savor 
those first puffs. If I start too soon, the perfect coffee-cigarette balance 
will be ruined. Instead of being wafted into wakefulness by carefully 
administered doses of caffeine and nicotine, I will be catapulted rudely into 
the day, like a Metro Rail train slamming into yet another car. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, I can already hear the tut-tutting and fulminating over the poor tobacco 
addict. In fact, I left last night for six months in a remote country with 
lousy phones and worse mail service to dodge the calls and letters that surely 
will come my way. If there's one thing I don't need, it's more sanctimony from 
health totalitarians. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, smokers have accepted a lot from nonsmokers. With our habit 
banned from the workplace, public buildings and airplanes, we have quelled our 
cravings until we could stumble to a designated area and apply a shaky flame to 
the business end of a cigarette. I suspect that many of us are grateful for 
this segregation, at least at work. It allows us to get up from our desks and 
go outside while our nonsmoking co-workers continue to slave away at their 
computers, running God knows what risk of repetitive stress injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the minor reasons I persist in smoking stems from the smugness of the 
clean-lung crusaders. I hate being told what to do by the self-righteous. Many 
anti-smoking zealots strike me as pompous twits. Nothing is easier or safer 
than railing against tobacco, now vilified in language once reserved for 
cocaine and heroin. As far as I know, the number of gunned-down anti-smoking 
activists remains quite small. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, that could soon change. Recently, demonstrators in Kentucky burned 
an effigy of Hillary Rodham Clinton in protest of the federal government's 
campaign against the brown leaf. It was a futile gesture, but it indicates that 
a few folks in the tobacco-growing belt are feeling militant. 
</P>
<P>
 They are, of course, destined for defeat. Sooner or later, I think tobacco 
will be outlawed. And that would not necessarily be bad. After 25 years of 
smoking, I think about quitting a lot. Day by day I find my romance with 
cigarettes fading. I have promised my wife and daughter that I will quit and it 
is getting harder to put it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Every smoker, I think, experiences moments of dreadful recognition like the 
one described below. The passage is taken from "Dead Meat" (Mysterious Press), 
Philip Kerr's recent novel about organized crime and chain-smoking in Russia: 
</P>
<P>
 Grushko's eyes noted how the fingernails on Kornilov's right hand were so 
badly stained with nicotine they looked as if they were made of wood. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Kornilov lit one of the Boyars he liked to smoke. Grushko watched the 
incriminating smoke curl around Kornilov's fingertips. Not wood, he thought, 
but smoked fish. Kornilov was kippering his own fingers. He wondered what the 
man's lungs looked like. For that matter, what did his own lungs look like?  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 Good question.

 In the news: What do Ollie North, Dan Rostenkowski and Marion Barry have in 
common? Comedy writer Bob Mills says all three are saving a bundle by using 
police mug shots in their campaign brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert W. Morgan (KRTH 101.1 FM), on cocaine being found in the blood of the 
pilot who crashed the plane at the White House: "This proves that he was not in 
Washington to harm President Clinton. He was there to vote for Marion Barry." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Leno, on Clinton staying at Blair House during the crash: "This is the 
first time that sleeping in the wrong bed has actually gotten him out of 
trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Comic Argus Hamilton says Republican leaders have forgotten why their party 
was founded: "They don't want U.S. soldiers to die capturing an old slave 
colony like Haiti. In 1861, Bob Dole would have told Abe Lincoln to just go 
with the flow." 
</P>
<P>
 David Letterman, on the U.S.-Cuba agreement: "The U.S. will now accept 20,000 
Cuban refugees every year -- provided they can play baseball and don't care 
about a salary cap." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Also in the news: Comedy writer Alan Ray, on Ted Kennedy's son, Patrick, 
running for Congress in Rhode Island: "He has rejected his dad's traditional

 Comedy writer Mark Miller, on the Buffalo State College honor-roll student 
sentenced to 90 days in jail for financing her education as a $150-an-hour call 
girl: "Or, for $75, she would undress while contrasting the novels of Hemingway 
and Fitzgerald." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds comedy writer Tony Peyser: "At these prices, she'll soon be able to 
afford an Ivy League school." 
</P>
<P>
 Peyser, on the Kansas City trial of the mayor and an aide, charged with 
conspiracy involving a reported $4,000 bribe from a strip club owner: 
"Apparently the payment had some G-strings attached." 
</P>
<P>

 Reader file: Dean and Janis Moody of Alhambra wonder about the merger of Alpha 
Beta and Ralph's: "We're not entirely sure if we would be comfortable walking 
into any place with the name RalphaBeta." 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Brooks of Bellflower thinks some may be too quick to dismiss O.J.'s 
claim about the fake mustache and beard: "After all, it could have been a 
Disney Passport in the Bronco, and $10,000 is about right for drinks, snacks 
and souvenirs for three." 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Kaplan of Garden Grove says his daughter describes her new boyfriend as 
"very shallow: He doesn't get into the swim of things, he just wades."

RUNWAY TO REALITY: BY DESIGN; THE WELL-HEELED LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA DENDEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Look: Sheer legs and towering high heels. Here are three of the hottest 
and highest versions. 
</P>
<P>
 How to Do It Big, I: The shoe for fall is nothing new -- the simple, 
stiletto-heeled pumps with extra pointy toes scream sex appeal.But this season, 
designers have decreed that they should be worn with fall's ubiquitous little 
suit -- even to the office. London shoe designer Manolo Blahnik's version, from 
Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills, is real patent leather.  
</P>
<P>
 Total: $395. 
</P>
<P>
 How to Do It Budget, I: Frederick's of Hollywood is the source for bargain 
stilettos. These super four-inch spikes come in black, red, white and bone 
leather or black patent leather.  
</P>
<P>
 Total: $29. 
</P>
<P>
 How to Do It Big, II: Direct from Paris, the clear vinyl, high-heel boot by 
Karl Lagerfeld has appeared in every fashion magazine this month. But just try 
to find them in the stores. Neiman Marcus in Beverly Hills still has some left. 
The boot has side zippers, padded soles and tiny air holes at the instep. 
</P>
<P>
 Total: $395.  
</P>
<P>
 How to Do It Budget, II: The see-through, vinyl boot from Frederick's of 
Hollywood comes with shiny white, yellow or black tips. Unlike the French 
version, it lacks ventilation.  
</P>
<P>
 Total: $89. 
</P>
<P>
 How to Do It Big, III: The hot high heel from Chanel. "We can't keep them in 
stock," says Victoria Kaye of I. Magnin, Beverly Hills. This four-inch-high 
pump with patent leather tips comes in black or white with black tips.  
</P>
<P>
 Total: $425. 
</P>
<P>
 How to Do It Budget, III: New York shoe designer Kenneth Cole's ankle-strap 
pump is a lot clunkier than Chanel's, but more practical for the average 
suit-wearing gal.  
</P>
<P>
 Total: $125.

RSVP / INTO THE NIGHT: STILL NOT PAST THE FRESHNESS DATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Scene: Tuesday's party at the House of Blues celebrating the 100th episode 
of NBC's "The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air." There was much reason to celebrate. The 
show now goes into syndication which translates into a waterfall of cash for 
everyone involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Who Was There: The show's star, Will Smith; co-stars Daphne Maxwell Reid, 
James Avery, Alfonso Ribeiro, Karyn Parsons, Tatyana M. Ali and Ross Bagley; 
executive producer Quincy Jones; plus 450 guests including Branford Marsalis, 
Evander Holyfield, Kool Moe Dee, Sherman Hemsley, Jasmine Guy, Nastassja Kinski 
and NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield, who said, "This show has 
given us five years of breathing room on Monday night. It turns on the lights 
in one of TV's most important time periods." 
</P>
<P>
 What Syndication Means: "Syndication means your ex-wife knows the check will 
be coming regularly," said co-star Joseph Marcell. "It means you can be dead, 
buried and forgotten and the checks keep on coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Dress Mode: A fashion spectrum the width of Nevada. Everything from TV execs 
in sincere suits to teen-agers who might have spent the day skateboarding in 
Venice. As for Smith, he came in a white turtleneck with a tweed coat. One 
guest described the look as "rapper dressed for the hunt." 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "What I learned from doing this show is everyone possesses the ability 
to do what they want," said Smith. "A lot of times things seem out of reach, 
that other people have some magical gift that makes them what they are -- that 
you don't have -- so you can't be that. That gift does not exist. All you need 
is to work hard. Anything you can work hard at you can do." 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood Education: In the four months his successful club has been open, 
what has the exotically titled House of Blues Director of Public Awareness 
Nigel Shanley learned? "To deal with wonderfully fragile egos." 
</P>
<P>
 When It's Time to Leave the Party: One male guest discussing drinking: "I 
don't like the kind of hangover where you get into the car, you don't know how 
to shift and everything looks like the surface of the moon." 
</P>
<P>
 High Point: For at least one woman, the evening peaked when Smith got up on 
stage and rapped. Asked what the sitcom star said, she replied, "It doesn't 
matter. He rapped."

FASHION / SCREEN STYLE: THE YOUNG AND THE SUITLESS

 The Series: "Extra -- The Entertainment Magazine" (NBC, Monday through Friday, 
7 p.m.). 
</P>
<P>
 The Setup: Hosts Arthel Neville and Dave Nemeth (pictured) introduce segments 
on late-breaking celebrity, movie, television and music news. 
</P>
<P>
 The Look: Neville and Nemeth are in no way living on the same planet as their 
"Entertainment Tonight" rivals, Mary Hart -- in her trademark clothes that 
sparkle -- and John Tesh, in jacket and tie. And yet while always put together, 
Neville and Nemeth don't always come across like they exist in the land of 
reality. Neville, the more polished of the two, fares better than Nemeth, who 
strains to look Hollywood. There's no denying that everything they wear is the 
newest and the latest, but it's not always divine. 
</P>
<P>
 We Could Live Without: Yes, we all know that men wearing shirts buttoned to 
the top and without a tie can be very cool, but certainly not night after 
night. More to the point -- and this may seem horribly old-fashioned -- on a 
slick show such as this, a tie would prove more commanding. Yes, Nemeth's 
unmatching vests and blazers and trousers all worn together can be very 
sophisticated. Seen on television, however, it just looks like he's a man in 
need of a suit. 
</P>
<P>
 On the very night Hart wore one of her metallic-edged suits and camisoles 
(don't forget the rhinestone earrings), Neville -- who strictly wears trousers 
-- donned comparatively subdued gray slacks, satiny patchwork vest and satin 
blouse, which one couldn't help but notice was buttoned to the top exactly like 
that of her co-host. She looks best on nights when she's not working to be In 
Fashion with those novelty shirts, "Extra"-wide trousers and "Extra"-long 
jacket. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoted: "I don't even know where Mary (Hart) gets those kinds of clothes 
anymore, but Arthel wouldn't be caught dead in any of those things. She's just 
a natural woman. The other thing is, Arthel and Dave are about 15 years younger 
than Mary and John," says Cynthia Riley, consulting executive producer, 
explaining why Neville and Nemeth should look different from "Entertainment 
Tonight's" hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 Good Hair Day: The powers-that-be were right in persuading Neville to chop off 
her medium-length hair in favor of a jaunty, short do. How much persuading did 
it take? Riley says Neville was given four hair stylists to interview and short 
wigs to sample. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss: Compared to the polished-looking hosts, the correspondents are a scruffy 
bunch, with Ethan Hawke wanna-be John Norris reporting one day in backward 
baseball cap and sunglasses. 
</P>

GET YOUR KICKS ON ROUTE 66 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Why do people get such a kick out of Route 66 -- that stretch of road that 
brought many a dreamer West? Tom Snyder, author of "The Route 66 Traveler's 
Guide and Roadside Companion," has a theory: "A lot hasn't changed in the last 
30 to 50 years. People who travel the route get a feeling of what this country 
was -- and still is.It's easy to forget that now with our frequent flier 
programs." 
</P>
<P>
 You may capture the real or imagined spirit of Route 66 at the "Route 66 
Rendezvous" this weekend. Beginning today in San Bernardino, on and around a 
portion of the famous route that Snyder says once marked "the transition from 
the mountains to the orange groves," the biggest attraction is expected to be 
the classic car cruise. Dan Stark of the San Bernardino visitor's bureau says 
about 1,400 vehicles will make the drive over four days on streets closed off 
around City Hall. Other events include a street fair, food court, motor sport 
expo, automobile art exhibit featuring Big Daddy Ed Roth (the Rat Fink artist). 
</P>
<P>
 These events are free, but there are also related happenings at the National 
Orange Show grounds: the Spectrum Classic Car Auction ($10), the AutoSound 
Challenge, Mobile Electronics Expo and, Saturday only at 8 p.m., the Legends of 
Route 66 concert ($12; children under 12, free). And at the airport -- formerly 
Norton Air Force Base -- Stoplight Drags (Saturday only, $5) and a Soap Box 
Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're the owner of an American sports car, a pre-1972 American-made car or 
a '66 or older European classic, you can still take part in the cruise (no 
low-riders or mini-trucks).

 IF THERE'S SMOKE: Booster clubs in Cypress are preparing to move their 
fund-raising bingo games from a public school there. Reason: There's a new 
federal law taking effect in December that will ban all smoking at public 
schools. And when you're waiting for the G-31 you might need to bingo, there is 
a lot of smoking. . . . "About 85% of our bingo players smoke," said Dave 
Kinney, president of the Cypress Band and Pageantry Boosters. "If we didn't 
allow smoking, we wouldn't have any attendance." 
</P>
<P>
 DON'T DRIVE IN: In the movie business, it's often the drive-ins that have a 
hard time drawing a crowd. Pacific Theaters tried to keep its Twin Drive-In in 
Orange, just off the Santa Ana Freeway, in operation by providing Spanish 
subtitles -- like last week for the double bill of "True Lies" and "Natural 
Born Killers." But this week, it announced the theater is closing, apparently 
for good. . . . But you can still hit the swap meet there on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 GOOD DIVORCE: Since financial planner Violet Woodhouse of Anaheim Hills is 
also an attorney, it was only natural for her to combine her two interests by 
specializing in family law. . . . "They go together," she says. "In a divorce, 
the main question often is, 'Do I give up the house or the pension plan?' " 
Woodhouse this month has been chosen by Worth magazine as one of the 60 top 
financial advisers in the country. Says the lawyer: "Too many people get ripped 
off in divorce because they know too few details about their financial status." 
</P>
<P>
 NEWPORT SLUMMING: It's spicy enough to have a Newport Beach mailing address, 
but the prestige piles on if you can say you live on "the Peninsula." Not 
everybody on the Peninsula, however, is happy these days. . . . Some of its 
residents complained to the City Council this week about its dirty sidewalks, 
dilapidated buildings and youth-oriented businesses. But one resident incensed 
at these criticisms countered: "I wasn't aware I was living in a slum."

NEWS ANALYSIS; CLINTON'S CHALLENGE: INVASION PERSUASION; LEADERSHIP: AMERICANS 
NEED TO FEEL HAITI IS IMPORTANT TO THE U.S. SO FAR THE WHITE HOUSE HAS HARDLY 
MADE THAT CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. BRODER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton will address the nation tonight to explain why a U.S. 
invasion of Haiti, which appears imminent, is necessary and just. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a lot of explaining to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans seem to have no clear idea why the United States is about to embark 
on a sizable foreign military adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear there's turmoil down there, political differences, I guess. Aristide, 
isn't he a dictator?" asked 21-year-old Amy Inskip of Gettysburg, Pa., 
referring to democratically elected Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, 
who was ousted by a military coup three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Inskip said that the United States should stay out of Haiti because "it'll be 
another Vietnam. We'll be stuck there for years. I don't think the White House 
has done a good job of selling anybody on anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Becky Curtwright of Seattle also acknowledged knowing little about the 
situation in Haiti, but she expressed fear that the United States might get 
sucked into another quagmire like Vietnam or Somalia. 
</P>
<P>
 If the United States does invade, Curtwright said, "It should not be us by 
ourselves. . . . I don't think the U.S. always should be responsible for 
carrying the world's problems." 
</P>
<P>
 The public anxiety and confusion are not surprising. Opposition is growing in 
Congress; on Wednesday the Senate opened a debate on the issue of an invasion. 
And only in recent days have Clinton's aides started a public sales pitch. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton himself has had virtually nothing to say on Haiti for weeks, passing 
up several opportunities -- including a major address Friday in New Orleans 
before a large, friendly audience. In that speech, at a Baptist convention, 
Clinton spoke for 45 minutes about the decline in American values, never 
mentioning Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 For a variety of reasons, the Administration has done less groundwork than 
usual to prepare the American people for the idea that their troops are going 
to be sent into battle overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had hoped that public threats would persuade Haiti's junta leaders 
to step down. And Clinton has been distracted by a bitter fight over his crime 
bill, the death of his dream of passing a comprehensive health care reform 
proposal this year and a two-week vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 The President has devoted no time in recent weeks to public education about 
the American stake in Haiti and the case for U.S. military action there. 
</P>
<P>
 It shows. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls portray a public remarkably ignorant and confused about the situation in 
Haiti and about why the United States appears to be on the verge of sending 
troops into the impoverished Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 An ABC poll released this week found that only 28% of Americans believe that 
the United States has a vital interest in Haiti, while 62% said there is none. 
</P>
<P>
 And only 37% said they believe that the United States and its allies should 
use military power to restore democracy in Haiti. Support for intervention 
actually has fallen through the summer -- from 45% in favor of an invasion in 
June. Opposition to military action in Haiti has been steadily rising, from 50% 
in June to 54% in July to 56% this week. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that the more Americans learn about Haiti, the less inclined they are 
to see American blood shed there. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want them to go in. I'm against it," said Tom Barrows, who owns an 
Atlanta office supply store. "Getting into Haiti will be easy. The trick will 
be getting out. This is not Grenada." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, popular uncertainty and skepticism about sending combat troops 
overseas are not unusual in American history. 
</P>
<P>
 Public support for the Korean War was never strong, and Franklin D. Roosevelt 
was far ahead of public opinion when he began helping the British during the 
early months of World War II. Vietnam tore the country apart. 
</P>
<P>
 When troops are actually committed to combat, public opinion almost always 
rallies around the flag -- at least for a time. Clinton is counting on it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that the American people have a great tradition of rallying around 
their President (when) U.S. troops are involved, and there's, I think, a long 
precedent of that," said White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet failure to build a solid public foundation under military intervention 
when the national interest is not dramatically threatened has cost Presidents 
dearly in the past. Korea and Vietnam played a role in the decisions of Harry 
S. Truman and Lyndon B. Johnson not to seek reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton's current political weakness, combined with the underlying 
difficulties of the situation in Haiti, makes the danger of a public backlash 
especially great this time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's successful and casualties are extremely low, you'll find general 
support for it," said John Mueller, a political scientist at the University of 
Rochester in New York and author of "War, Presidents and Public Opinion." 
</P>
<P>
 "But there isn't much of a big bounce in these things. Everyone agrees that 
Haiti is a small problem. If he solves it, he gets minimal credit, because it's 
so small. But if things go bad, it's a total disaster." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's failure to lay the groundwork for involvement in Haiti stands in 
striking contrast to the tactics of his immediate predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 For months before the December, 1989, invasion of Panama, the George Bush 
Administration filled the airwaves with threats, warnings and explanations of 
the crimes of dictator Manuel A. Noriega and the American interest in deposing 
him. Pentagon and State Department officials let few days pass without 
recounting another Panamanian atrocity or threat against American military and 
civilian personnel there. 
</P>
<P>
 The drumbeat resulted in dramatically rising public support for action against 
Noriega. In October, 1989, a Gallup Poll found that only 26% favored using U.S. 
forces to invade Panama. But on Dec. 20, 1989, the eve of the Panama invasion, 
58% of those polled by ABC News favored the U.S. overthrow of Noriega. 
</P>
<P>
 Following Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, 1990, the fall and winter 
brought an almost daily public countdown on the potential approach of a Persian 
Gulf War, leading up to a widely publicized and highly informative 
congressional debate that galvanized opinion on the impending action. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the falling support for an invasion of Haiti, public sentiment 
in favor of attacking Iraq grew dramatically in the weeks preceding the Gulf 
War. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the result, at least in part, of a concerted effort by the Bush 
Administration to convince the American people of the necessity of military 
action against Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlin Fitzwater, communications director in the Bush White House, said that 
Bush and other senior officials identified three or four easily understood 
reasons for going to war against Hussein and repeated them endlessly. Clinton 
has yet to do anything comparable with regard to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "What won't work is trying to do it in one shot," Fitzwater said, referring to 
Clinton's expected attempt tonight to justify the use of force in Haiti. "You 
can't give one speech to the American people and forget it. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are on the verge of an invasion, and nobody knows why," Fitzwater 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence of this can be found on street corners and in shopping malls. 
</P>
<P>
 Sue Scott, 48, of Jacksonville, Fla., sitting on a bench outside an ice-cream 
parlor in Gettysburg, Pa., was asked what she thought about the prospect of an 
American-led war in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any opinion. I haven't heard much about it," Scott said. "Isn't 
it that we want somebody back in -- or was that another country?" 
</P>

WHITE MALES MAY INCREASE AT WHITE HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta approaches his final 
recommendations on a long-delayed staff reorganization, aides have begun to 
recognize a potentially serious political problem -- too many white guys. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta has been working for nearly three months on plans to revamp President 
Clinton's sometimes chaotic staff -- a period far longer than most White House 
aides had expected. The length of the process already has hurt morale on the 
staff noticeably and led to considerable bitterness on the part of those whose 
jobs have been left twisting in the winds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just unfair to people," said one White House aide. "It looks bad for 
Leon and for the President." 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta has made some changes already, placing three longtime aides, including 
one woman, in mid-level White House posts, for example. Officials said that 
broader announcements of at least some of the changes could come any day, 
although they have been saying that for more than a week. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, however, some White House officials have begun making plans 
of their own, expanding the usual midterm exodus. "Everyone's worn out," said 
one official. "The whole thing is admitting it and convincing your ego to let 
you leave here." 
</P>
<P>
 Those expected to leave include a majority of the top-ranking women on 
Clinton's immediate staff -- people largely unknown to the general public 
except as anonymous "senior White House officials" but who hold posts key to 
the internal workings of the White House. Although the expected departures will 
play out over several months and are not likely to end until early next year, 
they amount to a slow-motion shake-up of the original Clinton staff. 
</P>
<P>
 And increasingly, White House officials are concerned that those departures 
could undermine Clinton's claim of having an Administration that "looks like 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't really say there's a problem until you know the other half -- who's 
going to replace all these folks," cautioned one senior Clinton aide. "But it 
is fair to say there's a concern." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the details of Panetta's reorganization plan have been kept a tight 
secret, he is widely expected to announce a new structure that provides for a 
more central, hierarchical system designed to increase accountability and end 
the practice of having several senior aides who can freely float from issue to 
issue. Senior adviser George Stephanopoulos, for example, is likely to become a 
deputy chief of staff. Bruce Lindsey, Clinton's longtime friend and White House 
counselor, is likely to become a deputy to Abner J. Mikva, the new White House 
counsel who begins his duties in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that new structure, several existing jobs likely will be 
downgraded, which is one of the factors that has led several high-ranking women 
at the White House to make plans to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those expected to depart are Ricki Seidman, head of the scheduling 
office, who plans to move to Los Angeles and become executive director of Rock 
the Vote, the nonpartisan group that aims to increase political participation 
by young people; Christine Varney, director of Cabinet affairs, who is expected 
to become a member of the Federal Trade Commission; and Joan Baggett, head of 
the political office. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some sources said that Alexis Herman, director of public liaison, 
probably will return to her private consulting business sometime early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Another highly visible woman whose fate remains uncertain is Press Secretary 
Dee Dee Myers. The highly public speculation about Myers' being replaced has 
angered many of her friends in the White House, who have said that she is being 
made a scapegoat for problems that top officials would like to blame on 
"communications." These officials said that Panetta unfairly has allowed Myers' 
job to dangle without resolving the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dee Dee's been through hell for Clinton on everything -- from the worst days 
of the campaign up through the last few months. She deserves to be treated 
better," said one official who served with Myers in the campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence does not suggest any conscious effort to squeeze out high-ranking 
women on the staff. Indeed, Panetta and Clinton made serious efforts to keep 
Seidman on board, offering her another high-level post in place of her current 
one. Panetta has also consulted Herman more consistently on policy decisions, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some high-ranking men are likely to be leaving as well. Staff secretary John 
Podesta, for example, has long planned to leave at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, women on Clinton's staff have long complained about what one 
high-ranking female aide called an "inclusion problem" -- a sense that while 
women hold many posts, the key players at the White House are all men except 
for First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her chief of staff, Margaret A. 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta's attempts to streamline the system by cutting the number of people 
present at meetings has had the side effect of increasing that problem by more 
noticeably concentrating authority in a small number of white, male hands. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Panetta reportedly has been making efforts to recruit women to 
replace some of those leaving, he has run into two problems. First, the new 
chief of staff has also been trying to increase the number of aides with 
Washington Establishment credentials -- an effort that almost inevitably leads 
to a staff that is older, whiter and more male. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, after 19 months of watching the White House deal with crisis 
after crisis while presidential aides have worked 14-hour days, many in 
Washington have been politely listening to Panetta's pitches and saying "no 
thanks." 
</P>
<P>
 "People want to have a life," said one official. "A lot of people just don't 
want to come work here."

U.S. SWEETENS DEAL TO GET HAITI LEADERS TO LEAVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<P>
 President Clinton, warning Haiti's military rulers that a U.S. invasion could 
come any day, has made a last-minute offer to spirit them out of the country 
into comfortable retirement abroad if they agree to step down, officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. offer to Haiti's three top leaders includes promises of safe 
transportation off the island, including protection by U.S. military units, if 
needed, and a haven in one of several countries in South America or Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The time is at hand, and they need to leave," Clinton told reporters in the 
Oval Office. "And they're going to leave one way or another." How they leave, 
he added, "is up to them." 
</P>
<P>
 "If they decide to leave, we'll help them with the arrangements," Secretary of 
State Warren Christopher said on PBS television, adding that the Administration 
is "taking special steps" to make sure that the Haitian leaders could negotiate 
a deal if they choose. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Wednesday, Haiti's army-installed president vowed that the regime will 
not back down in the face of increasing U.S. pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will maintain the chosen direction. . . ," Emile Jonassaint said in a news 
conference at the national palace in Port-au-Prince, the capital. "We have 
harmed no one, threatened neither the peace of America or of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official said that secret emissaries have been sent to each of the 
three top officers in Haiti's regime -- Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras, Brig. Gen. 
Philippe Biamby and Lt. Col. Michel-Joseph Francois -- to seek negotiations on 
the terms of their departure. But other officials refused to confirm that. 
</P>
<P>
 The aim of the offer is to entice one or more of the officers to leave the 
country voluntarily -- an event that U.S. officials believe would lead to the 
collapse of the Haitian army and make it unnecessary for the United States to 
invade to accomplish its goal of reinstalling exiled President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has long said that it is willing to help the leaders step 
down, but in recent weeks U.S. officials have been working on ways to make the 
offer more attractive -- to "sweeten the pot," one aide said. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. diplomats have sought offers of havens in several South American 
countries as well as France and Spain, where Cedras reportedly owns a vacation 
home. At least one South American country is said to have responded positively. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior officials turned down the idea of sending the officers to the 
neighboring Dominican Republic. "We didn't want them that close to Haiti," said 
one. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice Department lawyers have researched ways that the Haitian officers can 
be moved without subjecting them to arrest or exposing them to extradition by 
the Aristide government, one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said that the United States does not plan to pay the Haitians to 
leave and added that bribery should not be necessary. "They've already got 
their money hidden away" in other countries, said one official involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Merely getting the officers and their families safely out of Haiti could pose 
problems. Lower-ranking officers in the army have reportedly threatened to kill 
the commanders if they try to leave, so U.S. officials have had to consider 
"extracting" them in a rescue mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Several senior officials said that they do not expect that kind of action to 
be necessary. Nevertheless, in case some kind of covert operation is needed, 
Clinton recently sent Congress a secret intelligence "finding" notifying them 
of the possibility, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A key part of the plan, one aide said, is that the United States is offering 
each of the three top officers a separate deal -- in the hope that at least one 
will accept. 
</P>
<P>
 The result would be a split in the regime's leadership that officials hope 
could lead to the army's collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to leave no stone unturned to give (Cedras) an opportunity to 
make that decision, which is the right decision," Christopher said on PBS. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged that there has been no clear indication yet that Cedras, 
Biamby or Francois might leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in an interview with four news agency reporters, sought to press the 
message that his patience has run out after three years of diplomatic attempts 
to restore Aristide, who was elected in 1990 and ousted by the army in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have literally exhausted every available alternative, and the time has 
come for those people to get out," Clinton said. "They can still leave. They do 
not have to push this to a confrontation." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton will address the nation on the issue at 6 p.m. PDT today, and aides 
said that the televised speech will be an ultimatum to the Haitian leaders to 
step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has not decided whether to give them a specific deadline for leaving, 
they said. Administration officials have been debating whether such a public 
deadline will help push the Haitians out or, conversely, stiffen their resolve 
to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 During the interview, Clinton held up grisly photographs of the corpses of 
murdered Haitian dissidents and said he is "very angry" at the military 
regime's conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that, when the American people know the facts of this, they will be 
supportive," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 ". . . I know the timing is unpopular. I know the whole thing is unpopular. 
But I believe it is the right thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a preview of his television speech, Clinton spelled out four reasons why 
the United States should intervene in Haiti: to stop human rights abuses, to 
prevent another exodus of Haitian refugees, to help democracy take root 
throughout the Western Hemisphere and to show that the United States will keep 
its promises. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton refused to say when an invasion might come. But the White House 
announced that he will cut short a planned visit to Los Angeles this weekend, a 
switch that increased speculation that military action is near. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton plans to attend a Democratic Party fund-raising event in Los Angeles 
on Sunday. He was originally scheduled to remain until Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 As the President spoke, U.S. Navy ships loaded with Army soldiers and Marines 
continued toward Haiti, and Air Force planes assembled at bases in Puerto Rico 
and Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 As tensions increased Wednesday over the crisis, the Dwight D. Eisenhower, an 
aircraft carrier with the Army's 10th Mountain Light Infantry Division troops 
aboard, left Norfolk, Va., headed for Haitian waters. 
</P>
<P>
 The America, another aircraft carrier capable of carrying up to 2,000 Special 
Forces troops, was off the north Florida coast on its way to the region. 
</P>
<P>
 A third vessel, the amphibious command ship Mount Whitney, is to leave today. 
It will serve as the command and control center for any military operation and 
will be headquarters for Army Lt. Gen. Henry Hugh Shelton. As commander of the 
18th Airborne Corps at Ft. Bragg, N.C., Shelton would be the top U.S. military 
leader directing U.S. forces in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense Secretary William J. Perry, asked at the Pentagon on Wednesday morning 
about more troop movements, indicated that U.S. invasion troops will be ready 
"very soon" if the military dictatorship in Port-au-Prince does not acquiesce 
and step down. 
</P>
<P>
 In Haiti, two U.S. Army Blackhawk helicopters flew over Port-au-Prince, and 
low-flying U.S. airplanes dropped thousands of leaflets bearing Aristide's 
photograph and a promise of his return. 
</P>
<P>
 The military government's Ministry of the Interior and Defense declared a 
partial curfew from 7 p.m. until 7 a.m., banning driving on main roads as well 
as departures of boats and planes.

U.S. STUDY FUELS DEBATE ON ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS' IMPACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BORNEMEIER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adding new fuel to the debate over the impact of illegal immigration, a study 
released by the Clinton Administration on Wednesday finds that it costs 
California $1.28 billion annually to pay for the education of illegal immigrant 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also estimates that the state pays $368 million to incarcerate 
illegal immigrants and between $113 million and $166 million for emergency 
Medicaid services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, commissioned by the White House as a source of objective data in a 
dispute with seven states that contend they are burdened by illegal 
immigration, confirms that California has the largest population of illegal 
immigrants and the greatest costs, including a disproportionate number of 
imprisoned illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers arrived at in the study, while large, were substantially smaller 
than those claimed by California Gov. Pete Wilson in a series of high-profile 
challenges to the Clinton Administration's handling of immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Conducted by the Urban Institute, a Washington think tank with recognized 
immigration expertise, the study is expected to be injected into California's 
debate over Proposition 187, the November ballot measure that would deny most 
government services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 It also may put more pressure on the federal government to aid the seven 
affected states. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the White House and the Urban Institute emphasized that the study was 
limited in its scope and offered no specific recommendations. It studied only 
the seven states most heavily affected by illegal immigration: California, 
Florida, Texas, New York, Illinois, Arizona and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who has seized the illegal immigration issue as a key part of his 
reelection campaign, said the report "validates my key point -- the federal 
failure to control the border is creating a multibillion-dollar problem for 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Urban Institute study reached no comprehensive conclusion on the 
question, statistics strongly suggest that California and the other six states 
studied spend more dollars on federally mandated programs than they collect in 
taxes from the overwhelmingly young and poor population of illegal immigrants, 
estimated by the study to number 3.4 million nationwide as of October, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "The share of tax revenues paid by undocumented aliens is far less than their 
share of the population in each state, largely because of the 
lower-than-average incomes of undocumented aliens," a report summary said. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, illegal immigrants paid an estimated $732 million in taxes -- 
about 1.7% of all taxes collected. But they represent 4.6% of the state's 
population, the Urban Institute said. 
</P>
<P>
 In other findings, the report: 
</P>
<P>
 * Estimated California's illegal immigration population at 1.4 million as of 
October, 1992, and said it has risen to 1.7 million this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Found that California has a disproportionate share of the incarcerated 
illegal immigrants in the seven states studied -- 71% -- while having only 43% 
of the illegal immigrant population nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 * Found that California's annual incarceration costs of $368 million dwarf 
those of the next-highest state -- New York, with $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
 At a briefing, White House officials criticized Wilson's handling of the 
state's immigration data. 
</P>
<P>
 "California has substantially exaggerated its costs," said Christopher Edley 
Jr., associate director of the Office of Management and Budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The study found that California estimates for education and Medicaid costs 
were much larger than the Urban Institute's calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 The state estimate for schooling illegal immigrant children is $2.15 billion; 
the Urban Institute arrived at a figure of $1.28 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, state emergency Medicaid costs for illegal immigrants were estimated 
at $350 million; the White House study offered two Medicaid "benchmarks," 
ranging from $113 million to $165 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Philip Romero, chief economist in the governor's Office of Planning and 
Research, said the discrepancies were caused by differing methodologies. He 
said the Urban Institute used older data in some instances and had to use only 
national data in order to achieve consistency among the seven states studied. 
He contended that the White House study omitted some cost categories that are 
unique to California. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was commissioned in January after Wilson and other governors beset 
by immigration problems met with then-Budget Director Leon Panetta to plead for 
more federal money. 
</P>
<P>
 Panetta, doubtful of some of the states' cost estimates, commissioned the 
Urban Institute to provide credible statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The study cost $76,000 and was paid for by a grant from the Justice 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House made clear that, while the study pointed out serious problems, 
no shower of federal assistance was likely. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magnitude (of the problem) is large and serious," Edley said. "But we do 
not have a stack of blank checks in Washington to mail to governors for 
purposes of fiscal relief." 
</P>
<P>
 Edley said the Administration's highest priority is improved border security 
and a new federal program to reimburse states for a portion of their costs for 
jailing illegal immigrant criminals. "There are no policy recommendations (in 
the report)," Edley said. "This is grist for the policy debate." 
</P>
<P>
 Also Wednesday, the Wilson Administration put out its own updated report on 
the cost of illegal immigrants. It takes a decidedly sterner stance than the 
Urban Institute, saying that illegal immigrants cost the state $3.4 billion 
annually but pay only $739 million in taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson study concluded that the average illegal immigrant household 
receives $7,760 in government services each year. "To cover the cost of 
services they receive in California, the average illegal immigrant household 
would have to earn $100,000 a year," Romero said. 
</P>
<P>
 State Treasurer Kathleen Brown, Wilson's Democratic challenger for the 
governorship, paid little attention to the numbers imbroglio and instead 
criticized Wilson for his support -- while in the U.S. Senate -- of an 
agriculture program that allowed 1 million illegal immigrant workers to enter 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wilson's political hypocrisy has cost taxpayers billions of dollars, and 
voters can see through his election-year finger-pointing," said Steven Glazer, 
a Brown spokesman.

FINAL DNA TESTS POINT TO SIMPSON, SOURCES SAY; COURTS: AT LEAST TWO DROPS FOUND 
AT CRIME SCENE ARE SAID TO MATCH HIS BLOOD. SOME RESULTS ARE INCONCLUSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH FRAMMOLINO and JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Final DNA tests in the O.J. Simpson murder case point to Simpson as the source 
of at least some of the blood drops found near the bodies of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman, sources close to the case said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests still are being conducted by two laboratories, and some of the results 
so far are inconclusive. But a batch of final results forwarded to defense 
lawyers and prosecutors this week point to a "match" between Simpson's blood 
and that of at least two of the drops found in a line leading away from the 
bodies, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tests for the so-called "genetic fingerprint" could be the most damaging 
physical evidence to date against the former football great, who has pleaded 
not guilty to the double murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources also disclosed Wednesday that a hair found on Goldman is being 
analyzed to determine whether it matches Simpson's hair. A match there could 
for the first time link Simpson to Goldman at the crime scene, a potentially 
damaging revelation that defense experts might challenge by questioning how 
only a single hair could end up on Goldman given the furious struggle that 
authorities believe took place between the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's lawyers declined to comment. "The judge has directed us not to 
discuss the scientific evidence, and I'm going to honor that," said Robert L. 
Shapiro, one of Simpson's lead attorneys. Simpson's lawyers have indicated that 
they intend to mount an aggressive campaign to discredit the scientific tests, 
which they say have been marred by sloppy police and scientific work. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest disclosures come in the wake of efforts by Los Angeles County Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti to shore up a potential trouble spot in the prosecution 
case. Garcetti has called San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan and another top 
county official to ask that their medical examiner be allowed to testify as an 
expert for the prosecution in the upcoming trial. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, however, San Francisco officials have refused to release Medical 
Examiner Boyd Stephens, saying they simply cannot spare him because of budget 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti approached the San Francisco officials after the Los Angeles County 
deputy medical examiner who performed the autopsies on Nicole Simpson and 
Goldman came under furious attack by the former football great's defense 
attorneys during a preliminary hearing in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Forensic experts say the medical examiner, Irwin L. Golden, at times looked 
tentative or confused during questioning by Shapiro, who belittled Golden's 
credentials. Golden admitted throwing away Nicole Simpson's stomach contents 
and failing to closely examine a knife detectives believed was similar to the 
weapon used in the June 12 murders -- lapses that some predict may hurt the 
prosecution's case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Golden may be a very nice person, a very amicable person, but he did not 
on the stand give a feeling of confidence in what he was saying," said Werner 
U. Spitz, former Wayne County, Mich., medical examiner and author of a widely 
used textbook for forensic pathologists. "He did not portray an individual who 
reasons scientifically and who gives the feeling to a jury . . . that he really 
knows what he's talking about." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Golden's personal judgment has come under scrutiny as 
well. A few weeks after his July 8 testimony, police investigated him for 
allegedly brandishing a gun-like object in the common area of the coroner's 
office and shouting threats to lawyers. Police said Golden, who has declined 
comment, appeared to be joking. He was not charged. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Garcetti's office has mounted a concerted campaign to backstop 
their case by recruiting Stephens as an expert witness. San Francisco's medical 
examiner for 23 years, Stephens has testified for the Los Angeles County 
district attorney's office before, is a nationally respected forensic 
pathologist and is the president-elect of the National Assn. of Medical 
Examiners. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens confirmed that he has been contacted repeatedly by an "intermediary" 
about the case. Although no specifics were discussed, Stephens said he assumed 
he would be reviewing the autopsy records and testifying about what forensic 
evidence says about time of death -- a crucial element since Simpson's lawyers 
say he was home when the murders took place, preparing for a trip to Chicago 
that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens said he declined the offer because his office has sustained 25% 
budget cuts over the last few years, depriving his staff of five positions and 
forcing him to perform autopsies as well as maintain administrative duties. 
"I'm not looking for outside work," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A source familiar with the discussion said that part of the problem is that 
Stephens believes it would take two months to adequately review the documents 
for the Los Angeles trial while at the same time running his own office. "They 
thought he could review the records in one day, prepare another and testify on 
the third," the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephens' boss, Chief Administrative Officer Rudy Nothenberg, said earlier 
this week that Garcetti called him to lobby for the medical examiner's 
services, arguing that he needed to bolster the prosecution with an expert 
witness. But Nothenberg said he had to turn Garcetti down because he was afraid 
Stephens would become ensnared in the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your district attorney suggested it would not be long but I'm afraid it would 
be an extensive commitment," said Nothenberg. "While I'm sure Mr. Garcetti is a 
man of his word, there's no telling how long the defense would keep him 
(Stephens) on the stand." 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Jordan spokesman Noah Griffin also confirmed that Garcetti 
called the mayor last week about springing Stephens. 
</P>
<P>
 "The presumption was that the result of the coroner's work down there wasn't 
satisfactory and they wanted someone with (Stephens') experience to freshly 
review what was done," said Griffin. "But at this point, we're just unable to 
spare him. We face $600-million worth of projected budget deficits in the 
Jordan Administration. . . . He's overworked and understaffed." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Garcetti said Wednesday it is not unusual for the office to 
use expert witnesses, but declined to comment on his phone calls or outline the 
normal procedure for requesting help from other jurisdictions. A coroner's 
spokesman also declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 It was unclear whether Stephens would be a substitute prosecution witness for 
Golden or be called as an expert to bolster the coroner's testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection in the case is scheduled to begin Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development Wednesday, Simpson's lawyers filed papers opposing a 
prosecution request to have jurors in the case fully sequestered from the time 
the trial starts until it ends to shield them from what is expected to be one 
of the most publicized criminal trials in recent history. 
</P>
<P>
 The reasons for the defense opposition to the sequestration were not known 
because the papers were filed under seal. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the sequestration order sought by the prosecution, the jurors would be 
put up in hotels at night and not allowed to have contact with anyone except 
court bailiffs. Only Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito could make exceptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said one of the reasons defense lawyers might oppose the 
sequestration is that they may be afraid that a panel of jurors who could give 
up months of their lives and be away from their families and friends for that 
long would not reflect the diversity of Los Angeles' population. 
</P>
<P>
 Such jurors would typically be older and wealthier, the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Wednesday, Simpson's lawyers filed more papers in support of their 
attempt to get Ito to suppress virtually all of the evidence police took from 
O.J. Simpson's home and automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence the defense wants to suppress includes items police took in two 
searches of Simpson's business office on San Vicente Boulevard, the most recent 
of which was Sept. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Those searches were in connection with a grand jury inquiry into whether Al 
Cowlings tried to help the football great flee from police before his arrest. 
But the defense in its papers insisted police really were looking for evidence 
against Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense lawyers do not yet know what police took in the office searches, 
they said, because they have not received the search warrant affidavits and 
property lists connected with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The papers filed Friday list many items that already have been made public, 
including a right-handed, bloody glove a police detective testified he found at 
Simpson's estate. The court papers also for the first time describe some items 
taken from Simpson's Ford Bronco that are being held by police as evidence. 
They include a note pad and a note with "Nicole" written on them, music tapes, 
business cards and a tape of the Al Pacino movie "Carlito's Way."

DISCOVERY OF BREAST CANCER GENE CALLED MAJOR ADVANCE; MEDICINE: RESEARCHERS 
LOCATE DEFECT THAT CAUSES HALF OF INHERITED CASES. EARLY DETECTION MAY SAVE 
MANY LIVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Utah researchers have identified the defective gene believed to cause about 
half of all inherited cases of breast cancer, a discovery that should make it 
possible within a year to identify the estimated 600,000 American women who 
carry the gene. 
</P>
<P>
 These women have an 85% risk of developing breast cancer by age 65 and an 
unusually high risk of developing ovarian cancer. Identifying the women at risk 
could save many lives by allowing intensive monitoring and early detection of 
the tumors, which substantially increases the cure rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery is the result of a massive effort triggered four years ago when 
geneticist Mary-Claire King of UC Berkeley showed that the gene, commonly 
called BRCA1, is located on a small region of chromosome 17, one of the 23 
pairs of chromosomes that contain every person's genetic blueprint. The race to 
locate the gene was ultimately won by a team of more than 45 scientists headed 
by geneticist Mark H. Skolnick of the University of Utah and Myriad Genetics 
Inc. of Salt Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
 Another team also has identified the approximate location of a second gene, 
BRCA2, that is believed responsible for most of the remaining cases of 
inherited breast cancer in women, possibly many sporadic cases of the disease, 
as well as male breast cancers. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of BRCA1 is a "major advance (that) will enable us to identify 
women, particularly younger women, who have an increased risk of developing 
breast cancer," said molecular biologist Harold Varmus, director of the 
National Institutes of Health. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps even more important, however, will be the new understanding the genes 
provide about how breast cancer occurs, according to Dr. Harmon Eyre, chief 
medical officer of the American Cancer Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually know very little about what causes breast cancer," Eyre said. 
"This is a real first step in getting to the bottom of what it is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 Breast cancer activists were delighted by the discovery, particularly because 
of its potential implications for understanding the biology of the disease, 
said Michelle Rakoff, co-chair of the Los Angeles Breast Cancer Alliance. "What 
we have now is early detection," she said. "What we really want is prevention, 
and for that we need to know what causes it." 
</P>
<P>
 Reports on the breakthrough were scheduled to be published next month in the 
journal Science, but they were released Wednesday after NBC News revealed their 
contents. 
</P>
<P>
 Breast cancer is the most common form of cancer in women, striking an 
estimated 182,000 U.S. women and 1,000 men each year. It is estimated that one 
in every nine women will develop the disease sometime in their lives. The 
five-year-survival rate after treatment for localized breast cancer is 93%, but 
the rate dips to 72% if the disease has spread in the breast region at the time 
of diagnosis and to 18% if the disease has spread to other parts of the body. 
</P>
<P>
 The disease annually kills about 46,000 women and 300 men. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have known for more than 100 years that breast cancer runs in 
families, with this form of the disease accounting for about 5% of all cases. 
The inherited form is physically indistinguishable from sporadic breast cancer, 
but it strikes at an earlier age, with a large proportion of cases occurring in 
women under the age of 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous studies of more than 200 families with the BRCA1 gene have revealed 
that the gene is linked not only to breast and ovarian cancer, but perhaps to 
colon and prostate cancer as well. Both women and men in these families have an 
above-normal rate of colon cancer and men have an excessive amount of prostate 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly identified gene, Skolnick said, is a very large gene "that had no 
similarities to any other gene that we know of until the last segment that we 
found." The structure of that segment suggests that the protein produced from 
the gene binds to DNA within the cell, but the researchers as yet have no idea 
what it does after it binds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most researchers, however, believe that BRCA1 is a tumor suppressor gene -- 
one that normally keeps the replication of cells in check. Skolnick's group is 
working overtime to pinpoint its function when healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is going to be difficult, to say the least, to understand how this gene 
predisposes some women to breast and ovarian cancer," King said. "But no one 
ever said breast or ovarian cancer would be easy to solve." 
</P>
<P>
 Skolnick said it would require at least a year to develop a test for the 
defective gene because researchers need to be sure which mutations cause 
cancer, which are harmless and which are more likely to cause ovarian cancer 
rather than breast tumors. "We want to make sure that if you tell a woman she 
has an elevated risk, it is true," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the size of the gene, a test to detect its presence could cost as 
much as $1,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyre noted that the test will also make it possible to determine when the 
defective gene is not present. In any family with many women, he said, there is 
a significant chance that several will develop breast cancer even though they 
do not carry the gene. In such families, the test should reduce anxiety by 
showing that unaffected members have no unusual risk for breast cancer, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, some women in families with a history of the disease undergo 
prophylactic mastectomies to reduce their risk. If the gene is not present, 
such mastectomies would clearly be unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Skolnick's group has also looked for the gene in several patients with 
sporadic forms of the disease and, to everyone's surprise, was unable to find 
it. "That's completely unexpected," Eyre said. Generally, he said, a gene that 
plays a major role in an inherited form of a disease is also important in 
sporadic cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers have higher hopes that the other gene under study, BRCA2 , will be 
linked to sporadic cases once it has been isolated. 
</P>
<P>
 The approximate location of BRCA2 on chromosome 13 was determined by a team 
headed by molecular biologist Douglas F. Easton of the Institute of Cancer 
Research in London, who studied 15 breast cancer families that do not have 
BRCA1. "We think that BRCA1 accounts for perhaps half of the inherited cases 
and BRCA2 accounts for a good fraction of the rest," he said. "But we think 
there is still another gene to be found." 
</P>
<P>
 Easton and his colleagues -- a team that includes Skolnick's group -- are now 
using the same techniques used in Utah to isolate BRCA2 from among the 
approximately 65 genes located in the small segment of chromosome 13 they 
identified.

BASEBALL SEASON, SERIES CANCELED; SPORTS: OWNERS SAY FAILURE TO REACH 
BARGAINING ACCORD AND 34-DAY PLAYERS' STRIKE MADE IT IMPOSSIBLE TO RESUME PLAY. 
WORLD SERIES WON'T BE PLAYED FOR FIRST TIME SINCE 1904. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting baseball commissioner Bud Selig canceled the rest of the 1994 season 
Wednesday, including the playoffs and the World Series, amid the likelihood 
that the continuing labor dispute will jeopardize the 1995 baseball season as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time since 1904 that the World Series will not be played. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig, owner of the Milwaukee Brewers, said in a news conference at Milwaukee 
County Stadium that the failure to reach a collective bargaining agreement and 
the 34-day strike by the Major League Baseball Players Assn. had made it 
impossible to resume play without substantial conditioning time for the 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ran out of ground," Selig said. "It's tragic, but I wasn't going to allow 
the most important games of the season to become a farce." 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Fehr, executive director of the players' union, said it was all part of 
the owners' plan to break the union through unilateral implementation of a 
salary-cap proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never had any influence (on the negotiations)," Fehr said. "We might as 
well have been wooden Indians." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig said he accepted responsibility for the decision and that 26 of the 28 
clubs had signed a resolution supporting it. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike, which began on Aug. 12, is now destined to become the longest of 
baseball's eight work stoppages since 1972. It erased the last 52 days and 669 
games of what had been one of the most exciting seasons in recent history and 
eclipsed by two days the 1981 strike that wiped out 712 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The players have already lost more than $150 million in salary. The owners, 
who had projected $140 million in postseason TV revenue before advertisers 
began defecting as the strike progressed, may lose more than $600 million in 
gross revenue, according to union estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage to the fan base, however, is incalculable, and Selig said: "You 
would have to be naive, insane or all of the above not to think that we haven't 
been scarred. There are no winners in this. Both sides failed on so many 
fronts. I mean, it's almost impossible to articulate the sense of sadness and 
poignancy I feel today." 
</P>
<P>
 Owner Marge Schott of the Cincinnati Reds refused to sign the resolution, 
Selig said, because she thought the season could have been continued with minor 
league players. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Angelos, owner of the Baltimore Orioles, considered by colleagues to be 
something of a maverick, wrote his own resolution in support of the decision 
and faxed it to Selig. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos removed any references from Selig's resolution that dealt with the 
unwillingness of players to bargain with the clubs in good faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my feeling that making these assertions serves no useful purpose," 
Angelos wrote. "Moreover, the continuation of these claims works at cross 
purposes in trying to bring about a constructive end to this strike. What we 
need to do is reduce the level of rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig said that the industry had to face its economic problems or face 
catastrophic consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this provides the impetus for constructing a solution, then something good 
will have come from it," Selig said. "We have to rebuild the damage and take 
the game to new heights." 
</P>
<P>
 That won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 The union is convinced that the owners' objective is to declare a bargaining 
impasse and unilaterally implement a proposal that would place a cap on 
salaries, eliminate salary arbitration, modify free agency and reduce the 
players' share of total revenue from 58% to 50%, a figure the union says is 
more like 44%. 
</P>
<P>
 If the owners implement the proposal in October, and Selig has insisted that 
no decision has been reached, the union has predicted it will spawn a winter of 
chaos. Among the possibilities: 
</P>
<P>
 * The union may order players not to sign contracts, it may file a default 
grievance aimed at making them all free agents or it may do both. 
</P>
<P>
 * It may complain to the National Labor Relations Board that the owners failed 
to negotiate in good faith and ask that the new system be overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 * It will continue to pursue congressional support for the removal of 
baseball's antitrust exemption and may explore the viability of starting a new 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 * And barring a settlement, the union will definitely resume the strike next 
spring, with the possibility it will not be resolved until midseason. 
</P>
<P>
 "By that point, several of the small-market clubs may have gone under," a 
union lawyer said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Said owners' negotiator Richard Ravitch: "There's tremendous uncertainty 
without a bargaining agreement. I mean, there's a lot of players other than 
Barry Bonds (of the San Francisco Giants) who don't know and won't know if 
they'll have a job. On the other hand, the owners face a tough job marketing, 
promoting and selling tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting on that uncertainty, Selig said: "Time is not an ally of either 
side." 
</P>
<P>
 It is uncertain, however, when the negotiations will resume and what value 
they will serve. 
</P>
<P>
 The sides are polarized ideologically, the players unwilling to accept the 
owners' economic claims or address what the owners consider the primary issues: 
cost control and containment. 
</P>
<P>
 Said union leader Fehr: "I can't see the players ever playing under a salary 
cap they went on strike to resist. I can't see the players accepting any system 
that restricts free agency or serves as a disincentive for the clubs to sign 
players." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr will leave next week to begin a series of regional meetings with the 
players. A management lawyer said Wednesday that the owners may ask the union 
to agree to a 30-day grace period, in which negotiations will continue without 
either side taking legal action. Fehr said he would be willing to discuss it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not rushing off to court," he said. "We'll have due time for that." 
</P>
<P>
 He called Selig's announcement Wednesday "tragic and disappointing" but so 
anticlimactic as to be characteristic of negotiations in which the owners never 
deviated from their plan, never showed a sense of urgency and never went the 
extra yard to reach an agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the result they anticipated all along," he said. "I'm amazed by the 
equanimity with which they've tossed away the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Equanimity or unanimity? 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't help but wonder if this was just a test of the owners' will," Ravitch 
said, raising a familiar theme. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr, however, denied miscalculating the owners' solidarity. He referred to a 
$200-million strike fund built from licensing revenue -- the first 
distributions will be made Friday -- and said: 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it would be rough. We knew it would be hard. We knew it wouldn't be a 
short strike. That's why, individually and collectively, the players amassed a 
large reservoir of funds." 
</P>
<P>
 The money, however, is unlikely to compensate for the Fehr-Selig legacy, the 
cancellation of the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said the immediate personal impact "indicates a failure to get the job 
done. But then, it may have been a job that was impossible to get done." 
</P>
<P>
 He added: "History isn't written by contemporaries. And if it is, it usually 
isn't very good. It seems to me I can predict pretty well what the scholars 
will say 50 to 75 years from now about labor relations in baseball the last 20 
years. What they'll say is, you had a cartel that was exempt from antitrust 
laws and was used to doing whatever it wanted to whomever it wanted under 
whatever conditions it wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "You also had a union that didn't want to let them do that, but as a result of 
the (owners') special privilege, they provoked eight work stoppages. I expect 
historians will say somebody should have understood that the antitrust laws are 
there for a reason." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr also said that he thinks historians will conclude that "it took no small 
amount of courage" for the players, considering the amount of money they are 
losing, to stand firm "and do what's right for themselves and the players that 
come after them. I think when history is written, much more will be said about 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Selig admitted that the media's "Bud bashing" has had an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a history major," he said. "I love history. I tend to view things in 
the context of history, including the World Series, and I worry about the 
reaction -- public and otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like the personal attacks -- who would? One owner said I have to 
regard it all as institutional hits, attacks on the industry at a difficult 
time. Maybe, but it still hurts. At the same time, I know I'd feel even worse 
if I ignored the (economic) problems. They've been repressed for too long." 
</P>
<P>
 The union, disputing the severity of those problems, believes the owners have 
been following a plan initiated when Selig and Chicago White Sox owner Jerry 
Reinsdorf led the overthrow of Commissioner Fay Vincent, who resigned on Sept. 
7, 1992, and no full-time commissioner was selected to succeed him. 
</P>
<P>
 That left a seemingly conflicting situation in which the owner of a 
small-market club that believes it can't survive without a new compensation 
system became acting commissioner, supposedly responsible for the best 
interests of the game, not just his own best interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners voted to reopen collective bargaining negotiations a year early, on 
Dec. 7 of 1992, but did not present their salary-cap proposal to the union 
until 18 months later, by which time they had also approved a new voting rule 
requiring 21 of the 28 clubs to ratify a bargaining agreement, rather than a 
majority. That meant that only eight small-market teams could prevent any 
agreement that did not include a salary cap and increased revenue sharing among 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said Wednesday that the owners have engaged in a show for public 
relations' sake. The goal, he said, has been to break the union and 
unilaterally implement the cap. The strike was the union's only leverage, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, nothing we have said or done has mattered," he added. "Bud 
wants to teach the children a lesson." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Selig: "If anybody thinks this is anything preordained and we had a plan, 
that is just sheer and utter nonsense. Was there a firm conviction that the 
system needed to be changed? Yes. Did it take 14 months of internal debate to 
decide on a plan? Yes. Did that leave a stronger sense of unanimity (among 
owners) and better understanding of each other's finances? Definitely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Were we willing to negotiate with the union? Of course, but the union never 
responded to our need for cost certainty and a system that would control the 
growth of salaries. At this point, there's no sense getting into a debate over 
who has been the most intransigent." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, an American League owner, insisting on anonymity, reflected on 
the owners' tendency to capitulate in the seven previous work stoppages since 
1972 and said: "I'm afraid that some of my colleagues became intoxicated this 
time with the concept of winning, of drawing blood." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, one of the most exciting seasons in baseball history has ended with a 
whimper instead of a bang. Could Tony Gwynn have hit .400? Could Frank Thomas 
have won the triple crown -- the batting average, home run and runs-batted-in 
championships? Could Thomas, Matt Williams or Ken Griffey Jr. have broken Roger 
Maris' record for most home runs in a season? The questions are without 
answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Paul Molitor, the Toronto Blue Jay star and most valuable player in last 
year's World Series: "We (the players and owners) took the most exciting season 
I've seen in my 17 years and wiped it off the board. Who cares who wins or 
loses at the bargaining table? We've done irreparable damage to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a member of the players' negotiating committee, I feel we did everything 
we could to get the negotiations moving in the right direction, but we were 
stonewalled at every turn. We were dealing with an ownership group ready to 
bring only one proposal to the table and forgo the 1994 season, and maybe the 
1995 season as well." 
</P>
<P>
 * RELATED STORIES: B1, C1, C6-C9 No Runs, No Hits, No Season 
</P>
<P>
 On the 34th day of a strike by players, major league owners canceled the 
remainder of the season. The last time the World Series was canceled was 1904; 
the last time the regular season was cut short was in 1918, during World War I. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dispute: The key conflict was a dispute over the owners' insistence on a 
cap on player salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Future: It is unclear when negotiations resume. The players, who lost 28% 
of their 1994 salaries, won't feel further financial impact until April, when 
paychecks would resume if the season began normally.

THE TIMES POLL; FEINSTEIN CLINGS TO SLIM LEAD OVER HUFFINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican Senate challenger Mike Huffington has done significant damage to 
Sen. Dianne Feinstein's public image, but after months of television 
commercials attacking her, the incumbent Democrat still holds a tenuous lead in 
a new Los Angeles Times poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein was 6 points ahead of Huffington -- 49% to 43% -- among those voters 
who said they were most likely to cast a ballot on Election Day. Her lead was a 
bit wider among all of the state's registered voters, with 49% backing 
Feinstein compared to 40% for Huffington, a freshman congressman from Santa 
Barbara. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under this relentless barrage, she has managed to stay ahead," said Times 
Poll Director John Brennan. "But this race is close and she can't be 
complacent." 
</P>
<P>
 Just last March, the Times Poll found that Feinstein was the most popular 
lawmaker in California, with nearly two-thirds of the state's voters reporting 
a favorable impression of the former San Francisco mayor. Most voters also said 
she was performing well in Washington. And she held a 30- point lead over 
Huffington, causing pundits to rate her a strong bet for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, however, Huffington has pounded the incumbent in a relentless 
television attack. By May her lead had dropped to 52% to 38%. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Feinstein's favorable rating among the electorate has plummeted to 42% 
and voters are almost evenly split on whether she is doing a good job in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington's focus on Feinstein, however, has done little to establish his own 
image with many voters. As a result, 54% of voters -- including almost half of 
Huffington's own supporters -- still say they don't know him well enough to 
have a favorable or unfavorable opinion. The rest of the voters were split 
evenly -- 23% on each side -- between a favorable view of Huffington and an 
unfavorable one. 
</P>
<P>
 That enigmatic image is also reflected in the reasons that his supporters said 
they back his campaign. The top response was "nothing in particular, just like 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because she is better known, Feinstein's supporters were also more 
certain of their choice in candidates. Only a quarter of the Feinstein voters 
said they might switch to someone else; a third of Huffington's supporters said 
they were not firmly committed. 
</P>
<P>
 The poll findings -- both Feinstein's sliding image and Huffington's lack of 
an image -- portend a race that is likely to be close and hard-fought. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll surveyed 1,165 registered voters, including 721 who said they 
were likely to cast a ballot in November. It was the first time that the poll 
has studied likely voters in this race. The margin of sampling error for 
registered voters was 3 points either way, and it was 4 points either way for 
likely voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey examined one of the flash points in the contest between Huffington 
and Feinstein -- that of the insider versus the outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has campaigned as an experienced lawmaker and vigorous advocate for 
California, a record that Huffington has derided as that of a career 
politician. Huffington, meanwhile, has run as a former business executive and 
political newcomer seeking to shake up Washington. Feinstein's campaign has 
responded that he is inexperienced and ineffective. 
</P>
<P>
 In the poll, Feinstein appeared to come out ahead in the debate. "Even in 
these cynical, anti-Washington times, many see the advantage of having a 
seasoned politician with clout," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voters were asked to choose what type of senator they would rather have in 
Washington, "an experienced politician who knows how to get things from 
Washington for Californians, or a political outsider who thinks Washington 
should play a smaller role in Californians' lives." By 49% to 31%, voters 
picked the former. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's record in politics was a decisive issue for both her supporters 
and her opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 More than anything else, Feinstein voters said they backed her because she has 
been an effective senator. Among the other major reasons was her performance as 
mayor of San Francisco and her experience. The same reasons -- her performance 
in the Senate and in San Francisco -- were among the top responses that 
Feinstein's critics gave for opposing her. 
</P>
<P>
 The senator's two hallmark pieces of legislation -- the assault weapons ban 
that passed recently and the pending Desert Protection Act -- were mentioned by 
only a few respondents from both sides of the race. 
</P>
<P>
 A major factor in Huffington's standing was opinions about his money. The 
Republican nominee has spent more than $10 million on the campaign from a 
fortune that he gained in the 1990 sale of his family's Texas petroleum 
company. Feinstein, also a millionaire, has raised about $6.5 million for her 
campaign from contributors. 
</P>
<P>
 After "nothing in particular," the second most popular reason for having a 
favorable opinion of the Republican was the candidate's willingness to spend 
his own money and the fact that he does not rely on special interest 
contributions. The money was also the prime target of his detractors, many of 
whom said Huffington is trying to buy the election. 
</P>
<P>
 But among all voters, the survey indicated that Huffington's use of his own 
money may cause him limited damage. When respondents were asked whether they 
are more or less likely to vote for Huffington because he is spending his own 
money, nearly two-thirds said it will not make a difference. Slightly more 
voters said it would cause them to oppose his candidacy than to support it (20% 
to 15%). 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's connections to President Clinton had a similar drag on her 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's image in California has dropped from 59% favorable in March to 
just 44% in the most recent poll. Almost half of the respondents said they 
disapprove of Clinton's job performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has sought to tie Feinstein's fortunes to the President, citing her 
support for some of his programs, particularly the controversial 1993 budget 
package. Almost a third of the crucial independent voters said they would be 
less likely to vote for a congressional candidate who is a big supporter of 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 But the poll found that almost half of all respondents said the Clinton 
connection does not matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I characterize Clinton as a marginal drag on her," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, the President's sagging image is just part of a changing political 
landscape in California that is more hostile to Democrats than the one they 
faced in 1992 when the party carried the White House and the state's two U.S. 
Senate seats. 
</P>
<P>
 That year, the Times Poll found that the Democrats were considered the party 
best able to handle problems. Now, Republicans have won that label by a narrow 
margin. 
</P>
<P>
 There is evidence in the poll that Huffington has benefited from the shift. 
Independent voters, who favored Feinstein almost 2 to 1 in May, are now almost 
evenly split between the two candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has also lost ground among elderly voters, a crucial group whose 
reliability is particularly important when turnout on Election Day is low. 
Feinstein had a 22-point lead among voters over age 65 last May; that dropped 
to just 6 points in the latest survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the slippage, Feinstein maintained her lead among most demographic 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographically, one of Huffington's stronger categories was upper-income 
voters. Among those earning more than $60,000 in annual salaries, the race is a 
dead heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also has more weakness in his Republican base than Feinstein does 
among Democrats. Feinstein was supported by 38% of non-conservative Republican 
voters while Huffington was winning 27% of non-liberal Democrats. How the Poll 
Was Conducted 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll interviewed 1,503 adults statewide, by telephone, Sept. 8-11. 
Included in the sample were 1,165 registered voters and 721 likely voters. 
Telephone numbers were chosen from a list of all exchanges in the state. 
Random-digit dialing techniques were used so that listed and unlisted numbers 
could be contacted. Interviews were in English and Spanish. The sample was 
weighted slightly to conform more closely with census figures for sex, race, 
age and education. The margin of sampling error for the total and 
registered-voter samples is plus or minus 3 percentage points; for likely 
voters it is 4 points. For certain subgroups, the error margin may be somewhat 
higher. Poll results can also be affected by factors such as the wording of 
questions and the order in which they are presented. The Senate Race 
</P>
<P>
 In the race for U.S. Senate Democrat Dianne Feinstein holds a 6-point edge 
over GOP challenger Mike Huffington among likely voters. 
</P>

COLUMN ONE; THE DEFIANT RETURN TO CHIAPAS; PRO-GOVERNMENT CHAMULA INDIANS FOR 
DECADES VIOLENTLY EXPELLED VILLAGERS WHO DARED TO DIFFER. THOUSANDS SEEMED TO 
ACCEPT THEIR FATE -- UNTIL NOW.

 Josefina Hernandez Gomez did not have much to go home to. On the day last year 
when she and her extended family were driven into exile, Hernandez's hateful 
neighbors burned their tiny houses and stole the chickens and sheep. The 
unattended radish and corn crops rotted. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hernandez and her family, defying threats of death, did return. They sleep 
in the fertilizer shed while starting to rebuild. 
</P>
<P>
 "They burned everything. Our mattresses. The Singer sewing machine," says 
Hernandez, a 26-year-old Mayan mother with a baby slung over her back and two 
daughters at her feet. "They threw us out because we believed in God." 
</P>
<P>
 For two decades, powerful pro-government Chamula Indian leaders in this 
fertile, isolated swath of southern Mexico's Chiapas state have violently 
expelled members of their pious, conservative community who dared to differ. 
Those who converted to Protestantism or, worse, to opposition politics -- those 
who challenged the established order in any way -- were cast out. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 25,000 people, more than a third of the community's population of 
70,000, have been expelled, according to human rights activists. And all seemed 
to accept their fate, until now. 
</P>
<P>
 Inspired by a Mayan rebellion earlier this year that shook Mexico to the core, 
hundreds of Chamula exiles have taken matters into their own hands and for the 
first time are returning home. 
</P>
<P>
 Their perilous action reflects a new militancy among Indians here that may be 
the most significant legacy of the Zapatista National Liberation Army, the 
rebel band whose Jan. 1 uprising sounded the call for democracy and indigenous 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The return challenges the traditional leaders, known as caciques , who run San 
Juan Chamula and other Indian towns in southern Mexico like small fiefdoms. And 
ultimately, it challenges the ironclad way Mexico's ruling party has controlled 
this rural region for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not so easy anymore for the government to cover the sun with a finger," 
said Domingo Lopez Angel, one of the first Chamulas to be expelled in 1974 and 
now an opposition activist. "The Indian is rising up. We will no longer let 
ourselves be fooled. We have seen (a change), thanks to our Zapatista 
companeros , who had the courage to awaken the country." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chamula are one of several Mayan clans who live in the Chiapas highlands 
of southern Mexico, each with its distinctive customs and dress. The Chamula 
women, for example, wear embroidered blouses and black blankets wrapped as 
skirts; the men wear black or white sheepskin tunics. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1960s, an arrangement has existed between the authoritarian Indian 
caciques and the regional bosses from Mexico's ruling Institutional 
Revolutionary Party (PRI), who found they could control the indigenous 
communities by buying off their leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The caciques benefited from government patronage, including land grants, and 
were allowed to make money, build empires and manage their towns as they saw 
fit. In exchange, the caciques provided unanimous vote counts for the PRI at 
every election. 
</P>
<P>
 As time went on, the Chamula leaders saw any change as a threat to their 
traditions, their community and their hold on power and wealth. San Juan 
Chamula earned a reputation as a place hostile to all outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Chamula conflict is often portrayed as a holy war between Roman 
Catholics and Protestants, it is, in fact, more complex. Religion, politics and 
economics are inextricably intertwined. 
</P>
<P>
 The leaders have said the exiles were expelled because they had become 
born-again Christians whose religion threatens the syncretic brand of 
Catholicism practiced in San Juan Chamula and the community's traditional 
dress, ceremonies and customs. Many of the exiles, as well as anthropologists 
and other experts, say religion is being used as a pretext for expelling 
political dissidents and nonconformists. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Chamulas to be expelled in the early 1970s were taken in by American 
missionaries in the region; many were converted to Protestant faiths. They 
settled in shantytowns on the outskirts of the nearest city, San Cristobal de 
las Casas, towns with names like Bethlehem and New Jerusalem. The largest, 
which climbs the side of a muddy hill, is called The Ant. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have converted reject many of the rituals the caciques demand. 
Members of the Chamula community are required to supply expensive religious 
festivals with thousands of candles, gallons of Coca-Cola and Pepsi Cola, and 
moonshine called "pash," which is consumed in large quantities. 
</P>
<P>
 Not coincidentally, the caciques and their lieutenants control the 
distributorships for all the items required in the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted us to buy the booze," Hernandez said in broken Spanish, switching 
to her native Tzotzil language to speak to her relatives. "They like people to 
get drunk." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez's father, Juan Hernandez Heredia, owns four plots of land here on 
the sweeping hillsides of Cuchuluntic, a hamlet that is part of the larger San 
Juan Chamula municipio , or county. The Hernandezes say they were expelled 
because of their religious beliefs and because they refused to go along with 
the ceremonies -- but several posters for an opposition candidate hang on their 
fertilizer shed. 
</P>
<P>
 Last September, a woman from the town came to warn them. If they didn't leave 
by the morning, they would be dead. They knew others before had been killed, 
the women raped. The Hernandez family fled to the nearby hills and waited until 
dusk. As neighbors doused the Hernandez property with gasoline, the family 
walked for three hours to San Cristobal, joining 580 Chamulas expelled during a 
four-month period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike the thousands who had gone before them, the group decided to fight. 
First they occupied the San Cristobal headquarters of the federal government's 
Indigenous Affairs Office. Then, taking their cue from the Zapatista rebel 
leader known as Subcommander Marcos, and to the shock of the caciques and the 
regional PRI leaders, the Chamulas in July kidnaped Domingo Lopez Ruiz, the 
mayor and a principal cacique of San Juan Chamula. Two people were killed in a 
shootout to free the mayor, who was freed later. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican government, already badly shaken by the Zapatista uprising that 
left 145 people dead and focused international attention on the plight of 
Mexico's impoverished Mayans, was eager to negotiate. The government paid the 
exiles $150,000 for their lost crops, and is considering awarding $70,000 more 
for property damage. Still, no formal agreement for their return was reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhausted and frustrated, the exiles decided to forgo further negotiations and 
test their luck. Two days before national elections last month, more than 500 
people rounded up their few remaining sheep, boarded government trucks and went 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez Heredia said he and his family were greeted with "silence" from the 
neighbors, but no violence so far. This time, however, they are prepared: Using 
some of their reparation money, they bought walkie-talkies and set up a warning 
system among the returned exiles. This time, they say, they will defend 
themselves if neighbors or the caciques' henchmen come after them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marcos encouraged us to organize well," Hernandez Heredia, 48, said, standing 
by the charred wood and crumpled bricks of his old home. "If they come back to 
attack us, it will not be the same as before. We have weapons -- stones, 
slingshots, sticks. We are ready. The time we would let ourselves be stepped on 
like mice is over. We are not afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 He paused to speak on the walkie-talkie in Tzotzil to a fellow returnee down 
the road. They are hoping to raise enough money through their church and 
elsewhere to buy more radio units. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Chamulas are successful in returning and defying the traditional power 
structure, they could force permanent changes in their local government. And 
gradually, the PRI's absolute control of the region could begin to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes so far are incremental. In the Aug. 21 voting for president and 
other offices, a real election was held in San Juan Chamula for the first time. 
In previous years, the caciques did not allow opposition political parties or 
independent election monitors into town; the entire community voted as one, and 
always for the PRI. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, representatives of other parties were present on voting day. The 
PRI's margin declined to 85% of the vote. A small victory, but a start, say the 
returning exiles. Hernandez and his family could not participate, however, 
because their voter-identification cards had been burned when their homes were 
destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking with remarkable candor, Gustavo Moscoso, the regional head of 
indigenous affairs for the Mexican government, said much of the problem in San 
Juan Chamula and other Indian villages has been the complicity between PRI 
party bosses and the caciques . Government officials rarely dared challenge the 
cacique rule as long as the PRI votes kept coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Those days are ending, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Mexico, we are living through a change," said Moscoso, who assumed his job 
in February, after the governor of Chiapas and his administration were fired in 
the wake of the Zapatista rebellion. "The indigenous communities now know what 
their rights are and that laws exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts argue the caciques ' fear of the onslaught of evangelism has some 
justification. As the population grows and land becomes scarce, the new 
religions have eroded some traditions that Chamulas had fiercely guarded since 
Friar Bartolome de las Casas converted them to Catholicism in the 16th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "They see Chamula as a fragile vessel, that their way of life is contained in 
it . . . (and) that they were handed this vessel by their ancient ancestors," 
said Jan Rus, an anthropologist from Claremont, Calif., who has written 
extensively on the Chamulas. "They see it in their language, in the saints they 
venerate, in their territory." 
</P>
<P>
 But Rus and others say that in recent years the expulsions took on a more 
violent, witch-hunt tone that clearly targeted dissidents and reformists. 
</P>
<P>
 To describe the Chamula conflict as a religious one oversimplifies it. Still, 
the religious practices of the two sides offer stark contrast and highlight 
their basic differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the brand-new neon-blue Tzotzil Independent Pentecostal Evangelical 
Church in Paradise, an exile colony on the outskirts of San Cristobal, hundreds 
of Chamula men and women crowded onto rough wooden pews on a recent evening for 
hours of prayer, gospel and song. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the women and all of the men had forgone their native Indian dress for 
slacks, shirts and dresses -- indicative, the caciques would say, of lost 
culture. They knelt on the dirt floor and bowed deeply in prayer, chanting and 
moaning. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonstop preacher stomped, clapped and shouted, Bible in one hand, an organ 
and trap drum set alongside him. The long sermons were in Tzotzil, dotted 
frequently with words in Spanish: "Brothers!" "Hallelujah!" and "Amen!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Depart from evil, and do good; so shall you abide forever," the preacher read 
from the Bible. "For the Lord loves justice; he will not forsake his saints. . 
. . The righteous shall possess the land, and dwell upon it forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the church elders sat facing the wall, sobbing in prayer. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in San Juan Chamula, the Catholic Church is unusual, to say the least. It 
is central to a practice that combines Mayan mystical beliefs with Roman 
Catholic traditions. The Catholic diocese in San Cristobal pulled the priest 
from the church in the late 1970s because it did not want to be associated with 
the expulsions. So worship is personal and individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Large signs outside the church warn visitors not to take pictures. Inside, on 
a recent morning, incense filled the air and pine needles covered the floor, 
both smells combining with the distinctive waft of cane liquor. 
</P>
<P>
 Indian men and women sat on the floor in groups throughout the chapel, which 
has no pews. They prayed to dozens of saints, bedecked in silk and mirrors and 
standing in glass boxes. Each group of worshipers had placed before it dozens, 
sometimes more than 100, candles of all sizes and colors. They also laid out 
bottles of Coke or Pepsi, containers of pash and eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman held a red-brown chicken by the legs, passing it over the candles, 
then over the body of a younger woman seated by her. She held the chicken 
upside down until it died, then she placed it with the candles. The man next to 
her struggled to wring the neck of a speckled rooster, which squawked until it 
died, as the man steadily murmured his prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the Chamula exiles, politically speaking, they are something of an 
anomaly. Pentecostal faiths have made inroads throughout Latin America, but 
they are usually attached to conservative movements. The Chamula evangelicals, 
on the contrary, are essentially revolutionaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthropologist Rus describes the phenomenon as a historical accident. The 
exiles, even as converts, never lost their political goals of changing the 
Chamula government. Their ties to the Zapatistas are natural, since both groups 
emerge from the same community, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Chamula exiles, there are other signs of new militancy. 
Indians throughout Chiapas have seized vast acreage since the Zapatista 
uprising; even the charcoal peddlers of San Cristobal have adopted the 
Zapatista name and are fighting for a better location at the local market. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are realizing their community doesn't serve their needs," Rus said. 
"They are forging new organizations and getting a sense of themselves as 
Indians in a caste system. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does that lead to? I don't know. Native people want space. The question 
is, how much are the (elite) willing to cede power? . . . (The Indians) have 
always thought about how poor they were, how the government screwed them. Then 
it just suddenly sort of bloomed, and the Zapatistas were the catalyst for 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "That consciousness has an expression now," Rus said. "It's mystical to watch. 
It's like blacks in the South, when they realized (the civil rights movement) 
might actually work."

CANCELLATION IS BLOW TO FANS, BIG A WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 While baseball fans wonder whether Matt Williams could have broken Roger 
Maris' home-run record or if Frank Thomas could have won the Triple Crown or if 
they'll ever forgive major leaguers enough to attend another game, Trent 
Breitenbucher wonders whether he'll ever return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 The baseball strike and subsequent cancellation of the season Wednesday not 
only cost Breitenbucher his job selling souvenir programs at Angels games, he 
also lost his day job in the team's customer service department, where he had 
worked for the last seven seasons -- a very cruel Angels double play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm getting unemployment now," said Breitenbucher, a 45-year-old Corona 
resident who earned more than $2,000 a month from both jobs. "Financially, it 
certainly has been a setback for us, quite a loss of income. I have to be 
concerned about my family and their welfare. Meanwhile, we have a bunch of 
millionaires arguing against billionaires." 
</P>
<P>
 The players have already lost more than $150 million in salary and baseball 
owners may lose more than $600 million in revenue because of the strike, but 
the biggest losers are people like Breitenbucher and the other 1,100 temporary 
employees of Anaheim Stadium who are out of work, and the baseball fans who 
live for the excitement of September pennant races and October playoff and 
World Series games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disgusting, and as a fan I feel cheated," said Mark Tuerffs, a 
38-year-old Yorba Linda resident and longtime Angels season ticket holder. "I 
don't know where I am. I can't go out on my patio at night and hear (Dodger 
announcer) Vin Scully. . . . I'm a rotisserie league player with nothing to do. 
I've had to concentrate on my family and work. It's been a miserable summer!" 
</P>
<P>
 At least Tuerffs still has his job as partner of an Orange County food and 
beverage flavoring manufacturing company. Richard Geske, a 43-year-old Brea 
resident, hasn't been so fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 Geske spent the last three years juggling two jobs during the baseball season, 
rushing from Unocal Corp., where he was a researcher, to Anaheim Stadium, where 
he was an Angels usher. The baseball strike eliminated his supplemental income, 
and Geske found out last week that he'll be losing his Unocal job because his 
research unit is being sold to a private company. 
</P>
<P>
 "The stadium had just been a fun thing, but now I look at it as income that 
would have really helped," Geske said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most stadium employees -- ticket sellers, ushers, parking lot attendants, 
concession stand workers -- still get to work home games for the Los Angeles 
Rams. But many said Wednesday that 10 football games do not begin to make up 
for the last 21 games of the baseball season that they will miss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of broke," said 20-year-old college student Dina Tasso, who said she 
makes $35 to $100 a night selling popcorn, peanuts and candy at a mobile 
concession stand. "This is my only job, period. It's the only job I've ever 
had. I was hoping it wouldn't come to this. It makes me mad." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Carr, a 69-year-old Santa Ana resident and retired Marine Corps sergeant, 
has worked as a parking lot attendant for 11 years, earning $30 a game. He is 
angry about the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're losing our jobs and this is supplemental income for us old guys on 
Social Security," Carr said. "Why should these players get millions? I don't 
think these guys are worth it."

 It's certainly not the first time baseball has alienated the public. There 
have been eight major league work stoppages since 1972, including the 50-day 
strike of 1981, which wiped out 712 games, and the 32-day spring training 
lockout of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Many fans said they'd never come back after the 1981 strike, and many 
threatened to boycott games after the 1990 lockout, but they still flocked to 
stadiums, setting attendance records almost every year throughout the 1980s and 
early '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is the first time in 90 years that the World Series, America's most 
revered sporting tradition, will not be played, and some believe the 
cancellation will cause irreparable harm to the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this will tick a lot of people off," said Ricky Kikuchi, a 
27-year-old financial analyst from Chino Hills. "It seems like neither side is 
going to budge, and I'm tired of it. The game has changed way too much." 
</P>
<P>
 But will fans come back? 
</P>
<P>
 "Personally, I hope not, but it seems there are more fans than there is good 
sense," said Dave Coombs, a 48-year-old Anaheim resident who owns three Orange 
County bike shops. "I've been an Angel season ticket holder for 15 years, and 
I'll probably go back because I'd never be able to get seats as good as I have 
now." 
</P>
<P>
 So will Horace Hertz, a 45-year-old partner of an Irvine accounting firm, but 
not because of his love for the game. Asked Wednesday if he cared that the 
baseball season was ending, he said, "Yeah, about as much as I care that Yasser 
Arafat is sick today. I just don't even care. This whole thing is absurd. I'm 
totally indifferent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I follow baseball, I've had Angel season tickets for 15 years, and the only 
reason I won't give up my seats is because my son likes going to the games. 
Otherwise I'd cancel them tomorrow morning." 
</P>
<P>
 Tuerffs said he'll be back too. He and neighbor George Stubblefield, a 
38-year-old area sales manager, still have eight more stadiums to visit in what 
has become an eight-year quest to see all 28 major league parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'm on strike too," Tuerffs said. "I'm not going to wear any major league 
merchandise -- no caps, T-shirts, nothing. As long as this greed and the strike 
goes on, I don't care if both sides get hammered." 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Ryan, a 36-year-old real estate executive and longtime Angels fan from 
Fullerton, thinks Wednesday's decision to cancel the playoffs and World Series 
may actually help baseball in the long run. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had resumed the season now there would have been real low turnouts at 
games, and it would have just added fuel to the fire that people are tired of 
baseball," Ryan said. "I do think people are burned out on baseball this year, 
and it would have come back on real weak footing. 
</P>
<P>
 "But time heals all wounds. If they can settle this thing in the off-season I 
think people will come back in spring training."

CAPITOL JOURNAL: WALKING THE BORDERLINE ON IMMIGRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEORGE SKELTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Latino leader abruptly reminded Treasurer Kathleen Brown Tuesday why, for 
her, the issue of illegal immigration is another big loser. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode showed why immigration -- as well as crime -- are topics that, for 
her own sake, the less said the better until after Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, in her words, had just spoken "from my heart and from my head and from 
my gut" about illegal immigration to the prestigious Commonwealth Club of San 
Francisco. She called illegal immigration "a serious problem" -- a statement 
aimed at rectifying a previous blunder -- and outlined "fair-minded, smart" 
solutions: Beefing up border patrols, penalizing employers, issuing 
tamper-proof Social Security cards, suing Washington and deporting felons. 
</P>
<P>
 But she painted a sharp contrast between herself and Gov. Pete Wilson, whom 
she accused of "fanning fears." Unlike Wilson, Brown adamantly opposes 
Proposition 187 and formally came out against it in her Commonwealth speech. 
Wilson probably will officially endorse the initiative this weekend at a 
Republican state convention in San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would deny illegal immigrants most government services, including 
education. It also contains a snitch clause requiring public officials to 
report suspected illegal immigrants to the INS. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown called the measure "a cheap political trick that Pete Wilson is 
promoting and encouraging and inflaming." It's "mean-spirited and wrongheaded" 
and punishes innocent children, she said. And she wondered how someone might 
become suspect. "By the color of their skin? By the accent? The last name 
maybe? Maybe the way you dress? Maybe the cut of the cloth you're wearing?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic gubernatorial candidate was walking a tight line: Siding with 
the 70% of registered voters -- according to the latest Times poll -- who 
regard illegal immigration as a major problem, while courting Latinos whose 
help she'll need to beat the front-running governor. 
</P>
<P>
 When she took audience questions and got a query from the Latino, Brown was 
jarred with the realization that her path likely is going nowhere, though not 
to follow it would mean sliding over a political cliff. For her to back 
Proposition 187 -- and cozy up to the 62% of likely voters who support it -- 
would be the pinnacle of cynicism. But there's nothing she can do to satisfy 
many Latino leaders on immigration short of minimizing the entire issue and 
jumping off that cliff. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a second-generation Hispanic, I'm personally disappointed at the lack of 
sensitivity that encourages immigrant-bashing by all candidates," read the 
written question. "The war on illegal immigration is destroying a lot of trust 
and initiative among legal Hispanic citizens. How will you gain the trust of 
Hispanic citizens any more than Gov. Wilson?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Well," Brown replied slowly, with a sigh. "That was very much what my remarks 
were intended to do today . . . in thoughtful terms." Looking disheartened, she 
summarized her long speech, again attacked Wilson, then her voice tailed off. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, I found the questioner. He was Anthony U. Martinez, 50, a business 
management professor at University of San Francisco and a board member of the 
Commonwealth Club. He's also a Republican. But he'll likely vote for Brown, 
Martinez added, because her Administration would have more diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, he was critical of Brown. "All candidates have gotten on the 
bandwagon," he said. "All the problems of our economy are being blamed on 
illegal immigration. She ought to raise the bigger issue of competitiveness. . 
. . It's very upsetting. Hispanics are being used as a target." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown actually has talked repeatedly about making California more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I've heard many Latinos -- politicians and activists -- express similar 
sentiments. But they may be out of step with their communities. The Times poll 
found that 61% of Latino voters consider illegal immigration a major problem. 
Still, Brown needs the leaders to drum up enthusiasm for her in these Latino 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 She's done about all she can do. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, she committed one of her biggest campaign errors trying to please 
Latino leaders one year ago. She met with dozens at her home to preview a 
speech attacking illegal immigration. Their unhappiness prompted her to insert 
a line about illegal immigration being "wrongly seen as a cause" of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson jumped on it. Brown accused him of taking her words out of context. 
But, in truth, it was Brown herself who put confusing out-of-context words in 
her speech. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown should now focus on other areas, such as the one where she outscores 
Wilson every time: education.

LAW ON DISRUPTING WORSHIP DRAWS FIRE; RELIGION: MEASURE DOUBLES MAXIMUM 
PENALTY. CIVIL LIBERTARIANS AND GAYS SAY IT WILL STIFLE DISSENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Lou Sheldon figured he was stepping into the lion's den, but he 
didn't expect this. 
</P>
<P>
 The ubiquitous leader of the Orange County-based Traditional Values Coalition 
was preparing to deliver a talk one evening last September at a Baptist church 
in San Francisco when more than 100 gay rights activists descended on the 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 It quickly got ugly. The protesters, incensed by Sheldon's well-publicized 
attacks on gays, drowned out the service with shouts. A few tried to kick in a 
door. Others taunted parishioners through the windows. Riot police were called. 
Sheldon and the others had to be ushered through the crowd by the armed 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismayed by the confrontation, and aware that similar protests have 
interrupted church services at Santa Ana's Calvary Chapel and other 
conservative Christian enclaves, Sheldon turned to a trusted friend in the 
Legislature for help. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is a new law written by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) 
that doubles the penalty for disrupting a church service, carrying a sentence 
of up to a year in jail. Protests at church services, Ferguson said, "tear into 
the very heart of an individual's freedom to worship." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson's measure, signed recently by Gov. Pete Wilson, continues to draw the 
anger of civil libertarians and gay rights supporters who are galled by what 
they consider preferential treatment for fundamentalist Christians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Political protests happen against all sorts of gatherings -- against abortion 
clinics, you name it," said Cathy Dreyfuss, legislative advocate for California 
Attorneys for Criminal Justice. "What Lou Sheldon and his bunch are saying is 
that they should be more protected against a demonstration than any other 
meeting. That's contrary to what America stands for." 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also question whether the measure, which goes into effect Jan. 1, will 
have a chilling effect on their freedom to dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think any of it will hold up in court," said Matthew Sharp, a 
spokesman for ACT-UP Golden Gate, a San Francisco-based gay rights group that 
deals mostly with the AIDS issue. "It's really too much; it's unfair and it 
violates free speech." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp conceded that some of the activists who protested Sheldon's appearance 
at Hamilton Square Baptist Church "got out of hand," but he said the outburst 
was a reaction to continued rhetorical assaults by the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing things their Scripture tells them not to do," Sharp said. 
"Their interpretation of life is that there's only one way to live. We've had 
to deal with a lack of compassion from these churches and their leaders. After 
a while, you get so frustrated and angry, you have to take it to the streets." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon, however, takes the same facts and gives them a decidedly different 
spin. Noting that politicians have been making strides to keep anti-abortion 
protesters from blocking family planning clinics, Sheldon suggests that his new 
law is simply fair play in the nation's ongoing cultural war. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the pro-lifers can't block the abortion clinic, then homosexuals can't 
block the church," he said. "It's now a level playing field." 
</P>
<P>
 He also argued that the demonstrators who interrupted his visit to San 
Francisco went well beyond 1st Amendment rights to free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 "For them to stand in the street and yell would have been fine," he said. "But 
when they tried to break the doors down, when they smashed church property, 
when they laid down on the sidewalk, they blew it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon originally hoped for a law allowing prosecutors to charge church 
demonstrators with a felony punishable by several years in state prison. 
Ferguson, however, decided to press a softer approach for fear the bill would 
be killed right out of the chute by the Democrat-dominated Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The new law keeps church protests -- defined as willfully disturbing a 
religious gathering with profane discourse, rude or indecent behavior or 
unnecessary noise -- a misdemeanor, as it has been in California since 1872. 
But it doubled the jail time and community service punishment. As an option to 
jail, a judge can order up to 80 hours of community service for a first offense 
and a maximum of 160 hours for a subsequent violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon said he is pleased with the law, although he still hopes the 
Legislature will go further in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 "You take what you can get in this Legislature with (Assembly Speaker) Willie 
Brown and company in charge," Sheldon said. "Whatever you get is considered a 
miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a scene that Sheldon described as a melee last year in San Francisco, 
only one arrest was reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheldon contends that the new law, along with public pressure, will prompt 
police to make more arrests the next time. 
</P>
<P>
 To help make his point, Sheldon held a demonstration of his own in San 
Francisco last November. Along with more than 400 other ministers, he marched 
from the Hamilton Square Baptist Church to a Board of Supervisors meeting. 
Along the way, Sheldon and the ministers were confronted by gay rights 
activists, a few sporting Mohawks or outfitted in Speedo swimsuits and little 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we got to City Hall, there were about 75 screaming, yelling, half-naked 
homosexuals," Sheldon said. "I gave my three minutes before the supervisors and 
the homosexuals went bonkers." 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during his speech, a gay man strode up to Sheldon and spit on 
him. Sheldon pointed the man out to police and watched as officers dragged him 
away. 
</P>
<P>
 Local news cameras and a video team from the Christian Broadcasting Network 
recorded it all. Supervisor Carole Migden, who is openly gay, later dismissed 
Sheldon's appearance as "a well-orchestrated publicity stunt."

FIRE VICTIMS PRESS WILSON ON INSURANCE RIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Policyholders who have complained of insurance company delays in paying claims 
from the Oakland and Altadena fires brought pressure Wednesday on Gov. Pete 
Wilson to sign the so-called "Homeowner's Bill of Rights" sponsored by the 
Democratic candidate for insurance commissioner, state Sen. Art Torres of Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 At two news conferences, with Torres at their side, the homeowners complained 
that the governor has declined to meet with them to discuss the merits of the 
measure. It would mandate that all homeowner policies be written in 
uncomplicated language and require companies to go to court to justify 
questions they seek to ask policyholders under oath. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, meanwhile, said he is willing to give credit to Wilson for being "a 
captive of consumers" rather than "a captive of the insurance industry, as are 
so many Republicans," if only the Republican governor will sign the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In a full-page ad appearing in today's national editions of the New York 
Times, homeowner and consumer backers of the measure exhort Wilson not to "turn 
(his) back on 7 million homeowners!" Wilson, the ad states, "has a chance to 
rise above the inertia of partisan politics" by signing the Torres measure. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Wilson said Wednesday that the governor has not yet made up 
his mind whether to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres' Republican opponent in the insurance commissioner's race, Assemblyman 
Charles W. Quackenbush (R-Cupertino), voted against the measure, and a 
spokesman, Greg Butler, said the assemblyman considers it "a bad bill . . . 
because it would encourage fraud" against the companies. 
</P>
<P>
 At one of Wednesday's news conferences, in Pasadena, a homeowner who lost his 
dwelling to the Altadena fire last year said he got some insight into 
Quackenbush's thinking while attending a June 8 legislative hearing on the bill 
in Sacramento. Bert Tibbet, who has not yet secured an insurance settlement on 
his loss, said that after the session ended, Quackenbush "clapped insurance 
lobbyists on the back and congratulated them" for opposing Torres' bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler responded, "If the guy's got a tape, let him produce the tape" to 
verify such an incident. Otherwise, he declined comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Butler charged, it is inappropriate for Torres to accuse Quackenbush of 
being a captive of insurers. He pointed out that Tuesday night a Los Angeles 
law firm that has represented insurance companies was host of a $250-per-person 
fund-raiser for Torres. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm, Buchalter, Nemer, Fields & Younger, has former Insurance 
Commissioner Roxani Gillespie in its office, Butler noted. Gillespie, a 
Republican, championed insurance industry causes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the reception Torres said that despite the law firm's fund raising on his 
behalf, he does not agree with the insurance industry on all issues.

MOORPARK LOSING ITS LATINO ROOTS; GROWTH: CENSUS DATA SHOWS THAT THE ONETIME 
FARMING COMMUNITY IS GAINING WHITE POPULATION. LONGTIME RESIDENTS MOURN THE 
PASSING OF MEXICAN AMERICAN CELEBRATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HADLY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There was a time when women in black scarves called rebozos would line Charles 
Street in Moorpark, following a procession for the feast of Our Lady of 
Guadalupe. 
</P>
<P>
 The tiny farming community used to regularly hold fiestas, its streets coming 
alive on Mexican Independence Day and Cinco de Mayo. But that was a generation 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark is now one of the few California cities where Latino residents make 
up a shrinking portion of the overall population. 
</P>
<P>
 As the debate heightens over immigrants and their impact on California, 
old-timers in Moorpark provide a different spin on the issue. It is whites from 
the San Fernando Valley and other parts of Los Angeles who are flocking to this 
Ventura County city. And it is people with names such as Castro, Sepulveda, 
Lopez and Bravo who are lamenting how the newcomers have changed their 
hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican American gatherings of the past have all but vanished in a 
cultural shift that now reflects the complexion of Moorpark's new hillside 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 The city stopped funding a Cinco de Mayo fiesta last year. Now the only real 
citywide celebration, says lifelong Moorpark resident Ruben Castro, is a 
Western-themed parade complete with mock gunfights and line dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we have Moorpark Country Days," said the 65-year-old Castro. "They play a 
little country and Western music and sell hot dogs." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro and his contemporaries remember Moorpark as a small town where Latinos 
made up at least half the population, if not more. 
</P>
<P>
 When the city's statistics were first broken out in the 1980 census, they 
showed that Latinos accounted for about 45% of the population. Ten years later, 
the figure had dropped to about 20%. Planners say that percentage has fallen 
lower, and probably will continue its slide as more upper-middle-class families 
move to the upscale tract homes planned for the hills that surround the town. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cannot think of any other city in Southern California where this is 
happening," said Leo Estrada, a UCLA professor of urban planning. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada said the only other California cities he knows of with a dropping 
percentage of Latino residents are San Francisco, Redding and a small town in 
Sierra County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite interesting because it provides a flip side to what we're 
experiencing here in Los Angeles," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 What some of the locals in Moorpark lament most is the loss of the tightly 
knit and proud community they remember. Some worry that the influx of newcomers 
will erase their history from the town's memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark Historical Society President Connie Lawrason, whose husband is Mayor 
Paul Lawrason, said she does not know of any local tradition of Mexican 
American celebrations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've looked through all of the old photographs and haven't been able to find 
any of Mexican fiestas," said Lawrason, who has lived in Moorpark for 10 years. 
"I've asked a lot of the old-timers, and nobody seems to remember any of those 
festivals." 
</P>
<P>
 Castro shrugs off such suggestions. "Ask anyone that grew up here," he said. 
"They don't remember either because they weren't here or because they're 
white." 
</P>
<P>
 As a farm town before World War II, Moorpark was largely segregated. Latinos 
lived on the north side of the railroad tracks that cross the town and shopped 
mostly at their own businesses, such as Castro's father's store, La Mas Barata. 
</P>
<P>
 The town's Latino population had separate celebrations from Moorpark's whites, 
Castro said. He and his neighbors attended a segregated elementary school on 
Charles Street until fourth grade. When they went to the movies, they were 
allowed to sit only on the right side of the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, it was a racist place, but no different from the rest of California," 
said resident Henry Bravo, 68. 
</P>
<P>
 World War II broke down many barriers. On leave from the Army, Bravo remembers 
seeing Latinos protesting the segregated seating at the local theater. "They 
figured if we were good enough to get shot up in the war and die over there, we 
were good enough to sit anywhere we wanted to," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bravo, like other young Latino men, returned from the war in uniform and 
demanded equal treatment. He was the first Latino to move his family across the 
railroad tracks to a housing development called Sunshine Acres. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that area is mostly Latino. And Latino residents are concentrated in the 
city's older downtown area around High Street and along both sides of the 
railroad tracks. Many of the modest single-story homes have become run-down. 
Bravo says newly arrived Mexican immigrants crowd as many as four families into 
a home to save money. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighborhood's character contrasts sharply with that of the bigger tract 
homes in the hills. Some downtown houses have sloping porches and dirt yards 
with chickens strutting about inside a fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting under a carob tree he planted behind his well-kept home nearly 40 
years ago, Bravo reels off the Spanish surnames of the families from his youth. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's old-time Moorpark," he said. "Some of them are still around, but a lot 
of them are dead or gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark was a town of about 1,200 in the 1930s and '40s. It grew to about 
7,000 people by 1980. That is when things changed the most. The apricot, walnut 
and citrus groves gave way to housing developments. Since 1983, when it 
incorporated, the town has grown almost fourfold, to a population of about 
28,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't mind the growth," Bravo said. "What I mind is that they (the 
newcomers) seem to ignore us. Everything in this town is done for them. They 
forget we're still around." 
</P>
<P>
 A group of local women who call themselves the Guadalupanas formed about 10 
years ago to keep some of the local Mexican American traditions alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Martha Ruiz, 59, said the group's activities center on Holy Cross Catholic 
Church and on the annual feast day for Our Lady of Guadalupe, an apparition of 
the Virgin Mary seen in Mexico in 1531. But since a chapel was built outside of 
downtown, she said, participation has begun to falter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to keep it alive, and we still have special Masses," she said. "But 
doing something like Cinco de Mayo just takes so many permits and things." 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse Silos, another member of the Guadalupanas, said part of the 
responsibility for keeping the traditions alive falls on the younger generation 
of Latinos. Her father, a ranch hand, sponsored the local Mexican Independence 
Day celebration into the 1950s. She remembers fondly the traditional dancing, 
music and food that were part of the festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess the younger generation doesn't want to participate," she said. "It's 
all about remembering your history and where you come from. You have to want to 
celebrate that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Castro believes the responsibility is the whole community's. He admits 
that he has little contact with the "people in the hills," but wishes that they 
could work to bring the community together. He also wishes that the hillside 
dwellers would venture into town and embrace Moorpark's history. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't talk to each other," he said. "But our issues are the same. We want 
good schools, a secure neighborhood that's crime-free and an economy with good 
jobs. We worked hard to get that here, and we want them to remember that."

GROUP LISTS TRIAL LAWYERS' POLITICAL GIFTS; SPENDING: A SAN DIEGO ATTORNEY, HIS 
FIRM AND FAMILY HAVE GIVEN $800,000 SINCE 1990, LEADING THE STATE, ACCORDING TO 
A TORT REFORM ORGANIZATION.

<P>
 At a time when trial lawyers are proving to be perhaps the most generous 
political givers in the nation, one plaintiff's lawyer from California stands 
out: William Lerach of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an analysis of trial lawyers' campaign contributions released 
Tuesday by the American Tort Reform Assn., Lerach, his family and his law 
partners have contributed more than $800,000 to candidates running for office 
in California and at the federal level since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Lerach and his firm -- Milberg, Weiss, Bershad, Hynes & Lerach -- are among 
the nation's leading litigators of stockholders' class-action suits on a 
contingency fee basis against companies accused of securities fraud. The 
American Tort Reform Assn. wants to limit such suits. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the study, Lerach and his law partners have made contributions 
totaling at least $225,425 since 1990 to California candidates. As a result, 
his firm was judged by Tort Reform researchers to be the biggest political 
giver among plaintiffs' lawyers firms in California, and possibly the most 
generous such trial lawyers firm in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, Federal Election Commission records show that Lerach personally 
contributed $137,713 to federal candidates over the last four years; $250,000 
to the Democratic National Committee, and $7,500 to the Democratic 
Congressional Dinner Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, his wife, daughter and law partners made generous 
contributions to many of the same candidates, bringing the total to more than 
$800,000 on the state and federal level. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Tort Reform Assn. analyzed these contributions with the intention 
of demonstrating that trial lawyers have considerable political clout, their 
research also is consistent with previous independent computer-assisted studies 
conducted by The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, The Times disclosed that Lerach had contributed $74,000 to 
congressional candidates during the previous two years, violating a law that 
forbids anyone to contribute more than $25,000 to federal candidates during a 
two-year campaign cycle. He was subsequently fined $7,100 by the Federal 
Election Commission for his actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Lerach is out of the country and could not be reached for comment. He has said 
previously that his generosity is spawned by a general interest in public 
affairs, not by a desire to stave off tort reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, in an invitation to a fund-raising event that he hosted in 1991 
for a number of leading Senate Democrats, including Majority Leader George J. 
Mitchell (D-Me.), Lerach advised other trial lawyers on the guest list that 
"this event will give us an opportunity to support and express our views to 
some of the most influential members of the Senate who are in a position to 
protect the rights that we fight for on a daily basis and must preserve." 
</P>
<P>
 Although a number of campaign reform organizations have previously studied 
contributions to federal candidates by trial lawyers, the Tort Reform Assn. is 
the first group to look closely at giving by trial lawyers on the state level. 
The study focused on three states: California, Alabama and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 It found that trial lawyers in California contributed $3.4 million compared to 
$8.8 million in Texas and $5.1 million in Alabama. Judges in Texas and Alabama 
face voters more often than judges in California. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the big contributors to state candidates included: 
</P>
<P>
 Robert B. Steinberg and his firm, Rose, Klein & Marias, Los Angeles, $131,055; 
Joseph W. Cotchett, Cotchett, Illston & Petrie, Burlingame, $123,250; Bruce 
Broillet, Greene, Broillet, Taylor & Wheeler, Santa Monica, $82,250; Don Green, 
Green & Azevedo, Sacramento, $74,550; John A. and Thomas Girardi, Girardi & 
Geese, Los Angeles, $55,200; Vincent Bartolotta Jr., Thorsnes, Bartolotta, 
McGuire & Padilla, San Diego, $40,700; Phillip Borowsky, Cartwright, Slobodin, 
Bokelman, San Francisco, $40,050; Michael Scranton, Concord, $38,550; Ralph J. 
Jacobson, Gillin Jacobson & Ellis, Berkeley, $31,100; Richard J. Simons, 
Furtado, Jaspovice & Simons, Hayward, $30,500; Arnold Schwartz, Mazursky, 
Schwartz & Angelo, Los Angeles, $30,250; Michael N. Rucka, Rucka, O'Boyle, 
Lombardo & McKenna, Salinas, $29,495; Ronald Rouda, Rouda, Feder & Tietjen, San

BABY-SMUGGLING TRIAL UNDER WAY IN ROMANIA; EUROPE: BRITISH COUPLE WHO PAID 
BROKERS $6,000 SAY THEY DIDN'T KNOW THEY WERE BREAKING THE LAW. CASE IS LIKELY 
TO HAVE CHILLING EFFECT ON ILLEGAL ADOPTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A British couple accused of trying to smuggle a Romanian baby out of this 
country after paying $6,000 to shady brokers to obtain her insisted on the 
first day of their trial Wednesday that they didn't realize they were violating 
any law. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernadette and Adrian Mooney of Wokingham, England, are the first foreigners 
from among tens of thousands who have sought to adopt Romanian children to be 
charged with criminal conduct and threatened with jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 No verdict is expected in the case for at least two weeks as a lawyer for one 
of five Romanians being tried simultaneously with the Mooneys won an 
adjournment to call another witness on his client's behalf. 
</P>
<P>
 But the prosecution of the British couple is expected to have a chilling 
effect on the rash of illegal and questionable adoptions again plaguing Romania 
after a 1991 crackdown on the black market baby trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Madalina Buta, the senior of two judges who heard seven hours of testimony 
from the Mooneys and the Romanian defendants, read an indictment accusing the 
couple of willfully arranging an illegal adoption of 5-month-old Monica Baiaram 
in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment claims the Mooneys administered a sedative to the baby to quiet 
her for the car trip across a remote border crossing, hid the child under a 
blanket in a cardboard box, and then, when border authorities discovered her 
behind the car's front seat, attempted to pass off the infant as a previously 
adopted 3-year-old listed on Mrs. Mooney's passport. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mooneys' claims of being unaware of official regulations appeared to be 
undermined by their having legally adopted another Romanian child in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past three years, the number of abandoned children has dropped 
substantially in Romania, because birth control is now legal and available. 
Romanian adoption procedures also have been substantially restricted in an 
attempt to discourage illicit baby-trading, regulations that make the Mooneys 
ineligible for legal adoptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania has nevertheless retained an unseemly reputation as a country where 
children are easily available. 
</P>
<P>
 The overthrow of hard-line communism in Romania in December, 1989, revealed 
that at least 100,000 children had been abandoned to filthy and ill-supplied 
institutions by parents who had been forced to bear them by the tyrannical 
population policies of former dictator Nicolae Ceausescu. He wanted Romania to 
expand to 30 million inhabitants. 
</P>
<P>
 Altruistic rescues of sick and disabled infants from the appalling 
institutions quickly deteriorated into a flood of foreigners seeking Caucasian 
infants for uncomplicated adoptions. More than 10,000 children were handed over 
to foreign parents in 1990 alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Embarrassed by the worldwide image that Romanian children were for sale, the 
government imposed a moratorium on adoptions in 1991 and ordered a rewriting of 
legal procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 But amendments to the adoption laws have allowed courts at the local level to 
handle the cases, which has resulted in another rash of adoptions and allegedly 
inspired new networks of unauthorized middlemen who are paid to match 
cash-carrying foreigners with desperate parents and corrupt court officials. 
</P>
<P>
 While only 391 foreign adoptions were approved by local courts in all of 1993, 
the number through June of this year exceeds 850. 
</P>
<P>
 Western diplomats speculate that baby-smuggling and illegal payments to local 
authorities are also on the rise, although no reliable estimates are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Testimony in the Mooney case indicated that border authorities had been tipped 
off to the couple's activity, likely by a rival gang of baby brokers. Buta, the 
judge, said police had the couple under surveillance on July 5 -- the day they 
admit paying $6,000 to Ioan Batrana. 
</P>
<P>
 Batrana, who admitted to having arranged four previous adoptions, is charged 
with preparing fake adoption forms and bribing two other defendants to locate a 
baby whose natural parents would be amenable to selling the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Monica Baiaram, now 7 months old, has been transferred to a Bucharest 
orphanage pending completion of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanian legal experts speculated prior to Wednesday's start of testimony that 
the Mooneys are likely to draw a suspended sentence and expulsion, while the 
three Romanian middlemen are expected to be jailed. 
</P>
<P>
 The underage natural parents, both 17, are charged with endangering the child 
and stand to lose parental rights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The one good thing to come out of this tragedy is that of focusing on concern 
for children's welfare in Romania. Obviously, there's nothing wrong with 
adoption as long as it is done legally and with regulation," said Don McCready 
of the Romanian Orphanage Trust that assists with legal adoptions. "For too 
long people have come here thinking that they can take babies out of the 
country easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Although state homes still house tens of thousands of children abandoned 
during Ceausescu's tyrannical rule, most are above the age desired by 
prospective adoptive parents and many suffer disabilities stemming from botched 
abortion attempts and poor early childhood care.

 Clashes between troops and gunmen in Burundi's capital resumed for a second 
straight day Wednesday. Sources said five gunmen and two soldiers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said shooting with automatic weapons in the northern suburb of 
Kamenge, which broke out Monday night and continued until midnight Tuesday, 
resumed at dawn Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Military sources said gunmen attacked troops at Nyabiraba, 11 miles from 
Bujumbura, and five attackers were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 A Western diplomat said two soldiers died in firefights. The diplomat asked 
not to be identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Burundi has the same ethnic makeup as neighboring Rwanda, where more than half 
a million people, mostly minority Tutsis, have died since April in tribal 
massacres blamed largely on Hutus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rwanda blood bath was ignited by a rocket attack that killed the 
presidents of Rwanda and Burundi, both Hutus, as the plane carrying them flew 
into the Rwandan capital April 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethnic tensions in Burundi have been stoked by the arrival of 200,000 Rwandan 
refugees -- both Hutus and Tutsis -- fleeing the massacres or civil war.

AMERICAN ALBUM: UNIQUE GOLF COURSE REFLECTS THE MAN WHO BUILT IT; BILL MEADOWS 
CARVED OUT '19' HOLES, ONE FOR WARM-UP, IN VIRGINIA. THE 12TH IS THE LONGEST IN 
THE COUNTRY. 
</P>

 Bill (Farmer) Meadows has always had a fix on his own nature. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was 21, he played golf once and knew he would become obsessed. 
</P>
<P>
 But he wanted to accomplish some other things in life. So he didn't pick up 
another golf club for 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finally did, about three years ago, he went at it in his usual way, 
which is to say headlong. He hit hundreds of golf balls every day for a month 
before ever playing a round. A year after that, he decided he wasn't content 
playing other people's courses. He had to build his own. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be cheaper to play than most courses. The people would be friendlier. 
Every hole had to be unique. And, of course, it had to have the longest golf 
hole in America. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 at Meadows Farm Golf Course, carved out of the Virginia countryside 
near where James Madison lived, stretches 841 yards. Down a hill. Over a lake. 
Dogleg right. Up another hill. Over another lake. Paragraph mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Then past a sand trap shaped like a three-leaf clover. And up onto a green 
that is nearly half a football field long. 
</P>
<P>
 Par is six. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-nine more feet and the hole would have been half a mile long. 
</P>
<P>
 "How could I have been so stupid not to see that," says Farmer -- no one calls 
him Mr. Meadows. "I think I'm a pretty good promoter, but I screwed that up." 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. The course, which opened in April, 1993, already attracts 
golfers from distant reaches. They come, the curious and the devout, past 
mobile homes and down a dirt road, as if making pilgrimages to a religious 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 To its adherents, golf is a form of mysticism. Its best players talk about 
reading books on Zen. The best book on the subject, "Golf in the Kingdom," is a 
work of philosophy. In short, golf is as much an obsession with mental 
discipline as a sport. Which means it was tailor-made for Farmer. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the golf course he built, Farmer's life is a testament to the spirit of a 
man with the confidence and the means to make things the way he wants. 
</P>
<P>
 After coaching high school football for 10 years, Farmer turned a summer 
roadside fruit stand and nursery business into what claims to be the largest 
privately owned nursery company in the country. The revenues of his 21 Meadows 
Farms Nurseries last year, Farmer says, were $22 million. 
</P>
<P>
 When he took to building a golf course, Farmer wanted three things to be 
different. First, each hole had to be unique. "Most designers have this idea in 
their minds of the perfect golf hole. Then they go out and build it 18 times." 
</P>
<P>
 For ideas, Farmer bought $2,000 worth of glossy coffee table golf books, 
cutting out things he liked. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the five architects he interviewed refused to attach their name to the 
sort of freak real estate he proposed. But the fifth, designer Bill Ward, 
signed on. 
</P>
<P>
 The course has 19 holes, one for warm-up. 
</P>
<P>
 It has "church pew" bunkers, like the eight famous ones at Oakmont, Pa., that 
not only resemble long, narrow church pews but are about as easy to get out of. 
Farmer's course has 18 of them. 
</P>
<P>
 It has "bounce bunkers," sand traps with wooden planks in the middle so a ball 
will ricochet off -- in unpredictable directions. 
</P>
<P>
 It has an island green in the middle of a lake. 
</P>
<P>
 And it has a hole that resembles one of the most famous in golf: Augusta 
National's peninsula green held up by a rock wall lined by azaleas. Here Farmer 
himself built the 210-ton wall by hand, with uncut stones and no cement, using 
skills taught him by an Italian-trained bricklayer from his nurseries. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he had the design, Farmer wanted the price of a round to be cheap. 
Playing 18 holes on a good course today can cost $50 to $100. 
</P>
<P>
 His fee is $25, including the cart. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most places spend $1 million on the clubhouse and $300,000 paving the cart 
path," he says. Farmer's clubhouse is two mobile homes. The cart paths are 
gravel. 
</P>
<P>
 The third difference is everyone says "thank you" a lot. "People at most golf 
courses are on the brink of being rude." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is The Hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer wanted it to be the longest in the world. That distinction belongs to 
948 preposterous yards at Koolan Island in Australia, a hole that uses an 
airport runway for part of the fairway. You can play it only when no planes are 
landing. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there was the United States Golf Assn., which wouldn't sanction anything 
longer than par six. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacking the extra hundred yards and hoping some day for a pro tournament, 
Meadows had to settle, in this case for the American record. Yet as anyone who 
plays a round of golf with Farmer learns, having to play by the rules is not 
something he takes to. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 16th fairway, Farmer moves his ball forward off the cart path, a 
violation of the Rules of Golf. "I know you're not supposed to move the ball 
closer to the hole when you're fixing your lie," he explains. "But I'm not 
accustomed to moving backward."

U.S. DEMANDS N. KOREA'S NUCLEAR HISTORY; ASIA: WASHINGTON WANTS TO LEARN HOW 
MUCH PLUTONIUM MAY HAVE BEEN MADE. IT ALSO INSISTS THE NORTH GET A NEW REACTOR 
FROM THE SOUTH. PYONGYANG IS NOT COOPERATING.

<P>
 In an attempt to alleviate Japanese and South Korean uneasiness, Robert L. 
Gallucci, America's chief negotiator with North Korea, declared here Wednesday 
that the United States will insist that North Korea clarify the history of its 
nuclear development as part of any Washington-Pyongyang agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 He also offered an unqualified assurance that the United States will insist on 
North Korea accepting a South Korean light-water reactor as the only 
"politically, economically and technologically feasible" replacement for two 
gas graphite reactors that North Korea is building. 
</P>
<P>
 In its public statements, North Korea has so far rejected both demands. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallucci made the statements in separate news conferences at the U.S. Embassy 
and the Japan National Press Club. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, President Kim Young Sam of South Korea and Prime Minister Tomiichi 
Murayama of Japan agreed that the two nations will insist on a clarification of 
North Korea's past nuclear record as a prerequisite to cooperating with any 
agreement the United States might work out with North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of both nations have expressed fears that the United States might 
drop attempts to learn how much plutonium North Korea may have produced in the 
past -- suspicions range up to 22 pounds -- in favor of stopping future North 
Korean production of more than 350 pounds of plutonium a year through 
reprocessing of spent fuel from the two new reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallucci, however, declared that "the United States certainly would not 
cooperate in . . . the supply of any significant nuclear equipment" if North 
Korea does not make clear "what happened in the past" by submitting to special 
inspections, Gallucci said. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, he said, would be flexible about when, during the process 
of implementing an overall agreement, North Korea would allow the special 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 But "it is inconceivable that the United States, Japan or South Korea would 
tolerate an indefinite failure to resolve the historical question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallucci said the United States is also concerned about the continuing 
construction of the two reactors that "would produce hundreds of kilograms a 
year -- eventually thousands of kilograms over 10 years -- of plutonium. The 
strategic significance of these reactors . . . as components of a nuclear 
weapons program . . . is quite large." 
</P>
<P>
 The two reactors combined, he said, could enable North Korea to produce more 
than 160 kilograms, or more than 350 pounds, of plutonium annually. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambassador-at-large said he was aware that North Korea has sounded out 
"countries other than South Korea" about a light-water reactor as a substitute 
for the gas graphite reactors it has offered to scrap as a part of an overall 
agreement with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But "after quite a bit of work and consultations with other governments," the 
United States now believes, he said, that "the only technically, politically 
and financially viable model would be one in which South Korea played a central 
role, both in financing and construction." 
</P>
<P>
 Although other countries, such as Japan, would contribute to the $4-billion, 
2,000-megawatt light-water reactor, South Korea would provide a major share of 
what is expected to be an interest-free loan to North Korea to build the 
reactor, Gallucci said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean technicians would also take part in construction of the reactor, 
he said. So far, North Korea, which maintains one of the world's most closed 
societies, has refused to allow South Koreans to come into widespread contact 
with its citizens.

GREATER CONTROL PROPOSED OVER MEAT INSPECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration on Wednesday proposed legislation that would give 
the Agriculture Department more control over meat and poultry inspection and 
would require processors to test their products for harmful bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would for the first time require the USDA to find out at what 
levels contaminants, such as salmonella, in raw meat and poultry pose a public 
health threat, just as the government does now for pesticide residues on fruit 
and vegetables.Products that exceed specified levels could not be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also would give the USDA authority to recall adulterated products, 
establish a system to trace contaminated meat and poultry back to the farm and 
impose civil penalties on processors who violate the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan does not change the way USDA inspectors do their jobs. Currently, 
inspectors rely on sight, smell and touch to examine each carcass, even though 
the bacteria that make people sick cannot be detected that way. Later this 
fall, the department plans to announce an initiative that would give inspectors 
new responsibilities to ensure that plants identify and eliminate sources of 
contamination.

 Street violence erupted across Protestant areas of Northern Ireland, with 
gangs hijacking and burning cars, throwing firebombs and, in one case, shooting 
at police.Police and troops calmed the disturbances after a few hours. 
Protestant politicians warned police that further violence could erupt in 
Belfast if they do not change their tactics in hard-line loyalist 
neighborhoods. Tension between police and loyalist groups have been worsened by 
worries over a 2-week-old Irish Republican Army cease-fire.

 The leader of an international mission to monitor Yugoslavia's blockade of 
Bosnian Serbs headed for Belgrade in what may be the first step to easing U.N. 
sanctions on Yugoslavia. The U.N. sanctions were imposed in 1992 to punish 
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic for his earlier support for Bosnian Serbs. 
Milosevic stopped fuel and arms shipments to the Serbs last month when they 
rejected an international peace plan.

TURNING UP THE HEAT ON HAITI; BUSH SPOKE OF HAITI THREAT, CLINTON NOTES; 
SECURITY: GOP LEADERS HAVE CRITICIZED PRESIDENT. BUT HIS PREDECESSOR DID NOT 
RULE OUT USE OF FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton, stung by Republican contentions that Haiti poses no 
national security threat, said Wednesday that President George Bush repeatedly 
described the country's military dictatorship as a national security threat 
during the 1992 election campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, in a Sept. 30, 1992, message to Congress on "The National Emergency 
With Respect to Haiti," Bush went even further. He declared, "The assault on 
Haiti's democracy represented by the military's forced exile of President 
(Jean-Bertrand) Aristide continues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat 
to the national security, foreign policy and economy of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 White House sources said that Clinton, who cited Bush's comments in an 
interview with wire service reporters, probably will call attention to them in 
his speech to the nation at 6 p.m. PDT today seeking public support for the 
Administration's plan to invade Haiti if its military rulers fail to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show that the public overwhelmingly opposes an invasion, and Bush and 
many other Republicans, as well as some Democrats, have spoken out strongly 
against the Administration's invasion plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Bush, although saying he does not "want to be one more critic of our 
President," has several times taken issue with Clinton's threatened invasion. 
In an Aug. 15 speech to a National Hardware Assn. convention, Bush accused 
Clinton of vacillating on issues, including Haiti, and declared that an 
invasion would only "reawaken fears of gunboat diplomacy." 
</P>
<P>
 And on Aug. 31, when Clinton was turning up the pressure on the Haiti 
dictatorship with threats of an invasion, Bush told a banking conference in 
Buenos Aires: "We should not use force against Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 But when Bush was President, he did not rule out the eventual use of force to 
oust the military regime. In an Oct. 4, 1991, news conference, for example, he 
emphasized that the United States was committed to restoring democracy in Haiti 
and said, "Let's hope that can be done without any kind of force." 
</P>
<P>
 Another Republican critic of the invasion plan, Bush Secretary of State James 
A. Baker III, also hinted several times while he was in office that force might 
be used to oust the military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday at a political dinner in Houston, Baker called the prospect of 
an invasion "badly, badly misguided." Baker said Clinton had not answered three 
"simple but critical questions": What is the compelling national interest in 
Haiti? "How are we going to get out" after an invasion? And why would the 
United States invade now, three years after Aristide's ouster? 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton's own credibility is at stake after so many threats to 
invade, a senior official insisted, "Personal credibility is not involved. It 
is the credibility of the U.S. government and the United Nations."

ON THE HOME FRONT, THE BATTLE OVER HAITI RAGES; CONGRESS: CLINTON FACES BITTER, 
BIPARTISAN OPPOSITION FROM LAWMAKERS. BUT THE INVASION APPEARS INEVITABLE. 
</P>

<P>
 Opposition to a U.S. invasion of Haiti mounted steadily in Congress on 
Wednesday as the Senate opened debate on the U.S. military buildup aimed at 
forcing out the Haitian junta. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Democrats warned that if President Clinton heeds mounting GOP calls to 
seek congressional approval before using force, he is likely to lose in the 
House and Senate because of widespread opposition to his policies, even within 
his own party. 
</P>
<P>
 Scrambling to protect the President from an embarrassing foreign policy defeat 
during the final preparations for an invasion that now appears inevitable, 
Democratic leaders resorted to a series of procedural maneuvers to block 
Republicans from forcing a vote on a non-binding resolution opposing military 
intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was not in session, a similar crisis loomed in the House, where 
Democratic leaders were looking for ways to defuse a bipartisan effort to deny 
funds for the invasion of Haiti without congressional approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight in the House is expected to come to a head early next week, but 
distrust of the Administration appears to be running so high that some 
Democrats said privately they suspected that the timetable for an invasion is 
being driven in part by Clinton's concern about the growing congressional 
opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republicans had been clamoring for a vote on the resolution before 
Clinton addresses the nation on the Haitian crisis tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) succeeded in 
postponing the showdown until next week, Sen. John McCain (R-Ariz.) angrily 
charged that Mitchell's timing was suspect because most lawmakers now assume 
the invasion will be launched before then. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Democrats . . . are doing everything they can to block a vote because 
they know they would lose it," McCain said, adding that it is "unconscionable" 
that the Senate is being prevented from considering even a symbolic resolution 
on a matter involving "war and peace." 
</P>
<P>
 A vote now in the House and Senate would raise "formidable problems" for 
Clinton because he would "in all likelihood lose it," warned Rep. Lee H. 
Hamilton (D-Ind.), chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then you'd have a situation with the President charging off in one direction 
and the Congress in another, and what kind of signal would that send about 
American foreign policy around the world?" Hamilton asked at a breakfast 
meeting with reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as they maneuvered to spare him from legislative rebuke, Democratic 
leaders also urged Clinton in public and in private to hold off on an invasion 
and take more time to consult with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 There should be "no rush to invade Haiti. We're not threatened," House Deputy 
Whip Bill Richardson (D-N.M.) said. "It would behoove him to wait and to 
explain to the American people and the Congress why he wants to take this 
action." 
</P>
<P>
 That caution was echoed in the Senate debate by Sen. Sam Nunn (D-Ga.), the 
influential chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who said that 
Clinton needs to explain "more clearly what our stake is, what our interests 
are and what our goals are" before launching an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn said that, while an invasion would be "quick, decisive and overwhelming," 
the Administration's goal of restoring democracy would "clearly be a long and 
expensive process . . . costing hundreds of millions of dollars" and requiring 
a long-term U.S. presence, which the American people have not yet been prepared 
to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton said he has come to the "very reluctant" conclusion that intervention 
in Haiti is necessary because the crisis has reached the point where the 
"credibility, reliability and prestige of American foreign policy" are at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans, arguing that Clinton brought the crisis upon himself by 
mishandling Haiti, charged that it is only Clinton's credibility that is at 
stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they have a credibility problem, it is self-inflicted . . . and that's not 
worth risking American lives for," Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In its belated efforts to consult with congressional leaders over the last few 
days, the Administration has cited the Grenada and Panama interventions as 
models for the current crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 But the model most jittery lawmakers have in mind is Somalia, from which U.S. 
peacekeepers were finally withdrawn after suffering heavy casualties in a 
firefight with Somali guerrillas, a senior Democratic foreign policy aide 
noted.

O.C. CONGRESSMEN OPPOSE LANDING; HAITI: REPUBLICAN LEGISLATORS ARGUE THAT 
UNITED STATES HAS NO VITAL INTERESTS THAT WOULD WARRANT AN INVASION. THEY CALL 
DEPOSED PRESIDENT ARISTIDE A MARXIST THUG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Sentiment among Orange County lawmakers runs decidedly against the Clinton 
Administration's planned invasion of Haiti -- particularly one ordered without 
the permission of Congress -- with some of the congressmen moving to force 
hearings on the matter in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 The delegation of conservative Republicans has argued sternly all week that 
the United States has no vital national interests in Haiti and denounced 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, the deposed leader Clinton seeks to restore to power, 
as a Marxist thug. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) offered a resolution to require a 
debate and vote on any American military maneuvers, saying the rights of the 
House "are being threatened by the Administration's point-blank refusal to seek 
the authorization of Congress before launching its threatened invasion." 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. Constitution could hardly be clearer," Cox said Wednesday. "It 
grants to the Congress the right to declare war. Only in time of emergency or 
when the need for secrecy is paramount may the President make war without 
consulting Congress." 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of both parties find themselves in something of a role reversal from 
the days when a Republican occupied the White House and Democrats demanded 
congressional approval for military actions. Former President Bush invaded 
Panama and former President Reagan invaded Grenada without first consulting 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the Clinton Administration contends that the President, as 
commander in chief, has no obligation to obtain the blessings of Congress 
before moving soldiers into Haiti, and Orange County's congressional delegation 
is braced to do battle with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The basic question is, what compelling United States national interest is 
served by an invasion and occupation of Haiti? This question must be answered 
by the President to the satisfaction of the American people and this body," 
Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) told his House colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any answer by the President must also address the question of an exit 
strategy," Rep. Ron Packard (R-Oceanside) said. "It must be clear to the 
American people that this is not another fool's errand which will end only when 
we are forced out in some ignominious manner." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration contends an invasion is justified to stem the tide 
of immigrants from Haiti and stop human rights abuses rampant there since 
Aristide was ousted in a military coup Sept. 30, 1991. Since then, "unspeakable 
violations" have occurred, including the murder of clergy and the slaughter of 
orphans because Aristide expressed an interest in them, administration 
officials have said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orange County lawmakers denounced Aristide as a "Marxist demagogue" guilty 
of anti-American statements and worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would support a policy built around freedom and democracy," Cox said, "but 
not around this erratic Marxist." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), who has made illegal immigration 
his cause celebre , said it is not the dictatorship in Haiti but Clinton's 
economic embargo that is driving people there to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 "The policy of economic embargo has forced people into their boats because 
they are starving," Rohrabacher said in an interview Wednesday. He indicated, 
however, that he would keep an open mind about the wisdom of an invasion, if 
the President promised to make his case to Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe there is something I don't know," he said. "But . . . I doubt it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) took to the airwaves to 
denounce Clinton's plans while gathering signatures on a letter he wrote to 
House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Lee H. Hamilton and House Armed 
Services Chairman Ronald V. Dellums urging hearings on any use of American 
military force. 
</P>
<P>
 "Exactly what vital interests are at stake in Haiti? Why would we risk 
American lives to forcibly reinstall Jean-Bertrand Aristide as president of 
Haiti when his views are strongly anti-American?" Dornan wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County lawmakers also suggested Clinton was moving in Haiti less as 
a military strategy than a political one that might restore his sagging 
popularity before the November elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Those standing behind Clinton accuse critics of a similar charge, saying 
partisan politics are keeping Republicans from backing any move the President 
makes in Haiti, no matter how heinous the conditions there.

to announce his withdrawal from the U.S. Senate race in Virginia, a source 
close to the candidate said.Wilder had abruptly left the campaign trail and 
returned to Richmond. His aides said the campaign would have a statement today. 
In deciding to drop out, Wilder cited polls and his inability to raise the 
money necessary to compete against incumbent Democrat Charles S. Robb and 
Republican nominee Oliver L. North, the source said. Wilder's press secretary

NEWS ANALYSIS; BARRY DREW ON POLITICAL VALUE OF RACIAL ANGER; ELECTIONS: THE 
FORMER MAYOR PLAYED ON BLACK VS. WHITE RESENTMENTS. THE STRATEGY CAN PULL IN 
VOTES ON ALL ECONOMIC LEVELS, ANALYSTS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FULWOOD III, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As demonstrated in Tuesday's primary election victory here by former Mayor 
Marion Barry, candidates with large black constituencies are increasingly 
finding support from blacks of all socioeconomic levels by focusing racial 
anger at powerful white institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 While this political strategy is an obvious attempt to activate dispirited 
black voters, it also, quietly and less visibly, is a conduit for protest by 
middle-class black voters reluctant to express their sense of racial 
disenfranchisement, according to analysts familiar with issues that sway black 
voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black people are aggrieved in this country, and the lower down the 
socioeconomic-power levels you go, the more they feel put upon," said Roger 
Wilkins, a history professor at George Mason University. "But by tapping into 
that sense of injustice, someone can hit a deep political well that extends 
from the bottom up to the top of the black community." 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, that's exactly what Barry did as he collected 47% of the ballots 
cast in the Democratic primary for mayor of this city, handily defeating John 
Ray, a popular city councilman who received 37% of the vote, and one-term 
incumbent Sharon Pratt Kelly, selected by just 13% of voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Such high numbers for Barry could not have come only from new registrants or 
the poor people who were most visible among Barry's supporters. Clearly, many 
middle-class black voters pulled the lever for him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an "across-the-board, in-your-face" response by black voters in 
Washington to the federal powers on Capitol Hill who hold the city government's 
purse strings, said Mark Plotkin, a political analyst for WAMU, a Washington 
public radio station. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the privacy of the voting booth, in a mixture of mischief, defiance and, 
yes, even affection and admiration, they voted for someone that deep down they 
knew," Plotkin said of middle-class black voters. "I was surprised by the 
middle-class turnout for Barry. I never believed they would support him again. 
But they did." 
</P>
<P>
 Barry's political career appeared a shambles in 1990 when the FBI videotaped 
him puffing crack cocaine and urging a woman to have sex with him. But after 
serving time in jail and completing drug and alcohol rehabilitation, Barry won 
a City Council seat in one of Washington's poorest districts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers said he demonstrated that politicians can overcome 
transgressions if they find a way to portray their situation as a struggle 
against systematic persecution by powerful outsiders. 
</P>
<P>
 "People voted (for Barry) against the white power Establishment's attempting 
to dictate their lives," said Ronald Walters, who tracks black political trends 
as chairman of the political science department at Howard University. 
</P>
<P>
 After his victory, Barry, who is expected to win the general election handily 
in this overwhelmingly Democratic city, attempted to allay white fears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those white people, whatever hang-ups they have: Get over them," Barry said 
at a news conference Wednesday. "I'm the best person for Washington. I know 
best how to protect their investments, their businesses. I know best how to 
balance this budget. I know best how to save our city from financial collapse. 
I know best how to get us moving." 
</P>
<P>
 David Bositis, a senior political analyst at the Joint Center for Political 
and Economic Studies, a Washington-based think tank, said resistance to white 
authority fueled part of the Barry vote. But, he added, there was more to it 
than that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Blacks want what so many whites want: for government to represent them and 
the interests that motivate them to vote," Bositis said. "I think it's a safe 
thing to say that black voters -- whether poor, working-class or middle-class 
-- will turn out in cities to vote for the person they think best represents 
them. There is a lesson in that for all politicians." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Beatty, a senior editor at the Atlantic Monthly and author of "The Rascal 
King," a 1992 book on former Boston Mayor James Michael Curley, notes that 
white politicians have used similar strategies to create political machines and 
retain popularity even when they run afoul of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Beatty said that Curley -- like Barry -- had a long history of opposing 
entrenched "Yankee Protestants" and delivering patronage to his Irish 
constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 1949, the last year Curley was mayor of Boston, the city had the highest 
property tax of any big city in America and the highest number of municipal 
employees," Beatty said. "Just like Barry, Curley taxed people who had property 
so he could put people who didn't have property to work. In the process, both 
men created political juggernauts and both men delivered on their promises to 
their favored constituencies. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . Politicians use whatever methods they have at their disposal to 
motivate the largest number of people who are likely to vote for them. That 
would, of course, include racial and economic appeals."

 U.S. Coast Guard troops had seen only four Cuban refugees in the Florida 
Straits by midafternoon Wednesday, one day after the Cuban government began to 
crack down on departures by sea. A spokesman in Miami for the Coast Guard said 
144 Cubans were picked up amid high winds and waves on Tuesday, after the Cuban 
government, which reached an immigration accord with the United States, began 
to stop homemade rafts, inner tubes and flimsy boats from leaving the 
island.Cuban beaches were reported clear of the rafters. Despite the drop in 
rescues, the Coast Guard has no plans to recall the dozens of vessels that have 
been searching for refugees over the past month, the spokesman said. Coast 
Guard cutters and U.S. Navy ships have intercepted 37,046 Cuban refugees so far 
this year.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; RIVALS SEEK LATINO VOTE -- BROWN AIRS ADS, 
WILSON FORMS PANEL

 The candidates for governor launched campaigns Wednesday for the support of 
Latino voters -- Democrat Kathleen Brown began airing Spanish-language 
television commercials and Republican Gov. Pete Wilson announced the formation 
of Latinos for Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown aired two 30-second television commercials over seven Spanish-language 
stations in the major media markets of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Sacramento, 
Fresno and San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercials are similar to Brown's English-language ads that have already 
aired throughout California, with the announcer speaking in Spanish. New film 
was shot for one ad, in which Brown talks about the family dream of a better 
future for its children, to include Latino families, a Brown aide said. 
</P>

 The second ad deals with the California economy and says that Brown "will 
create 1 million jobs in commerce, industry and manufacturing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilson campaign announced that Orange County Supervisor Gaddi H. Vasquez 
had been selected as honorary chairman of Latinos for Wilson. Jonathan M. 
Sanchez, associate publisher of Eastern Group Publications in Los Angeles, will 
be chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles-area chairwoman is Sarah M. Flores, chief deputy to County 
Supervisor Mike Antonovich and a former candidate for county supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez commended Wilson for leadership in "confronting the difficult issue of 
illegal immigration and by working to force Congress and the Administration to 
reimburse California for the adverse impact of this failed immigration policy." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson campaign aide Dan Schnur said Wilson used Spanish-language commercials 
in his 1982 and 1988 U.S. Senate campaigns and his 1990 race for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 In a close race, the Latino vote could be pivotal. According to a Los Angeles 
Times exit poll, 7% of the voters in the 1992 general election identified 
themselves as Latino. The figure was 6% in the 1994 primary.

PATRICK O'NEAL; VERSATILE ACTOR, RESTAURATEUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Patrick O'Neal, the genial actor and restaurateur who established himself on 
Broadway as the defrocked cleric named Shannon in Tennessee Williams' classic 
"Night of the Iguana," has died. He was 66. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal, who also was a regular in the television series "Kaz" and a supporting 
actor in several films, died Friday at St. Vincent's Hospital in New York City. 
He died of respiratory failure after suffering from tuberculosis and cancer, 
said Cynthia O'Neal, his wife of 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1963, O'Neal and his brother, Michael, opened a restaurant called the 
Ginger Man near Manhattan's Lincoln Center. He started the restaurant, O'Neal 
said, to "take some of the insecurity out of show biz." Last year, the name was 
changed to O'Neal's. 
</P>
<P>
 For a few years, he co-owned another Ginger Man restaurant in Beverly Hills 
with actor Carroll O'Connor. That later became Carroll O'Connor's Place. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal chose the name for eateries on both coasts after playing the lead role 
of Sebastian Dangerfield in the 1963 off-Broadway play "The Ginger Man." 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, O'Neal also owned several other restaurants that flopped. He 
discussed his business failures with The Times in 1983: "Don't try to do people 
good. People don't want to be done good. When I stopped eating meat, I opened a 
seafood place. The world still wanted cheeseburgers. So the place failed. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I became a real vegetarian," he said, "I opened a vegetarian place (the 
StrEATcar) that also flopped. So my advice to any budding restaurateur is, 
'Give them carbohydrates and pecan pie. Don't try to be smart.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his varied career, O'Neal was equally unruffled about films that 
flopped. Asked about "The Kremlin Letter," which was panned by critics when it 
opened in 1970, O'Neal quipped: "I liked it better before the reviews." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal was born and brought up in Ocala, Fla., and educated at the University 
of Florida and Actors Studio in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his films were "In Harm's Way" and "King Rat" in 1965, "The Way We Were" 
in 1973 and "The Stepford Wives" in 1975. 
</P>
<P>
 He was eager to tackle any role, including many unsympathetic ones, and any 
stunt the script called for. He posed as a hard-riding cavalry officer in a 
Civil War Western, "Alvarez Kelly," even though he was not an expert horseman. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to go out to Griffith Park and get on a horse," he told The Times in 
1966, "I'd probably kill myself. But on that movie horse, I acted as though I 
really knew what I was doing. That's the trick -- act it." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1976, O'Neal portrayed George Washington for a Bicentennial short feature. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to "Kaz" from 1978 to 1979, he was a regular in the 1957 
television series "Dick and the Duchess" and the 1983 series "Emerald Point 
N.A.S." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neal directed training shorts for the Air Force during World War II and 
returned to directing, mostly stage productions, in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoy directing," he said in 1983. "It's what I call grown-up work, as 
distinct from acting, which is what children do. I liked playing daddy. And I 
liked creating the kind of atmosphere on the set that I rarely enjoy as an 
actor." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife and brother, O'Neal is survived by two sons, 
Maximilian of New York and Fitzjohn of Redondo Beach.

'STREAMLINING' SAVED U.S. $47 BILLION, CLINTON ASSERTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A year into the government reorganization effort, Americans are seeing the 
benefits, President Clinton said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, in a White House ceremony, praised the streamlining effort headed by 
Vice President Al Gore, saying it had saved the government $47 billion in its 
first year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said savings achieved through the program will pay for his crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 A status report Gore presented to the President said the savings were achieved 
primarily through the elimination of 71,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the report, the Administration pointed out what it said were achievements 
during the last year in slimming down the federal bureaucracy, simplifying 
purchasing and saving money. 
</P>
<P>
 Gore's National Performance Review last year made 384 recommendations it said 
would save the government $108 billion over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The President and Congress have enacted legislation to cut the deficit in 
half, eliminate wasteful programs and shrink the federal work force to its 
lowest level since John F. Kennedy was President," it says. "Across government, 
agencies and employees have found creative new ways to save money and operate 
more efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
 As of Sept. 1, Congress had enacted $47 billion of the projected savings, the 
report said, and an additional $16 billion in estimated savings were pending in 
congressional conference committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the saving was realized through a reduction in the federal payroll, 
obtained primarily through worker buyouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said Congress has also enacted more than 20 recommended pieces of 
legislation to save money and improve services. Clinton said the General 
Services Administration saved about $1.2 billion last year by reviewing 
construction projects and stopping the construction of government buildings 
that were not needed.

SENATE LIBERALS TO SEEK HEALTH INSURANCE FOR CHILDREN; CONGRESS: PREGNANT WOMEN 
WOULD BE INCLUDED IN PLAN. MEDICARE SAVINGS AND HIGHER CIGARETTE TAX WOULD PAY 
FOR COVERAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Faced with a devastating defeat on health care reform, die-hard Senate 
liberals are mounting a long-shot effort to provide coverage to America's 10 
million uninsured children in what may be the final battle in the contentious 
drive to overhaul the nation's medical insurance system. 
</P>
<P>
 As a "down payment" on future reforms, the group is urging Congress to adopt a 
proposal by Sen. Tom Harkin (D-Iowa) that relies on Medicare savings and a 
$1-a-pack cigarette tax to finance coverage of uninsured children as well as 
pregnant women, most of whom are said to be "working poor." 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of the ashes of the attempt to have a universal coverage bill," Harkin 
said Wednesday, "we can create universal coverage for the kids of this 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 But with less than a month remaining before Congress goes home for the 
off-year elections, even such a seemingly straightforward bill faces daunting 
if not insurmountable obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 With Republicans expected to make broad gains in November, few if any GOP 
senators now are willing to vote for any reforms -- and hand President Clinton 
something of a small victory on what was to be the centerpiece of his 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 The increasingly partisan nature of the debate was underscored Wednesday by 
the fact that at least 15 Republican members -- including those who have 
ardently championed children's causes in the past -- declined to join Senate 
Democrats in a Capitol Hill press conference called by children's advocacy 
groups to urge congressional action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hoping, we are praying that the needs of children will override the 
political divisions," said New York physician Irwin Redlener, long a children's 
health advocate. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the 1980s, many Republicans joined Democratic majorities to enact 
measures that, year after year, broadened Medicaid eligibility for children, 
according to Peters D. Willson, vice president for government relations of the 
National Assn. of Children's Hospitals and Related Institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The move to target coverage for children and pregnant women came as Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) continued his negotiations late 
Wednesday with a bipartisan group of about 20 senators calling themselves the 
"mainstream" coalition in hopes of hammering out a more ambitious reform 
package. 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting for more than an hour with four members of the "mainstream" 
group, Mitchell reported that "a great deal of progress" was being made, saying 
he plans to meet again with the group Monday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Harkin said Wednesday, expressing a widely held sentiment on Capitol 
Hill: "I don't see much that's going to come out of that." 
</P>
<P>
 Harkin and Redlener were joined at their press conference by Sens. John D. 
(Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), Tom Daschle (D-S.D.), Christopher J. Dodd 
(D-Conn.) and Harris Wofford (D-Pa.) and Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.). 
</P>
<P>
 At any given time, about 6 million pregnant women and 10 million children are 
uninsured, and nearly 70% of such children have at least one employed parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies have shown that each $1 spent on childhood immunization saves as much 
as $10 in potential spending for hospitalizations and other treatments. 
Similarly, every $1 spent on prenatal care saves more than $3 in costs 
associated with premature and low birth-weight infants. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkin said that his bill would be fleshed out by early next week. In its 
current draft, all children starting in 1996 would have access to affordable 
insurance. While children in destitute families now are covered through 
Medicaid, the uninsured children of "working poor" families would receive 
subsidies with which to buy private coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkin would provide full subsidies to families with incomes up to 200% of the 
poverty level. The subsidies would be phased out between 200% and 400% of 
poverty. The 1994 poverty level for a family of four is $14,800, so a family 
making up to $59,200 would be eligible for some subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
 His bill also would provide 100% deductibility for self-employed Americans, 
who now may deduct only up to 25% of the cost of health insurance. In addition, 
the bill would prohibit insurers from rejecting people with existing medical 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkin's bill comes with a price tag of $200 billion to $230 billion over 10 
years. In addition to the cigarette tax hike and Medicare savings, Harkin would 
triple the amount some Medicare beneficiaries would pay for Part B insurance, 
which pays for doctor's bills. The increases would affect individuals with more 
than $80,000 in yearly income and couples with more than $100,000.

DEAD STOWAWAY FOUND AFTER EMERGENCY LANDING 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Polynesian Airlines jet with 72 people aboard made an emergency landing when 
its right landing gear did not deploy.The body of a stowaway was later found in 
the wheel well, the airline said. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of death of the unidentified man was not known. Passengers used 
emergency slides to leave the jet after the landing Tuesday, and no one was 
injured, airline Chief Executive Richard Gates said. 
</P>
<P>
 The body in the wheel well prevented the landing gear from extending, Gates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stowaway apparently climbed into the right wheel bay of the Boeing 737-300 
while it was in neighboring Tonga, Gates said.

2 O.C. MEN INJURED IN U.K. FERRY ACCIDENT; COLLAPSE: SIX DIED WHEN STEEL 
WALKWAY TO CROSS-CHANNEL VESSEL TOPPLED. THE TWO FRIENDS FROM MISSION VIEJO ARE 
AMONG THE SEVEN OTHERS HURT.

 The last person Bob Welson figured would be calling long-distance Tuesday 
night was his son. 
</P>
<P>
 Darren Welson was supposed to be asleep several time zones away on a ferry -- 
with two friends -- crossing the English Channel to Belgium as part of a 
three-week European trip the three had planned. 
</P>
<P>
 But a steel walkway leading to the vessel collapsed in a freak accident, 
killing six people and injuring seven others, including Darren Welson and his 
best friend, Kevin Gaffney, both 24 and from Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got banged up a bit," Bob Welson said Wednesday of his son. "He hurt his 
knee and banged his head and elbow. He's pretty resilient." 
</P>
<P>
 Gaffney's father was also relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were at the end of the ramp, thank God," John Gaffney said. "It fell 
from the other side. I have a very lucky son." 
</P>
<P>
 The three friends' fall also may have been cushioned by backpacks and duffel 
bags they were carrying. The men had planned to sleep mostly in youth hostels 
during the trip, said Gaffney's mother, Charon . 
</P>
<P>
 "My son said he fell on his duffel bag," Welson said. "He fell from the 
walkway somewhat, but the angle of this thing was such that he didn't fall as 
far as others, and kind of slid down." 
</P>
<P>
 Welson said his son told him Wednesday that 15 people were on the walkway when 
it buckled. 
</P>
<P>
 The buddies were traveling with David Gillespie, 36, of Las Vegas, a friend of 
Gaffney's. Gillespie suffered a foot or ankle injury, according to Gaffney's 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 Others were not as fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Belgian men and a British man were among the dead, authorities said. The 
three others -- two men and a woman -- were crushed and could not be identified 
immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred in Ramsgate, a port city 60 miles east of London. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaffney was still in the hospital Wednesday with a dislocated shoulder, his 
mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 Charon Gaffney said her son underwent a test Wednesday at a Canterbury 
hospital to determine whether he had any internal injuries. She said a 
different test was to be conducted today . 
</P>
<P>
 She said her son was under sedation and unable to discuss the accident when 
she spoke with him Wednesday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 She was first able to talk to him earlier that day after five hours of fitful 
sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the distance," she said of the worry. "If it's New York, it's one thing, 
but it's across the ocean and it was difficult at first to get information." 
</P>
<P>
 During the day, the parents tuned to television, searching for videotape of 
the accident to try to understand what happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Welson, Gaffney and Gillespie were among the last to be boarding when the 
walkway buckled, said Welson's father. Most of the 400 passengers were already 
on the ferry. 
</P>
<P>
 Welson said his son was scheduled to return home tonight, and would likely 
have to return to England later for an inquiry into the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedish-built walkway was installed eight months ago, officials said. 
Investigators will focus on whether a structural fault or improper attachment 
of the walkway, custom-built for the ferry, caused the fatal collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 The three men met at an Amnesty International meeting, and had been planning 
the trip for the past year, Charon Gaffney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Welson works at Circuit City in Lakewood and graduated this summer from Cal 
State Long Beach with a bachelor's degree in chemical engineering. His father 
said the trip was a graduation present.

$50-MILLION CIVIC CENTER STRUCTURE FOR D.A. SOUGHT; GOVERNMENT: CURRENT 
BUILDING 'IS JUST BULGING,' CAPIZZI SAYS. SUPERVISORS ALSO WILL CONSIDER 
EXPANSION OF COURTS IN GROWING SOUTH COUNTY. 
</P>

<P>
 The Board of Supervisors will consider building a $50-million complex in Santa 
Ana for the district attorney's office and expanding court operations in south 
Orange County, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "This couldn't have come a better time," said Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi. 
"We're jammed into the space that we have at the courthouse. The building is 
just bulging." 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi said that office space has been so limited for his attorneys in the 
Santa Ana courthouse that they sometimes have problems interviewing witnesses 
and at times have assigned two attorneys to work in tiny offices made to 
accommodate only one person. 
</P>
<P>
 "Prisoners in jail are entitled to more space," Capizzi joked. He said he 
thought the new building would be "recognition that it's a project whose time 
has come. We will be able to work more effectively and efficiently." 
</P>
<P>
 At their board meeting Tuesday, the supervisors are expected to discuss 
expanding the South County courthouse and to select a developer for the 
district attorney's building project.  
</P>
<P>
 The developer would finance construction of a seven-story building that the 
county would lease for about $5.5 million a year for 30 years. At the end of 
the lease, the county would have the option of buying the building for $100. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the district attorney's office, the structure would house the 
grand jury administration, the victim-witness program and a cafeteria.  
</P>
<P>
 County officials said it would be built on the southeast corner of the Central 
Courthouse parking lot at Flower Street and Civic Center Drive. Lease payments 
would be made by a combination of general-fund money and district attorney 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they would also be able to redirect about $900,000 that 
currently goes to lease offices for the district attorney's consumer protection 
unit and child abuse unit and for the court's victim-witness office. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a new building, county officials estimate that by 2010 the county 
would have to spend about $2 million in leases to accommodate the district 
attorney's growing needs. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials will soon look into plans to renovate the Central Courthouse 
when the district attorney, grand jury and cafeteria vacate it.  
</P>
<P>
 Under another proposal to come before the board Tuesday, the supervisors will 
be asked to consider expanding the South Court operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the county had hoped to build a new court complex in South County 
that would replace the courthouse at Crown Valley in Laguna Niguel.  
</P>
<P>
 But when bids from developers were opened, it became clear that the project, 
with an annual price tag of about $10 million for the next 30 years, was more 
than the county could afford.  
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Schneider, the county administrative officer, said he is prepared to 
recommend spending $5 million annually to expand the court in South County. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the board will be asked to either scale back the scope of the new 
courthouse complex or consider expanding the existing site, which would cost 
about $5 million a year for 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Court operations in South County have nearly doubled in the last decade, but 
office space hasn't kept pace. Some operations are conducted in mobile 
trailers.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think both of these proposals are significant steps as they relate to 
addressing the criminal justice needs of Orange County," Supervisor Gaddi H. 
Vasquez said.

 With the setting sun Wednesday came the start of the most holy day of the 
Jewish religious calendar, a time for introspection and self-scrutiny for 
thousands of Jews in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbis throughout the county marked the start of Yom Kippur, the Day of 
Atonement, with services addressing such issues as spirituality and remembrance 
of the Holocaust, which ended in 1945 with the Allied victory over Nazi 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Yom Kippur, in which observant Jews fast, refrain from work and fill most 
hours with prayer, continues until sundown tonight. The high holy day -- 
culmination of a 10-day period of repentance that began with Rosh Hashanah, the 
Jewish New Year -- is a time of reconciliation with neighbors and God in which 
Jews ask God to inscribe them in his "Book of Life" for the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Torah itself calls this the Sabbath of Sabbath and marks it as a time of 
reconnection with God, of forgiveness by God," said Rabbi Elie Spitz, the 
spiritual leader of Congregation B'nai Israel in Tustin, which rented space at 
South Coast Community Church for more than 1,000 expected worshipers. "It's the 
time that we come together each year as a community to examine ourselves, to 
determine in which ways we might strive for wholeness and to reconcile with 
each other and with God." 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Spitz said he would focus on the Holocaust during services Wednesday 
night. His mother, a Holocaust survivor, was in the audience for services 
Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fifty years ago today she was in Auschwitz," he said. "The thrust of my 
remarks will be how to transcend the pain." 
</P>
<P>
 In perhaps the largest service in the county Wednesday night, Rabbi Mark S. 
Miller of Temple Bat Yahm also spoke about the Holocaust victims before an 
estimated 1,300 people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The true test of memory is to rededicate yourself to life, and we must 
remember not only their deaths, but the lives of the 6 million, not only how 
they fell, but what they stood for," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yom Kippur services traditionally draw more people than any other holy day in 
the year, and this year was not expected to be any different, with some 
congregations renting extra space. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 120 people were expected to celebrate the start of Yom Kippur in a 
hotel conference room rented by Chabad of Laguna. Rabbi Eli Goorevitch said he 
would focus on the central themes of Yom Kippur, including reminders that one 
must not "forget the individuals, the community, the importance of helping one 
and another." 
</P>
<P>
 The congregation also prayed for a prosperous new year, one they expect will 
include a new temple in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi Joel Landau of Beth Jacob Congregation Irvine emphasized the changes 
over the last 100 years in ways the Jewish world is perceived by the non-Jewish 
world, urging his congregation to commit themselves to Jewish education. 
</P>
<P>
 "They should learn, they should understand the legacy that has been bequeathed 
to them," said Landau. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbi David Eliezrie, leader of North County Chabad in Yorba Linda, planned to 
speak solely on the spiritual issues of Yom Kippur, what he described as the 
"the central concepts of repentance and our efforts for one day of the year to 
disconnect with the physical and bond with the spiritual." 
</P>
<P>
 During services, men and women traditionally wear white, symbolizing the 
spirituality of angels, he said. The end of the holy day will be marked by the 
blowing of the shofar, the traditional ram's horn that rings in joy and 
positive judgment. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we have to try on Yom Kippur is to reach into our souls with a sense of 
honesty and think for a moment of the things we need to improve, and make those 
decisions to become better people," he said. What the Holiday Means 
</P>
<P>
 * Yom Kippur is the holiest and most solemn day of the Jewish religious 
calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 * Started at sundown Wednesday and continues through tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 * Marks the end of a 10-day period of repentance, which began last week with 
Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Observant Jews fast, pray and refrain from work, seeking reconciliation with 
neighbors and God. 
</P>
<P>
 * Yom Kippur laws can be found in the Leviticus and Numbers books of the 
Bible.  
</P>
<P>
 * There are about 70,000 members of the Orange County Jewish community.

SURVEY SHOWS BACKING FOR AIRPORT; MEASURE A: BARE MAJORITY NOW SUPPORTS THE 
PLAN FOR EL TORO, BUT OPPONENTS DON'T SEE STRENGTH IN THE NUMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Support for an initiative that would require a commercial airport at El Toro 
has increased to a bare majority of voters, but backing for Measure A is still 
soft even among proponents, according a UCI Orange County Annual Survey 
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey showed that support for the November ballot measure, which seeks to 
convert El Toro Marine Corps Air Station into a civilian airport, has grown 12 
points to 51% in three months among registered voters, while 33% oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times Orange County Poll in May showed that only 39% of 600 voters polled 
supported the measure, while 58% opposed it. The UCI telephone survey contacted 
812 registered voters and was done between Aug. 19-29. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Katz, who co-directed both polls by Mark Baldassare and Associates, 
said the results of the latest survey do not necessarily foretell passage of 
the measure, called the Orange County/El Toro Economic Stimulus Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Support for the initiative is still soft. Even people who say they've made up 
their mind in support of it are still not strongly decided on the question," 
said Katz.  
</P>
<P>
 The UCI poll showed that voters are still not convinced that building a 
commercial airport once the base is closed in 1999 because of federal cutbacks 
will reap an economic boon for Orange County, as promised by sponsors of the 
measure. Only 36% of voters polled strongly agreed that an airport at El Toro 
will create jobs and improve the county's economy, while 21% disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 24% strongly agreed that "a commercial airport at El Toro is the most 
fiscally sound use of the Marine air base," while 31% said they disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't a lot of people who have strong opinions on the impact of a 
commercial airport at El Toro," said Baldassare. 
</P>
<P>
 But sponsors of the initiative have benefited from growing support in north 
and central Orange County. The Times Orange County Poll in May showed only 42% 
of the voters in those areas said they would vote for the measure. The 39% 
approval rating was for countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI poll showed that 57% of voters in north and central Orange County now 
say they would vote for the initiative. The countywide rate is 51%. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a significant number of undecided voters -- potentially the swing 
vote -- with 16% in the UCI poll, an increase over the 3% in The Times Orange 
County survey in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a slow start. We admit that. But I don't think that's a problem," 
said Garden Grove City Councilman Mark Leyes, a supporter of the initiative. ". 
. . We expect the support to continue growing in October, when people get their 
sample ballots and read the initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Katz said there really "isn't a groundswell of support" for the 
measure. She said the UCI poll's 3.5% margin for error means that "there really 
isn't much of a majority support yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll also showed that Orange County remains polarized on the issue. In 
South County, 55% of voters polled said they would vote against the measure, 
while 57% in north and central Orange County would vote in favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph, who is against the initiative, said 
opponents in South County have the edge because "they are firm in their 
resolution to vote against the measure." She said that opposition in North 
County to Measure A will grow "when they realize there are still too many 
unanswered questions about the cost of an airport" at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldassare said that the opponents' best tactic to defeat the measure is to 
"hammer away on the cost issue." 
</P>
<P>
 "Until people know how much this project is going to cost taxpayers, they can 
just as easily turn against it as they can turn for it," said Baldassare. 
"There's a lot of people whose opinions on the initiative are very fluid at 
this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the initiative need "to convince voters that the airport would 
create jobs and not cost taxpayers too much," Baldassare said. "At this point, 
both sides have yet to convince most voters of their claims." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Councilman Barry J. Hammond, who opposes the initiative, said the 
measure may turn out to be a blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really doesn't have a whole lot of support. If it fails, there won't be 
any more talking about an airport at El Toro," said Hammond. "From the 
beginning I've felt that even if we wanted an airport there, the best way to 
kill it is by putting the idea on the ballot. Exclusive of a few wealthy people 
who stand to profit from it, support for an airport is still very soft 
throughout the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Leyes said that airport supporters are encouraged by the results 
of the UCI poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's remarkable that we have 51% support throughout the county. But we still 
have a lot of work to do. We need to reinforce the belief that building an 
airport at El Toro will rebuild the economy in Orange County," Leyes said. 
Airport Measure Divides County 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure to designate El Toro for commercial aviation has scant 
majority support, but has divided the county geographically. Those in north and 
central Orange County more strongly support the airport while a majority of 
South County residents stand against it.At the heart of South County objections 
to a new airport are fears that it would create excessive noise and that the 
development would not be a fiscally sound decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure A on the Orange County ballot would designate the El Toro Marine 
Corps. Air Station for civil aviation and related purposes. If the election 
were held today, would you vote yes or no on Measure A? *

FANS' SYMPATHIES DIE ALONG WITH THE BASEBALL SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA and EDWARD J. BOYER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If you cancel it, they won't care. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the overwhelming reaction throughout the Los Angeles area Tuesday to 
the cancellation of the 1994 Major League Baseball season after team owners and 
players failed to reach accord to end the players' strike -- dooming the World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
 In coffeehouses and sporting goods stores, at gas stations and topless bars, 
male and female fans alike expressed disgust over the impasse, saying they 
would get along just fine without this year's Fall Classic, thank you. 
</P>
<P>
 There was little joy in Mudville or anywhere else Tuesday, just a lot of 
head-shaking and finger-pointing. In the eyes of many fans, Mighty Casey and 
his salary-minded friends truly have struck out this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 But the untimely death of America's Pastime for this season threw no curve to 
most baseball watchers. They sounded as though they have adjusted to the fact 
that October doesn't have to mean the silky play-by-play voice of Vin Scully. 
It doesn't have to mean draft beer, peanuts and that funky organ music, and the 
delicious tension of " . . . score tied in the bottom of the ninth, three men 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, couch potatoes and sports fans have still got the dash and crash of 
the National Football League. They've got basketball. They've got the National 
Hockey League (unless the hockey pros carry out their own strike threat). 
</P>
<P>
 "This is California, dude. We don't care about this stuff," scoffed Jay 
Eisenberg, the manager of the Footlocker store in the Sherman Oaks Galleria. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got friends in East Coast cities that are about to slit their wrists 
over this thing. But this is L.A. It's business as usual. We've got tons of 
other sports. We've got volleyball. We've got the beach!" 
</P>
<P>
 He seemed to speak for plenty of people who proudly proclaimed themselves 
ex-baseball fans Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Silly, silly, silly," said Morris Jacobs, 82, as he walked in the mall with 
his wife, Ethel. "They should have settled this thing without making people 
suffer. But heck, I stopped being a baseball fan in this town back in the glory 
days of Koufax and Drysdale. Now I play golf." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Kachina Grill in Downtown's Wells Fargo Center, the upwardly mobile 
from the gleaming towers in the surrounding financial district gather for 
cocktails and hors d'oeuvres at day's end. But the aborted season put a sour 
spin on Wednesday's happy hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got a bunch of 'haves' arguing with a bunch of 'have-too-muches,' " said 
bond trader Kevin Schoening, 37. "I'll miss the World Series, but I have no 
sympathy for either side." 
</P>
<P>
 But engineer Tim Hampton allowed as how he "probably would have tried to get 
tickets for the Dodgers in the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 For attorneys Milo Stevanovich and K. Todd Shollenbarger, the aborted season 
is a moot point since basketball has eclipsed baseball, in their view. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think basketball is the new sport of America," said Shollenbarger. "There's 
a lot going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Out at Elysian Park, on the approaches to Dodger Stadium, the Wells Fargo 
Center is but a soaring point on a skyline so near, and yet so far away. In 
Wednesday's lengthening shadows, Quintero Herson, 18, was hitting a baseball to 
several friends as dozens of soccer players practiced nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll miss baseball, of course," he said. "But if it returns next year, I'll 
still watch it on TV." 
</P>
<P>
 Devotion like that was not to be found at the Candy Cat lounge in Canoga Park. 
The afternoon regulars watched the topless dancers without the usual baseball 
game on the TV screen over the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never watch baseball, so I couldn't give a damn what they do with their 
sport," said Steve Jones, a 42-year-old construction worker. "They make too 
much money anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 All around him, nods of approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Over at the bar, Butch Cassidey and Pat Flynn weren't shedding any tears in 
their draft beers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What do you mean, we're not going to have a World Series? We've already had 
our World Series, as far as I'm concerned," said Flynn. "Those kids from the 
Northridge Little League played with more heart than any of those major 
leaguers ever could." 
</P>
<P>
 At the Sherman Oaks Galleria, 10-year-old Holden Burkons greeted the news with 
a quizzical look. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bad for them to just stop playing," Holden said. "I mean, lots of people 
like to watch baseball. What are they going to do now? Even in my Little 
League, we wouldn't do a thing like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Even older fans talked in terms of heroes. And disappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, these guys are my heroes. And I feel they've let me down by quitting," 
said Matthew Greenberg, a Footlocker employee. "They should just play ball. 
That's what they're paid to do. . . . You can't blame one side or the other. 
Both of them are greedy, if you ask me." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Southern Californians were glad to see baseball go. And not because of 
any anger about rising player salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I can reclaim my husband from the television set," said one shopper who 
declined to give her name. "If I heard one more gripe about him wishing 
baseball were on, I think I would scream." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ivana Lee is worried about her dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's obviously going to be bummed about the death of baseball," said the 
18-year-old Bakersfield resident, who was visiting the Galleria. "He's going to 
be grouchy. We'll probably be renting more movies now for him to take up his 
couch-potato time."

A NEW HOME FOR THE CITY'S HOMELESS; SKID ROW: BENEFITS OF UNION RESCUE 
MISSION'S MOVE INTO A SPACIOUS MODERN BUILDING WILL DEFUSE COMMUNITY WORRIES 
ABOUT DRAWBACKS, ITS PLANNERS SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY GORDON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For seven decades, the Union Rescue Mission has provided food, shelter and 
spiritual solace to untold thousands of homeless people at its headquarters 
near Main and 2nd streets in DowntownLos Angeles. In that time, the 
nondenominational Christian charity has seen its clientele change from a small 
corps of elderly men down on their luck to a much larger and more troubled army 
of younger men and women. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission has come to symbolize both civic pride in its good deeds and civic 
shame in the social woes it illustrates, particularly the sidewalk encampments 
of people who want to be close to free meals. Its location next to the region's 
Roman Catholic cathedral and a block from City Hall gave the Union Rescue 
Mission special prominence. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the city's oldest shelter for the homeless is moving from its cramped and 
run-down facility to a new $29-million building three times the size. While the 
shift is only seven blocks away to the epicenter of Skid Row, it has been 
prefaced by a decade of debate about how best to help street people and where 
their congregating should be encouraged -- or discouraged. 
</P>
<P>
 Its planners maintain that the new facility will offer so many humane benefits 
that the controversy over location will disappear. The five-story building 
comprises an eye-popping 235,000 square feet, dwarfing nearly all such shelters 
in the nation, experts said. It can hold up to 810 dormitory beds for 
transients and longer-term residents enrolled in substance abuse recovery 
programs. Its kitchen can serve 2,000 meals a day. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is almost the supermarket of missions. It really represents state of the 
art," said Robert Jacques, the project's design architect at the Nadel 
Partnership in West Los Angeles. "We had to design it in such a way that it 
brought life and hope to people who are hopeless basically. So it had to look 
like a flower, but be built like a tank." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren Currie, Union Rescue's president, said: "Our old facility was a 
one-lane road to help lead people out of Skid Row. Our new one is a three-lane 
major highway." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But some nearby businesses and social service providers are not anticipating 
the move so happily. They continue to question how physically concentrated 
shelters on Skid Row should be, how competing property interests in Downtown 
can be balanced and whether public monies should aid a religious institution. 
Less openly discussed is whether the drug-ridden sidewalk encampments will 
follow the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Those uncertainties linger even as workers are putting final touches on the 
L-shaped building, which has a contemporary, sculptural appearance and is 
painted cheery blue, green, brick-red and beige. It is located mid-block 
between 5th and 6th streets, with entrances on both San Pedro and San Julian 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a good-looking building and will be a positive contribution to 
the neighborhood," said Don Spivack, director of operations for the city's 
Community Redevelopment Agency. "Once they start operating, we'll see whether 
it works or not. As far as I can tell, it should." 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency provided $6.5 million in public funds for the move 
and is expected to purchase the mission's old property for at least an 
additional $1.5 million. A city plan calls for a plaza on that site next to St. 
Vibiana's Cathedral, along with housing and shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Remaining construction costs for the new mission come from donations and 
bequests, including $11 million from a family that requested anonymity, Currie 
said. The building is named after Louis W. Foster, the founder of 20th Century 
Insurance Co., and his wife, Gladyce. The Fosters and the company donated a 
total of $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of several ceremonies marking the move will be a parade Sunday of 
Union Rescue employees, supporters and clients from the old to the new 
facilities. A public open house tour is scheduled for noon Oct. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon afterward, Union Rescue guests, as missionaries call homeless clients, 
will no longer spend the night on plastic lawn chairs because of bed shortages. 
Women, an increasing presence on Skid Row, for the first time will have an 
emergency dormitory and space in the rehabilitation programs. Young and 
middle-aged men, who now outnumber elderly men among the homeless, will have a 
gymnasium with a full-length basketball court. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got no complaints about living here," said Robert Arzate, a heavily 
tattooed 47-year-old who recently moved onto a bunk bed in the old mission's 
crowded dormitory. "After being on the streets, anything is better. But I'm 
looking forward to the new place." Through the mission's prayer and work 
regimen, he is trying to kick the drug habit that landed him in state prison 
and then on Skid Row. 
</P>
<P>
 The new building's most dramatic feature is a 400-seat chapel focused on a 
towering cross-shaped window that leans over San Pedro Street. Other facilities 
include computer classrooms, a health clinic, a barber shop and beauty salon, 
rooftop recreation areas and a hotel-style kitchen with four walk-in freezers 
to store donated food. 
</P>
<P>
 The design also seeks to solve hygiene and security problems. It has 
easy-to-wash concrete floors, graffiti-resistant walls and surveillance booths 
in some dormitories and waiting rooms. The sexes are segregated in most 
circumstances. To eliminate hiding spots for drug use, many restrooms have no 
stall dividers. Dining room chairs are attached to tables to prevent use as 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 All that is a far cry from the converted warehouses and armories that house 
many of the nation's shelters today. It is also vastly different from Union 
Rescue's origins as a gospel food wagon begun in 1891 by Lyman Stewart, who was 
the president of Union Oil Co. The mission settled in its current location in 
1926. 
</P>
<P>
 The top two floors of the new building will not open right away because of 
funding shortfalls for furnishings and fixtures. Still, neighbors worry that 
free meals and the available 630 beds will attract too many people to an area 
already packed with facilities for the homeless. (Union Rescue allows people 
not enrolled in its rehabilitation programs to stay five days a month but does 
not restrict meals or showers.) 
</P>
<P>
 At 5th Street, just half a block away, is the Los Angeles Mission, another 
large and well-appointed Christian mission that opened two years ago. Across 
San Pedro at 6th Street is the Weingart Center, a high-rise complex of social 
and residential programs for the homeless. Newly built or renovated 
single-room-occupancy (SRO) hotels are adjacent on San Julian, as is a 
vest-pocket park where many homeless people pass the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Other charitable agencies share nearby streets with wholesale toy and fish 
businesses. Also battling for turf are crack cocaine bazaars and cardboard box 
camp-outs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The neighborhood is very apprehensive," said Andy Raubeson, executive 
director of SRO Housing Corp., which operates neighboring hotels for low-income 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others are most concerned about crowding and crime on San Julian, a 
narrow roadway where the mission will have its main entrance for the homeless 
who want a meal, shower or bed. Union Rescue staff and residents in long-term 
programs will be able to enter on San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 That dual entrance was designed under Community Redevelopment Authority 
pressure to appease San Pedro Street businesses that had fought the new 
mission's location there, records show. Then, to calm operators of hotels along 
San Julian, a landscaped courtyard and indoor recreation rooms were designed to 
draw people from the San Julian sidewalk and avoid big lineups. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission president Currie promised to work with other agencies to improve Skid 
Row safety and sanitation. The new courtyard, he said, will be "as attractive 
as possible so people will want to come in off the street and out of the sun." 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise has made neither side very happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just kind of an unknown at this point," said Tracey Lovejoy, spokeswoman 
for the Central City East Assn., which represents area businesses. The mission 
and the redevelopment agency "have made a lot of promises and we can only take 
them at their word." 
</P>
<P>
 Alice Callaghan, a leader of the Skid Row Housing Trust, which also owns 
hotels, is pleased to have the new mission in the neighborhood. Yet she 
considers the San Julian entrance "a nightmare" that could make the street too 
unruly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's amazing to me that the concerns of businesses to have as few poor people 
on San Pedro as possible was the highest priority," Callaghan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The irony of such debate, mission leaders note, is that they did not want to 
move at first. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a decade ago, city officials began to advocate a neighborhood 
make-over near the cathedral, including construction of a now-open state office 
building a block away. Although some mission officials suspected that the city 
wanted to push homeless people out of the Civic Center, redevelopment officials 
insisted that services would improve if the mission moved to Skid Row's center. 
</P>
<P>
 The redevelopment agency originally offered to acquire land through eminent 
domain and give it to the mission. That would have required Union Rescue to 
sign a pledge not to discriminate by religion in hiring staff. The mission 
balked, saying its independence could be violated. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After much haggling, the City Council in 1989 approved a $6.5-million 
relocation grant and allowed the mission itself to buy land. The controversial 
pledge was dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at Main Street, the city's Downtown Strategic Plan calls for the 
demolition of the old mission and the creation of "Plaza St. Vibiana," a 
pedestrian plaza and complex of low-rise housing and commercial structures 
south of the cathedral. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission's move can "really give St. Vibiana's another kind of presence in 
the Downtown as a great cultural institution itself," said USC architecture 
professor Robert Harris, an author of the strategic plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Father Terry Fleming, the archdiocese chancellor, said it was premature to say 
if the cathedral would participate in the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if encampments near the cathedral will fold once the old mission closes, 
Fleming replied: "I think that's a good assumption. The scenery doesn't draw 
them. It's not the beach or being close to City Hall." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, excitement is mounting among Union Rescue staffers and residents. 
"What makes this place special is that if a man really wants to get his life 
together, he can do it here," said Walter Boone, 56, who recently graduated 
from the mission's drug rehabilitation program. "The new building is very, very 
important and it will play a great role." A New Home After 68 years near the 
corner of Main and 2nd streets, the Union Rescue Mission is moving to a new 
building at the heart of Skid Row. At its new location, the shelter and 
rehabilitation center will be next to other facilities for the homeless, 
including the Los Angeles Mission and the Weingart Center. 1. St. Vibiana's

710 FREEWAY EXTENSION ROUTE GETS STATE OK; ROADS: KEY DECISION PUTS FATE OF 
CONTROVERSIAL 6.2-MILE LINK IN FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S HANDS. SOUTH PASADENA 
OFFICIALS SAY THEY WILL CONTINUE TO FIGHT THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Stalled more than 40 years, the Long Beach Freeway extension got a critical 
jump-start Wednesday when the California Transportation Commission gave final 
state approval to a route for the eight-lane highway through historic South 
Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's fate now rests largely with the Federal Highway Administration, 
which also must approve the 6.2-mile route through Los Angeles, South Pasadena 
and Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 The extension -- linking the San Bernardino and Foothill freeways -- has 
spawned heated controversy because it would split South Pasadena in half, 
threaten 987 homes along the route and destroy more than 6,000 trees. It would 
plow through five historic districts and threaten turn-of-the-century homes, 
including Queen Anne-style homes and Victorian farmhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials say they will try to move the historic homes and buildings to 
new sites or temporarily relocate them during construction. 
</P>
<P>
 For decades, tiny South Pasadena, with 3.5 square miles and 24,000 residents, 
has held off the extension with a barrage of legal and legislative challenges. 
On Wednesday, city officials promised more challenges -- and downplayed the 
significance of the commission's action, saying that major hurdles remain 
before construction can begin. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials and freeway proponents said South Pasadena's only real 
hope of staving off construction is a reprieve from the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming that funding comes through, state officials said, construction on the 
$670-million project could start as early as 2005 and finish by 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a major, major milestone," said Jerry B. Baxter, California 
Department of Transportation district director for the southern part of the 
state. "In my mind, the only thing that's holding this project back is funding. 
. . . (South Pasadena) has run out of options as far as the (state) goes." 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena officials, however, said they were not giving up. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's decades away from completion," said City Manager Kenneth Farfsing. "I 
think you're looking at 10 years of litigation after the federal (decision)." 
</P>
<P>
 Alhambra officials and other pro-freeway forces hailed Wednesday's decision, 
saying the extension will take about 100,000 cars off city streets each day, 
create 30,000 jobs and close the last major gap in the county's freeway system. 
The freeway starts in Long Beach and ends slightly north of the San Bernardino 
Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled to death with today's decision, having fought for this for more 
than three decades," said Alhambra Councilman Talmage V. Burke, a 42-year 
council veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 The last link of the Long Beach Freeway has been controversial since before 
the start of the freeway's construction in 1951, and there has been no 
construction on it since 1965 because of protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, the transportation commission has weighed and rejected dozens 
of alternative routes. Each lawsuit, environmental study and advisory committee 
report has prompted new debate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday's action gave the project unprecedented momentum -- the 
commission never before had approved the extension's environmental impact 
report, a crucial step in the state process. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Antonio Rossman, who represents South Pasadena, said the city will 
consider filing suit against the commission, challenging its approval on 
complex procedural grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote "may be of momentary political significance," Rossman said. "But what 
counts in the long run is whether the federal government will continue, as they 
have in the past 30 years, to disapprove what the commission proposes . . . and 
whether this commission and the federal government will put their money where 
their mouth is." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials probably will not decide the matter until next year, said 
Tony Kane, associate administrator of the Federal Highway Administration. The 
highway administration will not take action until studies on freeway 
alternatives and historic preservation efforts are complete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena is pushing a "low-build alternative" to the freeway extension 
-- a $110-million project of improvements to local streets, use of high-tech 
devices to speed traffic flow and the expansion of public transit. 
</P>
<P>
 The freeway furor has turned into a national cause celebre for 
environmentalists and preservationists. For five years, the National Trust for 
Historic Preservation had put South Pasadena, Pasadena and Los Angeles' El 
Sereno neighborhood on its "Most Endangered Historic Places" list. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, however, the areas were moved to a list of less-endangered, but still 
threatened places -- because trust officials believed the freeway extension 
faced a rocky future.

CHIEF GIVES PARKS 10 DAYS TO RESIGN OR ACCEPT DEMOTION; POLICE: WILLIAMS 
THREATENS PAY CUT, REDUCED PENSION. EMBATTLED ASSISTANT CHIEF MAY SUE, HIS 
LAWYER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM NEWTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams, in his first face-to-face meeting 
with the top aide he publicly demoted this week, gave Assistant Chief Bernard 
C. Parks an ultimatum Wednesday: Retire within 10 days or accept a demotion, a 
pay cut and a reduced pension. 
</P>
<P>
 The blunt offer came during a brief morning meeting between the LAPD's two 
highest-ranking and most prominent officials. The showdown ended abruptly when 
Parks left after about 20 minutes, police officials said, adding that they were 
told the two men exchanged some harsh words and that Williams formally served 
Parks with his demotion papers. 
</P>
<P>
 Skip Miller, a lawyer representing Parks, said his client was studying 
Williams' ultimatum but was continuing to weigh other options as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Those could include filing suit to save his job or seeking an injunction to 
block the demotion, Miller said. "He's considering all his options," Miller 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another of Parks' attorneys, Barry Levin, said Williams made a number of 
errors in handling the demotion, including failing to give the assistant chief 
adequate notice of the pending action. But Gary Greenebaum, a member of the 
Police Commission, said he believed the proper procedures had been followed. 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting the demotion could cost Parks about $15,000 a year in lost salary 
and more than $500 a month in pension payments for the rest of his life. Police 
pensions are based on an officer's last salary, so Parks would lose the money 
unless he stayed with the department and eventually regained a position as an 
assistant chief. 
</P>
<P>
 As Parks weighed his options, Williams began the process of symbolically 
removing his assistant chief from his seat of power. On Wednesday morning, even 
as Williams and Parks were meeting, a police officer began packing up the 
personal belongings in Parks' office. 
</P>
<P>
 At Parker Center, many officials, including some loyal to Parks, said they had 
all but concluded that the assistant chief will not keep his post. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's over," said one. "Bernie's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 The blowup this week between the LAPD's two top officials comes after months 
of a steadily deteriorating relationship between the two men, who had competed 
against each other for the department's top job in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 According to City Hall sources, Parks has made no secret of his concerns about 
Williams' leadership -- telling council members, for instance, that Williams 
has failed to act on such items as a report detailing allegations of sexual 
harassment at the West Los Angeles police station. 
</P>
<P>
 On another occasion, Parks told council members in response to their questions 
that he expected the LAPD to take a strong stand against imposing a strict 
hiring goal for female officers and against changing training standards that 
some women's advocates objected to. 
</P>
<P>
 When Williams appeared before the council, he declined to stake a firm 
position on those issues, saying he would defer to the wishes of council 
members. Several council members commented later on the difference in tone 
between Williams' comments and those from Parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parks is no stranger to letting people know about Williams' weaknesses," one 
City Hall source said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of Parks' remarks have made their way back to Williams, who saw them as 
disloyal and believed his second-in-command was actively undermining his 
credibility. Parks has told colleagues that he believed he was providing 
council members with honest assessments of the Police Department, but Williams 
perceived the comments differently, interpreting them as conveying Parks' 
contempt for his boss. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, Williams told a few key city officials that he planned to demote 
Parks, but pulled back when he realized the extent of his aide's political 
support. Members of the council and the Police Commission warned Williams that 
Parks was held in high esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 The two then spoke about their differences, and Police Department officials 
believed they were working together again. In a recent interview with The 
Times, Williams said he had no complaints with Parks and no plans to 
restructure his top staff. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Williams came under increasing pressure from Mayor Richard Riordan 
and leaders of the Police Commission demanding better management of the 
department, he stiffened his resolve to make changes in his leadership team, 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to demoting Parks, Williams proposed to elevate Deputy Chief 
Ronald Banks to a newly created post of first assistant chief. If approved by 
the Police Commission and City Council, Banks would take control of all Police 
Department operations and would report only to Williams, an organizational 
setup common among many East Coast police departments but an unusual departure 
for the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 That proposal has met with some early doubts among City Council members, and 
Williams' handling of the shake-up this week has raised new questions about his 
management skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the Parks affair, Williams has been largely impervious to criticism 
around City Hall. The chief was credited with restoring a sense of order and 
respect for the Police Department and presenting a cool, rational face to the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times Poll this summer found that 73% of the residents approved of the job 
he was doing, even better than popular Mayor Richard Riordan, who had a 59% 
approval rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the council continues to back Williams, saying he should be given the 
freedom to run the department. But for the first time since his arrival from 
Philadelphia two years ago, some council members have signaled that they are 
ready to confront Williams on more than just the demotion of Parks. Several 
said they will begin pushing harder for progress in hiring more officers, 
putting more police on the streets and upping the percentages of minorities and 
women in uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had his honeymoon," said Eastside Councilman Richard Alatorre. "It's 
about time we really look at him. What has he done in two years?" 
</P>
<P>
 Council President John Ferraro said: "I don't know if (Williams) has been that 
involved in the operation of the department. He has gone around and met a lot 
of the public and done that well. But I think he has done enough of that for 
now."

DETECTIVES HEAR 911 PLEA, SAVE CHOKING BABY; WOODLAND HILLS: INFANT HAD STOPPED 
BREATHING WHILE BEING BREAST FED. MOTHER CALLS RESCUE A 'MIRACLE.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It could have been a scene out of the television show "Rescue 911." 
</P>
<P>
 New mother Angela Goodman had just finished breast feeding her 12-day-old 
baby, when she noticed that he had stopped breathing and was turning red. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started losing it," Goodman, 29, said Wednesday after the incident unfolded 
in her Woodland Hills living room just before 1 p.m. "I kept saying to myself, 
'Stay calm,' but I totally lost it." 
</P>
<P>
 A hysterical Goodman called her pediatrician. When she was put on hold, she 
hung up and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 An ambulance was dispatched, but two West Valley detectives on their way back 
from lunch overheard the call on their radio. Realizing they were nearby, they 
reached the house in the 20400 block of Califa Street in less than a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 When Detective Tony Fichen and his partner, Detective Bob Hart, arrived, 
seven-pound Zachary was red in the face. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was the first one in the house and the mom had the baby on (his) back," 
said Fichen. "I took the baby and squeezed the stomach, kept (his) head back to 
keep the airway cleared and squeezed again." 
</P>
<P>
 Zachary caught his breath, and jubilation filled the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a miracle," Goodman said as she held Zachary, clad only in diapers, 
close to her. "He came in here like a messenger of God and took over. It was 
wonderful. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is not enough praise I can give the officers," Goodman said. "(Fichen) 
was as gentle as a lamb when he was handling the baby. He saved his life, and I 
am just so grateful." 
</P>
<P>
 Fichen said saving the baby was relatively easy after he squeezed mucous out 
of the baby's mouth, though the incident hit a nerve with the detective, who 
went on a similar call seven years ago as a Foothill Division patrolman. 
</P>
<P>
 "A long time ago, I lost a baby on the job," said the 13-year LAPD veteran. 
"As soon as I heard the radio call, it all rushed back into my head. 
</P>
<P>
 "It made me feel real good, though," he said. "Every day we usually deal with 
such depressing stuff. It is great to be able to really help someone." 
</P>
<P>
 After the incident, Goodman and her husband Ken, 31, took Zachary to Tarzana 
Medical Center to be examined. Doctors told them Zachary was fine, and that the 
incident may have been caused by a spasm in the baby's throat, which was 
agitated by the mixture of phlegm and breast milk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever it was, I am never putting Zachary down," Goodman said, "and thank 
God for 911."

STUDENTS DENOUNCE EOP MOVES AT CSUN; PROTEST: IN LATEST FLARE-UP OF ETHNIC 
TENSION, LATINOS MARCH AND PICKET AGAINST THE REORGANIZATION OF PROGRAM THAT 
SERVES MINORITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER and ANTONIO OLIVO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the latest episode of ethnic unrest at Cal State Northridge, more than 100 
Latinos marched through campus and picketed the president's office Wednesday to 
protest the reorganization of a 25-year-old program that serves disadvantaged 
minority students. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of broader changes in student services, CSUN President Blenda J. 
Wilson last spring reassigned the staff of the campus' centralized Educational 
Opportunity Program into a handful of other non-EOP offices where they, 
administrators say, will continue to serve the same disadvantaged students. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus administrators maintain the change will actually improve the level of 
services to the campus' nearly 3,500 EOP students, about two thirds of whom are 
Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 But protesting students, faculty and staff members claimed the change has 
dismantled the program and instead lessened key services. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks ago, a crowd of black students marched on campus to protest the 
hiring of a white part-time instructor who is now the only non-black faculty 
member in CSUN's Pan-African studies department. Those protesters demanded that 
Wilson, who is black, remove the teacher, but she refused. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the EOP program, mandated by a 1969 state law, low-income and mostly 
minority students who may not meet the Cal State system's normal academic 
admissions requirements are admitted and given special support services such as 
tutoring, counseling and financial aid grants. 
</P>
<P>
 "For most of us, EOP has been the link between the family environment and our 
transition into college," said Juana Mora, chair of CSUN's Chicano studies 
department. "Many of us would not be here if it weren't for this program," she 
told the crowd at a rally prior to the march. 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Richard Alarcon, an EOP alumni at CSUN and the first Latino in 
modern times to represent the Valley on the Los Angeles City Council, read a 
statement in which he said he was "appalled" by the changes and recalled 
fighting EOP cutbacks as a student 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Protesters demanded that the now-vacant position of EOP director be filled and 
that the program be returned to its former unified status. They also demanded a 
halt to what they claim has been the use of some of CSUN's $1.6-million EOP 
budget for other purposes.  
</P>
<P>
 CSUN Provost Louanne Kennedy, in an interview, rejected the protesters' 
demands for immediate action and denied any diversion of funds. A campus task 
force will be formed to study the issues of the director and unification, and 
report back next spring, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 20 campuses of the Cal State system still serve EOP students 
through a centralized office and staff. But now that CSUN's EOP central unit 
has been dismantled, protesters said students no longer get the same special 
attention and are confused about where to go on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Some charged the university dismantled the program to make the suburban campus 
-- which now has a more than 50% total minority enrollment and a more than 70% 
minority freshman class -- less hospitable to minority students. University 
officials denied the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said the reallocation of EOP staff, said to be about 40 people, was 
aimed at making the entire campus community, not just the EOP office, 
responsible for supporting minority students. She also said that the old system 
was not effective enough in keeping and graduating minority students. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the dramatic growth in CSUN's minority population, Kennedy said, "We 
really needed to refocus the entire university to dealing with students at 
risk. It seemed inappropriate to continue to have a separate unit dealing with 
a majority of minorities."

ON THE FRONT LINES, NEW CRIME LAW BUILDS LOW EXPECTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Much ado about nothing is the way some of those who know most about San 
Fernando Valley crime viewed the new federal crime law, a day after its 
signing. A defense attorney said the law's addition of 50 crimes to the list of 
death penalty cases is silly. A deputy district attorney said its stricter gun 
controls will have little effect, especially in a state with already stringent 
firearms restrictions. A police commander said its additional police officers 
will have less impact than more crime-fighting equipment. But most of those 
interviewed welcomed the $13.5 billion the law includes for training and hiring 
new officers nationwide and applauded the $7 billion for crime-prevention 
efforts such as midnight basketball programs. The thoughts of four people with 
widely varied perspectives, all of whom agreed about just one thing: The law is 
probably more effective as a political weapon among opponents than as a 
crime-fighting tool for those in the trenches. As told to Times staff writer 
Chip Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Bob Gale, area commander at the LAPD's Foothill Division, supports the 
idea of pairing funds for meaningful social programs with the plan to beef up 
local police agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know if I have a lot of optimism as far as putting cops on the street 
because, if this is a one-time payment, we can train officers, but how do we 
pay for them year after year? 
</P>
<P>
 What I'd like to see is more much-needed equipment, black and whites (patrol 
cars), modern radios to replace our antiquated system. We need to computerize 
all our stations and upgrade our crime-analysis tools, and put more effort 
toward problem solving and community policing. If we had the funds to do that, 
we could accomplish a lot more. 
</P>
<P>
 L. A. is so under-policed we need to make the resources we have here -- the 
cops -- a little better-equipped.

<P>
 I just bought four computers from money donated by our community sponsors -- a 
$4,500 computer and three word processors for report writing. These are 
luxuries that the city cannot afford. But we can't afford not to have it. 
</P>
<P>
 Until we know hard numbers, it will be hard to predict how this will help, but 
any help the federal, state or local government is willing to give us, I'm 
happy to receive it. 
</P>
<P>
 We do need to have programs that people from impoverished areas and areas of 
high unemployment can go to to learn trades and get jobs and lead them away 
from lives of crime. It would be irresponsible to build more prisons. 
</P>
<P>
 It's frustrating to arrest the same people day in and day out and have the 
city attorney's or district attorney's office not file cases based on a dollar 
amount or how minor the injuries were. 
</P>
<P>
 We encounter a lot of people who are just opportunists, and maybe if they had 
a decent job and could provide for their families they wouldn't be engaged in 
crime.

 LeRoy Chase, executive director of the Pacoima Boys & Girls Club of the San 
Fernando Valley, welcomes the chance to compete for additional federal 
crime-prevention funds. 
</P>
<P>
 We have numerous nonprofit organizations around the city that have to juggle 
their finances. I hope the crime bill gets money to social service agencies. I 
can think back to the '60s and '70s, when we did have more money. It did have 
an impact. 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a drop from the opportunities provided young people under 
community grants in the 1970s and what is provided today. We were able to 
provide more opportunities in recreation, and I think that it's important that 
we address a young person's leisure time, and I hope the bill provides money so 
we can provide positive opportunities and outings for young people. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that Democrats, Republicans and independents are going to have to get 
together and realize that we have some problems, and we need some dollars to 
work with. We've had tremendous burdens placed on nonprofit organizations, and 
the doors we knock on today, well, we find very little money there. 
</P>
<P>
 It's disheartening when you see the amount of money that's leaving this 
country while we go without. And that's also a hard thing to explain to a young 
person who has no opportunities. It's damned difficult. I'm not saying foreign 
aid isn't important, but you have to take care of home first. It's becoming a 
nightmare because the resources are dwindling at the same time that costs are 
increasing. 
</P>
<P>
 We currently have an alumni program -- young people over the age of 18 or 19. 
I have one young man who is in his 30s. The closest thing to the midnight 
basketball league in the East Valley would be our program, which used to run 
until 10 p.m. But we had to cut that back (to 8 p.m.) because of finances and 
safety concerns. Everything has a dollar sign above it these days.

 Steve Cooley, head of the Los Angeles district attorney's Van Nuys office, 
believes putting more police officers on the street is the only aspect of the 
law that will count for Los Angeles residents. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know that this will appease anyone other than those who advocate 
stricter gun controls, but that will not necessarily have an impact on local 
crime. There is certainly a crime-prevention aspect that will result in 
billions of dollars being committed to some worthy programs, but to 
characterize some aspects of it as a crime bill is a mischaracterization. 
</P>
<P>
 What you have here is a crime bill with many aspects that are not consistent 
with each other or law enforcement-related. 
</P>
<P>
 It will have little or no impact on local law enforcement or courts. 
</P>
<P>
 In my branch (of the district attorney's office) in San Fernando, which is one 
of 11 branches, we file 300 felony cases a month. That's our average. The 
volume is at the county level. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they have 50 new statutory provisions that will allow for seeking 
the death penalty, I believe that the actual number of new death cases we 
handle will be minuscule compared with the number prosecuted by county 
prosecutors in state court. It's the nature of the jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 There is obviously seed money for the hiring and training of police officers. 
That is important. My understanding is that will be paid for ultimately by 
local taxpayers, and that's fine with me. That's the only true meaningful 
aspect of this crime bill, and even then it has to be put in the local 
perspective of city taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the only thing aimed at controlling crime. The feds spent a lot of 
money over the years on programs that have not done much that we can see or 
measure. It's speculative. It's just another social program. 
</P>

 Harland Braun, 51, a defense attorney located in Century City who recently 
represented former Los Angeles Police Officer Ted Briseno against charges of 
beating Rodney G. King in Lake View Terrace. Braun thinks locking up more 
people is barbaric. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the thing is so silly. Like the 'three strikes' bill is not going to 
do anything in Los Angeles. Fifty more death penalty (crimes) is a joke. It's 
just politics from the left and the right. Any politician knows it's a fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The only part that will have any effect is hiring 100,000 more officers. The 
certainty of being caught committing a crime is what deters crime, and that's 
why 100,000 extra policemen will help. A crook doesn't usually make huge 
calculations about what is the latest punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ninety percent of the people we're locking up right now, all we're doing is 
destroying the rest of the government by spending $30,000 a year to keep them 
in jail. A person who bounces checks and has two prior burglaries 20 years ago, 
he's going to do 75 years. I would rather spend it sending someone to the 
university. Send him away for a year. It's like the red scare, it's like the 
fear of communism, witch hunts. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a genuine danger, and we are in greater danger than 15 years ago, but 
the answers are complicated and they don't make for 10-second sound bites. If a 
politician comes up and says, "There may be a generation of kids to write off, 
but we may be able to save the next one, long after I'm out of office," there's 
no gain in that. 
</P>
<P>
 In five to 10 years there will be a meltdown in the criminal justice system, 
and then we will all sit down and re-evaluate it, rationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The way you inspire is by being rational, fair, and just. This law is 
irrational, unfair and unjust. It's like a parent that under-punishes one 
child, over-punishes another and lies.

COUNTY PLANS VACCINATION DATABASE; HEALTH: OFFICIALS HOPE TO HAVE A COMPUTER 
TRACK CHILDHOOD IMMUNIZATIONS BY NEXT YEAR, BUT MUCH RESTS ON A PIECE OF STATE 
LEGISLATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. WEISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To protect infants and toddlers from potentially deadly diseases, Ventura 
County health officials are assembling a computerized tracking program to keep 
tabs on immunization shots for all preschool children in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The new computer registry will tentatively start next year by tracking 
vaccinations given to children at county health centers in Ventura, Oxnard and 
Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes as planned, health officials will then expand the program to all 
children, logging their birth records into the computer system and then 
automatically sending their parents reminder notices of needed shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials believe the computerized registry can boost local 
immunization levels to about 90% and thus guard against lethal outbreaks of 
measles, hepatitis or whooping cough that have surfaced in other parts of the 
nation. About 61% of children in the county are fully immunized at age 2. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been fortunate that we have not had an epidemic sweep through the 
county," said Dr. Gary M. Feldman, the county's health officer. "But we are 
getting to dangerously low levels of immunization and we will get hit if we 
don't do something about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's plans, however, rely largely on Gov. Pete Wilson signing a bill 
on his desk that would exempt childhood immunization records from privacy 
protections covering medical records. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Wednesday, Wilson had not signed the bill passed last month by the state 
Legislature. Although the measure has wide support from public health 
officials, Assemblyman David Knowles (R-Cameron Park) is urging Wilson to veto 
the bill, saying it would merely lead to more government intrusion into private 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is just another Big Brother databank that we don't need," said Lance 
Hastings, an aide to Knowles. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman said he is confident that the law will change by 1997, when the county 
is ready to make its computerized registry available to every pediatrician and 
health care clinic in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the county Health Care Agency is focused on buying a computer and 
developing the software that could ultimately link the county's immunization 
registry to similar programs in a half-dozen other counties or possibly a 
statewide immunization databank. 
</P>
<P>
 State health officials have promised $247,000 a year to run the county's 
program. And on Tuesday, the county Board of Supervisors eagerly endorsed the 
Health Care Agency's request to use another $63,875 grant to cover start-up 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so exciting," Supervisor Maria VanderKolk said at Tuesday's board 
meeting. "I'm just thrilled to see this coming to fruition." 
</P>
<P>
 Childhood immunization practices have become increasingly complex in the past 
decade, health officials note. As a result, immunization rates have been 
slipping. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen different shots are needed for full immunization against the highly 
infectious diseases of diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis (whooping cough), polio, 
measles, mumps, rubella, influenza Type B and hepatitis B. Further complicating 
matters, a new vaccine against chickenpox is coming on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has had only isolated cases of measles, whooping cough and other 
highly infectious diseases in recent years. And as required by schools, nearly 
all children are fully vaccinated by kindergarten. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many working parents have trouble making time to get their children 
vaccinated early, said Linda Glusac, the county's immunization coordinator. 
Some have neither a personal recollection of the devastation these diseases can 
cause, she said, nor an understanding of the need for diligence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to repeat the measles epidemics of 1989 and 1990," Glusac said. 
"The reason we are getting these epidemics is that kids from birth to 2 years 
old are not protected." 
</P>
<P>
 Public health statistics show that children from different ethnic groups and 
different incomes have similar immunization rates. But many health care workers 
see the computerized registry as having a bigger impact in poor communities and 
helping migrant farm workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Hinojosa, associate director of Clinicas del Camino Real, said he views 
the computer records as a way to avoid duplicating efforts to provide public 
health care to the less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We fully support it," Hinojosa said. He said Feldman has invited Clinicas 
staff to help plan the computer system and make it work. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept is also well-received by pediatricians in private practice. Once 
the system is up and running, each doctor's office would be able to dial into 
the system via modem, review the immunization records of new patients and 
update them with the latest vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great concept," said Dr. Robert E. Nopar of the Thousand Oaks 
Children's Medical Group. "Frequently, parents don't keep records with them. If 
there was a computerized registry, we could tell if they were up-to-date." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As planned, the county would encourage physicians to check computer records 
any time an infant or toddler comes in for a cold or other ailment. And, if 
needed, the visit would become another opportunity to deliver another 
inoculation. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Lawrence Spinner, a pediatrician in Thousand Oaks, said he had not heard 
about the county health officials' venture into the Information Age. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the surface, it sounds like a good idea," Spinner said. "It certainly 
would help ease the burden of obtaining immunization records, which can be a 
problem."

COASTAL PANEL REJECTS BEACHFRONT RV RESORT; PORT HUENEME: THE STATE COMMISSION 
FAILS TO APPROVE THE PLAN BY ONE VOTE. THE CITY IS INVITED TO REAPPLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission on Wednesday rejected the city of Port 
Hueneme's bid to build a 144-space recreational vehicle resort on a city-owned 
beach, declaring the site an environmentally sensitive habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 After a three-hour hearing in Eureka, the 12-member commission split 6 to 5 
with one abstention in favor of the resort. But seven votes were required for 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thrilled with our victory," said Port Hueneme City Councilwoman Toni 
Young, a principal opponent of the project. "The city deserves something better 
than a recreational vehicle resort on its beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Although denying the city's request, the commission approved a compromise 
proposal recommended by its staff. Under that plan, the beachfront project 
could be built if moved 290 feet north toward the municipal pier away from 
fragile sand dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city did not want to accept our staff recommendation," Coastal Commission 
Executive Director Peter Douglas said. "They wanted an up or down vote on their 
plan. . . . The commissioners who voted against (said) that they support an RV 
facility, but not on an environmentally sensitive habitat." 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission essentially invited the city to bring back an altered 
project by waving all deadlines for resubmission, Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Dorill Wright, a supporter of the project, said the city might 
reconsider its proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure the city will consider whether it's worth it to submit another 
proposal . . . or to just drop the entire project," Wright said. The other 
three council members could not be reached for comment late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, city officials said that they could not accept the 
commission staff's recommendation because that would delay the 5-year-old 
project another 12 months and would require a wholesale redesign. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright, who is also a coastal commissioner and voted for the resort Wednesday, 
expressed amazement at the city's loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am extremely disappointed," he said. "I did not expect this to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Wright's participation in the decision prompted criticism, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "The right and ethical thing for Mr. Wright to do would have been abstaining 
from voting," said project opponent Tom Brigham, who attended the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Wright said he voted on the project with a clear conscience 
because he had abstained when the Port Hueneme council approved it in May. 
Technically, he could have voted even if he had participated in the May 
decision, Douglas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's RV park proposal called for construction of the resort on a 10-acre 
beachfront site at the end of Ocean View Drive at Hueneme Beach Park. The 
project was vehemently opposed by environmentalists, who argued it would harm 
plants, grasses and wildlife in a nearby wetland habitat. The wetland is home 
for the California least tern, an endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 The city, which estimated that the resort would net $400,000 a year, spent 
more than $500,000 on environmental and market studies. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was also strongly opposed by some owners of the 375 condominiums 
next to the project. They argued that it would ruin their ocean views and 
reduce property values. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ecstatic. We are in seventh heaven," condo owner Katy Greenstreet said 
of the commission's vote. "We can't believe that we beat City Hall. This is the 
case when the voice of the people triumphed." 
</P>
<P>
 Greenstreet, along with several other beachfront residents, tagged victory 
signs reading "No RV Park" and "We are Saved" on their homes Wednesday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are jumping with joy around here," resident Elizabeth Isnec said. "I'm 
forever grateful that the value of our property will not decrease." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Sanders, a Sierra Club spokesman, said he plans to ask the City Council 
-- reconstituted by the November election -- to approve restoration of the 
nearby wetland vegetation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our work isn't done," Sanders said. "We want not only to protect the 
endangered species in the area, but also to provide the public with an 
opportunity to learn about them."

FORMER NURSE SUSPECTED OF THREE MOLESTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A former nurse at St. John's Regional Medical Center was arrested on suspicion 
of molesting patients while they were sedated, Oxnard police said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorden Butikofer, 37, was taken into custody at Los Angeles International 
Airport about 11:15 p.m. Tuesday, after an investigation by Oxnard police 
linked him to at least three instances of sexual battery of male patients at 
the hospital, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butikofer, 37, worked as a registered nurse at the hospital between January, 
1993, and May of this year, police said. He is accused of fondling three 
Ventura County men, all in their late 20s, during his employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the victims were brought to the hospital by ambulance after suffering 
injuries in traffic collisions, Oxnard Police Detective Bruce Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butikofer quit his job sometime in May to move to Utah, but the attacks went 
unreported to authorities for months, police said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Apparently the victims were reluctant to say anything," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard police arrested Butikofer after interviewing the victims and tracking 
him down in Utah through a forwarding address he left with St. John's 
officials, Reed said. But the detective declined to say how investigators 
determined that Butikofer would be at the airport Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital Administrator Daniel Herlinger said he was alerted sometime last 
year, while Butikofer was still employed at St. John's, that a patient had 
accused the nurse of sexual assault. But no disciplinary action was taken 
against Butikofer because the patient failed to cooperate in the hospital's 
internal investigation, Herlinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was one complaint" at that time, Herlinger said. "But there was no 
substantiation by the patient." 
</P>
<P>
 Herlinger said the two most recent alleged victims were injured in a traffic 
accident earlier this year.  
</P>
<P>
 "There were two people that came in at the same time, and when they got the 
bill, or several months after they were there, they made a complaint (against 
Butikofer)," Herlinger said. "But when we started to investigate . . . he had 
already quit." 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital contacted police immediately following those allegations, 
Herlinger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another St. John's employee faced criminal charges involving hospital patients 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Michelle Peralta of Oxnard, an emergency room clerk, was arrested on suspicion 
of stealing credit cards from sick and injured patients, then buying more than 
$10,000 in clothes at upscale department stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Peralta was fired from her job and later sentenced to 90 days in Ventura 
County Jail and four years probation after pleading guilty to four counts of 
theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Butikofer remains in county jail in lieu of $25,000 bail. He is scheduled to 
be arraigned today in Ventura County Municipal Court.

DEVELOPER ORDERED TO HALT PUMPING AT LAGOON; OXNARD: BALDWIN CO. IS ACCUSED OF 
VIOLATING COASTAL ACT BY ITS ACTIONS ON WETLANDS-DESIGNATED PROPERTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A state regulator has ordered a developer that wants to build 5,000 houses at 
Ormond Beach in Oxnard to stop pumping water from a fragile lagoon where 
endangered species are flourishing or face fines of up to $6,000 a day. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Coastal Commission hand-delivered a cease-and-desist order to 
the Baldwin Co. Wednesday, charging that the developer is violating the 
California Coastal Act by pumping water from 30 acres of inundated property 
that have been designated as wetlands for decades. 
</P>
<P>
 State permits are required to pump water from wetlands, commission officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County-based developer ignored a request last week to stop pumping 
water from its property, where California least terns and other endangered 
wildlife have recently been found in unusually high numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We clearly do not feel we are doing anything wrong," said Louis Malone, 
president of the Baldwin Co. division that includes Ventura County. "We're 
going to continue the pumping to protect our property." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Kern, the commission's enforcement analyst, said a biologist from the 
state Department of Fish and Game examined the lagoon Tuesday and found that 
pumping would harm several state and federally protected endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 "As of yesterday, we observed that pumping was continuing, and in fact had 
increased," Kern said. "The water level in the wetland was significantly 
lowered." 
</P>
<P>
 The J Street and E Street canals, which drain gutters in Oxnard, empty into 
the lagoon. In past years, the Ventura County Flood Control District has 
breached a sandbar to drain the lagoon, but it agreed to stop the practice last 
year while endangered least terns nested and their young matured. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, the endangered tidewater goby fish was found in the J Street canal, 
and regulatory agencies notified the flood control district that it would need 
permits to drain the wetlands from then on. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the lagoon has no outlet to the sea, it has begun flooding land in 
the area. Malone said the Baldwin Co. was left with no choice but to pump 
water. The company has spent between $30,000 and $40,000 erecting sandbags and 
pumping water from its property, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to cooperate every way with all the agencies," Malone said. "It 
seems like our only option is going to be the courts, because no one is paying 
attention to what is happening to us." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is investigating whether federal permits are 
also required to pump water from the area, a corps spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like there is a confusion as to jurisdiction," Malone said. "This is 
(Oxnard's) jurisdiction. We're really not sure if Coastal Commission permits 
are required." 
</P>
<P>
 The Baldwin Co. obtained an emergency pumping permit from Oxnard Wednesday, 
said Deanna Walsh of the city's Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Kern said while part of the disputed area is within Oxnard's primary 
jurisdiction, the Baldwin Co. still has to obtain permits from the Department 
of Fish and Game, Coastal Commission and possibly other agencies before pumping 
water from the lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Coastal Commission officials say they expect the Baldwin Co. to stop pumping 
immediately, but are prepared if the company chooses to ignore the stop order. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would file a lawsuit if necessary," Kern said. "We take it very seriously 
and we expect to enforce it."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; CITY EASES CONDITIONS ON DOUGHNUT SHOP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC SLATER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an unlikely scenario -- a doughnut shop allegedly luring criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 But the city Board of Zoning Appeals upheld this week an earlier decision that 
the Van Nuys shop had indeed become a public nuisance and should be required to 
meet several operating conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, however, eased some of those conditions, first imposed in July. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners of the doughnut shop, Orville's Originals at 6801 Sepulveda Blvd., 
would not have to erect gates to keep people out of the parking lot when it was 
closed, the board said Tuesday. Nor would Ulysses and Zuita Contador have to 
pay the city $4,062 for its investigation of the matter and hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 But the board ruled that limiting the shop's hours and requiring a night 
security guard was in order because there was enough evidence of illegal 
activity around the small Sepulveda Boulevard mall the doughnut shop shares 
with a handful of other businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is not to put anybody out of business. Our goal is to get rid of the 
nuisance," said Daniel Green, the associate zoning administrator who imposed 
the conditions after Tuesday's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Green first ruled against the business in July after testimony from police, 
neighbors and City Councilman Marvin Braude's staff that the doughnut shop and 
its parking lot had become a hangout for prostitutes and other criminals.  
</P>
<P>
 During review of the case, Green said, he could not tell for certain that it 
was the doughnut shop and not other businesses attracting the questionable 
element. Because other stores in the mall all close earlier in the evening, 
however -- with the exception of a nearby 7-Eleven previously slapped with its 
own operating conditions -- Orville's Originals would be the store most 
affected by restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Contadors could not be reached for comment. But self-proclaimed citizen 
crime fighter Mary Lou Holte -- who operates out of the doughnut shop -- said 
she was pleased with the board's easing of the conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the shop was under no obligation to implement the conditions while 
the case was being appealed, owners had already taken steps to address 
problems, Holte said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very impressed with the board," she said. "This business has (made 
changes) on their own," and the board took that into account. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of operating 24 hours, the shop now closes from midnight to 5 a.m. and 
has put up numerous signs, declaring illegal everything from loitering to 
having an open container of alcohol in the parking lot. ERIC SLATER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: WESTMINSTER; NEW 3-YEAR CONTRACT FOR CITY EMPLOYEES WILL 
INCLUDE SALARY HIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council unanimously this week approved a three-year contract with the 
municipal employees union that provides for a salary increase that will take 
effect in January. 
</P>
<P>
 But the raise will depend on how much police officers will receive under their 
own contract imposed by the City Council in July, according to Janie Miller, 
the city's personnel director who was a member of the city's negotiating team. 
</P>
<P>
 The police union contract guarantees that salaries of Westminster police 
officers will become the sixth highest in Orange County, from about 14th 
currently. 
</P>
<P>
 This would require at least a 3.5% salary increase, which is also the minimum 
that the municipal employees can expect, Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the contract, which took effect Tuesday, provides no salary increase 
this year. City and union representatives will reopen negotiations in 1996 to 
determine further pay increases, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the pay raise, employees will get one additional paid holiday 
-- Presidents Day -- and the opportunity to convert accumulated sick leave to 
cash up to a maximum of 240hours. 
</P>
<P>
 John Dorado, president of the 83-member municipal employees union, said that 
the pact was approved by union members Sept. 8. He said the union is satisfied 
with the contract, hammered out after more than 10 months of negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We met halfway," Dorado said. "It's good for the city and for the employees."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; A BOY'S BEST FRIEND IS HIS BIG BROTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM RAGAN

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Justin, 9, caught his first fish while camping last year, and James Sparks, 
32, was there to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy's catch was made possible by Sparks, who set up the camping trip in 
the Sierra. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks is Justin's Big Brother -- not by blood but by arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks met Justin through the Big Brothers-Big Sisters of Orange County two 
years ago, when Sparks joined. 
</P>
<P>
 Both are from Irvine, both like outdoor sports and both have been getting 
along beautifully since they met. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's my best friend," said Justin, whose father left him just before he was 
born. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole idea is for somebody to be there for Justin, someone to be a friend 
or a role model," said Sparks, an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks sees Justin, a third-grader at Vista Verde Elementary, once a week for 
three to six hours. Together, the two have gone ice skating, in-line skating, 
skiing and sledding. The idea isn't to become a father figure but to provide a 
male relationship that Justin might otherwise miss out on. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparks, a former YMCA instructor, said he decided to join the program because 
he missed the children he once coached. This time around, though, he wanted to 
develop a one-on-one relationship instead of dealing with kids in groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Lisa Mergl, the public relations director for the Big Brother-Big Sister 
Program, said 100 boys are waiting for Big Brothers. She said the Big Sister 
program doesn't have as much trouble finding matches.  
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call Mergl at (714) 544-7773 or show up at one of the 
orientation meetings, which take place at 7 p.m. every Thursday at the Big 
Brothers-Big Sisters office at 150 Yorba St., Tustin. TOM RAGAN

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GEORGE 
BURNS REPORTED JOKING WITH HIS NURSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comedian George Burns was reported sitting up and joking with nurses 
Wednesday, two days after surgery to drain fluid from his brain. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center planned to move the 98-year-old 
entertainer to a private room today and predicted he would be home within a 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Neurologist Martin Cooper and Burns' personal physician, Gary Sugarman, 
"expressed their satisfaction with how well George is doing," according to 
hospital spokesman Ron Wise. 
</P>
<P>
 The comic's longtime friend and manager, Irving Fein, told reporters during a 
hospital news conference that Burns had eaten his breakfast and was sitting up 
telling jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's had three or four nurses and he's doing his act. He's singing some of 
his songs that he does in his act. They are all laughing. He's having a good 
time," Fein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns underwent two hours of surgery after being admitted to the hospital 
Monday. The operation relieved pressure from fluid that built up after he 
injured his head when he fell in his bathtub.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MAN PRESUMED DEAD AFTER 
PIER JUMP IDENTIFIED AS EX-STANFORD SOCCER STAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF KASS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 29-year-old man who is believed to have drowned over the weekend after a 
common but dangerous beach escapade -- a jump off the Manhattan Beach Pier -- 
has been identified as a former Stanford soccer star who was attending business 
school at UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescue workers searched for three days but were unable to find the body of 
James Otis Cole Jr., 29. Officials say they believe the Manhattan Beach man 
died shortly after he jumped into the water with his roommate early Sunday. The 
roommate, Matthew Briger, 28, survived. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole's father, Clorox Co. executive James Cole Sr. of Oakland, said his son's 
friends indicated that he had jumped off the pier before. 
</P>
<P>
 "They jumped, they surfaced, they high-fived, and they started swimming in," 
is how Briger remembers the jump, Cole Sr. said.  
</P>
<P>
 But Cole began lagging behind, and when his roommate moved to help him, the 
pair were sucked under the pier by the current and pulled apart, police say. 
Someone heard their cries and called 911. 
</P>
<P>
 A lifeguard pulled the unconscious Cole onto a paddleboard about 100 yards 
south of the pier and tried to administer CPR. But a five-foot wave hit and 
separated the two, Los Angeles County Lifeguard Capt. Gary Crum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve divers searched each day for Cole, Crum said. In addition, friends and 
family formed a human chain and shuffled through shallow water. But Crum said 
Tuesday that the search had been suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Crum said he hoped Cole's death would dissuade others from making the leap, 
which is a misdemeanor. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything from suicide to thrills may motivate jumpers, said county Lifeguard 
Chief Don Rohrer. But drug or alcohol use, and a sense of machismo, often spark 
night jumps. Cole and Briger had been drinking beer but were not drunk, Cole 
Sr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cole graduated from Stanford with a degree in economics and lettered in 
soccer, playing briefly for the San Jose Earthquakes. He later managed a 
restaurant in Palo Alto and worked as an analyst with a number of financial 
companies, his father said. JEFF KASS

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MOUNTJOY PLEDGES TO 
STEP UP CAMPAIGN FOR SENATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK HOLGUIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Having scored a surprisingly easy victory over two formidable Republican 
challengers, Assemblyman Richard Mountjoy (R-Arcadia) pledged Wednesday to step 
up his campaign to win a runoff for the state Senate seat that Frank Hill 
vacated after his political corruption conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter that the ultraconservative Mountjoy is facing seemingly weak 
challenges in the Nov. 8 contest from Democrat Sandra K. Hester, Libertarian 
Matthew J. Piazza and Green Party candidate Walter R. Sheasby III. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll see a race that's twice as hard as my campaign for (Tuesday's) 
election," Mountjoy said. "I by no means take the race for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 The liberal Hester said she would forge ahead, acknowledging her underdog 
status. "The positions we hold are so opposite," Hester said. "(Voters) will 
have a clear choice with my candidacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy is the heavy favorite in the race because the 29th Senate District in 
eastern Los Angeles County is a Republican stronghold. In Tuesday's vote, for 
instance, the four Republican candidates won almost 85% of the votes cast, 
while Hester received about 14%. 
</P>
<P>
 The special election was set up when Hill, a Republican, resigned July 8, 
three weeks after a federal jury found him guilty of extortion, money 
laundering and conspiracy. He was sentenced earlier this week to 46 months in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's vote, Mountjoy easily overcame strong challenges from Assemblyman 
Paul Horcher (D-Diamond Bar) and Gary Miller, a wealthy Republican businessman. 
Mountjoy, a member of the Assembly since 1978, finished with about 45% of the 
vote, not enough to avoid a runoff but more than twice as much as Miller, who 
finished second. 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy said Wednesday that in the coming weeks he will continue to emphasize 
his longtime opposition to tax increases and his support of other conservative 
causes. The assemblyman is a strong backer of Proposition 187, which would cut 
educational, medical and other benefits to illegal immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 Hester, who opposes Proposition 187, said she hopes to attract the vote of 
Republican women with her support for abortion rights, which Mountjoy opposes. 
</P>
<P>
 The two other candidates who will appear on the November ballot -- Piazza and 
Sheasby -- each received less than 2% of the vote. RICK HOLGUIN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; 9 INJURED WHEN TRUCK SETS OFF MULTI-CAR CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nine people were injured -- including two critically -- in a chain-reaction 
crash involving a tractor-trailer and as many as 15 other vehicles on the 
westbound Ventura Freeway near Van Nuys Boulevard on Wednesday, the California 
Highway Patrol reported. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP spokesman Officer Dave King said the cause of the accident is still under 
investigation because of conflicting reports from witnesses. Initially, it was 
believed that the driver of the 18-wheel truck, David Thompson, was changing 
lanes when he apparently accelerated rather than decelerated, and the truck 
began hitting cars, which then hit other vehicles, according to King. 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the day, however, King said that other witnesses reported that the 
truck was attempting to avoid a collision in front of him. In doing so, the 
truck driver swerved to his right into other vehicles, which in turn hit other 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the other drivers just didn't know what happened," King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Dolin, 41, of Fullerton, came upon the 10:48 a.m. crash moments after it 
happened and called the CHP on his cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Smoke and dust was still coming off the cars," Dolin said. "There was a guy 
in a Mustang who was bleeding from his head and his face. I saw another guy 
crawling out of a Honda CRX. There was a guy on the ground next to a Blazer." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Fire Department spokesman Jim Wells said seven rescue ambulances 
and six fire companies with about two dozen firefighters responded to the 
crash. Eight of the nine injured were taken to five area hospitals. None of 
their identities was released. Wells said he did not know the details of any of 
the injuries. He said a woman who was pregnant suffered minor injuries. She was 
treated at the scene and then left on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the eight taken to hospitals were treated and released. A 21-year-old 
man was treated at Northridge Hospital Medical Center for multiple lacerations 
and a concussion and transferred to Kaiser Permanente Hospital. A 59-year-old 
man was admitted at Encino/Tarzana Regional Medical Center with head 
lacerations and a fractured neck. A 29-year-old man remained under observation 
at the same facility. 
</P>
<P>
 No victims were trapped in their cars, but many of the vehicles were severely 
damaged, Wells said. One vehicle caught fire minutes after the driver was 
removed. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP Sgt. A. J. D'Ambrosio said Thompson, who works for ARM & Associates and 
was hauling a load of beer, passed a sobriety test and is not expected to be 
cited for causing the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash caused traffic on the westbound 101 to back up to the Hollywood 
Freeway and created jams on surrounding surface streets for three hours. All 
the westbound lanes were closed temporarily when officials called for a 
helicopter to transport victims, but they reopened when the call was canceled 
after determining that the victims could be moved more quickly by ambulance. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate Fitzpatrick, 25, of Santa Monica said he was on his way to the Van Nuys 
Courthouse when he heard a crash and looked in his rear-view mirror just before 
the 18-wheeler struck his car from behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got hit from behind and hit my head on the steering wheel," Fitzpatrick 
said while standing on the freeway next to his late model Mercury Monarch, 
which had its front and rear right corners smashed. "I then got hit on the side 
and then pushed into another car in front of me." 
</P>
<P>
 Fitzpatrick said he was not injured except for some soreness in his shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 He seemed more worried, however, about missing his court appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll probably issue a warrant for my arrest now," he said, mentioning that 
he had been cited for allegedly selling cotton candy on the street without a 
permit. JULIO MORAN

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; IT'S OFFICIAL: TALL SHIP CALLS THIS 
PORT HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than a century after its predecessor swept the California coast for 
smugglers, the state's official tall ship slipped into local waters Wednesday 
for a more diplomatic mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Californian -- a copy of a 19th-Century schooner -- sailed, then motored, 
into the Port of Hueneme where it docked just long enough for a "First Call" 
ceremony welcoming the ship to its new home port. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of an $18,900 one-year contract with the Oxnard Harbor District, the 
145-foot ship will return to the Port of Hueneme in March for a longer visit. 
During that two-week stay, schoolchildren and sailing buffs will have a chance 
to tour the majestic ship, hoist the sails and learn about the coastal 
environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Other cities serving as home ports next year are Long Beach, Chula Vista and 
Monterey. 
</P>
<P>
 The Californian has made annual appearances at Channel Islands and Ventura 
harbors since 1986, but Wednesday marked the first time it had docked at the 
Port of Hueneme. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a terrific way to highlight the maritime community in Ventura County," 
said Kam Quarles, assistant to the harbor's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony was attended by children from the Boys & Girls clubs in Oxnard 
and Port Hueneme, harbor officials and shipping company executives. Afterward, 
the ship pulled up anchor and continued its voyage to San Diego where it will 
spend the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Californian was built 10 years ago and is modeled after the C.W. Lawrence, 
which was launched in 1846. For three years, the Lawrence patrolled the waters 
off California, performing many of the duties of the Coast Guard: assisting 
vessels in distress, collecting customs duties and serving as the only 
law-and-order off the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Lawrence was really, really busy when it got here," said Eric Christman, 
a former crewman on the Californian who now works for the nonprofit Nautical 
Heritage Society, which owns the reproduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequently, the C.W. Lawrence was called to help captains whose crews had 
abandoned their ships in San Francisco to prospect for gold in the Sierra 
foothills. And on one occasion, the Lawrence's crew was dispatched to arrest a 
crewman who had bitten the nose off one of his shipmates during a dispute, 
Christman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lawrence's glory days ended in November, 1851, when it ran aground on a 
beach near San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just got so stuck on the beach that they couldn't pull it off," Christman 
said. "So they salvaged it and stripped it down to the bare hull." JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; DESIGN PANEL DECIDES RINK SITE IS UNSAFE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposed site for Ventura's first outdoor skating rink for in-line hockey 
leagues is too close to the Ventura Freeway, the city's design review committee 
said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, which met Monday afternoon, is an advisory board only.Would-be 
builders of the rink on Arundell Avenue said they plan to appeal the decision 
to Ventura's Planning Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed," said Nicole Soroka, owner of Street Shark's In-Line 
Hockey League and In-Line Hockey Shop on Main Street. "My ultimate concern is 
safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Soroka and her in-line hockey-playing husband, Steve, decided to build the 
rink because their league has grown too large to fit into the busy schedule at 
an indoor rink in Oxnard, where they now play. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Soroka said they wanted to install a $100,000, partly prefabricated, 
180-by-80-foot rink. But members of the city committee worried about hazards 
from cars crashing off the highway and onto the facility. CONSTANCE SOMMER

 A pickup truck driver trying to secure his coffee cup swerved out of his lane 
and struck and killed an Oxnard motorcyclist early Wednesday north of 
Camarillo, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very sobering thing, to think that we all could make that mistake," 
said Sherrie Latimer, the California Highway Patrol officer who investigated 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcyclist, Thomas L. Sharp, 54, was on his way to work about 6:35 a.m. 
on Somis Road, south of West Street. Sharp, who worked for Ventura County 
Cablevision, died at 7:50 a.m. at St. John's Pleasant Valley Hospital in 
Camarillo, Deputy Coroner Dale Zintzis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the pickup, 26-year-old Shane A. Thiessen, "was in shock," 
Latimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Thiessen, like Sharp, was on his way to work, traveling south on 
Somis Road at about 50 m.p.h., when he reached down to secure his coffee cup in 
the center console and drifted across the double-yellow line. 
</P>
<P>
 When Thiessen looked up and saw the 1983 Honda motorcycle, he tried to swerve 
out of its path, Latimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp, who was wearing a helmet, died from chest and leg injuries, Zintzis 
said. Thiessen, who reported no injuries at the scene, was wearing his seat 
belt and might have escaped injury because of it, Latimer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharp is survived by his wife, Anita. GREG RIPPEE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; JUDGE DENIES RETRIAL DESPITE MISCONDUCT 
</P>

<P>
 A Ventura County judge refused to order a new trial Wednesday for an Oxnard 
man convicted of second-degree murder and robbery in June -- even though the 
judge agreed that there had been jury misconduct in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath said jurors improperly used a 
dictionary to look up the words "malice" and "forethought." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors are instructed to rely only on definitions provided by the court, 
attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the misconduct, McGrath said that defendant Hector Garcia's fair-trial 
rights were not violated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Superior Court jury found the 23-year-old Garcia guilty of killing Wayne 
Mansir, 24, of Oxnard. Authorities say that Mansir was shot after a 
disagreement with Garcia over how to split proceeds from a robbery that netted 
them $187,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Richard E. Holly argued that his client deserved a new 
trial. The jury's interpretation of the word malice was central to the case, he 
said. "It wasn't just any old word," Holly said. "It's the heart of the case." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Ellison told McGrath that the jurors quickly 
discovered they were not supposed to use the dictionary -- which they received 
from a court bailiff, he said -- and put it aside. 
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing in the case was set for Wednesday. DWAYNE BRAY

<P>
 A Ventura man accused of shooting a 13-year-old boy, who was left paralyzed, 
pleaded not guilty in Ventura County Superior Court on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After accepting the plea, Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath ordered the 
defendant, 21-year-old Brian Adams, to undergo a psychiatric examination as 
requested by the defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Adams' attorney, George C. Eskin, said a doctor could help determine whether 
Adams should change his plea to not guilty by reason of insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath set Adams' trial for Nov. 7. DWAYNE BRAY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: PLACENTIA YORBA LINDA; ATTENDANCE AT DISTRICT SCHOOLS UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First-day attendance in the Placentia-Yorba Linda Unified School District was 
up 750 students from last year to 22,400, and both El Dorado and Esperanza high 
schools reported record numbers of freshmen this year. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the second successive year the two high schools have seen significant 
increases in the number of freshmen registering for classes. 
</P>
<P>
 At El Dorado, freshmen account for slightly less than one-third of the total 
student body of 1,700. Typically, the school has about 350 freshman on the 
first day of classes, but on Tuesday 524 showed up. Last year's freshman class 
numbered about 500. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials estimate that much of the increase at El Dorado is a result 
of legislation several years ago that transferred a section of Yorba Linda from 
the Troy High School attendance area to El Dorado's attendance area. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshmen also registered in record numbers at Esperanza High School, where 
2,644 students showed up on the first day of school. The class of 1998 now 
numbers nearly 750, with more freshmen registering this week. Last year's 
freshman class was under 700 students. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the increase in district attendance can be attributed to 
population growth, Supt. James O. Fleming said the increase may also be due in 
part to the district's late start date. "When you start late, more kids show up 
on the first day of school," Fleming said. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPTON; PARENTS STORM 
SCHOOL OFFICE OVER TREATMENT OF LATINOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 100 angry parents stormed the office of a Compton elementary school 
Wednesday to protest what they called the district's unfair treatment of Latino 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Chanting loudly, the mostly Latino parents of McKinley Elementary School 
students occupied the building for more than two hours before they were ejected 
by the district's police officers and administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the demonstration was generally peaceful, officers arrested the 
group's leaders, Frank and John Madrid, soon after the protest ended. They were 
booked on suspicion of failing to disperse after officers ordered protesters to 
leave. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest was prompted in part by last week's transfer of Angelina Gonzalez, 
a parent and popular bilingual aide, to another school in the district. Parents 
said that McKinley, which has a large number of Spanish-speaking students, has 
failed to provide enough Latino instructors who could help students learn in 
their own language.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PASADENA; CITY PAYS 
$19,366 TO VENDORS FOR SOCCER FESTIVAL LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Pasadena has paid out a total of $19,366 to 10 vendors who 
complained they lost thousands of dollars after renting booth space at the 
city's Soccer Carnaval, a monthlong festival that coincided with the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The vendors also were given the right to sell their goods -- without paying a 
fee -- at various events at the Rose Bowl in the next year, including UCLA 
football games, the flea market and the upcoming Eagles and Rolling Stones 
concerts, according to settlement documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The city planned the carnival after World Cup organizers placed their official 
celebration, Soccerfest, in Los Angeles. But World Cup officials used their 
clout to keep the Soccer Carnaval from operating on game days, when the big 
crowds came to the city. Attendance was so sparse that the carnival ride 
operator packed up and left on the second day.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUMBO JET 
LANDS SAFELY AFTER BLOWING 2 TIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thai International Airways jumbo jet that had blown out two of its 18 tires 
on takeoff circled back to Los Angeles International Airport and landed safely 
about 4:30 p.m. Wednesday, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Airport officials said that before returning to LAX, the Boeing 747-400 -- 
which had been bound for Seoul and Bangkok with 390 passengers and crew -- 
circled for about half an hour over the ocean to dump fuel in order to lighten 
the plane's load and reduce pressure on the tires. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they added, the problem was not serious because the damaged tires 
were not part of the jet's nose gear. Passengers on Flight 771 said later that 
many aboard were unaware that a problem had occurred until the plane turned 
back to LAX.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: MALIBU; TYLER TRUST 
GIVES $32.5 MILLION TO PEPPERDINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pepperdine University has been given $32.5 million, the largest single gift in 
the history of the Malibu school, by the trust of noted Los Angeles 
philanthropist John C. Tyler. 
</P>
<P>
 The trust, established by Tyler and his wife, Alice, before his death in 1973, 
named Pepperdine as its chief beneficiary.The process of turning the money over 
to Pepperdine began after Alice died last year at age 80, and the announcement 
that it had been received was made this week. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the university said about 80% of the gift would be added to 
the school's endowment, with much of the rest being used for capital 
improvements. Included in the latter is the renovation of a student center 
named for the Tylers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Their previous generosity has touched every Pepperdine student's life in some 
way and this recent gift will have even more profound influence on the entire 
university community," said Pepperdine President David Davenport. Before the 
Tyler gift, the school's endowment was about $110 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tylers also made major contributions to the University of Southern 
California and a number of other institutions. The Tyler Building at USC houses 
the Delinquency Control Institute they supported, and the John and Alice Tyler 
Prize for Environmental Achievement awards $150,000 annually to the scientist 
judged to be a "guardian of the future."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: CALABASAS; SUPERVISORS 
OK HOUSING PROJECT IN ECOLOGICAL AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Capping eight years of debate, Los Angeles County supervisors have approved a 
housing project near Calabasas at a fraction of its original size, and given up 
on a plan to extend an unpopular four-lane highway through the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The board granted the developer of the Malibu Terrace project permission to 
build a 4.5-acre commercial project and 110 houses in the sensitive ecological 
area along Las Virgenes Road north of the Ventura Freeway -- less than a tenth 
of the 1,816 houses proposed in 1986.The supervisors also designated 400 acres 
of the 500-acre property as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The board dropped plans to extend Thousand Oaks Boulevard about a mile east 
through the property over the objections of the county's road department, which 
recommended building the road as the first step toward creating an alternative 
to the Ventura Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 In lieu of the road, the supervisors ordered Las Virgenes Properties to pay 
the county $600,000 for regional transportation improvements, such as bridge 
widening and traffic signal installation.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; GALLERIA SEEKS OK FOR MAJOR RENOVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks Galleria will seek city approval for a multimillion-dollar 
renovation plan that would add an open-air plaza and expand dining and 
entertainment facilities, mall officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 City planning officials must examine architectural designs to approve a zoning 
change for the project, which officials said is still in the conceptual phase. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're at such preliminary stages, we don't even have design drawings at this 
point," said mall General Manager Joy M. DeBacker. "And there have been no cost 
estimates made at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the proposed renovation, DeBacker said, is to contribute to the 
"economic resurgence in the area" following the Northridge earthquake, and to 
remain competitive with other regional shopping centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Architectural plans for the renovation are being developed by Los 
Angeles-based Altoon + Porter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 600,000-square-foot mall, which has been serving the San Fernando Valley 
since the early 1980s, is owned by Galleria Joint Venture. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary plans include increasing pedestrian access by replacing part of 
the five-story Garden Office building on Sepulveda Boulevard with an open-air 
pedestrian plaza offering upscale dining and entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing retail space would also be converted into restaurant use and the 
existing Pacific Theatres movie complex would be expanded to accommodate up to 
22 screens. 
</P>
<P>
 The Robinson-May department store and most other existing specialty retail 
stores would be expected to remain in operation, DeBacker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public hearings on the renovation project, DeBacker said, could begin early 
next year. JEFF SCHNAUFER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DANA POINT; ROOF PUTS THE LID ON COUPLE'S SEA VIEW

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Link family has a problem that's common in coastal Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years after Lowell and Penny Link bought their dream home on a Dana 
Point hillside overlooking the Pacific Ocean, they found a new roofline poking 
skyward between their living room window and the blue water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We bought for location and we bought for view," said Lowell Link, 58, a San 
Clemente-based real estate agent. "Now all we have is location." 
</P>
<P>
 The steeply pitched roof belongs to a $750,000, 6,500-square-foot sewer 
district operations building under construction across the street from the 
Links' home in the Village at Dana Point development. 
</P>
<P>
 They had been told it would be a one-story building, but not that its roof 
would rise 26 feet, high enough to cut off their treasured blue-water view, the 
sailboats on the horizon and the picturesque old Pacific Coast Highway bridge 
over San Juan Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 The frustrated Links have made belated appeals to the city and the sewer 
district and gotten little response, other than a suggestion that it's too late 
to make any alterations. Construction has been underway for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to the city and they said I need to talk to the sewer district," 
Link said. "When I talked to the sewer district they said talk to the city." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they notified all property owners within 500 feet of the 
project and the Links' neighbors did attend planning commission meetings, 
voicing concerns over landscaping to screen the sewer treatment basins, city 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Bowie, attorney for the sewer district, the Southeast Regional 
Reclamation Authority, said that since the roof is up, it is too late for the 
SERRA board to spend public funds to alter it.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think all we can do is say we are very sorry," Bowie told the Links at a 
recent sewer board meeting. "I would like to be able to say something more 
comforting." 
</P>
<P>
 The Links are considering hiring an attorney, said Lowell Link. "What else can 
we do?" LEN HALL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the Laguna Beach Fire Department's first and second in command both 
preparing to retire in December, City Manager Kenneth C. Frank announced 
Wednesday that the city has selected a new fire chief. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park Fire Department Battalion Chief William Edmundson will replace 
Chief Richard Dewberry, who retires at the end of this year after 24 years with 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Battalion Chief Joe McClure will retire Dec. 3 after 26 years of 
service. He has not yet been replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Dewberry and McClure said Wednesday they are eager to spend time on other 
projects, and both agreed that fighting last fall's firestorm was the most 
dramatic event of their careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to call it a highlight of my career because it certainly had the 
negative downside because we lost so many homes," Dewberry said. "On the other 
hand, there was also a tremendous amount of property saved." 
</P>
<P>
 Also in December, the city will lose Police Capt. William Cavenaugh, who is 
retiring Dec. 30 after three decades with the force. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank attributes the three coinciding retirements with improved retirement 
benefits approved by the city about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have enacted a new public safety retirement system that is more generous 
and makes it easier for police and fire people to retire earlier than they have 
in the past," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Dewberry, 50, said he will breed cattle at the farm where grew up in Alabama. 
He intends to eventually retire there. 
</P>
<P>
 McClure, 52, said he will stay in Laguna Beach for a while and take time to 
pursue hobbies such as sculpting and woodcarving. Eventually, he plans to move 
to Anza in Northern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Cavenaugh, 51, said he will move to Yreka City in Northern California the day 
after he retires.LESLIE EARNEST

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; TRUSTEES CONSIDERING SITE FOR NEW COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Saddleback Community College District is considering a 300-acre parcel as 
a possible site for a third campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the consideration is described as preliminary, trustees have asked an 
architectural firm to determine how much of the vacant parcel can be used for 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the firm, which is preparing a review of the district's 
campuses in Mission Viejo and Irvine, gave a brief oral report to trustees last 
month during a closed session. A final written report is expected within the 
next few months, according to district spokeswoman Diane Riopka. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300 acres is in the northeast part of the city, north of Avenida Pico and 
Avenida La Pata, on a spot where developers originally planned to build a 
residential and commercial project, said Dave Lund, the city's economic 
development manager. 
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; OWNERS COMPLAIN ABOUT ANIMAL-LICENSING 
TACTICS 
</P>

 When Francine DeFrance's teen-age son heard the doorbell ring about three 
weeks ago, he did not hide the family cat in the closet. 
</P>
<P>
 DeFrance now wishes he had. 
</P>
<P>
 She has since received two strongly worded warnings threatening court action 
from the Southeast Area Animal Control Authority for harboring an unlicensed 
feline. During the citywide door-to-door search for unlicensed dogs and cats, a 
representative of the Animal Control Authority spotted her 1-year-old Siamese 
cat, Maui, after her son answered the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like a house search," DeFrance said, complaining to council members 
Monday night about what she believes is a heavy-handed approach to pet license 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Gwen Forsythe said she has received several complaints from 
residents about "not a real gracious door-to-door-type situation" involving 
animal licensing representatives. The City Council pledged to review the 
license operations, but they will continue. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach contracted with the Animal Control Authority to canvass the entire 
city in search of unlicensed dogs and cats. The organization provides animal 
care services for a dozen cities in southeast Los Angeles County. Seal Beach 
has its own animal control services, but is using the Animal Control Authority 
to generate money to handle the increasing costs of animal control.  
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach is one of the few cities in the state that requires licenses for 
cats, according to Aaron Reyes, licensing supervisor for the Animal Control 
Authority. Reyes said he understands the wounded feelings of cat owners, but 
added that cats are responsible for half of all animal control costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not uncommon for cat owners to feel a little threatened or picked on," 
Reyes said. RUSS LOAR

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: IRVINE; COUNCIL REJECTS INVOLVEMENT IN HUD SMALL-BUSINESS 
LOAN PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The City Council gave a unanimous thumbs down Tuesday night to a loan program 
that would have provided $500,000 in federal money to small businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Before voting, council members worried aloud that the Chamber of 
Commerce-endorsed program would put the city in the uncomfortable position of 
picking "winners and losers" among loan applicants and foreclosing on 
businesses that fail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems like government would be getting into a business they shouldn't 
be getting into," Mayor Michael Ward said. "I think it would end up being a big 
mess." 
</P>
<P>
 A representative from the Department of Housing and Urban Development tried to 
assure council members Tuesday night that Costa Mesa, Los Angeles and a number 
of other cities have successfully administered the program at no financial 
risk. The community development block grants funding the program are 
distributed by HUD. 
</P>
<P>
 But most council members balked at the city government's overseeing business 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Paula Werner said $100,000 in HUD funds would still be available 
in grants for capital programs for city social service agencies. She said the 
money could be used to purchase an additional residential unit for Irvine 
Temporary Housing, a nonprofit agency that houses families for up to six 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's finance commission had approved the small-business loan program as 
part of a larger business-incentives package, which includes funding to 
encourage businesses to locate in Irvine and a bank-guaranteed bond program 
that would offer $1-million to $10-million business loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will discuss the remainder of the business-incentives package at 
its next regular meeting on Sept. 27. RUSS LOAR

EAST COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CITY WILL DONATE SERVICES FOR SEMINAR

<P>
 They may not be able to round up a red carpet, but Thousand Oaks council 
members have agreed to contribute $3,000 worth of services to a seminar on the 
Global Information Age, which former Vice President Dan Quayle is expected to 
attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Passport to Tomorrow," the international conference will bring foreign 
dignitaries and journalists to the new Civic Arts Plaza next month for a 
daylong caucus on the information superhighway. Thousand Oaks' contribution 
will come mainly in the form of labor, to help set up the event and film it for 
local cable. The World Affairs Council of Ventura County, a nonprofit group, 
plans the event for Oct. 27. STEPHANIE SIMON

<P>
 Ventura County residents hoping to get an early flu shot from public clinics 
will have to turn to private doctors or wait until November, county health 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers delayed the statewide release of the shots, which were due to 
arrive at county clinics this month, the Ventura County Public Health 
Department announced Tuesday.No explanation for the delay was offered. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior citizens, young people and adults with chronic health problems are 
encouraged to be vaccinated to avoid serious health problems associated with 
the flu. 
</P>
<P>
 People on Medicare or MediCal can go to a private doctor to receive flu 
vaccine, county health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Public Health Department has tentatively rescheduled flu clinics for 
November. More information on the clinics will be available later this month, 
officials said. MATTHEW MOSK

ANOTHER BAD BREAK FOR HOLLYWOOD BLVD.; SUBWAY: THIS TIME, RED LINE WORKERS 
RUPTURE A WATER MAIN, LEAVING BUSINESSES WITHOUT SERVICE. LAST MONTH, TUNNELING 
CAUSED THE STREET TO SINK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Another MTA mishap hit Hollywood Boulevard on Wednesday when workers on the 
Red Line project ruptured a water main, unleashing a geyser in the direction of 
the Pantages Theater and forcing about 20 businesses to spend much of the day 
without running water. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the broken main caused no property damage and Hollywood Boulevard 
remained open, tempers were short after the second MTA construction problem in 
a month on the beleaguered boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA had ceased tunneling in the Hollywood Boulevard area after its 
construction of a Red Line tunnel caused the street to sink as much as nine 
inches in August, but work continued on the planned Hollywood and Vine station, 
a few blocks east of the area with the greatest sinkage. On Wednesday, workers 
there were digging to locate water mains so they would not rupture them in the 
upcoming excavation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we hit this one," said Tom Horton, utilities coordinator for the MTA's 
Red Line project. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton said the eight-inch main that was broken Wednesday could cause further 
sinkage. August's sinkage was caused in part by broken mains saturating the 
soil over a Red Line tunnel and causing the ground to subside. Horton said 
engineers were carefully watching the tunnels under the affected stretch of the 
boulevard. Supports are on hand nearby if the tunnels begin to sag, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Local business owners were not pleased. "These people have no idea what the 
hell they're doing!" fumed Stan Seiden, president of the Pantages Theater, as 
he stormed past torn asphalt and hard-hatted engineers on his way to work 
Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs at the theater boast that it's "The best place to play in L.A.," but 
that wasn't the case Wednesday. "It's horrible, they're killing our business," 
Seiden said. "I'm going to turn this over to my attorney." 
</P>
<P>
 Water on the street was shut off at 8:30 a.m., and by 4:30 p.m. had been 
restored to most businesses on Hollywood between Gower and Vine streets. The 
boulevard has already been partially closed for two months because of the 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimated that 20 to 25 businesses were affected by the shut-off 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We apologize," MTA spokeswoman Andrea Greene said. "We know how extremely 
frustrating this is. We also know how tremendous a system Metro Rail will be 
when it opens a couple of years from now. When you embark on so mammoth a 
project, things like this happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Dayyam, owner of Ronnie's Donuts a few doors from the break, is also 
looking forward to the opening of Metro Rail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sooner they're done the better," Dayyam said. His shop was almost empty 
at lunch hour Wednesday, and without running water he was forced to use bottled 
Evian to brew coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're expecting to come down and get their cup of coffee," Dayyam said. 
"You can't disappoint the customers." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sale!" blared pink cardboard signs next to the Pantages, outside Etoile Inc., 
but to no avail. Fouad Nasri, the clothing store's owner, stared out at his 
empty shop. He said the street construction has chased away customers, and the 
water main break may be the final blow. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've died," he said, estimating that the store has lost about $200,000 
during the construction.

FIRE STARTED BY 6-YEAR-OLD KILLS 3, INJURES 4 IN SOUTH GATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO and SHAWN HUBLER, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman and two children were killed and four others were injured when a fire 
ignited by a 6-year-old playing with a cigarette lighter swept through a South 
Gate garage apartment that had no smoke alarm, fire officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Two single mothers with five small children were in the tiny guest house at 
9227 Dearborn Ave. late Tuesday night when two of the children -- who had been 
momentarily left unattended in the living room -- flicked the lighter and 
accidentally ignited lace draperies, said County Fire Capt. Steve Valenzuela. 
</P>
<P>
 Within moments, Valenzuela said, the room was engulfed. By the time the 
younger of the two little boys ran to the next room for their mother about 
10:25 p.m., the entire house was on fire, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela said the mother, Juana Hernandez, a 39-year-old visitor who was 
spending the night with her 6- and 4-year-old sons, rushed to the living room 
and tried to rescue them. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as we can tell, she managed to get out with the 4-year-old through a 
kitchen window," the captain said. "But the older boy didn't make it" and was 
pronounced dead at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the occupants of the house, 31-year-old Maria Castillo and her 
three little girls, sought refuge in the two back rooms, Valenzuela said. 
Firefighters found Castillo, an unemployed Salvadoran maid, locked in a 
bathroom with one of her 3-year-old twins; her older daughter, 8-year-old 
Erica, was found unconscious in the unit's sole bedroom with the other twin, 
the captain said. 
</P>
<P>
 The twins survived, but Erica was pronounced dead at St. Francis Medical 
Center in Lynwood an hour after the blaze. Castillo, who was taken to Martin 
Luther King/Drew Medical Center, died Wednesday evening after lingering on a 
life-support system for almost 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 City and fire officials said the three-room apartment -- which had been 
constructed as a duplex rental unit at least 40 years ago -- lacked a smoke 
detector. Smoke detectors, Valenzuela said, have been required in all multiple 
family units since 1987 under the county fire code. 
</P>
<P>
 The South Gate City Council called an emergency meeting for 5 p.m. today to 
discuss whether the city should pass a smoke detector ordinance of its own. But 
fire officials said the flames spread so rapidly that it was unclear whether 
the devices would have helped. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all happened so quickly," said neighbor Gabriel Roque, 40, who tried to 
save Castillo's family but was driven back by the flames. The tragedy, he and 
others said, was only the latest hardship for Castillo, who had been forced to 
stop working after the birth of her twins, one of whom had a disabling heart 
defect.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; LONE RANGER STILL RIDING A HAPPY TRAIL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Certain notions are set in granite in the view of Clayton Moore, alias the 
Lone Ranger: The good guys always wear white hats, fight for what they think is 
right and, above all, see to it that justice prevails. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll always wear the white hat," Moore said. "The white hat has always been 
the symbol of justice, fair play and honesty." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who turned 80 Wednesday, said he has no regrets and would live his life 
all over again the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 He is long retired, but still relishes the idea that in the public mind, 
Clayton Moore will forever be the Lone Ranger, the masked crusader who always 
ended his long-running television show with the famous cry "Hi-yo Silver!" 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said that these days, people often don't recognize him as the masked 
man. But as soon as they hear his voice, they make the connection. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'I know that voice, I know that voice, you're the Lone Ranger!' " 
he said Wednesday during a telephone interview from his Calabasas home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can call me the Lone Ranger any time they want," he added. "I love it. 
The Lone Ranger character was a great person to portray." 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of each episode, the Lone Ranger would ride off into the sunset, 
before anyone he had helped had a chance to thank him.  
</P>
<P>
 Today Moore, in a seeming parody of that mysterious masked man, values his own 
privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 A party to celebrate his birthday Wednesday was to be a private affair, he 
said, brushing off a reporter's questions about where it would be held and who 
would attend. Moore's publicist also warned against asking questions about the 
masked man's personal life or business matters relating to his career as the 
Lone Ranger. Moore turned down requests for face-to-face interviews and would 
not allow photographers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm retired from that," he said. "I've done all my personal appearances." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore first appeared as the Lone Ranger on television in 1949. He left the 
show, then returned from 1954 to 1957. After that, he continued to portray the 
Western hero in personal appearances. But Wrather Corp., which owned the rights 
to the character, wanted to make a feature movie about the Lone Ranger and in 
1979 obtained a court order preventing Moore from portraying the character. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie flopped and Moore fought in court to regain the right to portray the 
hero. Finally in 1984, Wrather agreed that Moore could appear in public in 
dark, masked-shaped sunglasses in place of the black mask.  
</P>
<P>
 He was born Jack Carlson Moore, the son of a real estate broker, in Chicago on 
Sept. 14, 1914. He performed in a trapeze act in the circus for several years 
and first appeared in films in 1938, playing bit parts. 
</P>
<P>
 A longtime fan of the Lone Ranger radio show, Moore tried out with 75 other 
actors for the TV version. When told by producer George Trendle that he had the 
part, Moore replied: "Mr. Trendle, I am the Lone Ranger." 
</P>
<P>
 Jay Silverheels, who played his Indian sidekick, Tonto (and who died in 1980), 
was "a good friend on the screen as well as off the screen," Moore said.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked how he remains so idealistic in today's problem-plagued world, Moore 
said: "I love my country. We have a great country. We should always work to 
preserve law and order, fair play and honesty." FRANK MANNING

EAST COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; COLLEGE STUDENT PLANS WRITE-IN MAYORAL BID 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 19-year-old Simi Valley resident has announced plans to wage a write-in 
campaign for mayor against incumbent Greg Stratton. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Rodriguez, a political science major at Moorpark College, obtained 
papers Wednesday for the November race. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his name will not appear on the ballot because he missed the filing 
deadline, Rodriguez insisted that he is running a serious campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know the odds are against me, but I am very serious about this," Rodriguez 
said. "Running for mayor will give me knowledge about how the city works, and 
in general it will be a great learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez, who was born and raised in Simi Valley, graduated from Royal High 
School in 1993, where he played center on the football team. He has completed 
two semesters at Moorpark College and works part time as a bank teller. 
</P>
<P>
 When not working or attending classes, Rodriguez volunteers at St. Rose of 
Lima Church in the youth ministry program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I teach morals, like abstinence before marriage," he said. "I'm a virgin by 
choice, which is a pretty difficult thing in this day and age." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez said he gained an appetite for politics while working on Pete 
Wilson's campaign for governor. He is the only candidate challenging Stratton, 
who is running for a fifth term. SARA CATANIA

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD; VETERAN WILL GET HIS MEDAL -- 27 YEARS LATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After 27 years, the Army will finally make things right for Paul Calcaterra of 
Oxnard next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 48-year-old veteran has been waiting -- patiently -- since January, 1967, 
when he clambered into a bat-riddled mountain cave on a reconnaissance mission 
in Vietnam's central highlands. 
</P>
<P>
 The North Vietnamese often would use underground caves and caverns to stash 
troops and arms, and it was Calcaterra's job to go underground and survey what 
was there. The day before, another private was killed on a similar mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he immediately encountered hostile forces, Calcaterra saw enough to 
inform his superiors that the cave contained a Viet Cong medical complex and 
arms storage area. 
</P>
<P>
 For Calcaterra's bravery that day, his company commander, James T. Scott, 
requested that his scout receive the Silver Star, the Army's third highest 
medal. In a subesquent battle that year, Calcaterra was wounded and received a 
Purple Hart. He was shipped stateside shortly afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 But for 27 years, the former soldier never received the coveted medal that he 
won for his bravery in the cave. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, three years ago, after more than 20 years had slipped by, he saw his old 
commander on television during the Persian Gulf War. A short time later, a 
friend suggested that Calcaterra inquire about the status of the award. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote to Scott, and the general verified to the military that he had 
requested the honor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy to finally be getting my medal," Calcaterra said. "It means a 
lot to me and a lot to my friends who are vets." 
</P>
<P>
 Army officials said Tuesday that they don't know why the ex-serviceman failed 
to get his medal, but are glad that he will finally receive his honors next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time to wait," Lt. Col. Ken McGraw, an Army spokesman, said. 
"I do know that the general has been very anxious to do what he can to get this 
man his medal." 
</P>
<P>
 Calcaterra, now a veterans claims officer for Ventura County, will be honored 
by his former commander, now a three-star general, during ceremonies Sept. 22 
at Point Mugu Naval Air Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe (General) Scott a debt of gratitude," Calcaterra said. "Just like back 
in Vietnam, he was always loyal to his troops to the end." J.E. MITCHELL

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: TIMETABLE COMING FOR MTA OVERHAUL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A timetable for the first major overhaul in two decades of the San Fernando 
Valley's grid bus system will be developed by November, officials said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin E. White, head of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, said his 
agency is already at work on a plan for implementing several changes outlined 
in a sweeping restructuring study unveiled last June. 
</P>
<P>
 The study recommended scrapping the traditional grid system of bus routes in 
favor of a hub-and-spoke layout that would improve service to employment 
centers and other transit stops. 
</P>
<P>
 White said MTA staff would present a timetable for the innovations to the 
agency's board of directors in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The restructuring plan recommended that the MTA abandon bus lines confined 
only to north-south and east-west travel and replace them with routes serving 
major commercial and retail destinations and hubs such as Metrolink stations 
and future Metro Rail stops. 
</P>
<P>
 Synchronized schedules would allow for quicker transfers, and high-frequency 
shuttles would enable residents to travel with greater ease within communities. 
</P>
<P>
 If implemented, the changes would be the first to hit the Valley bus system in 
20 years, when the grid system was adopted. The proposals were drafted by a 
task force of city and county agencies. HENRY CHU

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA NEWPORT BEACH; PLAN FOR DRUG-SNIFFING DOGS 
MOVES AHEAD

<P>
 The Newport-Mesa Unified School District is moving ahead with a drug-deterrent 
program that would bring police dogs onto high school campuses to sniff out 
illegal substances in lockers and parked vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education on Tuesday directed that the pilot program continue to 
be developed by the district's Advisory Committee on Alcohol and Drug 
Abuse.Input on the plan's details will be provided by parents, teachers and 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is expected to take action on Oct. 11, before actually bringing the 
police dogs onto campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Edward H. Decker said the district is fortunate in that it 
does not have a serious drug problem in the schools. However, he said, "we are 
not so naive as to think the problem is nonexistent." 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years ago the board adopted our zero-tolerance policy for drugs and 
alcohol," Decker said. "In the first year, the district disciplined a total of 
40 kids under this policy. Last year, that number dropped to 28 districtwide. 
With the use of specially trained dogs, we hope to reduce disciplinary cases to 
zero." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials are hoping that widespread awareness of the dog program 
will result in students deciding not to bring illegal substances onto school 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 The dogs would be provided by the Costa Mesa and/or Newport Beach police 
departments. ALAN EYERLY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COSTA MESA; ANTI-GANG GROUP GETS TWO-WAY RADIOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mothers Costa Mesa, a group determined to stop gang activity in the city, has 
received four two-way radios -- compliments of Coalition for a Responsible 
Government. 
</P>
<P>
 The radios, which can be attached to belt buckles, operate with little 
interference and can reach Costa Mesa police in a matter of seconds, said Larry 
Weichman, a member of the coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The group of about 20 mothers patrols schoolyards and bus stops during 
different times of the day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the mothers have problems with gangs in the afternoons when some of 
the children get off the school buses," Weichman said. "These radios could help 
stop gang members from recruiting because the mothers will now have a direct 
line to police." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Gilbert, president of a manufacturing company in Costa Mesa and a 
director of the coalition, worked with several businesses to raise money to 
purchase the radios. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, the four radios cost $1,200, and they were presented recently to Roy 
Alvarado, a gang counselor who works with the Newport-Mesa Unified School 
District to reduce gang membership. 
</P>
<P>
 The Costa Mesa Chamber of Commerce, Mesa Pride, Kiwanis of North Costa Mesa, 
Real Estaters, Bear Communications, Fleet Call and the Newport Mesa Assn. of 
Realtors played a part in purchasing the radios. 
</P>
<P>
 The coalition meets once a month, usually on Wednesdays. The purpose is to 
promote and enhance the quality of life in Costa Mesa.TOM RAGAN

EAST COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PARKING SPOTS SAVED IN INTERSECTION PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to please commuters without hurting local businesses, Thousand Oaks 
council members have settled on a $140,000 plan for improving the intersection 
of Thousand Oaks Boulevard and Hampshire Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Most early proposals from the city's traffic department had called for 
eliminating parking spaces in front of small businesses along Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard to widen the street.But the pleas of Regina Chiaramonte, who owns a 
tailoring shop that depends on curbside parking, prompted all five council 
members to demand alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 The new plan preserves parking in front of Chiaramonte's business and in front 
of a liquor store and jewelry shop on Hampshire Road. To allow customers easy 
access to the liquor and jewelry stores, U-turns on Hampshire Road will still 
be permitted. 
</P>
<P>
 But a dozen parking spaces on Thousand Oaks Boulevard east of Hampshire Road 
will be eliminated. STEPHANIE SIMON

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: CYPRESS; COUNCIL AGAIN REJECTS HOUSING PROJECT PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BILLITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council this week unanimously voted down, for a second time, a 
low-cost housing project proposed by county government. 
</P>
<P>
 The council initially turned down the project on Aug. 22, when it was first 
proposed.Supporters of low-cost housing tried to persuade the council again 
Monday night, but no votes were swayed. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's proposal called for converting the bankrupt Tara Village 
Apartment Complex in the 5200 block of Lincoln Avenue into housing for low- and 
moderate-income families. County government officials said they would finance 
the project with a $1-million bond issue underwritten by the federal 
government. They said there would be no cost either to Cypress or county 
taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members said they had reservations about the proposal. Councilwoman 
Gail Kerry said that Cypress already has exceeded its quota for low-cost 
housing and has no pressing need for the county-backed project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been doing an excellent job of providing housing," Kerry said. Council 
member Joyce Nicholson added, "We've already met 110% of our goal, and we're 
one of the few cities in the state to be doing so well." 
</P>
<P>
 The county proposal called for having the Foundation for Social Resources Inc. 
own and operate the 170-unit apartment complex after it was rehabilitated and 
converted into low-cost housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hirsch, president of the Huntington Beach-based nonprofit foundation, 
urged the council to approve the project. Hirsch said Cypress would benefit by 
having a deteriorating property rehabilitated at no city expense.BILL BILLITER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; GETTY GIFT WILL HELP CSUN ARTS PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAKI BECKER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $1-million gift from the J. Paul Getty Trust to Cal State Northridge will 
help the university rebuild and restore visual arts programs that were hit hard 
by the January earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cal State Northridge has had a leading art history department for years, as 
well as a strong fine arts department," said Getty Trust President Harold 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is vital to the future of our city that CSUN not only recover from the 
losses but to continue to build the quality for programs that we have come to 
expect," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Half the money will go directly to the School of the Arts, where it will be 
used to buy equipment for a new visual arts computer lab and for studio arts 
courses, such as painting and ceramics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Getty gift will also help purchase audiovisual equipment to outfit a new 
lecture room for the School of the Arts, said Philip Handler, dean of the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other departments of the university will share the remaining $500,000 
donated to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The University Library, the School of Communication, Health and Human Services 
and the School of Humanities will use the money for their own programs relating 
to the visual arts, according to CSUN officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's art collection, which was partially housed in the badly damaged 
Oviatt Library, will also benefit from the gift. With the Getty funds, the 
university will frame and mount many artworks it owns in a manner that will 
better ensure their long-term preservation, Handler explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the pieces in the collection is a series of oils, pastels and prints by 
Swiss-born artist Hans Burkhardt, who taught at CSUN in the 1960s and 1970s. 
Burkhardt was renowned for his expressionistic depictions of war. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oviatt Library's special collections archives received $340,000 from the 
Getty Trust. Those funds will be used in restoring and conserving CSUN's 
historical collections, and making them available to the public, said Sue 
Curzon, dean of the university's Oviatt Library. 
</P>
<P>
 Curzon said CSUN's vast array of musical scores and recordings by female 
composers will also be catalogued with funds from the Getty Trust. The 
university's collection is one of the most comprehensive of its kind in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Marshall, a CSUN archivist, said he is especially looking forward to 
being able to transcribe taped oral histories recounted by women who worked on 
the docks of Los Angeles decades ago. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN UTILITIES PLANT DELAYED BY FINANCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A much-needed $22-million utilities plant at Cal State Northridge -- along 
with most of the Cal State system's pending capital projects -- will be delayed 
at least a year because voters rejected one bond measure and the state 
Legislature balked at another, officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The CSUN project, along with many others, had been slated for construction 
this school year.But those plans died when state voters in June rejected 
Proposition 1C, a $900-million higher-education bond measure. 
</P>
<P>
 State lawmakers have failed to put another measure on the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 The only consolation for CSUN is that the utilities plant, because of its 
high-priority ranking, probably will be financed from Cal State funds in 
1995-96, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many other projects at other campuses face less certain futures, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bond setbacks erased $131 million of the Cal State system's $143-million 
capital-projects budget for the current year, and a similar amount for 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
 Only $12 million of separately funded projects will proceed this year, 
including $3.6 million of equipment for an addition to CSUN's engineering 
building. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said CSUN's central utilities system, particularly its steam boilers 
and heating system, was old and in need of replacement even before the January 
earthquake rocked the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 If the current plant were to fail, it could jeopardize the school's operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next two years, Cal State officials had expected to spend about $260 
million of Proposition 1C funds on various projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the system hopes to recoup only about $100 million of that for 1995-96 by 
seeking state approval to fund that smaller amount from its own budget. JOHN 
CHANDLER

JUSTICE DEPT. CONSIDERS MONITORING 69TH DISTRICT; POLITICS: LATINO GROUP 
REQUESTS ACTION AFTER GOP ASSEMBLYMAN ANNOUNCED PLANS TO PUT VOLUNTEER POLL 
WATCHERS AT 21 PRECINCTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES POLITICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acting on a request from a Latino voting rights group, the U.S. Justice 
Department said Wednesday it is considering whether to monitor precincts in the 
69th Assembly District on Election Day to ensure voters are not being 
intimidated by partisan poll watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The local office of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund 
asked for the federal monitors after Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Garden Grove) 
said he planned to have volunteer poll watchers at 21 precincts in the 69th 
District, where he and other Republicans believe Democrats have engaged in 
voter fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats and Latino political activists have expressed outrage over Conroy's 
plan, calling it a repeat of a 1988 incident in which the county GOP posted 
uniformed security guards at Latino precincts in what is now the 69th District. 
</P>
<P>
 John Tanner, a spokesman for the Justice Department's civil rights division, 
said his office would not decide until just before the election whether to seek 
a court order approving federal monitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, we have received a call about it and are trying to get 
information," he said. "What we do next is impossible to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Although their participation has been requested in the past, federal officials 
have never officially monitored an election in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, who heads the local MALDEF office, said that in addition to 
requesting the Justice Department's monitoring of the Nov. 8 election, MALDEF 
is also seeking a federal review of what Conroy intends to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Palacio said he will meet with county election officials today to learn the 
ground rules for poll watching so that his own group of volunteer attorneys can 
address any issues that may arise on Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Conroy insisted Wednesday that his volunteers would not directly 
question voters or interfere in the voting process, but would check the list of 
those who had voted against their own list of names that they believe are bogus 
registrations. He vowed this would not be a repeat of the 1988 poll guard 
incident that resulted in the GOP paying a $400,000 out-of-court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tell (the Democrats), 'Don't waste their money with the Justice Department.' 
You only learn your lessons one time," Conroy said. "We will do a close 
scrutiny of the voters in the 69th District. That's my promise." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Conroy and 10 local GOP legislators sent a letter to county 
Registrar of Voters Donald Tanney, asking that he purge the voter rolls in the 
69th District because of what they called suspected voter fraud by the 
Democrats. Tanney, who is still conducting his review, said earlier this week 
that a preliminary check of names submitted by the Republicans showed that no 
one had ever attempted to vote twice. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, Conroy sent another letter to Tanney, suggesting that he "red 
tag" voters with multiple registrations if they have the same birth date and 
the same residence; voters with similar spellings of first or last names; and 
voters with identical names and birth dates but with different addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Conroy's office also released the voter registration stubs of an Anaheim 
couple who claimed that earlier this year they were signed up to vote in front 
of an Anaheim grocery store but that their registration cards were never 
submitted to the county because they declined to state their political party. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Conroy cannot prove who was to blame for the registration cards not 
being turned into the county, his aide, Jim Bieber, said he had reason to 
believe the couple's voter registration was not handled by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as Conroy stood by his belief that the polls in the 69th District need to 
be monitored by GOP volunteers, some of his fellow Republicans cautioned that 
the plan could backfire if it is misinterpreted as an attempt to intimidate 
Latino voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of the political setback suffered by the GOP after the 1988 election, 
Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach) said the idea of poll monitors may 
be touching an "exposed political nerve." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because it was handled badly the first time, it is now an exposed political 
nerve that should not be revisited," Ferguson said. "There are other ways to 
ensure the integrity of the ballot without putting a sharp stick into the 
exposed nerve." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Curt Pringle (R-Garden Grove), who won the 1988 election in the 
district where the poll guards were posted, tried to distance himself from 
Conroy's plan. He said he had not discussed the proposal with Conroy, but added 
that it did not sound like anything out of the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Pringle and other Republicans said both political parties routinely watch to 
see who has voted on Election Day to monitor the progress of their 
get-out-the-vote campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am touching a sensitive nerve," Conroy admitted. "I understand the 
difference between obstructing people (attempting to vote) and going in and 
making sure that the election is legal and fair. That's a whole different 
ballgame, and nothing in the world can stop me from doing that." 
</P>
<P>
 Bieber, Conroy's aide, emphasized there would be no attempt to intimidate 
voters. "If the poll guards (incident) had never happened, nobody would be 
batting an eye at this suggestion," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Democrats are outraged. In the 46th Congressional District, which overlaps 
with the 69th Assembly District, a spokesman for Democratic nominee Mike Farber 
said the campaign would legally challenge any attempt by Republicans to have 
poll watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Prince, Farber's campaign spokesman, said Democrats do not believe 
Conroy's assurances that voters in the Latino precincts would not be 
intimidated. "Why aren't they putting (poll watchers) in Newport Beach? Why are 
they putting them in minority areas? That's intimidation," he said.

GOP STARS GIVE BOOST TO SYBERT'S CAMPAIGN; POLITICS: JACK KEMP AND WILLIAM 
BENNETT SPEAK AT FUND-RAISER FOR CHALLENGER FACING REP. ANTHONY C. BEILENSON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican congressional challenger Richard Sybert got a helping hand from GOP 
heavyweights Jack Kemp and William Bennett on Wednesday at a fund-raiser that 
grossed $75,000 for Sybert's campaign against Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp and Bennett, both leading lights of the GOP's right wing and possible 
1996 presidential candidates, praised Sybert and attacked Beilenson, President 
Clinton and the Democrat-controlled Congress before about 300 Sybert boosters 
at the Warner Center Hilton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert, a Woodland Hills attorney and former state planning chief under Gov. 
Pete Wilson, is running hard against Beilenson, who is seeking to hold onto his 
seat representing the 24th Congressional District, which stretches from Sherman 
Oaks to Newbury Park in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing against Beilenson," Kemp said. "My wife and I know him and his 
wife. We have nothing against Democrats. They're needed on this Earth. They're 
here to redistribute wealth. That's OK, as long there's someone who understands 
how to create it. And Rich does." 
</P>
<P>
 The $150-a-head fund-raiser helped Sybert, 42, top up his campaign war chest 
as his race against Beilenson enters the final seven weeks. According to the 
most recent campaign reports, released in late July, the two men had roughly 
the same amount of cash on hand, with Beilenson reporting $135,852 and Sybert 
$122,759. 
</P>
<P>
 During the first six months of this year, Sybert relied heavily on his own 
wealth to finance his campaign. Reports show he raised $90,871 from outside 
sources but lent his campaign committee $421,685. In addition to Wednesday's 
fund-raiser, Sybert has scheduled an Oct. 1 event featuring House Minority Whip 
Newt Gingrich, another conservative favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp, former secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development and 
pro football quarterback, praised Sybert as a candidate who "understands 
private property (and) limited government." Kemp also predicted that if 
elected, Sybert would not fall into the trap of excessive partisanship that 
some observers claim has paralyzed the current Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's going to represent this district and Buffalo, N. Y., and Motown and 
Chi-town and East Harlem because he understands that this is a country that 
cries out for equal opportunity," Kemp said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Bennett barely mentioned Sybert in his speech. The former federal 
drug czar and secretary of the Department of Education instead attacked the 
"religion of governmentalism," which he said is contributing to the decline of 
morality and family values. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Asked after their speeches if they had met Sybert before Wednesday, both 
Bennett and Kemp said no. But it is common for politicians seeking national 
office to endorse local candidates with similar values in hopes of tapping into 
greater grass-roots support. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a progressive, conservative, bleeding-heart, Abraham Lincoln Republican 
who understands what it's going to take to get California back on the growth 
path," Kemp said of Sybert. Kemp added that he and Bennett plan to make 
appearances on behalf of two other GOP congressional candidates in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Also this week, a spokesman for the Republican National Congressional 
Committee, which aids GOP congressional candidates, said the committee won't 
decide until late this month or early October whether to commit money or other 
resources to Sybert's campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Leonard said the 24th District is one of five to seven congressional seats 
in California where national GOP strategists feel Democratic incumbents are 
vulnerable. The RNCC is "very optimistic" that Sybert can topple Beilenson, 
Leonard said.  
</P>
<P>
 If it decides to back Sybert, the RNCC can contribute up to $5,000 in cash and 
$58,600 in non-monetary help, such as TV ads and postage, to his campaign. 
Leonard said Sybert already has met with the committee's chairman, Rep. Bill 
Paxon of New York.

COMEDIAN PLEADS NO CONTEST IN FIRE; COURT: BOBCAT GOLDTHWAIT IS FINED $3,880 
AND ORDERED TO PROMOTE BURN CENTER AFTER SETTING CHAIR ABLAZE ON 'THE TONIGHT 
SHOW.' 
</P>

<P>
 Stand-up comedian Bobcat Goldthwait pleaded no contest Wednesday to setting 
his chair on fire during the May 6 taping of "The Tonight Show With Jay Leno" 
and was fined $3,888 and ordered to tape public-service announcements to 
promote a Canoga Park burn center. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York-born entertainer made a personal appearance Wednesday at the 
Burbank courthouse, where he was ordered to pay a $2,700 fine and assessment, 
$698 to NBC for the damaged chair and almost $500 to the city of Burbank for 
investigating the incident, said Deputy City Atty. Robert Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait was also placed on three years informal probation and required to 
tape public-service announcements to promote the Alisa Ann Ruch Burn Foundation 
in Canoga Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the 15- and 30-second messages have already been taped, and were 
handed to Walters Wednesday for distribution to television stations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think there was maliciousness here," Walters said of the misdemeanor 
charge. "It was reckless. It was a joke gone bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait is believed to be the first guest of "The Tonight Show" to be 
charged with a crime, according to NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 The comedian used lighter fluid and a long-handled lighter to set his chair on 
fire as host Jay Leno and another guest, actress-model Lauren Hutton, looked 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 Leno and Hutton quickly doused the fire with cups of water, but Burbank fire 
officials worried that the flame could have quickly spread. The incident aired 
that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldthwait plead no contest to a charge of recklessly causing a fire, Walters 
said. A second misdemeanor charge of possessing a flammable substance with the 
intent to burn was dismissed by the Municipal Court commissioner who heard the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Under informal probation, Walters said, Goldthwait is not required to visit 
regularly with a probation officer. But if he gets in trouble with the law 
again, he may receive stiffer penalties for violating probation, Walters said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased," said Karen Brodkin, an attorney for Goldthwait. "We'd like to 
get everything behind us."

JURY TO BE SELECTED IN MURDER CASE; COURTS: MARK SCOTT THORNTON IS ACCUSED OF 
KILLING NURSE KELLIE O'SULLIVAN. PANEL WON'T HEAR OF SEARCH FOR HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Exactly one year after Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan was abducted and 
slain, a Ventura County judge on Wednesday wrapped up the final pretrial 
hearing in the murder case against her accused killer and ordered jury 
selection to begin Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Before commencing Wednesday's evidentiary hearing in the case against 
20-year-old Mark Scott Thornton, Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath issued 
a ruling that prevents prosecutors from telling the jury that O'Sullivan's 
badly decomposed body was found after a massive search. 
</P>
<P>
 During the search, as many as 275 civilian volunteers and 35 Ventura County 
Sheriff's Department personnel spread out over 170 square miles of rugged 
countryside around Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In another ruling Wednesday, the judge gave prosecutors permission to allow 
one of Thornton's ex-girlfriends to testify against him. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, identified in court only as "Erika," will tell the jury how the 
defendant once took her to the Santa Monica Mountains and bragged of a place 
that "I can take you that people will never find you again," according to 
prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors believe that statement is significant because O'Sullivan's body 
was discovered in a brush-choked region of the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton's attorneys criticized the judge after the hearing, saying McGrath 
should not have allowed the ex-girlfriend's statement into evidence. Deputy 
Public Defender Susan R. Olson said that after the alleged incident, Thornton 
immediately drove the girl home. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence regarding the year-old incident with Erika should not have been 
allowed," Olson said. "I don't think it's relevant. It's a situation where she 
requested to go home, (and) she was taken home. It was not a kidnaping. And so 
I don't see how it would be relevant to this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers from both sides met privately with McGrath in his chambers after the 
hearing to hash out the final details of jury selection, which is expected to 
last about four weeks. Lawyers are hoping to select 12 regular jurors and four 
alternates from a panel of 275 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Police say Thornton kidnaped O'Sullivan around 2 in the afternoon of Sept. 14, 
1993, and shot her three times -- twice in the back and once in the chest. 
</P>
<P>
 He then drove off in her 1991 Ford Explorer, they say. Eight hours after she 
was last seen, Thornton arrived at the house of another ex-girlfriend, 
Stephanie Campbell, authorities say. 
</P>
<P>
 He kidnaped Campbell, shot at her mother and drove to Reno, where he was 
arrested five days later at the Circus Circus Hotel and Casino, authorities 
say. Six days after that, two civilians participating in the massive 
land-and-air search found O'Sullivan's decomposed body. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors believe information on the search would show the jury that 
Thornton wanted O'Sullivan out of the way so that no one would notice that her 
truck was missing. That way, the defendant would have time to kidnap Campbell 
in the truck before police started looking for the vehicle, Deputy Dist. Atty. 
Peter D. Kossoris told the judge. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "He didn't want the theft of the vehicle reported. He needed some time," 
Kossoris said. ". . . . He didn't want her found or it known that she was 
kidnaped or shot to death." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Public Defender Howard J. Asher suggested that no one made an 
attempt to hide O'Sullivan's body. He noted, for example, that her body was not 
buried or camouflaged in any way. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath sided with defense attorneys on the issue. He said information on the 
search appears to have no relevance to issues of guilt or innocence in the 
case.

TRIAL BEGINS IN FATAL CRASH OF HELICOPTER; COURTS: VICTIM'S FAMILY CLAIMS 
MANUFACTURER WAS NEGLIGENT. PROMINENT SURGEON WAS KILLED WHEN HIS FUEL WAS CUT 
OFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 What caused a helicopter piloted by a prominent Orange County surgeon to crash 
two years ago is the question confronting jurors in a trial that began 
Wednesday in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Todd L. Passoff died in the crash shortly after lifting off from an 
Anaheim hospital. His family has sued Robinson Helicopter Co., the 
Torrance-based manufacturer of the helicopter that the orthopedic surgeon was 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Austero, the lawyer for Passoff's wife, Elyse, said he will seek to 
prove that Passoff inadvertently operated a lever shutting off the fuel to the 
helicopter's engine, which then stalled in flight, because the lever was placed 
dangerously close to other levers that are needed to fly the aircraft. The 
attorney also contended that the safety guard was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But lawyers for the company blamed pilot error for the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 "As great a surgeon as he was and as great a human being, he was just an 
average pilot," the defense attorney, Allen L. Neelley, told the jury in his 
opening remarks. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred May 8, 1992, just after Passoff left Anaheim Memorial 
Medical Center, where he had completed a knee joint replacement, en route to a 
sports medicine clinic he operated in Temecula. Passoff lived in Newport Beach 
with his wife and two young daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Neelley also said that in the last months before the accident Passoff did not 
fly the R-22 helicopter frequently enough to maintain proficiency and that he 
failed to obtain refresher training in executing emergency landings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Neelley said in an interview outside the courtroom that just two days before 
the crash the 43-year-old surgeon had been advised by the chief pilot and 
president of Helistream Inc. -- the Costa Mesa company that taught him to fly 
the $115,000 helicopter and serviced it -- that he needed to bring his 
emergency training up to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Neelley said he will attempt to show that Passoff may have been especially 
nervous or hurried that morning because he was flying without first obtaining 
required clearance from the nearby Fullerton Airport control tower and was at 
an altitude between 150 and 200 feet, lower than the minimum 500 feet that 
Neeley said is recommended to allow enough room to land safely in an emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal safety officials who investigated the crash of the helicopter, which 
plunged into a sand and gravel operation a mile from Anaheim Memorial, said at 
the time that the pilot had failed to auto-rotate the chopper blades when the 
power quit. Auto-rotation is an emergency procedure in which the pilot 
disengages the main rotor blades from the engine. This helps the blades rotate 
on their own as the aircraft descends, greatly reducing the speed of the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The first witness called by the Passoff family's attorney was Jerry Wells, an 
expert at investigating plane crashes. He testified that the helicopter would 
have been safer if the fuel mixture control lever, which regulates the flow of 
fuel from the carburetor to the engine, had been placed in a more remote 
location in the cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wells said there was no need for the fuel mixture control to be within easy 
reach of the pilot because the helicopter's operating manual recommends against 
adjusting it in flight: "Its only function is to shut off the engine."  
</P>
<P>
 During an investigation of the wreckage, Wells said, he found evidence that 
the pilot indeed had operated the lever that caused the accident. He said the 
carburetor was on idle. 
</P>
<P>
 Neelley, however, said he knew of no other accidents caused by pilot errors in 
activating the fuel control on the R-22, which he described as "the largest 
selling light helicopter in the world," with about 2,500 aircraft sold since it 
was certified by the Federal Aviation Administration in 1979. Neelley said that 
when the wife of a pilot accidentally pulled the fuel mixture control gear in 
1981, the company installed a guard on it to prevent such mishaps. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wells testified that because the guard is removable it can be easily 
misplaced or forgotten.

RIDES TURN COMMUNITY ON FOR SIMI VALLEY DAYS; FESTIVALS: CARNIVAL IS THE 
CENTERPIECE OF ANNUAL CELEBRATION AND FUND-RAISER THAT SUPPORTS LOCAL 
CHARITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Greased and ready to roll, the Mega Loop hurtled screaming patrons upside down 
and around a looping track for its first run at the start of the Simi Valley 
Days carnival. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnies rushed to put together the Mega Loop along with the 23 other rides and 
dozens of other attractions before the five-day carnival opened Wednesday at 5 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 With bolts all tightened and rides checked by a state inspector, everything 
was ready to go when the fun-hungry dashed to be first on the rides. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers are predicting that, because students in Simi Valley are off for 
the Jewish holiday Yom Kippur today, the turnout at the carnival will be 
greater than normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least that's what we're hoping," said organizer JoAnne Macek, who spent 
much of Wednesday doing last-minute carnival preparations. 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival has become the centerpiece of the annual Simi Valley Days 
celebration, which has been held in different forms since 1962. It is the 
largest public event in the city, bringing in as much as $70,000 for local 
charities, Macek said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year more than 25,000 people came to the carnival over five days, she 
said. This year she expects at least as many. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what would keep them away," she said. "We've got lovely weather 
and something special going on every night." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a reduced entrance fee of $3 tonight, carnival organizers are 
offering patrons a chance to "let a friend fly free," allowing one customer to 
ride an attraction free when a partner pays for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Saturday and Sunday admissions will be $5. 
</P>
<P>
 "For five bucks they'll also get into the rodeo dance on Friday," she said. 
"And on Saturday and Sunday for the price of admission, you'll get to see the 
rodeo as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Live performances are scheduled for every night of the carnival, and a stage 
and temporary dance floor have been set up. 
</P>
<P>
 Wes Miller, the Simi Valley Days committee's chairman, worked for several 
hours on Wednesday, putting the finishing touches on the plywood floor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be that we had'em dancing in the dirt," Miller said,while applying 
a thin layer of waterproof coating. "Now they've got a floor and room to 
rumba." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the biggest fund-raising event we have all year," said Cindy Shuman of 
Telephone Pioneers, a charity group made up of Pacific Bell workers.  
</P>
<P>
 While setting up the telephone group's concession stand, Shuman said her 
organization has raised several thousand dollars each year at the carnival. The 
money is used for programs to feed the homeless, help handicapped students and 
support local anti-crime organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Telephone Pioneers sell tri-tip sandwiches and sodas along a row of a 
dozen other food booths for charities.  
</P>
<P>
 The event has almost as much importance for the carnies, said Tony Tafton, who 
manages crews that run the carnival rides and non-charity concessions. Tafton 
said that over the last five years, Simi Valley Days has become the carnival 
company's second-biggest stop. The top-grossing carnival is Conejo Valley Days 
in Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Tafton said the events are similar but each has its own character. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every event people seem to enjoy a different ride," Tafton said. "One place 
it's the Mega Loop, the next it might be the Tilt O' Whirl."

ACTION MAY BE BAD SIGN FOR JANSS MALL PROJECT; THOUSAND OAKS: DENIAL OF REQUEST 
BY TOYS R US FOR MORE SIGNAGE AT GATEWAY COULD JEOPARDIZE PLANNED RENOVATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Recoiling from a request some characterized as blackmail, Thousand Oaks 
council members have decided that Toys R Us cannot tack its name onto a 
tile-and-stone wall planned as a flashy new gateway to the Janss Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 But that decision could jeopardize the mall's $55-million renovation, as Toys 
R Us representatives have threatened to block the entire project unless they 
can erect more signs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Toys R Us lease grants the store the power to veto any major change in the 
Janss Mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will exercise its clout, attorney Richard Greenberg said, "unless 
sufficient steps are taken to ensure that our store is not adversely affected." 
Among Toys R Us key demands: "A significant increase in signage." 
</P>
<P>
 Calling that bluff, council members Tuesday refused to add the Toys R Us name 
to the 84-foot-long wall that will stand at Moorpark Road and Hillcrest Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed, on a 3-2 vote, that the Mervyn's name could adorn one wing 
of the wall. The discount department store had first applied for that privilege 
last spring, only to be blocked by a tie vote when Mayor Alex Fiore was absent 
from the public hearing. With Fiore presiding, the council majority approved 
the sign Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the council members accused Toys R Us of piggy-backing onto Mervyn's 
proposal at the eleventh hour, hoping to squeeze a concession from the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having been given an inch, businesses are coming back and asking for a foot 
or a foot-and-a-half," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "I don't like the word 
blackmail . . . but I'm very uncomfortable at this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Fiore, who supported the signs, said he considered the heavy pressure 
"some form of blackmail." 
</P>
<P>
 Toys R Us attorney Greenberg bristled at any hint of coercion, saying, "It's 
completely inaccurate to call this blackmail."  
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the terminology, the tactic backfired. 
</P>
<P>
 The council granted Toys R Us only one concession: the store will be allowed 
to use larger letters in its exterior wall sign. Fiore also suggested that Toys 
R Us can return to the council once the entryway sign is installed and request 
a modification. 
</P>
<P>
 Toys R Us attorneys refused to speculate on whether the exterior sign will be 
enough to boost the store's visibility. In interviews Wednesday, they continued 
to take a hard line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than just a question of whether we can have the sign," said Michael 
Tumolo, a vice president and real estate counsel for Toys R Us. "There are many 
issues. (But) what we've said is, we would be willing to consider approving the 
redevelopment if we could get the sign." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the sign issue, Toys R Us has concerns about proposed alterations 
in the Janss Mall parking lot. And the company opposes any construction that 
would affect the store during the crucial pre-Christmas sales period of October 
through December, Tumolo said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The public hearing Tuesday night brought out two of the 14 challengers running 
for council seats, who landed on opposite sides of the sign debate. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Michael Markey urged approval of the signs, arguing that they would 
would attract customers -- and their sales tax dollars -- to Thousand Oaks. 
"They've done whatever they can to make it look aesthetically pleasing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposing him, candidate Lee Laxdal expressed frustration that Toys R Us had 
"jumped on board" to clamor for a sign such as Mervyn's. Sign requests had 
proliferated like rabbits, he said. Laxdal asked the council to send the entire 
matter to the Planning Commission for review.

MAN WHO OFFERED BRIBE TO IRS AGENT GETS PRISON SENTENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A La Habra businessman convicted of bribing an agent of the Internal Revenue 
Service was sentenced this week to 27 months in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 David Chiang, 41, was found guilty of offering the agent $10,000 in cash if 
she would eliminate $124,000 in taxes, penalties and interest that he failed to 
pay to the IRS on money he withheld from his employees' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiang was the owner and president of East Hill Management Corp., which ran 
two Arby's restaurants -- one in La Habra and one in Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he promised to pay the back taxes for three years, he never did so, 
federal authorities found. When agent Mary Kay Pittner told him she planned to 
obtain a court order to shut down his two fast-food restaurants, he made the 
bribe offer, according to the IRS. 
</P>
<P>
 Chiang was arrested in April, and the IRS seized his business assets.

 The number of paroled convicts visiting a controversial parole office in 
Sherman Oaks has been reduced by 70%, but lawmakers and an influential 
homeowners group vowed to continue protesting until all are sent elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Parole officials pointed to the trend Wednesday as proof of their intention to 
eventually keep a promise made by state Department of Corrections chief James 
Gomez to close the office. But they also acknowledged that because of problems 
they have encountered in finding new office space, they cannot say when the 
promise will be kept. 
</P>
<P>
 An average of 12 ex-convicts now appear every day at the office at 5121 Van 
Nuys Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Before drug and psychiatric programs were removed at Gomez's order, parole 
officers were seeing 35 to 40 parolees a day.  
</P>
<P>
 The fact that convicted criminals are still coming a month after Gomez 
promised to have them directed elsewhere has renewed calls for the office to be 
moved out of Sherman Oaks. Five parole units, each of which has seven to eight 
parole officers who usually meet their clients off-site, continue to operate 
out of the site.  
</P>
<P>
 The complete move out of Sherman Oaks may now be years away, according to 
Frank Marino, head of the controversial office, which opened earlier this year 
across the street from a public park and near a residential neighborhood.  
</P>
<P>
 "It (the move) could take months, it could take years," said Marino. 
</P>
<P>
 Corrections spokesman Tip Kendel said that because parolee visits have been 
eliminated except for emergency drop-ins, the promise has been kept. 
</P>
<P>
 When the office opened on April 25, hundreds of paroled felons each month 
reported there, and neighbors and legislators loudly protested. Gomez pledged 
at a public meeting in May to move the office by Aug. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 The Corrections Department planned to move back to the building it had 
occupied in North Hollywood, near the corner of Laurel Canyon Boulevard and 
Vanowen Street. But negotiations with the owner, who has quoted prices that 
Marino termed "unacceptable," have yet to be concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 And residents who lived near the North Hollywood site for years without 
protest began a campaign of their own aimed at blocking its return, triggering 
a dispute between powerful politicians and influential residents' 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Political and community leaders Wednesday vowed to fight to make sure 
Corrections moves the entire office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make sure it moves," said Sandy Miller, chief of staff for 
state Sen. David Roberti (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 "Sen. Roberti is adamant about the Sherman Oaks parole office relocating due 
to the fact that it is directly across from a park, and it is not a safe 
environment."  
</P>
<P>
 Roberti and others have maintained that the Van Nuys Boulevard location 
violated the Corrections Department's own guidelines for siting parole offices 
at least a quarter-mile from parks and schools.  
</P>
<P>
 "They have made a commitment to the public to get out of that location, and 
that remains our expectation," said Alisa Katz, chief of staff for City 
Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., said that he 
did not think the department had changed its mind about the move, but that it 
had run into delays.  
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of the move to Sherman Oaks, the Corrections Department closed 
its Van Nuys office and crowded 65 employees into the 10,000-square-foot North 
Hollywood office. Employees can't move back to North Hollywood without some 
extra elbow room, Marino said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't possibly move all the people back into that one location," he 
said. When Roberti and other politicians succeeded in getting the Corrections 
Department to agree to move the parole office in May, Van Nuys and Hollywood 
residents -- who have had parole offices in their communities for years -- 
complained that Sherman Oaks was getting favored treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 After the brouhaha, Roberti helped establish a citizens committee to research 
an appropriate site for the parole office. According to committee member Don 
Schultz, most members were from Van Nuys and North Hollywood, and they found 
that the Sherman Oaks site was the best location for the parole office. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The committee's decision) was well thought out and based on knowledge and 
meeting with parole officials," Schultz said. "There is no need to move it 
other than that certain people in Sherman Oaks don't want it there."  
</P>
<P>
 State Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) also opposes the move. Katz said he 
has written Corrections Department officials, but said he did not think his 
letter contributed to the delay. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have heard that there are problems with the ownership of the (North 
Hollywood) site, that there are asbestos problems and parking problems," Katz 
said. "I am not at all surprised that they are having trouble. They should stop 
playing games and stay in Sherman Oaks where (the department's) study said they 
should be, and be done with it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Sherman Oaks office keeps tabs on 4,100 convicted criminals. The state had 
signed a five- to 10-year, $2.5-million lease for the Sherman Oaks site.

CONCERN RAISED PLAZA'S COPPER CURTAIN MAY NOT ALWAYS SPARKLE; THOUSAND OAKS: 
THE OUTDOOR STRIPS WILL EVENTUALLY AGE AND TURN GREEN, UNLESS, SOME SAY, 
SEALANTS ARE APPLIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's not easy being green. Not if you're a copper curtain cascading down the 
eastern wall of Thousand Oaks' Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the copper curtain isn't green -- not yet. It's still shimmering 
with new-penny sheen. But like most copper, the 2,016 skinny strips will 
eventually turn green. And Councilwoman Judy Lazar worries about that. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will lose that ability to reflect light," she said. "Especially at night, 
it's really spectacular." 
</P>
<P>
 Although project manager Ed Johnduff believes the curtain's tawny complexion 
will last a good two decades, Lazar asked city staff members Tuesday to search 
for sealants that could be applied now to preserve the coppery glint. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Councilwoman Elois Zeanah objected, arguing that a protective coating 
would amount to "another unplanned expense" and would bump up the cost of the 
$150,000 curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life is made up of unplanned events," Lazar responded. "If we don't inform 
ourselves about our options, we won't be able to avail ourselves of them." 
</P>
<P>
 To some artists, that would be just as well. 
</P>
<P>
 They would love the curtain to turn green, to echo the zebra-striped green 
glass wall near the council chamber and the tumble of green plants that will 
soon adorn the outdoor plazas. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would give a lot of character to the building," said Howard Leong, a local 
jeweler and arts commissioner. "Now it just looks . . . brownish.' 
</P>
<P>
 When architect Antoine Predock designed the one-of-a-kind curtain, he also 
envisioned the copper fading over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Predock, who won the architectural contract by promising that his design would 
express the spirit of the Conejo Valley, believes the Civic Arts Plaza should 
reflect the past and future of Thousand Oaks. How better to carry out that 
philosophy, he said, than to allow the environment to shape the copper curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, whatever patina evolves in that climate is how it's supposed to be," 
Predock said. "As far as I'm concerned, it should be allowed to weather 
naturally. I think it'll still shimmer -- it doesn't have to be shiny-penny new 
to catch the light." 
</P>
<P>
 No council member has yet committed to preserving the copper curtain's shine 
with sealant. And indeed, the logistics and price may prove daunting. 
</P>
<P>
 An early plan to tint the copper panels with blotches of dark green, purple 
and blue flopped when every batch of dye turned the strips a garish turquoise, 
project manager Johnduff said. He noted that council members had initially 
asked for a multihued patina -- and now they're considering a sealant that 
would prevent those green-blue colors from emerging. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put it up raw, and when we unveiled it everyone goes, 'Oh, that's great, 
the copper is a really neat color,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the two-year Civic Arts Plaza construction project enters its final month, 
council members and residents have started suggesting many small changes to 
improve the complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the curtain sealant, for instance, Councilwoman Lazar has said she 
would like to investigate how to spruce up the unfinished concrete walls on the 
first floor of the City Hall building. And many residents have urged the city 
to paint the industrial gray parking garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Staff will look into all such concerns and bring back a list of options for 
council consideration, City Manager Grant Brimhall said. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the man in charge of bringing in the project on time and under budget, 
Johnduff worries about the flurry of last-minute tinkering. 
</P>
<P>
 The contingency fund, which once topped $3.5 million, has been tapped by 
various add-on purchases, and Johnduff said he is not sure how much cushion 
remains. He won't know the final balance, he said, until all the bills are 
paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you throw a lot of things at the job at the very end, even though they 
might be small costs . . . you're putting yourself in trouble," Johnduff 
warned. "It's not smart fiscal policy."

YOUTHS ROB UPS DRIVER, TAKE PACKAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four men robbed a United Parcel Service driver at gunpoint and ransacked the 
truck searching for computer equipment Wednesday, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 After making a delivery on Goodyear street at 4:05 p.m., the driver was forced 
into the back of his truck and tied up by three robbers carrying handguns, 
according to Sgt. Jeff Kermode of the Irvine Police Department.They drove the 
van about a mile away to 7 Morgan street, while a fourth youth followed in a 
black BMW, Kermode said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robbers rifled through the UPS packages, apparently looking for computer 
equipment, Kermode said. Unable to find any computer goods, they took the 
driver's wallet and an unspecified number of packages. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses told police they saw the men, described as Asians in their early 
20s, loading packages into a maroon full-size Chevrolet pickup with a camper 
shell. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, who sustained minor injuries during the robbery, called police 
from a nearby business, Kermode said. 
</P>
<P>
 No arrests have been made in the case, Kermode said. Police are continuing the 
investigation.

CITY REJECTS OFFER TO SETTLE SCHOOLS' WARNER CENTER SUIT; DEVELOPMENT: THE 
DISTRICT REQUESTED $5 MILLION TO COMPENSATE FOR THE NOISE AND TRAFFIC LIKELY TO 
BE GENERATED BY THE PROPOSED EXPANSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Meeting behind closed doors, the Los Angeles City Council rejected an offer 
Wednesday to settle a school district lawsuit over a proposed expansion of the 
Warner Center development in Woodland Hills, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed by the Los Angeles Unified School District in July, contends 
that the city approved an expansion plan for the center without adequately 
considering how extra noise and traffic might affect students at nearby 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 In its settlement offer, the district asked for more than $5 million to 
install air conditioners at Parkman Middle School and Canoga Park High School 
so students can shut the windows to keep out noise and dust, according to City 
Hall sources. 
</P>
<P>
 The council rejected the offer and instructed its attorneys to return to the 
bargaining table. But, Councilwoman Laura Chick, who represents the Warner 
Center area, does not foresee an out-of-court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I'm not optimistic because the message I'm getting from LAUSD is that 
they are not going to be flexible," she said after the closed-door meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Chick said she urged the council not to agree to a cash settlement. Instead, 
the council should offer to help the district get money for the air 
conditioners from state school officials in Sacramento, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have one part of the city's family slugging it out in court with another 
part is a sorry state," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district is willing to continue settlement discussions, said Brad 
Hogin, a private attorney hired by the district to handle the suit. But he said 
the district will not back down on getting the air conditioners. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the increased traffic from the proposed expansion is "like putting a 
freeway next to the schools" and "the school district wants to ensure that the 
schools are protected." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The result of nearly eight years of study and negotiation, the guide to 
development and traffic improvements at Warner Center was approved by the City 
Council in June. It permits 35.7 million square feet of development in the 
1,100-acre center near Topanga Canyon Boulevard and the Ventura Freeway. The 
total includes 15 million square feet already built. 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Mark Slavkin said the city should pay for the air 
conditioners from fees that are required of Warner Center developers to reduce 
traffic problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ball is in their court," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district's lawsuit is not without precedent. Last year the district 
sued Burbank Airport, claiming a proposed expansion of the terminal would 
increase noise at adjacent schools. The airport settled the lawsuit by agreeing 
to pay $500,000 and seek $2 million in federal grants to soundproof and install 
air conditioning at two nearby schools.

JUDGE DECLARES MISTRIAL IN MILBURN MURDER CASE; COURTS: JURORS DEADLOCK AFTER 
DELIBERATING A MONTH. MARTIAL ARTS EXPERT FACES A SECOND TRIAL IN THE SLAYING 
OF HIS COLLEAGUE VERONICA ESTRADA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 The murder trial of a martial arts expert accused of strangling another 
instructor out of professional jealousy ended in a mistrial Wednesday, with the 
jury leaning toward a conviction but unable to reach a unanimous verdict after 
a month of deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 A new trial was automatically ordered for Stuart Edward Milburn, 27, who 
remained in custody without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn was charged with murdering Veronica Estrada, 29, as she walked to her 
Canyon Country home along a dark road last December. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Superior Court jury declared Wednesday that it had voted 8-4 
earlier in the day to convict Milburn of murder, but had given up hope of 
reaching a unanimous decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury acquitted him of a second charge of forcible sodomy. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert Foltz contended during the two-week trial that 
Milburn killed Estrada out of professional jealousy over her achievements. She 
was the American Taekwondo Assn.'s top-ranked female competitor in the 
second-level black belt division and had been named instructor of the year at 
Taekwondo USA in Canyon Country, an honor Milburn indicated he felt he deserved 
instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn faced a charge of murder with a special circumstance -- the sodomy -- 
but Foltz did not request the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 The Milburn and Estrada families were both anguished by the jury's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious the jury did not listen to the evidence," said Milburn's father, 
Stuart H. Milburn. "They listened to the inflammatory oratory of the D.A., who 
misstated evidence." 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada's father, Robert, shook his head as the jurors announced they were 
deadlocked. Later, with tears in his eyes, he described Milburn as "so cold and 
sure of himself he could buffalo people who couldn't think for themselves."  
</P>
<P>
 In 19 days of deliberations spread over four weeks, jurors said their opinions 
shifted wildly, from a 6-6 deadlock to a 10-2 vote for murder conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 After nine days, the jurors told Judge Charles Horan they were deadlocked 7 to 
5, but the judge ordered them to continue deliberating. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got really tense after a while," said Jon Cindrich, 31, a South Bay 
resident who was the jury foreman. He said some jurors got so tired of the 
lengthy arguments they stopped taking part or paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
 Estrada's partially clothed body was discovered on Dec. 16 in the brush 
alongside Soledad Canyon Road. Police said she had been strangled and sexually 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Three witnesses said they saw a man -- whom they later identified in a photo 
lineup as Milburn -- near the murder scene at 8:15 p.m., about the time police 
believe Estrada was killed. In addition, Milburn's ex-girlfriend testified that 
in conversations with her, he changed his alibi for the night of the murder and 
that he knew details of the incident before police did. 
</P>
<P>
 Milburn's attorney, Darryl Mounger, tried to convince the jury that Estrada's 
boyfriend, Eddie Hockaday, had a stronger motive and the opportunity to kill 
her. Witnesses said the two argued shortly before she was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cindrich said he voted for acquittal because he considered the prosecution's 
case weak and a student at the tae kwon do studio testified she saw Milburn 
there about the time Estrada was killed. The prosecutor produced several other 
witnesses who said they did not see Milburn in the studio at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to have 100 people saying they're innocent," Cindrich said. 
"You only need one." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some jurors who voted to convict Milburn called the prosecution's case 
weak, saying the witness's accounts sounded unreliable and there was little 
other evidence placing him at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I voted guilty, but just barely," said Mark Gonzales, 37, an Inglewood 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ken Carver, 51, of San Gabriel, said he consistently voted to convict 
Milburn of murder because of his changing alibi, and apparent motive and 
opportunity. He said he dismissed Mounger's theory that Hockaday could have 
killed Estrada "pretty much from the get-go." 
</P>
<P>
 A second trial will be held unless a judge decides no future jury is likely to 
arrive at a verdict, a possibility Foltz called unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 A pretrial hearing is scheduled for Sept. 30.

WESTLAKE WATER SQUABBLE TARGETS GOLF COURSE; RECREATION: RESIDENTS SEEK CONTROL 
OF LAKE. THEY SAY PUMPING TO KEEP FAIRWAYS GREEN HAS LEFT BOATS HITTING BOTTOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Fueled by the ire of 300 residents, the management board of Westlake Lake has 
agreed to create a legal fund to try to wrestle control of the man-made lake's 
water supply from the golf course they say is draining it. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake Village Golf Course has pumped lake water to keep its links green for 
years, but this year, the Westlake Lake Management Assn. says, it has taken so 
much water from the lake that boats are hitting bottom and docks are sitting on 
dry land. 
</P>
<P>
 The golf course, owned by the PYJ Corp., was given legal title to two pumps 
and wells in August by a federal government agency distributing the property of 
a failed savings and loan. 
</P>
<P>
 But the 1,200 residents of the upscale, private neighborhood believed they 
bought into the water supply when they paid for their expensive homes. After 
all, they have been paying for repairs and maintenance on the pumping system 
from an assessment fund for 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 If the golf course took more water than homeowners would like -- as it has 
this summer, dropping levels 16 inches -- residents thought they had the power 
to turn the pumps off. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding out they have no legal right to do so has been a rude awakening. 
Outrage over the golf course's pumping brought residents in droves to a meeting 
Tuesday night at the Westlake Yacht Club.  
</P>
<P>
 They filled the room and overflowed onto balconies, decks and stood five deep 
outside the entrance to the yacht club. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer force of their numbers forced association President Ben Schulman, 
who had favored developing a shared-ownership contract with the golf course, to 
throw out the planned meeting agenda in favor of a four-hour comment period. 
</P>
<P>
 While some residents pressed angry faces against club windows and complained 
of the cold outside, their neighbors inside hurled accusations, tore the 
microphone from each other's hands on several occasions and proposed actions 
against the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turn the pumps off," said Ed Trent, adding that he would be happy to cause a 
public relations ruckus for the golf course by marching at its entrance with a 
picket sign. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Saul Nadel, who like many lake residents is an attorney, tried to 
shoot that idea down, proposing instead that they file for a restraining order 
to stop the golf course from pumping any more water. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't turn the water off, because all you're doing is inviting a big 
lawsuit," Nadel cautioned. 
</P>
<P>
 After residents had gone home, the nine-member executive board voted to 
establish the legal fund, then approved three other items. The board 
appropriated $49,500 in reserve funds for shoreline repair and $9,600 to run a 
new pipeline into the lake from the smaller of the two pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 Then over the objections of some members who believe the issue of pump 
ownership should be decided before any money is spent on repairs, the board 
voted to spend $25,000 to repair the smaller pump. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the golf course really owns them, should we continue to repair the pumps?" 
asked Crosby Fentress, chairman of the association's water management 
committee. "I'd rather spend the money drilling another well." 
</P>
<P>
 Schulman said he believed the board had made progress on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure of the crowd pushed them into action," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Schulman still faces a recall effort by residents angry with him for 
suggesting that residents sign a contract with the golf course, even though he 
has since decided against it. His term expires in four months, and he has no 
plans to run again, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I really don't think there is much danger of a recall," he said. "I've 
still got some friends left. If it does pass, fine. I'll have fun, relax, and 
let someone else knock their head against a wall."

MAN GOES TO JAIL FOR PLAYING GAMES WITH DISABILITY CLAIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 A Montebello man who was seeking disability insurance when he was videotaped 
playing a game of soccer was sentenced Wednesday to 120 days in Orange County 
jail for filing a fraudulent workers' compensation claim, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Guillermo Gonzalez Roman, 30, pleaded guilty earlier this summer to felony 
counts of grand theft and filing a false workers' compensation claim, Deputy 
Dist. Atty.Patti Nicholls said. In addition to the jail time, Roman was ordered 
to pay back the $10,300 he had collected through the claim and was put on three 
years' formal probation. 
</P>
<P>
 His sentencing Wednesday in Municipal Court in Newport Beach before Judge 
Craig Robison was the culmination of an investigation by the Orange County 
district attorney's office and American International Cos. of Costa Mesa, which 
paid the claim between July, 1992, and August, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman, while working at Tomco Auto Products in Los Angeles, alleged he had 
injured his back on July 24, 1992, while lifting a 50-pound basket of 
carburetors. He documented constant pain in his waist, hips and legs in making 
his request for a permanent disability award, Nicholls said. He was placed on 
restricted work duties at Tomco. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators, acting on a tip, later discovered that after his request for 
disability, Roman had played in several "highly aggressive" California Soccer 
League games, Nicholls said. A private investigator videotaped him playing 
soccer with no apparent discomfort. He was arrested in November, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The videotape was the key to winning a conviction in the case, Nicholls said. 
</P>
<P>
 "How often do you get them on videotape?" she asked. "There are so many that 
are hard to prove." 
</P>
<P>
 At his sentencing, Roman paid back $3,100. Of the $10,300 paid in his claim, 
he actually pocketed about $1,100, with the rest going toward medical expenses, 
Nicholls said.

WOMAN CRITICALLY HURT, DRIVER HELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Reseda woman was arrested on suspicion of hit-and-run driving after an 
accident Wednesday in which a Canoga Park woman was critically injured, Los 
Angeles police reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Ana Mercedes Villanueva, 35, of Canoga Park was listed in critical condition 
at Northridge Hospital Medical Center with head and facial injuries, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villanueva was driving north on Winnetka Avenue when a vehicle driven by 
Consuelo Morales, 37, of Reseda collided with Villanueva's car as Morales made 
a left turn, police said. Villanueva's car spun out of control and smashed into 
a traffic signal at Winnetka Avenue and Roscoe Boulevard, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales fled in her car but was later arrested at her brother's house nearby, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patrol officers happened to be in the area when they saw her vehicle drive 
up," said Los Angeles Police Sgt. Ben Lee. "As soon as she saw them, she ran 
inside the house, where she was arrested." 
</P>
<P>
 Morales, booked on suspicion of felony hit-and-run driving, was being held in 
lieu of $200,000 bail, police said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN IS SOUGHT IN JET SKI DEATH; TRAGEDY: 
ANOTHER RIDER LEFT THE SCENE OF THE HIT-AND-RUN ACCIDENT THAT OCCURRED AT THE 
LAKE OVER LABOR DAY WEEKEND. 
</P>

<P>
 A man who left the scene of a fatal hit-and-run jet-ski accident at Castaic 
Lake during Labor Day weekend is being sought for questioning by police, 
authorities said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend found the body of Louie Ronald Ellis, 51, of Glendora, floating in a 
portion of the lake reserved for jet skiers at about 10:15 a.m. on Sept. 
4.Investigators said the accident may have occurred up to half an hour before 
Ellis was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses said they saw a second jet skier leave the scene shortly 
after the time the accident is believed to have occurred, but investigators are 
not yet calling that man a suspect, said Deputy Gabe Ramirez of the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The extent of his involvement has not been determined," Ramirez said. 
"However, detectives are circulating the composite drawing of him because they 
want to speak with him." 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 to 50 other jet skiers were using the lake at the time, but none 
apparently saw the accident, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man is described as a white male of stocky build in his early 30s, about 
six feet tall, with dark, curly hair and a mustache, Ramirez said. Witnesses 
told homicide investigators the man was riding a green-and-white See-Doo brand 
jet ski, and left the beach area of the lake in a late-model, teal Chevrolet 
pickup truck with an extended cab. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident represents the first death at the lake this year and the third 
since the recreation area opened in 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about the accident or the man being sought is asked to 
call Michael Crowley or Henry Reed at the sheriff's homicide unit at (213) 
890-5500.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA JOINS VIDEO GENERATION AT 
COUNCIL MEETINGS; GOVERNMENT: CITY STARTS BROADCASTS OF TAPED SESSIONS TO BE 
SHOWN ON PUBLIC ACCESS SECOND AND FOURTH WEDNESDAYS.

 Party on Carl. Party on George. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Carl Boyer, Mayor George Pederson and their peers made their first 
regular appearance on Santa Clarita's public access channel Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5 p.m. broadcast on Channel 20 was a replay of the council meeting held 
one day earlier. Videotaped by a lone camera from the back of the council 
chamber and broadcast without editing, it served as an early indicator of how 
residents and elected officials will act under a video camera's watchful eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics had warned of distractions from activists, political hopefuls or 
government officials playing to the television audience. Naysayers hinted at 
grandstanding worthy of fiction's most well-known public access show -- Wayne's 
World. 
</P>
<P>
 Not.  
</P>
<P>
 Although some council members dressed a bit more formally and city staffers 
had to remember to switch on their microphones when speaking, the Tuesday 
session proceeded as usual. 
</P>
<P>
 Pederson presented certificates for good deeds. Councilwoman Jan Heidt read a 
list of simple philosophies for her invocation. Residents complained about a 
library tax, a "decrepit" mobile home in a residential neighborhood and plans 
for a large shopping center near the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The typical council actions are exactly what the public needs to see, said 
Allan Cameron, who has called for public access channels in Santa Clarita since 
before it became an incorporated city in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 Airing the meetings makes government more accountable and is far more 
beneficial than any imagined problems, Cameron said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's say that every frustrated Al Jolson, Mick Jagger and Robin Williams 
comes to try out their act. So what?" said Cameron. "Do the negatives outweigh 
the positives? The answer, proven across the country, is no." 
</P>
<P>
 Council meetings are held on the second and fourth Tuesday of the month, and 
are scheduled to be shown on Channel 20 at 5 p.m. the following day.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; CITY OFFERS TO CUT REDEVELOPMENT AREA; 
LAWSUIT: OFFICIALS PROPOSE SCALING BACK PROJECT 25% TO END REVENUE DISPUTE WITH 
THE CASTAIC LAKE WATER AGENCY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 City officials Wednesday offered to slash the scope of their $1.1-billion 
redevelopment plan by one-fourth to settle a lawsuit filed by the Castaic Lake 
Water Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 If accepted, Santa Clarita's Community Recovery Plan would be capped at $854 
million in projects and exclude much of the Saugus community previously marked 
for redevelopment -- a cut of about 25% of the original plan's geographic area. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer was made Wednesday morning to water agency representatives. The 
water wholesaler has filed two lawsuits aimed at blocking the 30-year 
redevelopment plan, which would use future property tax increases the agency 
wants to pay off bond debts, including $132 million for its new Rio Vista Water 
Treatment Plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a proposal to them that we feel addresses the concerns expressed by 
them," Santa Clarita Mayor George Pederson said. "We think, we hope, this will 
resolve the lawsuit." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council adopted the Community Recovery Plan in February to help the 
city recuperate from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, improve its roads and 
other infrastructure needs, redevelop blighted areas and build affordable 
housing.  
</P>
<P>
 Water agency officials, expecting to lose $60 million or more in potential 
property tax revenue over the life of the plan, alleged in two lawsuits that 
the plan goes far beyond fixing earthquake damage. A Los Angeles Superior Court 
judge in July rejected one suit, but the other is pending and prevents the city 
from moving forward with the projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members of the water agency haven't responded to the city's offer, but 
praised council members for seeking a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a very substantive proposal," said Mary Spring, president of the 
water agency's board. She called the offer a "good faith effort" on the part of 
Santa Clarita officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Spring estimated that water agency representatives will respond to the offer 
within a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Pederson and Councilman H. Clyde Smyth, who helped negotiate the 
proposal after a series of six meetings with water agency personnel, are 
optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a good feeling about this morning. I have a feeling great strides were 
taken," Smyth said. "I look forward to an early and positive response from the 
agency." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are open to all suggestions they make," Pederson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Water agency officials in August asked Santa Clarita to cut the redevelopment 
plan to $770 million and limit the agency's loss of revenue to $21 million, in 
exchange for dropping the lawsuit. The city's counteroffer Wednesday doesn't go 
that far, but is still much smaller than the initial plan. 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of Santa Clarita's land was encompassed in the original plan, 
whereas about 45% of city property is covered in the smaller plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clarita officials say that the redevelopment plan can still accomplish 
its goals, even if the monetary value and project area are both slashed by a 
fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you've got to do is establish priorities," Smyth said. "There's never 
enough money to do what you want."

DEION SANDERS SET TO JOIN 49ERS TODAY; PRO FOOTBALL: ALL-PRO DEFENSIVE BACK IS 
EXPECTED TO SIGN A ONE-YEAR, $1.2-MILLION CONTRACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 As if the San Francisco 49ers, having added three Pro Bowl players to their 
defense, didn't have enough bright lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're turning neon. 
</P>
<P>
 Deion Sanders, arguably the most powerful defensive weapon in the NFL, is 
expected to sign a one-year contract with the 49ers today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neon Deion," a Pro Bowl cornerback, is expected to be in uniform Sunday when 
the 49ers visit the Rams in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The club apparently was waiting until today to announce the deal so it would 
not be overshadowed by the official ending of the baseball season. It was the 
baseball announcement that freed Sanders from his obligations as center fielder 
for the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders flew to the Bay Area Wednesday and is expected at a news conference 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some very sensitive negotiations going on," said Carmen Policy, the 
49ers' president. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders, a free agent who openly sought the best chance to play in a Super 
Bowl, picked the 49ers over a long list of suitors including New Orleans, 
Miami, Kansas City, Philadelphia and his previous team in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sanders, the 49ers finally have a strong, fearless defensive back who can 
handle the likes of Dallas Cowboy receivers Michael Irvin and Alvin Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 In each of the last two seasons, the Cowboys have defeated the 49ers in the 
NFC championship game thanks, in part, to big plays by Irvin and Harper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys always have bragged that they have a player, cornerback Kevin 
Smith, who is not afraid of 49er star receiver Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with Sanders probably joining Merton Hanks in the defensive backfield 
while forcing shaky Eric Davis to the bench, the 49ers can return the favor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deion Sanders is in a class by himself," said Eric Allen, star cornerback of 
the Philadelphia Eagles. "He's got everything. He does it all well; hit, run, 
cover." 
</P>
<P>
 Tim McDonald, the 49er safety who was one of three players who agreed to 
renegotiated contracts so Sanders' approximately $1.2-million deal could fit 
under the salary cap, was excited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deion's a great player and he brings a lot," McDonald told reporters. "He 
brings excellent man-to-man coverage skills. He brings a lot of charisma and a 
lot of excitement and I think he's all business once he steps on the football 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 Linebackers Ken Norton and Gary Plummer were the two others who renegotiated 
their contracts to make room for Sanders. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco Coach George Seifert has called Sanders the best defensive back 
in the game today. While players agreed he will be an important addition, 
expect some initial locker room problems while room is being created for his 
sometimes intimidating presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are going to be some feelings hurt," Hanks told reporters. "There's 
going to be a shake-up in the secondary, because he has to play. He has to 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers have recently become concerned about their defense after allowing 
their former quarterback, Joe Montana, to pass for 203 yards and two touchdowns 
against them in the Kansas City Chiefs' 24-17 victory Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Their worries doubled a day later, when it was discovered that their top pass 
rusher, Richard Dent, could miss at least six weeks because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 But John McVay, 49er vice president for football operations, is certain 
Sanders will be an instant help to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "This guy is something else, he's the real thing," McVay said last Saturday, 
"He's really something special. He's everything they say he is." 
</P>
<P>
 Policy, the club president, said he was confident Sanders would become a 49er 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a very, very good feeling about this," he said Wednesday, "but it's 
not done till it's done. I think they know we've gone as far as we can go 
(financially). We've done all we could do in the framework of a one-year deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile Falcon President Taylor Smith said the team still assumes Sanders 
will give Atlanta a chance to match the best offer from another club. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the (money) is what it's rumored to be . . . then I know we can be 
competitive with that kind of offer," Atlanta Coach June Jones said.

BASEBALL '94: GOING, GOING. . .GONE; NO LIGHT AT END OF THEIR TUNNEL; DODGERS: 
O'MALLEY AND PLAYERS LAMENT WHAT COULD HAVE BEEN AN AWARD-WINNING FINISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A lamp lit the path from the Dodger clubhouse to the dugout Wednesday 
afternoon, but at the end of the tunnel, the gates to the field were locked. As 
one peered through the screen, the now-empty romance of the Dodger season 
seemed to tease, for what might have been. For what will never be. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would like to reflect back on the season, but unfortunately you look back 
and it was like the season was all for naught," pitcher Tom Candiotti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs in the Dodger offices, employees watched on television as Bud Selig, 
acting baseball commissioner, canceled the season, aborting the hopes of the 
Dodgers' first postseason appearance in five years and placing some of their 
jobs in jeopardy as well. That includes Manager Tom Lasorda, whose contract was 
up at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Dodger owner) Peter O'Malley has more to worry about than me," Lasorda said 
while eating another no-game meal at a Pasadena restaurant after leaving the 
stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Lasorda echoed the reaction of most of the Dodger players, who spoke of 
sadness for the game and the fans, and disbelief that it had come to this. 
O'Malley, speaking by phone from Dublin, Ireland, where he is promoting Little 
League and amateur baseball, said he didn't think the season would end this 
way, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought both sides were smart enough to do everything possible to prevent 
it from happening," O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Back in Atlanta, Brett Butler said he was in shock, not understanding how a 
$2-billion industry could be shut down. "I can't believe that the big-market 
clubs could allow Selig to do that," he said. "I thought George (Steinbrenner) 
or Peter (O'Malley) or Ted (Turner) would say 'Come on, let's go.' But to sit 
on the salary cap for 20 months, everybody lost in this one and this is a black 
eye for baseball. Baseball will be scarred for life." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley, once considered one of the most powerful owners in baseball, was 
unhappy that Selig excluded him from negotiations, according to sources. But 
when asked why he take didn't try to take a more active role, O'Malley said: "I 
was not a member of the executive council or Player Relations Committee. If I 
were asked to be on those committees, I would have been. I have been on these 
committees in the past, but I realize that everybody can't be on these 
committees all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . All the time we had hope, and the negotiating group for each side said 
they were flexible, it wasn't a situation of take it or leave it," O'Malley 
said. "And I said, and was quoted several times as saying, now is the time to 
show that flexibility. But they never did." 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger first baseman Eric Karros said that from Aug. 11, the day the players 
walked out, he knew the season was over. "You can ask Mike (Piazza) about this, 
because the day we walked out I said that was it, I guess I was looking at it 
from a pessimistic point of view," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This was the year that baseball had a chance to make some strides forward, 
and what happened is that we made 10 strides backward. The thing is you are not 
talking about one single player or one single team, but it's disappointing for 
the game as a whole. I think Mr. O'Malley said it best when he said the players 
and owners are holding hands and jumping off the bridge together. It's not one 
side trying to beat the other side; in the end both sides lost." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Karros, along with many of the other Dodger players, continued to 
work out, not only in the gym but on playing fields as well. When the strike 
started, the Dodgers were in first place in the National League West, 3 1/2 
games ahead of the San Francisco Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, we won, didn't we?" Piazza said from Philadelphia, where he is visiting 
his family. "I told Eric we should get some guys together and have a party, 
because we are champs. In fact, I just talked to Barry Bonds on the phone a 
couple of hours ago, and I told him we won, and he said we won by forfeit. I 
said, 'So what? A victory is a victory.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But Piazza doesn't feel that anybody won in the negotiations, calling it a 
battle between the small-market owners and the large-market owners, not the 
owners and players. "It's a shame, because the fans suffer and we suffer and 
everybody suffers. But what are you going to do about it? That's how I seem to 
end each conversation. What are you going to do about it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Jim Gott said Piazza was one of the players who worked out for most of 
the strike. "I came up with a new pitch and have thrown every other day since 
the season stopped and there were five other guys who were doing the same 
thing," Gott said. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Kevin) Gross, Orel Hershiser, Candy (Candiotti), Piazza and Karros were some 
of them. I would call up a few of my friends, who just happened to be some of 
the best players in the world, and go and throw batting practice. One Sunday 
morning I met Carlos (Hernandez) and Henry (Rodriguez) on a field at the crack 
of dawn with dew still on the ground. It was a blast." 
</P>
<P>
 Gott is one of 10 free agents on the Dodgers, many of whom won't be back next 
season, whenever that is. "We were in first place and Tim Wallach would have 
probably been the comeback player of the year and Raul Mondesi would be the 
rookie of the year, and probably still will be," Piazza said. "Billy Ashley is 
having a great year (in the minors) and he would have been up in September to 
help us and we probably would have seen pitcher Greg Hansell for the first 
time, who is a local guy. It is clearly the season that could have been, and 
obviously not only for the Dodgers, but for baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the players cleaned out their lockers when the strike began, 
Piazza hasn't been back to the Dodger clubhouse. His locker, virtually 
untouched, still has an array of baseball cards hanging above, including one of 
broadcaster Jim Rome. Mondesi, who left immediately for the Dominican Republic 
when the strike began, has a package of fan mail. Cory Snyder, also a free 
agent, still has his multitude of gloves waiting for him to play again.

 Five birds that Lasorda kept caged in his office and named after his infield, 
plus Piazza, had been taken home by a clubhouse attendant. Lasorda put them in 
the dugout once during batting practice, and when the team won, it became a 
ritual. He often pointed out how they sung after a victory.

<P>
 Wednesday, there was only silence.

BASEBALL '94: GOING, GOING. . .GONE; IT'S THE STRAW THAT BREAKS AUTRYS' BACKS; 
ANGELS: OWNERS WILL EVENTUALLY SELL TEAM FOR $130 MILLION AFTER AN AGREEMENT. 
DISNEY A POSSIBLE BUYER.

<P>
 Angel owner Jackie Autry, who has warned for years that major league baseball 
was headed for calamity, no longer bears the burden of proof. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry signed the document that formally ended the 1994 season Wednesday, then 
said that she and her husband, Gene Autry, have decided to sell the ballclub. 
</P>
<P>
 She added, however, that there will be no sale until there has been resolution 
of baseball's labor dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 The Autrys have told four prospective buyers that they are asking $130 
million, although only 23% of the club will be sold while Gene Autry, 87, 
remains alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I've said repeatedly that the club is not for sale, but it's come to a 
point where enough is enough," Jackie Autry said. "You can only take so much 
money out of your own pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just had to make that decision to do something to make more people 
responsible for the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's about time fans and the media understand that here you have an 
owner who loves baseball, but the current situation makes it impossible for him 
to carry the burden himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Terms of the sale, according to sources familiar with the negotiations, 
stipulate an immediate $30-million fee for 23% of the club. The minority owner 
then will be required to pay Autry $3 million each year to maintain the option 
to purchase the rest of the club within six months of Gene Autry's death. 
</P>
<P>
 The new owner will become managing partner immediately, according to Jackie 
Autry, responsible for all operating costs, and any possible debt. The Autrys, 
however, will receive 67% of profits until 100% completion of the sale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gene loves baseball, but he's 87, and it's time for him to relinquish total 
control of the club," Jackie Autry said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is a bottomless pit. Everybody keeps saying Gene Autry is so rich. . . 
. Well, it's nobody's business whether Gene is worth one penny or $300 million. 
How long do you want to keep borrowing just to pay the payroll? 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been like a freight train coming down the track and no one has 
stopped it. I was the first to say this back in 1990, and people said, 'Well, 
that's Jackie Autry. What does she know about baseball?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She would not identify the four prospective buyers, but it is believed she has 
had preliminary negotiations with Walt Disney Co. and billionaire Marvin Davis. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Autry paid $2 million for the expansion club in 1961, but has been 
operating it the last five years without any minority partners. Jackie Autry 
said the team will lose $8 million this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just so depressing," she said. "It's sad when it has to come to this." 
</P>
<P>
 Autry's problems are a microcosm of the financial difficulties major league 
owners say they are enduring, and it is why major league baseball officially 
shut down the season Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought I'd be embarrassed to be a major league ballplayer, but I am 
now," Angel infielder Rex Hudler said. "I can't even look people in the face 
right now.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a horrible thing, and everyone that was part of this will be scarred for 
the rest of their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler, so angered at the news Wednesday, ripped his shirt while watching 
acting commissioner Bud Selig's press conference, sending buttons flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel players were told of the official decision in a conference call 
conducted by Mark Langston, their player representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Until there is a settlement, the Angels will be wondering about their futures. 
Will the new owner make front-office changes? What will happen to their free 
agents -- Bo Jackson, Harold Reynolds, Bob Patterson, Ken Patterson, Hudler and 
John Dopson? When can the Angels resume negotiations with Chili Davis about a 
multiyear contract that will pay him about $4 million a year? 
</P>
<P>
 Angel President Richard Brown said, "Right now, we can't do anything with any 
intelligence because we don't know what rules we're operating on. We're just 
going to have to wait." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels have eight players under contract for the 1995 season, but no one 
knows what will happen to the rest. Several owners privately say they will open 
spring training camps on time next season, and if there still is no labor 
agreement, will invite players to come into camp, crossing the picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brian (Anderson) said to me the other day, 'Mom, what would I do?' " said 
Janet Anderson, mother of the Angel rookie pitcher. " 'I don't have millions 
sitting around.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who has begun taking accounting classes at Wright State in Dayton, 
Ohio, said he would not cross picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to have to be a time when a decision has to be made, but I'm 
not going to be a trend setter and cross," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said rookie outfielder Jim Edmonds: "It's just amazing what this has done to 
all of us. It's like I don't even care about the World Series. I'm not a fan 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels now are left with the bitter taste of a 47-68 season, second-worst 
winning percentage in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
 Most painful, of course, is the idea that baseball will be left without a 
World Series for the first time since 1904. What once seemed incomprehensible 
has become reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Said outfielder Tim Salmon, "We made history, and it's sure a lousy feeling to 
know you're part of it."

DEION COULD SIGN WITH 49ERS TODAY; PRO FOOTBALL: SAN FRANCISCO CAUTIOUS, BUT 
HOPES TO COMPLETE ONE-YEAR, $1.3-MILLION DEAL FOR ALL-PRO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the baseball season gone, Deion Sanders wasted no time closing in on a 
new job with the San Francisco 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 A free-agent cornerback and Cincinnati Reds outfielder, Sanders shopped his 
services to several NFL teams while idled by the monthlong baseball players 
strike. On Wednesday, the owners called off the season. 
</P>
<P>
 With his baseball job gone, at least for this season, Sanders was ready to 
turn his attention to football, said his agent, Eugene Parker. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders told an Atlanta television station he had decided against rejoining 
the Atlanta Falcons and intended to sign with the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 In their bid to sign Sanders, the 49ers freed $1.3 million under the salary 
cap by restructuring the contracts of linebackers Gary Plummer and Ken Norton 
and safety Tim McDonald. 
</P>
<P>
 Club president Carmen Policy said Sanders, a three-time Pro Bowler in five 
seasons with the Falcons, flew to the San Francisco Bay area on Wednesday. 
Policy said he hoped to complete a deal within the next 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some very sensitive negotiations going on," Policy said. "We're 
talking numbers. We're talking incentives. We're talking a variety of things. 
We're even talking philosophy." 
</P>
<P>
 Just two weeks ago, Policy said the 49ers couldn't afford Sanders because of 
salary-cap constraints, Now he was optimistic the two sides could come to 
terms. However, he was wary of competing offers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not in there alone," Policy said. "If I was to stand here and tell you 
it was done, I would be really acting foolhardy. I don't know what's going on 
behind the scenes. His coming out here may be nothing more than priming the 
pump to get Atlanta to really come through with a final offer." 
</P>
<P>
 Falcons president Taylor Smith said the team still assumed Sanders would give 
Atlanta a chance to match the best offer from another club. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the (money) is what it's rumored to be . . . . then I know we can be 
competitive with that kind of offer," Atlanta Coach June Jones said. "Deion 
knows we want him here, and he knows this is the best fit for what he wants to 
accomplish." 
</P>
<P>
 Should Sanders sign with the 49ers, he would be the sixth defensive free agent 
added to the team. San Francisco (1-1) earlier added Norton, Plummer, Toi Cook, 
Rickey Jackson and Richard Dent. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco Coach George Seifert has called Sanders the best defensive back 
in the game today and players agreed his addition could make a great impact. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would only make us better and I'm all for anyone coming here who would 
make us better," Cook said. "It's all about winning and any player that's going 
to help us win, bring him here." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonald, who was among the players agreeing to renegotiated contracts, added: 
"Deion's a great player and he brings a lot. He brings excellent man to man 
coverage skills. He brings a lot of charisma and a lot of excitement and I 
think he's all business once he steps on the football field." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders had been seeking a long-term, $4 million-a-year deal, but apparently 
has conceded the NFL's $34.6 million salary cap makes that impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "As always, it's Deion's call," Parker told the Atlanta Journal on Tuesday. "I 
think he knows what he wants to do. I think he knows where he wants to be and 
how to get there."

BASEBALL '94: GOING, GOING. . .GONE; IN A WAY, IT'S 1904 ALL OVER; HISTORY: 
NINETY YEARS AGO, THE WORLD SERIES WAS NOT PLAYED BECAUSE OF A PERSONALITY FEUD 
BETWEEN THE SPORT'S POWER BROKERS.

<P>
 Baseball has withstood scandal, broken the color barrier and persevered 
through two World Wars and George Steinbrenner. Yet, for the second time this 
century, the bickering boys of back rooms have lowered the curtain on a 
national pastime's final act. 
</P>
<P>
 Author Benton Stark once wrote: "So many wounds, so many raw nerve endings, so 
many distended egos -- Just too many for there to have been a World Series . . 
.  
</P>
<P>
 " . . . in 1904." 
</P>
<P>
 A familiar ring? 
</P>
<P>
 After 90 years without interruption -- a span in which Halley's Comet has 
twice come and gone -- the Fall Classic has again fallen victim to baseball's 
orbital hardheadedness. Donald Fehr, meet Ban Johnson. Richard Ravitch and Bud 
Selig, meet John T. Brush and John McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig, Ravitch and Fehr are this year's Fall guys. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1904, it was self-righteous vindictiveness among the towering baseball 
figures of the day -- Johnson, Brush and McGraw -- that denied fans the second 
modern-era World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1991 book, "The Year They Called off the World Series," Stark writes, 
"These men were able to get away with their decision because they were within 
their rights as understood in their era." 
</P>
<P>
 Like today, the controversy in 1904 took center stage in New York. It was not 
a labor dispute, as such, but rather a no-holds-barred, egomaniacal feud that 
evolved over time. 
</P>
<P>
 Like today, the welfare of the fans did not seem of paramount concern. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1904, there was even a sportswriter to blame. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's principals don't quite measure up to the 1904 characters, particularly 
to McGraw, the foul-mouthed, cantankerous, legendary manager of the New York 
Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 In the biography, "John McGraw," by Charles C. Alexander, an umpire was 
convinced McGraw "ate gun powder every morning and washed it down with warm 
blood." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1904 World Series was not played because McGraw, the Giants' manager, and 
Brush, owner of the National League pennant winners, held deep-seated contempt 
for Johnson, president of the upstart American League. 
</P>
<P>
 Publicly, McGraw and Brush claimed the American League was merely unworthy of 
the competition. "They're a bunch of . . . bush leaguers," McGraw is quoted to 
have said. 
</P>
<P>
 An interesting statement, considering McGraw had played and managed in the AL, 
and that these "bush leaguers" had won the first modern World Series of 1903, 
when the Boston Pilgrims defeated the Pittsburgh Pirates. 
</P>
<P>
 Ban Johnson had formed the rival American League in 1901 and soon raided the 
established National League of talent. One of his biggest coups was McGraw, who 
jumped leagues to manage a new AL franchise in Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 But the McGraw-Johnson relationship soon soured, so McGraw returned to Brush's 
National League Giants and turned the team into a powerhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw's Giants coasted to the 1904 NL pennant. Johnson, who desperately 
wanted to establish an American League foothold in New York, had seemingly done 
so with the Highlanders, forerunners to the Yankees, who contended until the 
final day. 
</P>
<P>
 Brush and McGraw, however, made it clear early on that the Giants would not 
give the fans what they wanted -- a New York World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neither would risk giving Ban Johnson his greatest triumph," Benton Stark 
writes. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Brush announced the formation of a postseason world tour involving 
members of the Giants and Chicago Colts, sabotaging any plans of a World 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men -- Brush and McGraw -- held the baseball world hostage. It mattered 
not that 10,000 New Yorkers signed a petition demanding a championship series. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson countered that McGraw and Brush were afraid of losing, an idea that 
had merit. 
</P>
<P>
 The newspapers crucified Brush. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Tribune wrote: "If he was any kind of sportsman, he would play the 
series if he expected to get licked, rather than face the charges of quitting. 
But Brush does not think the Giants can win." 
</P>
<P>
 How three men ended up in New York's caldron of 1904, and how two men came to 
despise one, is a tale of power, ego and betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 Brush's hatred for Johnson can be traced to 1890. John Tomlinson Brush, born 
in 1845, orphaned at 4, made his fortune in the clothing business. In 1887, he 
was the 42-year-old owner of the Indianapolis franchise, one of the National 
League's weaker teams. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1890, Brush went to New York to help rebuild the Giants, devastated by 
defections to the Players League. 
</P>
<P>
 For his rescue efforts, Brush was rewarded with a new franchise in Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the sports editor of the Cincinnati Commerical-Gazette had lobbied 
hard for another owner and ripped Brush in print at every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 The scribe? 
</P>
<P>
 A 26-year-old visionary named Byron Bancroft (Ban) Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Brush retaliated by pulling Johnson's press credential. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1890s, McGraw was busy establishing himself as one of baseball's most 
notorious and belligerent players. John Joseph McGraw was only 5 feet 7 and 155 
pounds, but as third baseman for the legendary Baltimore Orioles, he probably 
caused more grief than any player before or since. 
</P>
<P>
 For McGraw, known as "Little Napoleon," baseball was a life-and-death affair. 
He grew up hard, in Truxton, N.Y., the son of an unskilled laborer. In the 
winter of 1884-85, he lost his mother, two sisters and two brothers to 
diphtheria. 
</P>
<P>
 John Heydler, an umpire of the era who later became NL president, described 
McGraw's Orioles as "mean, vicious, ready at any time to maim rival players or 
umpires if it helped their cause." 
</P>
<P>
 As a strategist, McGraw was a practitioner of "Little Ball." The Orioles 
scrapped for runs with their choked-up bats, perfecting a style of hitting that 
came to be known in lore as "the Baltimore Chop." 
</P>
<P>
 Ban Johnson, meanwhile, was forging his own legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 By the 1890s, the staid National League had become a 12-team monopoly. Since 
forming in 1876, the senior circuit had fought off several challenges from 
rival leagues -- notably the American Assn. and the Players League. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson mounted his rival charge in 1893, when he took over the Western 
League, a foundering minor circuit, and turned it into a financial success. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1900, he changed its name to the American League and proclaimed it a major 
competitor. In a shrewd move, Johnson appeased the players' union by not 
recognizing the NL's suffocating "reserve clause," which bound a player's 
rights to his team for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Players jumped to the new league in droves, setting off a war. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson promised his league would be free of the scourge that had soiled the 
NL with its high-spiked shenanigans. McGraw, of course, was Kid Scoundrel. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson called his brand of play "Clean Ball" and issued edicts proclaiming 
profanity and bad sportsmanship would not be tolerated. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, unbelievably, but for obvious political reasons, he coaxed McGraw away 
from the National League. McGraw had been set to manage the NL Baltimore 
franchise, but the team was dissolved in 1900 when the league reduced from 12 
to eight teams. 
</P>
<P>
 It was naive to think Johnson and McGraw were ever going to peacefully 
coexist. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, at a Chicago meeting in 1900, Johnson offered McGraw the job as manager 
of a new AL franchise in Baltimore, also to be called the Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw accepted and agreed to curb his abhorrent behavior. He also helped lead 
a raid on National League players. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, though, he became the bane of Ban. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw continued cursing umpires and stomping on their toes. Joe McGinnity, 
one of his pitchers, was suspended in September for shoving an umpire and 
soaking him with tobacco juice. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening day, 1902, McGraw was ejected for using foul language. A week later, 
he drew a five-game suspension after he was accused of inciting Baltimore fans 
to attack an umpire. 
</P>
<P>
 The Johnson-McGraw alliance quickly unraveled. When Johnson decided in 1902 to 
move the Baltimore team to New York, it became clear to McGraw he was not part 
of the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting wind of Johnson's intentions, McGraw struck first and began 
negotiations with owner Andrew Freedman to manage the New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Claiming he was owed money, McGraw demanded out of his Baltimore contract and 
eventually won his release July 19. 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, as chronicled in Alexander's biography of the manager, McGraw 
said Johnson had planned "to ditch me at the end of the 1902 season. So I acted 
fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson accused McGraw of being a traitor on par with Benedict Arnold. 
</P>
<P>
 The McGraw-Johnson feud had taken firm hold. Eager to get in on action was 
John T. Brush, an old nemesis. 
</P>
<P>
 As chairman of the NL Executive Committee, Brush engineered a stock-buying 
scheme that left Freedman, the Giants' owner, with majority interest of the 
Orioles. 
</P>
<P>
 Freedman promptly shipped all the Orioles' best players to New York, where 
they were reunited with McGraw and the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was outraged, but there was little he could do. 
</P>
<P>
 Brush wasn't through. In the fall of 1902, he purchased the Giants from 
Freedman for $200,000 and stood poised to challenge Johnson for the valuable 
baseball turf that was New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than mutual contempt for Johnson, Brush also had little in common with 
McGraw. In fact, it was Brush who had earlier drafted baseball's "Purification 
Plan," which had proposed to rid the game of "obscene, indecent or vulgar 
language." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Brush was not about to let purification stand in the way of a 
vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1903, the National League owners vowed to make peace with Johnson and the 
American League. The lone dissenter was Brush. 
</P>
<P>
 Brush vowed to keep Johnson out of New York, but he, too, at last relented. 
The New York Highlanders began play in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the deal, Johnson, not such a union man after all, agreed the AL 
would abide by the "reserve clause." 
</P>
<P>
 The pieces were in place for the New York showdown of 1904. 
</P>
<P>
 No one is sure what might have happened had the Highlanders won the pennant 
and been denied a subway series. 
</P>
<P>
 Some suspect there would have been rioting in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, the Highlanders lost the pennant on the final day when Jack Chesbro, 
a 41-game-winner, uncorked a wild pitch that allowed Boston to win the title. 
</P>
<P>
 Brush, who had already played his hand by insisting the Giants would not meet 
the Highlanders, was hardly in a position to accept a challenge to play Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 So, no World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Giants, most notably pitcher "Iron Man" Joe McGinnity, were livid 
about Brush's decision, which cost the players a percentage of gate receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The truth is that for both Brush and McGraw, disdain for the American League 
upstarts was mixed with fear of losing to them, as Pittsburgh had done in 
1903," Alexander writes in his biography of McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
 What of Brush's postseason plans for a world tour with his baseball team? 
</P>
<P>
 Never happened. It was simply a ploy to rankle Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, it was Brush who, in 1905, formulated plans for a regular World 
Series between the leagues, a blueprint that remains almost unchanged today. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw probably didn't have to fear losing the 1904 World Series. The next 
year, with essentially the same cast, his Giants whipped Connie Mack's 
Philadelphia Athletics, four games to one. Christy Mathewson threw three 
shutouts in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 McGraw went on to manage 10 pennant winners in a 30-year career. He died in 
February, 1934, and was among the second class elected to the Hall of Fame in 
1937. 
</P>
<P>
 As Brush lay on his death bed in 1912, Ban Johnson paid him a visit and the 
two reconciled their differences. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson remained a prominent figure in the game until he was forced into 
retirement in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 When Johnson died in 1931, McGraw, putting the feud behind him, told the 
Sporting News that "Johnson was a great fighter and organizer," and that the 
American League was "a monument to his genius." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1937, the year McGraw was enshrined, Johnson was inducted into the Hall of 
Fame.

<P>
 No, Virginia, there is no baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for your letter, little girl. I am so sorry that you will not get to 
see your favorite team again this year. Please come back when you're older. 
</P>
<P>
 How did this happen? How did everybody get so knuckleheaded that an entire 
baseball season had to be scrapped? What went so wrong that the World has to do 
without a Series for the first time since men started automobiles with a crank? 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia, I wish I knew. 
</P>
<P>
 All I know is that the players called for an intentional walk. 
</P>
<P>
 All I know is that the owners called for the squeeze. 
</P>
<P>
 All I know is that they both struck out. 
</P>
<P>
 What did the players want? They wanted to increase the minimum salary from 
$109,000 to between $175,000 and $200,000. They wanted alterations in 
arbitration and free agency. They wanted home teams sharing 25% of ticket money 
with visiting teams. They wanted to make as much as they could make. 
</P>
<P>
 What did the owners want? They wanted to divvy up revenue, 50-50. They wanted 
arbitration terminated. They wanted to match any offer to keep any player who 
had been with them for fewer than six years. And they wanted to make as much as 
they could make. 
</P>
<P>
 What killed baseball, Virginia? 
</P>
<P>
 Money, honey. 
</P>
<P>
 Fools and their ballclubs are soon parted. The workers walked out and the 
bosses said, "Stay out." The union spokesman and the management spokesman 
fiddled while baseball burned. The commissioner did nothing because there is no 
commissioner. The President of the United States did nothing because his job is 
to protect and preserve the public welfare, not the public recreation. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, on Sept. 14, 1994, a day that will live in idiocy, baseball dropped 
dead. 
</P>
<P>
 It was hara-kiri. Self-inflicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Black armbands for everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs on every doorknob: 
</P>
<P>
 CLOSED TILL FURTHER NOTICE 
</P>
<P>
 One, two, three strikes, they're out. 
</P>
<P>
 Going, going, gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers finished first. Congratulations. Tony Gwynn hit .394, the highest 
batting average since 1941. Congratulations. Matt Williams won the major league 
home run title with 43. Way to go. Greg Maddux's earned-run average, a sweet 
1.56. Hell of a season, kid. Buff that big Cy Young trophy until it gleams. 
</P>
<P>
 Save those ticket stubs, Virginia, because you never know, you might never see 
a baseball game again. Maybe somebody will create a new league. Maybe next 
spring you can see Barry Bonds and the Sacramento Gold Sox versus Ken Griffey 
Jr. and the Tacoma Tyrannosaurus. Maybe the union organizers can call up Donald 
Trump and Oprah Winfrey and the heirs of Sam Walton and some more of America's 
Richest People and organize their own league, with no rules and no obligations, 
$1,000 for a single, $2,000 for a double, $5,000 for a triple and $10,000 for a 
homer, sign right here on the bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners called the players' bluff, Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Never, never, never, never, never, never, never did the players truly believe 
that the owners would close the cookie jar on their fingers this way. Oh, the 
jokes they made about going out to the golf course and having a wonderful time 
washing the doggy with the kids. In their hearts, they believed every owner 
would crumble like a mummy in a wind storm. Give up. Go limp. Chicken out. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them nearly did. That owner from Colorado wavered and quavered for a 
while. Poor fellow, packin' 'em in 70,000 at a pop, raking in the dough with a 
sophomore-year team. Rocky in more ways than one, that guy. 
</P>
<P>
 And, when the formal resolution came down from the mount Wednesday, with all 
of its whereases and therefores and valedictory jabberwocky, a couple of 
signatures remained missing, one from the owner of the Baltimore Orioles, who 
might have been too sorrowful for words, and one from the owner of the 
Cincinnati Reds, who probably had stepped out for a smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The season of '94 was dead as a cow turned into a fielder's mitt. And nothing, 
not a stay of execution and not a writ of habeas corpus, could bring it back. 
</P>
<P>
 1984 gave us a Detroit gang that won 35 of its first 40. 
</P>
<P>
 1974 gave us some scraggly, scrappy Oakland A's. 
</P>
<P>
 1964 was worth a whole David Halberstam book. 
</P>
<P>
 1954 was Willie Mays vs. the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 1944 put St. Louis against St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 1934, Van Lingle Mungo lost the All-Star game. 
</P>
<P>
 1924, the Washington Senators won it all. 
</P>
<P>
 1914, Boston (not the Red Sox) swept the Series. 
</P>
<P>
 1904, there was no Series. 
</P>
<P>
 We thought such a thing could never happen again, Virginia. Baseball was 
enduring and permanent, perpetual motion and perpetual emotion. Carpetbaggers 
and money-grubbers had been around forever -- crooks and tinhorns even rigged a 
bogus World Series once -- but always was it played. Never in 90 years was it 
dangled in front of us like a purse on a string, then yanked away, leaving us 
feeling like chumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The World Series is just like the World Cup, a scoreless tie. Maybe they could 
stick the names of all the first-place teams into a hat and pick out a winner. 
It beats penalty kicks. 
</P>
<P>
 Read elsewhere, Virginia, for actual results of actual games. Baseball doesn't 
belong on the sports pages now, but on the obit pages. Be sure to tell your 
children and grandchildren someday that when you were young, you were there on 
the day greed and avarice corrupted the sport you so loved. Kiss this one 
goodby, kid. Baseball has gone foul. BASEBALL STRIKE: DEVELOPMENTS FROM DAY 34

JIM MURRAY: CHANCE TO SAY FAREWELL TO ONE BOY OF SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Feel cheated? Feel the lack of a wholesome outlet for hostility? Ballplayers 
interfere with your God-given right to vent your spleen at the ballpark when 
they went on strike? Afraid you'll find yourself walking around with all this 
pent-up indignation? Afraid you might end up going home and kicking the dog?  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you're an upbeat person. You feel the need to encourage someone. Be 
positive. You want to get in the game with an optimistic outlook. Help the 
boys, not rag 'em. Instead of saying, "Call yerself a ballplayer, do you, 
Karros? You couldn't hit water if you fell in!" you want to say, "We're wit ya 
all the way, Eric, baby! We'll get him next time! This guy's got nothin!" 
</P>
<P>
 Either way, you'll get a chance to work out your frustrations Sunday night at 
the Hyatt Regency Downtown. It might be your last chance for a long while to 
boo or cheer real live Dodger ballplayers. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember Dodger ballplayers? Used to wear these blue and white uniforms 
with the red numbers? Came in all shapes and sizes. Power hitters, bunters, 
curveballers, knucklers. Used to play that funny game, nine a side, three 
strikes you're out. 
</P>
<P>
 You remember Casey at the bat? Koufax, Drysdale, Podres, Osteen. The Vulture. 
Phil Regan. Nobody hit 48 homers by midseason off that bunch. There was Garvey. 
Lopes and Russell. They had their own Reggie -- Smith. They had the Dook. Pee 
Wee.  
</P>
<P>
 We used to get our aggressions out. Also our joys. Kirk Gibson limping up to 
the plate to hit the homer that would win the Series. Maury Wills stealing the 
Giants blind.  
</P>
<P>
 Mike Piazza and Eric Karros won't be facing any 3-2 counts, but they will be 
facing a roast with Vin Scully as emcee and it'll probably be their last 
appearance before a baseball crowd in God knows how long. Baseball may just be 
a cobwebbed memory, as long gone as the one-horse shay, the buggy whip and the 
bicycle built for two.  
</P>
<P>
 There's another reason to attend Sunday night. The dinner honors what may be 
the last of the Dodgers, but it also honors the manager's late son, Tommy 
Lasorda Jr., a young man who died too soon and too tragically three years ago. 
The proceeds of the dinner will be used to build a gymnasium in his name in 
Orange County, a facility that will benefit all youngsters and, thus, all of 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 Spunky Lasorda, as he was known to family and friends, was, like a lot of us, 
miscast in the world he grew up in, his father's world. Ministers' sons run 
away to join the circus, doctors' sons become movie actors. Spunky grew up in a 
world of hit-and-run, sacrifice flies, home runs and home stands, bunts and 
base hits, but his tastes ran more to brushes and oils than bats and balls. His 
heroes were more apt to be Michelangelo than Michael Jordan, da Vinci than 
DiMaggio. A world series was a floor in the Louvre.  
</P>
<P>
 Part Pennsylvania Italian, part Tennessee Williams (he was born in his 
mother's native South Carolina), the young Tommy probably belonged more 
philosophically to Hollywood than to the National League. He was gifted, 
imaginative. He could whip out a cocktail napkin and do a caricature of you 
between the soup and the salad. He had the sure eye for color of an 
Impressionist. 
</P>
<P>
 He was, like his father, lively, gregarious, witty, animated, seldom still. He 
smiled a lot. Still, his milieu was the art gallery, not the dugout. 
</P>
<P>
 He died at thirty-something, when life is supposed to be just beginning, not 
ending, struck down after contracting HIV, the dreaded scourge of the 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 He deserves to be remembered, and his mother, Jo, cast about for ways to keep 
his memory evergreen. She knew she had found one when the ballplayer turned 
minister, John Werhas, suggested the community badly needed a gymnasium. Jo 
felt a prayer had been answered. Sunday's dinner is a big start for the Tommy 
Lasorda Jr. Memorial Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 So, even though it's not a seat in the upper deck from which to hurl nice safe 
insults, it's a way to get your final hoots or hails at the heart of the 
Dodgers' lineup. Baseball never stood taller than when it was helping children. 
</P>
<P>
 You can say goodby to a sport that left us. And you can lay a flower on the 
grave of a young son who never will.

MILLER STRUGGLES IN PAIN; PRO FOOTBALL: RAM QUARTERBACK GOT PAIN-KILLING SHOTS 
FOR AILING RIBS, AN APPARENT REASON FOR WOEFUL PASSING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Miller, who came to the Rams with a reputation for being one of the 
game's most accurate passers, has the worst completion percentage among the 28 
NFL starting quarterbacks after two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Something must be wrong, and apparently there is. 
</P>
<P>
 Team officials don't like to discuss such things, but Miller received three 
pain-killing injections in his rib cage for Sunday's game in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's just say that it hurts to cough and sneeze, let alone throw," said 
Miller, who has completed 44.4% of his passes this season. "My ribs were 
killing me last week, but I didn't want to give Atlanta any more fire, what 
with me coming back there for the first time and all." 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said team physicians cleared Miller to play last week, and 
Miller has assured him he is fit for duty. 
</P>
<P>
 "He threw the ball very well in practice today," Knox said. "He says he's 
fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller said he does not want it to appear that he is making excuses for his 
poor play. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller suffered the rib injury in the Rams' season-opening victory over 
Arizona when Cardinal defensive end Eric Swann smashed his helmet into Miller's 
ribs. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller balked at having X-rays taken but he said he has been receiving 
medication since for the persistent pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a bunch of cartilage damage and bumps all over my ribs," Miller said. 
"The bones aren't broken, but there were adhesions and it was pretty painful." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it just kills you to throw, and certain throws hurt more than 
others," he said. "The jogging, too, and that's why I was going into the locker 
room last week and riding the bike instead of running. But it is getting 
better."

PHILLIPS FINDS HOME ON THE PLAINS; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: ONCE-TROUBLED SOUTHLAND 
PREP STAR THRIVES AS NEBRASKA I-BACK AND FINDS STABILITY IN LINCOLN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometime tonight, Ty and Christine Pagone will take Lawrence Phillips to 
dinner in Lincoln, Neb. 
</P>
<P>
 They will talk about Saturday's game, about Phillips running the ball for the 
Cornhuskers against UCLA. And about the game last Thursday, when Phillips 
gained 175 yards against Texas Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 And they'll reminisce about when Phillips was at Baldwin Park High and about 
what he had to do to get to Lincoln. They'll laugh some, and then their voices 
will lower when they remember. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips will say thanks. Again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I owe them," Phillips said. "If it wasn't for (the Pagones and Baldwin Park 
Coach Tony Zane), I don't know where I'd be. It was either football or I don't 
know -- probably nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 He hadn't really been in trouble, but he hadn't been far from it when he 
showed up in Zane's office at Baldwin Park in the summer of 1991. It was only 
after investigating that Zane and Ty Pagone, Baldwin Park's assistant 
principal, learned how close Phillips had come to the point of no return for a 
teen-ager. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a tough family background," Zane said. 
</P>
<P>
 More like no family background. Ask Phillips where he calls home, and he says 
"probably the boys home" and then amends that to say California. He had lived 
in Inglewood, then at 42nd and Central in South Central. Then 103rd Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The law said he had to go to school, but it was easy to skip weeks at a time. 
The court decided that he needed the stability of a boys home in El Monte. Then 
one in West Covina. 
</P>
<P>
 An aunt lived down the street from Baldwin Park High, so he moved there and 
told Zane he wanted to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We checked him very closely because we didn't want any trouble with the CIF," 
Pagone said. "We went to the house and saw his clothes in the bedroom." 
</P>
<P>
 They talked to his social worker. Then they checked his transcript. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was barely eligible," Zane said. "He had no core courses, and we knew we 
had to get him back on track." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips had taken courses designed to get him a diploma, but little else, and 
in about two practices Zane saw that he had the potential to play college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 It was time to accelerate his education. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was suspicious of us at first," Pagone said. "I told him in my 
office that God had given him a gift that my kids didn't have, and that he was 
going to use it. We were pretty hard on him. We counseled him, guided him and 
occasionally kicked his butt." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Phillips: "They were stern and I got frustrated with them sometimes. I 
would just say, 'Leave me alone, I'm going to do it,' but they stayed on me." 
</P>
<P>
 He played safety, then slot receiver. By the season's second game, he was a 
running back. He gained more than 1,000 yards as a junior, and that brought the 
college recruiters. A quick look at his transcript sent many of them away. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he saw the interest in him, I think a light went on," Zane said. "He saw 
that we were right, that he could go on and play football at a higher level." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was catching up to do. He had moved back to the Tina Mack Boys 
Home in his senior year, and, with classes from 6:50 a.m. to 4 p.m., his days 
were full. Recruiting visits to USC, Arizona State, Illinois, Washington State 
and Nebraska claimed time too. 
</P>
<P>
 Zane picked him up every day, sometimes getting him out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
 But he passed his courses, and scored high enough on the Scholastic Aptitude 
Test to satisfy NCAA entrance requirements. Phillips could look at a wider 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a big USC fan, and I would have liked to see him playing there," Zane 
said. "But there was a new coach (John Robinson) and there was turmoil there. I 
think he also thought about where he had lived, close by SC, and that he could 
have problems going back." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Phillips: "A player was shot there at practice not long before." 
</P>
<P>
 While on the practice field at USC, Jon McGee, who is now at Arizona, was hit 
in the arm by a stray bullet from a fight a quarter-mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 George Darlington, Nebraska's defensive back coach and Southern California 
recruiter, had an answer for that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darlington said, 'Lawrence, we've had one homicide in Lincoln in the last 
five years,' " Zane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Darlington clearly wanted Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unusual, but we were only recruiting four I-backs the year we went after 
Lawrence," Darlington said. "You usually recruit about six to get one." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips was impressed, mostly with the Nebraska linemen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came back and said, 'Coach, you should have seen them,' " Zane said. 
</P>
<P>
 That Lincoln was a fair distance from Southern California seemed a blessing to 
Zane and Pagone, and they steered him to Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a chance for him to get away from a lot of the negative things he had 
in his life," Pagone said. "And Nebraska, that's where you want to be as a 
running back, isn't it?" 
</P>
<P>
 It has been. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips was listed as third-string as a freshman last season and was 
suspended for the first game because of fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 In the second game, he ran for 80 yards and a touchdown in 14 carries against 
Texas Tech, working behind starter Calvin Jones -- who is now a Raider -- and 
Damon Benning. Jones was injured, and Benning struggled in the third game, 
against UCLA in the Rose Bowl. Enter Phillips, who rushed for 137 yards in 28 
carries. 
</P>
<P>
 When Jones returned, Phillips' playing time was limited, but he still finished 
the season with 92 carries for 508 yards and four touchdowns, then added a 
touchdown in the Orange Bowl against national champion Florida State. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones opted to try his hand at the NFL after his junior season, and Phillips 
beat out Benning for the starting spot during spring drills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he took his game to a new level in the spring," Coach Tom Osborne 
said. "Right now he shows the potential, I think, to rank with some of the 
better running backs we've had here, and we've had some fine ones here." 
</P>
<P>
 For low-key Osborne, that is being effusive. Phillips has joined an I-back 
legacy that includes Roger Craig, Mike Rozier, Jarvis Redwine and others who 
went on to the NFL. 
</P>
<P>
 The haul has been long, and none of the yards he has gotten at Nebraska have 
been as tough as those in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Pagone and Zane) kept me on a straight line," Phillips said. "I remember 
when they were getting me in at Baldwin Park, Coach told me, 'We've gone 
through a lot of trouble here. I hope you're worth it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He has been, and that's something else Pagone will tell Phillips at dinner 
tonight in Lincoln, Neb.

PACIFIC 10 CONFERENCE FOOTBALL / DAN HAFNER; TOP QUARTERBACKS DISAPPOINT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After two weeks of the 1994 football season, some are beginning to wonder what 
has happened to all those great Pacific 10 Conference quarterbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the preseason hype focused on about a half dozen outstanding 
quarterbacks who were expected to lead their teams to big years. 
</P>
<P>
 Although several teams have played only once, only three of the 10 conference 
teams have unblemished records. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the three with 2-0 marks, only UCLA, with Wayne Cook, has one of the highly 
rated quarterbacks. And Cook was anything but dominant in the Bruins' 
victories. Although he passed for almost 500 yards, Cook has only two touchdown 
passes. 
</P>
<P>
 The passer who probably has come closest to living up to the ballyhoo is 
Stanford's Steve Stenstrom. Despite Stenstrom's sensational performance at 
Northwestern, the Cardinal had to settle for a 41-41 tie. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom overcame two of his fumbles, completing 25 of 38 passes for 374 
yards and a touchdown. He also drove Stanford into position for the short 
field-goal attempt that failed at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the season, Stanford Coach Bill Walsh said, "Steve Stenstrom is the 
best college passer in the nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's lack of a running attack has put added pressure on Stenstrom, but 
sophomore Mike Mitchell ran for 136 yards against Northwestern, 10 more than he 
gained all last season. He also was credited with a touchdown, although he 
dropped the ball a stride before he reached the goal line. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than Stenstrom, there were some major disappointments at quarterback 
last week. Oregon Coach Rich Brooks maintains that if Danny O'Neil played in 
one of the population centers, instead of in Eugene, he would be regarded as 
one of the real stars. Pardon the Hawaii Rainbows if they aren't buying that. 
</P>
<P>
 After passing for four touchdowns in a rout of Portland State, O'Neil was 
supposed to lead the Ducks to their second victory Saturday night at Honolulu. 
</P>
<P>
 But with O'Neil suffering from flu and hardly able to practice all week, the 
Ducks were trounced, 36-16. The Rainbows intercepted three of O'Neil's passes, 
Junior Faavae returning one 44 yards for a touchdown in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil will get a chance Saturday to rebound when he returns home to play 
Utah. He will have to do it without wide receiver Kory Murphy, who is out for 
the season with a spinal injury. 
</P>
<P>
 When Dave Barr was sound last season, the California Bears were unbeatable. It 
was when he was out or hampered by injury that the Bears lost their four games. 
Barr regained his best form to lead Cal to a 37-3 rout of Iowa in the Alamo 
Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr was in good health Saturday at San Diego State, but Cal lost, 22-20, on a 
field goal as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr, who completed 68% of his passes last season, was 21 of 34 for 242 yards, 
with one touchdown and a costly interception. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this game the Aztecs had lost 17 in a row to Pac-10 schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Preseason pick for the best quarterback was USC's Rob Johnson. Many expected 
him to go in the first round of next year's NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
 But in his first two games, Johnson has played poorly. He has been a tentative 
passer, waiting too long and getting sacked too often. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Trojans rallied to defeat Washington, it was the running game, not 
Johnson's passing, that brought the Trojans from behind. When Penn State 
overwhelmed USC early, Johnson could do nothing to help his team get back in 
the game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Washington made a smart move last spring when it made an all-out effort to get 
running star Napoleon Kaufman to return for his final collegiate season. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision seems to have benefited the Huskies as well as Kaufman. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams ineligible for postseason play often have little incentive. The Huskies, 
on probation for misuses in their summer jobs program among other NCAA 
violations, found a way to give their team a reason to play by building Kaufman 
into a Heisman Trophy contender. 
</P>
<P>
 And Kaufman stands to make a lot of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake about it, this is Kaufman's team. Under ordinary 
circumstances, as soon as the Huskies clinched Saturday's victory over Ohio 
State, Kaufman would have left the game for good. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, coaches kept him in until he gained a personal-high 211 yards. The 
Huskies figure the first four games against four of the nation's best teams 
would give Kaufman the exposure he needed. The performance against an Ohio 
State team known for its defense was a great start. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman was somewhat battered and bruised after rushing 58 times in the first 
two games. But he gets this week off and should be ready for the next two big 
ones -- at Miami and home against UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other two unbeaten teams, Arizona and Washington State, don't have 
quarterbacks considered among the elite, though the Cougars are expecting big 
things from redshirt sophomore Chad Davis, who set state career passing marks 
at three Southern California high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona and Washington State rank one-two in the conference in total defense 
with the Wildcats the leaders at 222 yards per game. The Cougars have given up 
only 39 yards rushing in two games, best in the nation.

BASEBALL '94: GOING, GOING . . . GONE; CLINTON QUESTIONS THE ANTITRUST 
EXEMPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL RICHTER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lamenting the premature end of a promising baseball season, President Clinton 
said Wednesday that the sport's antitrust exemption should be re-examined "if 
this has just turned into another business in America." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton told reporters that, with the World Series called off, and if "we have 
ended what could have been the best baseball season in 50 years . . . I don't 
see how we can avoid a serious examination of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton added, "I don't want to give a definitive answer (on the antitrust 
exemption) at this moment, for the simple reason that I have not had time to 
study it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor, he said, has he received any advice from the Justice Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also said that his Administration should get some credit for trying to 
solve the dispute between baseball's players and owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might say, you know, we tried," he said, noting that the Administration had 
mobilized the Federal Mediation Service, as well as Labor Secretary Robert B. 
Reich. The Administration did everything it could do, Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball players have argued that the antitrust exemption has unreasonably 
restrained free-market competition and held down players' salaries. PAUL 
RICHTER

COMMENTARY; BASEBALL '94: GOING, GOING . . . GONE; BASEBALL'S UNLIKELY LEADER 
IS ALSO ITS GOAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE KUPPER, TIMES ASSISTANT SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is axiomatic in baseball that the game survives in spite of the people who 
run it. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time? Can baseball survive even this?  
</P>
<P>
 No playoffs. No World Series. Most likely no spring training next season. 
Possibly no next season. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a heavy load for the grand old game to shoulder. There are those 
predicting that major league baseball, as we know it, will stagger under that 
burden -- stagger, collapse and die. 
</P>
<P>
 Time will tell, of course, but there is no disputing that baseball today 
stands at the edge of the abyss. 
</P>
<P>
 And who has led it there? 
</P>
<P>
 It was that little old Milwaukee elf, Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
 Bud Selig, head of the Brewers, acting commissioner of baseball, the man so 
obsessed with evening out baseball-market inequities that he apparently is 
willing to tear down the game to save it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wait a minute. Bud Selig? Milwaukee? 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee has a lot going for it but much of the country is wondering, as 
Dodger pitcher Orel Hershiser so succinctly put it the other day, "How is it 
that the center of power is in Milwaukee and not New York or Los Angeles?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fair question. How did car dealer Joe Schmo from Milwaukee -- the 
rumpled-looking guy in front of you in line at the bank, your pretty smart but 
kind of nerdy neighbor -- emerge as baseball's Mr. Big? Aren't commissioners 
supposed to be suave, glib-tongued guys with impressive tans and quick, 
plausible answers to any and all questions? 
</P>
<P>
 Ask Selig a question about baseball and he scrunches his face into a grimace 
before launching into a lecture on fiscal responsibility, economic realities 
and financial inequities. He pleads poverty at the drop of a bat, then mutters 
when independent studies show the Brewers to be in modest good health. He is 
thin-skinned and he whines a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is the power these days. And he wouldn't be if his fellow owners didn't 
approve of where he is leading them. And he is leading them where he honestly 
thinks baseball has to go. He may be misguided, but he is sincere. Because if 
there is one thing he loves, it is baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 He is happiest at the ballpark, fouling the press box with his cheap, 
plastic-tipped cigarillos, trading insults with sportswriters, acting more like 
the punch-press operators out in the bleachers than a major league owner. 
</P>
<P>
 He loves his city, he loves his ballclub, he loves his players. There isn't 
much question that what went down Wednesday tore him up inside. He will miss 
the World Series as much as -- maybe more than -- baseball's most rabid fans. 
</P>
<P>
 But Selig is also a businessman, which means he is bottom-line conscious. In 
his case, extremely bottom-line conscious. He is also given to obsessions, and 
that's partly why he is the power in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 If you ask Selig to do something, and he agrees to do it, you can rest assured 
that he will do it thoroughly and to the best of his considerable ability. The 
man works like crazy and tough jobs don't discourage him. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting baseball back in Milwaukee after the Braves had carpet-bagged down to 
Atlanta was a tough job. It took five years of being ignored and shunted aside 
by baseball but he swallowed it all, kept on plugging and, when the Seattle 
Pilots went bankrupt after a year, had another ballclub for his town. 
</P>
<P>
 And when baseball began asking him to do things beyond the scope of his own 
club, he showed the same tenacity. They asked him to find a commissioner to 
succeed Bowie Kuhn. He gave them Peter Ueberroth, the hottest name in the 
sports-business world at the time. It wasn't his fault that Ueberroth led them 
down the garden path to that collusion mess. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ueberroth left, he gave them Bart Giamatti, the scholar who threw gambler 
Pete Rose out of baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 When Giamatti died unexpectedly, he gave them Fay Vincent, Giamatti's good 
friend and deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 And when Vincent proved too strong for the owners' tastes, Selig canned him 
and gave them himself. 
</P>
<P>
 He serves on more baseball boards and committees than any other owner. He has 
been doing, and is willing to continue doing, the things baseball wants, the 
things other owners don't want to mess with, the things he believes will be 
best for baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the center of baseball's power is in Milwaukee, and not New York or 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, there is an apparent conflict. He represents the low end on 
baseball's money ladder. The New York Yankees will be the New York Yankees as 
long as there is baseball -- oops, forgot, there is no baseball -- but the 
Milwaukee Brewers enjoy no such security. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball might have done better to pick an owner with a little less at stake 
to lead the troops through a labor dispute. But baseball didn't do that. 
Baseball picked Selig. And baseball has backed his every play, so evidently his 
work is appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 But how ironic it is that Selig, the man who saved baseball for Milwaukee, now 
stands to go down as the man who wrecked it for the rest of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 How ironic and how sad. For Selig. For baseball. For everybody who cares.

BASEBALL '94: GOING, GOING . . . GONE; THE ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A look at the dividing lines in baseball's labor dispute:  
</P>
<P>
 WHAT THE OWNERS WANT 
</P>
<P>
 * Revenue sharing on a 50-50 basis, with $1 billion guaranteed to the players 
over seven years if revenues don't decrease. Salaries and benefits for players 
currently amount to 58% of revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 * After a four-year phase-in period in the seven-year agreement, clubs 
couldn't have payrolls more than 110% of the major league average or less than 
84% of the average. 
</P>
<P>
 * Elimination of salary arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Free agency threshold would drop from six years of major league service to 
four, but clubs would be able to keep their free agents by matching the highest 
offer until the players have six years' service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Escalating scale of minimum salaries for players with less than four years' 
major league service, although they could sign for more than the minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 * Implementation of the agreement clubs made with each other in January to 
increase revenue that is shared among teams. WHAT THE PLAYERS WANT 
</P>
<P>
 FIRST PROPOSAL 
</P>
<P>
 * Eliminate the restriction on repeat free agency within a five-year span if a 
player's club offers salary arbitration at the end of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 * Reduce the threshold for salary arbitration to two years of major league 
service, which was its level in 1974-86. It currently is three years plus the 
top 17% of the players with between two and three years of major league 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase minimum salary from $109,000 to $175,000-$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * Increase pension levels for players who played before 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 SECOND PROPOSAL 
</P>
<P>
 * A "tax" of 1 1/2% of revenue on the top 16 clubs by revenue and a "tax" of 1 
1/2% of payrolls on the top 16 clubs by payroll. The money would be 
redistributed to the bottom 10 clubs in each category. 
</P>
<P>
 * Home teams share 25% of ticket money with visiting teams. American League 
home teams currently share 20% and National League home teams share 43 cents 
per ticket over $1, about 4%.

BASEBALL '94: GOING, GOING . . . GONE; TV; SEASON'S END HAS LITTLE IMPACT ON 
NETWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Our fall will be no different than the last four," an NBC executive quipped 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 It will be business as it was at ABC and NBC, now that the baseball season has 
been canceled. Both networks, which were without baseball the last four years 
anyway, will simply revert to regular prime-time programming to fill the 
baseball void. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC, which had four regular-season, prime-time telecasts before the strike, 
was to have televised the new, best-of-five first tier playoffs Oct. 4-9 and 
the World Series beginning Oct. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC, which televised the All-Star game on July 12, was to have carried the two 
league championship series beginning Oct. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The financial impact on both networks will be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 After CBS had claimed at least $170 million in losses over the four-year 
period of its $1.06-billion contract with baseball that expired at the end of 
the 1993 season, baseball restructured how it does business with national 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baseball Network was established in May, 1993, as a three-way partnership 
among major league baseball, ABC and NBC. Each contributed a reported $10 
million in start-up costs on a six-year agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 No rights fee was paid, so ABC and NBC can lose only part of the $10 million 
each invested. But those loses could still be made up in future years. 
</P>
<P>
 Because major league baseball was taking all the risk with this new venture, 
it was scheduled to get 88% of the profits the first two years of the 
agreement, and 80% later on. The remaining 12% the first two years was to be 
split between ABC and NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Aug. 1, $130 million worth of advertising revenue had been generated by 
the Baseball Network, a source said, with another $35 million expected before 
the start of postseason play. But the Aug. 12 strike stopped sales. 
</P>
<P>
 No one at the networks is saying so, but the resumption of the season probably 
would not have been welcomed. ABC's prime-time lineup has been gaining on No. 1 
CBS and is expected to win the ratings battle this season. NBC is No. 3 but 
coming off a good week. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball, particularly after the strike, certainly could not have generated 
the same ratings or revenue as regular prime-time programming. 
</P>
<P>
 But before the strike, things were actually going better than expected for the 
new Baseball Network. 
</P>
<P>
 The rating for NBC's All-Star telecast was a 15.7, the highest in three years. 
And ABC's four regular-season, prime-time telecasts, featuring regionalized 
coverage, averaged 7.1, up from the 3.5 CBS had been averaging for 
regular-season telecasts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sales revenue was also exceeding expectations. Experts predicted $170 million 
in advertising revenue for the regular season and playoffs, but it appeared the 
Baseball Network was on its way to $165 million for postseason play alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball will lose that $165 million or so, not the networks. With the 
networks, it was a case of nothing ventured so nothing lost. 
</P>
<P>
 So what becomes of the money baseball lost?  
</P>
<P>
 "Beer companies and other sponsors figure to shift the money they're not 
spending on baseball to football and other sports," said John Mansell, senior 
analyst for Paul Kagan Associates, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Locally, John Reardon, station manager for Channel 5, which carries the 
Dodgers and Angels, said the loss of baseball has affected his station, 
although he could not estimate how much. Reardon said some of the lost baseball 
spots can be moved around to King telecasts and news broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just hope this all can be resolved before next year," he said.

BASEBALL '94: GOING, GOING . . . GONE; ENDING LEAVES MANY QUESTIONS, UNPLEASANT 
ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Some questions and answers on the termination of the baseball season: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Why cancel the season now? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Acting commissioner Bud Selig determined that there was no time left 
to play a meaningful number of games before the season's scheduled end. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why couldn't the players have finished the season and then gone on strike? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The players, having been stalled in negotiations for a year and a half, 
believed that the owners were planning to arbitrarily impose a salary cap after 
the World Series. In the absence of negotiations, a strike was the only tool at 
their disposal and they figured that a strike in November, when there are no 
games, was pointless. So they went on strike in August, hoping to force 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why did the players wait until August to strike? Why couldn't they have 
done that in April? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The players believed that by threatening postseason play and the $140 
million in broadcasting revenue, owners would drop their demand for a salary 
cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happens to the World Series? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The playoffs and World Series are canceled. There will be no American 
League, National League or World Series champions listed in the record books 
for 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why not just delay the World Series until a settlement is reached? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Cold weather would interfere with the games and the owners will not play 
postseason games at neutral sites, such as warm-weather cities and those with 
domed ballparks. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will happen to tickets for remaining games? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Individual seats for the Dodgers and Angels can be returned for refunds to 
the places where they were bought. The Angels and Dodgers already have sent 
cards to their season ticket-holders, asking them if they want a refund for 
games missed or credit toward season tickets next season. Ticket-holders with 
questions should call the Dodger or Angel ticket office. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happens to the postseason awards? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Baseball Writers Assn. of America will present its annual awards. At 
this season's All-Star game, the baseball writers chose to vote on the awards 
even if the season were shortened by a strike. According to Jack Lang, 
president of the BBWAA, ballots will be mailed today and winners will be 
announced in mid-October. The BBWAA picks the most valuable player, the Cy 
Young Award winner, the rookie of the year and the manager of the year in each 
league. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will there be batting and pitching champions?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The players leading when the strike began will be recognized as the 
champions. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Gwynn of San Diego is the National League batting champion with a .394 
average, the highest since Ted Williams hit .406 in 1941 and the best in the 
league since Bill Terry hit .401 in 1930. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Williams of the San Francisco Giants won his first NL home run 
championship and led the majors with 43. He was on a pace for 61 when the 
strike started. Jeff Bagwell of the Houston Astros led the NL in runs batted in 
with 116. 
</P>
<P>
 In pitching, Greg Maddux of the Atlanta Braves led the NL and the majors with 
a 1.56 earned-run average. Maddux finished tied with Ken Hill of Montreal for 
the lead in victories with 16, led the majors with 10 complete games and tied 
for the NL lead with three shutouts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the American League, Ken Griffey Jr. of Seattle won his first home run 
title with 40. Paul O'Neill of the Yankees hit .359 for his first batting 
championship and Kirby Puckett of the Twins led the league in RBIs with 112. 
</P>
<P>
 The league leader in victories was the Yankees' Jimmy Key with 17. Oakland's 
Steve Ontiveros was the ERA champion at 2.65. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why do the owners want a salary cap? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Negotiator Richard Ravitch says a salary cap is needed because it will 
allow revenue sharing by the owners. He says large-market and small-market 
clubs can't agree to share revenue unless there is a reduction in the revenue 
paid to players. It will also help ensure competitive balance by keeping 
big-market teams from signing all the best free agents, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has the World Series ever been canceled before?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The World Series was not played in 1904, in part, because Manager John 
McGraw of the New York Giants said the National League champion was too good to 
play the AL champion Boston Pilgrims. The Series resumed the next year and had 
not been canceled since. 
</P>
<P>
 It was even played during World Wars I and II, although in 1918, President 
Wilson ordered the season halted early and the World Series started the first 
week of September. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, President Franklin D. Roosevelt said that America needed 
baseball and that the games should be played. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happens to the 1995 season? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Although the rest of the 1994 season has been canceled, the strike 
continues. If no settlement is reached, the '95 season may be delayed, or 
canceled as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The players, especially free agents, will be uncertain about where they will 
play next season, and all but the approximately 180 players who already are 
signed for 1995 will be wondering about their income once play resumes. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners figure to have difficulty selling season tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When will negotiations resume? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is nothing scheduled. Union representative Donald Fehr said he 
expects to be traveling next week for regional player meetings and for a Sept. 
22 Congressional hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Could the players start their own league? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Agent Dick Moss is trying to set up an eight-team league for next season, 
and some of them may be able to play there. Among proposed cities for such a 
league are Buffalo, N.Y.; New Orleans and St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about bets that were placed with sports books in Las Vegas? 
</P>
<P>
 A: When Vegas oddsmakers placed the over-under line for regular-season 
victories, they also posted a disclaimer that teams have to play 160 games to 
be eligible. According to Vinny Magliulo, director of the race and sports book 
at Caesars Palace, because 160 games were not played, the money will be 
refunded.

BASEBALL '94: GOING, GOING. . .GONE; 'WE STUNK,' BAVASI SAYS, IN ASSESSING 
ANGELS' PERFORMANCE; BASEBALL: GENERAL MANAGER HAS BEEN BUSY PLOTTING CHANGES 
FOR NEXT SEASON, TRYING TO AVOID ANOTHER DISMAL SHOWING. 
</P>

<P>
 Bill Bavasi stood off to the side of the Angel clubhouse, nervously shuffling 
his feet, wincing in anticipation of the speech his boss was about to deliver. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi, the first-year general manager of the Angels, braced himself for pain 
and humiliation. Angel owner Gene Autry stepped forward and was addressing the 
team Aug. 10 in what turned out to be the final game of the 1994 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected him to blast us," Bavasi remembers, "and I knew if he ripped us to 
high hell, we would deserve everything he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, Bavasi stood with his mouth agape, listening to Autry actually tell 
the Angels that he appreciated everything they did this season. OK, maybe they 
didn't accomplish nearly what they wanted, but deep down in their hearts, Autry 
said he knew they agonized just as much as he did over their failures. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry finished speaking, thanked his team one final time for its effort, and 
stepped back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never felt like such a loser in my life," Bavasi said. "I just felt so 
awful for what happened this season. That speech brought everyone to their 
knees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew then, just what it meant, when people say, 'Let's win one for the 
Cowboy.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And believe me, what happened this year, isn't going to happen again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never wanted to win so bad in my entire life." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi concedes he actually envisioned winning the World Series this season. 
He dreamed of sitting in his suite as the first-year general manager, watching 
the final out, and standing in the clubhouse drenched with champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Buzzie Bavasi, who won four World Series as general manager of the 
Dodgers, told him that there's no feeling more beautiful in the world, and Bill 
wanted that. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I assessed this team back in spring training," Bavasi said, "I actually 
thought this would be a .500 team. And when I assessed the rest of the 
division, I knew that might be good enough. I realized Chicago was by far and 
away the best team in our league, but once you get to the playoffs, anything's 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I can honestly tell you that I didn't expect this. I never thought we 
would be this bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is, we stunk." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels finished the season with a 47-68 record, the second-worst winning 
percentage in franchise history. 
</P>
<P>
 No team in the American League was worse. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Padres saved the Angels from the worst record in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thankful we weren't getting ripped like we could have been this year," 
Bavasi said. "It's been an amazingly positive season for as bad as it's been. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why when our players criticized our fans this year, I couldn't 
disagree with them more. I was around here in '79, '82 and '86, and these fans 
respond when you play well. But if you don't give them anything to cheer about, 
it's your own damn fault. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look at our record. Come on, what did they have to cheer about? You take this 
team and put it in New York, and then it's, 'Heads up, boys.' You'd really see 
something then. They should have been thanking their lucky stars for the way we 
were treated by our fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we played, we deserved to get verbally nuked." 
</P>
<P>
 The only redeeming aspect of the Angels' season was that they played to the 
level of their competition in the American League West. Everyone was rotten. 
The Angels finished only 5 1/2 games behind the first-place Texas Rangers in 
the AL West. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Billy the other day," said Peter Bavasi, former general manager at 
Toronto and Cleveland and Bill's older brother, "that when people ask how your 
first ballclub finished, just say, 'We finished 5 1/2 games back.' 
</P>
<P>
 "People will think, 'Oh, what a great year.' 
</P>
<P>
 Billy told me, 'Hey, not a bad idea, I never thought about that one." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Buzzie: "Leave it to Peter to think of that one. But knowing Billy, he'd 
never, ever say that. He knows what kind of season it was, and really, he took 
this a lot harder than I ever did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, he didn't have Koufax or Drysdale or Furillo or Snyder or Hodges 
or Jackie Robinson, either." 
</P>
<P>
 "When you look what he had to work with, he did as fine a job as anybody under 
the circumstances. He didn't have the money, and he didn't have the players. I 
think he would have done a real fine job if he had the wherewithal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, if he has the money, he'll know how to use it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel player payroll was $23.3 million in 1994, lowest in the American 
League. Yet, if everything goes according to plan, ownership may provide Bavasi 
nearly $27 million for the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 They opened negotiations with Chili Davis on a two- or three-year contract 
that will pay him about $3.5 million to $4 million a season. They vow to start 
the '95 season with a veteran closer, and could easily renew talks with the 
Minnesota Twins about Rick Aguilera. They want a right-handed starter; no, not 
left-handed free agent Jim Abbott. And they want another power-hitter in the 
lineup, either at third base or first base. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the most frustrating thing for Billy is to think about the team he 
could have had," Buzzie Bavasi said. "They'd have a better club with just the 
guys they got rid of than the guys they have. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just think of the club if they had kept (Bryan) Harvey, (Wally) Joyner and 
Abbott. It would be a pennant-winner today." 
</P>
<P>
 It matters little to Bavasi, who refuses to waste time dwelling on the past. 
He's not going to criticize his predecessor, Whitey Herzog, for the moves he 
made. And he's not going to torment himself knowing that he's paying $2.9 
million to a third baseman (Gary Gaetti) who's no longer with the team, and 
still owes $2 million next season to a pitcher (Joe Magrane) who has been 
rendered useless. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, he's using those blunders to his advantage, realizing that he can 
ill afford to make mistakes that a $40-million payroll can cover up. 
</P>
<P>
 It was back in spring training when he was on the verge of trading first 
baseman J.T. Snow to the New York Mets for pitcher Anthony Young. In fact, if 
Young had not pulled a groin muscle in a spring-training start, Bavasi says, 
"The deal is done." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi backs out of the deal, Young is traded to the Chicago Cubs, and today, 
Young is recovering from major elbow surgery that will keep him sidelined 
through the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, there were the free-agent acquisitions he tried to make during the 
off-season. He out-bid the Colorado Rockies for starter Mike Harkey, and the 
Atlanta Braves for reliever Gregg Olson. Fortunately for Bavasi, neither took 
his offer, and they both turned out to be free-agent busts. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Yankee General Manager Gene Michael had a trade worked out April 1 that 
would have rocked the baseball world. He was sending Snow and minor-league 
prospects Ryan Hancock and Jeff Schmidt to the Yankees for Abbott. The Yankees 
were then going to turn around and send Snow and third-base prospect Russ Davis 
to the Twins for Aguilera. The press release was typed and ready to be 
distributed. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael called back that evening. Sorry, owner George Steinbrenner nixed the 
trade. It was over, and the Angels wound up saving the $2.9 million it would 
have cost to pay Abbott. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that we did the right thing, but we got lucky," Bavasi said. "That's 
all it was, luck." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of making the major trade that would brand the Bavasi regime, and 
forgetting that he was the man who brought Bo Jackson back to Southern 
California and signed four players to multiyear contracts, Bavasi instead will 
be remembered by the public as the man who fired Manager Buck Rodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 If trying to trade a player as popular as Snow was bold, what do you call a 
move in which you fire the most identifiable Angel, who was adored by fans and 
the media? 
</P>
<P>
 "My approach from the start was to make it work," Bavasi said. "Buck was not 
the manager I hired, but I thought I could make it work. I hate those general 
managers that come to a team, and just start firing everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it just wasn't working, and there wasn't the communication that was 
needed. It became apparent it was something I had to do. The only reason I 
would have even delayed a decision like that is for political reasons and 
publicity reasons. I'm proud to say we didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect to be praised for it, but I've certainly never regretted it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Angel President Richard Brown: "That move took a lot of guts. He made 
every attempt for it to work with Buck, and when it was time to make a 
decision, he did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like he was saying, 'If you're going to judge me, judge me with my 
team and my manager. Don't judge me with a manager I don't want and a team I 
don't want. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe me, you're not going to see the same team next year." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be plenty of changes for 1995, beginning with virtually a complete 
overhaul of the bullpen, and perhaps as many as three players in the everyday 
lineup. Manager Marcel Lachemann and Bavasi already have been plotting strategy 
for the entire organization, implementing a uniform scouting system, and 
ensuring that all the coaches are accountable for specific aspects of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the first time since I've been here," Brown said, "I can say it's a joy 
for the front office to work with one another. There's mutual respect. You 
can't expect players to act like a team on the field when you're not a team in 
the front office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finally, we are a team." 
</P>
<P>
 Bavasi and assistant Tim Mead also have gone to great extremes to bridge the 
gap between the front office and players. Bavasi visited Gary and Janee 
DiSarcina at the hospital when they had their first baby this summer. Mead 
stayed until the wee hours of the morning with Allison Leiter, Mark Leiter's 
wife, when their baby died in April. They stayed with coach Jimmie Reese the 
night he died in July. Bavasi even presented all of the players personalized 
money clips before the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel players, for goodness sakes, responded by taking time out Friday in 
the middle of a vicious strike to present Bavasi with a gift. Rod Carew, 
hitting coach, gave Bavasi an encased lineup card and game ball of the Angels' 
opening-day victory, autographed by the entire team. The inscription read: 
"Bill, congratulations on your first win as general manager of the California 
Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 "From: The team." 
</P>
<P>
 "Players get generalized, managers get generalized," Mead said, "but Bill 
Bavasi is the complete person." 
</P>
<P>
 Buzzie Bavasi, who once occupied the same office as his son, shakes his head 
in wonderment. The game has drastically changed, but here is his son, once 
again carrying on the Bavasi tradition, only in his own style. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's unbelievable how this game works today," Buzzie Bavasi said. "We're 
paying .250 hitters a million dollars a year. We used to release .250 hitters 
when I was with the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "God bless him, I know I couldn't do it today, not the way the game's changed. 
I'd either be in jail for hitting a guy in the nose or commit suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 "But with Billy, well, he's got the perfect temperament. 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter's interest was always on the business side of baseball. But not Billy. 
He has the passion. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loves this game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know something, he loves this game as much as Gene Autry."

SALSA PRACTICE MORE THAN A KICK TO LANGSTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mark Langston zeroed in on his target, reared back and fired a high, hard one 
. . . into the back of the net. 
</P>
<P>
 With the baseball season canceled, the Angels' left-hander practiced with the 
Salsa on Wednesday night at Cal State Fullerton.While he looked like, well, a 
baseball player playing soccer, he did show flashes of ability, and even 
managed to sneak a shot past goalie Mario Jimenez during a one-on-one drill. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was fun," Langston said. "I was in way over my head, but it was a good 
time. Being on the field with world-class players was a thrill." 
</P>
<P>
 But Langston, who hasn't played competitive soccer since he played for San 
Jose State in 1980, said he wouldn't be comfortable playing in an American 
Professional Soccer League game for the third-place Salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way," he said. "I'd be a fool to think I could walk on the field 
with these guys. They are pros and I have too much respect to think I could 
play with them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Salsa Coach Rick Davis was a little more enthusiastic about Langston's 
soccer career. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a big believer that a professional athlete is capable of many things," 
Davis said. "The fact (Langston) has an interest in soccer tells me he's worth 
taking a look at. We'll take a look and see if he can help us get into the 
playoffs."

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; HENLEY BOND REQUEST DENIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge denied a request Wednesday from cornerback Darryl Henley to 
use part of the cash deposit he has already posted on his travel bond toward 
the bond he must provide the court while he is in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley had already cleared one hurdle of his bail situation when the Rams 
agreed to post a $2-million bond on his behalf so he could travel to road 
games.But Henley had to provide a $200,000 cash deposit as part of that amount. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, U.S. District Court Judge Gary L. Taylor raised Henley's local bail 
amount from $200,000 to $600,000, which applies to the time that Henley spends 
within the Central District of California. As part of Henley's original 
$200,000, he had to provide the court with $20,000 in cash, or 10% of the 
total. 
</P>
<P>
 When Taylor raised the bail to $600,000, Henley was required to post $40,000 
more in cash. But Taylor denied Henley's request to apply $40,000 of the 
$200,000 travel bond to the new amount needed for local bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense makes this request because Henley has already deposited almost 
all of his after-tax salary with the court in order to meet the conditions of 
the travel bond," wrote Gerald L. Chaleff, one of Henley's attorneys. "Henley's 
available resources have therefore already been substantially consumed by the 
conditions of his two bail arrangements." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor denied the request but gave no reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaleff said he is convinced that Henley can raise the money in some other 
way. Henley has until Friday to come up with the cash, but Chaleff is expected 
to request a deadline extension. MARK PLATTE

OREGON RECEIVER QUITTING AFTER SPINAL INJURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oregon wide receiver Kory Murphy has accepted the advice of his doctors and 
given up football after suffering a spinal injury in last Saturday's loss in 
Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy was trying to catch a pass from Danny O'Neil when he was hit by Hawaii 
defensive backs Zach Odom and Marlon Smiley. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy was motionless for several minutes before being taken by ambulance to a 
hospital, where he was found to have a bruised spinal cord and compound 
dislocation of a finger on his left hand. 
</P>
<P>
 He returned to Eugene on Monday evening after spending two nights in the 
hospital and announced his decision to leave the game Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do love being a football player, but, obviously, the risk is a little bit 
too much," Murphy, 21, said. "I love football, but I love life a whole lot 
more."

 Dwane Casey, a central figure in Kentucky's 1989 basketball scandal, was named 
an assistant coach with the Seattle SuperSonics. He replaces Bob Kloppenburg, 
who becomes vice president of personnel and scouting. 
</P>
<P>
 The SuperSonics also announced the hiring of Rick Sund, former Dallas Maverick 
vice president, as a consultant to General Manager Wally Walker. 
</P>
<P>
 At Kentucky, Casey was linked to a recruiting scandal when he was an assistant 
under then-Coach Eddie Sutton. Casey's name was on the return address of a 
package sent to the father of Los Angeles Fairfax High star Chris Mills. 
Employees of the air-freight company said the package broke open, revealing 
$1,000. The NCAA concluded that the school had sent the package. Miscellany

IDAHO SQUEAKS PAST NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were plenty of long faces among members of the Cal State Northridge 
women's volleyball team after a five-game loss to Idaho at Matador Gymnasium on 
Wednesday, but first-year Coach Lian Kang Lu liked what he saw. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Idaho's 9-15, 15-8, 15-10, 13-15, 15-12 victory was Northridge's 
fourth loss in five matches, Lu was particularly pleased with the way the 
Matadors (4-4) played after outside hitter Rene Goth was forced to leave the 
match late in the first game with a sprained right ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this situation, we played very good," Lu said. "I don't care whether we 
win or lose, as long as we fight, and tonight we did." 
</P>
<P>
 Goth, a 5-foot-10 freshman from Buena High, was making her first start because 
Stephanie Pfau was ill. 
</P>
<P>
 When Goth left, she was replaced by Erin Balderama. 
</P>
<P>
 Balderama has played solidly this season as a back-row substitute, but at 5-7, 
she was giving away as much as six inches in height to Idaho's attackers along 
the front row. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Vandals (8-1) failed to exploit the mismatch in the last part of 
Game 1, they frequently took advantage thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Idaho is a very good team," Lu said. "They are (defending) Big Sky Conference 
champions and they take advantage of situations when they get the chance." 
</P>
<P>
 After losing the second and third games, Northridge trailed for most of the 
fourth game, but fought back from a 10-8 deficit to win, 15-13. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge tied the score, 12-12, and after 14 consecutive sideouts, took a 
14-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After several sideouts, the Matadors won the game when Idaho was whistled for 
a lifted ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The lead see-sawed back and forth for the first half of Game 5 -- which was 
played under the rally point scoring system -- but Idaho outscored Northridge, 
5-1, during one stretch to take a 12-8 lead and the Matadors couldn't get 
closer than two after that. 
</P>
<P>
 Missy Clements had 24 kills -- with a .333 hitting percentage -- for 
Northridge and teammate Aimee Stone contributed 20 kills and a match-high 19 
digs.

SYLMAR PUT ON 2 YEARS' PROBATION; FOOTBALL: SOME AREA COACHES CALL PENALTY FOR 
VIOLATIONS NOTHING MORE THAN SLAP ON THE WRIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Sylmar High football team was placed on probation for two calendar years 
Wednesday by the City Section rules committee and will forfeit two practice 
days for violating two Interscholastic Athletics Committee rules last month, 
City Commissioner Barbara Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the second probation in little more than a year for Sylmar, a City 4-A 
semifinalist the past three seasons and 4-A champion in 1992. And just another 
proverbial slap on the wrist, according to some disappointed area City coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Probation came as no surprise to Sylmar Coach Jeff Engilman, who was thankful 
that his players will be allowed to participate in the playoffs this season. If 
Sylmar commits another violation while on probation, the program could be 
banned from the playoffs, "or worse," Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expected probation," said Engilman, who offered to resign if it would save 
the season for the players. "When you set yourself up, like I do -- and I was 
wrong -- you expect this. I'm just very, very happy they didn't punish the 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar scrimmaged Pierce College in an informal passing game Aug. 9, violating 
two IAC rules. City teams were not allowed to participate in intrasquad 
scrimmages after Aug. 1. Additionally, high school teams are not permitted to 
compete against players who do not meet the CIF age requirement. Students who 
turn 19 on or before Aug. 31 are ineligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Engilman admits that the game took place, he insists that he did not 
know it was a violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Area coaches expressed disgust and resentment about what they described as a 
lenient punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knew that was gonna be what happened, you know, ho-hum," Reseda 
Coach Joel Schaeffer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schaeffer is among many who feel that teams which break rules repeatedly never 
receive enough punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sylmar (1-0), which beat Kennedy, 16-14, in a season opener last week, was on 
probation last season for practicing on a holiday, which violated an IAC rule. 
However, that probation period ended when Sylmar's 1993 season was complete in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiege, who assumed her post shortly after Sylmar received its 1993 probation, 
was among nine committee members who decided on the punishment. Fiege is 
confident that the prescribed punishment fits the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think two years probation is sending a message because we usually just 
(prescribe) one year," Fiege said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probation on probation. What is that?" Schaeffer said. "The message to 
me is that you are gonna get two or three probations before anything happens to 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Grant Coach Bill Foster: "It's a sad thing when people are in outright 
violation of the rules and given probation over and over again."

GIRLS' VOLLEYBALL PREVIEW; NEWBURY PARK TAKES AIM AT THOUSAND OAKS AND LEAGUE 
CHAMPIONSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The instant Kari Norberg received her schedule for the 1994 girls' volleyball 
season, the Newbury Park High setter highlighted the Sept. 29 match against 
Marmonte League rival Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 For Norberg and her teammates, the match is more than a meeting of two 
contenders for the league championship. The Panthers want to show their old 
coach what he left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Robert Haar left Newbury Park to become coach at Thousand Oaks, a 
traditional league power. 
</P>
<P>
 Haar switched schools for a better teaching opportunity in the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District but might regret his decision for at least one night 
later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's going to be a little extra incentive," Norberg said. "We've been 
together for three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Haar's replacement, Kevin Judd, stresses an upbeat, never-say-die approach. 
The players have responded.  
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers opened the season last weekend by winning the Calabasas 
Tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 In the semifinals, Newbury Park trailed Burroughs, 13-9, before rallying for 
six consecutive points to close out the match. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've decided as a team we're not going to lose even if we're down, 14-0," 
Norberg said. "I don't think we could have come back like that last year." 
</P>
<P>
 Haar left Judd, the junior varsity coach at Newbury Park last year, with 
enough experienced players for Newbury Park to rank among the league's four 
strongest teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior middle blocker Kara McKeown is one of the best hitters in the area. 
Norberg and two senior outside hitters, Kristine Arguijo and Julie Wasdell are 
returning starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park received an unexpected boost when Renee Intlekofer, a 5-foot-9 
transfer from Oregon, began practicing with the team last week. Judd said 
Intlekofer has gained eligibility and might play this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Intlekofer was considered one of the top basketball players in Oregon last 
year and has extensive volleyball experience, Judd said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Thousand Oaks, Haar replaces Ron Beick, the successful coach who left the 
area after last season, and has enough talent to join Royal, Newbury Park and 
defending league champion Agoura as a league favorite.  
</P>
<P>
 Senior setter Erin Kelly provides leadership along with Kristen Scott 
(6-foot-3), a transfer from Simi Valley, and sophomore middle blocker Jenn 
Detmer (6-2). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure (Newbury Park) might have a mental edge when we meet face to face," 
Haar said. "But I think we'll be well prepared." 
</P>
<P>
 Haar isn't the only area coach to make an intra-league switch. Former 
Birmingham Coach Bud Dow takes over the program at Chatsworth from Steve Berk, 
who retired as a teacher last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Berk now coaches at St. Bonaventure. 
</P>
<P>
 In 18 years at Birmingham, Dow's teams reached the City Section semifinals 
five times. With the team he inherits, he might get another chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Chatsworth advanced to the 4-A Division semifinals last year, and senior 
middle blocker Jennifer Hodges, sophomore outside hitter Jennifer Joseph and 
senior setter Carla Campo return.  
</P>
<P>
 Four players from the City champion junior varsity team will provide depth. 
</P>
<P>
 Birmingham baseball Coach Rick Weber replaces Dow and inherits a veteran team. 
Two-time All-City middle blocker Maricela Valdez returns for her senior year, 
and the Braves could start six seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Weber coached volleyball from 1981-88 at Bel-Air Prep (now Pacific Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 Teams to Watch: 
</P>
<P>
 Harvard-Westlake -- The Wolverines, a Division I finalist last year, have the 
chance to duplicate that success with senior Amanda Selby. The 6-foot-2 middle 
blocker was an All-Southern Section selection last year and is the best 
returning player in the area.  
</P>
<P>
 Selby must adjust to new setter, Jenny Kriste, and a new coach. Jesse Quiroz, 
boys' volleyball coach, now leads the girls as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs -- The Indians haven't enjoyed much success in recent years, but 
Foothill League coaches point to Burroughs as a potential league champion.  
</P>
<P>
 The team's strength is in the middle with 5-foot-8 junior Christy Russell, a 
two-time all-league player. Senior Suzy Babko is playing her second year of 
volleyball and may be the most improved player on the team. Senior Trisha Arms 
provides help from the outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Royal -- The Highlanders are one of four Marmonte League teams coaches expect 
to be contenders for playoff spots. Coach Bob Ferguson will rely on the 
leadership of his daughter, junior setter Heidi Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 Opposite hitter Michelle Lampkin, junior Kelly Ahern and senior Jessica Cruz 
are offensive threats. "I think this year we're more team-oriented," Bob 
Ferguson said. "We've had good players before but I think this team plays 
together really well." 
</P>
<P>
 Saugus -- Coach Bobbie Estes is rebuilding last year's Division III finalist 
team, but has a good start with four players taller than 5-10. "It will be a 
nice change to have some height. We've been lacking there," Estes said.  
</P>
<P>
 Top players are middle blocker Jennifer Phillips (6 feet), outside hitter 
Amanda Cresap (5-8) and middle blocker Lauren McCartin (5-11). 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill -- The Rebels are deep and experienced enough to unseat Antelope 
Valley as the Golden League champion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Johnson, Kristy Berger and Heather Harris return from a team that 
placed second in the league with an 11-4 record. Outside hitter Kristin 
Sullivan and middle blocker Jaime Hilterbran give Quartz Hill Coach Gary 
Bilderback several options on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys -- The two-time defending City Section 3-A champions are restless. 
Coach Dave Bessler has petitioned the City to move his program to the 4-A 
Division for the playoffs, but a decision is not expected until the playoff 
seeding meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 If the Wolves stay at the 3-A level, setter Connie Chae and middle blockers 
Ruby Tovar and Mira Lew will make Van Nuys a favorite for another title. A 
group of freshmen are ready to provide depth. Van Nuys gets an early test when 
it meets Chatsworth on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Baptist -- The Knights aren't ranked in the preseason Division V poll but 
might soon crack the top 10. Senior outside hitter Darcie Frazier (5-9) was 
second-team All-Southern Section after leading L.A. Baptist to the semifinals 
last year.  
</P>
<P>
 Frazier will be helped by junior setter Tunde Hrotko and an improved defense.

PAVING THE WAY; PIERCE'S WILLIAMS SLEEPS IN CAR, REMAINING SANGUINE ON FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a Pierce College parking lot near the football stadium, not far from where 
roosters at the school's farm noisily announce the dawning of another day, 
Rodney Williams tries to catch some shut-eye. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been at work all night and wants a little rest before going to class. 
After that, it will be football practice and then home for a catnap before 
punching the time clock again. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, the pummeling Williams takes on the field is nothing compared to 
what sleeping in a compact car, even one with a reclining seat, does to his 
6-foot-2, 185-pound body. 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams, a 21-year-old former Palmdale High standout and one-time minor 
league baseball player, can live with a few discomforts.  
</P>
<P>
 This is paradise compared to where he was headed had he not turned his life 
around not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's working out," said Williams, a freshman receiver who redshirted last 
year after suffering a season-ending knee injury. "It's not as bad as it 
sounds." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe not, but how many people would be willing to find out? Williams, though, 
is not your typical guy. When he speaks, the words are laced with confidence, 
with the force of someone who knows what he wants and how to get it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to go into communications," Williams said. "I'm kind of leaning toward 
that field. Probably sports broadcasting." 
</P>
<P>
 That road could be treacherous. It could be disappointing. Those 
possibilities, however, do not discourage him. 
</P>
<P>
 For every sleepless hour he spends as a graveyard-shift watchman in a Los 
Angeles warehouse, sitting in a guard shack instead of lying in bed at his 
Lomita apartment, Williams knows that someday the sacrifice will pay off. 
Actually, it already has.  
</P>
<P>
 The paychecks he brings home will make this school year more manageable than 
the last, when he essentially was broke. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, an unwed father, wants to do right by his four-month-old son, Rodney 
II.  
</P>
<P>
 So the young father must remain focused on football and schoolwork. Only a few 
years ago, Williams had markedly different ambitions. 
</P>
<P>
 "My twin brother (Eric) and I started running with a gang in Santa Monica," 
Williams said. "My mom could see we were going to get in trouble and took us to 
live in Palmdale. We were really mad at her at first, but I don't know where 
I'd be if it hadn't been for my mom. I owe everything to her." 
</P>
<P>
 The twins were born in Oakland but moved to Santa Monica with their mother, 
Gail Barton, when they were about 5. Seven years later, after moving to 
Palmdale, the brothers had straightened up, and Rodney Williams is quick to 
credit his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "My mom went without sometimes to provide for me and my brother," Williams 
said. "She was the backbone of our family." 
</P>
<P>
 She was determined to rescue her sons from an unhealthy environment even 
though they both objected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't really know they were in a gang until one day I went to school and 
they weren't there," Barton said. "That did it. I decided right then and there 
we were moving. My sister was living in Palmdale and I brought them up here 
that same day." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the new surroundings at first did little for Rodney's attitude. The 
brothers played football on the freshman team at Palmdale High, but Eric didn't 
play sports after that and now works in construction.  
</P>
<P>
 Rodney kept at it, but was academically ineligible in the 10th grade. The news 
shook him to the core. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was mad at myself because I knew I had messed up," he said. "I thought it 
over and figured I had to do something. I cracked the books and got my grades 
up. I still got into a few fights but I knew not to cross over the line." 
</P>
<P>
 In his junior season with the Falcons, Williams started at cornerback and was 
the backup quarterback. Hindered by Grades 
</P>
<P>
 He was converted to receiver in 1990, his senior season. But despite his 4.4 
speed over 40 yards, college recruiters stayed away, Williams reasons, because 
his grades had suffered irreparable damage in the 10th grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams found an alternative, however, when the Kansas City Royals selected 
him in the 37th round of the 1991 June amateur baseball draft and tempted him 
with a $40,000 package: $10,000 in cash, the rest for tuition at a four-year 
school.  
</P>
<P>
 Even though he batted .397 and stole 17 bases in his senior season, Williams 
was surprised by the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The scouts kept telling me they were going to draft me, but I didn't take 
them that seriously," Williams said. "I thought, 'If they do that's OK, and if 
they don't, that's OK also.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After two seasons in Class A, Williams was released by the Royals during 
spring training in 1993. Soon after, he called Coach Bill Norton and asked 
about playing football at Pierce. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just sitting on my (butt) every day," Williams said. "One of my buddies 
was down here and I told him I wanted to play." 
</P>
<P>
 But the season ended quickly for Williams. He suffered a twisted knee while 
running a pass pattern in practice after the second game of the season and 
never recovered.  
</P>
<P>
 This season, however, Norton is looking for Williams to help the Brahmas 
challenge for the Western State Conference North Division title and improve on 
a forgettable 5-5 record in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In Pierce's season-opener last Saturday, a 58-24 nonconference loss to 
Palomar, Williams had three receptions for 44 yards and one touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has tremendous ability and quickness," Norton said. "He is not afraid to 
make catches in the middle. And he is a team leader who works very hard. He 
tells guys in practice to yell at him if they see him dogging it." 
</P>
<P>
 Considering his hectic schedule, Williams could be forgiven for going through 
the motions now and then.  
</P>
<P>
 But that's not his style, on the field or in the classroom. He has a 3.15 
grade-point average in core classes, is carrying 18 units this semester and has 
completed 35 units. The next step is a scholarship to a four-year school. 
</P>
<P>
 For Williams, that dream could come true soon, like others that took shape in 
a compact car on a deserted parking lot.

FAIRPLEX; A 19-DAY FEAST FOR DIE-HARDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRED ROBLEDO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of the top thoroughbred jockeys find time to take vacations between the 
end of the Del Mar racing season and the opening of Oak Tree at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the die-hard fan, there is always the brief, but packed, Fairplex Park 
meeting at the Los Angeles County Fair in Pomona, which begins a 19-day run 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 56th season, the first post time has been moved back an hour to 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to attract more people who are working during the day and may 
otherwise only be able to see a couple of races," said George Bradvica, 
Fairplex operations manager. "They will be able to see more of the 
thoroughbreds, and by moving the bulk of our races, the temperatures should be 
cooler, which is better for the horses and the fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Fairplex officials are hoping the move helps the track continue where it left 
off last year, which was the best year in its history. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans wagered an average of $3,756,784 per day at Fairplex, which placed the 
track behind only Del Mar, Santa Anita and Hollywood Park among tracks in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 The track established a single-day record with a parimutuel handle of 
$6,182,263, which broke the previous mark by more than $1.2 million, and an 
all-time single-season record of $71,378,893. 
</P>
<P>
 There is at least one stakes race daily during the meet and three of them are 
scheduled for today. Two are for thoroughbreds, the $50,000 Foothill Stakes, a 
6 1/2-furlong race for 3-year-olds that will be the 10th race, and the $50,000 
Bustles and Bows, for 2-year-old fillies at 6 1/2 furlongs, which will be the 
12th race. 
</P>
<P>
 The other stake will be for quarter horses, the $10,000 Express Stakes at 350 
yards for 3-year-olds and up, which will be run third on the card. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fourth race, the first one for thoroughbreds, jockey David Flores has 
the mount on Shesouravenue in a six-furlong race for maidens. Flores, who 
shared the riding title in 1989 with Corey Black and Martin Pedroza and has won 
the last four here, will be trying to move past the late Freddie Miller to 
become the second all-time leading rider at Fairplex. He is tied with Miller at 
185 victories. Francisco Mena tops the list with 248 winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Corey Nakatani, who recently won his first-riding title at Del Mar, and Kent 
Desormeaux, are riding in the Foothill Stakes. Nakatani will be aboard Freezit 
for owner Lester Holt and trainer Warren Stute. Desormeaux, will ride Ocean 
Indien, owned by R.D. Hubbard and trained by Jean-Pierre Dupuis. The complete 
field in post position order: Rotsaluck, Fernando Valenzuela, 114; Freezit, 
Nakatani, 114; Walk Point, David Flores, 122; Windwood Lad, Walter Guerra, 122; 
Frosty Bid, Victor Mercado, 114; Tajo, John Atherton, 117; Bird County, 
Goncalino Almeida, 114; Subtle Trouble, Paul Atkinson, 117; Ocean Indien, 
Desormeaux, 122; Troyalty, Pat Valenzuela, 122. Card Connection and Windover 
are on the also-eligible list. 
</P>
<P>
 There are only five horses racing in the Bustles and Bows, but one of them, 
Valid Attraction, is owned by Jan, Mace and Samantha Siegel and trained by 
Brian Mayberry, a group that won the race last year with Frigid Coed and also 
in 1989 with Tasteful T.V. Valenzuela will ride Valid Attraction. The field in 
post position order: Charlies Paradise, Flores, 122; Valid Attraction, P. 
Valenzuela, 114; Brite's High, Pedroza, 114; Gamblin A J, F. Valenzuela, 114, 
Shu Biz Annie, Danny Sorenson, 114. . . . There will be two stakes races for 
Appaloosas during the meeting. The first will be the $15,000 Classy Lassie, a 
four-furlong race for 3-year-olds and up Sept. 24. The only stake for Arabian 
horses is the $7,500 Pomona Arabian Invitational Handicap, a seven-furlong race 
Sept. 25.

KEEPING TABS / DANA HADDAD: BROWN BACK ON TOP AT COLORADO ST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leonice Brown broke into the open field -- again. 
</P>
<P>
 A 69-yard touchdown run in the first quarter. A 64-yard gain in the fourth. 
The Colorado State fullback finished with a career-high 191 yards in 17 carries 
in a 41-16 victory over Utah State in Ft. Collins, Colo., last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt really good; it's been a long time," said the 5-foot-11, 192-pound 
senior from San Fernando High. "It was a good day. It would have been an 
incredible day for me, but I hardly played in the second half. When the coaches 
look at the game film, they should see that I could have gone for 260 or 270." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Brown hopes Coach Sonny Lubick and his staff decide to make him No. 
1 again. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, Brown gained 1,056 yards as the Rams' starting tailback in 
former Coach Earle Bruce's wishbone attack. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce was fired after the 1992 season and Lubick switched to an inside 
running attack and moved Brown to fullback. By mid-season, Brown -- fighting an 
injury and struggling with the inside game -- lost his starting job to E.J. 
Watson, The Times' San Diego County offensive player of the year in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown suffered a separated right shoulder in the fifth game against Kansas. He 
returned to action the next week, wearing a brace, but severe pain sent him to 
the bench early in most games. He finished the season with 485 yards, averaging 
only 3.3 yards a carry. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson erupted for 210 yards in the sixth game against Fresno State and 
excelled thereafter. Watson closed out the '93 season with 170 yards at Texas 
El Paso and 159 at Wyoming. He opened the '94 season with 187 yards at Air 
Force. Brown carried three times for nine yards in that game. The No. 1 
fullback job was Watson's. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was feeling down and out. Lubick tried to encourage him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told Leonice not to worry," the coach said. "His chance would come. In our 
offense, we're going to need more than one running back." 
</P>
<P>
 Before Colorado State took the field against Utah State, Watson complained 
about infected feet. One look from the team trainer and Watson was taken to a 
hospital -- in uniform -- with a serious athlete's foot infection. Watson spent 
two days in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown got the start and broke into the open field on his 69-yard run 76 
seconds into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I jumped to the right and made a guy miss on the line of scrimmage," said 
Brown, who was running off tackle. "I headed for the sideline and then I split 
the safeties. They got caught in a blitz and I was gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram coaches slapped Brown on the back and praised him after the game. Now if 
they'll just give him back his job. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "I'm back to normal," Brown said. "I'm just waiting for the opportunity." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Treated like losers: On the West Coast, critics were ridiculing Stanford's 
defense for allowing 41 points in a tie against Northwestern last week. In the 
Midwest, Big Ten Conference officials were apologizing for blowing a call that 
cost Northwestern a victory. 
</P>
<P>
 For Wildcat junior tight end Shane Graham (Thousand Oaks), it was just another 
chapter in 23 years of disappointment at Northwestern. The Wildcats haven't had 
a winning season since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guy fumbled on the two-yard-line," Graham said of Stanford running back 
Mike Mitchell, who lost control of the ball before he crossed the goal line but 
was awarded a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Ten officials said Monday they should have ruled a touchback after a 
Northwestern player recovered the ball in the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if Stanford is as bad as people say," Graham said of a team that 
allowed 465.4 yards per game last season. "They are more of a read-and-react 
defense. But we ran the ball for over 150 yards against Notre Dame (two weeks 
ago). 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing we're trying to rectify is the lack of respect we get. We gotta 
prove week in and week out that we're good." 
</P>
<P>
 That's a tough task at Northwestern. The Wildcats are 0-1-1 this season, own 
the second-longest losing steak in NCAA history (34 games from 1979-82) and 
haven't won more than four games in a season since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham is 6-6, 260 pounds, claims to run a 4.88 40-yard dash and has two 
receptions this year. He was recruited to play tackle by Notre Dame, Michigan 
and Texas, along with every Pacific 10 Conference school. A guaranteed job at 
tight end is what prompted Graham to sign a letter of intent with Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
 The team is desperate for victories, and Big Ten officials aren't helping; 
they unintentionally robbed the Wildcats in 1993, wrongly letting time expire 
before Sam Valenzisi kicked an apparent game-winning field goal against 
Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to fight through (the adversity)," Graham said. "I've been in this 
system two years. It's been fun, but I'm tired of being close. I want to go 
over the top and go to a bowl game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Around the country: Running back Ontiwaun Carter (Kennedy) and wide receiver 
Richard Dice (Alemany) accounted for four of five Arizona touchdowns and 299 of 
the team's 561 yards in a 44-0 rout of New Mexico State last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Dice had five receptions for 150 yards and scoring catches of 57 and 38 yards. 
Carter, who scored on runs of five and seven yards, carried 18 times for 149 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 California wide receiver Iheanyi Uwaezuoke (Harvard-Westlake) had seven 
catches for 88 yards, all in the first half of a 22-20 loss at San Diego State. 
Uwaezuoke's eight-yard touchdown reception in the second quarter gave Cal a 
14-7 lead. Aztec quarterback Tim Gutierrez (Santa Clara) completed 25 of 43 
passes for 314 yards and two touchdowns. Peter Holt (Antelope Valley High) had 
field goals of 22, 21 and 32 yards, the last of which won the game with 3 
minutes 22 seconds left.

THE COLLEGES / FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ; SEASON HAS A SILVER LINING FOR ANTELOPE 
VALLEY'S CARDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every so often, someone sticks a microphone or a note pad in front of a 
longtime coach who just reached another milestone for victories and begs to 
know the secret behind the success. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, the well-rehearsed stock answer goes something like this: 
"Well, I simply outlasted everyone else. That's what happens if you hang around 
long enough." 
</P>
<P>
 What many don't mention, usually out of genuine modesty, is that longevity and 
failure don't mix in coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 They are incompatible, like Roseanne and Tom, the NFL and Al Davis. Put a 
pushover team on the field and they'll run you out of town faster than Lassie 
can down her lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 That has not happened, and never will, to Brent Carder. 
</P>
<P>
 Now in his 25th season as coach of the Antelope Valley College football team, 
Carder has been a fixture because he knows how to coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He knew how in 1974, when Antelope Valley won the first of two consecutive 
state championships, and he knew last year, when the overachieving Marauders 
played in their 13th bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 He has 141 career victories -- fifth among active junior college coaches -- 
going into Saturday's nonconference game against Ventura, and you can't reach 
that kind of milestone on perseverance alone. Carder would have you believe 
otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people we are working with bring a lot of continuity and tradition to the 
program," Carder said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think the most wonderful thing, in terms of coaching, has been the 
relationships and the camaraderie we have here. I don't want to sound corny, 
but in many ways, it's like another family." 
</P>
<P>
 To Carder, 53, family matters are a prevalent theme. He speaks proudly about 
assistant coaches who once played for him and how they returned to help the 
team.  
</P>
<P>
 He points out that he hired every person now associated with the school's 
athletic program, including Marge Hulsizer, his secretary for 18 years.  
</P>
<P>
 And he mentions that his wife, Nan, attends all Marauder football games, and 
their three daughters still do whenever possible. 
</P>
<P>
 It's all part of the makeup of a man who arrived in Lancaster with his family 
in 1946, when all 5,000 people in town probably knew each other and where 
old-time values were vigorously observed and protected.  
</P>
<P>
 By the time he became a highly regarded guard on the Antelope Valley High 
football team, Carder had been schooled in community togetherness. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't ever remember playing a high school or community college game without 
a packed stadium," said Carder, who played for the Marauders in 1958 and '59 
and at UC Santa Barbara.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Kiwanis Club used to put on a game here (the Alfalfa Bowl) between junior 
college teams on Thanksgiving morning. The team that won our conference that 
season would play the winner from another conference. . . .The people would go 
to the game in the morning and then to their family dinner. It was wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 That event disappeared long ago, but not the memories for Carder. They need 
only a nudge to rush back in waves, one seemingly better than the other, but 
all equally gratifying. 
</P>
<P>
 From the two state titles to the seven conference championships, from the nine 
bowl victories to the 15 All-Americans he has coached, they are all dear to 
Carder but perhaps not as rewarding as what his 1982 squad accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had only 31 players and we finished second in the (Foothill) conference," 
Carder said. "I don't think I've had a team that played more to its potential 
than that group of kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Carder's ability to mold athletes into better players and human beings will be 
one legacy the coach will leave when he calls it quits, although the thought 
hasn't crossed his mind. Carder says there are too many things left to achieve, 
too many unfulfilled goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I've accomplished what I set out to do here," he said, "which 
is to have a real solid football and athletic program, not only in terms of 
winning, but in helping our student-athletes develop more academically, to make 
a real positive impact on their lives that will carry over." 
</P>
<P>
 That, in a nutshell, is the secret to one coach's success. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Radio daze: Want to catch an earful of Cal State Northridge football on the 
radio? Better live near campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic department officials initially struck a broadcast deal with KMGX-FM 
of Mission Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the station changed ownership on Sept. 9, the day before the Matadors 
opened against Boise State. When the station changed hands, the deal fell 
through, a Northridge spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge officials scrambled to find another station.  
</P>
<P>
 One possible candidate was found, but the station went with a slightly bigger 
draw. . . and decided to broadcast Notre Dame football instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Games now will be transmitted on the school station, KCSN 88.5 FM. The campus 
station can be picked up throughout much of the San Fernando Valley, but 
reception is often spotty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deluge: The four members of the American West Conference -- Northridge, Cal 
State Sacramento, Southern Utah and Cal Poly San Luis Obispo -- are a combined 
1-4 after last weekend's games. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday, the not-so-fearsome foursome was outscored, 160-77. It could have 
been worse, Sacramento defeated San Francisco State, 30-0. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Body count: The crowd of 19,489 that watched host Boise State defeat 
Northridge, 40-19, last weekend was the third-largest throng ever to see a 
Matador game. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 opener against host San Diego State drew 40,872 at Jack Murphy 
Stadium. The largest home crowd in school history is 7,127, set at a game 
against Cal Poly San Luis Obispo in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New additions: Northridge last week added two players to its football roster.  
</P>
<P>
 Derek Brown, a sophomore transfer, was the backup quarterback last season at 
Orange Coast College and is expected to redshirt this season. Brown (6-2, 185) 
was recruited by Northridge as a senior out of Mayfair High in Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Rondell Cooper, a true freshman from Van Nuys High, also will 
redshirt. Cooper (5-10, 175) played last summer in the Daily News all-star 
game.

LARSEN COMES OF AGE FOR IRVINE FOOTBALL; HIGH SCHOOLS: QUARTERBACK MUST MASTER 
THE WAITING GAME BEFORE GETTING A CHANCE TO DIRECT THE OFFENSE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Being a quarterback at Irvine High is an all and nothing proposition. You're 
nothing on the depth chart until you're a senior, but it usually takes all that 
time to learn Coach Terry Henigan's offensive scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to argue with Henigan's success ratio. Irvine has won three 
consecutive Southern Section championships -- two at the Division IV level and 
one at Division II -- with three quarterbacks. All were seniors who put in the 
time to get their turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the ball and Irvine's 1994 fate rests in the hands of 17-year-old Scott 
Larsen, who, like predecessors Mike Phelps, Aron Garcia and Jason Minici, took 
his first game snaps in his final year of high school. His initiation was a 
good one -- 11 of 19 for 160 yards and one touchdown in a 28-6 stroll past 
University last Friday. His only interception came on the final play of the 
first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd been a backup the past two years and got to see what it takes to be a 
starting quarterback," said Larsen, as Irvine was preparing to meet Mission 
Viejo on Friday. "I learned it takes a long time to learn the offense. Now I 
understand what needs to be done and I feel I'm ready." 
</P>
<P>
 More ready, perhaps, than his teammates or Henigan and staff first believed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year at this time the players and the coaches would have questioned 
whether Scott would have made it as a quarterback," Henigan said. "There's no 
question now. There might be better quarterbacks around, but if they had moved 
to Irvine this summer they wouldn't have beaten out Scott Larsen. He just knows 
the system." 
</P>
<P>
 Ah yes, the system. A one-back, four-receiver contrivance designed to spread 
out defenses like unfolded maps while giving the opposition few chances to shut 
down the Vaqueros. If they have a talented runner, like a Scott Seal or a Tony 
Mathis, he can see the ball 40 or more times a game. If the receivers are swift 
and the line can block effectively, it becomes a maddening game of who to try 
and neutralize. 
</P>
<P>
 The key, however, is the quarterback. He must know every play in Henigan's 
book, and know the opposition's defense enough that he can change the called 
play at the line of scrimmage if need be. Henigan puts so much faith and 
demands on his quarterback, only the starter runs the team in practice or the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Scott goes down hurt, we'll be horrible," Henigan said. "If Phelps had 
gone down last year, Scott would not have been able to step in." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, they have thrived. Phelps, now at Oregon, passed for 1,531 yards and 
15 touchdowns in the regular season. Garcia (who was a wide receiver a year 
before) had 1,300 yards and 12 touchdowns as a senior. Minici threw for 1,584 
yards and 12 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot has to do with Henigan and the coaching," said Phelps, a redshirt 
freshman. "We were definitely ready when we got our turn. It was hard to wait, 
but everybody has to pay their dues. And I learned as much from Aron and Jason 
as I did the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Scott will do well; he's a good guy, a very hard worker. Another guy 
along the line of quarterbacks at Irvine. He has a lot to live up to, but if 
any guy can, Scott can. He gets the job done. Execution is the main thing in 
our offense, and he can do that." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked how he's bearing up considering his life is pretty much football, 
studies and sleep, Larsen smiles slightly. "I knew from the get-go when I 
wanted to be a quarterback that it would take an extra amount of dedication and 
time. So it didn't bother me; I knew the more time I put into it, the more I'd 
get out of it." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether he can turn that into college success is a legitimate question. Most 
recruiters are sizing up quarterbacks in their junior seasons unless, like 
Phelps (6-5, 210), they are a physical specimen who would draw attention no 
matter when they played. Larsen could have a fabulous year, and then call it a 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is he a prospect?" said Dick Lascola, owner of the Fallbrook-based Scouting 
Evaluation Assn. "Depends on the season he has. But you can say that about all 
kids. If he's good, somebody will find out or hear about him. It would be nice 
if a quarterback has two years, but Steve Beuerlein's senior year (he attended 
Servite and is now with the Arizona Cardinals) was his proving time like it has 
been been for a few of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Of average athletic size (6 feet and 180 pounds), Larsen is not the type to 
antagonize opponents, guarantee victories or demand a shrine be built at his 
locker. Ask him about himself and he steers any credit to his offensive 
linemen, receivers and runners. He says he's grateful his teammates believe in 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 But cloaked by his reticent nature is an analytical mind and a dead calm 
pulse. Irvine's style would appear to be vulnerable to the all-out blitz, yet 
when University tried it in the third quarter, Larsen -- who sensed the 
impending disaster and changed the play -- stepped out the way and nearly 
completed an eight-yard pass. And while Larsen may not be outwardly cocky, he 
knows he has the team's confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Does he feel pressured to continue Irvine's championship roll? "Oh, I imagine 
he does," Henigan said. "He's following three very good quarterbacks. But we 
don't talk about it with him and we wouldn't even think of comparing him with 
others. Scott's his own quarterback and we're happy to have him." 
</P>
<P>
 Larsen, however, remains unmoved by the "four-peat" chatter at Irvine. When 
you're a Vaquero quarterback, good things usually come to those who wait. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to look at one game at a time," Larsen said. "Just prepare for that 
team and have fun."

THOUSAND OAKS BRACING FOR HART; FOOTBALL: RICHARDS SAYS HIS TEAM HAS STRENGTH 
TO RUN THE BALL AGAINST FOOTHILL LEAGUE POWER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Coach Bob Richards subscribes to the theory that a football team 
can improve by playing tough opponents. So Richards once again scheduled his 
Southern Section Division III Lancers against Division II Foothill League 
members Hart and Saugus. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Thousand Oaks lost three games to Foothill League teams by an 
average of nine points. Last week, Saugus tore up Thousand Oaks, 32-14, in a 
season opener. The Lancers managed 162 yards, only 28 passing. Tonight at 7:30 
at Canyon High, the Lancers must contend with Hart, a 41-18 winner over San 
Fernando last week and the No. 3 team in The Times' area rankings. The Lancers 
must brace for Hart's potent run-and-shoot offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know we have good football players on our line, and I think we have the 
strength to run the ball," Richards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks would love to control the clock with long scoring drives and 
keep Hart's offense off the field. But Saugus limited standout running back 
Brandon Jackson to 31 yards in 10 carries last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart, however, already has proved it can run as effectively as it can pass. 
Five of its six touchdowns and 190 of its 304 yards against San Fernando came 
on the ground. Junior running back Ted Iacenda rushed for 120 yards and scored 
five touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 "We might pass or we might run," Hart Coach Mike Herrington said. "It just 
depends on what the defense keys on."

DIGEST: CLAY OK FOR NORTH HOLLYWOOD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sophomore Dante Clay was granted unrestricted eligibility to play football at 
North Hollywood High this season by vote of the City Section rules committee 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clay was thrust into the spotlight in the spring when Taft Coach Troy Starr 
was caught actively recruiting the promising running back, who played on 
Crespi's freshmen team last season. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-10, 180-pound Clay, who visited Taft and was given a campus tour by 
Starr, will play Friday in North Hollywood's game against Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has great speed and he's a natural runner . . . the type of runner we 
haven't had at North Hollywood in a long time," Huskie Coach Gary Gray said. 
"He'll have an immediate impact on our program."  
</P>
<P>
 Clay, 15, who returned to Walter Reed Junior High after the football season 
last year, had to apply for eligibility because he transferred schools without 
changing residence. Walter Reed is a feeder school for North Hollywood. PAIGE

MATERIAL SUCCESS; A GARMENT IS ONLY AS GOOD AS THE QUALITY OF ITS FABRIC. FOR 
THE PROPER TOUCH OF CLASS, WEAVE AND TEXTURE ARE THE GIVEAWAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To unravel the secret of a well-made garment, look at its fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Better yet, feel the fabric. Is it soft or scratchy? Do your fingers run 
smoothly over its surface? If it feels good, chances are that it's a 
high-quality material and that the garment itself has been constructed with 
attention to detail. 
</P>
<P>
 A fine fabric is what separates a good-looking garment from one that looks, 
well, cheap. It can cause a suit to drape instead of rumple, or pants to flow 
smoothly over the legs instead of clinging to the calves. 
</P>
<P>
 This season there's more attention to fabrics than ever because styles are 
rather austere. Bereft of obvious ornamentation and distracting prints, the 
fabric of a garment suddenly comes into focus. Luxury fibers such as silk, 
linen, cashmere and wool, often blended in innovative combinations, become 
important. Weaves and textures are more pronounced. 
</P>
<P>
 Ermenegildo Zegna, a new menswear store in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa, 
often experiments with blends of fibers to create one-of-a-kind fabrics for its 
collection of suits, sport coats, jackets and other men's clothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Zegna began in Italy as a textile company in 1910 and still makes its own 
fabric at a mill high in the mountains of Trivero. The company's fall line 
includes suits of finely spun wool, such as a sport coat of taupe-colored wool 
crepe with a subtle waffle texture ($850); a sport coat of cashmere and linen 
blend in whiskey green or blue ($1,150), and a collection of pure cashmere 
sweaters, including a baby-soft crew neck of multicolored yarn ($695). 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers are much more conscious of fabrics," says Richard Cohen, president 
of the Ermenegildo Zegna Corp. in New York City. "If you don't have good 
quality fiber and fabric, a suit isn't going to perform. A so-so garment will 
have tell-tale signs. In a humid climate the seams will bubble or the fabric 
will pill." 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen has chosen a finely woven taupe suit to take him through a long day that 
includes appointments in Orange County, Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 "My suit will look the same tonight as it does this morning," he says. The 
reason is the fabric. The wool is spun and woven so tight it doesn't wrinkle. 
</P>
<P>
 To weigh the quality of the fabric used in a sport coat, he suggests first 
shutting your eyes and feeling the sleeves. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's smooth and not oily, nine times out of 10 it will be of good 
quality," he says. "Then put it on. If it's soft on you and not stiff, it's a 
fine fabric." 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of the fabric begins with the fibers from which it is woven. 
Cashmere is considered a luxury fiber because of its softness and relative 
scarcity. Silk is renowned for the way it feels and the way it takes color, 
while wool is prized for its versatility, spinning qualities and durability. 
</P>
<P>
 A label announcing the presence of these fibers is not, however, a guarantee 
of good quality. A sweater that's 100% cashmere may be made from poor quality 
cashmere, Cohen says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cashmere may have been picked up from the mill floor," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some unscrupulous manufacturers even mix cashmere with other fibers without 
disclosing so on the label. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why you have cashmere at all different price points," says Lisa 
Cervantes, senior vice president of TSE Cashmere. 
</P>
<P>
 TSE (pronounced SAY) gets its cashmere from the undercoats of Kashmir goats it 
raises in China. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes it expensive and unique is that it's difficult to get a lot of 
fiber," Cervantes says. "After the fiber is combed off the goat, it has to be 
sorted by length, diameter and softness. When you sort it, you end up with 
incredible, cloud-like fluff." 
</P>
<P>
 Some manufacturers don't sort the fiber in order to lower their costs. They 
can still call it "pure cashmere," but you can feel the difference, Cervantes 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should feel very silky. A cashmere sweater should not have a lot of hairs 
sticking out like Angora. That's a sign of poor quality." 
</P>
<P>
 The men's and women's separates at TSE Cashmere in South Coast Plaza are made 
solely from natural fibers, from a lightweight cashmere and silk blend to a 
thick, coat-weight material of 100% cashmere. Sea island cotton and extra-fine 
wool twisted so tight it feels like cotton are also used in the collections. 
For fall, TSE created crop tops in a nubby cashmere silk chenille ($365), a 
silk poor-boy cardigan ($365) and a pure cashmere car coat ($1,150). 
</P>
<P>
 "With any natural fabric, you want a soft, silky hand," Cervantes says. "It's 
really the way the fabric feels to the touch." 
</P>
<P>
 How the fiber is spun and woven greatly influences its "hand." Cotton can feel 
like cashmere and wool like silk if tightly spun and woven. 
</P>
<P>
 Zegna uses a finely spun cotton to make a sport coat that has plenty of body 
but the feel of cashmere (available in an olive and taupe glen plaid for $700). 
Its super 100 wool is spun 100 kilometers for every gram of fiber, producing a 
fabric with such a tight weave that it has a soft touch but doesn't wrinkle, 
Cohen says. One suit comes in navy super 100 wool with a hand-stitched 
double-breasted collar ($1,450). 
</P>
<P>
 A fabric need not be of natural fibers to be of high quality. Many synthetic 
yarns and fibers can create great-looking garments. 
</P>
<P>
 Synthetics have improved greatly since the days of stiff and suffocating 
polyester. Some breathe like cotton, drape like a fine wool crepe and hold 
their color better than silk. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondi in Fashion Island Newport Beach and MainPlace/Santa Ana uses both 
synthetic and natural fibers in its collections. There's a scarf print blouse 
made of viscose ($190), a soft blazer ($290) and skirt ($170) in coffee-colored 
microfiber, and cranberry-colored pants in textured velvet made of a cotton and 
rayon blend ($170). 
</P>
<P>
 The synthetics are used to enhance the performance of the fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 Viscose is often used for blouses because "it dyes much better than silk, and 
it's more durable," says Cathie Phillips, manager of Mondi in MainPlace. Velvet 
pants have rayon added to the cotton so they're not as stiff as 100% cotton. 
Some of Mondi's knits have acrylic added to the wool because they hold up 
better in the wash, and they're cooler than pure wool. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether synthetic or natural, the method for judging a fabric is the same: 
Reach out and touch it. Well-made synthetics should have the same soft, smooth 
hand as natural fabrics. The proof of the quality is at one's fingertips.

HELP FROM A PLACE WHERE HOPE IS NOT ABANDONED; SERVICES: OFFICIALS AT ST. 
FRANCIS MEDICAL CENTER WANT THEIR BABY ANTHONY HOTLINE TO REACH THE WOMAN 
DESPERATE ENOUGH TO ABANDON HER CHILD IN A DUMPSTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It is a red telephone that has sat since December on a desk in a room of its 
own at St. Francis Medical Center. Attached to it is a medal of St. Anthony, 
the patron saint of lost children. It has rung more than 100 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost always, the caller is someone who wants to adopt a baby. And that is 
good. But hospital officials still await the first real test of the Baby 
Anthony Hotline when the caller will be a woman who has just delivered an 
unwanted baby and is considering abandoning it. 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to reach that woman, the Lynwood hospital is expanding its 
advertising and honing its message. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, three billboards were erected in the South Bay area showing a 
sketch of outstretched arms dropping a baby into a garbage can marked with a 
big red X. The only words are "Call for help," printed above the hot-line 
number, (800) 606-2229. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials hope the new posters will get their message across quicker 
and more clearly than the last ones, which showed two nuns tenderly holding 
babies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe this is a more universal symbol of what we are trying to address, 
and that it will reach out to more groups of people," says Linda Woo, public 
relations manager at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do hear about other abandoned babies, maybe not in our city, but in 
outlying areas, so when we hear that, we want to make sure our message is being 
heard." 
</P>
<P>
 They wish the mother of a baby found dead Saturday in a Hollywood trash bin 
would have seen one of their signs. Before giving birth, the woman reportedly 
asked friends if any of them wanted the child. 
</P>
<P>
 They wish the telephone would have been in place on Sept. 12, 1992, to take a 
call from a woman who gave birth to a boy found in a South Gate trash 
container. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby was found by a couple of teen-agers and rushed to St. Francis. The 
child, covered with ants and ant bites, survived and became known around the 
hospital as Baby Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident prompted the hospital, in conjunction with local service 
organizations and an ambulance service, to establish its abandoned baby 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you have a baby and don't know what to do with it, and you're in a panic 
situation, what are you going to do? We want to reach out to that state of 
mind," says Anne Bruner, a medical social worker at the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Francis will send an ambulance to pick up the baby and, if wanted, will 
provide confidential counseling and medical care for the mother as well. 
</P>
<P>
 If the mother chooses not to keep the baby, adoption proceedings are 
initiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruner has counseled eight callers with varying problems through the hot line; 
two opted for adoption services. 
</P>
<P>
 "Adoption isn't always a comfortable thing in this culture," Bruner says. "A 
mother releasing her baby is still looked down upon, and we would like them to 
get more comfortable with (adoption)." 
</P>
<P>
 The hot line doesn't just counsel women considering abandoning their babies. 
It also is a referral service to other programs -- such as adoption and 
prenatal care. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital is working with schools, fast-food restaurants, video stores -- 
places where the message is likely to reach young people by distributing 
flyers, Woo says. The hospital also hopes to have posters placed on buses and 
garbage bins. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty to 30 babies are found abandoned each year in Los Angeles County, says 
Schuyler Sprowles, information director for the Department of Children 
Services, which also sponsors a hot line ((800) 540-4000). 
</P>
<P>
 Each year, four or five abandoned baby deaths are investigated by the 
Coroner's Office, says Dean Gilmour, captain of the Investigation Division. 
</P>
<P>
 At St. Francis, the numbers are not great. Prior to Baby Anthony, an average 
of one abandoned baby a year was brought in. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to speak to the fact that one baby abandoned is too many, that one 
woman living with the heartache of not knowing what happened to her baby, 
whether it was found, is too many," says Sister Elizabeth Joseph Keaveney, 
president and chief executive officer of the hospital. "That's a wound that 
will not heal." 
</P>
<P>
 Although hospital officials hope the program successfully reaches out to women 
considering abandoning their babies, there have been no cases at St. Francis 
since Baby Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
 And that, too, is good.

ALL ABOUT YVES; RUMORS AND SCANDALS ASIDE, YVES SAINT LAURENT'S PLACE IN 
FASHION HISTORY IS ASSURED. HIS INFLUENCE, LONG DORMANT, IS BEING SEEN 
EVERYWHERE THIS FALL. SO WHAT'S WITH THE PROMOTIONAL APPEARENCE IN NEW YORK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Yves Saint Laurent was the Buddy Holly of fashion: super thin with dark, 
square glasses; vigorous and with it. 
</P>
<P>
 But somehow, overnight, the fashion icon retreated into old age. And he's only 
58. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday night, at the launch of his newest scent, Champagne, Saint Laurent -- 
unsteady and bloated -- struggled to focus. Although he still has the shock of 
brown hair and wrap-around smile, behind the dark, square glasses he seemed in 
his own world. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it is hard for a man who lives in isolation to react when there are 
cameras flashing. The next day at an intimate lunch at Nan Kempner's Park 
Avenue apartment, he apparently was in better shape. Saint Laurent, Kempner 
said, is "totally free" from drugs and alcohol, problems he has acknowledged 
over the years. "He was adorable and all excited about being in New York," 
Kempner said. Nonetheless, years of overindulgence have "left their mark." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about Saint Laurent's health, his partner and protector, Pierre Berge -- 
the bull to Saint Laurent's doe -- snapped: 
</P>
<P>
 "He works very hard and very well. The rest, we don't care."  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the bad reviews, the rumors, the scandals, the lawsuits are remnants 
compared to the racks of his original creations that dominated fashion in the 
'60s and '70s. Although his work has been dismissed in the last few years, as 
recently as this fall echoes of his elegant looks showed up in the collections 
of young designers. He'll always be material for fashion history. 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't explain why he had to appear at the Statue of Liberty this 
week. A year ago Saint Laurent sold his name and empire to Elf Sanofi, a French 
government-owned company. And the perfume launch was an example of what happens 
when a designer, even one as reclusive as Saint Laurent, sells his body: He 
must produce it. Particularly to flog perfume, which raises on average 85% of 
most designers' profits. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, in one of the most beautiful settings in this metropolis -- Liberty 
Island -- with the Manhattan skyline as a backdrop, Saint Laurent came out to 
pose with a giant bottle of perfume. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 1,200 guests were members of fashion's old guard. All were most kind 
about Saint Laurent. "I adore him," Bill Blass said. "Yves is just the 
greatest," said Oscar de la Renta. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite 10,000 votive candles, 12 minutes of fireworks and the torch held by 
the lady herself, there wasn't enough light. So old friends stumbled into each 
other as they refilled their flute glasses with champagne. In the end, it was a 
lovely evening -- but a most sober one. After the last fireworks at 9:45, 
people raced to the ferries to be the first to get their cars from valet 
parking. This was nothing like the wild revelry of 16 years ago, when Saint 
Laurent launched Opium aboard a Chinese junk parked under the Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Opium party, perhaps like the decadent Studio 54 era during which it was 
held, was by all accounts much naughtier: More people were snorting cocaine in 
the bathroom than ingesting 13,000 oysters, clams and mussels on the disco 
deck. People were actually having sex on a lower deck. And the cream of society 
and fashion, led by Diana Vreeland and Truman Capote, showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were heady, glamorous times in New York, and Yves Saint Laurent was the 
premier couturier . 
</P>
<P>
 He had single-handedly saved haute couture in the politically tumultuous '60s 
by keeping rich clients in sync with students rioting in the streets. Rather 
than run away from the democratization of fashion, as Chanel and Balenciaga 
had, Saint Laurent suggested it was chic to wear bomber jackets over ball 
gowns; he adapted pea jackets and smocks for ladies who lunch; he introduced 
the rich peasant look and dyed fur apple green. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the '70s, the Saint Laurent look was ubiquitous, with women 
showing up for all occasions in square-shouldered blazers, trousers and vinyl 
raincoats. 
</P>
<P>
 And for a generation of designers growing up in a fashion climate influenced 
by ready-to-wear, Saint Laurent demonstrated the enduring value of haute 
couture -- of a beauty and rigor that can only come through custom-making 
clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 Saint Laurent's glory years lasted an unusually long time -- almost 20 years. 
But like a painter who fills several museum galleries with extraordinary works 
and then as many with barely an interesting canvas, Saint Laurent's work in the 
1980s was at best routine. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's fashion heroes are Giorgio Armani and Jil Sander, both of whom have 
blended America's love of sportswear with European tailoring for women with 
careers.  
</P>
<P>
 While Saint Laurent's initials blanket sunglasses and men's shirts in China 
and his name recognition in Europe remains high, his image on American shores 
has foundered as home-grown designers such as Calvin Klein and Donna Karan have 
come to the fore. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem may be that in fashion, image is everything and Saint 
Laurent's has become, well, static. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich women who buy $30,000 haute c outure suits or even $6,000 dresses like to 
identify with their designers. And the life of Saint Laurent has been more 
closely identified with trauma than success. 
</P>
<P>
 He has admitted to cocaine abuse and debilitating alcoholism; he has openly 
discussed the trials of growing up homosexual in Algeria during the '30s and 
'40s; he once considered throwing himself into the Seine with a prized bronze 
sculpture tied around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-'80s he was finding it increasingly difficult to produce four 
collections a year. His business was also mired in debt. In January, 1993, he 
and Berge sold YSL to Elf Sanofi for $650 million and had to fend off charges 
of insider trading after the deal. Even the Champagne launch came amid 
controversy. The French Champagne industry won a lawsuit that bars the perfume 
being sold under that name in France. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of it all, Yves Saint Laurent is still spoken of by people with a 
memory beyond that last collection with a reverence, if not a sadness, reserved 
for a god. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the heights of his glory, Saint Laurent articulated a vision that many 
women of all ages aspired to," Holly Brubach wrote in the New Yorker in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now that his collections have failed to move forward, his house attracts 
mostly middle-aged women whose prime coincided with his own, who continue to 
adhere to the style they dressed in during the years when they felt at their 
most attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 15, 1957, he was 21, so alive, so wildly handsome, so remarkably shy 
but self-assured. It was on this day that Yves Saint Laurent, an obscure 
assistant born in Algiers to a French upper-crust family, was presented to the 
fashion press. He was to be the successor to Christian Dior, who had died a 
month earlier. He was to be master of the House of Dior and its 1,400 
employees. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aren't you frightened?" he was asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not at all," he replied. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1958, he unveiled his first collection, starring the "trapeze" dress, a 
sexy extension of Dior's sack dress except that it hung free from the shoulders 
and dipped at the bosom. It was shown on his favorite model, Victoire, a pert 
and curvy Dior mannequin, and the Avenue Montaigne, Paris' fashion boulevard, 
received it with bravos. 
</P>
<P>
 But in just a few years, the House of Dior expelled him. He had the gall to 
put women in "beatnikish clothes," according to one report: an alligator 
raincoat, turtleneck sweaters, a knitted cap. It was too much, too young, too 
mod for the couture customer, usually a duchess in the middle years of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumor was, the House of Dior, which had helped Saint Laurent get a deferment 
from the French army, suddenly had him drafted. So he went from the perfumed 
fashion houses to the barracks, and there he had his first nervous collapse. 
Victoire and Pierre Berge, an arrogant young art dealer who had fallen in love 
with Saint Laurent at a party, rescued him and together in 1961 they opened a 
new couture house on the unfashionable Rue Spontini. 
</P>
<P>
 Again Saint Laurent was an overnight success. 
</P>
<P>
 He put women in safari jackets and men's suits. But he managed to feminize all 
these masculine styles. He was also the first to show the micro-mini on leggy 
models.  
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the '70s, everyone was tired of looking as if they'd spent all 
day planning a revolution, and to everyone's relief, Saint Laurent brought back 
evening wear -- gorgeous taffeta ball gowns, sable-trimmed Cossack coats and, 
of course, "Le Smoking," an evening suit that looked like a man's tuxedo. 
</P>
<P>
 His color combinations also became legendary. He had the audacity to pair 
fuchsia and neon yellow. And no one used red the way Saint Laurent did to 
create an ultra-arch sexuality. His models and his muses, such as Paloma 
Picasso, Loulou de la Falaise and Betty Catroux -- women with strong features 
and great style -- always wore dark red lipstick and deep carmine-red nails. 
</P>
<P>
 This is one of the many areas where Saint Laurent took a standard fashion 
template and did it again and again, sort of the way a composer uses a 
particular concerto. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used colors the way a sensitive collagist might -- full blown, in unusual 
combinations," said Richard Martin, curator of the Metropolitan Museum's 
Costume Institute, which staged a retrospective of Saint Laurent's work in 
1983. 
</P>
<P>
 With the first infusion of financial success, the shy and fragile 6-foot-2 
designer and his short, confident partner bought a townhouse together on the 
Rue de Babylone and became one of the most celebrated homosexual couples in 
Paris. Together they also bought a sumptuous chateau in Normandy and another 
house in Marrakech, Morocco, where they entertained jet-set friends. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Vanity Fair writer Bob Colacello, their crowd was made up of 
"rich hippies obsessed by style. Everything had to be absolutely divine -- 
clothes, jewelry, furniture, paintings, food, presentation of food. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Colacello, then-editor of Andy Warhol's Interview magazine, recalled going 
with Warhol to Saint Laurent's salon in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pierre was very much the papa and the rest were his children. I guess Yves 
was more than a child -- he was the sun around which everything revolved. It 
was a tight-knit, incestuous, extremely fast-living crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 And it was often impenetrable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can remember times when they would even leave me and Andy out, and start 
speaking French knowing full well we couldn't understand them," Colacello said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Valentino, De la Renta and Blass, Saint Laurent's clique pioneered 
the idea of fashion designers as social arbiters. Their extravagant homes, 
cars, and trips to China and India were promoted in glossy magazines and 
eventually, they took the places of old aristocratic families as the kings and 
queens of lifestyle. 
</P>
<P>
 There seem to be no limit to how much Saint Laurent and Berge could spend. But 
even then, at the height of his success, Saint Laurent's pattern of creativity, 
anxiety and despair undermined him. 
</P>
<P>
 In her French biography of Saint Laurent, Laurence Banim, a 32-year-old 
fashion writer for the newspaper Le Monde, described this "infernal cycle" and 
the many mental collapses that predictably followed each collection. 
</P>
<P>
 In time, the politically connected Berge began hawking their company around 
the financial world and the state-owned Elf Sanofi eventually bought all of 
Berge's and Saint Laurent's shares. Each walked away with $72 million. Both 
also received long-term contracts to manage the couture house into the next 
century. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've both been anxious for some time to guarantee the longevity of the 
house," Berge told Women's Wear Daily. "It's more than a business for Yves. 
It's like a child. It's his art." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is not surprising that such a cultivated man and sensitive soul as Saint 
Laurent drew inspiration from the works of Picasso and Mondrian. Saint Laurent 
is among a group of designers, such as Romeo Gigli and Jil Sander, who see 
themselves as artists. This might seem pretentious, but it also explains how 
they justify their pricey clothes in a world in which most people couldn't 
imagine spending their annual salary on a sweater or a dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet no one more than Saint Laurent himself recognizes that the era of the 
great couturier is ending. He has often likened himself to his beloved Marcel 
Proust as someone who is watching the old order die. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, he confessed that he once considered abandoning couture for 
"mass manufacturing." 
</P>
<P>
 "But it was too late," he said in an interview. "I had too much responsibility 
to the people who had helped me establish my maison. " 
</P>
<P>
 When he talks about those "people," he often includes his clients. Although he 
could often be caught in his heyday mimicking them on the second floor of his 
studio, there is no doubt that Saint Laurent deeply admires women. 
</P>
<P>
 Gretchen Wayne, 58-year-old L.A. socialite and daughter-in-law of the late 
John Wayne, is one of the women who has kept the House of Saint Laurent afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, as she was running out to a Pete Wilson fund-raiser, wearing a 
Saint Laurent tweed jacket with a fringe around the bottom, she paused to 
explain her loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jackets are the finest fits, the shoulders feel like nobody else's, the 
evening wear is so elegant," she gushed. A Size 6, she has been buying his 
clothes since 1970, when the Rive Gauche boutique opened in Beverly Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 "I add pieces to my wardrobe and mix them with things I bought 20 years ago. 
This isn't to say I haven't let out the waists or raised and dropped the hems. 
I just think his clothes are beautiful. He endures." 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Leon Talley, Vogue's creative director, recalls watching Saint Laurent 
take three yards of white hat veil and a rose satin ribbon and turn them into a 
halter top on a model. 
</P>
<P>
 "To see the hands tie the ribbon and caress the breast with the tulle was 
fantastic, " Talley said. "It was a poetic moment of a great person who is in 
his own world of fantasy and eroticism. Only he could do it that way. He 
managed to make out of this tulle and ribbon something quite ethereal, quite 
sexy and quite modern." 
</P>
<P>
 And he did it as quickly and naturally as someone else might take a sip of 
water. It's moments like these, and the summary of those moments, not the 
tortured underpinnings, that will be remembered.

HE SAID / SHE SAID: NO SECOND CHANCE AT FIRST IMPRESSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK MOTT and ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 W e may be slouching toward the middle years, but our circadian rhythms are 
still on the mark. Here it is early September, and we keep getting the nagging 
feeling we ought to be going back to school.  
</P>
<P>
 And along with that feeling comes the slightly uncomfortable notion that we 
have to get ready to make a good first impression. Because -- remember? -- the 
first impression you were going to make on schoolmates you may not have seen 
for three months weighed fairly heavily on your mind.  
</P>
<P>
 Have we learned anything since then? Do we still get a dry mouth when we know 
we're about the be evaluated for the first time?  
</P>
<P>
  
</P>
<P>
 HE: I got my first lesson in first impressions during my first week of high 
school. I played football that year, and the team was required to work out for 
a good part of the summer. Neck exercises were very big. We were also required, 
as a show of idiot solidarity, to shave our heads. With newly muscular necks 
and no hair, we all looked like .45 slugs from the shoulders up. 
</P>
<P>
 My best friend started calling me Fuzzy, or Bullethead. Girls who used to be 
friendly looked at me as if I'd turned into a serial killer. The ragging went 
on for many long days. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd made a memorable first impression, all right, but I had to spend the next 
year or two undoing it. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: When I was in school, all I thought about were first impressions, second 
impressions, third, fourth and fifth impressions. I was terribly worried about 
how others saw me. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that I am a grown-up, full of confidence (most of the time), I'm the 
one with the checklist. No sooner do I say, "Nice to meet you," than I notice a 
person's teeth (clean, healthy?), fingernails (clean, manicured?), figure 
(overweight? svelte?), hair (stylish? unkempt?). 
</P>
<P>
 Notice I didn't say clothes or jewelry. I couldn't care less. Though I admire 
good taste in both. But people who take good care of themselves physically are 
usually worth knowing. Those who don't, aren't. After all, if he or she doesn't 
care about themselves, how could they care about me? 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Here's a neat trick. Next time you're introduced to someone for the first 
time, try to make sure you're close enough to them to get a close look at their 
eyes -- a really close look. The pupils involuntarily react to what they see -- 
and to what the brain tells them about what they see -- and they accordingly 
expand or contract like the lens of a camera. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say you open the door and there stands Ed McMahon with a big check. Your 
pupils automatically dilate because your brain wants to let the eyes take in 
every bit of that lovely sight (the check, I mean). On the other hand, if you 
open the door and clap eyes on a guy holding a subpoena, the pupils shrink to 
pin dots. 
</P>
<P>
 This little anatomy lesson can save you loads of time and strained 
conversation. Of course the person across from you with the saucer-like orbs 
could hate your guts and have just gotten into the pot stash. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Have you thought about a career in optometry? 
</P>
<P>
 Bet you're dying to know what makes my pupils dilate when a guy comes into 
view. Surprise! After the above-stated grooming musts, a happy expression. 
Nothing turns me off faster than a guy who looks like he's ready to wield a 
whip. But, have him flash a sincere megawatt smile my way, and I'm mush. 
</P>
<P>
 After that, I notice a man's grammar (if he says "don't" instead of "doesn't" 
I'm outta there) and his table manners (does he slather butter over the top of 
a whole roll?). 
</P>
<P>
 Then, finally, his humor. You know what they say about men who make women 
laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 HE: Yeah, I know: "Oh, you are sooooooooooooo funny! Let's just be good 
friends." 
</P>
<P>
 But back to business. Maybe I just have a strong instinct for 
self-preservation, but I tend to notice a kind of overall presence when I look 
at a woman. It's a kind of combination of posture, carriage, ease, openness. 
Mostly it's a lack of artifice, either in movement or in speech or in 
expression. And, just like you, I can be chased from a room by a flinty, 
knife-edged, casehardened look that says that this woman, more than anything 
else, wants to be feared. Believe me, I'll oblige her. 
</P>
<P>
 And a nice smile isn't good enough. Lots of people can show you their 
dentist's best work and still look at you with eyes like dry ice. The entire 
face has to be involved in a lovely smile. 
</P>
<P>
 SHE: Fashion gurus are saying that kids will make a good impression if they 
have these five essentials in their back-to-school wardrobes: a pair of jeans, 
a backpack, a bright plaid shirt, hiking boots and a colorful jacket.

<P>
 Well, I'm no kid, but even I have the jeans, the bright plaid shirt and the 
colorful jacket. Now all I need are some boots and a backpack. And a lovely 
smile that involves my entire face, of course.

CLOSET RX; HOW JEWELRY CAN BE ACCESSORY TO A CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 People who like rules and order should stay out of the fashion game. Gone are 
the days when all skirts conformed to a general hemline and corduroy was put on 
with the first falling leaves of autumn. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, many of the traditional "laws" regarding what to wear have been thrown 
out the window. One of the biggest questions is how to determine which jewelry 
goes with what ensemble, and there isn't always a simple answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It used to be easier to match jewelry with an outfit," says Sandy Miller of 
Twice the Style in Costa Mesa. "Now there are so many choices, but there are 
still a few things to keep in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Balance is the key word. Beautiful dangling earrings don't go with a flashy 
necklace. "No matter how beautiful or expensive a piece of jewelry is, its 
purpose is to enhance the clothes you're wearing and not take anything away 
from them," Miller says. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the oldest no-no's still applies -- don't mix metals. "Wearing your 
silver bangles with a gold belt buckle just doesn't look right," Miller says. 
"The only time it works is if there's some gold in the bangles and some silver 
in the buckle." 
</P>
<P>
 It's easy to forget to check clothing as well. "Many outfits have gold or a 
metallic trim; you have to be aware that you're not clashing with them," says 
Stephanie Grani of Stephania in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Metallic colors also create some confusion. Do you wear gold with a rust 
jacket or silver with your pewter shoes? "We have an outfit on display that's 
called 'flame' -- it's a combination of gold and rust. The necklace we use is 
gold, but the earrings are copper and gold. All three colors are picked up in 
the outfit," Grani says. 
</P>
<P>
 Use your best eye and hold up the jewelry to the clothing to see if you can 
wear it together. 
</P>
<P>
 You've probably already noticed that some outfits look better with silver 
jewelry, while others are more attractive with gold. "Silver tends to work 
better with the 'cool' colors -- magenta, some blues, purple, while gold works 
with 'warm' tones -- yellow, some reds," Grani says. 
</P>
<P>
 Another factor to consider is skin tone and hair color, especially regarding 
earrings and necklaces. "You may love some particular gold earrings, but they 
may not be you," Grani says. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, her staff has discovered that darker colored hair and skin looks 
best with silver jewelry while lighter colored hair or skin looks best with 
gold. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've seen the recent magazine shots of models wearing fancy jewelry with 
casual outfits, you've already spotted the latest trend. Rather than relying on 
rules, you may have to use your creativity when opening up the jewelry box. 
</P>
<P>
 "Experiment with different looks," says Lisa Valeriano of Twice the Style. 
"Sometimes a piece you never thought would go with an outfit looks great. You 
just need to give it a try."

BEHIND THE SCENES: REVEALING MASK APPEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A mask can reveal as much as it can conceal. It can serve as a window on our 
fantasies and dreams. We can be a star, mutant, bandit or super hero. A mask 
allows us to face up to our secret monsters and play the demon for fun. 
</P>
<P>
 Masks -- much like fashion -- let us express who we are. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Harbor Art Museum is hoping that art lovers will reach for a mask 
and reveal their support in coming weeks. The masks were created by more than 
100 leading contemporary artists for the Night of the Masque fund-raising gala 
Oct. 1 at Emporio Armani, South Coast Plaza, to benefit the museum.  
</P>
<P>
 About 150 patrons previewed the works at the Costa Mesa store last Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 The evening soiree also offered a sneak look at selections from Emporio 
Armani's fall collection. But among the crowd, the luscious shearing and skin 
coats proved no match against the array of wildly creative masks on display in 
the store windows. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum supplied a handmade form off which the artists could work, although 
some opted to forgo the traditional form altogether.  
</P>
<P>
 Sandow Birk boxed in a full-face ski hat in a plastic bag as evidence of the 
urban crime mask; Anna Silver painted three large ceramic plates; Steve Zoller 
created abstract features with resin that hint at a nose and mouth, and Eric 
Orr saturated sedua, copper with magnesium, gold and blood over a flat square. 
</P>
<P>
 Other artists explored the relationship between beauty and fashion. Gronk 
brushed a primitive tribal mask on the back of a denim jacket; Rachel Lachowicz 
brilliantly stacked 18 rectangular face powder cakes in a box, and a cast paper 
mask was stitched up like a baseball in what seems to allude to plastic surgery 
by artist Loren Madsen. 
</P>
<P>
 The masks will remain on display and silent bids accepted until the Oct. 1 
event, when Christie's auction house will preside over the proceedings. ROSE

STYLE FILE: BOXERS COME OUT IN THE WASH -- AND ELSEWHERE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY BRYANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They are called "Happy Face," "Breakfast in Bed" and "Ants in the Pants." 
Titles of contemporary paintings? 
</P>
<P>
 No. 
</P>
<P>
 They're names of boxer shorts. And not just any boxer shorts. These are 
designer shorts made from cotton, flannel and silk in colors that are as vivid 
as their names. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer does wearing shorts around the house conjure visions of 
"Honeymooner" Ralph Kramden. 
</P>
<P>
 The big news is that these boxers are coming out of the closet and into the 
open. Because many have buttons or snaps to avoid embarrassing situations, they 
can be worn around the house, to the beach or to the gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long ago a T-shirt was always worn underneath something else. Now, boxers 
are the logical next step in a man's march toward comfort clothes, says Peter 
Rasoe, manager of the Boxer Bay store in Fashion Island Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxers have also caught the attention of the opposite sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 70% of our clientele is women," Rasoe says. "Things are really getting 
unisex now with our smaller sizes going for women and with the women buying fun 
shorts for their husbands or boyfriends. They buy them primarily for presents 
and for gag gifts. At Christmas, a lot are sold for stocking stuffers." 
</P>
<P>
 Boxers are emblazoned with "Happy Birthday" and "Holiday Greetings" as well as 
other personal greetings. One pair is decorated with pigs that glow in the 
dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have from 2,000 to 4,000 pairs of shorts in stock at any given time," 
Rasoe says. 
</P>
<P>
 Sold individually at prices from $12 to $21, these boxers are a long way from 
the three-pack of white cotton briefs sold at discount stores for $6. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the boxer business has become big business, a trend many attribute to 
Calvin Klein. His underwear company enjoyed sales of $60 million last year and 
was recently sold to Warnaco, a giant apparel company, for a reported $64 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The emergence of boxer shorts as fashion has even conservative stores taking 
notice. Brooks Bros.' boxers come in red, yellow and blue stripes as well as 
plaids, and Polo Ralph Lauren has paisley prints and Scottish plaids. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's up to a guy to buy for himself, he usually chooses a conservative 
style," Rasoe says. KATHY BRYANT

HOT PROPS: NAVAL BASICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSE APODACA JONES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For fall, comfortable men's dressing invests its fabrics and forms in all that 
is "sturdy" at Armani Exchange. Heavy melton wool, alpaca, Shanghai twill and 
tweed are shaped into masculine classics. A "primary" palette of dusty brown, 
tan, stone and khaki accompanies navy, which dominates the collection. It's 
navy of another sort -- the oceanic variety filled with soldiers -- that also 
inspired Signor Armani. The uniform code for every closet: a navy wool melton 
military jacket ($295) and five-pocket jean ($125), band collar Bengal stripe 
shirt ($88), belt ($78) and work boots ($165). STUCK IN THE MUD 
</P>
<P>
 Mail-order is not something the folks at the Mount View Spa in Calistoga had 
ever considered. Not until a vacationing reporter from a major Midwestern 
newspaper "discovered" an in-house treatment -- the Fango Mud Bath -- and raved 
about it in an article. "We got calls the day the article came out and started 
filling orders right away," says spa director Katrine Kenyon. Fango (which 
means "wet earth" in Italian) is a dehydrated volcanic mud from the 
Mediterranean mixed with pine oil and salicyl -- a natural aspirin base 
sometimes used as a treatment for arthritis pain. The pine oil loosens muscle 
tissue, says Kenyon, allowing the salicyl to work deep into the muscle to 
alleviate aches. Afflicted with rheumatism, Kenyon's sister has benefited from 
a Fango dip: "It doesn't help her joints, but it takes care of the 
inflammation." Workout buffs can sink in after exercise. Fango is available 
through Mountain View Spa in one-, two- and three-ounce tubes ($1.50, $3 and 
$4.50, respectively) and in an economy 16-ounce bottle for $20. (The U.S. 
distributor sells it only in bulk to spas professionals.) Only an ounce is 
required per treatment for a regular home tub. TINY TEASE 
</P>
<P>
 Empowerment these days for many young women means taking symbols and words 
previously considered anti-feminist and wearing them like a badge of defiance. 
While some gals are taking to terms not suitable for publication, others are 
adopting a classier approach with the use of vintage pinups -- those fantasy 
pre-1950s embodiments of the perfect female bod. One sizzling seller is the 
line of Tees from Body and Soul featuring a small screen of a pinup on the top 
half of the shirt. Designer Lee Lopez lifted the illustrated illusions from a 
friend's collection of trading cards once available through cigarette packs. 
"I've always loved pinup girls. They seemed so beautiful." Although hesitant at 
first to go forward with the Tees, Lopez says she went with her gut instinct: 
"I think women are more relaxed and secure with themselves and are no longer 
scared to wear this sort of thing." Indeed the $22 Tees have been selling so 
briskly, Lopez has decided to give into requests from guys for larger sizes. 
Look out for them around the holidays; until then, women can find their sizes 
at Taxi Taxi in Costa Mesa. ROSE APODACA JONES

TWO DECADES LATER, THE VIETNAM WAR IS STILL A HOT TOPIC; HISTORY: THE SHOOTING 
HAS STOPPED, BUT THERE'S ENOUGH RESIDUAL INTEREST IN THE CONFLICT TO SUSTAIN A 
GLOSSY MAGAZINE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENTON ROBINSON, THE HARTFORD COURANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a sunny Sunday afternoon 30 years ago, three torpedo boats attacked the 
U.S. destroyer Maddox off the coast of North Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 The Maddox, which had entered the Gulf of Tonkin to spy on the North 
Vietnamese, escaped unscathed. But the skirmish -- and a second spurious 
incident reported two days later -- gave President Lyndon B. Johnson all the 
excuse he needed to lead the United States into its most unpopular war. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time the last American troops withdrew on March 29, 1973, the war had 
cost about 58,000 American lives, had torn the American commonwealth asunder 
and had left a litter of unanswered questions in its wake: How did this happen? 
Why did the United States lose? What does it mean? 
</P>
<P>
 The war did not end with the withdrawal of American troops. There was still 
the need to answer those questions, and to be reconciled to the loss. And so, 
even today, more than 20 years later, the battles are still being fought . . . 
on the pages of Vietnam magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go in-country six times a year to meet the enemy in the bush, villages, and 
rice paddies," reads Vietnam's advertising copy. 
</P>
<P>
 To the extent that this copy suggests this is a magazine for veterans who 
can't leave the war behind them, it is misleading. 
</P>
<P>
 True, Vietnam is a glossy, full-color bimonthly publication that carries 
advertisements for everything from commemorative AK-47s to T-shirts emblazoned 
with President (Taco Bill) Clinton kissing a Vietnamese Communist's behind. 
</P>
<P>
 And true, some of the articles take a definite political stance. The August 
issue, for example, included an essay by retired Air Force Col. Jacksel M. 
Broughton, who argues that the way the United States fought the air war in the 
Persian Gulf highlights the mistakes made in 'Nam. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, the magazine is a work of military history, focusing on 
the strategy, tactics, armament and battles of the Vietnam War, and written by 
veterans of the conflict and scholars who have studied it. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the August issue also included two exquisitely detailed 
minute-by-minute accounts of actions in the war. Retired Army Brig. Gen. James 
E. Shelton recounts the battle of Ong Thanh, and Army Reserve Lt. Col. James T. 
Root Jr. writes about the 1st Battalion, 12th Cavalry's victory over the North 
Vietnamese Army's 7th and 8th battalions, 18th Regiment, at Hoa Hoi. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided we wanted to tell the story," says Kenneth Phillips, the founding 
managing editor of Vietnam and now director of special projects for the Cowles 
History Group, which publishes Vietnam and nearly a dozen other historical 
magazines about everything from the Civil War to the Wild West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want to tell the politics of Vietnam," he says. "We didn't want to 
tell the whys and why nots. We wanted to tell the combative aspects of the 
Vietnam War, what our soldiers went through, who won which battles, that type 
of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean the magazine skirts the more painful issues. It has carried 
stories on My Lai, the Tet offensive, dissenters and both sides of the POW-MIA 
debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our ambition is to show the war in all its complexity," says retired Army 
Col. Harry G. Summers Jr., the magazine's editor. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine was launched in the summer of 1988, a time, Phillips says, when 
"the anxieties, the disappointments, all the bad things about Vietnam had kind 
of died down." 
</P>
<P>
 It was an immediate success. Within a year, the demand was such that the 
magazine went from four to six issues a year, and at its peak circulation went 
to a high of 190,000. Circulation has since leveled off but has stayed strong 
at about 160,000. 
</P>
<P>
 And where initially the greatest interest had come from veterans, the 
magazine's base of subscribers has grown to include all sorts of other people, 
including academics and, most recently, young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids now who are in their late teens, early 20s, their fathers, 
grandfathers fought the Vietnam War," Phillips says. "So they have a personal 
interest in it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Subscribers are generally not veterans obsessed with their past, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real soldier in Vietnam came back like most soldiers and put on his work 
clothes and went back to work, and he's the lawyer and he's the doctor and he's 
this, this, this and this," Phillips says. "He's not the guy that's still 
complaining about the war and saying, 'I can't get my life back together.' 
That's not a strong majority of our readership." 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to hit the middle ground," Summers says. The magazine is "not a 
scholarly magazine which is so dense as to be unreadable," nor is it a " 
'Soldier of Fortune' bang-bang shoot-'em-up. We try to avoid first-person 
accounts, though every once in a while we'll have one in there, but we'd rather 
have more dispassionate accounts that explain what happened, why and all the 
rest." 
</P>
<P>
 Summers says the magazine is putting the war into perspective, something that 
Summers himself has a lot of. He's a veteran of Korea and Vietnam. He was one 
of the last men off the U.S. embassy roof when Saigon fell to the Communists in 
1975. He has also written a number of books, including "On Strategy: A Critical 
Analysis of the Vietnam War." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the characteristics of the Vietnam generation is the lack of 
historical perspective," he says. "I mean the baby boomer is sort of like the 
Christmas goose: They wake up in a new world every morning and think that the 
world began with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to give some perspective to the Vietnam experience, because in my own 
view that's what the Vietnam vet needs more than anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips puts it another way: Vietnam magazine is about healing. 
</P>
<P>
 Once people understand what American soldiers went through in Vietnam, he 
says, they see them in a different light. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a woman call in here who wanted us to publish a letter of hers. Now 
this has happened more times than once, but this one particular woman I'll 
never forget. She said, 'Back in the '60s I was one of those people who spit on 
the soldier that came back and called him a baby killer and a murderer. But 
after reading your magazine and seeing what he went through, I want to 
apologize to the soldier.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And the magazine, Phillips says, is a long-overdue tribute to that soldier. 
</P>
<P>
 "The average Vietnam soldier went over there for one reason and one reason 
only. He went over there because of Mom and apple pie, the whole nine yards, 
you know what I mean? Because he loved his country and he believed that his 
country was sending him over there for a reason, and that was to win a war. And 
he came back and did not receive the recognition he should have. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Vietnam War will go down in history as a loss, but I can tell you one 
thing, this boy doesn't think that the Vietnam soldier lost the war." 
</P>

 Musicians and music buffs gathered for a champagne reception on Tuesday night 
at the Virgin Megastore in Costa Mesa to celebrate the release of the Pacific 
Symphony's new compact disc on the KOCH International label.

 Said longtime orchestra supporter Marcy Mulville: "The CD is a wonderful thing 
for us. It will help people acknowledge who we are, introduce them to our 
marvelous musicians and the kind of music we are giving to Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 Texas-born Carl St.Clair, sporting snakeskin boots and a graying crop of long 
hair, mingled with the orchestra's composer in residence, Frank Ticheli, and 
Mark Johnson, who helped underwrite the CD with a donation of $50,000, next to 
a rack stocked with the CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't play it safe with this project," St.Clair said, smiling. "This CD 
put everybody on the line. Technically, it demanded virtuosity from everyone."

BOFA RANKS HIGH IN MUTUAL FUNDS SERVICE; BANKING: A SURVEY LISTS GREAT WESTERN 
AND WELLS FARGO AMONG THE WORST. THEY AND OTHERS AT BOTTOM OF THE STANDINGS 
DISPUTE THE RESULTS.

 A major national survey of the way financial institutions sell mutual funds 
and other securities gave high marks for disclosure and customer service to 
Bank of America, while ranking Great Western and Wells Fargo among the worst 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
 The California-based institutions were among 50 major banks and thrifts 
surveyed by "mystery" shoppers for a market research firm in San Francisco, 
which asked for advice on how to invest $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost half the time, banking personnel failed to ask the prospective 
customers about their income or tax brackets -- vital information for 
determining appropriate investments, according to Scott Galloway, head of 
Prophet Market Research. 
</P>
<P>
 Galloway said women were often treated as "inferior prospects" -- they found 
it harder to arrange a meeting with a bank representative and were less likely 
to be informed that bank securities investments lack the federal insurance 
protection given to deposits of up to $100,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial institutions that ranked low in the survey vigorously disputed the 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks and savings and loans have moved aggressively in recent years into the 
sale of mutual funds, securities and other uninsured investments. Financial 
industry deregulation has allowed the depository institutions to expand the 
range of products, but banking regulators want to ensure that financial 
institutions fully disclose the risks to customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Prophet Market Research did a study commissioned by Money 
magazine, which included 100 visits to 33 institutions. But the latest survey, 
which the market research firm conducted on its own this summer, was a more 
extensive effort and included 400 visits to branch offices of 50 of the biggest 
banks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are selling it to whoever will pay for it, from the banks to the American 
Assn. of Retired Persons to the insurance lobby," Galloway said. "There is no 
spin on the data. We try to be brutally honest and non-biased." The detailed 
survey is being offered to banks for $15,000. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Galloway, the shoppers, who ranged in age from their 30s to their 
70s, were specially chosen and trained to "look, smell and feel like the 
customer base" of the banks. 
</P>
<P>
 After visiting the financial institutions, they prepared reports on 48 topics, 
ranging from the convenience of the proposed appointment to the way in which 
the investment representative explained bond quality ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 The banks were given a grade that could have been as high as 100, based on the 
weighted series of questions. Scores ranged from 66.9 to 91.4. 
</P>
<P>
 Among California institutions, Bank of America was third on the list of 50, 
with a score of 87.6. The mean industry ranking for the 50 banks was 78.8 
</P>
<P>
 Among other California financial institutions, First Nationwide (78.9), 
Glendale Federal (78.8), American Savings (77.0) and Cal Federal (77.0) were 
all grouped in the "average" category. First Interstate (74.7) was listed 
"below average," and Great Western (70.6) and Wells Fargo (70.2) were in the 
"worst" category." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, the banks' response to the report usually varied according 
to where they ranked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we're very pleased because it means the things we have been 
instituting are working and are recognized by the customers," said Rick Clark, 
Bank of America's senior vice president and director of sales and marketing for 
brokerage activities. The bank emphasizes when training its brokers that they 
must be "pristine in the approach to disclosure," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Great Western Financial, "we strongly disagree with the results of the 
survey, and we believe we are in full compliance," said Steve Hawkins, vice 
president and director of public relations. "The whole issue of compliance is a 
high priority for us, and our own internal surveys are completely contradictory 
to the findings of this survey." 
</P>
<P>
 Wells Fargo, which previously had been praised by the Comptroller of the 
Currency for its disclosure policies, challenged the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We communicate with every one of our customers who purchases a 
non-traditional product," said executive vice president Dudley Nigg. "We ask 
them these kinds of questions. Our results indicate the overwhelming majority 
are very clear about what they've got and very comfortable with what they've 
got." 
</P>
<P>
 Other financial institutions that finished near or at the bottom also disputed 
the study. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe our sales practices are proper. We fully disclose everything the 
customer should know," said Robert Stickler, a spokesman for Florida-based 
Barnett Banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Bayliss, senior vice president at Boatmen's Bancshares in St. Louis, 
said: "We put no credence in the study. We feel our program is excellent, and 
we challenge the survey." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at First Virginia Bank in suburban Washington and Texas Commerce 
Bank in Houston also said their banks make vigorous efforts to comply with all 
disclosure rules, and they disagreed strongly with the Prophet findings. 
Officials at Chemical Bank in New York could not be reached for comment. Bank 
Rankings 
</P>
<P>
 Bank of America ranked among the best and Great Western Bank and Wells Fargo 
ranked among the worst in a survey of the way in which the nation's financial 
institutions market their mutual funds to the public. The "mystery shopper" 
survey, conducted by a market research firm in San Francisco, sought to grade 
how forthcoming the financial institutions were in disclosing that these 
investments were not government-insured.

AIRLINES, BOEING DEFEND SAFETY RECORD OF THE 737 JETLINER; AEROSPACE: MORE THAN 
2,600 OF THE INDUSTRY WORKHORSES HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED SINCE THEIR 
INTRODUCTION IN 1967. 
</P>

 Airlines with big fleets of Boeing 737 jetliners -- the best-selling 
commercial aircraft in history -- defended the plane's safety Wednesday even as 
investigators remained baffled one week after a USAir 737-300 crashed in clear 
weather near Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Pockets of the public remained less confident, however, as certain airline 
passengers continued asking not to be placed on 737s following the crash last 
Thursday, some travel agents said. But other agents said such calls ceased days 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real hit-and-miss," said Thomas Nulty, president of Santa Ana-based 
Associated Travel Management, which has 100 offices nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 While also defending the plane as safe, Boeing is trying to help find the 
crash's mysterious cause by using data from the ill-fated plane's flight data 
recorder and other information to re-create the flight on company simulators in 
Seattle and Renton, Wash., where the 737s are built. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred when the jet, on a routine approach to the Pittsburgh 
airport, suddenly plunged from the sky and slammed into a wooded ravine. All 
132 people on board were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators speculated early that the thrust of one engine might have been 
suddenly reversed, or that an engine might have broken loose. But closer 
inspections cast doubt on both theories, and authorities are again ruling 
nothing out. 
</P>
<P>
 Boeing has delivered more than 2,600 of the planes since their debut in 1967. 
Airlines covet the 737 because of its price ($30 million to $44 million), 
modest maintenance costs, fuel efficiency and reliability. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, about 160 airlines use the aircraft for 17,000 flights worldwide. 
That widespread usage has increased the pressure on Boeing to help find the 
cause of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 One Boeing insider, who asked not to be identified, said engineers there have 
concluded that "since there was no obvious, glaring cause, this was going to be 
a long and detailed investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 He also said there was no sense among Boeing's staff that the 737's sterling 
reputation was in danger of being tarnished. 
</P>
<P>
 But an executive of a rival airplane manufacturer, who also requested 
anonymity, said that "there's always a great emotional involvement" for an 
aircraft maker following such a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a stunner, no matter how many times you've been through it," he said. 
"It's a shock because we like to think we've built the best airplane we can, 
and when it goes wrong, that's a hard kick. But then life goes on, and you have 
to focus on what went wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The USAir crash has not prompted Boeing to order any changes to existing 737s, 
nor have any Boeing customers canceled or otherwise altered their orders for 
the twin-engine plane, said spokesman Steve Thieme. About 380 of the jets are 
currently on order, he noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Two airlines with large 737 fleets, Southwest and United, both said they've 
made no changes related to the 737. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are operating status quo," said Linda Rutherford, a spokeswoman for 
Dallas-based Southwest, whose 194-plane fleet is entirely 737s. Southwest, a 
low-cost specialist in flying short-hop routes, has never had a fatal crash in 
its 23-year history. 
</P>
<P>
 United, the nation's largest carrier, has 227 of the jets, which account for 
41% of its total fleet. Asked if United considers the plane unsafe, spokesman 
Joe Hopkins replied, "Not at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Janssens, president of the Aviation Safety Institute of Worthington, Ohio, 
said: "This is a tragic accident and, yes, it needs to be thoroughly 
investigated, but it's an anomaly and is one of those one-in-a-million chances 
that is a risk of the industry."

BAGGING A DEAL; ALPHA BETA'S PARENT FINALIZES PLAN TO BUY RALPHS CHAIN FOR $1.5 
BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Touting their union as a deal that will help them upgrade stores and escalate 
the local price war, the owner of Alpha Beta supermarkets on Wednesday 
completed a long-anticipated agreement to acquire 121-year-old Ralphs Grocery 
Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Yucaipa Cos., which also owns the Boys, Viva and Food 4 Less warehouse stores, 
signed a definitive agreement to acquire Ralphs from the Ohio-based DeBartolo 
Corp. for $1.5 billion. The combined company's value would be $2.5 billion, 
making the deal the largest supermarket merger in California history. 
</P>
<P>
 The pledge of lower prices is doubted by some antitrust experts, and the 
merger still faces scrutiny by state and federal regulators. If approved, the 
combined company would be the largest supermarket chain in Southern California 
with 27% of the market -- surpassing longtime leader Vons in sales and store 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The two firms, which had been in talks for more than a year, missed several 
informal deadlines in recent days because one of the six Ralphs shareholders, 
Paris-based Banque Paribas, had withheld approval. But that impasse was 
resolved Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies said they plan to combine their operations by November or 
December. Though Yucaipa is the acquiring company, Ralphs management would run 
the vast enterprise on a day-to-day basis -- an acknowledgment that Ralphs is 
the strongest of the five chains. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The combined entity is to be called Ralphs Grocery Co., and Yucaipa plans to 
convert all of its Alpha Beta, Boys and Viva markets to Ralphs or Food 4 Less 
warehouse stores. The new partners promised to improve service by adding staff 
at the stores and lowering prices, partly by converting some locations to the 
low-price Food 4 Less warehouse format. 
</P>
<P>
 Though consumer groups have voiced concern that the reduced number of players 
on the Southern California supermarket scene will mean higher prices, some 
customers seemed pleased to know that Ralphs would be in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's time to do major shopping, I never go to Alpha Beta," Irvine 
shopper Lisa Rodriguez said as she fed bottles and cans into Alpha Beta's 
recycling station. "I like the way the (Ralphs) store is laid out, I like the 
meat prices better, and they have a better selection." 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Yucaipa Chairman Ron Burkle would be chairman of the merged firm 
and Ralphs Chairman Byron Allumbaugh would become chief executive of the 
combined company. In interviews, they said they are converting the stores 
because Ralphs has a higher public profile than the younger Alpha Beta, Boys 
and Viva chains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ralphs has a very good image . . . and it doesn't make sense to operate under 
different names," Burkle said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ralphs President Al Marasca would be the new company's president, and George 
Golleher, president of Food 4 Less Supermarkets, the La Habra-based company 
that operates the chains controlled by Yucaipa, would become vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 They would oversee an enterprise that currently includes 167 Ralphs, 131 Alpha 
Betas, 24 Boys and 15 Viva stores, as well as 30 Food 4 Less warehouse stores. 
Some stores are expected to be closed and an undetermined number of jobs would 
be lost.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the conversion of all surviving conventional supermarkets to 
the Ralphs format, up to 30 of the Ralphs locations are to be converted to Food 
4 Less stores to better compete with existing warehouse stores and the 
anticipated challenge from Wal-Mart, which will be opening grocery operations 
in California under its "superstore" format. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkle and Allumbaugh said that with two chains -- Ralphs and Food 4 Less 
warehouse stores -- instead of the current five, the company can save $100 
million annually by consolidating administrative and distribution functions. It 
can also slash advertising budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take the cost savings and pass them along to consumers," Burkle said.  
</P>
<P>
 The companies said they have not yet determined how many jobs would be 
eliminated. The headquarters for the combined company is to be at Ralphs 
current corporate offices in Compton. A smaller staff would continue to work at 
the Food 4 Less Supermarket offices in La Habra, the executives said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new company would have annual sales of more than $5.3 billion, the 
partners said. The $1.5-billion price includes Yucaipa's assumption of nearly 
$1 billion of Ralphs' debt. They said the transaction also includes the 
purchase of additional equity by Apollo Advisers, a minority investor in Food 4 
Less Supermarkets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Trade Commission and California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren are 
conducting reviews to determine whether consumers would be helped, hurt or 
unaffected by the mega-deal. The officials could block the merger or, more 
likely, force the combined company to sell some stores on antitrust grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking a very close look at it," said Lawrence Tapper, deputy state 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, some local supermarket chains have been forced to pare down 
merger plans in the face of opposition from regulatory agencies. For example, 
though Alpha Beta's former corporate parent, American Stores, was permitted to 
merge Alpha Beta stores with Lucky markets in Northern California in 1991, it 
was forced to sell 145 Alpha Beta stores in Southern California to Yucaipa. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the major competitors of the planned new company had no comment on the 
merger, but one supermarket executive who requested anonymity said a combined 
Ralphs-Food 4 Less would have too great a presence in certain neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential for price gouging is greater when you dominate an area," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The new entity would respond to any competitive price cutting with promotions 
of their own, to lure customers of Alpha Beta, Boys and Viva sites that are 
converted to Ralphs and Food 4 Less formats, executives at the two companies 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some real estate brokers said there appears to be relatively little 
overlap between the two operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two companies are working different neighborhoods, so to speak," said 
Ted Lawson, a senior vice president with CB Commercial in Torrance. "Food 4 
Less is working its way up, Ralphs is working its way down, and they share some 
middle zones. So there might not be a lot of duplication. I don't see them 
dropping stores unless they're on the same block." Market Merger 
</P>
<P>
 The merger of Ralphs Grocery and Yucaipa, which owns Food 4 Less, Alpha Beta, 
Viva and Boys markets, has created Southern California's largest supermarket 
chain.

INNOVATION / MICHAEL SCHRAGE: AND ON YOUR LEFT, YOU CAN JUST MAKE OUT THE 
INSIGHTFUL COLUMNIST GENE 
</P>

By MICHAEL SCHRAGE, Michael Schrage is a writer, consultant and research 
associate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He writes this column 
independently for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The most important cartographers in the world these days don't work at Rand 
McNally or the CIA. They're not much interested in mountains and rivers and 
shifting national boundaries. In fact, they don't necessarily know much about 
traditional geography at all. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the influential map makers of the 1990s ply their trade in molecular 
biology labs, charting the geography of genes. They're rapidly creating a 
veritable atlas of human, plant and animal genes, figuring out where individual 
genes are located and what they do. 
</P>
<P>
 This is proving to be one of the most productive ventures in the history of 
cartography: gene mapping is transforming biology, agriculture and medicine as 
surely as mapping the New World transformed Europe. This year alone, 
researchers have located more than 45 new disease-causing genes in humans -- 
just yesterday, scientists announced the discovery of the gene that is believed 
to cause half of all inherited cases of breast cancer. The 
better-than-gene-a-week pace has helped spawn the biotech business boom. 
</P>
<P>
 But what good is an atlas without a guidebook? Alas, there are no Zagats or 
Guide Michelins for the genome just yet, no formal tours of the hot spots on 
uncharted chromosomes. To help rectify this problem, a few experts below point 
out their favorite sites on the gene map and explain where are the most 
interesting places to visit: 
</P>
<P>
 * "The HOX genes," offers Edward P. Lewis, the Thomas Hunt Morgan Professor of 
Molecular Biology at CalTech. "They are the only way an organism can make a 
head, thorax and abdomen. They do it by telling the other genes what to do. 
That part of the gene has not changed for over 500 million years." 
</P>
<P>
 * "LINE 1 and LRE1, LRE2 and LRE3," says Maxine Singer, a molecular biologist 
who is president of the Carnegie Institution of Washington and who has a lab at 
the National Cancer Institute. "They are places where active copies of the only 
known copies of human transposable -- so-called jumping genes -- are found. 
They're mutagenic when they jump: that is, they cause mutations and disease, 
like muscular dystrophy, when they move. They appear to be active in early 
embryonic cells. They're troublemakers, and I'm particularly interested in why 
these troublemakers have persisted for so long in the genome because of all the 
trouble they cause." 
</P>
<P>
 * " Rin ," says William R. Hyatt, the vice president of research and 
development for Calgene, the company that developed the genetically engineered 
FlavrSavr tomato. "It's a spot on the tomato locus and mutations map onto 
there. It's a natural mutant and it inhibits ripening. It's not so much a gene 
as it is a site. The point is, nobody knows exactly what this gene or locus is 
-- how it exerts this multitude of effects on the tomato and through what 
mechanism. We've only recently begun to clone it." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The sry gene of the Y chromosome," offers Robert L. Sinsheimer, an emeritus 
professor at UC Santa Barbara and a pioneer in the early days of bacterial 
virus research. "This was thought to be the central gene for determining 
maleness and femaleness. . . . There are also corresponding genes on the X 
(female) chromosome. We thought we understood which genes made you a boy or a 
girl. It seemed pretty clear and now it's confused." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The genes responsible for Type 1 diabetes," says venture capitalist Kevin 
Kinsella, who is also chief executive of La Jolla-based Sequana Therapeutics. 
"The sites are chromosomes 6, 11 and 18 and near HLA. There may be as many as 
five other genes implicated. I'm much more interested now in how gene complexes 
interact to produce a disease rather than just looking for single genes. The 
problem is finding all those multiple locations. So I think we're moving into a 
new era of gene discovery." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The ACC Synthase genes," suggests David Evans, business development vice 
president for DNA Plant Technology, which was involved in creating Brown & 
Williamson's Y-1 high nicotine tobacco. "They oversee the biosynthesis of 
ethylene. They control ripening and rotting. It's a gene family involved in 
part of the plant's defense mechanisms against disease. In some fruits, like 
bananas and tomatoes, there is a direct association between ethylene and fruit 
rotting. We're looking to suspend that." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The genes for the NMDA receptor," offers Daniel Koshland, a molecular 
biologist at UC Berkeley and the editor of Science magazine. "It's the receptor 
in the brain involved in how we record memory. I'm trying to understand the 
biochemical shift between short-term memory and long-term memory. We're looking 
for the gene for it. Where it is on the chromosome is not that important at the 
moment -- but it may be. I don't have any guarantees that its location is 
important but that may turn out to give us important insights. Sometimes gene 
geography can be very important." 
</P>
<P>
 * "The histone gene clusters," says Laurence Kedes, director of the Institute 
for Genetic Medicine at USC. "These are the genes that make the proteins that 
coat the chromosomes. They're the ones responsible for taking the threads of 
DNA and compacting them into cells. Otherwise, they would be yards long."

VIACOM PICKS TIME WARNER EXEC FOR TOP DEAL-MAKING POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In one of its most significant hires since buying Paramount Communications, 
Viacom Inc. named Time Warner executive Thomas McGrath on Wednesday to a top 
deal-making position in the group that oversees the company's movie studio, 
television operations and other entertainment units. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath, 39, was named to the new post of executive vice president of the 
Viacom Entertainment Group, in a move that had been rumored in entertainment 
circles since last month. He reports directly to Viacom Entertainment Chairman 
Jonathan L. Dolgen and will be based at the Paramount Pictures lot in 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate move, veteran TV executive Lucie S. Salhany was named president 
and chief executive of the United Paramount network, the fifth network the 
studio is launching. The Salhany move was also expected. The former Fox 
Broadcasting Co. chairwoman, who also served an earlier stint at Paramount, 
will report to an operating committee headed by Kerry McCluggage, who chairs 
the Paramount Television Group, and Evan Thompson, president of Chris-Craft's 
TV division. 
</P>
<P>
 Viacom's new executive, McGrath, was previously president of Time Warner 
International Broadcasting, and senior vice president of business development 
for Time Warner Inc.'s Home Box Office. His principal job was setting up 
television deals overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 In separate interviews, Dolgen and McGrath emphasized that McGrath's new job 
will not involve operations, but will emphasize the planning and implementation 
of strategic deals. McGrath added that he will not be involved in the 
individual film deals that studio executives traditionally negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources suggested that McGrath's most immediate task will be helping Viacom 
divest some assets, notably its 50% stake in the 350-screen Cineamerica chain 
of theaters -- known for its Mann Theaters -- and also its Famous Music 
publishing unit. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath is also likely to get involved in helping Paramount set up 
independently financed production deals at the studio, such as the recent one 
Dolgen negotiated with Douglas/Reuther Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Dolgen said he hired McGrath largely because of his "great transactional 
skills," noting that it's hard to find people with good deal-making abilities 
at a time when industry transactions are becoming increasingly sophisticated.

 Rhode Island Firm Mulling Possible Rival Offer for Borden: The Columbus 
Dispatch, an Ohio newspaper, reported that Paul Kazarian, chief of 
Providence-based Japonica Partners, was gauging support from Borden's

packaging company. Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. announced plans this week to 
buy Columbus-based Borden in a $2-billion stock-swap deal.

 Foreign Share of Japan's Chip Market Rises: Foreign computer chip makers 
grabbed a record 21.9% of Japan's market in the second quarter, the office of 
the U.S. trade representative said, surpassing the level set in a controversial 
U.S.-Japan microchip trade pact. This marked the third straight quarter that 
the foreign share of Japan's semiconductor market topped the critical 20% mark 
under the trade deal. The rise compares to a 20.7% share in the first quarter.

AUGUST RETAIL SALES SURGE 0.8%; JOB GROWTH IS CITED AS A FACTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Retail sales surged over a broad front last month after a quiet July. A 
government report said the economy is expanding at a healthy pace, with only 
moderate inflationary pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans bought cars, home furnishings and back-to-school supplies in August, 
the Commerce Department said Wednesday, and sales rose 0.8% after being flat 
the previous month. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the buying was stimulated by job growth and that there is still 
steam left in the consumer-driven expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The report is really quite positive for the economy," said economist Lynn 
Reaser of First Interstate Bancorp in Los Angeles. "The consumer has definitely 
not stalled out." 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy has nine lives, and maybe there are a couple of more to go," said 
Sung Won Sohn of Norwest Corp. in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 The optimism was bolstered by a Federal Reserve Board report on its survey of 
business conditions around the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economic activity continued to expand through the summer," it said. "Regions 
that have been lagging are generally said to be doing better, while most of the 
stronger areas saw growth plateau." 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, conducted by the Fed's 12 regional banks, found higher interest 
rates having an impact, particularly by slowing home construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called beige book report said spending is slowing but remains strong 
and that retailers look forward to a good holiday shopping season this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed, which has boosted short-term interest rates five times this year to 
head off inflation, was fairly optimistic about prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more reports of tightening labor markets than before, though wage 
pressures are still described as modest," the report said. "Industrial 
materials prices edged up further, but businesses say that competitive 
pressures continue to restrain price increases on finished goods." 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said they expect the Fed to raise interest rates again, but not until 
its November meeting -- after the elections. Retail Sales

LENDERS AGREE TO WIDEN OPPORTUNITIES

 A trade group representing more than 3,000 mortgage lenders across the nation 
signed an agreement with the federal government Wednesday aimed at making more 
loans to buyers in poor neighborhoods and increasing the number of minorities 
who work in the banking business. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact, signed by officials of the Mortgage Bankers Assn. of America and the 
Department of Housing and Urban Development, will also require lenders to 
designate a loan officer or department to handle consumer complaints and 
monitor their progress in making more loans to disadvantaged borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 HUD Secretary Henry G. Cisneros, who signed the agreement with MBA President 
Stephen B. Ashley, called it a milestone in the Clinton Administration's 
efforts to broaden homeownership opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros also praised the Washington-based banking trade group for accepting a 
voluntary program instead of waiting for a government mandate. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are limits to what can be accomplished through statutory requirements 
and their enforcement, which is reactive, time-consuming, costly and too often 
narrowly confined to specific cases," Cisneros said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500 of the 3,000 mortgage bankers covered by the pact do business in 
California, the banking trade group said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement does not create any new loan programs for poor or minority 
borrowers, but requires the lenders to do a better job of telling borrowers 
about such programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the voluntary agreement does not carry the force of law, most 
mortgage bankers have said they will abide by it -- in part because they fear 
that otherwise the government would impose mandatory guidelines that are even 
more strict and cumbersome. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal Community Reinvestment Act already requires most commercial banks 
and savings and loans to adhere to many of the elements in the agreement signed 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, mortgage bankers -- who specialize in making home loans and do not 
offer traditional banking services such as savings and checking accounts -- are 
not covered by the federal legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mortgage bankers hope the new agreement will fend off expansion of the 
CRA to their own industry. U.S. Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.) has set a 
Sept. 29 hearing to discuss such an expansion.

JUDGE CUTS AWARD IN SCALDING-COFFEE SUIT TO $640,000

 A $2.9-million verdict won by a woman who was scalded when she tried to pry 
the lid off a cup of McDonald's coffee was cut by a judge Wednesday to 
$640,000. 
</P>
<P>
 State District Judge Robert Scott ruled that the $2.7 million in punitive 
damages awarded to 81-year-old Stella Liebeck was excessive, and he reduced the 
amount to $480,000. He let stand $160,000 in compensatory damages awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he arrived at $480,000 figure for punitive damages by tripling 
the $160,000 compensatory award. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a jury ruled against McDonald's Corp. and in favor of Liebeck, who 
suffered third-degree burns on her legs, groin and buttocks in 1992 when she 
spilled coffee on her lap.

 Japan's Overall Trade Surplus Narrows: The Japanese Finance Ministry's report 
for August says the shrinkage was the biggest in four years, but the ministry 
said it is too soon to tell if a trend is developing. The value of exports in 
excess of imports, measured before seasonal adjustment, dropped 19% last month 
to the equivalent of $6.08 billion, from $7.49 billion in August, 1993, the 
ministry said.

STATE OKS 20TH CENTURY'S AUTO COVERAGE RATE HIKE; INSURER: QUAKE-RELATED LOSSES 
WILL NOT EXCUSE PROP. 103 REBATE DEBT. SOME OF PAYMENT IS TO AID THE OAKLAND 
AREA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi on Wednesday approved a controversial 6% 
increase in auto insurance rates for earthquake-battered 20th Century 
Industries' insurance units, 20th Century Insurance Co. and 21st Century 
Casualty Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The rate hike will add $49 a year to the average premium for 20th Century's 
1.15 million auto policyholders. The change is effective immediately, but for 
practical purposes it will not be enacted until early October, a 20th Century 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase is designed to generate an additional $56 million a year in 
revenues, some of which is meant to bolster the Woodland Hills-based company's 
surplus fund, or cushion against losses, which has been diminished to pay 
claims from the Northridge earthquake of Jan. 17. The 6% rate increase will 
drop to 3% as soon as the company's surplus is equal to a third of annual 
premiums -- a level regulators consider financially secure. Currently, the 
reserve amounts to less than one-fifth of annual premium payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi also affirmed Wednesday that, despite 20th Century's weakness, he 
intends to collect the full $119 million in rebates owed to policyholders under 
the Proposition 103 insurance rate rollback law. Garamendi's 1991 rebate order 
was upheld unanimously by the state Supreme Court on Aug. 18. "The amount of 
the rebate is not negotiable," Garamendi said in a statement, "but, as part of 
our financial discussions with the company, we are considering different 
payment plans for the company to pay its obligation." 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual part of the settlement announced Wednesday among 20th Century, 
Garamendi and two consumer groups that intervened in the rate filing, 20th 
Century agreed to help support economic development in the Oakland area by 
depositing $1 million of its surplus in banks there, and by donating $50,000 to 
nonprofit community activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 103, passed by a ballot initiative in 1988, strengthened the power 
of consumer organizations to intervene on the public's behalf at hearings about 
insurance rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The Personal Insurance Federation of California, a trade organization 
representing large insurance companies, attacked that part of the settlement 
Wednesday, saying that it sets a dangerous precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every rate filing is now up for some sort of extortive action by any -- quote 
-- consumer activist -- close quote -- who wants to come in the door," 
federation spokesman Dave Fountain said. He added: "The result is that it's 
going to slow down the process and add costs for the policyholder." 
</P>
<P>
 Selwyn Whitehead, president of the Oakland-based Economic Empowerment 
Foundation, one of the intervening groups, defended the bank deposits and cash 
contribution as a "nominal token of good faith" from 20th Century, which also 
promised to expand its marketing in urban areas outside Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 103 author Harvey Rosenfield criticized the settlement for another 
reason. Since part of the rate hike will amount to auto policyholders making a 
"forced investment" to prop up 20th Century's quake-ravaged reserves, the 
policyholders ought to get their money back with interest after the company's 
finances improve, Rosenfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, in a telephone interview Wednesday, said: "Proposition 103 
specifically states that we (regulators) must take a company's solvency into 
consideration in setting rates, so we did." 
</P>
<P>
 In its latest revised estimate, released last week, 20th Century said it faces 
$815 million in gross claims costs related to the Northridge quake. The 
reduction of the company's surplus from $582 million at the end of 1993 to less 
than $150 million raises questions about its ability to survive without a major 
infusion of equity or sale of the company.

 Blue-chip stocks ended with strong gains for the second session in a row 
Wednesday as the market grew more confident that inflation will not be a threat 
to the economy for the rest of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average closed up 15.47 at 3,895.34 after gaining 
nearly 20 points on Tuesday. In the broader market, advancing issues led 
declines 1,081 to 1,041 on active volume of 298.53 million shares on the New 
York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said investors were more willing to buy stocks after the Federal 
Reserve Board said the economy's brisk expansion was starting to level off in 
response to rising interest rates since the start of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In the central bank's latest "beige book" summary of the business activity, 
the Fed said consumer spending was waning and the five Fed-engineered 
interest-rate rises this year were causing sales and construction of new homes 
to slacken. 
</P>
<P>
 The data, which will be used when the Fed next meets on Sept. 27 to consider 
more interest-rate hikes, comes just one day after news that consumer prices 
rose by just 0.3% in August, the same as in the previous two months. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just shows that (inflation) is still moderate at the consumer level and 
probably means the Fed is not going to have to raise interest rates anytime 
soon," said Bruce Bittles, market strategist at J. C. Bradford. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said some of the market's activity was attributable to computer-driven 
program trades prior to Friday's triple expiration of equity and index options 
and index futures. They also cited position-squaring ahead of the Yom Kippur 
holiday on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said they thought the stock market was showing upside momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Battipaglia, chief investment strategist at Gruntal & Co., said he 
thought there was "latent buying power" on Wall Street, built up in recent 
investor bearishness, that will drive stocks higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, crude oil futures tumbled to their lowest point in four months 
Wednesday as the nation's refineries churned out increasingly large supplies of 
heating oil and gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 The October light sweet crude oil contract at the New York Mercantile Exchange 
settled at $16.71 for a loss of 41 cents a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, interest rates finished slightly lower. The Treasury's 
benchmark 30-year bond yield ended the day at 7.67%, down slightly from 
Tuesday's 7.68%. Its price ended up 1/8 point, or $1.25 per $1,000, in face 
value. Prices and yields move in opposite directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>

SEC TO CRACK DOWN ON DISHONEST BROKERS IN SMALL-, MID-SIZED FIRMS; SECURITIES: 
AGENCY, NASD AND STOCK EXCHANGES ARE CRITICIZED FOR MOVING TOO SLOWLY TO 
PROTECT INVESTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOT J. PALTROW, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission disclosed Wednesday that it plans to 
launch a sweep of small- and medium-sized brokerage firms across the country to 
ferret out evidence of dishonest stockbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. announced the sweep at a congressional hearing 
looking into the problem of "rogue" stock brokers who repeatedly defraud small 
investors. Over the next six to eight months, he said, the SEC staff will visit 
"scores" of brokerage firm branch offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Levitt said the sweep will be similar to a series of examinations the SEC has 
carried out at the nation's nine largest brokerage houses. In May, the agency 
said the earlier sweep had led it to open 40 formal disciplinary 
investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "To those who would prey on unsuspecting investors, this is a warning: Clean 
up your act, or we'll do it for you," Levitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the hearing, Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the House 
subcommittee on telecommunications and finance, sharply criticized the National 
Assn. of Securities Dealers, the New York Stock Exchange and the SEC, which 
often take years to bring cases against brokers who blatantly violate 
securities laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to specific cases involving small investors, Markey termed the 
agencies' response "glacial." 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC probes and the House hearing follow a 1992 series in The Times which 
reported that several of the nation's most respected brokerage firms knowingly 
hired and retained brokers who had long records of defrauding customers. The 
series reported that regulators, including the stock exchanges, often took 
years to bring charges against brokers, while the brokers went on to victimize 
many more customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Investor advocates and securities industry officials clashed at the hearing 
over the extent of problems with rogue brokers and inadequate supervision by 
brokerages. Marc E. Lackritz, president of the Securities Industry Assn., said 
it was a "grotesque mischaracterization of this industry" to suggest that more 
than a tiny fraction of the nation's 470,000 brokers are dishonest. 
</P>
<P>
 But a state securities regulator and an official of the General Accounting 
Office said the extent of the problem could be much greater than is currently 
known. Many informal disciplinary actions against brokers are never reported, 
they said, and the central computer system for tracking brokers' records is 
severely outmoded. (The system will soon be overhauled.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't personally believe that this industry is populated with thousands of 
criminals and bad actors who should be placed in jail. Nor do I feel there are 
very many (brokers) walking around with halos," Levitt said. "But I do believe 
that there are lots of brokers who are walking pretty close to the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Mary E. Murray, 75, a widow and retired Latin teacher from Cape Cod, Mass., 
testified that over a five-year period ending in 1990, a Prudential Securities 
broker "churned" her $99,000 account -- ultimately costing her over $125,000 in 
losses. Churning involves rapidly buying and selling securities to generate 
commissions for the broker. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, arbitrators awarded Murray a $419,000 judgment against Prudential and 
the broker, Gerald R. Swirsky, criticizing their "open-eyed, reckless 
disregard" of Murray's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the NASD nor NYSE has taken disciplinary action against Swirsky, 
though an official testified that the NASD expected to file charges soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Now a broker with Tucker Anthony in Boston, Swirsky has been the subject of 
other formal complaints. Reached by phone after the hearing, he declined 
comment.

ON THE MOVE / CAROL SMITH: EXECUTIVE TRAVEL; WHAT DO BUSINESS TRAVELERS WANT? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 How do business travelers feel about hitting the road, and what do they want 
when they do? 
</P>
<P>
 Two recent surveys by hotel chains provide some clues to the preferences, 
attitudes and pet peeves of those who have to travel frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent survey of 1,000 business travelers by New Hampshire-based Omni 
Hotels, an international hotel chain, 85% of the respondents said they enjoyed 
business travel because it offered a change of pace from their regular work 
life. The lifestyle survey, which was conducted by Nationwide Surveys Inc. in 
Miami, also shows that nearly half (47%) said they enjoyed the opportunity to 
eat at higher-priced restaurants while traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 However, 85% also said they would prefer to have their spouse or children with 
them on most trips, and one in three agreed with the statement "I feel guilty 
being away from home when traveling on business." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps because of that, 60% of travelers who left children at home brought 
gifts back from each trip. 
</P>
<P>
 An even greater percentage of travelers with children at home (73%) tried to 
call home every night. In contrast, 60% of business travelers in general tried 
to phone every night to stay in touch. 
</P>
<P>
 Business travelers are particular about the honor bars in their hotels. Both 
men and women picked sodas as their drink of choice (29%). However, more men 
than women said they would also like domestic beer (20% compared to 4% of 
women), nuts (14% compared to 4%), imported beer (8% compared to 4%) and liquor 
or spirits (9% compared to 6%). 
</P>
<P>
 Women preferred bottled water (26% compared to 9% of men), wine or champagne 
(14% compared to 3%) and crackers or cookies (11% compared to 8%). 
</P>
<P>
 In another survey of 1,000 business travelers, conducted for Dallas-based 
Wyndham Hotels & Resorts, frequent business travelers were asked to list their 
Top 10 service complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 In order of aggravation, they were dirty tub or shower, rude servers in 
restaurants, phantom credit card charges added after their stays ended, having 
someone mistakenly checked into their rooms after they were occupied, cleaning 
employees who don't knock before entering, missed wake-up calls, rude room 
service delivery people, unhelpful front desk personnel, inaccurate phone 
messages and delayed attention to mechanical problems.  
</P>
<P>
 The Top 10 items business travelers are most likely to forget to pack (in 
order of most frequently forgotten) are a sewing kit, toothpaste, mouthwash, a 
travel iron, toothbrush, deodorant, hair dryer, comb, razor-shaving cream and 
curling iron. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Aggravations like these can make business travel stressful. Hotel Crescent 
Court, a Dallas-based luxury hotel owned by Rosewood Hotels & Resorts Inc., is 
conducting a search for the "most-stressed business traveler."  
</P>
<P>
 To apply, business travelers must complete an application form (available by 
writing "Search for the Most Stressed Business Traveler," 2828 Routh St., Suite 
680, Dallas, TX 75201) and include a one-page anecdote describing why they 
should be designated the most stressed-out traveler. The deadline is Oct. 1. 
For more information, call (214) 953-0808. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The winner will receive air fare, meals and lodging for seven days and six 
nights at Little Dix Bay in the British Virgin Islands, one of Crescent Court's 
sister properties. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the administrative assistant of the most stressed-out business 
traveler will receive air fare for two, accommodations and meals for four days 
and three nights at Hotel Crescent Court and its accompanying spa in Dallas.

 * Exchange Rates: The best exchange rates for the dollar overseas are not at 
hotel counters or airports but at automated teller machines that draw on your 
bank account back home, according to a survey made in 14 countries by 
Visa/Plus. 
</P>
<P>
 It found that using a U.S.-issued bank card to draw local currency out of an 
ATM was on average 43% cheaper than the money counter at the local airport and 
57% cheaper than using a local hotel.The reason: Bank card networks do so much 
business that they can afford to offer wholesale exchange rates.

 * Parking: Parking will cost you plenty at hotels in six cities around the 
world, says a new survey in Business Traveler International magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs have skyrocketed, with hotels cashing in on growing numbers of driving 
executives, especially in Europe. The survey included Dallas, Los Angeles, 
Amsterdam, Frankfurt, London and Paris. London was by far the most expensive 
city, with parking nearly $40 a day. L.A. came in at $9 to $16.50 a day.

running in more than 40 cities with Personal Travel Guide -- a new computer 
navigation system available this month on planes with FlightLink. 
</P>
<P>
 The on-screen maps give travelers the best route and directions at their 
destinations -- from a hotel to the closest ATM or Chinese restaurant, for 
example -- and even suggest the best form of transportation. FlightLink is on 
about 70 planes and will be aboard about 1,000 in 1995.

<P>
 China announced Wednesday that urban inflation continued to defy a 15-month 
government cooling-off program and rose to the highest level in more than five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Figures from the State Statistical Bureau show that August consumer retail 
prices in China's 35 major cities rose 27.1% from a year earlier, following an 
annual rise of 24.2% in July. The figures suggest that the government's goal of 
keeping 1994 inflation below 10% won't be realized.

DEBT-REDUCTION ACCORD SEEN AS BIG BOOST FOR POLAND; FINANCE: THE AGREEMENT CUTS 
BY ALMOST HALF THE $14 BILLION IN COMMUNIST-ERA OBLIGATIONS THE NATION OWES 
COMMERCIAL LENDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bankers from around the world signed a generous debt-reduction agreement with 
Poland on Wednesday, cutting by almost half the $14 billion in Communist-era 
obligations still owed to more than 400 commercial lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 The long-awaited agreement brings to an end almost 15 years of haggling over 
Poland's indebtedness and is expected to give an important boost to the 
country's economy, already one of Europe's fastest-growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Poland will now be in a much better position to exploit its economic 
potential because of the improved investment climate," said Bernd Klett, an 
Eastern European analyst with Deutsche Bank in Frankfurt, Germany. "The 
insecurity surrounding the foreign debt problem is now over." 
</P>
<P>
 Poland has lagged behind other Eastern European countries, namely the Czech 
Republic and Hungary, in attracting foreign investment, in large part because 
of its poor repayment record. The Polish government at times has unilaterally 
stopped making payments on its debt service, which made it difficult for 
would-be investors to obtain new loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, which takes effect Oct. 27, Poland must adhere to a 
strict 30-year repayment schedule for its remaining debt, paying $375 million 
to its creditors next year and as much as $600 million in future years. 
</P>
<P>
 In return, the banks have agreed to reduce the country's commercial debt by 
49.2%, making the deal one of the most generous debt-reduction packages 
negotiated by the "London Club," a group of commercial lenders. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big deal for Poland," said Markus Rodlauer, chief of the Warsaw 
office of the International Monetary Fund, which has agreed to help Poland 
cover the $1.9-billion initial cost of the deal. "This should be the final 
chapter in the country's normalizing relations with its creditors." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators from both sides said they were under intense political pressure to 
reach an agreement because of a decision three years ago by Western governments 
to cut Poland's non-commercial foreign debt by about 50%, but only if 
commercial lenders agreed to do the same. The "Paris Club" -- a group of 
government lenders -- was eager to ease Poland's payment obligations to help 
soften the transition to a market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both sides, let's say, suffered to a certain extent from the politics," said 
Ernst-Moritz Lipp of Dresdner Bank, chief negotiator for the London Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the turning point in the most recent phase of negotiations, 
which has lasted four years, came last fall when the chairmanship of the 
negotiating team passed from U.S. to European banks. 
</P>
<P>
 Polish negotiators complained that non-European commercial lenders treated 
Poland as "a place they knew only from a computer screen," whereas European 
banks, particularly those in Germany, showed a far greater interest in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting that attitude, Bernhard Walter, a board member at Dresdner Bank, 
which shares the chairmanship with Lloyds Bank, said at the ceremony Wednesday 
that "we want to be there to help" as Poland's doors to foreign investment 
swing open. 
</P>
<P>
 E. Michael Hunter of Lloyds Bank also welcomed an expected surge in foreign 
banking activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the $14 billion owed by Poland to foreign commercial lenders, $8.7 billion 
was unpaid loans made to the Communist government in the 1970s, $1.1 billion 
was outstanding revolving credits from 1983 and 1984, and $4.2 billion was 
overdue interest accrued over the past five years.

 EU Jobless Rate Drops Modestly: The rate of unemployment in the European Union 
edged down to 10.8% in July, the second consecutive drop from the peak of 11% 
in May, according to Eurostat, the European Commission's statistics office. In 
a separate report on European employment, the commission warned that too many 
Europeans remain unemployed and that joblessness is not declining fast enough.

 Fugitive Mexican Financier's Del Monte Deadline Nears: Carlos Cabal Peniche 
could lose a $30-million deposit toward an attempted purchase of Del Monte 
Foods Corp. unless he comes up with $2 million more by next week, according to 
a U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filing. In June, Cabal agreed to buy 
San Francisco-based Del Monte and deposited $30 million, which will be 
forfeited unless he comes up with the additional funds by Sept. 19, according 
to Del Monte's registration statement filed with the SEC.Cabal disappeared 
after the Mexican government accused him of illegally diverting an estimated 
$700 million in loans from his banking company, Grupo Financiero Union. The SEC 
filing also shows that top Del Monte executives stand to make hefty bonuses on 
the sale to Cabal.

 MEXICAN STOCKS

<P>
 * Mexican stocks have rallied in the last two days after slipping Monday. The 
Bolsa index dropped after the presidential campaign to as low as 2,651.5 
points.Meanwhile, yields on the benchmark 28-day treasury bill fell for the 
first time in a month and the peso stopped its slide against the U.S. dollar. 
Traders now expect a quick renewal of the anti-inflation pact between 
government, business and labor. Details of the pact, which outlines wage raise 
limits and price controls, will give investors insight into the direction of 
the next president.

 * Mexican bottler Embotelladores del Valle de Anahuac has dropped plans to 
sell $50 million in shares and will sell debt instead.

 Little known to the world before World War II, this former Australian colony 
is now one of the world's fastest-growing economies because of the development 
of its resources. The island nation is seeking to use its mineral wealth -- a 
mother lode of gold, copper and petroleum -- as a means of integration with 
Asian economies.

MELINDA 2, JACKIE 0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I enjoyed the article on Melinda Lee and Jackie Olden ("Food Talk Radio," 
Sept. 1). George Nicholaw is correct. Olden should be replaced on 
weekends.There is no comparison in the food knowledge of the two ladies. Lee is 
far better in knowledge, voice and presentation.

 Melinda Lee charms me, but what I want to say about Jackie Olden would be 
considered an argument ad hominem. However, I can criticize her make-ahead 
potato recipe. How can you beat hot simmered potatoes into a sour cream and 
cream cheese mixture without doing something to the potatoes? Were they diced 
before simmering? Are they mashed, riced or pureed? Typical of Jackie's casual 
recipe style.

 Editor's Note: Actually, when we made the recipe in The Times Test Kitchen, 
the potatoes were cooked well enough that, when they were beaten into the other 
ingredients, they mashed pretty smoothly.

 The first thing I turn to in the Thursday Times is Jonathan Gold's Counter 
Intelligence article.Do not , as suggested by Nile Young's letter, have him 
upgrade the places he reviews. The sleazier the better! It's the 
hole-in-the-wall restaurants that offer the most flavorful, most interesting 
food. Let those interested in the homogenized food of restaurant row go to the 
safe, trendy places in Beverly Hills. The rest of us will be very happy 
following Mr. Gold's lead, thank you.

MORE MIKE ROY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a thrill it was to read the piece about Mike Roy and Denny Bracken ("Mike 
Roy, My Pop," Sept. 1). You have no idea what impact both of them had on my 
radio listening and my love for cooking. Although my father taught me the 
basics when I was a very young man, (Mike Roy) helped to hone my 
experimentation qualities in the kitchen. I remember so vividly your "papa" 
encouraging me (he had to know I was listening) to experiment in the kitchen 
and that you could still "eat your failure."

 What a delight to read the wonderful tribute to Mike Roy. Reading the article 
carried me back to the early '50s. My mom was honored by your dear pop to be a 
guest several times on his great cooking show. My mom passed away in January 
after celebrating her 102nd birthday. While going through her memorabilia, I 
found some fan letters from Mike Roy's Kitchen, sent by the grateful audience.

 I lived in Santa Monica and when I retired, I used to sit in my bedroom, knit, 
and listen to Mike and Denny (my sister in Houston got an afghan, the first 
item knitted). Mike taught me to make wine and I shall ever be grateful, as my 
brother drank what I made (instead of sleeping pills). He truly loved good food 
(or food well-prepared) and I used Mike's recipes as much as possible, mostly 
desserts. I continued making wine when we moved to Victorville in 1975. My 
brother died in 1990.

 Really enjoyed your article "Mike Roy, My Pop." There was something special in 
his personality, and when I think of early TV, he always comes to mind. I 
remember sitting around the TV with my parents and enjoying his patter so much 
more than the recipes. He was quite a guy. I even remember the show's theme 
song, David Rose's "Our Love."

 Thanks a million, or as we say in Hawaiian, "mahalo mu loa," for the article 
about Jackie Olden and Melinda Lee. Even more important to me was Robin Roy 
Gress' tribute to her dad and my very favorite cook, Mike Roy. I really enjoyed 
remembering those days. Mike taught me loads of goodies I still use.

 Bound to Happen No. 48965: The Benetton family, the clothing makers, also 
co-own a company that puts out united colors of varietal olive oils: one made 
exclusively from Taggiasche olives ("sweet, round, with a delicate nutty 
flavor"), one from a mixture of Moraiolo, Leccino and Frantoio ("fruity, tasty, 
clean, very round, with a pleasantly sharp finish"), the third adding Pendolino 
to that blend ("very fruity, nutty, long finish"). Available "in only the 
finest restaurants and gourmet food stores." (But let's see how many people ask 
for this stuff by name -- the brand name is just e, lower-case and with an 
accent.) This Yak's on You 
</P>

 No kidding (we've seen photos), there really is a restaurant in Lhasa named 
the Hard Yak Cafe. Our informant says the Hard Yak Burger comes by its name 
honestly, and not just because it's made from yak meat. Healthy as Horse

 Speaking of exotic meats, you may find the idea of eating horse meat 
repulsive, but it's pretty safe to eat. Horses are so removed from our food 
cycle that we have very few parasites in common with them. Send, Don't Call

 In last week's item about "Mountain Man Cookbook" we suggested calling author 
Thomas Canino's (800) number. Wrong plan, it turns out. If you want his game

 Wally Amos, the chef's apprentice who became a talent agent and then started 
the Famous Amos cookie company with backing from his show-biz friends, 
eventually had business troubles and sold his company six years ago. Now what 
to do? A non-competition clause kept him from starting another cookie business 
until 1992, and even then he couldn't use his famous old name. His new cookie 
company, which so far does business mostly in Washington and Oregon, is called 
Uncle Noname. CHARLES PERRY

 Many of us believe our craving for some foods is so deep it couldn't just be 
the result of how we were brought up, it's got to be hereditary.Scientists have 
disagreed, and tended to believe tastes are due to culture or upbringing, but 
now there is some evidence of a genetic element. Scientists at the University 
of Cincinnati studied the food preferences of sets of twins and concluded that 
tastes for certain foods seem to be strongly affected by genetics. The foods 
that seems to strike a note in the gene pool include orange juice, chicken, 
cottage cheese and broccoli. BRUCE HENSTELL

 Winemaker Angelo Papagni, who pled guilty two years ago to falsely selling 
Barbera Grapes as Zinfandel and was sentenced to 18 months in federal prison, 
has had his prison term reduced by three months, making him eligible for 
release this week. Los Angeles attorney David Katz appealed to U.S. District 
Court on the grounds that Papagni was sentenced without key facts being told to 
him, and Judge Oliver Wanger agreed to vacate the original sentence and 
re-sentence him last Friday -- under new rules that reduced the sentence to 15 
months. DAN BERGER

DAL; THE ODDER DALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES PERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Other dals you can find in an Indian market include familiar favorites like 
blackeyed peas (cowpeas) and split peas. The blackeyed pea originated in 
Africa, where wild varieties are still found. Oddly, in modern India it's 
called lobia or lobhia , a name that comes from Greek, while rajma , its 
original Indian name, is now applied to kidney beans. Indian cooks boil 
blackeyed peas in the usual way and also grind them into flour for making 
pancakes. 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, split peas, called matar in India, are a different species from 
the garden peas we eat as a fresh vegetable. Technically split peas are Pisum 
arvense, or field peas. They originated in Italy but reached India long ago, at 
least by 1500 B.C. Indian cooks often make field peas into little croquettes 
like felafel. 
</P>
<P>
 The odder dals are ones you might not find even in a well-stocked Indian 
market. You have a middling chance of coming across moth , a native Indian bean 
very similar to moong and cooked much the same. Indian snack shops sell a sort 
of spicy cocktail mix called dal moth , made from fried moth beans and garbanzo 
vermicelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Val or lablab , otherwise known as butter bean, is harder to find in markets, 
but it is sometimes grown in this country as an ornamental plant because of its 
sweetpea-like flowers. Nurseries know it as Dolichos lablab or hyacinth bean. 
The beans take a long time to cook and are difficult to digest, but they're 
popular among Indian vegetarians because their flavor and texture are 
considered to resemble meat. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 K ulathi , otherwise known as horse gram or Madras gram, is a small, 
reddish-brown bean related to val which is eaten fresh or dried; it looks like 
a flattened pea. (In an Indian context the word gram means a pea or bean -- 
urad dal is also called black gram, moong dal is green gram. It's not a native 
Indian term but the Portuguese word grao , meaning grain, which somehow 
acquired this meaning in the early days of the East India trade.) 
</P>
<P>
 Rice bean, known as sutari , meth or (in Nepal) shiltong , is a cousin of 
moong . It's an unprepossessing little thing, but it may turn out to be of some 
importance some day because it has the highest calcium content of any bean. 
</P>
<P>
 Bara sem , otherwise known as nishpava or bhatabans , is an Asian cousin of 
the jackbean, a moderately obscure native of the New World tropics. It's 
sometimes called swordbean because of the shape of its large pods. You won't 
see it in a market in this country -- it's only eaten as a green vegetable. 
That's because ripe swordbeans are, well, just the tiniest bit poisonous.

DAL; COOK WITH A VIEW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty-three years ago, on Roxbury Drive in Beverly Hills, a dinner took place 
that turned out to be a milestone in film and culinary history. 
</P>
<P>
 That evening, a young student from India fixed food for a Hollywood star and 
her friends. The star was Agnes Moorehead. The student was Ismail Merchant. And 
the dinner -- the first he had cooked for anyone in Los Angeles -- was a raging 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchant went on to become a renowned cook. He has also done all right as a 
film producer. In partnership with director James Ivory, Merchant is 
responsible for a string of highly acclaimed films including the recent 
"Remains of the Day," "Howard's End" and "Room With a View." These three films 
garnered a total of 23 Academy Award nominations, winning six Oscars. 
</P>
<P>
 At Moorehead's home, Merchant showed his first film, a short work called "The 
Creation of Woman," which he made in New York in 1960. He also introduced what 
is possibly his most famous dish: lemon lentils. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "People have written about it, they talk about it, and friends travel halfway 
across the world to eat it," writes Merchant in his latest cookbook: "Ismail 
Merchant's Passionate Meals" (Hyperion: $27.50). For Moorehead's dinner, 
Merchant served the dal , chicken cooked with tomatoes and ginger, saffron rice 
and cucumber raita . 
</P>
<P>
 In France, on location this spring for "Jefferson in Paris," Merchant cooked 
lemon lentils for an appreciative cast. A chameleon-like cook, he adjusts his 
recipes to his locations. In Paris, the cast also ate yogurt chicken seasoned 
with green peppercorns; saffron rice, haricots verts and home-grown rhubarb. 
</P>
<P>
 In Florence, during the making of "Room With a View," Merchant served orange 
lentils with pasta and bread seasoned with olive oil and garlic. The Italian 
crew members loved it, he said on the phone from his Paris apartment. "They 
couldn't believe that dal could be so delicious." 
</P>
<P>
 To say that Merchant is a dal enthusiast is an understatement. "I can't live 
without dal ," he writes in "Passionate Meals." "I can do without everything 
else, including meat, fish, vegetables, rice and bread -- but I am a dal 
junkie, and I must have dal ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Merchant even worked dal into the recently released "In Custody," which he 
directed. The wife of a leading character in that film, set in Bhopal, India, 
squats in a courtyard, stirring a pot of her husband's favorite lentils. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every household in India has its own version of dal ," Merchant says. "It is 
a rich man's food, a middle class man's food and a poor man's food. There are 
no barriers when it comes to dal ." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchant includes more than 20 dal recipes in "Passionate Meals," which was 
published in May at the same time as "Ismail Merchant's Florence" (Harry N. 
Abrams: $39.95). The latter book combines Merchant's dining adventures into the 
story of filming "Room With a View." Of the 70 recipes, some are straight 
Italian; some are Italian with a touch of India (eggplant Parmesan with fresh 
red chiles), and some are Indian with a touch of Italy (egg curry with basil). 
</P>
<P>
 An improvisational and nimble cook, Merchant is known for ransacking friends' 
refrigerators and, in a matter of moments, turning whatever he finds into an 
elaborate meal. A few years ago, he came to The Times Test Kitchen and proved 
he could, indeed, produce a full-scale meal in an astonishingly short time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Merchant now has plans to produce food-travel books -- like the handsomely 
illustrated volume on Florence -- for each city where he has filmed and cooked. 
Los Angeles was the location for 1975's "Wild Party" with Raquel Welch, but it 
is "quite far down" the list although, Merchant says, it's "a great place to 
get ingredients." ISMAIL MERCHANT'S LEMON LENTILS (Nimbu Masoor Dal)

IN THE KITCHEN; UP FROM PESTO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS PARSONS, TIMES FOOD MANAGING EDITOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 Am I the only one who's sick of pesto? 
</P>
<P>
 The question seems almost heretical at this time of year, especially from 
someone who's got a full complement of basil plants growing in their side 
garden. 
</P>
<P>
 The other day, while weeding them, it occurred to me that it has been a couple 
of years since I last made pesto. I tear up basil leaves for salads. I use it 
as an accent for soups and stews. I strew it promiscuously over slices of raw 
tomatoes. But it's been a while since I made pesto, which is weird, since 
that's why I started growing basil in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
 Pesto and I had quite a run. For years, making the first batch of pesto was a 
rite of summer, like picking the first tomato. I'd nurse the plants along until 
there were enough leaves to work with without killing them. Then I'd pick the 
leaves and whir them in the food processor with pine nuts or walnuts, cheese 
and garlic until it was all smoothly chopped. Then the oil would go in -- a 
dribble at first, then a stream -- and the paste would make that lovely 
shushing sound as it homogenized into one fragrant, luxurious sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pesto also provided a ceremonious end to summer, as I pulled everything in 
from the garden and made massive amounts of the stuff to freeze. I remember one 
year the basil plants went absolutely nuts and it took almost a full weekend to 
wash, pick over, and puree the leaves. After several runs to the grocery store 
for more cheese, more pine nuts and more olive oil, I had a freezer packed with 
sealable plastic food bags full of green paste. It took a couple of years to go 
through it all and, if I remember correctly, I ended up giving a good chunk of 
it away when we moved. 
</P>
<P>
 Most perfectly, I remember pesto served on gnocchi at a restaurant in what can 
only be described as "pesto country" -- Italy's Ligurian coast. After a day 
spent walking the narrow steets, admiring the olive trees draped with netting 
to catch any stray fruit, it was perfect -- especially when served just before 
a simple grilled branzino.  
</P>
<P>
 But now you can find packaged pesto in almost every dairy case. None of them, 
of course, are much good. In fact, few of them really resemble pesto. The 
problem is that true pesto begins to turn from forest green to olive drab 
within minutes of being made. To avoid that, and to meet federal packaging 
guidelines, commercial pestos are laced with potassium sorbate, or some other 
acidic ingredient that will retard spoilage. I defy you to find that, or any 
other acidic ingredient, in a traditional pesto recipe. 
</P>
<P>
 But, hey, nit-picking about packaged products? That's a little too easy. No, 
my problem with pesto is that it is simply overdone. There are many wonderful 
herb sauces in the wide world of cooking, but none of them has much of a chance 
when all anyone wants is pesto. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Take a simple, honest, hard-working herb like parsley, for example. Sure, it's 
got a bit of a bad image -- anything that has been plunked on that many lunch 
counter plates and sprinkled that liberally over bad stews has got more 
self-revision to do than Ollie North. 
</P>
<P>
 This salsa verde, another Italian herb sauce with an equally long history, is 
a good place to start. It looks a lot like pesto at first glance, but the 
flavor is much more complex, spiked with anchovies and capers and a good hit of 
vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a couple of tricks: First, make it with the flat-leaf, "Italian" 
parsley, which has a deeper, more interesting flavor than the curly parsley 
with which you're probably more familiar. Second, don't be too careful about 
separating the leaves from the stems. While too many stems will result in a 
gritty texture, I think they have more flavor than the leaves. If you'll simply 
chop a chunk from a bunch of parsley, you'll get about the right proportion. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, this sauce is served in the dead of winter with the Piedmontese 
classic bollito misto , a kind of hodgepodge of boiled meats ranging from beef 
ribs and sausages to organ esoterica. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But salsa verde works just as well in the heat of summer with grilled fish. I 
tried it with both swordfish and sea bass and preferred the meatiness of the 
swordfish, though the sea bass disappeared just as quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Just don't call it parsley pesto. GRILLED SWORDFISH WITH SALSA VERDE 
</P>
<P>
 1 clove garlic, minced 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Freshly ground pepper 
</P>
<P>
 4 (1/2-pound) swordfish steaks, about 1 inch thick 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons olive oil 
</P>
<P>
 Juice 1/2 lemon 
</P>
<P>
 Salsa Verde 
</P>
<P>
 Sprinkle garlic and salt and pepper to taste over both sides of swordfish 
steaks. Place steaks in plastic food bag and add olive oil and lemon. Press out 
as much air as possible and seal tightly. Massage seasonings into steaks 
through plastic food bag and marinate in refrigerator at least 1 hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove steaks from plastic food bag, reserving any leftover marinade in bag, 
and grill steaks over medium heat until well-marked on one side, about 7 
minutes. Brush with reserved marinade and carefully turn. Cook another 5 
minutes until point of small sharp knife inserts easily into flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Remove fish to platter and smear each with about 1 tablespoon Salsa Verde. 
Serve remaining sauce on side. Makes 4 to 6 servings. 
</P>

 Each of 4 servings contains about:

</P>
<P>
 4 anchovy fillets 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons capers 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups Italian parsley 
</P>
<P>
 Dash salt 
</P>
<P>
 In small bowl combine bread, olive oil and vinegar. Stir to coat well and set 
aside at least 5 minutes to soften bread. 
</P>
<P>
 In workbowl of food processor fitted with metal blade, combine bread, oil, 
vinegar, anchovies, capers and parsley. Process until fairly smooth. Season to 
taste with salt. Makes about 1 cup.

 Remember the tuna noodle casserole? The one with the crushed potato chips on 
the top? Our new version of this recipe has only three grams of fat compared to 
21 grams in the original recipe and less then half the calories. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce the fat, we used fat-free potato chips, nonfat milk and dry milk 
powder for the white sauce base. We also substituted water-pack tuna instead of 
oil-pack, which allowed us to use the large can of tuna for more tuna flavor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, the potato chips. Using the fat-free potato chips saved 3 
grams of fat per serving. LOW-FAT '50S TUNA NOODLE CASSEROLE

 1/4 cup minced onion 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup sliced celery 
</P>

<P>
 1/4 pound mushrooms, finely chopped 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups nonfat milk 
</P>
<P>
 2 tablespoons nonfat dry milk 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup frozen peas 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 White pepper 
</P>
<P>
 1/4 pound medium noodles cooked according to package directions and drained 
</P>
<P>
 1 (12-1/2 ounce) can tuna packed in water, drained 
</P>
<P>
 2 cups fat-free potato chips, coarsely crushed 
</P>
<P>
 In skillet saute onion and celery in butter until tender. Add mushrooms and 
saute few minutes, until liquid comes out of mushrooms. Stir in flour. 
Gradually blend in milk then nonfat dry milk. Heat, stirring constantly, to 
boiling. Boil and stir until thickened, about 1 minute. Stir in peas. Season to 
taste with salt and white pepper. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoon 1/3 of drained noodles evenly onto 9-inch baking dish sprayed with 
butter-flavored non-stick cooking spray. Arrange 1/2 drained tuna over noodles. 
Pour 1/3 sauce over tuna spreading to edges. Repeat. Top with remaining noodles 
and sauce. Sprinkle crushed potato chips evenly over top of baking dish. Bake 
at 375 degrees 25 to 30 minutes or until top is lightly browned and casserole 
is hot through. Makes 6 servings.

GOOD COOKING: CAMP CUISINE: WILD IN THE COUNTRY

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the world of fishing camps, there is no take-out food. No carry-out roast 
chicken or pasta salad. No bakeries. All you get is wonderful wilderness, bald 
eagles, stunning sunsets and shimmering lakes. And home cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 Home cooking is alive and well in fishing camps -- the only game in town. And 
it's the way cooking used to be: old fashioned, unsophisticated, good tasting. 
</P>
<P>
 Fried fish, barbecued pork chops, bacon and eggs, wild blueberry hot cakes, 
grilled cheese sandwiches with buttered homemade bread, cream of tomato soup -- 
these are the foods when life is enjoyed in the great outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 Desserts are in a category unto themselves. Forget diets and restraint. Judy 
Ottoson, for 18 years the cook in the Kishkutena fishing camp, has a repertoire 
of great dessert recipes handed down from her mother, who held the job before 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I especially enjoy the chocolate chip crisps, the tart plum (or rhubarb) 
meringue torte and the Kishkutena camp cake, a hit from the '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 These are chocolate chip cookies as they used to be: thin, crisp and somewhat 
delicate.  
</P>
<P>
 CHOCOLATE CHIP CRISPS 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup unsalted butter 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons brown sugar, packed 
</P>
<P>
 6 tablespoons granulated sugar 
</P>
<P>
 1 large egg 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup flour 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon salt 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 teaspoon baking soda 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup semisweet chocolate morsels 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl use mixer to cream butter, brown and granulated sugars, egg and 
vanilla. Add flour, salt and baking soda. Mix until combined. Use wooden spoon 
to stir in chocolate morsels. 
</P>
<P>
 Spoon rounded teaspoon of dough onto lightly greased baking sheet, leaving 2 
inches between cookies. Bake on center oven rack at 350 degrees until golden 
brown, about 8 minutes. Cool completely on cooling rack. Can be kept as long as 
5 days at room temperature in airtight container and up to 3 months in freezer, 
wrapped airtight. Makes 5 dozen 3-inch cookies. 
</P>
<P>
 Each cookie contains about:

 45 calories; 22 mg sodium; 8 mg cholesterol; 2 grams fat; 4 grams 
carbohydrates; 0 protein; 0.01 gram fiber.

 Ottoson was given this recipe by her cousin. Actually a bar cookie, it sports 
rhubarb in the early summer and the same quantity of any tart plum in August 
and September. Both fruits contrast with the sweet meringue and neither 
requires peeling. Once the meringue is baked on the cookie, it must be served 
within a few hours as meringues weep on standing, especially on humid days.  
</P>
<P>
 RHUBARB-MERINGUE TORTE 
</P>
<P>
 1 cup unsalted butter, softened 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar 
</P>
<P>
 Salt 
</P>
<P>
 Flour 
</P>
<P>
 3 large egg yolks 
</P>
<P>
 1/2 cup evaporated milk 
</P>
<P>
 4 large stalks rhubarb, cut into 1/2-inch dice, about 4 cups 
</P>
<P>
 4 large egg whites, room temperature 
</P>
<P>
 1 teaspoon vanilla 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl use mixer to cream butter, 2 tablespoons sugar and dash salt until 
fluffy, about 2 minutes. Add 2 cups flour. Combine well. Spread dough evenly 
over bottom of greased 9x13-inch baking pan. Work by hand through piece of 
plastic wrap to make dough as even as possible. Bake at 350 degrees until firm 
but not well browned, about 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl use mixer to beat egg yolks, 1 cup sugar, 2 tablespoons flour and 
evaporated milk until smooth. Spread over top of warm baked crust. Sprinkle 
diced rhubarb evenly over filling. Bake at 350 degrees until mixture sets, 
about 40 to 45 minutes. Can be set aside several hours at room temperature 
before baking meringue. 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl use mixer to whip egg whites and dash salt until whites hold shape and 
are still glossy but not stiff. Add 1/3 cup sugar by tablespoons with mixer 
running. Mix in vanilla. Spread over cookie base, which can be hot, warm or 
room temperature. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 350 degrees until lightly browned, about 12 minutes. Let cool. To 
serve, use sharp knife to cut into squares. Use metal spatula to transfer to 
serving plates. Makes 8 to 10 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of 8 servings contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 521 calories; 110 mg sodium; 169 mg cholesterol; 27 grams fat; 64 grams 
carbohydrates; 8 grams protein; 0.51 gram fiber. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Normally I'm not one to resort to cake mixes and instant fillings but 
Ottoson's version of a '50s 7-Up cake is moist, nicely textured, slightly 
lemony and tastes absolutely delectable with the pineapple topping. It's even 
better the next day.  
</P>
<P>
 KISHKUTENA CAMP CAKE 
</P>
<P>
 1 (1-pound, 2 1/4-ounce) box yellow cake mix 
</P>
<P>
 1 (3.4-ounce) package instant lemon pudding 
</P>
<P>
 4 large eggs 
</P>
<P>
 3/4 cup oil  
</P>
<P>
 1 1/4 cups lemon-flavored soda such as 7-Up (10 ounces) 
</P>
<P>
 Pineapple Topping 
</P>
<P>
 In bowl use mixer to combine cake mix, lemon pudding, eggs and oil until 
smooth. Mix in lemon-flavored soda. Transfer to greased 13x9-inch baking pan. 
Use rubber spatula to spread batter evenly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bake at 350 degrees until lightly browned and wood pick inserted into center 
comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Let stand 10 minutes on rack before 
frosting. 
</P>
<P>
 Spread Pineapple Topping, either hot or warm, over warm cake. To serve cut 
into squares. Makes 1 (13x9-inch) cake, about 12 servings. 
</P>
<P>
 Each serving contains about: 
</P>
<P>
 467 calories; 393 mg sodium; 56 mg cholesterol; 27 grams fat; 58 grams

 1 cup canned crushed pineapple, drained 
</P>
<P>
 3 tablespoons fresh lemon juice 
</P>
<P>

COUNTER INTELLIGENCE: FISH-HEAD QUARTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN GOLD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of the many, many Asian restaurants on Las Tunas Drive in San Gabriel, at 
least half of which are wonderful, I find myself returning to the Vietnamese 
noodle shop Golden Deli, possibly because a craving for Golden Deli's perfect 
spring rolls comes up a little more often than a longing for seven-course beef 
dinners or Taiwanese three-glass chicken, but also because the French-drip 
coffee is good and the scene is pretty groovy. This isn't an original 
assessment: The number of people waiting to get a table at the noodle shop 
often approaches the number of people inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden Deli, though, has a major flaw -- in the French manner, it is closed 
most of August. Three times at least this summer, I sort of randomly headed 
toward the deli around lunchtime, remembered it was closed and headed for other 
places on the street. Among them were Luong Hai Ky (for Chiu Chow-style won ton 
noodles) and the Bavarian Inn (for schnitzel and beer). But the nicest surprise 
was the Malaysian restaurant Yazmin, a restaurant I'd kind of written off 
because the chef had moved on and the food hadn't been as sharp as it once was. 
At Yazmin, I had one of the nicest meals I've had all year. 
</P>
<P>
 Conventional wisdom has it that good restaurants only get better with time, 
which is possibly true in those areas of France where a chef-patron will stay 
in the same kitchen for 20 years, but hardly so in a volatile city such as Los 
Angeles. Restaurants have their natural cycles here: owners change, restaurants 
overextend themselves, and chefs abandon one place for another, taking with 
them entire kitchen crews. But some restaurants do get better. 
</P>
<P>
 Yazmin had grown since I'd been there last, expanding from one tiny room into 
the travel agency next door, picking up high ceilings and a collection of 
shadow puppets, lengthening its small menu. Service was a little more formal 
too. 
</P>
<P>
 And the food . . . rojak salad, a peanut-sprinkled toss of sliced fruits and 
vegetables in a pungent dressing of shrimp paste and sweet, thick Malaysian 
soy, was astonishing: jicama so crisp you could hear the crunching across the 
room, mango and papaya at the sweet, soft height of late-summer ripeness, 
snapping-fresh cucumber, fried cubes of tofu as new-wave croutons, and a subtle 
undercurrent of raw chile heat. I had eaten rojak just a couple of days earlier 
at a faintly related Old Town Pasadena Malaysian restaurant I had thought I 
liked better than Yazmin, but this salad was in another league. 
</P>
<P>
 There was crunchy-skinned fried chicken with a musky, hot tomato glaze. There 
was fresh coconut water and mango juice to drink. Char kuei teow , a sort of 
fried Malaysian-Chinese analogue to the Cantonese rice noodles chow fun , were 
swell, glutinous and chewy and crisped black at the edges, heavily garlicked, 
sweetened with thick soy, every bit the high-calorie Singapore craving they're 
reputed to be. Yazmin was suddenly worth a journey of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 And aside from a dryish fried fish with chile, a dish of fried okra slimy 
enough to overcome its sauce of ground shrimp, and a dull stir-fried chicken 
with tomato -- each of which, oddly enough, has the word "sambal" somewhere in 
its name -- more or less everything here has been good: five-spice-marinated 
pork wrapped in a tofu skin and deep-fried, the little Malaysian empanadas 
called curry puffs, a dish of "Indian-style" mee goreng that is essentially egg 
noodles fried with homemade ketchup but is pretty delicious with a dab of chile 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Specials have included a steamed cake of yams and pounded rice, topped with a 
curl of burnt onion and a sprinkling of chewy dried shrimp, like what you dream 
is in those little bamboo baskets when you try a new dim sum place; a clay pot 
filled with a beef stew almost like a black, carrot-rich Malaysian pot au feu 
violently flavored with lemon grass, cumin and chile; bean curd sheets and 
fish-cake-stuffed tofu served with braised vegetables in a mild, yellow curry 
instead of the usual bean sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 I even liked the fish head curry, not a colorful name for a dumpling or 
something taken from Malaysian folklore but an actual, large fish head, loaded 
with secret pockets of gelatinous meat, floating in a giant bowl of musky 
coconut curry. If the citizens of San Gabriel can get past the hard, squirmy 
reality of nibbling on a fish head, the dish might become as popular as spring 
rolls, in which case Yazmin could also close in August. Then we'd be back to 
schnitzel.

WINE: THE WISDOM OF AGING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN BERGER, TIMES WINE WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We've all heard that fine red wine is better when it's older. I generally 
agree with that, yet as I personally age, I realize how few older wines 
actually are "better." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead I'm finding that many of these deep, dark red wines are merely 
different -- still oaky, still hard and gritty. These days I prefer leaner, 
more gracefully textured wines; if faced with one of the oaky/tannic wines, I 
prefer to drink them younger than I once did. Or not to drink them at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason so few of today's fine red wines age gracefully is that too 
many (especially California Cabernet Sauvignons) have too much tannin and/or 
oak. A decade after the vintage, most of what remains is oak and astringency. 
Fruit is the first quality to flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Some wine collectors are succumbing to the myth that old (and usually 
decrepit) is preferable to young (and still vibrant of fruit) because they 
believe the "experts" who tell them they should like a certain wine. Since oak 
flavors are now in vogue with some reviewers, we are all being educated to like 
oak instead of fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is my experience that too many people stock wine cellars with red wines 
they haven't tasted, or taste so infrequently they don't realize that many of 
their wines are "over the hill" before their time. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a chance to look at a range of 13-year-old red wines the other day, at 
my son Adam's bar mitzvah party. I opened 15 different 1981 California Cabernet 
Sauvignons in addition to a magnum of 1981 Chateau Figeac, a personal favorite. 
All the wines were from an underrated vintage, both here and in Bordeaux. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't a scientific test -- 50 people attending a party, ranging from wine 
experts to complete novices -- but it told me a lot about what a divergent 
group of people actually like. 
</P>
<P>
 Grading the "test" was actually quite simple: I looked at the wine level in 
each of the bottles after the dinner. Since guests could pour as much of any 
wine as they desired, the bottles with the lowest levels were the best-liked. 
</P>
<P>
 The first bottle emptied was the Chateau Figeac, which was at its peak of 
drinkability, still fruity and flavorful though not dark and heavy. One of the 
top California "winners" was a surprise: Cabernet from Buena Vista, made from 
grapes grown in the cool Carneros region. Also drained dry were bottles from 
Beaulieu Vineyard, Tudal Vineyards, Gainey Vineyard (the "Limited Selection") 
and Villa Mount Eden. 
</P>
<P>
 None of these wines was particularly oaky when released. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 1981 Cabernets that people left substantial amounts of were 
Steltzner Vineyards, Beringer Vineyards "Lemon-Chabot Vineyard," Rutherford 
Hill Winery, Alexander Valley Vineyards and William Hill Winery. Almost all of 
these wines were bigger and deeper when released than the "winners" were. 
</P>
<P>
 The main fault with the also-rans was heavy tannin and still-noticeable oak 
that robbed the wines of their remaining fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 The following week, the Opus One project, a joint venture between the Robert 
Mondavi Winery and Chateau Mouton-Rothschild, unveiled its new 1991 vintage red 
wine. Since 1991 is one of the greatest Cabernet vintages in the history of the 
Napa Valley, I was eager to see how the most expensive wine in the valley ($75) 
fared. 
</P>
<P>
 At a luncheon, the winery poured for guests the 1981 Opus One, an excellent 
contrast to the 1981s of the prior week. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1981 Opus One was magnificent, with superb complexity from bottle age, and 
moderate tannins and oak to match with deep fruit. It was wonderful, and I 
recalled its release 11 years ago fondly: The wine had just enough oak and 
tannin for the long haul. It has aged well. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1991, the first wine to be made at the magnificent, multimillion-dollar 
Opus One facility, is very concentrated, full of cassis and red currant aromas, 
and striking for a cedar or sandalwood note that grew stronger with aeration. 
</P>
<P>
 Is it a great wine? Yes, but. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Although the new Opus One is not aggressively tannic, it is significantly 
oakier than past vintages. 
</P>
<P>
 (The aging of red wine in new charred oak barrels from France is now so 
pervasive that a tour guide for the Robert Mondavi Winery recently was heard to 
tell a group of tourists proudly, "Our NFO program is really working well these 
days." He later apologized, saying NFO was in-house argot for "new French 
oak.") 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Will the 1991 Opus One age as well as did the 1981? I can't say. I'd like to 
review it again in six months or so to see if the oak has begun to integrate 
with the fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the Opus One unveiling, I waded through 32 more 1991 Cabernet 
Sauvignons and found many of the more expensive wines so hard, so gritty with 
tannin and so laden with new oak that I fear for their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the wines that prompted me to write the words tough and hard on my score 
sheet were four Napa Valley red wines: from Martin Ray ($25), Pahlmeyer ($32), 
Merryvale Vineyards ($23) and Far Niente Winery ($40). 
</P>
<P>
 I especially liked the fruit and depth of the latter two, but the tannins are 
so hard in the Merryvale and the new oak is so dominant in the Far Niente that 
I believe that at their prices, the onus is on the back of the buyer. For me, 
cellaring them is a gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, I'm not suggesting you shouldn't like oak and tannin, but if you 
do, drink the wines young, while the fruit still has a fighting chance. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade from now, the best wines will be those wines made with more of an eye 
on the fruit and less on the barrel. Wine of the Week 
</P>
<P>
 1992 Quivira Vineyards "Dry Creek Cuvee" ($12) -- When Henry and Holly Wendt 
bought their 90-acre ranch on the western edge of the Dry Creek Valley in 
Sonoma County in 1980, it included a tiny half-acre vineyard planted decades 
earlier. The vines were a classic "Italian winegrower" field blend of Grenache, 
Carignane, Mataro and Syrah. The fact that most of the grapes originated in 
France's Rhone Valley was of little consequence to the early Italian farmers, 
who felt the vines were perfect for this climate and soil.  
</P>
<P>
 To pay homage to the tradition of the region, the Wendts planted four acres of 
Grenache and smaller amounts of Mataro (more commonly known these days as 
Mourvedre) and Syrah. For this wine, winemaker Grady Wann blended 60%, 19% and 
12% of those three grapes, respectively. The remaining 9% is Quivira's 
marvelous Zinfandel, making this wine a truly traditional Dry Creek blend. 
</P>
<P>
 It shows wonderful scents of raspberry and clove. There is a load of fruit 
flavor, and the finish is absolutely lush and delicious. The wine, which goes 
well with a wide variety of Mediterranean-style foods, is great today and for 
the next five years.  
</P>
<P>
 Will it age a decade? The wine is so tasty, I doubt any will be left by then.

HARVEST FESTIVALS; FULL MOON WITH CAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA HANSEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kien Giang Bakery in Echo Park is in full holiday regalia. Red lanterns dangle 
outside; employees wear cheerful red shirts, and red boxes by the hundreds are 
being packed with luscious mooncakes. 
</P>
<P>
 For a month before the Chinese moon festival each fall, the bakery runs two 
shifts. That's what it takes to produce thousands of sweet cakes, each 
specially shaped and stamped with a design indicating what's inside. Tradition 
is to nibble on the cakes while admiring the brightest and biggest full moon of 
the year. (That moon appears Monday through Wednesday nights next week. The 
official festival date is Tuesday.) 
</P>
<P>
 Bakery owner Henry Wong, a Chinese-Vietnamese, makes cakes to please both 
cultures. Wong is from Kien Giang in South Vietnam. Last year and again this 
past March, he went to Hanoi to research a northern Vietnamese mooncake called 
banh deo . This pale-ivory mooncake is wrapped in glutinous rice flour dough. 
Inside are a choice of mixed nuts, lotus paste or mung beans. Wong adds a dash 
of jasmine flavoring, but in Vietnam the cake would be scented with an essence 
extracted from grapefruit blossoms.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The typical mooncake is golden brown. At Kien Giang, the cakes are coated with 
a pastry composed of cake flour, sugar cooked to a brown syrup and cottonseed 
oil. The cakes are formed by hand. To make lotus paste mooncakes, workers wrap 
a tennis ball-sized hunk of filling with a thin layer of pastry and press it 
with a plunger-like mold. The cakes are baked twice. Before the second baking, 
they're brushed with egg wash to add a shiny finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Mooncakes will keep for a month in an airtight container, Wong says. More 
fragile than other mooncakes, banh deo should be eaten within 10 days. All 
should be stored at room temperature. Refrigeration makes them unpleasantly 
hard. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Wong's specialties is a mooncake made with durian, the Southeast Asian 
fruit known (even notorious) for its powerful aroma. Wong also makes a coconut 
mooncake. The filling combines macaroon coconut, glistening shreds of a 
Philippine coconut variety called macapuno , and coconut milk. 
</P>
<P>
 To Wong's knowledge, he is the only baker who has mastered the taro mooncake. 
The trick is to get the correct consistency without diluting the taro flavor 
with thickeners. Wong steams the taro, then cooks it in a wok with oil and 
sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional Chinese mooncake fillings include mixed nuts, lotus paste, black 
date, mung bean and red bean. Wong even makes shark's fin mooncakes, mixing the 
shredded fins with mixed nuts and bits of Chinese sausage. A box of four 
shark's fin cakes costs $25; it makes a prestigious gift. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest seller is the mixed nut mooncake, Wong says. The filling includes 
cashews, almonds, pumpkin, sesame and watermelon seeds and candied winter 
melon. The nut cake is square while those filled with pastes are round. 
</P>
<P>
 Mooncakes wouldn't be mooncakes without a moon-shaped ingredient: the salted 
yolk of a duck egg. Wong gets these from China and puts from one to three in an 
average-size mooncake. He also makes "moonless" mooncakes, omitting the egg to 
please vegetarians and cholesterol watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Wong opened his bakery in 1980, he sold only 200 boxes of mooncakes a 
season. Now he distributes to markets in Los Angeles and Orange County and 
ships by air as far as Orlando, Fla. -- "wherever Vietnamese and Chinese live," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The bakery is a family operation. Wong's children help out after school. Wife 
Helen shapes large pig-shaped mooncakes by hand. The whimsical design shows a 
sow nursing a row of piglets. Smaller pig cakes are shaped with wooden molds 
hand-carved by Vietnamese. The pigs appeal to youngsters, Wong says. In 
Vietnam, children observe the moon festival by parading with lanterns similar 
to those that Wong has strung in the sales area of the bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Wong has introduced mini-mooncakes, just large enough for a single 
serving. Individually wrapped, the mini-cakes come in boxes of four, two filled 
with lotus paste and two with mixed nuts. That way, moon-watchers can select 
their favorite flavor rather than cutting up and sharing larger cakes. At the 
other extreme, there's a jumbo cake stuffed with six egg yolks and packed one 
to a box. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices range from $8 for a box of four mini-cakes to $16 for the jumbo cake. 
The large pig, available by special order only, is $10; a small pig without egg 
yolk is $2. Mixed nut cakes containing one egg yolk are priced at $14 for a box 
of four, or $3.50 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Kien Giang Bakery is on Echo Park Avenue just off Sunset Boulevard in the 
heart of a Latino shopping district. The bakery maintains a side trade in 
Western cakes for that market, and Wong travels extensively to study baking 
techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 Mooncakes will be available at the bakery until Monday. The largest selection 
of Kien Giang mooncakes outside the bakery is at Viet-Huong, a Chinatown 
restaurant and deli heaped with Vietnamese specialties for takeout. 
</P>

 Next week's full moon inspires not only the Chinese moon festival but Korean 
Chusok, a harvest and thanksgiving celebration that runs Monday through 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Korea, it's customary to honor the harvest with a farmer's dance and 
parade. People return to their home towns, visit grave sites, don their finest 
clothing and make food offerings to ancestors. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the moon festival, Chusok has its own special pastries, called song-pyon. 
Korean bakeries in Los Angeles generally stuff these small, chewy rice cakes 
with sesame seeds and sugar. Sweet bean paste is another typical filling. In 
size, song-pyon are somewhere between a quail egg and a ping-pong ball. 
</P>
<P>
 The cakes come in three colors -- natural white, pale pink and gray-green. The 
pink cakes are tinted with food color. The green hue is extracted from mugwort 
( Artemisia asiatica ), a cousin of sagebrush known as suk in Korea. Bakeries 
here tint the dough with mugwort powder. Authentic song-pyon are steamed 
between layers of pine needles. 
</P>
<P>
 Korean women have long taken pride in their skill in shaping these delicate 
cakes. Today, it's more convenient to buy them. Song-pyon are available in some 
Korean supermarkets, but the best sources are bakeries that specialize in rice 
cakes as they produce fresh song-pyon daily. For festive presentations, 
bakeries will stack dozens of the cakes in burnished octagonal wooden trays. 
</P>
<P>
 Song-pyon are most closely linked to Chusok, but other sweet cakes are popular 
too. Most Koreatown markets and some bakeries sell fried honey cookies called 
yak-kwa , either imported from Korea or made locally. Another popular dessert 
is yaksik, a steamed rice pudding embedded with the dried red date-like fruits 
known as jujubes, pine nuts and chestnuts. Made with glutinous rice, yaksik is 
tinted brown with soy sauce, sesame oil and brown sugar. Bottled caramel sauce 
manufactured in Korea is sometimes added to deepen the color. YAKSIK (Korean 
Rice Pudding)

 SIERRA MADRE: Opponents of a five-person planning commission vowed this week 
to appeal a judge's decision to uphold the city clerk's refusal to count 
signatures on a petition for an election to restore the planning body to seven 
members. Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Robert O'Brien ruled last Thursday 
that City Clerk Nancy Sue Shollenberger was correct to reject the petition 
because it did not conform to the format specified in California's election 
code.

 GIGANTIC YARD SALE?: A red trolley and a gray house may be turning into white 
elephants for the city of Torrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with spending nearly $20,000 to demolish and dispose of two famous 
antiques -- an old Pacific Electric Railway Car and the Weston House -- or 
spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to restore them, the Torrance City 
Council decided Tuesday not to do anything, for now. The council wants to wait 
a few months and see if any private group comes forward to rescue them. 
</P>
<P>
 The city acquired the 84-year-old Pacific Electric Railway Car No. 4601 in 
1987 from a family that had used it as a home and machine shop. Vandalism and 
weathering have severely deteriorated the car's condition, and experts say it 
would cost about $300,000 to fully restore it. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the Red Car, the Weston House has been stored near Wilson Park, where 
vandals and weather have damaged it. City staff members estimate it would cost 
$100,000 to $250,000 to restore the 80-year-old house. The building was once 
located south of what is now the Torrance Airport, and was home to the owner of 
the local rancho.

 BRANDO BASHING: It was 1963. A civil rights group marches through the streets, 
attracting angry onlookers who wave placards bearing racial epithets. Marching 
along with members of the Congress of Racial Equality is actor Marlon Brando, 
followed by jeering young men in white robes and three self-proclaimed American 
Nazis carrying a sign that says, "Brando Is a Stooge for Communist Race 
Mixture." 
</P>
<P>
 But the march was much closer to Hollywood than to the Deep South: It was at 
the Southwood Riviera Royale tract in Torrance, where CORE was protesting 
discriminatory housing sales practices. Brando featured a photo of the march in 
his newly released autobiography, "Songs My Mother Taught Me."

 DRIP, DRIP, DRIP: They may need a plumber in Redondo Beach. City Hall seems to

<P>
 A confidential report regarding the work practices of Treasurer Alice E. 
DeLong has apparently been leaked to the press. Thing is, no one is willing to 
fess up to being the leaker. 
</P>
<P>
 City Hall sources say only nine people have direct access to the report. They 
include the mayor; the five council members; the city attorney; Linda Jenson, 
an outside attorney working with the city, and Nancy Leonard, an Orange 
County-based personnel consultant who wrote the report. The sources say the 
report contains interviews with employees in DeLong's office, who say they are 
subject to verbal thrashings from DeLong, and calls hiring practices into 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 But when asked who released the report to the Daily Breeze in Torrance, city 
officials note that the mayor and council have publicly denied leaking the 
report. City attorney Jerry Goddard also denies leaking the report, as does 
Jenson. QUOTE OF THE WEEK

CITY HALL NEWS: PASADENA; CITY PAYS $19,366 TO SETTLE WITH FESTIVAL VENDORS; 
WORLD CUP: MERCHANTS LOST MONEY AFTER BEING BANNED FROM THE ROSE BOWL AREA ON 
GAME DAYS. SETTLEMENTS INCLUDE CASH AND THE RIGHT TO SELL AT FUTURE STADIUM 
EVENTS. 
</P>

<P>
 The city of Pasadena has paid out a total of $19,366 to settle with 10 vendors 
who complained they lost thousands of dollars after renting booth space at the 
failed Soccer Carnaval, a monthlong festival that coincided with the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The vendors were also given the right to sell at various events at the city's 
Rose Bowl in the next year for free, including UCLA football games, the swap 
meet and the upcoming Eagles and Rolling Stones concerts, according to 
settlement documents. 
</P>
<P>
 The city planned the carnival after World Cup organizers placed their official 
celebration, Soccerfest, in Los Angeles during the Cup games in June and July. 
But the World Cup intervened, using the clout in its contract with Pasadena to 
keep Soccer Carnaval from opening on game days, when the big crowds came to the 
city. Attendance was so sparse that the carnival-ride operator packed up and 
left for good on the second day. 
</P>
<P>
 Three vendors received the largest payouts of $3,000 each. One vendor, Wood 
Fired Pizza, received the $3,000 plus rights to sell at three UCLA football 
games and a concert, agreements reveal. Wood Fired Pizza claims to have lost 
more than $15,000. Vendors paid up to $7,000 to participate in the festival, 
and most lost more than that in labor and unwanted stock. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they paid out an additional $20,000 for extra advertising 
in the middle of the event after it became apparent it was not drawing crowds. 
A full accounting of the loss on the festival that was originally meant to 
raise $650,000 for the city has yet to be completed.  
</P>
<P>
 A dozen vendors have not settled with the city. City officials said no 
negotiations are taking place and claims against the city, a precursor to a 
lawsuit, have not been filed. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials refused to say whether the city's partner in the festival, 
Pasadena Productions Inc., contributed toward the settlements. However, those 
close to the negotiations said the promotions company paid nothing. Its owners 
claim to have lost $50,000 on the event.

LIFE & TIMES / WENDY MILLER: GRAND OPENING RAISES GRAND HOPES FOR ARTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WENDY MILLER, Wendy Miller is editor of Ventura County Life. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some grand openings are just grander than others; with institutions, as with 
nature, there is a hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 At the low end of the ribbon-cutting chain is the fast-food outlet or the auto 
parts store, both of which celebrate the beginning of commercial life with 
helium-filled balloons and a clown past its prime. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher up on the chain are openings of restaurants, mini-malls and car lots, 
where the balloons are bigger, brighter and have subtler type. There are also 
special discounts, 25-cent rides, raffles and freebies, including food. And the 
clowns are usually fresh out of clown school. 
</P>
<P>
 Then comes the great-grand-daddy of retail events: the mall opening, where you 
get all the things mentioned above, and the local radio station comes out to 
boot. 
</P>
<P>
 But for grandeur and civic pride, there is nothing like the inauguration of a 
major institution. And some institutions are so significant to a community that 
all the pomp and ceremony can't fit into a single opening night. Such is case 
with the Thousand Oaks Civic Arts Plaza, where a full season of programming 
gets under way Friday night, with the Santa Susana Repertory production of "Man 
of La Mancha." 
</P>
<P>
 The musical will signal the official opening of the Forum Theatre, the smaller 
of the two venues that makes up the Civic Arts Plaza. The grand opening of the 
plaza's larger Civic Auditorium will be Oct. 22, and will include gala 
festivities, the nationally renowned Bernadette Peters and the locally 
recognized Conejo Symphony Orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 This provides the Civic Arts Plaza with two opportunities to make the county's 
residents aware of a new regional force on the arts horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of a concert house that serves this area intrigues me and carries 
with it the hope that somehow it will reflect this area," said Len Reed, who 
wrote this week's Centerpiece story on the Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big-ticket entertainment is getting to be the same everywhere: Tony Bennett 
is Tony Bennett in Cleveland or Thousand Oaks," said Reed. "And that's the real 
truth about our performing arts center -- the main hall can't pay for itself 
without crowd-pleasers who are national in name and appealing to a mass 
audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Reed said once the arts plaza achieves financial stability, he hopes the 
facility's programmers will reach beyond the tried and true. 
</P>
<P>
 "My greatest hope is that a year or so from now, the Civic Arts Plaza might 
reach for some edge, some special energy, some alternative programs that give 
it a soul and heart as distinctive as its stunning and original building. That 
means alternative rock for the kids, performance art and jazz and contemporary 
off-Broadway plays for everyone else. Yes, they'll be risky. But then that's 
how you keep the word art in the name Civic Arts Plaza," said Reed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise we've simply gone to huge expense to dress the Vegas showroom in 
suburban tweeds. That would be a pity."

SIGHTS; EXHIBIT PUTS SPOTLIGHT ON NEON ART AT OJAI GALLERY; SHOW GIVES MEDIUM A 
CHANCE TO SHINE IN ALL ITS RAINBOW COLORS AND PRESENTS WORKS THAT RANGE FROM 
MEDITATIVE TO PLAYFUL AND GARISH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By day, the gallery appears to be mysteriously cloaked in darkness, with 
shades keeping sunlight out. By night, bolts and tubes of glaring color turn 
the space into a garden of unearthly spectra. 
</P>
<P>
 It can mean only one thing: Neon art has come to Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 Artists using neon, either as a primary material or in conjunction with other 
media, have their work cut out for them. The medium itself is a difficult one 
to tame, involving logistics of electricity and technology. Modes of expression 
tend to be limited to linear designs and unmodulated fields of loud color. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the question of acceptance in an art world that hasn't yet fully 
grown to appreciate the fine art potential of this fluorescent palette. To 
many, neon is a symbol of kitsch (whose mecca is Las Vegas), of commercial 
signage and of visual noise. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, despite such venues as the Museum of Neon Art on the 
Universal CityWalk and the opening up of attitudes toward what's viable in art, 
neon remains an outsider. 
</P>
<P>
 And outsiders attract, which is the subplot of the current Neon Art show at 
the G. Childress Gallery, extended through this weekend. Curated by Jan 
Sanchez, a neon-wielding multimedia artist living in Ojai, this show involves 
art from the ranks of the Coalition of Light Artists. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the gallery, the visitor is not struck by a strong cohesive sense of 
artistic purpose but by the vivid, weird, gaseous and, in a way, gaudy light. 
</P>
<P>
 What binds these artists is not so much an aesthetic mindset as an attraction 
to a specific, unorthodox medium. Attitudes vary. Some of the more playful art 
here cozies right up to neon's rep for garishness. Other art steers clear of 
such an extroverted nature, going for a more meditative effect. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little empathetic thread, for instance, between the boisterous 
animal-based pieces of Michael Flechtner -- which tend to scream for attention 
-- and the subtle, landscape-oriented abstractions of Kunio Oshashi. 
</P>
<P>
 Oshashi's works may be the most compelling of the show for their inventive 
redefinition and artful reworking of neon's properties. In a work such as the 
Japanese garden-like "Rock and Tree Where I Want to Be," Oshashi creates a 
sensitive blend of elements, finding a natural interaction between technology 
and poetic suggestion. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Untitled 2," a sloping, bright-red ground plays host to a spindly, 
leafless bonsai tree, a bulbous blue form and contrapuntal lines raked across 
the "ground." Such tranquil, non-representational use of neon is refreshing to 
see. 
</P>
<P>
 Flechtner's art, on the other hand, appears more the work of a proudly vulgar 
American. Obviously highly skilled in the use of neon, Flechtner capitalizes on 
the commercial life of the medium, and his artworks seem to double as 
advertisements for their own cleverness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hovercat" finds a cat hovering over a food bowl, in an apparent state of 
alarm or disquiet. The background shifts from red to blue, implying fickle 
feline temperament. A cat, lusting after a hot dog, is again the protagonist in 
"Hot Dog." Here, the artist incorporates classical composition, Japanese and 
Greek symbols, Christian references and a poignant story about his late trucker 
father -- nicknamed "hot dog" -- to create a high fallutin' fast-food allegory. 
</P>
<P>
 Flechtner is the mild-mannered prankster, eager to forsake art world sobriety 
and leave 'em laughing. How else can we account for "Dinosaur Head," a 
motion-sensitive kinetic piece that opens its gaping jaw every time you walk 
by? 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, whose works often seem like dream world stage sets, works a middle 
ground in which neon is not the sole focus of art, but just a complementary 
presence. "Summer Madness" is a multimedia tableau, a summer-night scene in a 
garden of gravel and steel, along with writhing neon tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in Glass Houses" sits, in all its weird glory, in the middle of the 
gallery. A simple form of a house, its exterior is covered in frosted 
plexiglass and framed in neon, with enigmatic bursts of blinking colored lights 
inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Vocationally, Korey Kline is an engineer who works in research and 
development, specializing in pyrotechnics, explosives and rocket propellants. 
Science, clearly, is a motivating force in his artwork, as well. "Gravity's 
Angel" is a "plasma sculpture" in which kinetic activity that suggests biology 
is viewed through three glass blocks, stacked like TV monitors and suggesting a 
human body. You get a sense of blood flowing in designated shapes, as if you're 
viewing microscopic energy rendered as a dance of bodily fluid. 
</P>
<P>
 A kind of surreal 3-D still-life sensibility emanates from Kim Koga's "Jelly 
Bean Harvest," with its shiny ceramic "beans" out of which rise vivid red-neon 
tendrils. Koga's "Ancestors," with its melding of neon and nostalgic color 
Xerox, echoes David Svenson's "Ghosts of Courageous Ancestors," in which a 
photomural, wood, and glass-relief sculpture pay homage to Native American 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 Another introspective, essentially abstract artist here is Tessie Dong. Like 
Oshashi, Dong blends neon with such seemingly antithetical materials as rusty 
metal, mirror shards and fabric, contrasted with the techno-gleam of neon. Her 
sumptuous, sweeping compositions make for striking studies in juxtaposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaving this show -- one of the more intriguing exhibits in the county of late 
-- you tend to be sensitized to the visual stimuli in the everyday. "Foxy Lady 
Hair Styling," reads a fanciful neon sign in Meiners Oaks. Previously ignored 
"OPEN" signs leap out for attention, signposts of business readiness. 
</P>
<P>
 On that count, neon art validates one important side effect of art by 
promoting a heightened awareness of the world outside the protected confines of 
the art world. Details

WATERS VOICES CONCERNS ABOUT ALLEGED BIAS OF HAWTHORNE POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON GARCIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Maxine Waters has asked the federal Justice Department to make sure the 
Hawthorne Police Department is not discriminating against black officers and 
applicants before federal money is released for a community policing program.  
</P>
<P>
 In a letter to U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno, Waters (D-Compton) raised concerns 
about the department's hiring practices and racial makeup. The force has only 
three African Americans among 90 sworn officers, or about 3%, city officials 
say. By contrast, the city's population is 28% African American, according to 
1990 Census figures. The department also has not adopted an affirmative action 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have three . . . and no affirmative action plan, that appears to be 
a problem," said Patrick Lacefield, spokesman for Waters.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, a black applicant who was turned down and an officer on the 
Hawthorne force filed separate discrimination complaints this year against the 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters brought the situation to the Justice Department's attention because the 
complaints and local news reports about them created "anxiety in the 
community," the letter said. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Hawthorne was given preliminary approval for a $553,000 federal grant 
to hire six new officers. But before the money is released, U.S. Department of 
Justice officials said, police departments must answer a series of questions, 
including whether any charges of discrimination have been settled or are 
pending and whether an affirmative action program is in place.  
</P>
<P>
 A grant cannot be awarded to a department if systematic discrimination is 
found, and if a department violates requirements after the grant has been 
given, the money could be withdrawn, justice officials said. However, they 
said, they try to fix the discrimination problem before they withdraw a grant. 
</P>
<P>
 "The goal is to bring (departments) into compliance, not to penalize the 
community," said Harri J. Kramer, director of justice programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the cases pending against the department, a former Gardena police 
officer complained to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission that he was 
denied a job in Hawthorne because he is black. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorian Burton, who is now with the Inglewood Police Department, said he was 
taken off Hawthorne's hiring list even though he finished sixth out of 166 
applicants on standardized tests and oral exams during the last hiring cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials said incidents uncovered in a routine background check 
disqualified Burton, but they declined to elaborate. Burton said those 
incidents included alleged charges of sexual harassment.  
</P>
<P>
 In the other case, Roosevelt Matthews, a 13-year veteran of the Hawthorne 
department, filed a complaint with the state Department of Fair Employment and 
Housing, claiming he was harassed by a white supervisor. When he complained, he 
said, critical letters from his supervisors were placed in his personnel file. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials would not comment on the specifics of the complaint but said 
they have responded to the charges and are confident they will prevail in both 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, in 1987 then-Sgt. Don Jackson charged that officers used racial 
slurs when describing minorities. The city settled the case out of court, and 
Jackson has since left the force.  
</P>
<P>
 The Jackson suit spurred city officials to draft an affirmative action plan, 
but that plan was never presented to the council. The city manager in charge of 
the project is no longer working for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit also led to sensitivity training for all officers, Chief Stephen R. 
Port said, and derogatory language is not tolerated.  
</P>
<P>
 Hawthorne personnel director Douglas K. Gates said those three complaints are 
the only ones the department has had in 13 years.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think they will find we do a good job. We try to recruit from all different 
minorities," Port said.  
</P>
<P>
 But critics say the small number of African Americans on the force points to a 
discriminatory pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "The disparity in the numbers," coupled with the pending complaints, shows 
discrimination, said Lionel Broussard, a key player in racial discrimination 
suits filed against Centinela Valley Union High School District last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Justice Department found "a racially hostile environment" at the district, 
which includes Hawthorne schools. The district later paid more than $500,000 to 
black administrators.  
</P>
<P>
 City officials say that they are trying to hire more minorities but that there 
is no connection between low numbers of African Americans on the force and 
racial discrimination.  
</P>
<P>
 Officials are updating the affirmative action plan with new census data and 
will send it to the City Council in the coming months, Gates said. The force 
now includes three African Americans, five Asians, 10 Latinos and 72 whites. Of 
eight recently hired officers who are still on probation, four are minorities, 
including two African Americans, an Asian and a Latino.

ELECTIONS; GOP TO AID BROOKS' RACE FOR HOUSE; DOLE, GINGRICH, KEMP WILL 
CAMPAIGN FOR RANCHO PALOS VERDES CHALLENGER. DEMOCRATIC INCUMBENT HARMAN 
DOWNPLAYS THE IMPACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TED JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Palos Verdes Councilwoman Susan Brooks has insisted all year that the 
national Republican Party would come to her aid in her race against Rep. Jane 
Harman (D-Rolling Hills). 
</P>
<P>
 This Saturday, she will have her proof: Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole 
(R-Kan.) plans to campaign for her at a fund-raiser in Manhattan Beach. And 
House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) and Jack Kemp, former secretary of 
Housing and Urban Development, are scheduled to stump for her in October. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks' campaign says the parade of Republican stalwarts shows that national 
party officials have clearly targeted Harman for defeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The national Republican Party is taking this race very seriously," said John 
Perkins, Brooks' campaign manager. "We're on their top five list (of targeted 
races) in the state. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the National Republican Congressional Committee confirmed that 
the group views the 36th Congressional District contest as one of the most 
competitive of 52 House races in California. But the spokesman, Dan Leonard, 
added that committee officials won't decide until the end of September how much 
time and money to invest in Brooks' campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, meanwhile, contend that national Republicans are exaggerating their 
interest in the race and in the end will invest their energies in other 
districts across the country. Brooks -- who is campaigning for her first 
elective office beyond the Palos Verdes Peninsula -- is merely a "sacrificial 
candidate," said Bob Mulholland, campaign adviser for the state Democratic 
Party. 
</P>
<P>
 The national GOP "will pretend they are (targeting the race), and the 
Republican candidate's campaign will think they are, but in the last week the 
candidate's campaign won't get their phone calls returned," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman has had a much larger campaign fund than Brooks. At the end of June, 
she had a little more than $400,000. Brooks had $2,600 when she emerged from a 
bruising primary battle with former Palos Verdes Estates Councilman Ron 
Florance. She has raised about $50,000 since then, Perkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each party's national political committees can contribute $5,000 in cash to a 
candidate. The parties can provide other campaign help for a candidate, but 
joint expenses such as campaign mailers and advertisements cannot exceed 
$29,300 in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, candidates often depend on national personalities to boost their 
stature and raise individual contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Republicans also predict that Brooks should benefit if Republican Gov. 
Pete Wilson does well in the South Bay in his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Pete Wilson can carry the district by a significant margin, as long as a 
Republican (like Brooks) runs a decent campaign, I think the Republican can 
win," said Republican consultant Allan Hoffenblum, who worked for Florance in 
the primary. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, he said, Harman cannot depend on any Democratic coattails to help 
her race. Many freshman Democratic House members have tried to distance 
themselves from President Clinton, whose popularity has declined in much of the 
nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Harman "ran an independent campaign two years ago, and she will run an 
independent campaign again this year," said her campaign spokesman, Roy Behr. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks has attacked Harman for backing most of Clinton's legislative 
proposals, especially his budget plan that narrowly passed in the House last 
year. Republicans say that the plan has ended up raising taxes for the middle 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are the kinds of things voters in the district will look at," Perkins 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brooks "has an advantage in that she can bring in the Republican 
heavyweights," Hoffenblum said. "Jane Harman has her hands tied. She is 
representing a political party whose President a majority disapprove of. She 
has to wage a maverick campaign, independent of the Democratic Party." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman might be doing just that. For instance, Harman is hosting a fund-raiser 
Friday in Marina del Rey that will include eight other congresswomen elected in 
1992 but no members of the Clinton Administration.

SUPERVISORS SUPPORT PLAN TO DREDGE MARINA ENTRANCE; ENVIRONMENT: PROPOSAL BY 
ARMY CORPS OF ENGINEERS WOULD REMOVE TOXIC SEDIMENT FROM CHANNEL AND BURY WASTE 
AT L.A. HARBOR SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Army Corps of Engineers proposal to dump tons of contaminated sediment from 
Marina del Rey at a site in the Port of Los Angeles has received the unanimous 
backing of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent Monday to the California Coastal Commission, board Chairwoman 
Yvonne Braithwaite Burke urged the agency to allow the corps to remove about 
135,000 cubic yards of silt and sand tainted with lead and dozens of toxic 
substances from the Ballona Creek's runoff to deepen the marina's entrance 
channel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coastal Commission was scheduled to vote on the proposal at a hearing 
today in Eureka, but Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan and Councilman Rudy 
Svorinich Jr. have asked the commission for a delay so it can conduct the vote 
in the harbor area to make it easier for residents to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter Tuesday, the supervisors agreed to allow the county to 
indemnify the Port of Los Angeles for any problems caused by the transfer and 
deposit of the material. The county, in turn, would be indemnified by the 
corps, a federal agency, pending congressional approval, which could take up to 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Port officials had expressed concern about dumping the sediment at the harbor 
site because of its potential interruption of a massive $150-million expansion 
project that began Sept. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have said the buildup of silt at the marina's entrance, which is 
caused by the flow from Ballona Creek, has become a hazard for boats. In 
addition to the 6,000 pleasure craft that ply the area, officials are concerned 
about the operations of the U.S. Coast Guard cutter Point Bridge, which would 
be used for rescues if a plane crashes at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 50% of both the north and south entrances have been closed to boating, 
and in some places off the jetty, depending on the tides, the water is three 
feet deep or less," said Jim Fawcett, the chief of planning for the County 
Department of Beaches and Harbors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, officials say, shoals have increased in the remaining boating 
lanes, and there is concern that severe winter storms, which increase the 
creek's sediment flow, could impede harbor navigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1960s, the corps has dredged the sediment in the marina, but now 
faces more stringent federal disposal rules. In 1990, the Environmental 
Protection Agency rejected a corps request to dump some of the buildup in the 
ocean six miles off the Palos Verdes Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, at the urging of county officials, the Coastal Commission 
reluctantly agreed to a "knockdown," a flattening of the bottom of the marina 
channel, as temporary relief. The project was granted with the understanding 
that the corps would come up with a long-term solution. 
</P>
<P>
 With the shoals again high, the corps is asking for another stopgap measure. 
The federal agency wants to remove the marina's poisonous buildup, pack it in 
special plastic tubes and bury it in a shallow 185-acre wildlife area at the 
San Pedro harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 But some environmentalists, including the Heal the Bay group, vehemently 
oppose the marina dredging plan.

A TEMPEST OVER TREES; FRUSTRATED HOME SELLERS CUT BACK OAK TO AVOID BAD LUCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD WINTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Peter Kao and his wife loved the massive 100-year-old oak tree that stood on 
their Sierra Madre lawn in front of their main door. They even planted some 
more trees on the city's parkway, the green strip along the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 But last week, after two years of unsuccessfully trying to sell the regal 
hillside home, they decided to cut back the three-story oak to a few branches 
and removed four trees on the parkway, incurring the wrath of neighbors and the 
city's tree preservation commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 From the Kaos' perspective, it was a matter of financial prudence, born of the 
need to attract Chinese buyers who respect a centuries-old Chinese mystical 
craft called feng shui . Among other things, feng shui holds that the presence 
of a tree or post in front of a door blocks the cosmic forces of good luck and 
wealth from flowing into a home. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are tree lovers but you can't ignore a 5,000-year-old Chinese tradition 
in the San Gabriel Valley," said David Lee of Baldwin Realtors, who is managing 
the sale of the property in 300 block of Grove Street. "Ninety percent of 
buyers in the west San Gabriel Valley are Chinese for (higher-priced) homes 
like this one." 
</P>
<P>
 After failing to attract buyers with a price cut from $449,000 to $399,000, 
the Kaos decided it was necessary to prune the oak drastically to let the 
spirits through, said Lee, speaking on behalf of the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Sierra Madre officials said they respect the ancient belief, but that tree 
preservation is another matter. The property owners violated city law by 
cutting down the parkway trees on public property. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is legal to cut trees on private property, cutting back the oak 
has caused resentment among neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, if I went to China, I'd respect the customs there. If I come into a 
small neighborhood and trees are very important, I don't cut down the trees," 
said Lew Watanabe, chairman of the city's Tree Preservation Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Watanabe said the property owners will have to put at least two trees back in 
the parkway; he has offered to help get another substantial tree for the lawn 
area that can be placed out of the door's way. 
</P>
<P>
 But if more homeowners decide to cut down trees for any reason without 
consulting neighbors or the city, he said, Sierra Madre may be forced to enact 
an ordinance affecting private property as well. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say that in recent months they have seen a spate of tree 
removals, all near doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Feng shui , which means "wind and water," is based on the belief that man-made 
constructions such as buildings and roads must be placed in a certain harmony 
with nature to ensure good fortune and to prevent disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 The direction a building faces, furniture placement, street locations, birth 
dates and burial grounds of ancestors play important roles in directing 
spiritual forces that allow good luck and wealth to flow into a building, 
according to feng shui . Trees and stairways can block the forces and evil will 
head for a building at a dead end. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most conspicuous local example of a building constructed to feng 
shui specifications is in Alhambra, at Valley and Atlantic boulevards. There, 
Raymond Cheng, president of Hannon Development Inc., consulted with a feng shui 
practitioner before putting his two-story office building at a slight angle to 
the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 The facade is angled like a jagged saw blade to ensure that every door faces 
exactly south. No doors face east or west because the feng shui practitioner 
warned they would be unlucky. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Lee, Alhambra's principal planner, said he sees many plans for homes 
that incorporate feng shui principles involving the placement of the building, 
its doors and the rooms within. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, we've been able to accommodate the cultural needs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city formerly put street lights in front of store doors. But after 
complaints from Chinese store owners who said the poles were damaging their 
business because of bad feng shui , the city in recent years has been placing 
the poles out of the direct line of doorways.

EMBATTLED LIBRARY PANEL PRESIDENT LOSES SUPPORT; MONTEREY PARK: A MAJORITY OF 
CITY COUNCIL MEMBERS SAY THEY WILL NOT REAPPOINT KATHLEEN BRZOZOWSKI TO ANOTHER 
TERM. SHE WAS INVOLVED IN A RACIALLY TINGED INCIDENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The president of Monterey Park's library board is expected to lose her seat 
after she made racially tinged remarks about a fellow board member and threw a 
cup of water at a Chinese American activist. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the City Council's five members said they would not support another 
term for board President Kathleen Brzozowski after they learned this week that 
her term expired June 30, and she would need to be reappointed by the council 
to stay on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's time for some new blood," said Mayor Judy Chu, "and hopefully we 
can get the library board working together again." 
</P>
<P>
 The council on Monday set a special session for Oct. 12 to interview 
applicants for all city boards that have seats up for reappointment, including 
Brzozowski's, after earlier hearing a barrage of complaints about her from 
community activists. The deadline to apply for commission positions, including 
the library board seat, is Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Brzozowski is the only member of the five-trustee library board whose seat is 
up for reappointment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (Brzozowski) has the support of the council because of the 
events that have occurred," Councilman Francisco Alonso said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alonso, who served on the library board until his election in April, said he 
expects the council to be prudent and replace Brzozowski. 
</P>
<P>
 "I imagine some applicants of a high enough caliber will apply that we'll see 
fit to vote for someone else for the position." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rita Valenzuela, who witnessed the water-throwing incident, said 
she will vote for an applicant who will be more effective than Brzozowski at 
uniting the community and promoting the library.  
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela said public officials such as Brzozowski must behave responsibly 
and cannot afford to become angry every time a person challenges them. "Certain 
jobs require certain temperaments," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Councilman Fred Balderrama indicated in an interview Tuesday that 
he also would not support reappointing Brzozowski, although he refused to say 
so definitely. Instead, he said, "We don't like to appoint controversial 
people. . . . I've been known not to vote for the incumbent." 
</P>
<P>
 Last Thursday, other members of Monterey Park's library board called on 
Brzozowski to apologize or resign after she threw a cup of water at a Chinese 
American activist and threatened others with her walking stick. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred as she walked out before a board discussion about 
racially tinged comments she made in July about fellow library board member 
Marina Tse, a prominent resident in the city with a 56% Asian population. 
</P>
<P>
 Brzozowski had said in July that Tse "should take a low position" until she 
learned English better. 
</P>
<P>
 Brzozowski told the Chinese Daily News she felt bad about the water incident 
and would apologize for it. She told the paper she was suffering from flu at 
the time and had a car accident earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Brzozowski did not return telephone calls from The Times.

COUNTRY ROUNDUP: BAR'S BAND LINEUP INCLUDES 2 SETS OF RANGERS IN THE NIGHT; A 
SANTA CLARITA-BASED GROUP AND SOME LOCAL FAVORITES ARE SPOTLIGHTED AT 
O'CONNOR'S IN CAMARILLO.

 Several months have passed since the country karaoke venue in Camarillo known 
as the Country Rose became just a memory. Then, two months ago, after removing 
the cumbersome booths, installing a pair of pool tables, a football pennant 
decor and green neon ambient lighting, new owner Kevin O'Connor opened the 
place as -- what else -- O'Connor's Sports Bar & Grill. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday night those local favorites, the Rhythm Rangers, packed the place 
to kick off a country-rock format on the weekends. And the band will return 
Friday. So fans won't have to journey all the way to Maxie's or the Deer Lodge 
to hear them. 
</P>
<P>
 But O'Connor's plans a back-to-back band weekend with two different sets of 
Rangers, so don't get confused. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday the Santa Clarita Valley-based New West Rangers will make their 
first local appearance since May. And I'm counting on them to deliver the same 
rich vocal harmonies and danceable cover tunes I heard then. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Acree said he began the group as a rock 'n' roll band 10 years ago, but 
for the last six years the band has focused on country music. The current 
lineup (Stan Delgado, bass; Rudi Bendig, drums; Scott McIntosh, guitar and 
synthesizers; Dave Branford, lead guitar; Sharon Rohaley, backup vocals) plays 
California country rock originally influenced by the sounds of Poco, the 
Eagles, Neil Young and Jackson Browne. Acree said the group's name reflects a 
Western flavor but reminds listeners that the band offers the new style of 
country developing here on the West Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 With good looks and a lovely baritone voice, guitarist Acree, 38, is a perfect 
front man for the band. And as a songwriter, he creates pleasing original 
lyrics. Listen for his signature compositions, including "Baby Steps," which 
has aired on KZLA radio; "Colorado," a beautiful slow two-step, and an 
infectious fast two-step called "L.A. Cowboy," featuring a great drum backbeat 
and lush vocal harmonies. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 The new family line dance night on Wednesdays at Skating Plus in Ventura is 
going strong. But for a more intimate atmosphere, there is Nicholby's across 
town. After the dust settles from Rick Henderson's dance lessons, he dims the 
lights and plays requests for mellow couples dancing. Stop by for an adult 
beverage or cappuccino between buckle buffers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The new folks running the Borderline in Thousand Oaks have reinstated family 
night on Sundays with a barbecue 2 to 5 p.m. and an hour of dance lessons at 2 
p.m. Pony rides will be available soon. The club will remain open during next 
month's scheduled remodeling to expand the dance floor and install a patio. And 
dance fans will love the new, user-friendly graphic design of the lesson 
schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Watch the column for details, but for now, save these dates: Oct. 12 through 
16, the Ojai Valley Gun Club will present the 23rd annual Sespe Rendezvous -- 
five days of camping, muzzle-loader target competition, family entertainment, 
and on the 15th, a barbecue and dancing to a live band. (485-8917 or 647-1976). 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 15, Restless Heart and Shiloh will perform at the Community Memorial 
Healthcare Foundation Fourth Annual Gold Dust Gala in Ventura. (652-5009). 
</P>
<P>
 California Lutheran University has chosen "Return to Dodge City" as the theme 
of its 30th anniversary celebration and homecoming weekend, Oct. 28 through 30. 
Activities will include line dance instruction at the barn and stables on 
campus followed by a field trip to the nearby Thousand Oaks Borderline. Calling 
all members of the Class of '70 -- this means you. (492-2411)

GRANT BRINGS COMMUNITY POLICING TO INGLEWOOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Inglewood Police Department is going back to school to get reacquainted 
with the city's neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Using $1 million from a federal grant, the city hired nine police officers to 
spearhead a community policing program based in the city's elementary schools. 
The first of four public safety centers opened Saturday at Oak Street 
Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The program is designed to complement and enforce neighborhood watch programs, 
said Councilman Jose Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 "These guys are going to find out what's going on in the neighborhoods," 
Fernandez said. "We are dealing with vigilance and with the police knowing the 
area, not just driving by." 
</P>
<P>
 The four-officer team works out of a converted classroom equipped with 
computers connected to police headquarters, fax machines and two-way radios. 
They will patrol the campus and surrounding 10-block area on foot. 
</P>
<P>
 The school centers serve as a local branch of the police department, where 
residents can report crimes or have children fingerprinted. Local community 
service programs such as food distribution for the needy can also be 
coordinated there, said Herb Aguirre, the lead officer at the Oak Street 
center. Officials said the centers will not be used as a detention facility for 
suspects unless a suspect is apprehended on the school campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The object (of the program) is to get people to be comfortable in dealing 
with the police," Aguirre said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the lead officer, the centers are staffed by a second patrol 
officer, a Drug Abuse and Resistance Education (DARE) officer, and several 
volunteers, Aguirre said. The department is training neighborhood residents 
interested in volunteering their time to handle phone calls and to help 
visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 The three other centers are scheduled to open in the coming months, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oak Street center opened with a 2K run and fingerprinting drive that drew 
nearly 500 children, parents, police officials, teachers and school 
administrators, said Oak Street's principal, Yolanda Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
 Mendoza said the program is well-suited to be run in the elementary schools. 
"It's a good building place for (officer-child) relationships. We're building 
respect here and the kids are getting familiar with the officers," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1-million grant, awarded by the U.S. Department of Justice last year, is 
used primarily for salaries and benefits for the officers and will expire after 
three years. But Aguirre said the city will pick up the tab when the grant runs 
out.

 One day before the school year began for the 8,600 students of the Palos 
Verdes Peninsula Unified School District, Ann N. Chlebicki, 44, was named 
superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlebicki will earn $104,000 a year under a three-year contract unanimously 
approved by the school board Sept. 7.The contract begins Oct. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Chlebicki was assistant superintendent of instructional services for the 
28,000-student Saddleback Valley Unified School District in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was checking (Chlebicki's) references, just about everybody was very 
negative -- about the prospect of losing her," said board member Barry J. 
Hildebrand, a trustee. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she will continue to live in Huntington Beach.

PANEL SUGGESTS SENIOR HOUSING ON NAVY LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Housing for senior citizens will be built on 27 acres of surplus Navy property 
in San Pedro if a group of local residents gets its way. 
</P>
<P>
 In a document released last week, the San Pedro Area Reuse Committee said 
senior housing is the best use of the land at Taper Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilman Rudy Svorinich Jr., who represents the harbor district, 
appointed the committee earlier this year to look at options for military land 
left vacant in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee has been concentrating on the Taper Avenue site, which has been 
at the center of community debate and concern since it was announced in January 
that its 144 housing units would be used for up to 880 homeless people. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials approved an application by Turner's Technical Institute 
Inc., a South-Central homeless advocacy organization, to run the homeless 
shelter after the Long Beach Naval Station closes this month.  
</P>
<P>
 The committee plan for senior housing assumes that Turner's plan will be 
derailed, secretary Jerry Gaines said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is a wish list," Gaines said. "It hasn't been cleared up yet as to 
whether or not federal screening is finished. But the senior housing use would 
be most preferred by the community, particularly those around the property." 
</P>
<P>
 The report also says a smaller homeless shelter run by local organizations 
could be viable. 
</P>
<P>
 Samuel Theus, Turner's spokesman, said the institute would consider working 
with the San Pedro groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it would have to be a program for homeless people," Theus said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the alternatives are, but I do know that (Turner's) is 
going ahead every day to get closer and closer to what we need to make that 
program work." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the committee's plan, the housing would include affordable houses, 
assisted living, a nursing home, geriatric day care, a recreation center, open 
space and walking trails. Outreach programs also would operate from the 
complex.  
</P>
<P>
 The report says the number of senior citizens in the San Pedro/Wilmington area 
living in poverty increased 26% between 1980 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 The report says the need, feasibility and community support for Turner's 
proposal is low.  
</P>
<P>
 However, it suggests other options for the site, including affordable housing, 
single-family residences, a police special training facility, public 
recreation, a nature preserve, an educational facility and Air Force housing. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations will be discussed at a public hearing Sept. 29, at 7 p.m. 
in Peck Park Auditorium, 560 N. Western Ave., San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the federal department of Health and Human Services is 
reviewing the homeless shelter plan by Turner's Institute in light of strong 
community and political opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling Hills) has urged department Secretary Donna E. 
Shalala to reopen applications because the Department of Housing and Urban 
Development recently disqualified 60% of the Taper Avenue housing for homeless 
use because of its proximity to aviation fuel tanks.  
</P>
<P>
 Gaines said the senior citizen housing could be built outside the danger zone 
from the tanks.  
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials have not informed Theus that some of the Taper Avenue 
property is no longer suitable, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Turner's application for the shelter was approved under the Stewart B. 
McKinney Homeless Assistance Act of 1987. The legislation gives homeless 
providers priority for surplus federal land. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal representatives including Harman, Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Rep. Doug 
Bereuter (R-Nebraska) have been working on amendments to the McKinney Act and 
other federal legislation where it affects military property. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the San Pedro committee is working with another homeless group, 
Friends of the Crossing, which is interested in applying for a former military 
site known as 6A, on Seaside Avenue on Terminal Island.

JUDGE RULES SECURITY CHIEF'S FIRING EXCESSIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An administrative law judge has ruled that the firing of former Pasadena 
Unified School District security chief Charles Parcell was excessive and that 
Parcell should be given back his job. 
</P>
<P>
 In his Sept. 8 ruling, Administrative Law Judge Richard Ranger stated that 
Parcell should have been suspended for 90 days for allegedly filing a false 
police report in September, 1992, but should not have been fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case should have been avoided," Ranger wrote in his final ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a case involving events that should have never happened. . . . It is 
about ordinarily responsible school leaders acting like schoolchildren 
conducting a prank." 
</P>
<P>
 After being accused of filing a false police report over a computer that was 
reported stolen, Parcell, a 26-year employee of the school district, was placed 
on administrative leave and then fired in March, 1993. The computer had been 
moved from another department. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 1, 1993, Parcell was found innocent of one misdemeanor count of filing 
a false police report. 
</P>
<P>
 It is now up to the Pasadena Board of Education to either accept or appeal 
Ranger's ruling. If the board appeals the ruling, a Los Angeles County Superior 
Court will finally decide the issue, said Terry Bennett, Parcell's attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members could not be reached for comment. Supt. Vera Vignes was 
also unavailable. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's interesting is the judge wants to put me back to work, but the school 
district won't put me back to work," Parcell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking for total exoneration and I'm going to get it," he said.

NIGHT LIFE: HIS BRIGHTER SHADE OF THE BLUES TRAVELS WELL; FRANKIE LEE AND HIS 
COHORTS COME IN OFF THE ROAD FOR A MOMENT TO BRING THEIR GOSPEL-TINGED MUSIC TO 
NICHOLBY'S IN VENTURA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Are you so lazy you're just going to lie there until you become a sanitation 
problem? Or not even answer the door if your sexual fantasy partner is outside 
with a pizza? Too many rock stars are slothful like this. They take three years 
to make an album, tour for a few months, start every gig late, then take a few 
years off. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, there's not much moss growing on blues musicians, who always seem 
to be driving somewhere. Frankie Lee, who will be doing the Blue Monday gig at 
Nicholby's in Ventura, may be a bit more energetic than the average bluesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the band drove 900 miles in one night to get to a gig. Nine hundred 
miles! 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Texas in 1941, Lee has lived in Los Angeles, New York and now the Bay 
Area. He's driven through all points in between. Many times. 
</P>
<P>
 After high school, Lee moved to Austin and was playing the local bar scene 
when Ike and Tina Turner heard him sing and hired him as a featured vocalist. 
Later, while living in Houston, Lee had a chance to work with many of his 
idols, such as Big Mama Thornton, Bobby (Blue) Bland, Clarence (Gatemouth) 
Brown and Buddy Ace. In 1963, as Little Frankie Lee, he made his first 
recording, "Full Time Love." 
</P>
<P>
 Next, Lee left the Lone Star State with guitar whiz Albert Collins and toured 
with him for six years. By 1971, Lee was in L.A., playing with his cousin, 
Johnny (Guitar) Watson. By 1973, Lee had moved to the Bay Area, as the 
recurring pattern of his itchy feet became irrefutable. Anyway, Lee hasn't even 
slowed down, and now he has a new album to promote: "Going Back Home," on Blind 
Pig Records. Lee talked things over before a one-night stand in Winnipeg, 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine hundred miles on the road in one night? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm on the go, man. We drove from Calgary, Alberta, to Winnipeg -- it's a 
little more than 900 miles. No, that's not a record -- we've done 12 or 13 
hundred miles in a (single stretch) before. I'm on the road about nine or 10 
months a year, and I'll be on the road the rest of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 What's up with the new album? 
</P>
<P>
 It's doing good -- that's why I'm on the road. I got to stay ahead of it and 
keep an eye on it. It's doing good in Canada, but it's only been out for a 
couple of weeks. It's been getting a lot of press; people are excited and I'm 
excited. We got the best musicians in the Bay Area for that one. I was going 
for the gusto. It was an opportunity that I never had before. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you get the blues? 
</P>
<P>
 I'm doing this because this is what I want to do. I've always wanted to do 
this all my life. I first heard the blues when I was a kid and could first 
recognize music. Some of my family was into the blues, but I was raised by my 
grandparents and my grandmother was a big missionary worker in the church. I 
was brought up very strictly and blues was "the devil's music." She wasn't too 
enthused with the blues. I used to sneak out and go places for a little while. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the blues getting bigger or smaller? 
</P>
<P>
 It's getting bigger every day, man. More and more people are coming to see 
that the blues are not a downer, but an upper. Youngsters have always felt that 
blues were down, and I'm bringing another dimension to them. People think blues 
is about being down and out, holes in your shoes, sleeping outdoors. It's not 
true. There's bigger audiences out there now. Kids come up to me all the time 
and tell me that this is what they been missing and this is what they want. 
Only college radio plays the blues, and you know who listens to college radio? 
College kids. The major stations are playing rap and stuff, but not blues. Even 
the (Grammy organizers don't) know what blues is. I looked at the groups that 
were up for Grammys last year. I don't know what that stuff was, but it wasn't 
blues. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell me about Ike and Tina Turner. 
</P>
<P>
 I was just thinking about them the other night. That was one of the highlights 
of my career. I was into their music -- that was the kind of stuff I wanted to 
hear. After I saw their show, I knew that was what I wanted to do onstage. 
Later that night, I was jamming around Austin and they came to my show. I was 
like 21 or 22 years old, didn't know nothin'. He invited me to their hotel and 
Ike asked me if I could travel. He told me he liked my singing, which gave me a 
lot of confidence. He gave me that shot of confidence that I needed -- it was 
like a dream come true. I learned stage presence from him. I didn't know 
nothin' about taking a bow, or a standing ovation, what's that? 
</P>
<P>
 You lived in L.A. and now the Bay Area. When the Dodgers come to town, whose 
side are you on? 
</P>
<P>
 I like the Giants, the Dodgers are OK too, but I'm not really that much into 
baseball. I'm more into football because I played it all through high school. 
I've been a 49ers fan since 1952. Back then they were so bad, they couldn't 
beat a high school team. This year, it looks like back to the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Describe Frankie Lee music. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm just like the 49ers -- up and down, just like a seesaw. I play more of an 
R & B style as opposed to a straight-ahead blues. It's a '50s feel with a '90s 
flair. My music has a gospel feel. I've never lost that gospel feeling -- the 
seed was planted when I was 2 or 3 years old. I may not get rich, but I won't 
go hungry, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Tell me about a strange gig. 
</P>
<P>
 I've had quite a few of those. One time, a long time ago, we played this club 
in a little town. Victoria, Texas. When we were done, we went into the office 
to get our money. This guy had money stacked everywhere, and with a big pistol 
sitting on his desk right in the middle. So he picks up this pistol and says, 
"I ain't paying you no money." We got mad, but we left. We didn't mess with 
that guy anymore. I figured if this business is going to be like this, to heck 
with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Anywhere you haven't been to yet? 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, there is. I want to go to a few places abroad like Norway, Australia and 
New Zealand. I understand those people are just now learning about the blues.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EL CAMINO COMMUNITY COLLEGE; BOARD OKS AUSTERE BUDGET WITHOUT 
RAISES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Academic and administrative departments have been asked to cut back to help 
balance a budget that has shrunk $2 million over the last two years. The 
college's board passed the 1994-95 budget unanimously at its meeting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 faculty members attended the meeting to hear a discussion of 
wage rates. Teachers have complained that the $54.6-million budget does not 
include raises for the faculty, who have not received increases in three years. 
Contract talks have been held for nearly two years, including sessions with a 
state mediator, but administrators say raises are impossible due to dwindling 
state funds. 
</P>
<P>
 College spokeswoman Mary Ann Keating said the school would not lay off any 
employees, but that workers who leave may not be replaced. Departmental 
cutbacks should be enough to balance the budget, Keating said.

STILL CATCHING WAVES -- ON FILM; SURFING: CHRIS BYSTROM, 44, HAS INFLUENCED A 
LEGION OF ENTHUSIASTS SINCE HIS FIRST MOVIE IN THE 1970S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Like many artists, movie maker Chris Bystrom believes in sacrifice -- real 
renunciation. 
</P>
<P>
 So Bystrom quits surfing for months at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 The 44-year-old travels to exotic beaches around the world making 
documentaries about surfing. But as he peers through his camera lens to film 
the best waves, he often battles the urge to wax down his surfboard and paddle 
out for a ride. 
</P>
<P>
 It may not be a diet of bread and water, but for a lifelong surfer it's a 
tough call. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I made such crummy films," Bystrom says of the first few movies he 
made in the 1970s. "I was always surfing when the waves were at their best."  
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, Bystrom's movies improved and inspired legions of South Bay 
surfers. Many trekked to the Bijou Twin Theatres in Hermosa Beach to study the 
sport's latest, most radical moves and raced a couple blocks to the beach to 
test their mettle. 
</P>
<P>
 Bystrom, who grew up riding waves off Redondo Beach, often leaves his 
surfboard behind when he heads for the shores to film surfers. His 20th film, 
"Full Cycle," was recently released on video. 
</P>
<P>
 With its images of graceful surfers gliding effortlessly on long, rolling 
waves, the film is a far cry from Bystrom's first few movies, which featured 
mostly poorly shaped waves crashing along San Diego beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bystrom makes no apologies for the quality of his early films or his 
penchant for surfing instead of filming when the waves reached their peak. 
</P>
<P>
 "My idea of life was being retired until you're 35, and when your body starts 
to age more, then you start to work," says Bystrom, who lives and surfs on the 
Gold Coast of Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 Until he reached his early 30s, Bystrom lived in quasi-retirement. In the late 
1960s, he acted in "Viet Rock," a Hermosa Beach interactive play in which peace 
activists shook audience members violently and demanded that they protest the 
Vietnam War. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he moved to San Diego after two years of college and sold used records 
out of the trunk of his 1955 Pontiac. He spent countless hours along the shores 
of Ocean Beach, where he cruised the waves on his wax-covered, single-fin 
surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Bystrom remembers those years as carefree, but he "had an artistic streak not 
being fulfilled by the bohemian lifestyle," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 So while living in a San Diego garage in the early 1970s, Bystrom scraped 
together $500 to buy a small, secondhand movie camera, which he used to film 
crushing waves on a trip down the Mexican coast. At the urging of friends, he 
began filming surfers throughout Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 In time, the surf movies "became a form of artistic expression," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bystrom bought a better camera and soon began showing his films in school 
auditoriums and small theaters around the state, where he provided live 
narration. But it was often difficult to make ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 When schools refused to charge admission and instead solicited donations, 
Bystrom says he "made sure I had the biggest and meanest-looking guy at the 
door to make sure everybody pitched in." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, he released "Blazing Boards" to auditoriums of screaming surf fans. 
The film attracted 1,800 people to the Santa Cruz Civic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had the best guys in the world on film," says Dickie O'Reilly, 21, a 
Manhattan Beach surfer who was 10 when he first saw the movie. O'Reilly now 
works at Spyder Surfboards in Hermosa Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've sold tons of his movies over the years," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Bystrom says he has sold 1,000 copies of his latest release, which retails for 
$35. He says that with the profits from the movie he'll have time to relax with 
his wife and 4-year-old son before he begins his next project. 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to produce an Australian television show about surfing. And, when the 
waves roll into the Gold Coast in November, Bystrom says he will leave his 
camera behind and surf the curling waves until the swells retreat in April.

COUNTY FAIR; FORECAST FOR NEXT TWO WEEKS: (COUNTY) FAIR DAYS, HOT WEATHER; 
OPENING DAY ATTENDANCE WAS UP; SO WAS THE HEAT -- 102 DEGREES. MORE THAN ONE 
MILLION VISITORS ARE EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENEE TAWA, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's hard not to love a county fair with its Spam Lite cooking contest, its 
love potion peddler, its pig information woman who insists that pigs would be 
running this country if only they could talk. 
</P>
<P>
 But the world is full of "if onlys," and the first days of the 67th Los 
Angeles County Fair -- bless its heart -- were no exception. If only it weren't 
so brow-mopping hot.  
</P>
<P>
 Through the first weekend of the nation's largest county fair, which opened 
Friday, the thermometer hovered in the high 90s and low 100s, said fair 
spokesman Sid Robinson. Temperatures cooled early this week, but it is likely 
to heat up again this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one million visitors are expected before the fair closes Oct. 2. 
Opening day attendance was 30,485, up 19% from last year. And on the fair's 
first day, the temperature was 102 degrees by noon. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so hot that Lady Angelica the llama wouldn't budge from her spot in 
front of a portable fan in the livestock barn. It was so hot that a frisky, 
week-old pygmy goat waited until the cooler evening hours to plot an escape 
through her pen's wide bars. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so hot that 45-year-old Fred Lezy of West Hills bought a large lemonade 
and made a beeline for the shaded livestock pens. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was getting hot out there," said Lezy, a trade show decorator wearing a 
black T-shirt and Harley-Davidson cap. "I was going, 'Whoa. Can I take it? Get 
me to the animals.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tips to beat the heat on the 487-acre fairgrounds: Duck into the commercial 
exhibit buildings, which are air-conditioned. Food vendors will provide free 
water upon request. Don't forget to drop by the ice-skating rink. 
</P>
<P>
 And think about how hard the heat would be for a 60-pound pregnant goat. Three 
of them, to be exact. 
</P>
<P>
 Pity Sascha, Tasha and Sabrina, the pygmy goats standing out in the sweltering 
heat. Each is about two months pregnant -- all of them paired with a buck named 
Bahama because "he had a good reputation," said their owner, Linda Williams of 
Alta Loma. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, sure, Williams spoils the goats with bread -- they prefer whole wheat to 
sourdough -- and transports them in her air-conditioned car. But there is 
judging ahead, and imagine the pressure on the pygmy goats, which stand about 2 
feet tall, with judges clucking over too much white hair in the belly area or 
not enough speckling in the ears. For pregnant pygmies, though, the extra girth 
might help, Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the stuff that county fairs are made of, said 23-year-old Alfredo 
Figueroa, who arrived at the gates at 10 a.m. on opening day and planned to 
stay until 11 p.m. closing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an old-fashioned fair," said the Van Nuys woodworker. "We live in the 
city. We don't get to see animals and stuff. You learn a lot of things."

COMMUNITY NEWS: LOMITA; SEPARATE SCHOOL DISTRICT WINS HEARTY SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY GUTHRIE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supporters of an independent school district here turned out to 
enthusiastically endorse their cause at a public hearing Tuesday in Lomita. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 people attended the meeting, which was another step in the process 
of creating an independent district for about 2,500 Lomita schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the drive say the Los Angeles Unified School District is too big 
and distant to address Lomita's school needs.  
</P>
<P>
 The district would include three school sites, one of which would become a 
high school: Eshelman Avenue Elementary, Lomita Elementary and Fleming Middle 
School. It would serve students in kindergarten through high school.  
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 2 the case for an independent district in Lomita will go before the 
county Committee on School District Organization. The committee is expected to 
make a recommendation to the state Board of Education at its Dec. 7 or Jan. 4 
meeting. MARY GUTHRIE

 David L. Ryal, who is also an ordained minister in the Church of Christ, will 
take over the top seat at the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, some chamber executives have created controversy by publicly 
criticizing City Council actions. The council, in turn, cut funding for the 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last 16 months, Ryal has operated his own business and marketing 
consulting firm.

<P>
 The California Environmental Protection Agency will hold two public hearings 
Wednesday on a proposed environmental report for a hazardous waste facility. 
</P>
<P>
 An independent contractor will write the report for ENSCO West Inc., which 
began operating on East Denni Street in Wilmington on March 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The company treats and disposes of hazardous waste and can store up to 100,000 
gallons of waste on the two-acre property. It does not handle radioactive 
materials or explosives, ENSCO General Manager Scot Shoemaker told residents at 
a recent Wilmington North Neighborhood Assn. meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 ENSCO has been operating under temporary authorization from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The meetings will be at the Wilmington Boys and Girls Club, 1444 W. Q St., at 
2 and 7 p.m. SUSAN WOODWARD

COMMUNITY NEWS: GARDENA; CARD CLUB EXPANSION FACES COUNCIL VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to vote Sept. 27 on a proposed ordinance to 
double the number of card tables allowed in Gardena's two card clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 The change in the city code was requested by Councilman Mas Fukai, who said he 
heard rumors that the state wanted to limit the number of card clubs throughout 
California, City Manager Kenneth W. Landau said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gives us the opportunity to allow the two existing clubs in the city to 
expand, if they want to," Landau said. 
</P>
<P>
 The two clubs -- the El Dorado at Redondo Beach Boulevard and Vermont Avenue 
and the Normandie Club on Rosecrans Avenue -- contribute a combined $5 million 
a year to the city, Landau said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new ordinance, each club could have 250 tables for poker and Asian 
card games. SUSAN WOODWARD

COMMUNITY NEWS: HERMOSA BEACH; COUNCIL REJECTS PLAN FOR PRAYER AT SESSIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BENNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council voted against a plan to open its meetings with a 
nondenominational prayer, but agreed to consider using an opening invocation 
that does not refer to a "higher power."  
</P>
<P>
 While many South Bay city councils begin meetings with prayers, Hermosa Beach 
does not.Councilmen J. R. Reviczky and Sam Y. Edgerton supported the plan, 
arguing that an opening prayer would set a reverential tone for each meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mayor Robert (Burgie) Benz and council members Julie A. Oakes and John 
Bowler opposed the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have one government meeting after another that begins with a prayer and 
turns into hypocrisy and infighting," Bowler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council vote disappointed Hermosa Beach resident Karen Johnson, who told 
the council she recently organized a prayer group in the city. She hopes the 
council will soon come to an agreement on an opening invocation, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a simple vote," she said. "You're either voting in favor of godliness 
or godlessness." JAMES BENNING

<P>
 The Tournament of Roses, which has come under fire in recent years for its 
lack of minority and women members, has announced that 45% of the nonprofit 
organization's contracts last fiscal year went to minorities and women. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization, which produces the annual Rose Parade and Rose Bowl game, 
spent $775,000 with businesses owned by women and minorities.It spent a total 
of $1.72 million last year. Officials say it easily surpassed its goal of doing 
25% of its business with women and minority-owned businesses.  
</P>
<P>
 Of the 45% of association dollars going to women/minorities, women-owned firms 
got 36%, while minorities received 9%. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournament, responding to charges of discrimination last year, expanded 
its executive committee to include women and minorities.

<P>
 Tomorrow's opening of "Man of La Mancha" in the 350-seat Forum Theater is 
nearly sold out. Sales for subsequent performances -- on the Friday, Saturday 
and Sunday of each weekend through Oct. 29 -- are brisk. 
</P>
<P>
 Roughly 20 seats remain for single-ticket sales for each of the shows, with 
slightly fewer available on opening night and Saturday night performances, 
according to box office reports. Season ticket subscriptions, are beyond sales 
projections as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For single tickets, call Santa Susana Repertory at 374-8282; for season 
tickets, call 449-ARTS. 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Santa Susana also will present "The Boys in Autumn" in February -- for 
single ticket sales only. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening night and Saturday night will feature modest receptions to which 
ticket holders are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 But the main opening ceremonies of the Civic Arts Plaza will be reserved until 
the main stage opens with Bernadette Peters the weekend of Oct. 21. LEONARD

CENTERPIECE: DIRECTING THE DREAM; AS THE CIVIC ARTS PLAZA SEASON OPENS WITH 
'MAN OF LA MANCHA' ON FRIDAY, THE QUEST BECOMES HOW TO BALANCE CREATIVITY WITH 
PROFITABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEONARD REED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For nearly all of the 30 years Thousand Oaks has existed, there has been talk 
of a major performing arts center -- a dream of a place where the world's great 
entertainers might share the same stage with home-grown, home-based, home-proud 
performers. 
</P>
<P>
 It's done. Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 The Civic Arts Plaza in Thousand Oaks lifts the first of its two stage 
curtains for the first time Friday night. Fittingly, "Man of La Mancha," 
drama's durable quest for the impossible dream, will be mounted by the Santa 
Susana Repertory Company on the Arts Plaza's handsome but smaller Forum Theatre 
stage. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the half of it. Almost. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's opening presages by nearly a month the grand opening of the Arts 
Plaza's main auditorium, center of big-ticket action and, plainly, the venue 
that got the place built. That show will feature Bernadette Peters and the 
Conejo Valley Symphony. In subsequent months, be ready for Ray Charles and 
Willie Nelson and Tony Bennett and Anne Murray and Liza Minnelli. 
</P>
<P>
 Pulling it together has been epic -- an effort that reaches far beyond 
completing construction on the sculptural, $65-million facility designed by 
famed architect Antoine Predock. Selecting the programs to mount -- bold or 
timid, provocative or safe -- in a scant few months has been the largest of 
recent challenges. Programming, after all, is the heart of a performing arts 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has been in a dead gallop," says Larry Janss, a force not only in 
getting the center built but in defining the broad class of shows that will 
initially dominate both the main and small stages. "None of us has opened a 
regional performing arts center before. We're making it up as we go. We don't 
want to arrive a day late and a dollar short." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A day late and a dollar short. 
</P>
<P>
 The axiom -- or the fear that it might prove true -- has fueled program 
choices in recent months and serves as a guide to understanding not only the 
selection of this weekend's opener but the entire season's lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike numerous performing arts centers that receive subsidies from the cities 
that built them, the Civic Arts Plaza must generate enough revenue to pay for 
itself. The Thousand Oaks City Council voted such a decree. 
</P>
<P>
 That means mainstream, popular programming will dominate in the moneymaking 
1,800-seat main auditorium -- with local, less commercial, less-at-stake 
ventures in the Forum Theatre, which seats as few as 278 and as many as 398. 
The result is a cultural bifurcation of sorts. 
</P>
<P>
 The main auditorium will be the venue for which the Arts Plaza might become a 
well-known regional facility, drawing patrons from the San Fernando Valley and 
Santa Barbara. The Forum will be the prime outlet for Ventura County's artistic 
expression. 
</P>
<P>
 On Nov. 19, for example, when Vegas showroom veteran Paul Anka croons on the 
main stage at tickets ranging from $30 to $50, the Westlake Cultural Foundation 
will be launching a "Salute to Youth" concert in the Forum with tickets at $20. 
On March 24, 1995, when superstar Liza Minnelli packs the main house on tickets 
starting at $60 and topping out at $90, the country-singing twins Janet & Judy 
will be featured in the Forum in the Conejo Valley Children's Concert Series 
sponsored by Conejo Valley Adult School, AM-850 radio and The Oaks mall. 
</P>
<P>
 The notable exception to this in-house culture divide, of course, involves the 
resident Conejo Symphony Orchestra. This local symphony, featuring many 
first-class professionals, goes from years of being marooned in a gymnasium at 
Cal Lutheran University to performing on the main stage with such big-ticket 
artists as Pinchas Zuckerman and Glenn Dicterow. It will be a new day for this 
orchestra, not to mention its avid local following. 
</P>
<P>
 If anything marks the tone and style of the inaugural season's program, it is 
that the entertainment is uniformly middle-of-the-road and crowd-pleasing. 
Instead of Andrew Dice Clay, there's Howie Mandell and Bill Cosby; instead of a 
production of "The Piano Lesson," there's "42nd Street" and "A Chorus Line"; 
instead of Metallica there's Kenny Loggins; instead of the Toshiko Akiyoshi 
Jazz Orchestra, there's museum jazz in the form of the Preservation Hall Jazz 
Band. 
</P>
<P>
 Only, perhaps, the Santa Susana's Forum production in February of Bernard 
Sabath's "The Boys in Autumn," to some a disturbing portrayal of Tom Sawyer and 
Huck Finn in their final years, could be considered provocative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well it is very safe, very commercial," says the city's theaters director, 
Tom Mitze, of the first-season lineup. "This is a family-oriented community, 
and what you see represents family-oriented programming. I don't expect 
problems in the concerts or letters of complaint about language in the theater 
shows or comedy performances." 
</P>
<P>
 Janss, who once booked Ray Charles in his nightclub Shades, is even more 
pragmatic: "We need to balance community representation and star-driven 
entertainment. It's daunting to fill the big auditorium, and we've got bills to 
pay. We're not starting off looking for controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 He pauses a moment, adding: "We need to crawl before we walk, to get it right. 
. . . We're just not going to put 2 Live Crew in there calling for rape and 
murder." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Choices for the major musical concerts, however, are not made by anyone in 
Thousand Oaks. Those have been farmed out to Avalon Attractions, an 
Encino-based promotion company that successfully bid to rent the main stage for 
roughly 40 weekends of the year and take responsibility for mounting profitable 
concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as Avalon hews to the Thousand Oaks middle-of-the-road sensibility and 
to packing the house with crowd-pleasers, the major concert choices are 
exclusively Avalon's. Asked whether Avalon, in effect, thus becomes this 
region's arbiter of major concert opportunities, Janss smiles and says: "Well, 
yes, that's true. It is really up to Avalon. They're the experts at this level 
of booking. And they are driven first by keeping their company profitable." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Masters is Avalon's talent executive and no newcomer to the business, 
having once run the black music (now urban music) department of the William 
Morris Agency in Los Angeles. He also is deeply involved with Avalon's contract 
to program shows at Irvine Meadows Amphitheater. 
</P>
<P>
 As the man whose choices set the tone projected by the new Civic Arts Plaza, 
Masters is surprisingly casual about his methods. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no method, I guarantee you that," he says, laughing. "It's many 
factors, really. Some of it is common sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take Michael Feinstein -- not exactly a hot ticket in L.A. But he does big 
business in Palm Springs, and we're talking about an upscale community around 
the Arts Plaza. These people know him and like his music, which is Rodgers and 
Hart. That's why he's on the bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Arts Plaza director Mitze amplifies Masters' assessment of the audience. 
"There is a suburban consciousness to this area," he says. "Cutting-edge 
programs, like jazz, are often better in more bohemian settings. I don't think 
Philip Glass' music would work too well here. And you could never do the 
Brooklyn Academy of Music's 'Next Wave' festival here, for example." 
</P>
<P>
 Fine by Masters. His only constraint was time: He had only three months from 
getting the green light until August, when he needed to have program brochures 
printed and distributed. But he found available for hire Kenny Rogers, Shirley 
MacLaine, Willie Nelson, Tony Bennett, Kenny Loggins, Liza Minnelli, among 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is what I do for a living," says Masters. "I buy a whole lot of shows 
for a lot of places, and I have relationships. That, coupled with the 
excitement about that new building -- I find it to be a wonderful European 
classical setup in a modern structure -- made it happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, however, other factors make it happen. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Smokey Robinson recently played golf with Thousand Oaks Mayor Alex 
Fiore and noted, sadly, that he wasn't on the bill. Fiore called Mitze, who 
called Masters, who called Robinson's manager, who called Robinson. Dec. 9 is 
now the Smokey Robinson show. 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes even the experienced Masters, who once lived in West Hills and 
professes to "kind of know something about the area," finds himself surprised. 
Willie Nelson's show, with ticket prices from $25 to $45, sold out in a 
heartbeat -- before anyone else -- requiring an additional show. 
</P>
<P>
 "That did surprise me," says Masters. "But you can bet that told me to buy 
more country. And I will." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While market demand and community values drive the Arts Plaza's first offering 
of major concert and dramatic production choices, other factors thicken the 
stew. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitze says his first job is to mill about the lobbies of both theaters to 
"listen to what people say. Our shows must reflect and challenge the cultural 
appetite of the surrounding communities." 
</P>
<P>
 But the line between reflecting and challenging a community can be quite thin, 
even blurred. Mitze, who comes to Thousand Oaks from running the La Mirada 
performing arts center, recalls that community's somewhat conflicted response 
to the show "Follies." 
</P>
<P>
 That show, a sanitized version of the casino show, nonetheless features 
scantily clad dancers. But the costumes offered more coverage "than you'd see 
at the beach," says Mitze. Curiously, letters of protest poured in. Mitze 
invited the critics in for a show to help him understand what was going on. His 
conclusion: "Everybody does, in fact, like 'Follies.' But the problem was that 
people felt that kind of show belonged in Las Vegas -- not their neighborhood." 
</P>
<P>
 No sooner did Mitze decode that mystery than La Mirada launched the 
provocative play, "The Mind With the Dirty Man," starring Don Knotts. In an 
effort to forestall criticism, Mitze offered subscribers the option of dropping 
one of the season's five productions -- each clearly described in the season's 
brochures. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Dirty Man' was the one show nobody dropped," says a laughing Mitze. "So who 
can really tell?" 
</P>
<P>
 That doesn't mean Mitze, whose cultural tastes are wide-ranging, won't do his 
darndest to find out. Because he's first in charge to make sure the Civic Arts 
Plaza makes a go of it -- and will save the talk about regional cultural 
aspiration till later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I make my living selling tickets," he says. "I'm not an angel. I work too 
hard making money to enjoy losing it. I'm a conservative person in a risky 
business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the honeymoon year" for the Arts Plaza, says Larry Janss. "We can do 
no wrong. In the second year, the blush will be off. That's where the challenge 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 That's also where Janss believes the real work of establishing the Arts 
Plaza's cultural constellation begins. Is it forever market-driven 
entertainment? Or is it sometimes risky? Will it sometimes veer off-center? 
</P>
<P>
 As part of meeting that challenge, Janss, a prominent developer in this 
region, founded the Gold Coast Performing Arts Assn., which pools 
administrative, fund-raising and logistics costs for the Arts Plaza's three 
resident companies: Santa Susana Repertory, Cabrillo Music Theatre and the 
Young Artists Ensemble. Gold Coast's fund-raising will aim at providing upfront 
production costs for mounting original shows -- a subsidy that would seed this 
region's burgeoning talents in music, dance and theater, and very likely affect 
the nature of its programming. 
</P>
<P>
 On a larger scale, Janss chairs the Founders Circle, a group within the 
Alliance for the Arts, the Arts Plaza's key fund-raising arm. The Founders 
Circle seeks to establish a $10-million endowment for the Civic Arts Plaza and 
it's already well beyond the halfway mark. 
</P>
<P>
 The first goal of the endowment is to ensure that the arts programs remain 
self-supporting. To that end, the first $250,000 in annual earnings off the 
endowment principal will cover fixed costs at the center. But anything after 
that may be used to subsidize shows of particular cultural interest that may 
cost more than a mere 1,800 tickets can buy. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Luciano Pavarotti, whom Masters considers the No. 1 attraction -- no 
matter what market he's singing in. Pavarotti's per-show fee starts at $250,000 
to $300,000 -- $150 a seat might not even cover it at the Arts Plaza. But he 
did appear in Pasadena's far smaller 1,200-seat Ambassador theater a few years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the right funding, the right subsidy," says Mitze, "you can do 
anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The endowment efforts thus gird the Arts Plaza's future and with it the 
ability to program shows beyond what the marketplace virtually guarantees as 
financial and popular successes. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing, availability, cultural appetite, community values, whim, subsidy -- 
all figure in programming a season at the Civic Arts Plaza, which Friday, on 
the smaller of its two stages, does perhaps the largest job of all: takes the 
impossible out of the dream.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH PASADENA; CITY ORDERED TO PAY EX-MAYOR'S LEGAL FEES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's bill in its legal battle against former Mayor Lee D. Prentiss has 
risen to nearly $1.8 million after a judge ordered the city to pay attorney's 
fees in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena Superior Court Judge J. Michael Byrne last week ordered the city to 
pay $248,000 in legal fees accumulated by Prentiss in addition to an 
outstanding jury award of $1.2 million and more than $300,000 for its 
attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury awarded Prentiss the money in July after determining that city 
officials had violated Prentiss' civil rights in 1990 by conspiring to revoke a 
building permit to expand his 86-year-old home.  
</P>
<P>
 South Pasadena officials say the city does not have insurance to cover civil 
rights claims and will be forced to use up funds earmarked for emergencies and 
new equipment to cover the mounting bill. The almost $1.5 million owed is 
nearly 19% of the city's budget.

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Court of Appeal has invalidated a restraining order that prevented 
Councilman Isaac Richard from approaching or telephoning fellow Councilman 
Chris Holden except on official business. 
</P>
<P>
 The three-judge panel found that a Superior Court judge erred last October in 
granting the injunction against Richard based on one incident; Richard yelled 
at and threatened Holden the month before during a UCLA football game at the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 The Court of Appeal found last week that the one incident did not constitute a 
pattern of harassment that warranted a restraining order.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SAN MARINO; LIBRARY GETS ITEMS OF BLACK BALLET COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A pioneer in African American classic ballet has given the Huntington Library 
a 270-item collection chronicling the 10-year history of the country's first 
minority ballet company. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Rickard, a white choreographer who recently died at the age of 75, 
founded the "First Negro Classic Ballet" in 1947 after being outraged at the 
rejection of a young African American girl from a Los Angeles ballet class. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection from the company that predated the Dance Theatre of Harlem by 
more than 20 years includes scrapbooks, photographs and music scores.  
</P>
<P>
 The company, whose members held full-time jobs as well, disbanded in 1957. The 
Huntington plans to mount an exhibit once the materials from Rickard are 
catalogued.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Pitzer College professor, who is also a gay activist, has been selected as 
one of 48 civilian hearing examiners on the Los Angeles Police Department Board 
of Rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter M. Nardi, former co-president of the Los Angeles Chapter of the Gay & 
Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation (GLAAD), was named to the post earlier this 
month by the Los Angeles Police Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Rights consists of two police officers and one civilian selected

COMMUNITY NEWS: THE REGION; WATER DISTRICT GETS $500,000 RECYCLING GRANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Upper San Gabriel Valley Municipal Water District has received a $500,000 
federal grant for a water recycling program. 
</P>
<P>
 The Water Recycle 2000 grant from the U.S. Department of the Interior will be 
used to implement a water reclamation project. 
</P>
<P>
 By using recycled water, the district will be able to rely less on imported 
water. The valley's water supply comes from three sources: natural rainfall and 
runoff, the Colorado River and the Sacramento Delta. But recent environmental 
policies have made imported water more expensive and less reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 The project's first phase is scheduled to begin in fall, 1996.

SOUTH BAY / COVER STORY; CLEANING HOUSE; MISMANAGEMENT AND DECAY TURNED THE 
SCOTTSDALE DEVELOPMENT IN CARSON INTO AN EYESORE. BUT RESIDENTS HAVE BANDED 
TOGETHER TO FIGHT CRIME AND ERASE A DECADE OF NEGLECT AND DECAY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, it was an experiment in a new way of living, a trend-setting 
housing development in a state known for such things. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than add to the vast suburban sprawl that characterized Southern 
California, a few thousand suburban pioneers decided to live in close proximity 
to their neighbors, share open space and govern themselves under democratic 
principles, safe and secure behind their guarded gates and perimeter walls. 
</P>
<P>
 It was called Scottsdale Town Houses, one of Southern California's first 
private gated condominium communities, an $18-million, 600-home development set 
on 44 acres amid light industry and vacant land in what would one day become 
Carson. Not only one of the biggest such developments of its day, it promised 
to be the shape of things to come in an increasingly crowded and unplanned 
metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 But it didn't quite turn out that way. More than a quarter century after it 
was created, Scottsdale had become a pocket of crime and decay. The roofs 
leaked, trash and abandoned cars littered the streets, the community swimming 
pool was dry, gang members and drug dealers ruled the turf. Management had 
difficulty collecting money due from residents for upkeep and improvements. 
Racial animosities split the increasingly poor population, breeding mistrust 
and resentment. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been easy to simply write Scottsdale off as another example of 
good plans gone awry. But two years ago, a group of Scottsdale residents 
decided not to give in to their community's problems. They banded together and 
fought back. 
</P>
<P>
 Progress so far has been slow, and hard won. But there has been progress 
nevertheless. And now, some Scottsdale residents believe that it may be 
possible to turn back the clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime is down, thanks in part to the arrival of a new security company. 
Repairs are being made. Despair has given way to hope. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first came here I saw a lot of drug dealing and violence," said Angel 
Leyva, a 29-year-old exterminator and father of four, who is on the complex's 
security committee. "But things are much better now. I have a family. I want a 
good place to live." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The future looked bright in August, 1964, when developer Ray Watt spoke to a 
crowd of 800 gathered to commemorate the completion of Scottsdale Town Houses 
and the transfer of control from the developer to the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have pioneered together. . . . to make your home ownership and hopefully 
your lives at Scottsdale Town Houses the rewarding experience we all wish them 
to be," Watt told the homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California had never seen anything quite like the new development. On 
the east side of Avalon Boulevard just north of Sepulveda Boulevard, the 
condominium development included beautifully landscaped streets, a grassy 
central mall, a children's playground, an Olympic-size swimming pool, and a 
community center -- all reserved for residents and their guests. A 
three-bedroom home -- they are two-story units arranged in rows -- sold then 
for about $16,000, plus a monthly fee for grounds maintenance and other 
services. (The larger units now sell for about $90,000.) 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 people were expected to live in the development. Decisions about 
the community and control of the maintenance fees were put in the hands of a 
15-member board of governors elected from among the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most unusual thing about Scottsdale was that it was surrounded 
by a four-foot masonry wall with access only through two guarded gates. The 
purpose of the walls and gates wasn't so much to protect residents from crime 
but to make sure that envious neighbors didn't slip in and use the amenities. 
</P>
<P>
 When Anthony and Lydia Chapa moved into one of the new homes in the summer of 
1964, it seemed like the perfect place for the couple and their nine children.  
</P>
<P>
 "They had Little League going for the kids; they had something going for the 
adults. . . . They had quite a few things going on," said Chapa, who still 
lives in Scottsdale with her husband. "It (was) a nice place to raise 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Sheriff's Sgt. Jerry Kaono, who grew up in the Carson area 
and watched Scottsdale being built, remembers envying the kids who lived there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing like it," said Kaono, who works in the Carson sheriff's 
station. "It had a park where they had organized baseball. They had dancing and 
meetings and games." 
</P>
<P>
 But over the years, mismanagement, poor planning and just plain bad luck 
turned Scottsdale into an eyesore whose unique features have proven to be 
almost as much a handicap as a help. 
</P>
<P>
 Through a complex series of business deals, many of the Scottsdale units by 
the mid-1970s had fallen into the hands of large development companies, which 
bought them as investments. Unable to sell the properties, the companies began 
renting them at relatively low rates to cut their losses. The combination of 
absentee landlords and revolving-door renters started a downward spiral, making 
it difficult for other owners to sell their properties when they wanted to 
move, leaving more renters, more absentee owners and more problems. 
</P>
<P>
 By the mid-1970s, fewer than a quarter of the units were owner-occupied, and 
one resident at that time told the Carson Planning Commission that by his 
estimate 100 of the units were vacant. Prices fell, rents dropped and crime 
rose as it did almost everywhere during the period. 
</P>
<P>
 The homeowners' board of governors, torn by factions and dissent, was unable 
or unwilling to do anything, residents said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Scottsdale's chronic problems stemmed from one of the ideals of the 
original condominium plan: the concept of pooling monthly fees from homeowners 
and using the money for common needs such as maintenance and repairs. The 
problem was, some homeowners paid and others didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been times that at least 150 or more (homeowners) were not 
paying," said Barbara Volpe of Rinebol & Co., which managed the development 
from 1988 to 1990 and recently resumed overseeing the facility. "I know that at 
one time the delinquencies there were over $300,000." 
</P>
<P>
 Without the money, things that desperately had to be done didn't get done. The 
swimming pool fell into disrepair. Roofs started leaking and couldn't be fixed. 
Population rose to more than 4,000 as families shared condominiums or rented 
their garages. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, crime within the development soared. 
</P>
<P>
 Although sheriff's deputies do not keep records of crimes in Scottsdale alone, 
they say they had frequently responded to reports of drug dealing, shootings, 
thefts and other crimes there. The complex developed a reputation as one of the 
most dangerous places in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the same elements that made Scottsdale unique also made trouble for 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department. The guard gate, for example, meant 
that deputies had only one way into and out of the complex. Criminals escaped 
down the walkways between townhomes and jumped over the low exterior wall 
before patrol cars could drive around the circular main road to reach a crime 
scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies say that it became standard procedure to dispatch units 
into the complex in pairs after dark. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a favorable policing layout," Kaono said. "It was just not safe 
for anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1980s, some residents looked outside the complex for help. In an 
anonymous letter to authorities, they begged for help solving their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decent homeowners who want to keep their homes and better the complex 
have their lives in danger due to murders, shootings and drug dealing," they 
wrote in a letter signed Group of Concerned Homeowners Committee. "We need a 
new board of governors but have been unsuccessful in trying to vote out the 
same old members who have hung on for years." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials responded that it was an internal problem in the complex and 
they were unable to help. The problems continued. 
</P>
<P>
 "We stopped being the management company because of the danger," Volpe said. 
"A lot of it was drug dealing and prostitution, but there was gang activity 
also. . . . They had shootouts in that property from time to time. . . . I got 
shot at and my daughter's car got ripped off." 
</P>
<P>
 While residents coped with crime and decaying homes, too often the people they 
paid to protect them -- the private security guards who manned the gate and 
patrolled the complex -- weren't much help. 
</P>
<P>
 Security guards had long been a fixture at Scottsdale. In the past two 
decades, at least 14 security companies have worked at the complex. Some 
residents complained that the guards, some of whom were authorized to carry 
firearms, enforced parking and other regulations against some residents and not 
against others. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, there were allegations by residents and others that some security 
guards were involved in drug dealing at the complex. Those allegations, 
however, were never proven. 
</P>
<P>
 To many people, Scottsdale seemed like a hopeless case. And then two years 
ago, a group of residents decided they had had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Gomez, 49, might seem an unlikely community activist. The mother of 
eight children and grandmother to 16, she got married when she was 14 years old 
in Mexico and has been a housewife ever since. She has been a Scottsdale 
resident for 19 years but had never been involved in the community until two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Outraged over the state of affairs in Scottsdale, and angry at a board of 
governors that she believed wasn't doing enough to address the community's 
problems, Gomez and a handful of allies gathered proxy votes from 265 
homeowners and took control of the board, appointing 12 of the 15 members. The 
new group started making changes immediately. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they fired the security guard company and brought in McRoberts 
Protective Agency, Inc., a 118-year-old nationwide security firm with a 
reputation for honest, efficient service. In an effort to deal with crime and 
drug dealing, McRoberts, backed by the board of governors, began enforcing 
parking regulations and ridding the complex of abandoned cars. The new security 
guards also started rigidly enforcing access regulations that limit entry to 
residents and their guests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was havoc at first," says Bradley Young, a former Torrance police officer 
who is a regional manager for McRoberts. "But eventually, the residents 
understood that it was for their protection." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Young says his company required the 13 security officers assigned to 
Scottsdale -- who unlike some previous security guards wear 
professional-looking uniforms -- to undergo diversity training so they could 
better understand and work with residents of the ethnically and racially mixed 
community. Guards also have gone on ride-alongs with sheriff's deputies to 
improve communication. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials say gang activity has decreased dramatically, and there 
has not been a shooting at the complex in a year. Unlike a few years ago, crime 
at Scottsdale, they say, is no higher than the surrounding area of south 
Carson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want something like community-based policing here," Young said. "We want 
the security officers to know the residents and the residents to know them. 
There are a lot of good people here, and only a few bad ones. If we work 
together, the good people will help us drive out the bad ones." 
</P>
<P>
 The new board also started trying to get Scottsdale's management and financial 
houses in order. They brought back Volpe and Rinebol & Co. to manage the 
property, where units rent for $750 to $1,000 a month, and reinstated Nicolas 
Meza, a property manager who had been fired by an earlier board. They started 
trying to collect delinquent monthly fees from homeowners, working out payment 
plans for those who couldn't afford it. 
</P>
<P>
 The new board, which oversees a budget of more than $1 million a year in 
homeowner fees, also is trying to get a loan from the city for a $6.5-million 
improvement "wish list," which includes not only roof repairs but fixing the 
swimming pool, renovating the park and raising by several feet the wall that 
surrounds the complex to deter crime and drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's redevelopment agency could loan Scottsdale's homeowners enough 
money to make the desired repairs, but only on certain conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be some accounting," said Adolfo Reyes, who heads the agency. 
"If (they) give us a plan of reorganization that is satisfactory, then we would 
propose it for consideration by the agency." 
</P>
<P>
 Gomez says Scottsdale really needs the help. "Here we are humble people with 
many children, and we can't do it all alone," she said. "In 30 years the roofs 
have never been changed. That needs to be done, and the park is necessary. The 
children here have nothing, nowhere to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Crime and drugs are still problems, sheriff's officials said. And there are 
still tensions between factions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, the board was mostly black-controlled," said Wayne Spencer of Asgard 
Security, which at one time provided security for the development. "Back then, 
the Hispanics felt slighted. Now the shoe is on the other foot. The Hispanics 
are mostly in control, and some of the blacks feel slighted. There's a lot of 
politics." 
</P>
<P>
 (Nearly half of Scottsdale's residents are Latino, according to the management 
company, and African Americans constitute about 25% of the residents; the 
remainder are Asian or white. The estimated annual household income is $17,000, 
about half of the countywide average.) 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there is a sense that things are better than they used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can go out at night now, it's very pleasant," Gomez said, speaking in 
Spanish. "Yes, there still are problems, but not nearly as many as there were 
before. I've lived here for 19 years and this is so much better than just a few 
years ago."

SAN GABRIEL VALLEY / COVER STORY; DRAWING THE LINE BETWEEN LOVE AND ABUSE; 
ASIAN IMMIGRANTS FIND THAT DISCIPLINARY METHODS SEEN AS RESPONSIBLE PARENTING 
IN THEIR NATIVE COUNTRIES CAN BE CONSIDERED IMPROPER IN U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The boy had bruises on his arms and legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Purple blotches tracked along his limbs, as though someone had beaten the 
skinny 8-year-old Vietnamese boy with a belt. 
</P>
<P>
 When social worker Dat Nguyen knocked at the run-down El Monte apartment, the 
boy's parents readily admitted they had hit their son. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a bad boy, the mother said. He fought with schoolchildren who made fun 
of his shabby clothes and poor English. The teacher even sent a note home about 
this misbehavior, which 
</P>
<P>
 brought much shame to the family. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents, who immigrated from Vietnam in 1993, were dumbfounded to learn 
they were under investigation for child abuse. They listened as Nguyen 
struggled to explain terms like "excessive discipline" and "foster home" -- 
words that have no equivalents in many Asian societies where extended families 
raise children and government interference is unheard of. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love our children, and we suffer with them when we discipline them, but we 
feel that hitting is OK," recalled the father, a former colonel in the South 
Vietnamese army who spent nine years in Communist re-education camps. "I have a 
responsibility to do this, so they will grow up to become good American 
citizens." 
</P>
<P>
 Corporal punishment is accepted discipline in many Asian cultures, but the 
practice is bringing trouble to some immigrants who find that what is 
considered responsible parenting in their native countries can be seen as abuse 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Vietnam and China . . . it's a normal practice to hit a child with a whip 
for bringing home a B," said Frank Nguyen, no relation to Dat, who heads the 
Asian-Pacific Unit of the Los Angeles County Department of Children's Services. 
</P>
<P>
 In Korean, the word teaching, gyopyon , means "teaching with a cane." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that abuse among the Asian community is a massive problem. While 
Asian Americans make up about 11% of the population in Los Angeles County, they 
accounted for only 1.8%, or 1,036 of the 59,414 cases of child abuse and 
neglect investigated in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But some experts believe the number of abuse cases is under-reported. 
</P>
<P>
 In a study of the issue, titled "Cultural Issues in the Prevention and 
Treatment of Child Abuse and Neglect," Frank Nguyen suggests that family 
loyalty and filial piety keep figures low. Also, Asian culture generally calls 
for resolving family problems internally. 
</P>
<P>
 But the issue is not one of high statistics; it's more one of different 
cultural outlooks, which raise provocative questions about the nature of 
discipline, parental authority and the need to protect children while observing 
sensitivity to other cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 When social workers call on these families, they often find concerned and 
loving parents -- not dysfunctional abusers. It's just that these families are 
used to handling things differently in their homelands. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to be very, very sensitive to this issue, because what we think of as 
discipline could be definitely considered abuse in L.A.," said Sookkyung Chang, 
a clinical psychologist who works with Korean families in Rowland Heights and 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our history, if a child does something wrong, the mother will go get tree 
branches and administer 10 lashes on the calves. But she hasn't lost control. 
She's doing it as a punishment and everyone knows. In America, it's a totally 
different culture." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who work with Asian immigrant families say it's not always clear when 
physical punishment crosses over into child abuse. Often, it depends on one's 
cultural perspective. And therein lies trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are real abuses out there, but there are also a lot of cultural 
misunderstandings," Nguyen said. "To stop using a stick is easy, but what's the 
alternative? They're scared to death they're going to lose control of their 
children. They're scared to death that the police will intervene and come take 
their kid into protective custody." 
</P>
<P>
 To address this cultural confusion, the Asian Youth Center and the Asian 
Pacific Family Center, both in Rosemead, now offer parenting classes in 
Cantonese, Vietnamese, Mandarin and Korean. Private psychologists of Asian 
heritage do a brisk business bridging the gap between conservative Old-World 
parents and rebellious Americanized teens. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, the Department of Children's Services tripled its Asian-Pacific unit, 
based in Covina, from 8 to 24 social workers of Vietnamese, Korean, Laotian, 
Fukien, Cantonese, Samoan and Mandarin heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 With shared roots and a common language, these social workers have more chance 
for success. Aware that direct confrontation is considered rude, they break the 
ice with small talk about their common homeland. So that parents don't lose 
face in front of their children, they ask them to step into another room before 
explaining the purpose of their visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the issue is easily resolved, a clear-cut cultural misunderstanding 
such as the Southeast Asian practice of coining -- or rubbing a child's back 
with a heated coin -- a common folk remedy for respiratory illness. Coining 
leaves welts that look suspiciously like abuse to teachers unfamiliar with this 
treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Spankings or beatings put social workers on more murky ground. Under 
California's broadly worded child protection laws, only simple spanking is 
allowed; the use of a belt or a slap to the face, under certain circumstances, 
can be grounds for court intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's Services discourages all spanking. Instead, social workers urge 
parents to set limits and use grounding or loss of privilege as discipline. But 
it can be a hard sell. 
</P>
<P>
 In one case, Nguyen said a physical education teacher called the child abuse 
hot line after noticing marks on a boy's legs in the shower. When social 
workers arrived at the house, the boy's father threw his hands up and said: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I give up, it's too complicated here in America. If you don't want me to 
educate my child, what can I do? You can take the child away." 
</P>
<P>
 After long talks with the parents of the 8-year-old Vietnamese boy in El 
Monte, Nguyen determined that the boy was not in danger because the family was 
willing to take Nguyen's advice as a Vietnamese elder and try alternate forms 
of discipline. 
</P>
<P>
 So one summer afternoon, as the boy crawled happily into his father's lap, 
Nguyen explained the concept of "time out," in which a child is sent off to a 
quiet place to reflect on his misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, social workers provide one-on-one counseling or recommend 
parenting classes that will teach American ways of dealing with children and 
adolescents. In more severe cases, parents are sentenced to attend such classes 
by a dependency court judge as a prerequisite to getting their children back. 
</P>
<P>
 If all else fails -- as with 50 cases last year -- they go to court and ask a 
judge to find the child another home. 
</P>
<P>
 That was what happened to a 16-year-old Lao-Cambodian girl whose farming 
family fled the killing fields of Pol Pot's Cambodia for a refugee camp in 
Thailand, where she was born. After several years they were resettled in Long 
Beach, where the family had relatives, but the girl grew up speaking fluent 
English and estranged from her traditional Southeast Asian roots. 
</P>
<P>
 At age 12, her father discovered she had a boyfriend and was ditching school 
and hit her with a steel pipe. She ran screaming to her church, which called 
the child abuse hot line. After intensive interviews with the family, Laotian 
American social worker Paul Che decided the girl would be safer elsewhere; her 
grandparents agreed to take her in. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now 16, the girl speaks with deep sorrow about the cultural chasm that led to 
the estrangement from her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted me to come home right after school. They wouldn't let me go out. 
They'd say, 'Why do you bring shame to the family and disrespect your parents?' 
" she recalls. "I know they love me, but you shouldn't show your love by 
abusing, because if you hit your kids, it's going to encourage them not to 
listen." 
</P>
<P>
 But not all parents agree. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason the U.S. has so many juvenile delinquents is because the schools 
are lax and most parents don't use corporal punishment," maintains the 
Vietnamese father in El Monte. "If you don't let us discipline our child now, 
who will take responsibility for him later?" 
</P>
<P>
 And some parents resent being forced to attend American-style parenting 
classes, according to Josh Lin, a psychologist at the Asian Pacific Family 
Clinic in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 "They feel mistreated by the system," Lin said. "They tell me that we need a 
law to protect parents, (that) when they attempt to control their kids, they 
end up in court. Then they tell me: 'Fine, take my child away from the home, I 
can't do anything with him, he won't listen to me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Asian immigrants tend to view adolescence differently from Americans. Teens -- 
especially girls -- are expected to come right home after school instead of 
hanging out with their friends. Parents feel they are losing control of teens 
who want to stay out late or wear makeup. Sometimes, they feel the only way to 
regain control is through hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents keep asking me, 'Why is the social worker interfering?' " said Marina 
Tse, a community activist who teaches in the Duarte Unified School District and 
is former president of the Chinese-American Education Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell them: 'It's to protect the child.' And the parent says, 'Protecting 
the child is my job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Used to minimal interaction with teachers, immigrants may also assume the 
worst if they receive a call from the school. Glenn Masuda, a psychologist who 
counsels troubled teens at the Asian Pacific Family Clinic, recalls a Taiwanese 
father entering a parent-teacher meeting with his son. As they walked into the 
classroom, the father cuffed his son repeatedly, figuring he had misbehaved. 
The teacher wanted to announce he had been named a National Merit Scholar 
finalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Nahmias, principal of the Grazide School in Hacienda Heights, where 
Asians make up 53% of the student body, said Asian parents often approach him 
at parent-teacher conferences and ask if they can spank with an open hand, or 
if they can use a belt or how many times they can hit. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a situation that makes Nahmias uncomfortable. He can only provide 
guidelines, not answers. But he feels for these families: "It's a real 
difficult situation for them, because they want to discipline their kids and 
teach them what's right but they don't know what's appropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Masuda said parents have asked him whether they should chain their rebellious 
teen-age daughters to their beds to keep them from going out. 
</P>
<P>
 "That happens more often than you'd think," Masuda said. "They say, 'Hey, my 
neighbor did it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On the flip side, some unscrupulous but savvy teens have gotten wise to the 
child abuse reporting law and now threaten to call the police and report 
beatings unless their parents allow them to do as they please. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have all the power," said Mai Ho, executive director of Asian 
Perinatal Advocates, a San Francisco parent-education agency. "They know the 
American laws, they speak English, and so the roles are reversed." 
</P>
<P>
 The need for education goes both ways. Earlier this year, the Chinese American 
Education Assn. co-sponsored a seminar so that mainly Caucasian teachers, 
counselors and administrators from San Gabriel Valley school districts could 
learn more about issues affecting Asian students, such as high parental 
expectations and cultural norms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Corporal punishment is part of parenting skills in Asian cultures, and we as 
educators need to distinguish which is legitimate punishment and which is real 
abuse," Loretta Huang, an educator in the Alhambra School District, told 
hundreds of San Gabriel Valley educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, the discipline debate comes at a time when some Americans are 
questioning their own methods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've become way too lenient, and I think the pendulum is starting to go 
back," said Joann Steinmeier, of the Arcadia Board of Education, where Asian 
Americans comprise 45% of the district's student body. "Most of the baby 
boomers don't spank their kids and they have no respect for authority, so 
what's the answer?"

THEATER REVIEW; CAST BRINGS A GOLDEN GLOW TO 'FINIAN'S RAINBOW'; THE STORY 
INVOLVING LEPRECHAUNS AND LOVE GETS CARRIED ALONG BY THE MEMORABLE AND WITTY 
SCORE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 You can count on the Camarillo Community Theatre for the consistently 
best-produced musicals in Ventura County. Though its budget may be less than 
those of larger companies and its facilities not as fancy, the Camarillo group 
shows imagination in its selection of material and talent in its presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Such is the case with its current presentation, the Irish-American fantasy 
"Finian's Rainbow." As the song says, it's something sort of grandish. 
</P>
<P>
 The musical, which debuted on Broadway in January, 1947, is set in Rainbow 
Valley, in the fictional state of Missitucky. A local senator is buying up all 
the cotton farmers' land, hoping to prevent something much like the Tennessee 
Valley Authority from moving in and industrializing the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Along come Finian McLonergan and his daughter, Sharon, newly arrived from 
Ireland and closely pursued by a leprechaun, Og. He's in pursuit of the pot of 
gold that Finian has stolen -- or borrowed, as Finian would have it -- from 
him. There's also a subplot stemming from the senator's racial prejudice and 
still-timely intolerance ("My whole family has been having trouble with 
immigrants," he exclaims, " . . . ever since they came to this country.") 
</P>
<P>
 There are a couple of romances, and everybody winds up happy at the end -- 
even the senator, who has learned his lesson. Songs including "That Old Devil 
Moon," "How Are Things in Glocca Morra" and "When I'm Not Near the Girl I Love" 
emerged as standards from the tuneful and frequently witty E.Y. Harburg-Burton 
Lane score. (Harburg also wrote the show's book, along with Fred Faidly). 
</P>
<P>
 At the reins are Linda Steigler as director and co-choreographer, musical 
director Diann Alexander, and co-choreographers Carol Gwynn Barnes and Debbie 
Probe -- who is seen as Susan the Silent, who communicates by dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Steigler has assembled a capable cast, including several faces familiar to 
local audiences and a number of newcomers. Kimberly and Mitchell Neill, wed in 
real life, here co-star as romantic leads Sharon and Woody, a Rainbow Valley 
townsman just returned from a broadening stint in the Merchant Marine. Lloyd 
Allen, memorable for his roles in this group's "1776" and "The Pirates of 
Penzance," plays the gentle, irascible Finian, and Wade Powers is seen as the 
sprightly (and somewhat oversized) sprite, Og. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the supporting cast are Richard Hawkes as the senator, Curtis Marsden as 
the sheriff, Bob Decker as the senator's aide (who has a wonderful couple of 
scenes with Steven Thrasher, in which the aide demonstrates how a black man 
should shuffle (like in "Gone With the Wind," he explains) in order to land a 
job as the senator's butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Of special note are a number of particularly capable young actors, and the 
participation of more African Americans than have been seen in any local 
production for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Camarillo group performs in an elderly high school auditorium at the 
Camarillo Airport, and sometimes the physical aspects of a production are a bit 
shaky. Here, the special effects fall so flat that you might not notice them at 
all, though Finian does get a presentable rainbow at the end. But in terms of 
talent, enthusiasm and overall good feeling, this show is a hard one to beat.

THEATER REVIEW; OSCAR WILDE'S WITTY DIALOGUE NOT DULLED BY TIME, TRANSLATION; 
SPANISH-LANGUAGE VERSION OF 'THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING EARNEST' MAINTAINS 
PLAYWRIGHT'S VERBAL RIPOSTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN LOEWENTHAL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1894, before the incisive quips of Oscar Levant, Groucho Marx, and the 
droll exchanges between P.G. Wodehouse's upper crust fop, Bertie Wooser and his 
noble archetypal butler, Jeeves, Irish playwright Oscar Wilde wrote his final 
and most popular play, "The Importance of Being Earnest." 
</P>
<P>
 And last weekend's performance of "La Importancia de Llamarse Ernesto," in 
Spanish by the Oxnard-based Teatro de las Americas proved that Wilde's genius 
and sparkling language is alive and well a century later in another language. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Christina Aerenlund's direction, the nine-member cast has successfully 
translated (in every sense) Wilde's witty dialogue from page to stage -- no 
mean feat considering the basis of his comedy is pithy repartee and sententious 
badinage concerning human nature and society. 
</P>
<P>
 Only minor adjustments in body language, names and topical allusions have been 
made to make the play more accessible to a Latino audience. And 
Spanish-speakers should have no trouble enjoying Wilde's verbal ripostes 
realized in this well-executed production where elocution and enunciation are 
crucial to "apreciar al meollo" (savor to the marrow) the author's humor. 
</P>
<P>
 The action still takes place in Algernon's salon and later at Ernest/Jack's 
country house, although the place is now turn-of-the century Mexico rather than 
England. And topical references have been adjusted. The comedy's plot revolves 
around misunderstanding and an absurd preference for appearances rather than 
substance. But Wilde does not depend on frenetic farcical confusion. Instead, 
the play and this production is well-paced to permit the audience to savor 
every syllable of the frothy nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Wilde's aesthetics, often the aim of a work of art is decorative 
-- the subject matter irrelevant -- and the works' intention is to evoke 
pleasure in the perceiver. Despite budgetary constraints, the cast has created 
a set that effectively evokes the period. And the colorful wardrobe supplied by 
Chameleon Costumes of Ventura is a visual delight. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Clayton (Ernest/Jack) and Armando Ramirez (Algernon) are perfectly cast 
as incipient dandies. Pat Casiano is a fine Gwendolyn. Lourdes Solorzano plays 
the ingenue, Cecilia, with depth. Irma Stewart's governess Senora Prisma is an 
entertaining foil to the clergyman, Casulla, creditably portrayed by newcomer 
Richard Harnden. Pouring tea with aplomb are butlers, Salvador Sandoval and 
Rigoberto Guizar. And Margarita Cortese is a scene-stealer as the matronly Dona 
Agustina. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Aerenlund's wise decision to combine Acts II and III, the production 
including intermission runs over 2 1/2 enjoyable hours. And though it is 
suitable for the family, the urbane dialogue, intrigue, static action and 
length might not hold the attention of the preteen set. 
</P>
<P>
 But this production is a laudable effort and worthy of community support. 
Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: "La Importancia de Llamarse Ernesto," the Spanish-language version of 
Oscar Wilde's classic comedy, "The Importance of Being Earnest." 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Friday and Saturday at 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Plaza Players Theatre, 34 N. Palm St., Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 * HOW MUCH: $7 for adults, $5 for students. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Tickets will also be available at the door 30 minutes before curtain.

PLAN TO ANNEX LAND MAY BE PUT ON BALLOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Protesters could force a public vote on Gardena's plans to annex an adjacent 
neighborhood of 850 homes on unincorporated county land. 
</P>
<P>
 During a heated public hearing Tuesday night, the City Council heard testimony 
for and against the proposal, which would affect 164.5 acres near El Camino 
College.More than 100 people attended. 
</P>
<P>
 A group of county residents first approached the city with the proposal in 
March, 1993. They argued that by joining Gardena, they would have access to 
improved services, such as faster response from police and fire departments. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents who opposed the annexation gathered 462 signatures on a petition 
to stop it. The petition was presented to council Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents have questioned the validity of the petition, saying signers were 
misled. And a postcard campaign alerted residents that they could withdraw 
their names. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk May Y. Doi will count and verify any withdrawals and the remaining 
signatures on the petition. The results will be announced at the council's Oct. 
11 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 If at least 50% of registered county residents in the area are found to have 
signed the petition, the proposal is killed. If fewer than 25% have signed, the 
annexation will go ahead as planned. 
</P>
<P>
 But if between 25% and 50% of the county residents have signed the petition, a 
vote will be held.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: A DIRECT HIT BY AN EX-ARMY COOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL KRIKORIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 15, William Young got a job washing dishes at a Long Island restaurant. A 
year later, he was in charge of the kitchen. Over the next 16 years he bounced 
around a lot -- Army cook in Germany and France, cook/bartender/bouncer (Young 
could bench-press 500 pounds) in Long Island, head chef at a home for 600 
disabled adults and children. Now he's chef at Califia, which has been one of 
the best-kept secrets in the South Bay. Hidden in the bottom floor of the 
Radisson Plaza Hotel in Manhattan Beach, Califia is an elegant two-level room 
with oil paintings, comfortably large booths and tables in shades of brown and 
green. The polished service is overseen by maitre d' Sandy Girvin, himself a 
graduate of the Culinary Institute of America. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin, there's an unusual appetizer of blackened loin of lamb with rosemary 
on corn bread croutons with jalapeno relish ($8) or angel hair pasta with 
smoked scallops, prawns, sun-dried tomatoes and morels ($7.50). 
</P>
<P>
 Salads include Kentucky limestone lettuce with a basil and anchovy vinaigrette 
($5) and a salad of grilled breast of duck, goat cheese and mixed greens in 
raspberry vinaigrette. 
</P>
<P>
 For a main dish, the menu's biggest seller is the full rack of lamb roasted 
with Dijon mustard and herbed bread crumbs served with a rosemary mint glaze 
($26). Grilled, butterflied filet mignon is stuffed with wild boar sausage with 
roasted shallot and Merlot wine sauce ($26). 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch, Califia offers two tasty soups: a rich lobster bisque with a flaky 
puff pastry topping ($5.50) or the puree of artichoke and spinach with sour 
cream and chives ($4). 
</P>
<P>
 Califia is at 1400 Parkview Ave., Manhattan Beach. (310) 546-7511. Open 
Tuesday through Friday from 11:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Tuesday through Saturday 
from 6 to 10 p.m.

 ARMED, DANGEROUS 
</P>
<P>
 The recruiting interest in El Camino College quarterback Steve Sarkisian 
figures to increase after he opened the season by passing for 433 yards and 
five touchdowns Saturday night in a 55-28 victory over Rancho Santiago. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really going to pick up now," Warrior Coach John Featherstone said. "We 
had two different scouting services film Saturday's game." 
</P>
<P>
 Brigham Young and Fresno State have expressed the most interest in Sarkisian, 
a sophomore from West Torrance High. He passed for 2,970 yards and 21 
touchdowns last season, but his numbers were overshadowed by El Camino's 
defensive breakdowns in a 2-8 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Surrounded by a stronger team, Sarkisian threatened to break the school 
single-game passing record Saturday. He sat out most of the fourth quarter, 
which probably prevented him from eclipsing the record of 467 yards set by 
Ronnie Barber in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't like to run up scores," said Featherstone, who was informed that 
Sarkisian was close to the record after the quarterback had sat out two series. 
"I asked Steve if he wanted to go back in, but he didn't care (about the 
record) at all. He just wanted to win the game. That's the kind of guy he is." 
</P>
<P>
 So, where does Sarkisian rank with the other quarterbacks Featherstone has 
coached? 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably our top two guys were Dan Speltz in '87 and Frank Dolce in '89. They 
were fabulous players," Featherstone said. "I feel comfortable saying 
(Sarkisian) could become the best quarterback we've had here. 
</P>
<P>
 "Speltz won us a national championship. Dolce got us in a national 
championship game. That's Steve's goal." STRONG START 
</P>
<P>
 For openers, Saturday's game was all Featherstone could have hoped for. El 
Camino punted only once and gained 609 total yards, and the defense was much 
improved over last season, holding Rancho Santiago to 97 yards passing. 
</P>
<P>
 The one area of concern when practice started was the secondary, but the 
recent addition of Omarr Morgan has helped shore up the team's pass defense. 
Morgan, The Times' 1993 South Bay Back of the Year at Hawthorne High, joined 
the Warriors a week into practice after leaving San Jose State and quickly 
worked his way into a starting cornerback spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a Pac-10 defensive back," Featherstone said. 
</P>
<P>
 El Camino will take this week off before resuming play with road games against 
Fullerton on Sept. 24 and Golden West on Oct. 1. INJURED COLT 
</P>
<P>
 Carson High lost more than a football game last week against Bishop Amat. 
Quarterback Ramon Rogers suffered bruised kidneys in the 34-7 defeat and will 
be sidelined for a couple of weeks, Athletic Director Saul Pacheco said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Sharif Paxton will start in Rogers' place Friday night against San 
Diego Morse (0-0-1) at Harbor College. Paxton, a national age-group 
record-holder in the 110-meter high hurdles, is regarded as one of the best 
athletes in the Carson program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't hesitate to play him," Coach David Williams said before the 
season. VICTORY, AT LAST 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps no one was more relieved than Coach Donald Threatt when Gardena High 
snapped an 18-game losing streak Friday by beating Hamilton, 19-0, in a season 
opener. Threatt had suffered through an 0-10 record in his first season as the 
Mohicans' coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very rewarding and very pleasing to have the players enjoy some 
success," he said. "This is what we had hoped to be last season. We were very 
disappointed we couldn't play any better." 
</P>
<P>
 Threatt said the biggest improvement has been in the players' attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we had some kids who were very self-centered," he said. "Now we've 
got a group of kids who have been trying real hard since last January. We have 
some ability, but not a lot of size or depth." 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Greg Pettis, who missed most of last season because of a broken 
finger, passed for 200 yards and two touchdowns against Hamilton, the school 
where Threatt had previously coached. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mohicans will try to make it two in row when they play host to Bishop 
Montgomery (0-1) Friday night. FOREVER YOUNG 
</P>
<P>
 San Pedro High coaches know they have a promising quarterback in Melvin 
Yarborough. They're just not sure what grade he's in. 
</P>
<P>
 Pirate Coach Mike Walsh said Tuesday that Yarborough, thought to be a 
sophomore, might, in fact, be a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Credit-wise, he's a ninth-grader," Walsh said. "He didn't enter the ninth 
grade until last February. He went from regular school to a continuation school 
for half a year, then to us. Technically, he still has 3 1/2 years of 
eligibility remaining." 
</P>
<P>
 That's bad news for San Pedro's opponents. In his varsity debut Friday, 
Yarborough, 15, showed remarkable poise while passing for 154 yards and two 
touchdowns in a 25-14 loss to Hawthorne. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's great," Hawthorne Coach Dan Robbins said. "He's really going to be 
something. He took on what I consider the best defensive line in the South Bay 
area without getting flustered in the least." TON OF TRADITION 
</P>
<P>
 Robbins, in his fourth season as Hawthorne's coach, always seems to find a 
talented behemoth to play right offensive tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, it was 6-foot-6, 275-pound Jesse Herrera. In 1992, it was 6-5, 
270-pound Mostafa Sobhi. Last season, it was 6-7, 300-pound David Camacho. All 
three were named to The Times' South Bay All-Star first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Carrying on the tradition is Charles Allen, a 6-7, 285-pound senior who played 
tight end last season. Robbins said Allen played well against San Pedro despite 
lacking experience at tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Little things need to be improved, but I'd give him a solid B in terms of a 
grade," Robbins said. "He's really strong and his size isn't deceiving. He's 
getting tougher and tougher." DISPUTED TOUCHDOWN 
</P>
<P>
 Serra Coach Charles Nash, upon reviewing game films, said Montclair Prep's 
winning touchdown with no time remaining Friday should have been nullified 
because a forward lateral occurred on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Montclair Prep defeated the Cavaliers, 12-6, when Darrell Dent returned a 
blocked field goal 65 yards on the game's last play. Nash said after Michael 
Wiley's 37-yard field goal attempt was blocked by a lineman, the ball was 
picked up by another Montclair Prep player, who pitched the ball to Dent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was definitely a forward lateral," Nash said. "But the officials are 
human. I asked one of the officials about the play (after the game). He said it 
wasn't his call. He said, 'Coach, it's not my call, but from where I was 
standing, it appeared to me it was a forward lateral.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nash, though, said Serra should have never been in a position where it needed 
a last-second field goal to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had more (scoring) opportunities inside the red zone than they did," Nash 
said. "We just sputtered offensively." 
</P>
<P>
 Nash lauded the work of new defensive coordinator Steve Garcia, previously a 
coach at Bishop Montgomery. Serra, led by Wiley's 17 tackles at linebacker, 
shut down Montclair Prep after losing to the Mounties, 40-6, last season. 
RISING STAR 
</P>
<P>
 Based on talent, Brice Montgomery would be starting for Serra's varsity 
football team this season. But because he's only 14, the touted freshman will 
have to be content with playing against junior varsity competition. 
</P>
<P>
 That matchup proved a lopsided one last week, as Montgomery scored four 
touchdowns -- three on punt returns -- in Serra's runaway victory over 
Montclair Prep. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's probably our best cornerback, but he's not old enough to play on the 
varsity," Nash said. "He could be my starting tailback and cornerback as a 
sophomore. He would start at cornerback right now, that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Nash said the 5-8, 150-pound Montgomery, the holder of several national 
age-group sprint records in track, was the subject of a fierce recruiting 
battle between several high schools, with Serra beating out Bishop Amat and 
Loyola. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were blessed," Nash said. "I now know that prayers do work." 
</P>
<P>
 However, not everyone at Serra was thrilled with Montgomery's four-TD 
performance last week. By running back three punts for scores, he managed to 
keep the offense on the bench longer than it wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids have been telling me, 'You have to take (Montgomery) off special teams 
because we never get a chance to play,' " Nash said. LIONS' DEN

 Coming off a strong tournament performance, the Loyola Marymount women's 
volleyball team will play host to its own tournament this weekend -- the 
LMU/Red Lion Hotel Conference Challenge at Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 The event matches Loyola and Pepperdine from the West Coast Conference against 
Colorado State and San Diego State of the Western Athletic Conference. Friday, 
Loyola plays San Diego State at 5 p.m. and Pepperdine meets Colorado State at 
7:30. Saturday, Pepperdine and San Diego State meet at 5 and Loyola plays 
Colorado State at 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (3-3) placed second at the prestigious UC Santa Barbara Volleyball 
Classic last weekend. The highlight came in the semifinals, where the Lions 
upset eighth-ranked and defending national champion Long Beach State, 15-7, 
15-12, 15-8. It was Long Beach State's first three-game loss since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola lost to 11-ranked UC Santa Barbara, 15-9, 15-13, 15-6, in the final. 
Lion middle blocker Mardell Wrensch was named to the all-tournament team, the 
fourth time the junior has been all-tournament in her collegiate career.

 Hagan Kelley, a sophomore at South Torrance High, won the junior division 
title at the Rusty/Newport Beach pro-am surf contest last weekend. He received

Monday for Hawaii to begin a national ad campaign for Kellogg's cereal. . . .

PUBLIC SERVICE: CHARGES OF GENDER BIAS AGAINST PASADENA'S CITY ATTORNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victor Kaleta, who was forced into retirement from his post as city attorney 
of Pasadena, called me to inform me (as president of the National Institute of 
Municipal Law Officers, i.e. city attorneys) of his current situation. I am 
astounded! 
</P>
<P>
 I have known Vic Kaleta for nine years. He is a gentleman of prudence, 
fortitude, temperance and absolute competence. As a longtime member of the 
board of directors of our group, Mr. Kaleta has championed every feminist cause 
to come before us. For Mr. Kaleta to be guilty of gender bias is so out of 
character for him that it is simply not believable. 
</P>
<P>
 The good people of Pasadena are like all fair-minded Americans and won't be 
fooled for long. There must be a special punishment awaiting those who would 
gratuitously trash a man's good name and public reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that I live on the opposite coast, I doubt I will ever meet any of Vic's 
vilifiers, which is just fine by me.

ENVIRONMENT: OK FOR SANDSTONE CANYON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I read with dismay the article indicating the approval of the development of 
Sandstone Canyon (July 21). Southern California is so difficult to survive in, 
at best, and to realize that sooner than later there will be nothing left of 
natural beauty or wildness to retreat to from the asphalt, fumes and traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 My suggestion is that all stories of development be placed on the obituary 
page, to show the true nature of this continued destruction of trees and 
wildlife.

LIBRARIES: CREATING BENEFIT ASSESSMENT DISTRICTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Right now, cities all over the state are debating the establishment of benefit 
assessment districts for county libraries. It would drop yet another tax on 
property owners that we can neither afford nor should we be obligated to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the problem isn't that the county government needs more money to keep 
libraries open; the problem is that our illustrious county supervisors have 
their spending priorities skewed. They are more concerned with vote-buying 
entitlement programs and spiking their own pensions than keeping vital 
government services open. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, I pay my taxes for police and fire protection, education, 
transportation (road repair and construction) and libraries. Anything left over 
can be used to help the poor, infirm or mentally ill, but when the money is 
gone, that's it! 
</P>
<P>
 Making vital government services, like law enforcement, hostage to a half-cent 
sales tax or libraries to a benefit assessment district is a crime in itself.  
</P>
<P>
 Even more important than the $28.50 a year that this district will take 
initially (I say initially because once a benefit assessment district is 
established, the fee can be raised whenever the district deems necessary), it 
sets the precedent for additional districts for other vital services.

REEL LIFE; BOMBAY BLOCKBUSTERS ARRIVE WITH SOME LONG STORIES TO TELL; POPULAR 
INDIAN FILMS ARE BIG ON LOVE, MUSIC AND THE AMOUNT OF TIME IT TAKES TO VIEW 
THEM, AS A VISIT TO A SIMI VALLEY VIDEO STORE ATTESTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PANCHO DOLL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just about every story on the film industry of India starts with the 
observation that India produces more films each year than any other country, 
including the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Fascinating though it may be, we won't repeat the fact yet again. We won't 
repeat it because it's self-evident after one visit to the India Movie Land 
video store in Simi Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 titles line the shelves of the recently opened store. Owner 
Neeraj Newton said that represents roughly how many films his native country 
produces each year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of them have English subtitles," Newton said, "but that's very rare. 
Most are in Hindi." 
</P>
<P>
 Popular Indian films are star-driven, usually about romance, often musical and 
always long. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shortest I ever saw was exactly three hours," Newton said. "Some are 4 
1/2 hours or more." 
</P>
<P>
 If you think that's a marathon, Newton said some dramatizations of classical 
Indian epics consume 20 to 25 tapes, each lasting three or more hours. The 
cinema is, after all, an escape in a country where many live under harsh 
economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing the theater experience in India, Newton uses one word: "Crowded." 
</P>
<P>
 Indians have bought more than a half-billion movie tickets since 1975 and 
that's just for one film, "Sholay," an Indian takeoff on "The Magnificent 
Seven." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Americans know Indian cinema from director Satyajit Ray's small, moody 
films like the 1956 "Pather Panchali," which is also known as "Song of the 
Road," or the work of Mira Nair ("Salaam Bombay!" and "Mississippi Masala"). 
</P>
<P>
 Popular Indian films are somewhat prudish. The nation that gave us the Kama 
Sutra doesn't permit nudity in its films. However rape scenes are almost de 
rigueur.  
</P>
<P>
 Bikram Singh, a prominent movie critic, described a typical rape scene this 
way to the New York Times: 
</P>
<P>
 "The actress is disrobed or stripped as she is chased from room to room by the 
villain. Actual sex or full nudity is never shown but the audience knows what 
is going on, with screams from the woman and the camera focusing on torn bits 
of dress and leering thugs." 
</P>
<P>
 There are even character actors who specialize in rape. One known as Ranjeet, 
said that in his countless films he has raped virtually every major actress in 
the Hindi-language film industry. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same article the the New York Times reported that women's groups are 
having more success in protesting such portrayals.

NEIGHBORHOOD EATERY: LOS JARRITOS PUTS ON ITS SUNDAY BEST -- BARBACOA  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miguel Lopez left his native town of Puebla, Mexico, more than 20 years ago, 
but he never lost his taste for good barbacoa -- the Mexican pit barbecue that 
leaves meat savory and almost flaking off the bone. 
</P>
<P>
 So Lopez built a barbecue in the back yard of his home and began cooking for 
family and friends, wrapping a lamb or goat in agave leaves and roasting it 
slowly for hours in the pit. Now he also serves barbacoa every Sunday at Los 
Jarritos, the Pomona restaurant he manages on Towne Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The standing-room-only crowd comes from miles away to feast on the succulent 
barbecued meats and other Mexican specialties, including carne asada, huevos 
rancheros , machaca (shredded beef) and menudo (tripe soup). 
</P>
<P>
 But the main attraction remains the barbacoa.  
</P>
<P>
 "On Sunday, people ask for something special, something different, and this is 
a family tradition," says Lopez, who wears a gold chain with an emblem that 
reads "Los Jarritos 1." "Even people who move away, they still come back to 
Pomona on Sunday for my barbacoa. " 
</P>
<P>
 He isn't kidding. On a recent sweltering Sunday morning, Los Jarritos was 
packed with patrons waiting for tables to open. In the jammed parking lot, a 
vendor was taking advantage of the crowds by setting up displays of audio 
cassettes for sale : nortena music from Los Tigres de Norte to Pedro Infante. 
</P>
<P>
 Tacked on the restaurant door was a hand-lettered sign: " Barbacoa estilo 
Texcoco hoy ," it read, announcing to patrons that the barbecue served here is 
in the style of Texcoco, a neighborhood in Mexico City. Inside, waiters 
scurried around, bringing plates of steaming barbacoa and Penafiel, the Mexican 
soft drink that comes in flavors like tamarind and sangria. 
</P>
<P>
 It's clearly an informal, Formica-and-linoleum place where families bring both 
the kids and grandma. The patrons range from a young man wearing a revealing 
tank top to an 84-year-old woman wrapped in a shawl, despite the heat. 
</P>
<P>
 At Los Jarritos, each order comes with rice, beans, salad, a dollop of 
guacamole, tortillas, a freshly chopped salsa of tomatoes, chiles and cilantro, 
and a greasy soup that is heavy on salt and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions are hearty. Patrons can sprinkle on condiments ranging from a smoky 
red chile sauce to dried oregano, lemons and chopped onions. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices range from $1.05 for a soft taco to $7.80 for a combination plate. The 
barbacoa special is $6.95. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Jarritos also sells barbacoa to go, $10 a pound. The restaurant closes at 
5 p.m. on Sunday, but the barbacoa usually runs out long before then. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Jarritos is at 246 S. Towne Ave. in Pomona. Phone is (909) 623-3888. Los 
Jarritos 2, which doesn't serve barbacoa specials, is at 3191 N. Garey Avenue 
in Pomona.

Murders," due out in October.

EARTHWATCH: NEW OPPORTUNITIES CAN HELP YOU RECYCLE YOUR JOB INTO AN 
'ECO-CAREER'; A SEMINAR AT UCSB WILL OFFER A GUIDE TO PREPARING FOR 
ENVIRONMENTAL TRADES OF THE FUTURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 The rest and recreation of the Labor Day holiday have faded to a mere memory. 
We're back at work -- if we have work. If not, it's time to get work. Or, if 
we've got a job we don't like, it may be time to think about a change. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthwatch has been keeping an eye on the environmental job market on behalf 
of readers who might be interested in a related career. The conventional wisdom 
now is that we'll have five or six careers in our lifetime, whether we want to 
or not. 
</P>
<P>
 As for environmental work, the U.S. Department of Labor reports in the latest 
edition of its annual Occupational Outlook Handbook: ". . . these jobs are 
expected to increase faster than the average for all occupations in the U.S. 
until the year 2005." 
</P>
<P>
 This Saturday, well in time to beat the millennial rush, Ventura career 
counselor Margi Mainquist is moderating an all-day UC Santa Barbara Extension 
seminar on the theme, "Changing Workplaces, Jobs and Lives." This annual, free 
public-service event is held at the university's Campbell Hall. It is one of 
several extension programs that should interest folks who are thinking about 
"eco-careers." 
</P>
<P>
 The focus of Saturday's gathering is the nuts and bolts of recycling yourself. 
Mainquist characterizes the seminar as "charting a career path change." She 
will urge attendees to "stop watching TV and start reading books which are 
future oriented." 
</P>
<P>
 They'll discover, among other things she plans to point out, that "biology is 
where the breakthroughs are coming." That covers a multitude of trades -- from 
health services to space science to environmental remediation. For instance, 
one of Saturday's speakers will be the environmental and health safety officer 
for Raytheon, Barry Pabst Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 For specific, locally based, environmental career training, the UCSB Ventura 
Center is offering a certification program this fall in hazardous materials 
management, conducted by Ventura attorney Janet Dillon. The extension also 
offers certificate programs in air quality management as well as land-use and 
environmental planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are jobs that are not going to disappear," says Dillon, adding with a 
touch of diligence, "although some hiring is in a holding pattern because of 
the economy." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, according to the current issue of the Ventura-based 
California Planning & Development Report: " . . . waste management facilities 
(may be) the state's only growth industry." 
</P>
<P>
 The "eco-professions" have reached sufficient status in the eyes of the 
regents of the University of California that they have authorized the 
establishment of a whole new School of Environmental Science and Management -- 
to be located on the UCSB campus. 
</P>
<P>
 With the avowed purpose of training folks for the new jobs opening up, the 
university has created at least one such new job itself by hiring a dean, Jeff 
Dozier, a distinguished geographer. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthwatch will keep readers abreast of this evolving training project, but in 
the meantime, there are some useful, already available guides to "eco-jobs." 
"The New Complete Guide to Environmental Careers," compiled by Bill Sharp of 
the Environmental Careers Organization, is a valuable reference. 
</P>
<P>
 "Green At Work" by Susan Cohn shows how to find jobs at companies where 
environmental business may not be done but there are, nevertheless, individual 
departments of an environmentally friendly sort. 
</P>
<P>
 In the guidebook "Adventure Careers" by Alex Hiam and Susan Angle, there's 
advice on how to save the planet. The emphasis is more on the former word in 
the book's title than the latter, but hey, let's consider at least one fun 
episode in our five- or six-job lifetime. The magazine Earth Work contains a 
monthly survey of eco-jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 FYI: Learn how to recycle your career this Saturday at the free UCSB Extension 
seminar, "Changing Workplaces, Jobs and Lives," 8:30 a.m. to 2 p.m. at UCSB's 
Campbell Hall. Call 893-8401. 
</P>
<P>
 Recommended environmental career guides available at local bookstores or by 
phone: "Green At Work" by Susan Cohn and "New Complete Guide to Environmental 
Careers," Bill Sharp, principal author. Both are available by calling (800) 
828-1302. "Adventure Careers" is available at (800) CAREER-1.

JAUNTS; MASTER SHIP MODELERS THRIVE ON PRECISION, AUTHENTICITY; FAMOUS VESSELS 
RE-CREATED BY LOCAL CRAFTSMEN WILL BE ON DISPLAY AT THE VENTURA COUNTY MARITIME 
MUSEUM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The delicate touch that Jim Azbill needs to build a model ship -- with its 
intricate rigging, tiny knots, miniature pulleys that actually work -- is 
impressive, but his real mastery isn't even noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 Below deck, the ship is completely furnished. The cabin has bunks for the 
crew. The galley has a metal sink with faucet handles. 
</P>
<P>
 Authenticity, whether visible or not, counts with Azbill, whose models and 
those of other local builders will be on display at the Ventura County Maritime 
Museum beginning Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum's ship-model guild is holding its third annual show through Oct. 2. 
As many as 35 models will be exhibited at the museum at Channel Islands Harbor 
in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of the show is when builders actually work on models in the 
courtyard outside the museum on Saturday and Sunday and on Oct. 1 and 2 from 
noon to 3 p.m. It's a chance to chat with them about ships, and witness some 
precise handiwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors will see Azbill hunched over a model of the frigate "Confederacy." 
The original vessel was built in 1778 and fitted with 34 guns. It was retired 
with the dubious honor of never having fought in a battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the museum, another of Azbill's works is on display: a two-foot-long 
model of the schooner L.A. Dunton, a fishing vessel built in 1921. It took 
Azbill, a retired machine-shop owner, about six months to build it. That's not 
much compared to the 4,000 hours he expects to put into the "Confederacy." 
</P>
<P>
 This is not a hobby for impatient klutzes. Some builders use kits, but not 
Azbill. He builds his models from scratch, using plans similar to the original 
ship's blueprints. He hunts down the materials he needs, handcrafting each 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a store-bought part on this," he said, surveying the L.A. Dunton. 
</P>
<P>
 Why does he furnish the inside when no one can see it? " I know it's there," 
he said emphatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, he lives on a 45-foot ketch at Channel Islands Harbor and sets up 
his work on the dining-room table. "You wear magnifying glasses and every five 
years you get a stronger lens," he joked. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been at this hobby for 12 years, having completed eight models. "You 
build one and you hate to see it finished," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Azbill is among 40 members of the shipbuilding guild that formed at the museum 
in 1991. They meet each month for a kind of show-and-tell session in which the 
topic might be anything from rigging to making planks. 
</P>
<P>
 The median age of the group is 55 and nearly all are men, according to the 
museum's curator, Dick Cunningham. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an off-the-wall hobby," he said. "They're all terminally addicted." 
</P>
<P>
 Before they even begin building, they have to research the ship's history. 
Most were built anywhere from the 15th Century to the beginning of the 20th 
Century. 
</P>
<P>
 They construct models as small as one-eighth inch to the foot and as large as 
one-half inch to the foot. They haunt bait and tackle shops and fabric stores, 
searching for just the right linen line for the rigging. 
</P>
<P>
 "The well-rigged ship has up to 10 different weights of line," Cunningham 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the museum, the guild members have their own hero, the late Edward Marple. 
Nine model ships built by the master modeler are part of the museum's permanent 
collection. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Model ship show and demonstration. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Ventura County Maritime Museum, Channel Islands Harbor, 2731 S. 
Victoria Blvd., Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Exhibit opens Saturday and runs through Oct. 2. Museum hours are 11 
a.m. to 5 p.m., Thursday through Monday. Shipbuilding demonstrations are 
Saturday and Sunday and Oct. 1 and 2 from noon to 3 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: Admission to the museum is free but donations are welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: The museum's model shipbuilding guild will offer a series of Saturday 
classes for novices beginning after Jan. 1. For information about the classes 
and membership in the guild, call 984-6260.

FOR THE KIDS; GIRL SCOUTS EXPECT TO PROFIT FROM STAGING A CHAOTIC MESS; 
NICKELODEON'S 'WILD & CRAZY KIDS' TRADES ON SLIME AND ZANINESS. THE SHOW, WHICH 
USES ITS AUDIENCE, WILL BE IN OXNARD THIS WEEKEND. 
</P>

<P>
 To a kid, it's one of the greatest words: slime. So how about a contest to see 
which kid can glop the most green slime into a leaky cup atop his head? Is that 
cool or what? 
</P>
<P>
 That's the appeal of Nickelodeon's "Wild & Crazy Kids," a traveling show 
packed with don't-try-this-at-home zaniness. It's coming to the Oxnard Civic 
Auditorium for three shows this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second year, Tres Condados Girl Scout Council is sponsoring the messy 
madness as a fund-raiser. Last year's extravaganza drew almost 7,000 kids and 
adults and netted the Scouts $40,000. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's shows are on Saturday at 1 and 4 p.m. and Sunday at 1 p.m. Tickets 
are $10, $15 and $20. 
</P>
<P>
 The shows will be two hours, twice as long as last year's. And more kids and 
parents -- as many as 75 per show -- will be selected or cajoled into taking 
the stage for feats of, well, sheer stupidity. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who haven't seen this spectacle on Nickelodeon, it works this way. 
At the beginning of the show, the audience is divided into three teams that 
compete in a series of goofy stunts. They might be asked to face off in a 
crossword puzzle challenge where the letters are immersed deep in vats of 
slime. Or, they might don Velcro-type jackets and crawl around the stage trying 
to connect with some strange objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Messiness is the show's trademark. Contestants roll in goop of all sorts, and 
they might even eat it. Shows have been known to go through dozens of cans of 
whipped cream. 
</P>
<P>
 Emcees for the shows are Donnie Jeffcoat and Phil Moore. Jeffcoat, 19, was 
only 15 when he began hosting the show four years ago. He recently graduated 
from Irvine High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids who want to schmooze with Jeffcoat and Moore before the show can join 
them for a celebrities luncheon on Saturday or Sunday at 11:30 a.m. at the 
Oxnard Civic Auditorium. The cost is $10 and tickets are limited. 
</P>
<P>
 About 200 volunteers from service clubs and businesses are expected to help 
Tres Condados Girl Scout Council with the shows. The council, covering Ventura, 
Santa Barbara and San Luis Obispo counties, serves about 13,000 girls and adult 
volunteers. The money raised from "Wild & Crazy Kids" will be used to support 
drop-in centers, in-school classes, the council's program center, program 
expansion and troop activities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Peter & the Wolf" is the latest offering from Illusions Theatre in Ojai, but 
don't expect Prokofiev's version of this classic. For starters, the music style 
is rock 'n' roll and the ill-fated wolf in this version is simply relocated. 
</P>
<P>
 Shows begin at 7 p.m. at the outdoor Libbey Bowl on Friday and Saturday this 
week and next. A special show at 3 p.m. on Sunday is free for teen-agers. 
Otherwise, tickets are $6.50 for adults and $4.50 for seniors and children 
under 12. The final show will be signed for the deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 The production features 8-year-old Tyson Babayco of Ojai in the role of Peter. 
The wolf will be played by Jeannie Carlson of Ojai, a professional dancer and 
choreographer. 
</P>
<P>
 Kids are in for a special treat on opening night. Jerry Thompson, director of 
the Simi Valley Raptor Rehabilitation and Release Program, will have a real 
wolf named Indy on hand just before the show. 
</P>
<P>
 For ticket information, call 649-2324 or 649-1107. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Inlakech Teatro/Theatre Group and the city of Ventura are offering free 
classes for families who want to learn more about Dia de los Muertos, a Latin 
American tradition that honors deceased ancestors on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 During Saturday workshops, family members can learn about the history of the 
tradition and how to make masks of molded plaster to be worn during a 
procession. 
</P>
<P>
 The classes will be from 9 a.m. to noon on Saturday and succeeding Saturdays 
through Oct. 15, at the Westpark Community Center, 450 W. Harrison Ave. in 
Ventura. For information, call 658-4726. Details 
</P>
<P>
 * WHAT: Nickelodeon Studios' "Wild & Crazy Kids" shows. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHERE: Oxnard Civic Auditorium, 800 Hobson Way, Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 * WHEN: Saturday, 1 and 4 p.m.; and Sunday, 1 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * COST: Show tickets are $10, $15, $20. 
</P>
<P>
 * FYI: Tickets available at the auditorium, 486-2424, or Ticketmaster, 
583-8700. 
</P>
<P>
 * ETC.: Celebrities luncheon prior to the shows on both days, $10. For ticket

ON THE ROAD: THE ARTISTS' LIFE: LONG ON CREATIVITY, SHORT ON CASH

 The long and tall tan and white bus, 100,000 miles ago bright yellow and the 
ferry of public school children in Nebraska, pulls up outside Pete's Breakfast 
house on Main Street, creating for diners an eclipse of the sky. The entire 
restaurant staff files out to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawrence and Lori Anderson, residents of the bus for four months, have just 
finished fitting it out and are showing it off. The Andersons are dexterous and 
inventive, if anything, as both are stone sculptors and oil painters. 
</P>
<P>
 This old Harvester may as well be their quarry rock: Seats and floor torn out, 
the 30-foot-long room now has stuffed armchairs situated on a faux Oriental 
rug, reading lamps, kitchen cabinets painted cream with bright purple trim, a 
wall-mounted hand-crank coffee grinder, and a sink fed by a rooftop 40-gallon 
water tank. To the rear of the bus, where perhaps the last 30 students once 
bounced along, is a full-size bed draped in a homey patch quilt -- all beneath 
a bookshelf claimed by two kissing stuffed animals. To get to the bed, however, 
one passes through a plywood cutout whose curvy symmetrical opening is faintly 
Persian -- or a dead-on profile of the Liberty Bell, depending upon your point 
of view. 
</P>
<P>
 It's home, this bus. After living an apartment-to-apartment itinerancy as 
Ventura tenants, the Andersons decided that paying rent was bad news. They saw 
the ad for the bus at Pete's and picked it up for $1,500. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple also decided something else in recent months, something more 
important than their very dwelling: They've had it with art in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 "Art?" asks Lawrence. "If you're a welder or a (farmer), Ventura's a fine 
place. But it's too hard here, and I'm 50 and feeling beat from pounding on 
stone. Lori and I would take our sculpture to Marina Del Rey on weekends -- we 
called those trips our 'L.A. raids' -- and come back with enough money, 
sometimes two grand, to get by. And even in Ventura, we had a couple $5,000 
commissions, but that's rare. For the most part, it's a redneck place, and 
we're done here. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're out, gone, moving on. And this bus'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 That was the plan until only recently. Lori, poking around in the engine 
compartment, got the tip of a finger shorn off by a whirling fan belt. As of 
this week, skin had grafted over the bone, and talk of a new life elsewhere 
renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it be San Francisco? Lawrence lived there for 10 years in the '60s and 
'70s. Santa Fe? Lawrence lived there for 21 years as a contractor and then 
stone sculptor before meeting Lori, a Massachusetts emigre who served coffee at 
the local news shop. Boston? Lori's old stomping grounds, if an Air Force brat 
can ever call a place home. 
</P>
<P>
 It may, in the end, be someplace altogether new. But then it doesn't seem to 
matter a great deal to these full-time artists on wheels. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just go," says Lawrence. "Once you start moving, the destination finds 
you." 
</P>
<P>
 If that sounds slightly platitudinous, consider that it estimates the way 
Lawrence and Lori carve stone: by following natural contour and revealing 
shapes that are inherently within the stone's formation. As a result, the 
Andersons' stonework is organically figurative, Lawrence's given to a larger 
bolder scale and Lori's of a more intricate, inward nature. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that they are without an apartment and have given up their studio 
space at Art City II, near the mouth of the Ventura River, Lawrence and Lori 
paint. On board. "Acid Rain," a roiling depiction of Los Angeles beneath lurid, 
outsized, blood-red droplets, hangs at the entrance to the bus, not far from 
the vintage school bus sticker that demands behavior fit for "the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Andersons do leave town, they will tow their '69 VW bus behind. That 
bus is their current warehouse, art-show-on-wheels and, frankly, next meal in 
the main bus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are simply moved by the art spirit," says Lawrence. "That means being 
full-time artists doing the art. Selling it. And eating hot dogs and beans from 
the money." 
</P>
<P>
 What it also means is no health insurance -- Lori's finger got fixed, to the 
extent a bone-clipping is fixing, at the county hospital from a fund for 
indigents. And no particular security about where the next surge -- or trickle 
-- of cash will come from. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the $500 that was saved for the departure before Lori's accident is 
now spent, and, says Lawrence, "the only thing holding us back this very moment 
is having no cash." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the last four years in Ventura are any indication, cashlessness won't last 
too long. Even before they paired up in making and selling art, Lori and 
Lawrence were given to the extreme act. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori, in overcoming the caution and phobias "bred into all women," spent weeks 
kayaking along the rugged, temperamental Maine ocean coast "just to be alone 
for a while." And Lawrence, having fallen in love with Lori on sight in Santa 
Fe, pursued her to Boston after she left town abruptly. Granted, it did take 
him six weeks to get to her, but his method was emblematic of his ardor and 
smiling monomania: Carless with $37 to his name at age 44, he hopped on a 
bicycle and pedaled the 2,000 miles -- in a Speedo and sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
 That was six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's is a departure of another kind, at once a restored American impulse to 
take to the open road and start life again, and an adaptation to the current 
realities of a cash-slow economy and spotty art market. 
</P>
<P>
 Lori, a former high school English teacher, is most eloquent on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think, in a sense, we are missionaries," she says. "We're missionaries 
serving two purposes. People see the bus and see freedom and hope. And the art 
world today is a conspiracy of high prices, keeping real art out of the hands 
of too many people. Our prices have always been below market. So we're fighting 
the whole art conspiracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Freedom's patriots, art's guerrillas. That's more than enough to take them to 
the next stop, the next meal, the next life.

FASHION; CRAFTS, FROM RUSTIC TO RECYCLED, ADD NEW CHARACTER TO COUNTRY; IT'S 
EASY TO GET CARRIED AWAY WITH SUCH HOMEY MOTIFS AS COWS, SUNFLOWERS AND FISH. 
THE TRICK IS KNOWING WHEN TO STOP.

<P>
 On the newsstand at Ventura's Livery News & Books, you will count some eight 
magazines with the word "country" in their titles. 
</P>
<P>
 These journals, most launched in the last five years, deal with the country 
look , not the country sound. They show rooms filled with rugged pine or oak, 
quaint chests and hutches, lace curtains and cast iron stoves. In the '90s, a 
lot of Americans want their homes, well, homey . 
</P>
<P>
 But some folks can't manage a complete decorating overhaul. For them, there 
are collections . 
</P>
<P>
 Collections are things you stick in corners, on walls and shelves to give 
flavor to a room. In this case, country flavor. And, where it once took pricey 
antiques to set a rustic mood, now there is folk art. 
</P>
<P>
 American crafts are back from near-extinction, bigger than they've been in 
decades, say those who deal in the wares. Objects handmade in the U.S.A. are in 
demand, from art to kitsch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even young people buy it; they are tired of plastic stuff," said Nancy 
Wynands, an artist who owns Winkel Van Sinkel, a Ventura folk gallery in a 
gingerbread Victorian house. 
</P>
<P>
 Her shop is crowded with nostalgic goods, from wire pillow fluffers to 
distressed tick-tack-toe boards. The more primitive an object, the faster it 
sells, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Especially, they like things you make out of scraps," she said, "anything 
with the recycled look," such as paintings on old roof tiles and birdhouses 
crafted from dismantled barns. 
</P>
<P>
 The birdhouses are not so much for actual birds. Most buyers put them indoors, 
along with weathered-looking garden tools and pots of painted sunflowers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's become one of the current country looks -- garden. Another, still alive 
from its rebirth during the Gulf War, is Americana, with whole rooms done in 
red, white and blue. A newer look is mountain lodge. This theme is well 
represented at Rose Cottage in Thousand Oaks, a Janss Mall store the size of a 
museum where you could get lost for half a day. 
</P>
<P>
 In the mountain-lodge room there are carved fish, loons and other water birds. 
Big ones, not trinkets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's for those who always wanted a cabin," said owner Linda Kovach. "It has a 
real warm appeal." 
</P>
<P>
 The fish are hung on walls, the geese and loons -- how could you resist a loon 
in the living room? -- are placed about like decoys, and once you have one, a 
flock could gather, just like outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the trick in collections. You have to know when to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Magazines flooded birdhouses, so people think they have to go out and get all 
these birdhouses," said Kovach. "A few birdhouses, a few sunflowers are 
wonderful. But how many birdhouses can you have?" 
</P>
<P>
 Most collectors, she finds, make sophisticated choices. She is selective about 
craft items. "I don't buy anything that looks cutesy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynands has seen collections take over a house, not a pretty sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a chicken kitchen, or a watermelon kitchen," she said of determined 
collectors. "If it doesn't have a watermelon, it's not right." 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase to have at the ready for such a hostess is, "You must love this 
kitchen!" she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kitchens are a favorite place to convert to a country look, made easy by 
tin-punch decorative ware, newly crafted washboards, stoneware crocks, wire 
baskets and tea cozies. 
</P>
<P>
 We noted that many of the motifs double up: There are sunflower-shaped 
birdhouses, fish welcome signs and cow cookie cutters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holstein cow has to be one of the classic American symbols. Other folk-art 
animals abound, but the black-and-white bovine appears to be head and withers 
above all comers. Had we not taken careful control, we might have ended up 
creating a cow kitchen ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 In country circles, cows go beyond the standard Holstein cookie jars, pitchers 
and aprons. We found rocking-cows, cow bookends, cow birdhouses, an entire set 
of cow stoneware and a lamp with cowhide shade. 
</P>
<P>
 We won't even tell you the rest; it will leave you something to discover when 
you come into your own country cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 Kovach's theory is that there is always a universal style evolution operating. 
People may start with anything from Deco to Danish, but after experiencing the 
best art forms, they will come to cherish country. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, "you fall in love with it; you're hooked," she said. "Once you're into 
country, you don't go anywhere else."

SHOPTALK; GAMES APLENTY FOR ADULTS WHO HAVE PUT AWAY CHILDISH THINGS; PARENTS

 Ahhhhhhhh . 
</P>
<P>
 That was the collective exhale of thousands of Ventura County parents who have 
sent their children back to school. No more kids lying around the house all 
day. No more reminding them nonstop to do chores when the beach and video 
arcades were more persuasive. No more driving them back and forth and back and 
forth and back and forth. 
</P>
<P>
 That leaves a pretty sizable gap in the day for some parental leisure-time 
activities. You can go to the beach. You can hang out at the arcades. 
</P>
<P>
 Or you can play games. 
</P>
<P>
 It may sound childish. But in case you haven't noticed, there are lots of 
games on the market aimed at adults (some are for children too, but we won't 
tell them if you don't). 
</P>
<P>
 Being it's your leisure time we're interested in, we tried to save you some 
last week by doing game scouting. We went to John T's shop at the Buenaventura 
Mall, Kay-Bee toy store at the Oxnard Esplanade, Target in Oxnard, Toys-R-Us in 
Ventura and Sav-On drug store in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 We began with the old, time-honored game of Yahtzee. The basic version of the 
Milton-Bradley game went for $7.99 at John T's, $8.99 at Kay-Bee, $4.99 at 
Target and $5.99 at Toys-R-Us. Another classic, the basic Scrabble, went for 
$10.99 at Kay-Bee (down from $13.99), $9.99 at Target and Toys-R-Us, and $13.99 
at Sav-On. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the games we found kind of neat was one called Song Burst, in which 
players are given part of a line from a song and are asked to complete it (for 
example, "She wore an itsy . . . "). At Toys-R-Us, a country-Western version 
was $21.99, and the '70s-'80s version was $22.99; at Kay-Bee, the '50s-'60s 
version went for $12.97 (slashed from $29.99), and at John T's, the 
country-Western was $33.99. 
</P>
<P>
 Another popular game is Balderdash -- in which players try to bluff each other 
when guessing definitions of uncommon words. It went for $29.99 at Kay-Bee, 
$19.99 at Target and $32.99 at John T's. And no, we're not bluffing about the 
price differences. 
</P>
<P>
 A game that really caught our eye was one called Bottle Topps. Why? Because 
it's sort of an anti-Pog game. Instead of slamming bottle caps down, players 
try to stack them up. The idea is to pile as many wooden bottle caps as 
possible on top of a sleek wooden bottle. The Parker Brothers game went for 
$24.99 at John T's, $14.99 at Target and $16.99 at Toys-R-Us. 
</P>
<P>
 Other games we found intriguing included Jenga, the Milton-Bradley game in 
which players pull blocks out of a stack without making the stack collapse. It 
went for $19.99 at Kay-Bee, $14.39 at Target, $14.99 at Toys-R-Us, $19.99 at 
John T's and $17.99 at Sav-On. The game Bandu, kind of like Jenga in that you 
stack sculpted blocks and try not to let them fall, was $9.99 (down from 
$27.99) at Kay-Bee, $21.99 at Toys-R-Us, and $26.99 at John T's. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking of John T's, what we liked best about the place was that, though 
generally priced somewhat higher than the others, it has some obscure, truly 
adult items in stock, such as Mah Jong ($35.99). 
</P>
<P>
 John T's also had a game called "Over the Hill," for $15.99. It supposedly 
"keeps the mind in shape while the body goes." The idea of the game is to come 
up with more words in a given category than your opponent does. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, parents, if you do go shopping for yourself, just remember that you have 
to be back in time to pick your child up from school.

AT THE MARKET: IT'S TIME TO GET A HEAD START ON YOUR GARDEN FOR NEXT YEAR; 
NURSERIES ARE STOCKED WITH PLANTS AND BULBS THAT WILL BEGIN BLOSSOMING IN EARLY 
SPRING. 
</P>

<P>
 Nevermind that the fall season is still held off by the waning days of summer. 
Resolute gardeners are venturing into their landscape to begin preparing for 
early spring of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 This seasonal work starts every September. Fall is a favored time to sow an 
array of plants in Southern California -- and included at the top of the list 
are perennials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great time to plant those things that you want to root out before the 
cold weather hits," said Charles Gray, a nurseryman at Green Thumb 
International in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray explained that soil temperature during this time is still warm, creating 
an optimum environment for root growth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plant is able to get itself established before going into a shut-down 
period over the winter, which makes for an explosion of spring color," Gray 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He did say spring. So keep in mind: perennials will be busy taking hold 
underground, so don't expect much of a show above ground until then. 
</P>
<P>
 Most nurseries and garden centers across Ventura County are currently 
well-stocked with a healthy offering of these flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike annuals, perennials continue to live year after year. Blooming season, 
which normally comes once a year, can stretch from one week to more than a 
month, depending on the variety. 
</P>
<P>
 And varieties are many. 
</P>
<P>
 Perennials, Gray said, can take on such tremendously different form that there 
are far too many to mention. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can range from ground cover to bed filler, border plantings -- all 
different sizes, from 10-inches to four feet," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides most of the sages, the following also make for good fall planting: 
</P>
<P>
 Foxglove (digitalis) , an erect plant two to eight feet high with tubular 
flowers; Delphinium, fan-like foliage with columns of showy flowers; Columbine, 
lace-like foliage with gorgeous flowers in pastels and deeper shades. 
</P>
<P>
 Most nurseries offer "color packs" or "six packs" that contain starter plants 
for $2.29 or less. Larger, four-inch single plants can generally be purchased 
for $1.89 or less. 
</P>
<P>
 Left in the ground to grow year after year, perennials will begin to clump 
together and can actually begin to choke each other out. This can be prevented 
by digging up and separating and replanting to other locations. Caution: This 
thinning process should only be done during the plant's dormant period. 
</P>
<P>
 Perennials perform best in soil rich in organic matter. Consult your local 
nursery staff for each flower's specific needs before planting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 September is also the time to acquire bulbs, a specialized group of perennial 
plants, said Deanna Gore, vice president of the Conejo Valley Garden Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're wanting early spring blooming, you'll want to start thinking about 
getting your bulbs real soon," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to nurseryman Gray, selection at most nurseries is currently at its 
peak and so is product quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't wait too long to procure your bulbs. After another month or so, 
fall-winter bulbs will start to disappear as nurseries begin to stock 
summer-blooming bulbs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's early for planting bulbs but you have to get them while the getting is 
good," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 While some bulb types can be planted in late fall, others will have to spend 
time chilling in your refrigerator before they are planted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tulips and hyacinths, for instance, will have to spend six weeks in the 
vegetable crisper," Gray said. "The cold actually sets the bloom phase." 
</P>
<P>
 The danger in planting these early? 
</P>
<P>
 "If you plant now the warm weather would cause them to grow prematurely," he 
said. The result: The bulb would sprout a dwarf flower stem but the blooms 
would be anything but spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchase now and sink the bulbs in mid-January for late February and early 
March blooming, he said. November is a good time to plant those types not in 
need of chilling, he said.

 On my first trip to Japan many years ago, I was fascinated to discover how 
much the Japanese appreciate specialty restaurants. I found a place in Kyoto 
that served only tofu in 38 different ways, and I had a great time savoring six 
different courses of eel in a tiny spot in Osaka. 
</P>
<P>
 Citizens of bustling Tokyo enjoy noodle joints, sushi bars, tempura 
establishments, yakitori stands and okonomiyaki (filled pancakes) dives -- some 
just an escalator ride away from each other in high-rises. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Japanese like restaurants that serve single dishes prepared various 
way, Americans gravitate more toward a place with wider choices of many foods. 
Ken of Japan, a 10-year-old restaurant in Simi Valley, offers a taste of both 
worlds. One section of this giant venue can seat 40 customers around a number 
of grill tables for teppan yaki -- in which an entertaining chef grills meat, 
seafood and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 Another section contains a small sushi bar for those who want to concentrate 
on the permutations of fresh fish and vinagered rice. And finally, there's a 
large room of intimate booths (which includes two semi-private tatami tables) 
for all the other dishes that come to mind when I think of Japanese cuisine. 
But the food is consistently better if you stay with the specialists at the 
teppan yaki grills and the sushi bar. 
</P>
<P>
 In whichever room you're dining, I recommend starting with sushi, which is 
generously served and eminently fresh. I like the yellowtail ($3.50), 
inside-out California roll topped with smelt roe ($3.75), succulent tuna tekka 
maki ($4.20), and a special shrimp-covered avocado roll ($7). Among the regular 
appetizers, a crisp-fried soft shell crab ($4) is pleasant, but the savory 
dumplings known as gyoza ($3.50) are pasty, the egg roll ($3.50) is tasteless 
and chicken kara-age ($3.50), an eastern version of deep fried chicken 
McNuggets, tastes only of overused oil. 
</P>
<P>
 In the large dining room, I keep seeing gargantuan boats of food sailing by, 
which tempts me into ordering the Dream Boat Dinner (for two people at $14.95 
per person). The serving vessel contains a mountain of attractively presented 
food but, like a Hollywood stage set, appearances can be deceiving. The broiled 
lobster tails are topped with a strange coagulated sauce that desecrates my 
favorite crustacean, while shrimp and vegetable tempura become soggy atop a 
mound of salad. And the skewered beef kushiyaki and chicken and beef teriyaki 
all taste blandly alike in an overly sweet sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 A combination order of salmon teriyaki and halibut steak ($7.95) is so 
overcooked as to make the flavor of each fish indistinguishable. The best item 
on the menu is the sukiyaki ($7.95) of tender chicken served in a beautiful 
ceramic crock containing lightly cooked onion, bok choy and rice noodles in 
sake-laced broth. 
</P>
<P>
 In the teppan yaki room, I fare infinitely better as the skilled chef, 
wielding his mesmerizing knives, cooks everything perfectly. After ordering the 
New York steak and scallops combination dinner ($18.50), I begin with a starter 
of grilled shrimp accompanied by miso soup and salad. The chef then deftly 
slices mushrooms, zucchini, onions and carrots, which are grilled with sesame 
seeds. The vegetables are served with the lightly grilled steak, juicy scallops 
and a bowl of rice. 
</P>
<P>
 The seafood combination ($24) offers succulent grilled slices of lobster, 
shrimp and scallops. Among the other combinations is a felicitous duo of 
chicken and calamari ($14.50). 
</P>
<P>
 If you're adventurous, try the tempura ice cream ($2.50) in which the fried 
ice cream does stay intact, insulated with sweetened batter. I prefer ginger 
ice cream ($1.50) or freshly sliced oranges and melon ($3). 
</P>
<P>
 This handsome restaurant could become one of the county's better Japanese 
establishments if Ken Jung (the eponymous owner) would only upgrade the 
lackluster food in the main dining room to the level of the cuisine produced by 
the sushi and teppan yaki chefs. Details

 Simi Valley is scheduled today to become the newest home of a rapidly growing 
chain of restaurants known as HomeTown Buffet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County establishment is the 44th in the 4-year-old chain. Most of 
the restaurants are in California -- Modesto, Garden Grove, Anaheim, San Diego 
-- with strong showings in Oregon and Texas as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for the place to have a homey, American, feel -- heavy on forest green 
coloring and Norman Rockwell prints, not to mention the bee mascot that will 
hand out balloons on Thursday (family) nights. 
</P>
<P>
 General cost of a buffet meal (which includes dessert and drink) is $5.69 for 
breakfast, $5.39 for lunch, and $6.99 for dinner. Seniors are discounted 40 
cents and children under age 2 are free. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most unique aspect of the restaurant is the pricing for children 2 
to 10. They will be charged 45 cents per year of age for breakfast and lunch, 
and 50 cents a year for dinner. Lunch for a 6-year-old, for example, would cost 
$2.70. So bring your calculators. 
</P>
<P>
 The restaurant is located at 1855 Cochran St. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Ventura County teens are getting an early start in restaurant and hotel 
business education. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, 32 high school students from Ventura and Oxnard began a 
two-semester course aimed at teaching the ins and outs of the hospitality 
industry. The students meet two hours a day at Oxnard High School where, for 
the first semester, the curriculum will include regular classroom work, tours 
and guest speakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll have some chefs coming in -- pastry chefs, executive chefs, sous 
chefs," said instructor Mary Hopple of the Oxnard High home economics 
department. "We'll have speakers from the hotel industry talking about the 
front desk, housekeeping, banquet service. We'll have someone from the tourism 
board." 
</P>
<P>
 During the second semester, students will get hands-on experience with 
internships at local hotels and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Hopple said the idea is to show the students a viable career opportunity. "We 
want to show them the different levels of service in a growth industry in this 
area," she said. "It's anticipated that there will be a growth in employment in 
(the hospitality industry) of 42% by 2025 in Ventura County."

ALPHA BETA GREW FROM INNOVATIVE START 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alphy, Alpha Beta's long-retired corporate mascot, hasn't had much to smile 
about lately. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1960s and 1970s, from his perch atop Alpha Beta signs throughout 
Southern California, the impish cowboy character looked down upon a strong, 
growing chain with more than 300 stores and thousands of satisfied customers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alpha Beta, unlike most of its competitors, was born and grew up in the 
suburbs," said La Habra resident Esther R. Cramer, a former Alpha Beta employee 
and a longtime Alpha Beta shopper who wrote a book about the company in 1973. 
"It was a pillar of the community, the place to shop. In the early '50s we 
called it the country club, because we met all our friends there." 
</P>
<P>
 But after a hostile takeover in 1979, the chain slowly began to lose the 
cachet that had made it a special place to shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, there will be only memories left for employees and shoppers of Alpha 
Beta, which opened its first Orange County store in 1917 in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, a formal agreement was announced by Ralphs Grocery Co. to 
complete a $2.5-billion merger with the owners of Alpha Beta. After the merger 
is completed, the company will eliminate the Alpha Beta name and merge the 
longstanding chain into Ralphs. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal, which must be reviewed by antitrust regulators, would create 
Southern California's largest supermarket chain. In Orange County, the combined 
company would operate 31 Ralphs supermarkets plus 31 Alpha Beta stores, three 
Viva stores and two Food 4 Less warehouse stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Grocery industry observers said that the food chain had failed to keep up with 
competitors that were opening new stores and spending heavily to upgrade 
existing locations. More bad news hit in 1991 when Alpha Beta's corporate 
parent sold off a hefty portion of the chain to La Habra-based Food 4 Less in 
order to satisfy antitrust regulators. The rest of the chain was merged into 
the Lucky grocery chain. 
</P>
<P>
 Many longtime Alpha Beta shoppers believe that "the handwriting was on the 
wall" after the hostile takeover in 1979, said Cramer, 67, who handled consumer 
affairs for Alpha Beta until she retired in 1986. "We were always head and 
shoulders above everyone else, but that began to (slowly) change in the early 
1980s." 
</P>
<P>
 Customer service was paramount when Albert C. Gerrard opened the first Alpha 
Beta store in Pomona in 1917. Gerrard's brother, Hugh, opened Store No. 2 later 
that year at 318 4th St. in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, Phil Gerrard -- Hugh's son -- went to work at Store No. 2. 
"My father put us children right to work when we were just kids," said the 
81-year-old Irvine resident. "He would mark (prices on) one item and put it on 
the shelf and then give us the pen or pencil and we'd get to work." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Alpha Beta remained "pretty much a family affair," Gerrard said. 
"Most of the stores were owned by my uncle's brothers or brothers-in-law. Store 
No. 6 wasn't really a relative, but he had strong connections to my father and 
uncle. Store No. 7 was operated by the man who'd taught my father and uncle to 
cut meat." 
</P>
<P>
 Alpha Beta's name dates back to 1915, when Albert Gerrard hit upon a novel way 
to help shoppers locate products in his Gerrard's Triangle Grocery store in 
Pomona. The grocer arranged products in alphabetical order on store shelves -- 
hence the name, Alpha Beta, the first two letters of the Greek alphabet. 
</P>
<P>
 "My uncle was a very astute man," Gerrard said. "He got the concept of 
self-service very early." 
</P>
<P>
 Alpha Beta solidified its ties to Orange County when it incorporated in Santa 
Ana in 1929 and later moved its headquarters to La Habra. The Gerrard family 
sold its stake in Alpha Beta in 1961 after arranging a friendly merger with 
Philadelphia-based American Stores Co. 
</P>
<P>
 There were tough years at the beginning, but Alpha Beta's growing chain proved 
to be popular with shoppers. "We made a profit every year except for 1929, 
which was a really bad year," said Placentia resident Fred Cantrell, 79, who 
retired from Alpha Beta in 1980 after a 30-year career. 
</P>
<P>
 When Cantrell joined the company in 1949 as a butcher, Alpha Beta had 24 
locations. When he retired as the executive in charge of public relations, the 
chain had more than 300 stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime Alpha Beta executive Claude Edwards, a Laguna Beach resident who died 
in 1993, is credited with having engineered most of the chain's growth during 
its heyday. "Mr. Edwards was the man who really had the vision of moving the 
chain," Phil Gerrard said. "He was responsible for the real expansion of Alpha 
Beta." 
</P>
<P>
 Former employees linked Alpha Beta's success to its willingness to serve the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always had the feeling that you built a store with people, not with the 
store itself or the goods," Cantrell said. "I think that philosophy of business 
has been disappearing." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Cramer, Alpha Beta prospered because Albert Gerrard and 
subsequent executives "were not afraid to innovate. . . . They started the 
first automated grocery sorting process, had the largest truck fleet in the 
state, were the first to (use) air freight to bring in fresh fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were the first to put shopping cart corrals in parking lots," Cramer 
said. "They were just ahead of times on most things." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerrard said he still makes occasional trips to the Alpha Beta store on Culver 
Drive in Irvine, a store that, coincidentally, now bears the corporate identity 
of Store No. 2. But he said he's pleased that Alpha Beta's name will be 
replaced by the Ralphs nameplate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ralphs, along with Vons, have always been the real leaders in Southern 
California," Gerrard said. "Ralphs is the one that's always stood head and 
shoulders above the rest. I've always had high regard for the Ralphs people." 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell, for one, will miss the Alpha Beta name. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you were part of the family, you'd feel like something's been taken away 
from you," Cantrell said. "A lot of people put a lot of time, effort and tears 
into that store." 
</P>
<P>
 "It will seem strange to drive around and not see any Alpha Betas anymore," 
said Richard P. Gladden, 65, an Anaheim Hills resident who retired as Alpha 
Beta president in the late 1980s after 40 years with the company. "When I pass 
these stores I remember opening so many of them. It's something I spent my 
whole life at." The Road to Expansion

SUPER-MERGER; PARENT OF O.C.'S ALPHA BETA FINALIZES DEAL TO BUY RALPHS FOR $1.5 
BILLION 
</P>

<P>
 Touting their union as a deal that will help them upgrade stores and escalate 
the local price war, the owner of Orange County-based Alpha Beta supermarkets 
on Wednesday completed a long-anticipated agreement to acquire 121-year-old 
Ralphs Grocery Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Yucaipa Cos., which also owns the Viva and Food 4 Less warehouse stores -- 
which have headquarters in La Habra -- and the Boys chain, signed a definitive 
agreement to acquire Ralphs from the Ohio-based DeBartolo Corp. for $1.5 
billion. The value of the combined company would be $2.5 billion, making it the 
largest supermarket merger in California history. 
</P>
<P>
 The pledge of lower prices is doubted by some antitrust experts, and the 
merger still faces scrutiny by state and federal regulators. It approved, the 
combined company would be the largest supermarket chain in Southern California 
with 27% of the market -- surpassing long-time leader Vons in sales and store 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the combined company would operate 31 Ralphs supermarkets 
plus 31 Alpha Beta stores, three Viva stores and two Food 4 Less warehouse 
stores. 
</P>
<P>
 The two firms, which had been in talks for more than a year, missed several 
informal deadlines in recent days because one of the six Ralphs' shareholders, 
Paris-based Banque Paribas, had withheld approval. But that impasse was 
resolved Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies said they plan to combine their operations by November or 
December. Though Yucaipa is the acquiring company, Ralphs management will run 
the vast enterprise on a day-to-day basis, an acknowledgment that the Ralphs 
chain is a stronger chain. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies say they have not yet determined how many jobs would be 
eliminated. The headquarters for the combined company is to be located at 
Ralphs current corporate offices in Compton. A smaller staff will continue to 
work at the La Habra offices of Food 4 Less Supermarket, which operates the 
Alpha Beta, Viva and Food 4 Less chains. 
</P>
<P>
 Company officials would not specify how many stores might close or the number 
of jobs to be lost in Orange County. And company officials did not discuss the 
fate of Food 4 Less' bakery and distribution facility, which is also in La 
Habra. 
</P>
<P>
 The combined entity is to be called Ralphs Grocery Co. and Yucaipa plans to 
convert all of its Alpha Beta, Boys and Viva markets to either Ralphs or Food 4 
Less warehouse stores. The new partners promised to improve service by adding 
staff at the stores and to lower prices, partly by converting some existing 
sites to the low-price Food 4 Less warehouse store format. 
</P>
<P>
 Though consumer groups have voiced concern that the reduced number of players 
on the Southern California supermarket scene will mean higher prices, some 
customers seemed pleased to know that Ralphs will be in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ralphs stores are just laid out better," said Irvine resident Shobba 
Hingoran. "I shop Alpha Beta, but not for my major shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 She used a simple gauge to explain why she looks forward to the merger. "Look 
at the parking lot," Hingoran said while loading half a dozen bags of Alpha 
Beta groceries into her trunk. "It's hardly ever full. Then look at Ralphs. . . 
. You'll see it's always filled." 
</P>
<P>
 As expected, Yucaipa Chairman Ron Burkle is to become chairman of the merged 
firm and Ralphs Chairman Byron Allumbaugh will become the chief executive of 
the combined company. In interviews, they said they are converting the stores 
because the 121-year-old Ralphs has a higher public profile than the younger 
Alpha Beta, Boys and Viva chains. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ralphs has a very good image . . . and it doesn't make sense to operate under 
different names," Burkle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ralphs President Al Marasca is be the new company's president while George 
Golleher, president of Food 4 Less Supermarkets, will become vice chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 They will oversee an enterprise that currently includes 167 Ralphs, 131 Alpha 
Beta, 24 Boys and 15 Viva stores as well as 30 Food 4 Less warehouse stores. 
However, many stores are expected to close and an undetermined number of jobs 
lost in neighborhoods where the chains now overlap, a process that will be 
watched closely by antitrust regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the conversion of all surviving traditional supermarkets to the 
Ralphs format, up to 30 of the existing Ralphs are to be converted to Food 4 
Less stores to better compete with existing warehouse stores and the 
anticipated challenge from Wal-Mart, which will be opening grocery operations 
in California under its "superstore" format. 
</P>
<P>
 Burkle and Allumbaugh said that with two chains -- Ralphs and Food 4 Less 
warehouse stores -- instead of the current five, the company can save $100 
million annually by consolidating administrative and distribution functions. It 
can also slash advertising budgets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take the costs savings and pass them along to consumers," Burkle 
declared. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Trade Commission and California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren are 
conducting reviews to determine whether consumers will be helped, hurt or 
unaffected by the mega-deal. They could block the deal or, more likely, force 
the combined company to sell some stores on antitrust grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're taking a very close look at it," said Lawrence Tapper, deputy state 
attorney general. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, some local supermarket chains have been forced to pare down 
merger plans in the face of opposition by regulatory agencies. For example, 
though Alpha Beta's former corporate parent, American Stores, was permitted to 
merge Alpha Beta stores with Lucky in Northern California in 1991, it was 
forced to sell 145 Alpha Beta stores in Southern California to Yucaipa on 
antitrust grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the major competitors of the planned new company had no comment on the 
merger, but one supermarket executive said a combined Ralphs-Food 4 Less would 
have too great a presence in certain neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "The potential for price gouging is greater when you dominate an area," he 
said, asking anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 The new entity will respond to possible price-cutting by competitors with 
promotions of their own in a bid to lure customers at Alpha Beta, Boys and Viva 
sites that are converted to Ralphs and Food 4 Less formats, said executives at 
the two companies.  
</P>
<P>
 But some real estate brokers said that there appears to be relatively little 
overlap between the two grocery store operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two companies are working different neighborhoods, so to speak," said 
Ted Lawson, a senior vice president with CB Commercial in Torrance. "Food 4 
Less is working its way up, Ralphs is working its way down, and they share some 
middle zones. So there might not be a lot of duplication. I don't see them 
dropping stores unless they're on the same block." 
</P>

BRIEFCASE: REAL ESTATE; INVESTMENT BANK RATES PRESLEY COS. STOCK 'VERY

 Donaldson, Lufkin & Jenrette is again tracking Presley Cos. and finds the 
Newport Beach home builder's stock "very attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that Presley recently sold $200 million of junk bonds and reorganized 
its finances, a report from the New York investment bank predicts that Presley 
"can finally position itself to respond to an improving California economy." 
</P>
<P>
 The seven-page report cautions, however, that Presley's stock "remains a 
speculation, but now we believe the speculation is not on the company's 
survival but on how quickly earnings improve." 
</P>
<P>
 The company is projecting earnings of $1 to $1.25 a share by 1997 and a stock 
price of $6 a share within a year. The stock was trading at just above $3 a 
share in this week's trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Donaldson Lufkin analysts had followed the company earlier but stopped doing 
so after Presley's stock took a nose dive during the real estate downturn of 
the early 1990s.

COMPARISON SHOPPERS SIZE UP WHAT'S IN STORE FOR THEM; MERGER: SOME WELCOME THE 
MERGER, BUT THEY WONDER ABOUT THE FATE OF OLDER ALPHA BETAS NEAR NEWER, BIGGER 
RALPHS MARKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Lisa Rodriguez is pressed for time but has to pick up a few groceries, 
she zips into the Alpha Beta grocery store on Culver Drive in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the Irvine resident wants to fill the pantry, her store of choice is 
the nearby Ralphs on Harvard Avenue. "When it's time to do major shopping I 
never go to Alpha Beta," Rodriguez said during a morning trip to feed bottles 
and cans into Alpha Beta's recycling station. "I like the way the (Ralphs) 
store is laid out, I like the meat prices better, and they have a better 
selection." 
</P>
<P>
 Rodriguez and other Orange County shoppers who swear by Ralphs' service, 
selection and prices said they welcomed news that the long-anticipated 
acquisition of Ralphs Grocery Co. by Yucaipa Cos., which owns La Habra-based 
Food 4 Less, is now official. Food 4 Less operates the Alpha Beta, Boys and 
Viva chains and Food 4 Less warehouse stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Once California's largest supermarket merger is completed, Yucaipa plans to 
convert many of the Alpha Beta locations operated by Food 4 Less to Ralphs 
supermarkets. Yucaipa also hopes to sate growing consumer demand for better 
value -- and gird for battle against discount leader Wal-Mart -- by converting 
some Ralphs stores to Food 4 Less warehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like that, if this was a Ralphs," Rodriguez said of her neighborhood 
Alpha Beta. "But you have to wonder if they're going to keep this store open. . 
. . There are two Ralphs close by already." 
</P>
<P>
 Yucaipa officials haven't said which locations will be closed or converted, or 
what is in store for Food 4 Less' corporate headquarters, bakery and 
distribution warehouse in La Habra. But the merger most likely will change 
shopping habits in Orange County and beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Included in the deal would be 31 Ralphs supermarkets, 31 Alpha Beta stores, 
three Viva stores and two Food 4 Less locations operated by Food 4 Less. 
Grocery industry observers said Yucaipa won't close stores if it means losing 
valuable market share. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're simply not going to give up a store and let the competition take it 
over," said John Shumway, president of Market Profiles, a Costa Mesa-based real 
estate consulting firm. "If they do give up buildings, they'll be smaller, less 
efficient locations." 
</P>
<P>
 The merger, Shumway said, will help both Ralphs and Food 4 Less "penetrate 
areas they couldn't penetrate alone." 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra City Manager Lee Risner said he has heard few specifics about the 
deal from executives at Food 4 Less. "They're a privately held company," he 
said, "and they're keeping their cards close to the vest." 
</P>
<P>
 Alpha Beta customers this week were already speculating, however, about the 
fate of older stores that are near newer, bigger Ralphs supermarkets. Grocery 
industry observers said that the longtime Orange County-based chain relied too 
long on stores built in the early 1960s and was surpassed by chains with 
bigger, more modern stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ralphs is right across the street from here," said Costa Mesa resident Kay 
Lemon, who has been shopping at the aging Alpha Beta store on East 17th Street 
in Costa Mesa for more than 15 years. "This is an old store, and Alpha Beta 
does have the new store over in Triangle Square." 
</P>
<P>
 Lemon, who has shopped only once in the new Alpha Beta in the basement of the 
Triangle Square retail complex, said that store "is a good one, but it takes 
some footwork to get in and out of that parking garage." 
</P>
<P>
 Some shoppers said they don't expect the deal to mean major changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll get a new sign out front, that's about it," said Gordon Hull, who shops 
at an Alpha Beta near his Laguna Niguel home. The prices at Ralphs, he said, 
"are about the same. So is the selection. All it is is a different name."

 New Headquarters: Disc Manufacturing Inc., the compact disc maker, has bought 
a new headquarters building in Anaheim for $7.1 million and plans to add 90 
employees by next June, company officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The publicly traded firm, which now has 170 employees, is moving to a 
220,000-square-foot building on 14 acres at 3400 E. La Palma Ave.Voit 
Commercial Brokerage represented both the buyer and the seller -- Rockwell 
International Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "This new facility will allow us to increase both our manufacturing 
capabilities and our personnel," said Tom Brown, general manager of Disc 
Manufacturing's Anaheim plant. "We looked out of state, but we decided to stay 
in Anaheim because this is where our employees are, and they are our best 
asset." 
</P>
<P>
 DMI makes 44,000 compact discs a day and expects to double that output by 
mid-1995. The company, which occupies 30,000 square feet at 1120 Cosby Way in 
Anaheim, expects to complete its move by late November.

BAD CHECK WRITERS BOUNCE BACK AFTER COUNSELING; SANTA ANA-BASED FIRM'S PROGRAM 
AIMS AT PREVENTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOPE HAMASHIGE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris, 39, calls himself a "floater." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that it would take two days for my check to clear at the market, so 
two days before I deposited my paycheck, I would write a check there," said 
Chris, who asked that his last name not be used. "I studied my statements and 
figured out exactly how many days it took between when I wrote the check and 
when the bank cleared it." 
</P>
<P>
 The technique bankers call "float" -- using to your financial advantage the 
time required for a check to clear -- finally caught up with Chris. "I owed 
money to the IRS, and one day they took all the money in my account, and the 
checks I had floated bounced," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that he knew that he owed the Internal Revenue Service money but never 
guessed the agency would seize his checking account. 
</P>
<P>
 During that period, one of the merchants to whom Chris wrote a bad check 
turned him in to the Orange County district attorney, and he ended up in the 
Bad Check Restitution Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a system similar to privately operated traffic schools, where ticketed 
drivers can attend a class to keep the citation from raising their insurance 
rates, those who pass a bad check can avoid misdemeanor charges and fines of up 
to $400 for each check by attending an eight-hour course. 
</P>
<P>
 The class, which costs $100 to attend, has been operated by Santa Ana-based 
American Corrective Counseling Services in cooperation with the Orange County 
district attorney's office for 3 1/2 years. The goal is to educate participants 
in ways to prevent them from bouncing checks again. 
</P>
<P>
 American Corrective Counseling's instructors are required to have degrees in 
counseling, and most are licensed psychologists, said Kathy Stewart, operations 
director. An assistant district attorney works with the instructors to ensure 
that they cover the points of law that must be included in the course, mostly 
informing the participants of the penalties for writing bad checks. 
</P>
<P>
 The instructors concentrate on helping bad check writers become aware of the 
circumstances that led them to write the errant checks and to avoid falling 
into a pattern of such behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 The course is a mix of practical advice about dealing with banks and learning 
about the penalties that face bad check writers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talk a lot about values," instructor Alicia Romanowski said. "And we find 
that writing bad checks conflicts with the values that most people have." 
Writing bad checks, Romanowski said, is often the result of people finding 
themselves under extreme pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 In such situations, mundane tasks such as balancing checkbooks or calling the 
bank to ensure that all deposits have been credited before starting to write 
additional checks take a back seat to more pressing issues, such as final exams 
or looking for a job. 
</P>
<P>
 The course also serves as a sort of support group to help offenders understand 
why they engaged in destructive behavior. That mix of practical advice and 
emotional support is working, said Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi, adding that 
the program has more than a 99% success rate. That is, fewer than 1% of those 
who complete the program wind up in the legal system again for writing bad 
checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Capizzi also said he is impressed with the program's success in recovering 
merchants' losses. By the end of 1994, an estimated $2 million worth of bad 
checks will be recovered for Orange County businesses, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 American Corrective Counseling receives $87.50 of the student's fee, while the 
district attorney's office takes $12.50 to cover its end of the administrative 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Stewart said American Corrective Counseling is expanding the bad check writers 
program and recently signed on with the district attorney's offices of San 
Diego, Riverside, Santa Clara, Solano, Merced, Humboldt and San Joaquin 
counties to operate similar classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Mealing, executive director, said about 14,500 people have been through 
the check program in Orange County since its inception, which would mean 
revenue of nearly $1.27 million at $87.50 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 American Corrective Counseling maintains that the $100 fee -- which must be 
paid in cash, no checks -- is a bargain, because writing bad checks can be 
expensive. Those convicted can expect to pay $300 to $400 for each check they 
bounce. They may also face up to six months in jail. Those who attend bad check 
school avoid paying the fines and the jail time; the offense is not added to 
their record. A person must, however, repay the merchant in full and any 
related bank fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Most rubber checks are written because of poor communication between couples 
with joint checking accounts, especially when one partner overspends a 
pre-established limit, Stewart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband goes through the mail. One of my checks bounced, and he forgot to 
tell me," complained Sheila, a class attendee. 
</P>
<P>
 People are so busy, they often don't have more than a 10-minute chat with 
their spouses for several days, Romanowski said. "When they do finally see one 
another, they want to see how they are, not talk about how many checks they 
have written." 
</P>
<P>
 But for each tale of a negligent spouse, an equal number of class members 
blame vindictive former lovers. One class participant, Ron, said he began to 
bounce checks after his mate deserted him and skipped town after draining his 
bank account. 
</P>
<P>
 The following are some of the suggestions that were made to avoid ending up in 
court over bad checks in the future: 
</P>
<P>
 * Make sure the checks you deposited have been credited to your account before 
you write checks for the money. Though people don't expect it, even payroll 
checks can bounce. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't expect your bank to take care of bounced checks for you. Talk to 
someone in the institution who has the authority to run a bad check through a 
second time and check back to make sure it has been done. If you think your 
bank is causing you problems, you can always transfer your money to a different 
bank. 
</P>
<P>
 * Look into the possibility of getting overdraft protection for your checking 
account, but don't use it like a credit card. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always balance your checkbook. Do not neglect to make a record of all the 
checks you write, even when it is inconvenient, such as when you are in line at 
the supermarket. Take the extra 30 seconds to write your check amount in your 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 * Always keep a record of withdrawals from ATM machines.

DIRTY DOZEN BAND CREATES ITS OWN TRADITION; JAZZ: THE GROUP, IN LONG BEACH 
TONIGHT, HAS UNAPOLOGETICALLY TAKEN THE BOURBON STREET SOUND IN NEW DIRECTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's become something of a fashion statement these days to pledge allegiance 
to the music of New Orleans. The city has long been a birthing ground for 
particularly idiosyncratic strains of jazz, blues, rock, funk and country, but 
in recent years the rest of the world has caught up with the Big Easy's rich, 
longstanding traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with such relatively high-profile compadres as the Neville Brothers, Dr. 
John, and French-Canadian transplant Daniel Lanois, the Dirty Dozen Brass Band 
-- which performs tonight at the Foothill in Long Beach -- has done its share 
in bringing the celebratory, polyrhythmic sound of the Crescent City to a wider 
audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed as a traditional, New Orleans-styled horn octet in 1978, the Dirty 
Dozen later added elements of be-bop, swing, soul and funk to the intoxicating 
sound of Bourbon Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't get any gigs as a traditional band," Dirty Dozen 
trumpeter-bandleader Gregory Davis said in a recent phone interview from a San 
Diego hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a couple dozen other traditional bands happening, and we were just 
another one of them," he said. "Nobody was taking us seriously, so we ended up 
trying other music at rehearsals -- some Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington, Miles 
Davis and some James Brown, Ray Charles and Aretha Franklin. That's when we 
started to feel each other and click." 
</P>
<P>
 Signed by the small Concord Jazz label in 1984, the group made its debut with 
the exuberant "My Feet Can't Fail Me Now" album, which showcased the Dirty 
Dozen's rootsy, partying side. Still, some jazz and brass-band traditionalists 
all but screamed blasphemy at the Dirty Dozen's melting-pot sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh yeah, we got it from all angles," Davis said with a chuckle. "We got it 
from everyone but the people that were hiring us. . . . So we said, 'The hell 
with so-and-so, he's not the one paying.' The people that paid wanted to hear 
what we were doing, so we went with that, and the gigs started rolling in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After another album release, this time on Rounder Records, the Dirty Dozen 
landed a major-label deal with Columbia Records in 1989. As the group's 
reputation grew, so did the demand for its services among rock audiences and 
musicians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dirty Dozen went on to play bills with the Grateful Dead, the Dead Milkmen 
and 2 Live Crew, and to appear as guests on albums by Elvis Costello, Phil 
Alvin, Manhattan Transfer and Poi Dog Pondering. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rock cats didn't look at us as a traditional band or a jazz band or what 
have you," Davis said. "They fell in love with the sound of what we were doing 
as musicians. With them, we didn't have to go through all that crap that we did 
with the jazz cats; they respected us for what we were doing." 
</P>
<P>
 As the Dirty Dozen continues to tour and record, its sound has matured into a 
refined groove that finally has won respect from the jazz community. Perhaps 
the transcendent moment of redemption for Davis came when jazz trumpet legend 
Dizzy Gillespie -- a boyhood hero -- appeared on "Voodoo," the group's Columbia 
debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Dizzy and I first met, it was dreamlike," he said. "Here was a person I 
wanted to be like, and I got to meet him and talk to him and shake his hand. We 
actually got to be friends over the years. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "You can read the books and what people have to say about someone, but it's 
not like meeting them and being around them. When he consented to be on the 
album, I didn't even know how to say thank you. He came to the studio, and he 
was a jokester, a prankster, but at the same time he was educational. He wasn't 
shy about saying: 'Look, man, don't do that. Maybe you should try this.' And I 
really appreciated that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dirty Dozen continued to grow musically. The group's 1991 album, "Open 
Up," contained sophisticated, original compositions that signaled a new, more 
serious direction. Particularly impressive was Davis' ambitiously extended, 
Ellington-influenced suite, "The Lost Souls of Southern Louisiana." No longer 
could jazz elitists deny the Dirty Dozen's excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 So it seemed curious that last year's follow-up, "Jelly," was a collection of 
songs written by Jelly Roll Morton, the self-proclaimed "inventor of jazz," and 
one of the most important figures in New Orleans' musical heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were heading in the direction where we were going to do another album 
where we experimented with original compositions," said Davis. "But then 
Columbia came up with the idea to do a Jelly Roll Morton album. It was a good 
idea -- very educational. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then -- after we recorded it and before it came out -- they decided it was 
something they didn't want to promote, for whatever reason. We got into a big 
argument, a big blowup about that and parted company."  
</P>
<P>
 Davis said the group is now biding its time, waiting for its contract with 
Columbia to expire at the end of this year. He hopes to be signed by another 
label and have a new album out early in 1995.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Musically, more changes are in store that could further outrage the Dirty 
Dozen's traditional-minded critics -- Davis revealed plans to add keyboards, 
bass guitar and full trap-kit drums to the lineup for its next album. The group 
had, to this point, retained the conventional brass-band instrumentation of 
snare and bass drum for percussion, sousaphone as the bass voice and no 
electric instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 But after years of work, and with critical acclaim for the group outweighing 
the voices of the naysayers, Davis is secure enough to proceed in the way he 
sees fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really didn't have a sense that we'd been accepted by anyone until I had to 
replace two of the guys in 1991," he said. (Sousaphonist Kirk Joseph and 
trombonist Charles Joseph were replaced by Julius McKee and Revert Andrew, 
respectively.) 
</P>
<P>
 "When we had to replace these people, we found dozens of sousaphone and 
trombone players who actually knew what we played and were up on what we were 
doing," he said. "That shocked and touched me. I was really surprised. That's 
when I had a sense that maybe we have done something, maybe we have had some 
influence after all." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Dirty Dozen Brass Band and Phil Alvin perform tonight at the Foothill, 
1922 Cherry Ave., Long Beach. 9 p.m. $12. (310) 984-8349.

RIORDAN SAVORS RETURN OF GRAMMY CEREMONIES TO L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<P>
 Stressing the economic and image benefits of the Grammys to Los Angeles, Mayor 
Richard Riordan on Wednesday welcomed the award program back to the city and 
vowed to help keep it here. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entertainment industry . . . is the most important business we have," the 
mayor said following a press conference at City Hall to announce that the 
Grammys will return to Los Angeles on March 1 for only the second time in the 
last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 " . . . People (in L.A.) were taking it (the Grammys) for granted for all 
these years and then you lose it and you realize maybe you should have been 
loving it," Riordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next spring's ceremony -- the 37th annual Grammy program -- will be held at 
the Shrine Auditorium and telecast live on CBS-TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan was joined at the press conference by Michael Greene, president of the 
National Academy of Recording Arts & Sciences, and Richard Palmese, president 
of MCA Records and co-chair of the local Grammy host committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Until recently, Los Angeles practically owned the Grammy event. Through 1990, 
the show had been held here 28 times, compared to only four in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 But aggressive campaigns by New York city officials and business leaders 
tipped the scale Eastward. Not only did New York see the event as prestige for 
the city, but officials also estimated that hosting the show has meant as much 
as $40 million a year in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A.'s Grammy efforts, in contrast, have been criticized by music industry 
leaders as lackluster, with few business people outside the music world 
involved. After losing the show to New York in 1991 and 1992, then-Mayor Tom 
Bradley and several record executives stepped up the effort and won back the 
show last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But New York regained it this year and apparently hoped to stake a permanent 
claim to the ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 Greene said Wednesday that Riordan has impressed the industry by showing a 
commitment to the Grammys and to related educational programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But what about the future? Should we expect the yearly Grammy tug-of-war to 
continue between the two cities? 
</P>
<P>
 Greene refused to speculate, saying that the decision is made on an annual 
basis and that the academy must consider its New York constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan appears ready for the competition. He feels the L.A. business 
community is "waking up" to the importance of such events, though only music 
industry figures were represented at the press conference. Palmese said, 
however, that a co-chair of the host committee drawn from the business world 
would be announced soon.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One businessman, Sheldon I. Ausman, chairman emeritus of the Los Angeles 
Convention and Visitors Bureau, was on hand in an unofficial advisory capacity 
and noted that events such as the Grammy show can help revive the city's image, 
battered by riots, earthquakes and crime reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's interest in the Grammys isn't apparently all business. After the 
press conference he chatted with Greene, enthusiastically discussing an old 
album teaming jazz pianist Bill Evans and singer Tony Bennett. 
</P>
<P>
 He also grinned as he showed off a letter from Grammy telecast producer Pierre 
Cossette jokingly offering Riordan a chance to sing a number to his New York 
mayoral counterpart on the telecast -- "I Get Along Without You," with backing 
by the Red Hot Chili Peppers and U2's Bono.

READY FOR MC MICKEY?; POP MUSIC: DISNEY LOOKS FOR CROSSOVER SUCCESS WITH 
ORIGINAL SONGS AND PARODIES OF RAP HITS ON 'MICKEY UNRAPPED.' BUT USING THE 
CONTROVERSIAL GENRE MAY PROVE RISKY. 
</P>

 Disney's making rap music? It may seem like an odd partnership: the 
conservative, squeaky-clean Disney and a controversial music genre frequently 
slammed for misogynistic, sex-and-violence content. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet before the mega-success of Walt Disney Records' "Aladdin" and "The Lion 
King" soundtracks, what was the company's big bonanza? If you guessed "The 
Jungle Book," "Fantasia" or "Mary Poppins," guess again: It was 1979's "Mickey 
Mouse Disco" that took double platinum honors. 
</P>
<P>
 So here comes "Mickey Unrapped," a riskier venture into urban musical 
territory, which Disney hopes will bring similar success. 
</P>
<P>
 The all-rap album is set for release Tuesday, featuring Mickey, Minnie, Goofy 
et al. mixing it up in original songs and parodies of rap hits with Tag Team 
rap duo, Color Me Badd and Whoopi Goldberg. On the album cover is Mickey, his 
hands gesturing in vague rap style, wearing street gangsta chic: a backward 
baseball cap and oversize baggy jeans, belted well below his skinny waist. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Jaffe, vice president of Walt Disney Records, expects major crossover 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are more rap albums purchased in suburban America than urban America. 
Rap has truly taken over the American popular psyche like no other since 
disco," he enthused. "We think the popularity of this parody of rap will be 
enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mickey's really into his rapping: 'I'm so cool, My ice cream never melts.' 
But he's Mickey, he's been Mickey for 60 years and he hasn't changed. He's just 
having fun with a new popular music form in America. The songs are parodies: 
'Ice Ice Mickey,' 'What a Mouse,' 'You Can't Botch This,' 'Ducks in the Hood' 
and then, of course, the single 'Whoomp! (There It Went),' which features the 
original artist Tag Team," whose "Whoomp! (There It Is)" was a monster hit in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe stressed that the album's goal was to "provide a positive lyrical 
approach, and we were very conscious of how we chose our lyrics and the context 
in which they were sung. Perhaps I should say, with this album more than any 
other, we were conscious of that." 
</P>
<P>
 One double-entendre was apparently overlooked, however, in "Whoomp! (There It 
Went)," which is featured as the album's single and its live-action/animated 
music video. The street term "get busy" -- applied to Mickey and friends -- may 
have an innocuous meaning to most parents, but there's a "wink-wink" sexual 
connotation that's just as familiar to many young people. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the music video, (the characters) are in the context of a party and Mickey 
and Donald and Goofy are dancing during those segments," Jaffe said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But in speech there are always double-entendres people don't really intend. 
We can't control how people perceive and interpret lyrics that were not 
intended to have any other meaning than the positive lyrical messages we 
produce with the albums." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Bell, former Motown president and founder of Bellmark Records, Tag Team's 
label, had a slightly different reaction. "I thought I was fairly current," he 
said after several moments of chagrined laughter. "I thought I was hip. I 
should have asked my son. . . . But I love that part and in the video, they're 
dancing. . . . Oh, my goodness." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell, who is known for his insistence that his rap artists do clean lyrics, 
said he was delighted at the idea of one of his favorite childhood icons being 
involved with the young rap duo Tag Team. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Tag Team, I saw it as really institutionalizing them. . . . Further, I 
really appreciated it because I've been concerned about the bad rap that rap 
music has gotten, because most of the media focus has been on the negative 
aspects of it. I thought it was sort of unfair. That genre has had more of a 
profound effect than any other on young people. The Mickey album adds a 
positive position on rap music and puts balance on the marketplace." 
</P>
<P>
 A quarter of a million albums have been shipped for Tuesday's release and 
Disney's full-bore marketing strategy includes "a direct response commercial" 
that began running on cable and UHF channels Aug. 15, a "really aggressive" 
retail co-op advertising campaign, print and television appearances and special 
events. 
</P>
<P>
 In retail outlets, the album will be placed not only in the children's music 
section but "wherever popular music is sold," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things we've been fighting at the retail level is the notion it's 
a kids' record. We've made it plain to them that this is not a kids' record, 
it's a hit record, and hit records appeal to all demographics, kids or not." 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary reaction to the single, already getting airplay in some pop 
markets, is "positive. They've been inundated with telephone calls from adults 
and kids who are in love with it," Bell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Marriott, an editor at the Source, the leading national rap music 
magazine, doesn't see the album succeeding with a crossover audience, however.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way. The rock (demographic) is not trying to hear Mickey Mouse. 
Disney is about making money and rap music makes money and so it makes sense -- 
when disco was hot they had an album. It's kind of corporate logic. It's a safe 
bet we won't be reviewing it." 
</P>
<P>
 Marriott said he had seen the "Mickey Unrapped" TV promo, but had not heard 
the album. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob DeMoss, youth culture specialist for the Christian media watchdog group 
Focus on the Family, said, "It's perfectly fine for Mickey Mouse to use rap 
music in a positive way. Perhaps some of the artists who are set on so much 
negativity can get a clue. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Thompson, the Miami attorney who led the anti-obscenity crusade against 
Miami rap group 2 Live Crew, hasn't heard the album either, but he is an 
enthusiastic Disney fan -- "my 2-year-old son is absolutely out of his skull 
about 'The Lion King.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He does have a reservation about "Mickey Unrapped," however. 
</P>
<P>
 "Disney doing a rap album is like Mother Teresa wearing lace garters," he 
said.

HOPING TROUPE WILL SEE THE LIGHT; A 'STRANGE SNOW' LESS BROODING THAN THE FILM 
VERSION WOULD SUIT THE AUTHOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Back in 1989, Stephen Metcalfe was a reasonably successful playwright ready to 
embark on a new career in glittering Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jacknife," Metcalfe's screen adaptation of his own play, "Strange Snow," was 
about to premiere. Clearly, it was an exciting time for the author, especially 
since none other than Robert De Niro had been picked for the starring role. 
</P>
<P>
 But even then, Metcalfe was worried. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to say I had mixed feelings about De Niro" playing Megs, the Vietnam 
War veteran who performs an emotional rescue on his soldier buddy, Dave, 
Metcalfe said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There was this little voice in my head saying he wasn't right . . . his 
approach (turned out to be) too dark; he didn't connect (with the play's) sense 
of fun," he recalled during a recent telephone interview from his San Diego 
office. "I was ultimately frustrated" by the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jacknife" received mixed reviews, and Metcalfe was one of its toughest 
critics. If only it had wound up more like "Strange Snow," which Metcalfe said 
isn't a mire of brooding and despair, even though it addresses a serious 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
 The 41-year-old La Jolla resident said he hopes the Laguna Playhouse will be 
sensitive to that aspect of the drama as it opens the company's 75th season 
tonight. He said the humor should be emphasized because "when I originally 
wrote it, I wanted to do something of a funny love story." 
</P>
<P>
 The relationship that develops between Megs and Martha (Kathy Baker in the 
movie), Dave's spinster sister, is at the heart of the love story. But there's 
also love between Dave (played by Ed Harris in "Jacknife") and Megs, who breaks 
into their life of solitude one morning with the unspoken mission to bring both 
brother and sister back into the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Megs has come through hell himself and now faces life with gab and vitality. 
As a Times critic described him in a review of a 1987 production of "Strange 
Snow" in El Cajon, Megs is "irresistible -- part 'Rainmaker,' part 'Music Man' 
and part 'Elmer Gantry' -- but unlike those con men, the thing he is selling is 
the truth." 
</P>
<P>
 In Metcalfe's opinion, the film version could have been less moody had De Niro 
switched roles with Harris. De Niro's more serious interpretation would have 
fit Dave, while Harris, an actor with a natural comic edginess, may have been 
more appropriate as the talkative savior, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Metcalfe had little control over the casting or anything else. Shortly 
after his script had been chosen, a writers' strike prevented him from taking 
part in the production. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although this first-time venture was frustrating, Metcalfe has stayed with 
movies, either writing or co-writing such films as "Pretty Woman," 
"Arachnophobia" and "Cousins." He's drawn to Hollywood for various reasons; one 
of the most obvious is the money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the creative satisfaction of working on a play really can't be beat," 
Metcalfe said, "but it was becoming more and more difficult to make a living in 
the theater. Film work, if you can get it, is lucrative." 
</P>
<P>
 Metcalfe said he looks at "Strange Snow" with fondness, if only because it is 
one of his most frequently produced plays (he's also written "Vikings," "Half a 
Lifetime" and "Sorrows and Sons," among others). 
</P>
<P>
 It's been staged so many times since premiering at the Manhattan Theatre Club 
in 1982 that Metcalfe feels the drama has "taken on a life of its own. 
Sometimes I think that I don't really have ownership of it anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Metcalfe never served in Vietnam, the story of Megs and Dave was 
close to him because it reflected the turmoil experienced by many of his 
friends once they came home. Metcalfe created their characters and their story 
as a composite of the people he knew in the aftermath of the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "I originally wrote it as a one-act play called 'Spittin' Image' that just 
expanded," he said. "What interested me was not so much the Vietnam experience, 
but what the characters, especially Megs, went through." As for the Laguna 
Playhouse production, Metcalfe said he's kept his distance because he doesn't 
want to affect director Robert Leigh's approach. He does have a bit of advice, 
though, for Leigh and his cast of Ron Campbell as Megs, Andrew Barnicle as Dave 
and Linda Gehringer as Martha. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a play that has a tremendous amount of things happening 
between the lines; there's also plenty of silences," he said. "If it's done 
well, they will fill in between the silences. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to find out what's going on beneath the surface, what's going on 
beneath the words, what's really happening with these people," he said. "I 
guess that's the same with any good, demanding drama." 
</P>
<P>
 * The Laguna Playhouse's production of Stephen Metcalfe's "Strange Snow" opens 
tonight at Curtain: 8 p.m. Continues Tuesday through Saturday at 8 p.m.; 
Saturday and Sunday at 2 p.m.; and Sunday at 7 p.m. through Oct. 9. There will 
be a signed performance Friday. $13 to $22. (714) 497-9244.

 Wrong price -- An article on Sunday incorrectly reported the cost of Thousand 
Oaks' new City Hall voice mail system. The $300,000 price covers not only voice 
mail, but also the telephone hardware and a network of high-tech data 
transmission lines.

CITY HALL JOURNAL: HAWAIIAN GARDENS; COUNCIL WEIGHS PLAN FOR POLICE DEPARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials are examining a plan to create a 20-member police force for the 
city, which currently contracts with the Los Angeles County Sheriff's 
Department for police services. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council members said they are looking into options -- possibly federal 
money from the new crime law -- to pay for a police force, which would cost an 
estimated $900,000 to establish and $2.1 million a year to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be great for our city, but we have to find the money to pay for it," 
Councilman Domenic Ruggeri said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to estimates, a police force would cost the city about $500,000 a 
year more than it pays for sheriff's patrols, but some expense -- about 
$225,000 -- could be offset by parking fines and traffic citations. Currently, 
the city pays about $1.5 million a year for the sheriff's contract.  
</P>
<P>
 Hawaiian Gardens shares law enforcement services with five other Southeast 
cities: Lakewood, Bellflower, Paramount, Artesia and Cerritos. The 300-deputy 
force operates out of the Lakewood station and does not have an office in 
Hawaiian Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal does not stem from any specific problems with sheriff's services, 
but a desire to shift toward more community policing, said Walter McKinney, 
Hawaiian Gardens' director of community safety. McKinney recently prepared a 
report at the council's request. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies' policing style is primarily reactive and call-driven, said 
McKinney, who was recently hired to serve as a liaison between the city and the 
Sheriff's Department and advise the City Council on police issues. A city 
police force, he said, would be more proactive and prevent more crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Capt. Frank Vadurro disagreed. He noted that four deputies are 
assigned exclusively to deal with Hawaiian Gardens' community concerns, such as 
gangs and graffiti, in addition to regular patrols that cover the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reality is that we have worked closely with the community there, putting 
resources in before problems become big problems," said Vadurro, who oversees 
the Lakewood station. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawaiian Gardens police plan would give the city 20 sworn officers, a 
police chief, a lieutenant, four sergeants, six dispatchers and a small 
civilian administrative staff. The most likely place for a police station is a 
vacant, 3,200-square-foot store on Carson Street that is owned by the city's 
Redevelopment Agency. JOHN POPE

CITY HALL JOURNAL: NORWALK; AFTER YEARS OF DEBATE, CITY OKS HINDU TEMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CANALIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a Hindu congregation's plans to build a 
$1.2-million temple at 15213 Pioneer Blvd., ending nearly two years of debate 
between the religious group, the city and residents that live near the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The council approved the measure last week by a 4-1 vote.Councilwoman Judith 
Brennan cast the dissenting vote. "I had problems with the traffic pattern and 
felt there was not enough parking," Brennan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The temple will have room for 322 people. The site also will have 105 parking 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 A small group of residents spoke against the plan at the council meeting, 
saying they feared the temple will attract worshipers throughout Southern 
California, clogging residential streets.  
</P>
<P>
 In July, the council ordered the group to alter the temple's design, replacing 
its golden Indian domes with a red tile roof to blend with the Spanish-style 
architecture in the area. JOHN CANALIS

RINGING DENOUNCEMENT PROMPTS REVIEW OF CHARGE FOR FALSE ALARMS; SAFETY: LONG 
BEACH BUSINESS OWNERS SAY THE $300 PENALTY AFTER THE FOURTH INCIDENT IS UNFAIR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of business owners who say they're being unfairly charged for false 
burglar alarms at their stores won a small victory Tuesday when the City 
Council agreed to review the city's false-alarm ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Enacted in 1989, the law charges $300 for every false alarm at a home or 
business after the fourth alarm at the site.  
</P>
<P>
 Some businesses and homes have been fined thousands of dollars. In the last 
fiscal year, the city collected $352,225 in charges for false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small businessmen have so many penalties -- and this is just one more -- that 
they're being run out of Long Beach," said the Rev. Len Bacon, an associate 
minister at two local wedding chapels who helped organize the campaign to 
reduce the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Leevers, owner of Rainbow Tire and Service, said he is reconsidering 
whether to renew his store's lease next year after the city took him to Small 
Claims Court to force him to pay $4,500 for repeated alarms. He agreed to pay 
the bill in monthly installments after losing his case. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm paying $150 a month for the rest of my life," Leevers said, 
half-jokingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach imposed the charge to help recover the cost of police response to 
false alarms and to encourage business owners to keep their alarm systems 
properly maintained, said Bud McDonald, manager of the city's commercial 
services bureau, which issues alarm permits. 
</P>
<P>
 "If those alarms aren't serviced on a regular basis, they have a tendency to 
become overly sensitive," McDonald said. "Then the police have to go out there 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Bacon, Leevers and others recently took their concerns to Councilwoman Jenny 
Oropeza. She asked the council to send the issue to the Economic Development 
and Finance Committee for review. Oropeza also asked the city to investigate 
charges imposed by other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Both requests were approved unanimously. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach charges more than several nearby cities for responding to false 
alarms.  
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood, for example, imposes a fee if authorities have to respond to a third 
false alarm in a 30-day period. The charge would be based on the time deputies 
spend answering a false-alarm call, but the city has never imposed one, city 
spokesman Donald Waldie said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lakewood's ordinance was also enacted in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Compton and Signal Hill impose charges after three false alarms per calendar 
year at a business or home. Signal Hill's charges range from $25 to $200, based 
on the number of alarms. Compton charges $50 to $150. 
</P>
<P>
 Norwalk does not charge for false alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach business owners such as Morris Roberts say they hope the city will 
look at those numbers and reduce the charges.  
</P>
<P>
 "They should know that when a business is socked with exorbitant fines like 
that, we have to pass that cost on to the customer in higher prices," said 
Roberts, who owns Rio Junior Market and Liquor Store on Anaheim Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody loses, but that's the way the retail business works," Roberts said. 
"It worries me. How is this city going to survive and thrive with all these 
fees?"

SWAP MEET OFFERS NEW SELLING POINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN POPE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Paramount Swap Meet has completed the first part of a multimillion-dollar 
renovation that has added more vendor spaces, parking and a food court to the 
nearly 40-year-old marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, swap meet officials have spent about $3 million on the 
project. Improvements include 5 1/2 acres of additional land, an 8-foot-high 
wall with landscaping along Paramount Boulevard, increased security, new 
entrances and about 300 additional vendor spaces, for a total of about 800 
spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Swap meet officials said they plan to spend $5 million in the coming year to 
acquire more land and make other improvements to the site at 7900 All America 
City Way. Currently, about 630 vendors sell a wide variety of new and used 
items, including clothing, cleaning and auto supplies, toys, music, fresh 
produce and baked goods. The swap meet is open seven days a week at the 
32-acre, open-air site. The atmosphere is festive, with vendors hawking their 
wares above the steady beat of Mexican banda music. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Redevelopment Agency provided $800,000 toward the renovations, an 
amount that city officials said they will recoup in about four years. With the 
expansion, the swap meet is expected to generate an additional $200,000 to 
$280,000 a year for the city, said Richard Leahy, assistant city manager. The 
market had generated between $400,000 and $500,000 a year, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The swap meet was founded in 1955 at the old Paramount Drive-In movie theater 
by the late Joseph Bianchi. 
</P>
<P>
 Bianchi clashed often with city officials, who complained that the swap meet 
was bringing more traffic problems, crime and litter to Paramount. Bianchi's 
son, Glenn, took over the marketplace after his father's death in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Glenn Bianchi has been more responsive to the city's concerns, prompting 
officials to provide some financial help, Leahy said. JOHN POPE

CSULB MAY LIMIT SPECIAL ADMISSIONS; EDUCATION: LAST YEAR'S DROPOUT RATE 
APPROACHED 75% AMONG THESE FRESHMEN, WHO WERE ADMITTED DESPITE FAILING TO MEET 
MINIMUM ENTRANCE REQUIREMENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN COX, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Long Beach officials are considering whether to reduce the number of 
freshmen who are admitted despite failing to meet minimum entrance 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 About 22% of last year's freshmen did not meet minimum standards for 
admission, and the percentage has been increasing in recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 A faculty report has suggested that these special admissions be limited to 15% 
of the freshman class since these students are more likely to drop out. Nearly 
three-fourths of the students who failed to meet admission standards dropped 
out, compared with about half of the students who met admissions standards. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also suggested stepping up recruitment efforts to attract better 
students, and providing more counseling and support services to students to 
reduce dropout rates. 
</P>
<P>
 President Robert Maxson has set up a special committee of administrators, 
faculty and staff members and a student to discuss how to improve services to 
new students. The committee will also consider whether to limit special 
admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial report that recommended a 15% limit on special admissions was 
ordered earlier in the year by university Provost Karl Anatol after a national 
survey revealed that Cal State Long Beach students were taking longer to 
graduate than the average student in public universities. The survey found that 
52% of the students nationwide graduated within six years, while only 36% of 
the CSULB students graduated in that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Any cutback could be controversial, however, since one of the goals of special 
admissions is to increase minority enrollment. About 85% of the students 
admitted under special circumstances last fall were minority. About two-thirds 
of the total freshman class last fall was minority. 
</P>
<P>
 Some professors and college deans say they support the report's 
recommendations. They argue that the university is accepting too many students 
who are unprepared to do college-level work. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we bring in (students) who are ill-prepared to be here and we simply flunk 
them out, we haven't helped them and we haven't helped the state," said C. J. 
Walter, dean of CSULB's College of Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 But some administrators say the university has an obligation to make 
exceptions to give these students a chance to earn a college degree. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the university's responsibility to serve the communities that support 
it," said Doug Robinson, vice president for Student Services. "If they come 
from economically disadvantaged communities, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of closing the door on such applicants, the university should provide 
more tutoring and counseling, Robinson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maxson said he believed that a 15% limit on special admissions would be 
reasonable. He also argued, however, that the university should be prepared to 
help students who haven't met admissions requirements. Maxson said the 
university should "provide some support service to help (such students) get up 
to speed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1994-95 budget, Maxson set aside $50,000 to make more faculty available 
to advise freshmen.  
</P>
<P>
 Alma Salazar, student body vice president, said the university should offer 
more tutoring for weaker students rather than limiting the number of special 
admissions. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of students who are borderline (when they decide) whether to 
come to a university," Salazar said. "People who come in through special 
admissions see that they have potential to succeed in the university." 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of special admissions among the university's freshman class 
grew from 11% in fall, 1989, to 22% last fall. In actual numbers, growth is not 
so dramatic since the total number of freshmen declined from 2,579 to 1,566 in 
that five-year period, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Special admissions in freshman classes throughout the 20-campus California 
State University system rose from 13% in 1989 to 18% last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshmen must have a high school diploma, a C average in college-preparatory 
courses and a B average in all subjects. Students who have below a B average 
could meet admission standards by high scores on standardized tests such as the 
Scholastic Aptitude Test. 
</P>
<P>
 Adela De La Torre, chairwoman of CSULB's Chicano and Latino Studies 
department, said administrators should be trying to bring in more students from 
all backgrounds, not fewer. "We're in a declining enrollment state. You can't 
be that picky," she said.

<P>
 Montebello school officials have declared an impasse in negotiations with the 
union that represents teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Personnel director Bill Erwin said the district decided to seek help from a 
state-appointed mediator after talks with the Montebello Teachers Assn. ran 
aground recently.Erwin said the district expects a mediator to be named before 
the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has been fighting a proposed 5.3% wage cut. The district is also 
seeking a 2% reduction of non-teaching staff. A 5.3% salary cut for 
administrators took effect in July. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers say they will not agree to the proposed reduction in wages because 
they accepted a pay cut three years ago when the district was in financial 
trouble. In addition to a pay reduction, the district is also seeking to freeze 
health benefits and pay increases based on years of experience.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are not negotiating another pay cut," teachers association President Clyle 
Alt said. "We believe the district needs to quit spending money that it doesn't 
have." PSYCHE PASCUAL

 The school board has ousted board member Lynn Dymally, who has not attended a 
board meeting in a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The board declared Dymally's seat vacant Tuesday night."The seat needs to be 
filled by someone who is going to be here and participate," said board 
President Michael Hopwood. "Our goal is to have the board at full strength." 
</P>
<P>
 The district can appoint a successor or schedule a special election to fill 
the seat, county education officials said. Supt. Harold L. Cebrun said 
officials have not decided which option to take.  
</P>
<P>
 Dymally, 36, was elected to the seven-member board in 1991. Her term would 
have expired in November, 1995. She was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials have given varying reasons for her absences. Cebrun said that 
until early this year she had periodically called and said she was sick. Others 
say she has boycotted meetings to protest the state takeover of the Compton 
Unified School District, which has reduced the board to an advisory body under 
state administrator Jerome Harris. JOHN D. WAGNER

COMMUNITY NEWS: NORWALK; REP. TORRES SEEKS TO CLOSE JET FUEL DEPOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Esteban E. Torres (D-La Puente) has asked Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry to close a jet fuel storage depot in Norwalk, saying it poses a toxic 
threat to nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Homes across the street from the tank farm would be in danger if the facility 
on the corner of Norwalk Boulevard and Excelsior Drive catches fire, explodes 
or releases poisonous fumes, Torres said in a letter to Perry. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres also claims that fuel from the depot has tainted soil and ground water 
below the site and is decreasing nearby property values. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1991 study by the Defense Department revealed that the storage yard's soil 
and ground water were contaminated with the cancer-causing agent benzene and 
another solvent at depths of 40 feet. The contamination was not viewed as a 
threat to the city's drinking water supply, which is drawn from between 240 
feet to 1,250 feet down. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is capable of storing 36 million gallons of jet fuel. Currently, 
25 million gallons are stored there, said Defense Department officials. The 
facility provides fuel for military bases in Southern California, Arizona and 
Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to it as "a costly relic," Torres said the 50-acre storage facility 
is an inefficient use of funds in the current era of defense cutbacks. The 
military pays a private contractor $1.2 million annually to operate the site, 
said Lynford Morton, a Defense Department spokesman. The facility employs 27 
workers, Morton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres claims the Defense Department would save money by storing the fuel in 
tanks at the defense fuel supply point in San Pedro or at individual military 
bases. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton said storing the fuel in San Pedro is not a reasonable alternative 
because the Norwalk site is connected to a pipeline critical to distributing 
the fuel to California and other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres wrote a similar letter in 1990 asking former Defense Secretary Dick 
Cheney to close the tank farm, said Roddy Young, the congressman's press 
secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 The military began a cleanup of the storage depot's soil in 1991, Morton said. 
The project should be completed by 2003, he said. JOHN CANALIS

COMMUNITY NEWS: LA HABRA HEIGHTS; BRUSH FIRE FEARS SPARK TOUGH SMOKING RULES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city's fire chief -- citing a strong potential for brush fires -- has 
banned smoking in many undeveloped areas and in parked vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking is now forbidden on hillsides, vacant lots and land that does not have 
at least one inhabitable structure, said interim Fire Chief Robert C. 
Wilson.Violators face up to $1,000 in fines, six months in jail or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking is still permitted in private residences and businesses, yards and 
moving vehicles. Other exceptions include parks, play fields and the city's 
golf course, which are well irrigated and less likely to catch fire, Wilson 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoking was banned in parked cars because occupants have been known to throw 
cigarettes from them when they're done, Wilson said. State law already 
prohibits drivers from tossing lighted materials from moving vehicles, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for fire in La Habra Heights is not noticeably greater than in 
the recent years, but last year's wildfires in Malibu prompted city and fire 
officials to adopt preventive measures, Wilson said. "We have become more aware 
of what a brush fire can do," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the potential for fire greatly diminishes, the chief can rescind the ban, 
said Joe Perez, interim city manager. JOHN CANALIS

<P>
 Cal State Long Beach has settled its lawsuit against three companies involved 
in the construction of a music building that collapsed four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 University spokeswoman Toni Beron said the university and the companies 
reached a settlement last month, but under the terms of the agreement could not 
release details. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing the companies were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The university filed suit accusing the companies of negligence and breach of 
contract after the roof of the Gerald R. Daniel Recital Hall collapsed July 2, 
1990. The suit named as defendants Long Beach architects Hugh and Donald Gibbs, 
the Shirley Brothers Inc. construction firm of Pasadena and truss manufacturer 
Trus Joint Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The recital hall and two other nearby buildings reopened last year after $2.7 
million in repairs. The $6.3-million recital hall was built in 1982. Roofs on 
two other nearby buildings that were designed and built by the same companies 
also had to be repaired, Beron said. 
</P>
<P>
 A consultant hired by the university to investigate the collapse said the roof 
was poorly designed and improperly built. Some areas were missing nails and 
some wood supports had never been installed, the consultant said. PSYCHE

COVER STORY; CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE; SERVICE-POOR UNINCORPORATED AREAS CAN SEEM 
WORLDS APART FROM NEIGHBORING CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG KRIKORIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In most ways, the residents of affluent Hacienda Heights have little in common 
with the largely working-class community of South Whittier or struggling East 
Compton. But in one important way, they're connected by more than a maze of 
surface streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Those three communities, and many other enclaves throughout vast Los Angeles 
County, lie in a bureaucratic no-man's-land. 
</P>
<P>
 Unincorporated Los Angeles County, they call it. Areas, some only a few blocks 
long, that are not part of any city. Areas that are the wards of Los Angeles 
County, administered -- often badly -- by a jurisdiction that has a larger 
population and budget than many states. Areas that are sometimes rich, more 
often poor. Areas that have been shrinking in number. 
</P>
<P>
 What is it like to live in an unincorporated area? 
</P>
<P>
 Some will tell you they get along just fine. "I like it," Vicky Quintero, 23, 
said of the neighborhood sandwiched between Cerritos and Norwalk where she, her 
husband and three children live. Their block of older tract homes has no street 
lights, she acknowledged. But she and neighbors say that is of no concern in 
the tiny enclave, just south of Cerritos College, where residents know each 
other's comings and goings. The area receives all the services -- from reliable 
law enforcement to regular street sweeping -- of other neighborhoods, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, are anything but pleased.  
</P>
<P>
 In an area straddling East Compton now known as Rancho Dominguez, Vaughn 
Holiday and other residents insist they're not getting services they deserve. 
For example, "the trash people do not make the pickups they're supposed to," he 
said outside his family's home on White Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And don't get Butch Redman started on the topic. "You are missing out on 
representation completely," said Redman, who has lived 46 of his 51 years in a 
gritty area south of Whittier known as Sunshine Acres, in the house his father 
built. "When a problem arises, there is no one to turn to except in downtown 
Los Angeles. And you just play phone tag there." 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how residents feel, unincorporated areas are likely to retain 
that status for the foreseeable future. One reason is that lawmakers have made 
it more difficult for communities to incorporate as cities. And any 
unincorporated area worth annexing probably would have been snatched up long 
ago by an adjoining city. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past 20 years, the number of residents living in unincorporated areas 
has declined. In 1974, the number was 1,046,500 or nearly 15% of the county's 
population of 7.1 million. Today, while the county population has swollen an 
additional 2 million, the number of residents in unincorporated areas has 
declined to 962,000 -- just over 10% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop might not be so significant if it were not for the fact that the 
remaining unincorporated areas -- left behind by happenstance or their own 
choosing -- are generally low- to moderate-income neighborhoods. That can mean 
some of the neediest of areas receive the least attention, officials admit. 
</P>
<P>
 "All areas of the county can have a lack of social services because of the 
economy and needs of a changing population. But the unincorporated areas 
usually have the greatest need," said Lorraine Barber, executive director of 
the Federation of Community Coordinating Councils of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally speaking, (unincorporated areas) have been ignored," said Rose 
Ibanez, field deputy to County Supervisor Gloria Molina. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The problems have been exacerbated by years of neglect and other factors, said 
Robert Alaniz, Molina's press deputy. "There was the (cut in funding) and for 
all intents and purposes, there was no local organization to push for areas . . 
. and quite frankly, there were areas that were overlooked." 
</P>
<P>
 One obvious area of neglect, he said, involved inspection of substandard 
buildings in East Los Angeles, which is in Molina's district and is the 
county's most populous unincorporated area with a population of at least 
130,000 residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some properties were being used as gang hangouts. Some were abandoned homes. 
Some were (neglected by) absentee landlords. And nothing was ever done about 
it," Alaniz said. "One thing we did was put together a task force of (county 
agencies) to look at unincorporated areas." The agencies began to clean up 
dangerous buildings, or demolish them in some cases, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Rose said Molina has made service requests in unincorporated areas a priority 
"because they are the ones who have no other representation." Residents in 
unincorporated areas make up much of Molina's constituency. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the road for services in unincorporated areas can often be bumpy. 
</P>
<P>
 Just ask Victor Ledesma. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For years, he said, he and other residents of a vast unincorporated area near 
Whittier pleaded for services from a county bureaucracy that was big enough to 
help but too large to navigate. So in an area with almost 110,000 residents -- 
about the population of Inglewood -- basic services were inadequate and even 
emergency services were lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was doing anything," Ledesma said. "At the time, there were 
(neighborhoods with) no street gutters, no paved sidewalks; lots of streets had 
no street lights. Oh God, it was horrible," Ledesma said. 
</P>
<P>
 The community also lacked protection, he said. "For many years, we only had 
one patrol car for the whole area," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaints mounted about crime, traffic and lack of response to requests 
for service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whittier County Community Coordinating Council was founded in 1986, 
Ledesma said, but community participation was sporadic until late 1990, when a 
schoolgirl was struck and killed in a crosswalk on a busy street. Her death 
galvanized residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "That little girl was killed and that got the county to (speed) up the 
process" of installing a traffic signal, Ledesma said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents began pressing for better services. Eventually, they formed an 
unusual partnership with the county and the city of Santa Fe Springs -- a 
small, industry-rich community with a sizable tax base that can support plenty 
of government services. 
</P>
<P>
 The group set up a law enforcement/building team to tackle concerns ranging 
from drug dealing to slum housing. The so-called COPS team (Community-Oriented 
Problem Solving) has cleaned up more than 100 houses that had major violations 
of building codes, health and safety regulations, and other laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The team includes sheriff's deputies, firefighters, safety inspectors, urban 
planners and health officials. They operate out of trailers supplied by Santa 
Fe Springs, which also provides a small support staff. Funding comes from 
county departments and Supervisors Molina and Deane Dana, whose districts 
encompass the unincorporated area.  
</P>
<P>
 "The only thing we want to do is improve the quality of life" in the area, 
said Sgt. Mike Pippin, a Santa Fe Springs native who directs the deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The partnership was suggested by Marina Sueiro, director of governmental 
affairs for Santa Fe Springs. "It's really to the advantage of cities to help 
out (bordering) unincorporated areas," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at in a selfish way, you could say it is not profitable -- 
financially or politically. But that is short vision," Sueiro said. "If we 
allow county areas to deteriorate, it will have a negative effect on your 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 The unincorporated area surrounding Whittier is still wanting for better 
services, officials and community activists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "To a large degree it is still a forgotten neighborhood," said activist 
Ledesma. "We are still lacking direct services. We have a few but need others 
like . . . health services." 
</P>
<P>
 Along White Avenue in East Compton, it doesn't take much to get residents to 
talk about the lack of services in their community.  
</P>
<P>
 Resident Vaughn Holiday, for example, complains that garbage can go 
uncollected if residents leave more than two trash cans outside their home. 
"They take only two bags and leave the rest . . . and for two weeks they just 
leave it like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The county's Michael Mohajer expressed doubt that the county is not collecting 
garbage. "If it does happen and they let us know, we will take care of it, the 
same day," said Mohajer, assistant division engineer of the Department of 
Public Works. 
</P>
<P>
 East Compton residents have plenty of other complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (graffiti) writing has been on the walls for so long, I can't even tell 
you," Holiday said, as he and friend Brian Hall ticked off a list of how the 
neglect affects their neighborhood between Compton and the Long Beach Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirty streets. Overgrown trees. Above all, unsafe neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Because parking tickets are not issued even on days scheduled for street 
sweeping, the streets are often left strewn with trash, said Romiro Contreras. 
"No one tickets, so my wife has to go sweep up," said Contreras, 42. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Some local communities seem satisfied with their services, however. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hacienda Heights, for example, less than half that area's residents voted 
for cityhood two years ago -- making the community the first in a decade to 
reject incorporation in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of cityhood blamed the outcome on anti-government sentiment, but 
some opponents had a simpler explanation: Hacienda Heights was doing just fine 
as part of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar opposition to annexation has been voiced over the years in a small, 
unincorporated area straddling Long Beach and Lakewood. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no problem with (staying unincorporated) at all," said longtime 
resident Harriet Sherman, 65. "In fact, we fought like the devil to keep it 
unincorporated," she said, recalling how she and others beat back an annexation 
effort by Long Beach some 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never felt we were connected with what was going on in Long Beach," 
Sherman said. "Police and fire departments and things like that would be 
further away than now. We felt we were in just as good if not better position 
(for services) staying put." 
</P>
<P>
 For the foreseeable future, a lot of unincorporated areas may have no choice 
but to stay put, according to city and county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, they note, unincorporated areas have been largely working-class 
communities that did not have a big enough tax base to support their own 
cities. And now that the Southern California economy has been pummeled, the 
fortunes of many would-be cities remain in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also note that a recent change in state law makes it harder for 
those areas to make the case for cityhood. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 change, designed to stem the exodus of communities and tax dollars 
from California counties, says unincorporated areas achieving cityhood can only 
transfer over the tax dollars equal to the costs incurred by a new city. As 
such, backers of cityhood could have a hard time arguing that their area -- as 
a city -- would have much more money to work with if it left the county. 
Without such an argument, it could be tough persuading voters they have 
anything to gain from incorporation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the sentiment is there for cityhood, it still must face a vote. And 
just getting residents to put something before the electorate is a challenge. 
In South Whittier, for example, those talking about cityhood may find it tough 
to muster the thousands of dollars needed to place an incorporation drive 
before voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Unincorporated areas would also probably find it difficult to become part of 
existing cities. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unincorporated areas tend to be older and if they haven't been annexed by 
now, there is usually . . . some compelling reason," said Jim Colangelo, 
executive officer of Los Angeles County's Local Agency Formation Commission, 
which oversees annexations and incorporations. 
</P>
<P>
 So where does that leave unincorporated county areas? 
</P>
<P>
 Without much, according to Sunshine Acres' Redman. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are missing out on representation completely. All we get is generic lip 
service," he said. "If you had a city council, you could at least go to someone 
and get something done." Indeed, many county officials will admit privately 
that they would prefer to reside in a city rather than unincorporated areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone can -- or wants to -- live in cities, and officials say there 
is little doubt that unincorporated Los Angeles County will exist for some time 
to come. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the other reasons that communities reject cityhood or cities 
reject annexations, there is the issue of money. As the county's Colangelo 
notes, communities may not be excited about it, but they may be content to 
remain unincorporated unless counties dramatically cut services or impose fees. 
</P>
<P>
 As long as that doesn't happen, communities will probably settle for the 
status quo when offered a chance at cityhood or annexation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will say, 'Nah, let it stay the way it is,' " Colangelo said. 
Unincorporated Territory 
</P>
<P>
 Some areas rival cities in population. Some are only a few blocks long. Some 
are rich. Many are poor. But they have one thing in common. They're 
unincorporated areas, served by the goernment of Los Angeles County. Below, the 
map shows unincorporated areas in white.

 When Thomas Townsend was a struggling law student 30 years ago, police 
arrested him for failing to pay a traffic ticket. He called one of his 
professors, who helped him out of the jam. 
</P>
<P>
 "Later I said to him, 'I guess the only way to pay you back is to help 
somebody else out,' " Townsend recalled. "He gave me a look that said, 'Well, 
of course, that's it, stupid.' " 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Townsend decided to make good on his promise. He started a 
scholarship fund for college-bound seniors who live in Compton, Carson, 
Lynwood, Paramount and Willowbrook. The following year, six students received a 
total of $1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the fund awarded $16,000 to 31 students, mostly from low-income 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 "All these kids need money," said Townsend, 52, a Compton court commissioner 
since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Townsend donated $12,000. The rest came from judges in the Superior and 
Municipal courts in Compton, attorneys and the bar association. 
</P>
<P>
 "My home's paid for, my daughter's almost through college," said Townsend, who 
is paid about $100,000 a year. "I have no bills. My wife and I are happy. We 
have more than enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nice gesture for those of us who are blessed to give something back." 
</P>
<P>
 Scholarship recipients have attended Ivy League schools, along with public and 
private colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 An informal study of recipients shows that 90% of them either finished college 
or are still in school. Though there has been no formal follow-up of the 
students, Townsend said, he knows of scholarship winners who have gone into 
law, medicine, pharmacy, education and business. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students receive about $500, an award that "is not going to get these 
kids to college, but at least it helps them ease the burden," Townsend said. 
"It lets them know we want them to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend so many resources on kids that are destructive. I'd like to see the 
good kids get more attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Price, a 1993 Lynwood High School graduate and scholarship winner, 
finished his first year at Harvard University with A's and a B+. The 
scholarship helped him pay for books, supplies and travel expenses. Other 
scholarships, grants and loans help make up the rest of his tuition. "Every 
little bit helps," he said. 
</P>

 Townsend went to Price's high school graduation and the two see each other a 
few times a year. "You rarely find people willing to help and who are 
interested in what you're doing," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming years, Townsend said he hopes to expand the scholarship program 
so that more students receive larger awards. He also wants to launch a 
follow-up study of previous winners to see what they're doing now. 
</P>
<P>
 As for his debt to his former professor, Townsend said, "I think I've paid him 
back many times over."

 PYRAMID SCHEME 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets for Long Beach State men's basketball games at the Pyramid -- the new 
$19-million campus arena -- are a hot commodity. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers' home opener is against Detroit Mercy on Nov. 30, but school 
officials say ticket sales in the "gold" sections have surpassed the 50% mark. 
As of last week, 515 of the 1,024 seats in that section have been sold. 
</P>
<P>
 The total surpasses last season's mark of 490 in the on-campus Gold Mine gym 
and is the highest sales figure in more than two decades. The Pyramid will seat 
about 5,000 on opening night but is designed to eventually accommodate 7,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State also offers "platinum" and "silver" season ticket plans. 
Proceeds from the Pyramid's preferred seating package will benefit the 49er 
Athletic Assn. and its efforts to fund scholarships for all Long Beach State 
athletic programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's a look at the seating plans, which do not include the $185 cost for a 
season ticket: 
</P>
<P>
 * Platinum. It offers preferred parking and floor-level, chair-back courtside 
seating with table space and food service. An annual minimum donation of $2,449 
to the 49er Athletic Assn. is required for the first seat and $2,000 for each 
additional seat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold. It offers preferred parking and chair-back seating. An annual donation 
of $249 is required for the first seat and $200 for each additional seat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Silver. This level requires an annual donation of $149 and earns access to 
bleacher seating. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is also offering an All-Sports Pass for $300. The pass, available 
to alumni at $250, provides admission to all Long Beach home athletic events, 
including men's basketball. 
</P>
<P>

JUDGE UPHOLDS SANTA ANA CAMPING BAN; HOMELESS: CITY ORDINANCE IS AIMED 
SPECIFICALLY AT UNSIGHTLY ENCAMPMENTS AT CIVIC CENTER. CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYERS 
FEAR COUNTYWIDE REPERCUSSIONS FROM RULING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge Wednesday upheld a law banning camping 
at the Civic Center, although he recognized that the ordinance may leave 
homeless people with nowhere else to sleep in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still think the ordinance passes constitutional muster," Judge Robert J. 
Polis said as he issued his ruling in the latest battle between the city of 
Santa Ana and civil rights attorneys representing the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for the homeless said the judge's decision could have a sweeping and 
oppressive effect on homeless people in Orange County. They said officials in 
other cities may see the ruling as an opportunity to impose similar 
anti-camping restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I shudder at (the implications). This may be a green light for other cities 
wanting to make it a crime to be homeless," said attorney Christopher Mears, 
who represented the homeless in their lawsuit against the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation looks very grim for our clients," said Harry Simon, another 
attorney for the homeless, who works for the Legal Aid Society of Orange 
County. "They have no place where they can lawfully be in Santa Ana." 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Edward J. Cooper said city officials do not intend to banish the 
homeless, but merely want to stop them from setting up camp in the Civic 
Center. He said the ordinance is necessary to prevent the day-to-day business 
at the Civic Center from being disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some major problems there," Cooper said, citing health and safety 
concerns in the plaza because of the rickety tents, open fires and human waste 
that was left there. 
</P>
<P>
 The anti-camping law prohibits anything but "short-term casual sleeping" in 
the Civic Center area. Its passage was the city's second attempt at restricting 
homeless camping. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's first ordinance banned camping throughout the city, including the 
Civic Center. It was upheld by the Orange County Superior Court, but was later 
declared unconstitutional by the 4th District Court of Appeal and is currently 
being reviewed by the state Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys said Polis' ruling on the second ordinance may become moot if the 
Supreme Court finds the city's first anti-camping ordinance is constitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all waiting to see what happens in that case," Mears said. In the 
meantime, he said, he will likely appeal Polis' ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana officials have grappled with the homeless problem in their city for 
many years. Some officials have estimated that as many as 3,000 homeless people 
reside in Santa Ana, but others say that figure is too high. Currently, about 
330 shelter beds are available for the homeless in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1980s the city waged a highly controversial campaign to push the 
homeless out of the Civic Center. Many homeless people were arrested and some 
of their belongings were seized or destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper said that lawyers for the homeless have unfairly implied that it is the 
city's duty to provide land for the homeless to set up camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not aware of any such duty," he said. "If it's anyone's responsible then 
it's the County of Orange." 
</P>
<P>
 Simon, however, said the city does have responsibility "not to expel the 
homeless from the city" or "make it a crime for homeless people to live in 
every public space in the city." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the city's anti-camping law in the Civic Center, Simon said, 
his clients have been forced to sleep illegally in areas just outside of the 
Civic Center.  
</P>
<P>
 "They basically will continue to go anywhere they are not forced out of," 
Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the city's enforcement of the law has been "sporadic" and that 
he is aware of only half a dozen citations being given to homeless people.

SURVEY SHOWS BACKING FOR AIRPORT; MEASURE A: BARE MAJORITY NOW SUPPORTS THE 
PLAN FOR EL TORO, BUT OPPONENTS DON'T SEE STRENGTH IN THE NUMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Support for an initiative that would require a commercial airport at El Toro 
has increased to a bare majority of voters, but backing for Measure A is still 
soft even among proponents, according a UCI Orange County Annual Survey 
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey showed that support for the November ballot measure, which seeks to 
convert El Toro Marine Corps Air Station into a civilian airport, has grown 12 
points to 51% in three months among registered voters, while 33% oppose it. 
</P>
<P>
 A Times Orange County Poll in May showed that only 39% of 600 voters polled 
supported the measure, while 58% opposed it. The UCI telephone survey contacted 
812 registered voters and was done between Aug. 19-29. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryl Katz, who co-directed both polls by Mark Baldassare and Associates, 
said the results of the latest survey do not necessarily foretell passage of 
the measure, called the Orange County/El Toro Economic Stimulus Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Support for the initiative is still soft. Even people who say they've made up 
their mind in support of it are still not strongly decided on the question," 
said Katz.  
</P>
<P>
 The UCI poll showed that voters are still not convinced that building a 
commercial airport once the base is closed in 1999 because of federal cutbacks 
will reap an economic boon for Orange County, as promised by sponsors of the 
measure. Only 36% of voters polled strongly agreed that an airport at El Toro 
will create jobs and improve the county's economy, while 21% disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 24% strongly agreed that "a commercial airport at El Toro is the most 
fiscally sound use of the Marine air base," while 31% said they disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't a lot of people who have strong opinions on the impact of a 
commercial airport at El Toro," said Baldassare. 
</P>
<P>
 But sponsors of the initiative have benefited from growing support in north 
and central Orange County. The Times Orange County Poll in May showed only 42% 
of the voters in those areas said they would vote for the measure. The 39% 
approval rating was for countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCI poll showed that 57% of voters in north and central Orange County now 
say they would vote for the initiative. The countywide rate is 51%. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a significant number of undecided voters -- potentially the swing 
vote -- with 16% in the UCI poll, an increase over the 3% in The Times Orange 
County survey in May. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a slow start. We admit that. But I don't think that's a problem," 
said Garden Grove City Councilman Mark Leyes, a supporter of the initiative. ". 
. . We expect the support to continue growing in October, when people get their 
sample ballots and read the initiative." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Katz said there really "isn't a groundswell of support" for the 
measure. She said the UCI poll's 3.5% margin for error means that "there really 
isn't much of a majority support yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The poll also showed that Orange County remains polarized on the issue. In 
South County, 55% of voters polled said they would vote against the measure, 
while 57% in north and central Orange County would vote in favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake Forest Mayor Marcia Rudolph, who is against the initiative, said 
opponents in South County have the edge because "they are firm in their 
resolution to vote against the measure." She said that opposition in North 
County to Measure A will grow "when they realize there are still too many 
unanswered questions about the cost of an airport" at El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldassare said that the opponents' best tactic to defeat the measure is to 
"hammer away on the cost issue." 
</P>
<P>
 "Until people know how much this project is going to cost taxpayers, they can 
just as easily turn against it as they can turn for it," said Baldassare. 
"There's a lot of people whose opinions on the initiative are very fluid at 
this point." 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsors of the initiative need "to convince voters that the airport would 
create jobs and not cost taxpayers too much," Baldassare said. "At this point, 
both sides have yet to convince most voters of their claims." 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine City Councilman Barry J. Hammond, who opposes the initiative, said the 
measure may turn out to be a blessing in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really doesn't have a whole lot of support. If it fails, there won't be 
any more talking about an airport at El Toro," said Hammond. "From the 
beginning I've felt that even if we wanted an airport there, the best way to 
kill it is by putting the idea on the ballot. Exclusive of a few wealthy people 
who stand to profit from it, support for an airport is still very soft 
throughout the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Leyes said that airport supporters are encouraged by the results 
of the UCI poll. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's remarkable that we have 51% support throughout the county. But we still 
have a lot of work to do. We need to reinforce the belief that building an 
airport at El Toro will rebuild the economy in Orange County," Leyes said. 
Airport Measure Divides County 
</P>
<P>
 The ballot measure to designate El Toro for commercial aviation has scant 
majority support, but has divided the county geographically. Those in north and 
central Orange County more strongly support the airport while a majority of 
South County residents stand against it.At the heart of South County objections 
to a new airport are fears that it would create excessive noise and that the 
development would not be a fiscally sound decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Measure A on the Orange County ballot would designate the El Toro Marine 
Corps. Air Station for civil aviation and related purposes. If the election
