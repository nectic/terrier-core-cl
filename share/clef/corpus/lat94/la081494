 About a quarter of the way through John Gregory Dunne's "Playland," we find 
ourselves at the Copacabana in its late 1940s heyday. Walter Winchell is 
sitting at his usual table, slyly eyeing the assembled semi-sophisticates and 
making copious notes. Helen O'Connell has just finished a sultry rendition of 
"I Like the Likes of You," singing directly at Jacob King, a good-looking 
gangster celebrating the fact that he has just beaten a murder conviction. Then 
Blue Tyler makes her entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 Poured into a black evening gown, draped with a red fox fur, the now teen-age 
former child star sashays into the club with a small army of bodyguards, 
publicists and boyfriend of the moment, Arthur French, in tow: 
</P>
<P>
 "She smiled and waved at the photographers, their cameras loving her and she 
loving their cameras in turn, the cameras wiping the teen-age sulkiness from 
her face, Blue always in motion, posing, vamping, cooing, 'I'd walk a mile for 
a man who walked a mile for a Camel.' Joe Romagnola, the maitre d', produced a 
cigarette, offering a light from his silver Tiffany lighter, a gift from Frank, 
who when he played the Paramount gave Tiffany lighters to all the maitre d's at 
all the gin mills where he drank, and Arthur French just as quickly removed the 
cigarette from her mouth. 'J. F. says you're too young to smoke in public,' he 
said, and Blue said, 'I'm too young to do a lot of the things I do with you, 
Arthur, in public and especially in private, it's called statutory something, 
isn't it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 This is first-rate pop fiction writing: tart, evocative, nicely observed. Real 
people are crammed cheek by jowl alongside imaginary characters. Cameras, 
cigarettes and pocket lighters are brought to eerily animate life. And the 
words sprint lightly across the page thanks to a generous sprinkling of commas 
keeping each thought, feeling and texture tumbling along easily one after the 
other. You can find any number of well-written scenes throughout "Playland's" 
494 pages. The question is: Are well-written scenes enough? 
</P>
<P>
 With "Playland," Dunne has set out to write the end-all Hollywood novel. It's 
his full-throttle, damn-the-torpedoes try at toppling "The Last Tycoon," "What 
Makes Sammy Run?" and "The Day of the Locust" from the literary pedestals that 
have held them for so long. But for all the verbal flash that makes it such an 
enjoyable read, it's no match for the likes of Fitzgerald, Schulberg and West. 
You can only coast on the surface for so long before a reader begins to hanker 
for some depth. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playland's" principal setting is Hollywood in the 1940s; a period Dunne 
rightly regards as the most fascinating in movie history. The studio system was 
operating at top speed. The power and influence of the images it created were 
reaching millions worldwide. Yet at the same time, that system was beginning to 
come apart at the seams. Industrywide strikes had led to an unholy alliance 
between moguls and mobsters, so desperate were the studios to break the unions' 
backs. The anti-Communist witch hunts of the blacklist era soon followed, 
bringing with it further demoralization and depletion of valuable human 
resources. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Playland's" acknowledgments, Dunne pays lavish tribute to the late 
writer-director Philip Dunne for his memoir "Take Two" ("essential to any 
understanding of the period") and Neal Gabler's classic study, "An Empire of 
Their Own: How the Jews Invented Hollywood" ("the best book about Hollywood I 
have ever read"). But, being a novel, "Playland" is less interested in the dry 
facts of history than the ways that fiction can engage a reader's imagination 
to make those facts come alive. And the means Dunne has chosen is pastiche: a 
real Hollywood with an imaginary star named Blue Tyler placed at its center. 
</P>
<P>
 With her shockingly adult voice and manner (much like child star Mitzi Green), 
Blue is a sensation in the 1930s. But by the mid-'40s her studio, Cosmopolitan 
Pictures (the actual name of the studio William Randolph Hearst built for 
Marion Davies), is beginning to wonder whether she'll be able to make the 
transition to adult roles (see Deanna Durbin and Judy Garland). Her 
uncontrollably foul mouth (see Louise Brooks, Frances Farmer, Carole Lombard) 
and her sensationally public affair with gangster Jacob King (see Bugsy Siegel 
and Virginia Hill), make her a studio publicist's nightmare. On top of that, 
Blue gets into hot water when she testifies before the House Un-American 
Activities Committee (shades of Dorothy Comingore) and comes to the defense of 
her favorite director Chuckie O'Hara; a one-legged, gay ex-Marine who joined 
the Communist party out of love for a screenwriter (there's been loose talk 
that this is George Cukor, but Dunne more likely created the character from an 
admixture of Mitchell Leisen, Edmund Goulding and Irving Rapper). Blue makes 
the blacklist herself as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a career nose dive seems to be in the cards for Blue regardless, for 
following a string of bad marriages (Arlene Judge), worse Italian movies 
(Carroll Baker) and low-paying jobs (Veronica Lake), she finds herself out of 
show business and "off the planet": an alcoholic wreck (Lillian Roth) living in 
a trailer park (Evelyn Brent) on the outskirts of Hamtramck, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is par for the course for Hollywood novels: the seamy underside of 
the "dream factory" cocktailed up through a bittersweet mixture of glamour and 
sleaze. What Dunne adds to the usual stew are "Forrest Gump"-like flights of 
fancy: 
</P>
<P>
 "(Here's) a photo of Blue at age 10 receiving from Clark Gable that special 
Oscar at the 1939 Academy Awards. Another of Blue giving Eleanor Roosevelt a 
contribution to the March of Dimes. . . . (Blue) with Harold Arlen and Irving 
Berlin both penning Tyler songfests. . . . Blue being comforted by Norma 
Shearer outside the Wilshire Boulevard Temple where she was 'the youngest 
mourner at the funeral of Beloved Industry Legend Irving Thalberg' . . . 
weeping at the news that Carole Lombard's plane had crashed in Table Rock, 
Nevada, outside Las Vegas, killing everyone on board. 'Blue misses fatal 
flight,' read the caption headline." 
</P>
<P>
 This is very clever stuff; catnip for lovers of movies lore. But while Dunne 
brings 1940s Hollywood to vivid life, his heroine remains more a conceit than a 
character. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playland" is narrated by Jack Broderick, the central figure of Dunne's 1987 
Kennedyesque family saga "The Red White & Blue." A down-on-his-luck 
screenwriter, he hopes to turn Blue's story into a novel that will be bought as 
the basis for a screenplay -- which he will also write. And so Broderick sets 
out to interview not only the faded star, but everyone who ever knew her, 
directly or indirectly. As Blue's story spills out "Citizen Kane"-style, the 
testimony of aged studio heads, sleazy police informers, Hollywood has-beens 
and assorted mobsters slowly builds up the notion that her life history is of 
earth-shattering importance. But at the end of the day, it's hard to imagine 
how the petty travails of a small-minded, mean-spirited, foul-mouthed, 
self-obsessed nymphomaniac can be seen as typifying Hollywood as a whole. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunne's mistake is letting his love of tough-guy prose and show biz cynicism 
get the better of him. For the greatest of Hollywood stars weren't libertines 
like Blue, but hypocrites who believed -- and promoted -- every one of the 
pristine images the studio manufactured for them, even while living wildly 
contradictory lives behind closed doors. Or, to put it another way, Joan 
Crawford was a madwoman who thought she was Joan Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely, Dunne seems to be aware of the limitations of his premise, for in 
the novel's last quarter, he abandons Blue's story and shifts to an 
investigation of the unsolved murder of her "best pal," a "non-pro" named Meta 
Dierdorf. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was odd, even obscene, looking at old forensic photographs of a naked dead 
nineteen-year-old who if she were still alive would be close to seventy, with 
all the attendant miseries and complaints of old age and failed expectation." 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing odd, however, about Dunne's fascination with an old forensic 
photo. We've been here before -- in "True Confession," Dunne's spin on the 
"Black Dahlia" case. But there's a harsher undertone this time: 
</P>
<P>
 "Meta Dierdorf was not a pretty sight in her bathtub. Her face was battered, 
her nose bloodied, her lips puffed and split, her breasts bare and bruised. On 
the side of the tub, there were smeared traces of excrement, indicating that as 
she was dying her sphincter had loosened and that she had evacuated her bowels. 
. ." 
</P>
<P>
 The reader doesn't arrive at this passage unprepared. From Blue Tyler's 
sardonic recollections of almost dying in an emergency room, to an underworld 
informer's grotesque descriptions of a series of gangland slayings, Dunne's 
novel is a virtual catalogue raisonnee of physical revulsion and misanthropic 
disgust. Sexual couplings are minutely described, but the pleasures of 
lovemaking are passed over in silence. The four-letter word for intercourse is 
used constantly -- but primarily as a weapon of verbal violence. And in one 
indelible scene we're served a description, in exhaustive detail, of Jacob King 
engaged in a fit of excessive vomiting. 
</P>
<P>
 Attraction/repulsion to corporeal existence is nothing new to serious 
literature. A bit more reserve, and Dunne's meditation on Meta Dierdorf's 
corpse would bear comparison with the clinical cool of J. G. Ballard; a few 
more kinks, and it could be right out of one of William Burroughs' pornographic 
vaudevilles; more passion could invoke parallels with the Nietzschean 
melancholia of Georges Bataille; more excess, the Marquis de Sade. The problem 
is, unlike the authors of "Crash," "The Wild Boys," "Blue of Noon" and "The 120 
Days of Sodom," Dunne hasn't owned up to his own morbidity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playland" is supposed to be a novel about Hollywood. But it doesn't take an 
expert in textual analysis to discover a very different piece of writing 
beneath its slick roman a clef surface. Not quite fiction, not quite cri de 
coeur confession, this "other kind" of book overflowing with inchoate gushes of 
bile, has absolutely nothing to do with the movies. In fact, the closer you 
look at "Playland," the more obvious it appears that Dunne is using Hollywood 
as a mechanism of denial. Plainly, for all his showbiz savvy, Dunne is far more 
comfortable at the morgue than at the movies.

 Thank you for publishing the fine short stories that appeared in your New 
California Fiction issue (July 17). The short story is my cherished favorite of 
all fiction forms and is, as you know, hard to find in mainstream magazines.I 
hope you discover a large audience for this quality fiction so you can continue 
publishing it. I was particularly impressed by "Color Struck" (by Alyce 
Miller).

 Recently my neighbor drove away while a little cat was playing underneath her 
car. The cat fell onto the road horribly injured. I picked it up, drove it to a 
local veterinarian and paid $25 to have it put out of its pain. This was an 
awful experience for me. I also don't need, when relaxing with my Sunday paper, 
to see an illustration like the one that accompanied the story about the dead 
cat ("Bad Luck With Cats," by Cris Mazza). 
</P>
<P>
 For those of us who are too aware of the insensitivities of the world, 
couldn't the magazine find more uplifting, inspiring works to showcase? Instead 
we get a supposedly trendy, hip illustration laced with sophomoric humor and a 
harshly written story.

REVISION, WITH A VENGEANCE; SCHOLAR DETAILS BRECHT AS AN UNSCRUPULOUS 
PLAGIARIST WHO SEDUCED ALL HE MET INTO DOING HIS BIDDING -- AND HIS WRITING; 
PART OF THIS IS ATTRIBUTED TO HIS VIRTUOSITY IN THE BEDROOM; BRECHT & COMPANY; 
SEX, POLITICS, AND THE MAKERS OF THE MODERN DRAMA BY JOHN FUEGI , (GROVE PRESS: 
$32.50; 621 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Lee Wochner, Lee Wochner is a Los Angeles playwright and Artistic Director 
of Moving Arts, a theater he helped found. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though major artists routinely come in for critical tarrings, never has one 
fared so badly and so deservedly at the hands of a biographer as Bertolt Brecht 
does now. With "Brecht & Company," Brecht scholar John Fuegi shatters all our 
assumptions about the premier theatrical artist of the 20th Century, including 
the notion that Brecht actually wrote his own works. 
</P>
<P>
 Brecht's importance to 20th-Century theatre cannot be overstated. His operas 
and plays champion alienation the way Kafka epitomizes anxiety. Characters 
confront audience members, move their own props or break into rough song -- all 
on an epic scale as Brecht works to snuff out Ibsen and Stanislavsky and their 
"realistic" drama. Brecht combines text, balladry, stagecraft, imagery, 
movement and spoken word in a way now associated with performance art. 
Audiences are led to think rather than feel, or, if they must feel, it should 
be horror at the mirror held up to them from the stage. 
</P>
<P>
 These by now familiar devices are evident in the work of playwrights as 
seemingly unrelated as Tony Kushner, John Steppling and Reza Abdoh and 
directors such as Peter Brook, Robert Wilson and Peter Sellars. Rarely a day 
goes by that critics do not describe something odd and disturbing as 
"Brechtian." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, as Fuegi shows in punishing detail, Brecht himself had little to do 
with the writing of his major works. This includes masterpieces known around 
the world, such as "The Threepenny Opera," "The Caucasian Chalk Circle," 
"Mother Courage" and "The Good Woman of Setzuan." Despite his purposely shabby 
dress, unwashed stench, rotting teeth and icy persona, Brecht was some sort of 
modern Mesmer, able to hypnotize almost everyone he met into doing his bidding 
-- and his writing. Part of this may have been his virtuosity in the bedroom. 
He often kept several regular mistresses; when he fled Nazi Germany he left 
with not only his wife and two children, but two other women, both of whom were 
actively writing plays for him in exchange for promises of marriage or, even 
sadder, sometimes just an occasional dollop of attention. 
</P>
<P>
 The saddest case is that of Margaret Steffin, a young German writer from the 
provinces who had the misfortune to fall under Brecht's spell at an early age. 
Fuegi shows that Steffin, who suffered a lengthy decline from tuberculosis as 
she toiled ceaselessly for her thoughtless master, was almost single-handedly 
responsible for "Courage" and "Setzuan," as well as "Galileo," early drafts of 
"Chalk Circle," at least four other major plays, a novel and countless poems 
and stories, all published solely under Brecht's name. This was despite the 
obvious questions raised by his inability to read French or any other of the 
languages of the source material for these works, or the fact that all of the 
manuscripts are in the handwriting of Steffin. At most, Brecht served as editor 
to this work, sometimes contributing 10% of the actual writing. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Steffin, she was left behind to die anonymously in a Moscow TB ward 
after arranging Brecht's safe passage to America. He mourned for four days and 
then promptly swindled her family out of her royalties and all inheritance. 
While Brecht became a millionaire, secretly depositing thousands of gold marks 
in a Swiss bank account, Steffin's family was left to beg for enough money to 
buy a down comforter. 
</P>
<P>
 There is little doubt that in person Brecht was a magnetic personality to all 
and sundry. Fuegi's descriptions of a young Brecht performing his own songs 
cabaret-style in 1920's Germany betokens a young Elvis Presley: 
</P>
<P>
 "In secretary or business tycoon, male of female, knees weakened and 
inhibitions slipped away as Brecht, in his favorite performing stance, stood 
above them on a table at bars, brothels, or fashionable apartments . . . With 
his feet spread apart, guitar pressed close to his crotch, almost concave belly 
thrust forward, he made the animal-gut strings howl to back up his high, 
scratchy voice. People came and saw and heard and were conquered." 
</P>
<P>
 Exiled in Los Angeles during World War II, Brecht worked his charms most 
successfully on Charles Laughton, who put up half the money for a production of 
"Galileo," in which Laughton then starred, and on various film producers who 
paid him for hack-work jobs on other people's scripts. No less than W. H. Auden 
was seduced into working on "Brecht" manuscripts. Brecht in person was so 
persuasive he was even able to gull the House Committee on Un-American 
Activities into believing that he was nothing more than an absent-minded 
playwright who had never been a Communist and who rarely associated with them. 
This was while the world-famous Brecht had a tacit agreement with Stalin 
whereby he would receive a regular stipend in exchange for his silence about 
the dictator's slaughter of millions. 
</P>
<P>
 If Brecht's treatment of Steffin was tragic -- she was clearly a world-class 
writer whose life could have been spared with regular medical treatment, 
treatment Brecht surely could afford -- his complicity with Stalin is 
monstrous. It was also of a pattern. Brecht said nothing against Hitler during 
his rise, and only after he had fled Germany did he unearth sheaves of poems 
"proving" that he had opposed the madman all along. When Brecht needed safe 
transport through the Soviet Union so that he could escape to America, he 
assured Stalin's agents that he would never utter a word against the murderous 
regime. This was even though he was by now fully aware that Stalin's killing 
machine had consumed scores of his own friends and lovers. (The Soviet Union 
later repaid Brecht by installing him as the head of the Berliner Ensemble in 
East Germany, where the dramatist of the workers lived like royalty and treated 
his hundreds of employees like chattel.) 
</P>
<P>
 Space does not permit a full list of Brecht's unscrupulous acts, stretching as 
they do through his entire lifetime until his death in 1956. Suffice it to say, 
he rode roughshod over everyone he met, from composer and partner Kurt Weill 
(Brecht routinely resold "The Threepenny Opera," which had over 10,000 
productions in its first five years, without reporting any earnings to Weill) 
to activist-writer Ruth Berlau. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, somehow, he got away with it all. No one's services were ever 
recognized or repaid, and only death allowed an escape from his spell. Even 
Elizabeth Hauptmann, who is shown to be the actual author of many of Brecht's 
poems and early plays, returned to his employ after an absence of 20 years. 
After breaking away from Brecht, she had found it nearly impossible to publish 
under her own name, especially since all her best work had been internationally 
established as having been his. 
</P>
<P>
 It is difficult to imagine any writer so gladly creating one masterpiece after 
another in complete anonymity and with no hope of future income, as did 
Steffin, Hauptmann and Berlau. Even more so than death, writers fear being 
plagiarized. But Fuegi's 25 years of research have unearthed a wealth of 
corroboration, and he backs this searing portrait of artist as monster with 
extensive footnotes. Perhaps if Brecht were indeed the major artist we had 
assumed, his actions might be somewhat more forgivable; arrogance is often a 
requirement for genius. But as Fuegi deflates Brecht's stature, he 
correspondingly forces us all to hold him more accountable. 
</P>
<P>
 Brecht himself once said, "What I don't like to admit is that I myself have 
contempt for the unfortunate." That his meteoric rise in Weimar, Germany, 
reflected the prevailing attitudes of the time should come as no surprise. 
Brecht was not the only German theatre artist with similar feelings. A would-be 
set designer of similar outlook, who was unfortunately not hired for a Brecht 
production, later went on to even greater fame and fortune. His name was Adolf 
Hitler.

SEPARATING THE MEN FROM THE BOYS

<TEXT>
<P>
 As an employee in the Hospitality Industry, I must chide S. Irene Virbila for 
her woefully outdated terminology ("The Drive Way," Restaurants, July 24). Does 
she realize, when mentioning the "busboy," that these workers are often grown 
men, many with wives and children? I find "busman" or "busser" to be far more 
appropriate. The era in which people referred to adults as "boys" is one I'm 
sure we all hope has long since come to a close.

 In response to Raul E. Acosta's letter (July 17), about Dr. Eva Carrizales and 
the death of her infant patient ("By a Doctor's Hand," by Barry Siegel, June 
12), I take issue with his statement, "As a Christian nation, it is our duty to 
uphold the idea that all life is sacred, and that we are to preserve it to the 
very last second." 
</P>
<P>
 First, who declared our nation to be a Christian one? What an insult to the 
citizens of this country who are of other religious persuasions. 
</P>
<P>
 And does the preservation of life to the very last second apply to those in 
the gas chamber or in the electric chair?

MORE ON GENE SCOTT . . . 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing in response to "Pay 'N' Save," about televangelist Gene Scott 
(July 10). Glenn F. Bunting did a great job exposing Scott's financial 
sins.However, he accepted without question that Scott is something of a 
biblical authority and scholar, a concept I seriously question. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that Scott knows some words in Hebrew, Greek and German scarcely 
qualifies him as a scholar. The piece quoted several words used by Scott along 
with his translations of them. But actually those words have a variety of 
meanings depending on the context of the biblical writer and the sentence in 
which they appear. Hagyois, or sainthood, can also mean separate from common 
conditions, hallowed, holy or sanctity. Dike, or righteousness, can mean right, 
justice, punishment or judgment. And Logos, or word, can refer to Jesus Christ, 
the Old Testament, speaking or reason. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Scott does not fare well considered against the teachings of James 5 or 
Jesus teaching on the Widows Mite. Both have a real problem with wealth and the 
way Scott abuses it. Bunting should have named Scott's empire for what it is -- 
a cult.

WHAT REMAINS IS SILENCE; NOBEL PRIZE-WINNER CZESLAW MILOSZ MEDITATES ON THE 
HUMAN DESIRE TO LEAVE BEHIND A MARK OF OUR EXISTENCE; A YEAR OF THE HUNTER, BY 
CZESLAW MILOSZ TRANSLATED FROM THE POLISH BY MADELINE G. LEVINE (FARRAR, STRAUS 
& GIROUX: $25; 288 PP.)

<P>
By Ian Buruma, Ian Buruma's latest book, The Wages of Guilt, is about memories 
of World War II in Germany and Japan. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first thing one should know about the poet Czeslaw Milosz is that he was 
born in a country that no longer exists. Milosz's Wilno (Vilnius) is, as he 
puts it, "Atlantis." He saw the end of two countries, first czarist Russia, 
then independent Lithuania. And although the latter nation has been reborn, it 
is not the country Milosz knew: The Jews are gone, and so, by and large, are 
the Poles. All that is left are scattered memories, in the minds of old women 
and men, and books. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Isaac Bashevis Singer's stories of prewar Poland, Milosz's literature is 
an attempt to recreate Atlantis, as it were, in poetry and memoirs. The book at 
hand, written in the form of a diary kept between August, 1987, and August, 
1988, is a wonderful addition to his other autobiographical writing. The diary 
form, free-floating, wide-ranging, but at the same time condensed and 
disciplined, is suited to a poet, especially an intellectual poet, like Milosz. 
He refers to his kinship with Singer at the beginning. Both are writers from 
lost worlds, and both have seen too much of the devil's work to feel 
comfortable with God's words. Milosz says he feels more akin to Singer than to 
any other writer: "Nobel prizes for two alienated men." 
</P>
<P>
 Loss, displacement and alienation mark almost every sentence in Milosz's 
diary. It seems right that many of the notes were written on board airplanes, 
bound for such places as Boise or Cedar Rapids. 
</P>
<P>
 They were written nowhere, en route to somewhere. Some of the notes, on the 
other hand, are written at home, in the Berkeley Hills. Even then, the sense of 
uprootedness creeps in. On Aug. 12, 1987, he plants bougainvillea in his 
garden: "It is delicate and doesn't transplant easily. The one I bought . . . 
last year in the old city of Menton was sickly for a long time; it lost its 
leaves." 
</P>
<P>
 "A Year of the Hunter" is not just the diary of an uprooted man, but also of 
an old man. Much of the book is taken up by reflections on mortality and 
immortality: What will last? Which poems will still be read by future 
generations? What happens to memories when their keepers die? Even though he 
does not hide his vanity -- the Nobel prize looms largely in his pages -- his 
memoirs are not at all self-obsessed. Milosz's autobiography consists largely 
of the biography of others. He writes beautifully about absent friends. Like 
the recreation of his Lithuanian Atlantis, these biographies are an attempt to 
preserve life before it is gone: "One after the other, those with whom one can 
speak about the absent die, and what remains is silence." 
</P>
<P>
 In a sense, all art is an attempt to leave footprints in the flow of time. 
Milosz's art is also an attempt to fill the silence left by the dead. Several 
times he refers to "some realm that stores everything that has ever been 
experienced." He feels the need to be "somehow a part of God's thoughts when he 
observes the world, a need for perfect objectivity, for a sphere that endures 
independently of people's fleeting interconnections." If he were a simple 
believer, in God, and Heaven, this would not be a problem. The problem is that 
he cannot be a simple believer. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he quotes a Polish skeptic, Karol Ludwik Koninski, who exemplified 
the strivings of "metaphysical not-quite-believers." Milosz is a metaphysical 
not-quite-believer. He would like to believe that the present Pope is a 
spiritual Polish king, who lifted his people "out of their collective 
degradation." And yet he distrusts the bearer of messianic messages. Milosz 
grew up as a Polish Lithuanian. He was nurtured by the language of Polish 
poets. Yet he distrusts the "elevated spiritual rhetoric" of Polish 
nationalism. This is the rhetoric of the great national poets, Adam Mickiewicz 
and Cyprian Norwid, and also of Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
 A secularist, a skeptic, a humanist, Milosz can find common ground only with 
"demonized Poles": Jews, Marxists, atheists and so on. Milosz himself was a 
Marxist once. He represented Communist Poland after the war as a diplomat in 
Paris. He gives several reasons for serving a cause he came to detest. The need 
for belonging, for recognition inside a national community, was one reason. 
Perhaps his stated desire for a code of discipline, a "higher order," rules 
that "exist in order to exist," offers another explanation. But the main reason 
he supported Marxist internationalism was that it appeared to be the only 
alternative to narrow Polish nationalism. As he observes about the typical 
nationalist Polish writer: "It is curious that when he wants to serve his 
nation with his mind, his pen, his art, his achievements are flawed in direct 
proportion to his national fervor." 
</P>
<P>
 Milosz's distrust of elevated spiritual rhetoric is matched by his dislike of 
psychoanalysis. He reflects, philosophizes and questions, but he does not want 
to put himself on the couch, so to speak. He is "aware that a lot of things are 
happening in the depths," but prefers "not to look." But this, too, is perhaps 
a mark of the "not quite believer." For he does wish to reveal himself -- 
otherwise, why bother to publish a diary? What he reveals is a man of several 
contradictory personalities: a disciplinarian (to himself), as well as a 
drinker and a flirt; a modest man who revels in applause; a private man who 
adores to perform in public; a secularist, and a man of the flesh haunted by 
spiritual questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Milosz is obsessed by the division of body and soul. People 
write poetry, engage in trade or politics, observe customs and rituals, and 
worship in churches -- "Yet they have to rush to the toilet every minute to 
empty their bladder or take a crap." Milosz writes that if Beatrice "remained a 
spirit for Dante, it was only because he was married not to Beatrice, but to 
another woman." 
</P>
<P>
 Poetry, then, would be a way for the man of the flesh, for the not quite 
believer, to enter the world of the spirit, or "God's thoughts," or "the sphere 
that endures." It is also the answer to the spiritual void left by the slow 
death of God. Here Milosz's thoughts are close to many writers of our Secular 
Age, not just Singer, but V. S. Naipaul, too. Milosz wonders how people should 
behave "in the face of ultimate things," such as the death of people close to 
them. The liturgy and rituals of religion would be a help. But what if the 
liturgy of organized religion loses its meaning? "Couldn't poetry be the 
liturgy of a substitute religion?" 
</P>
<P>
 It is a romantic notion, expressed by an anti-romantic man. But there is 
something to it. Poems, some poems, passed on from generation to generation, do 
endure. People die. Memories fade. Countries cease to exist. But we still have 
the books. For that we should be grateful.

NOT FOR THE SQUEAMISH; DON'T READ THIS OVER A MEAL -- WE'RE SERIOUS; 
CONVERSATIONS WITH THE CANNIBALS: THE END OF THE OLD SOUTH PACIFIC, BY MICHAEL 
KRIEGER (THE EC C O PRESS: $23; 291 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alexander Frater, Alexander Frater was born in Vanuatu, in the Southwest 
Pacific. He is chief travel correspondent of the London Observer; his book 
Chasing the Monsoon is published by Owl Books. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My father, a doctor in the South Seas, once ate human flesh. Back in the 1930s 
he had called on a remote Big Namba village on the Vanuatu island of Malekula. 
(Namba is the term for a penis gourd, rival tribes being known by the 
dimensions of these accessories; the Big Nambas were given to more aggressive 
fashion statements than their modest rivals, the Small Nambas.) He found a 
feast in progress and had meat pressed upon him. Pig, his hosts said, but this 
stuff possessed a sweetish, faintly cloying taste unlike any pork he had 
sampled before. It took him only a moment to guess its origins -- confirmed by 
the evasive looks and nervous laughter of his hosts. After being violently ill 
he left hurriedly and, for years afterward, was too traumatized to talk about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody has been cooked and consumed on Malekula since World War II yet, so 
ferocious was its reputation that even today, half a century later, it is still 
regarded as the People-Eating Capital of the World. When I came upon Michael 
Krieger's new book I knew, with absolute certainty, that he had been there and 
met with the Big Nambas. And so it proved. 
</P>
<P>
 Four toothless old men gave him a remarkably frank interview. They described 
tying their victims to a tall wooden slit drum and beating them with heavy 
clubs, continuing long after life was extinct; the objective was to smash the 
bones and tenderize the meat -- though certain small bones from the hand were 
preserved to be sharpened later and made into spear tips. The heads were cut 
off and thrown away, as were the intestines, heart and liver. The edible parts 
were wrapped in banana leaves and left to steam gently, overnight, in an earth 
oven. A single victim, traditionally served up with a batter of crushed yams 
called laplap, could be expected to feed 10 warriors; though women did the 
cooking they were not entitled to share the feast. Perhaps by way of 
compensation women, on Malekula, were not eaten. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, though, they were. Krieger undertook a long trek to meet "the only 
surviving practitioner of cannibalism in the Solomons." Timothy, over 100 years 
old and almost blinded by trachoma, nevertheless possesses a serenity that 
impresses Krieger. He is also extremely forthright about the culinary habits of 
his youth. The dead victims, he says, were left four days before being 
barbecued. The limbs provided good eating though Timothy, closely questioned in 
a decidedly lip-smacking manner by Krieger, states, "Best place is the women, 
their nipples." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes?" murmurs Mr. Krieger, perplexed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Breast." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, the breast!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Very greasy," Timothy adds with relish. He is referring to the amount of fat 
contained in breast tissue. Because of the low fat content of their diet, any 
fat is considered a great delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the only cannibals we hear from. Yet their testimony so impressed 
Krieger that they managed to hijack his title, if not his book -- most of which 
is about Pacific Islanders who eat nothing more sinister than chicken, fish, 
fruit, vegetables and canned bully beef. (Though the last -- named, during my 
island childhood -- was said to be favored by old cannibals for its haunting 
resemblance to human meat; acting like a kind of Proustian trigger, it evoked 
memories of carefree nights around the campfire chewing juicy tenderloin of old 
Eddie Whatshisname from over the swamp.) 
</P>
<P>
 His is the latest in a small but welcome crop of books on the South Pacific. 
It follows Julian Evans' splendid "Transit of Venus" and Paul Theroux's huge, 
ill-tempered and vastly entertaining "The Happy Isles of Oceania." Both these 
writers chose to make long, discursive sweeps through numerous island groups, 
covering great distances and producing big-canvas accounts. Krieger is more of 
a miniaturist, homing in on a handful of isolated communities, taking up 
temporary residence and observing everything in intricate -- and, at times, 
obsessive -- detail. 
</P>
<P>
 He visits Palmerston in the Cook Islands, settled in 1863 by an itinerant 
Englishman named William Marsters. Marsters and his three wives produced 20 
children, 2,500 grand and great-grandchildren, a further 3,000 great-great 
grandchildren. That was according to a census published almost 50 years ago; by 
now his direct descendants could probably populate a city the size of, say, 
Auckland, New Zealand. Only 60 or so actually live on the island today, led by 
a mysterious man of the cloth, the Rev. Bill Marsters, who runs the place like 
a personal fiefdom, tyrannically exploiting his fellows; certain scenes here 
remind one of Conrad's "Heart of Darkness." 
</P>
<P>
 In Vanuatu he meets members of the John Frum sect, founded in the belief that 
Frum, "King of the USA," would one day fly in laden with dollars and Western 
consumer durables. (Today the Frummers, grown more sophisticated, no longer 
crawl "under an aeroplane to determine its gender.") In Tuvalu, one of the 
world's poorest countries, he finds a society that is virtually crime-free. 
1987, the last year for which records were available, saw 11 thefts reported 
nationwide. Unemployment may run at a staggering 89%, yet the good-humored, 
tranquil Tuvaluans exist in a state of grace that is starting to attract the 
envious attention of the outside world; Krieger tells us that foreigners are 
now trying to persuade Tuvaluan families to adopt them and thus provide instant 
citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 The book's high point is a journey, remarkable by any standards, through a 
mountainous island in the Solomons to meet the Kwaio, a tribe once regarded as 
the most dangerous and duplicitous in the British Empire. Kwaio means "I will 
kill you" and that is what, as recently as 1987, they were still doing to 
trespassers in their Stone Age domain. Even the Solomon Islands police must 
seek permission from the Kwaio to enter; usually, it's refused. The tribe have 
been outcasts for much of the century, and plainly, elect to remain so today. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Krieger went to see them, surviving a hair-raising trek to 
arrive at a small village where they smoke graceful metal pipes fashioned from 
parts of a crashed World War II Japanese fighter and, to the distress of white 
missionaries -- who don't dare come near them -- go in for robust 
devil-worship. Yet the Kwaio turned out to be welcoming and amiable and, 
surprisingly, scrupulous payers of taxes; each adult male, though dirt poor, 
contributes $4 annually to the Solomons' exchequer. Their bitterness at being 
ignored by a government which, plainly, remains wary of them, is palpable. They 
want schools, hospitals, experts to advise on agriculture; at the same time 
they wish their culture to be left intact. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a dilemma confronting very few South Pacific tribes today. Most have 
already had their cultures hijacked and reduced to sterile song-and-dance shows 
for the tourists. Krieger agonizes over this and, endearingly, does what he can 
to help. He and a companion dispense medicines, teach the Kwaio to count (using 
the numbers on a wristwatch -- itself an astounding thing never before seen by 
the Kwaio), teach them the alphabet, even teach a chief to write his own name. 
</P>
<P>
 Krieger has written an earnest, emotional, well-intentioned book containing, 
it must be said, few laughs. But for anyone who has visited that huge, 
beguiling tract of the globe and wondered about the blue islands that always 
remain on the horizon -- the anonymous ones at which the cruise ships never 
call -- it will provide a surprising and fascinating read.

COVER STORY: CLEAR AND FUTURE DANGER; THE PLOT IN HBO'S 'ENEMY WITHIN' PUTS THE 
U.S. ON A PRECIPICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN KING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thirty years ago, John Frankenheimer's political thriller "Seven Days in May" 
sent chills down moviegoers' spines. The film, which starred Kirk Douglas, Burt 
Lancaster and Fredric March, presented a grimly realistic depiction of a 
planned military coup of the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, HBO hopes viewers will be glued to their seats with its latest original 
movie, "The Enemy Within," a thriller based on "Seven Days in May." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a suspense film," explains producer Robert Papazian. "I think that it 
has something to say -- that what we take for granted in today's society is our 
freedom and democracy. We think it is a given. But I think this explores the 
fragile part of that (belief). I think it strengthens our beliefs in our 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 Set a few years in the future, "The Enemy Within" finds the United States' 
military power on the wane. Budgets have been cut and so has the military's 
influence. The military is not happy with its diminished role, believing the 
Armed Forces could not fight a major war if called upon. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States also has many enemies in the scenario: Iraq and Iran are now 
allies; North Korea is threatening to use its nuclear bombs. The President (Sam 
Waterston) is trying to maintain peace, but his Administration is shaky. In the 
midst of this crisis, Col. Mac Casey (Forest Whitaker), an officer with the 
Joint Chiefs of Staff, discovers a Pentagon plot, led by his commanding officer 
Gen. Lloyd (Jason Robards), to overthrow the government. 
</P>
<P>
 This morning on an expansive sound stage in Valencia, Waterston, Whitaker and 
Dana Delany, who plays White House Chief of Staff Betsy Corcoran, are filming a 
pivotal scene in the Oval Office in which Casey discusses with them how to stop 
the coup. (The authentic replica of the Oval Office was used in the 1993 comedy 
"Dave.") British director Jonathan Darby rehearses his cast briefly before 
shooting the scene several times. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Seven Days in May," the President (Fredric March) found himself 
increasingly unpopular with the military because he wanted to sign a peace 
treaty with the Soviet Union. The military didn't believe the Soviets were in 
earnest in their desire for peace with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the HBO version, Waterston explains during a break, it's "not specific 
about how the President got into a deep a hole (with the military), but he got 
in a very deep hole. We know that he wants to concentrate on getting rid of the 
debt and domestic issues, but to what extent he has done this -- in a wise or 
sober fashion, or that he has gone too far -- they won't say." 
</P>
<P>
 Waterston, who has played President Abraham Lincoln on TV and on Broadway, 
finds the film's premise frightening because he believes a coup could happen. 
"The thing I think is really scary is that the Army is so huge. I can't see 
quite what stops it from doing whatever it wants, except the citizenship of the 
soldiers. We never really had a big peacetime Army. I don't know if someone 
could get all the honest American citizens that are in the Army to think they 
were doing a good deed -- doing something right for the United States. I don't 
really know if that makes it impossible for this to happen. I would like some 
reassurance, wouldn't you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, "Enemy Within" was developed by executive producer Peter Douglas, 
son of Kirk Douglas, as a feature film for Columbia Pictures. That version, 
Douglas says, was closer in theme to the original. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was during the early '80s, at which time Reagan had come into office, 
damning the evil empire, the Soviet Union," Douglas says. "So, it was very much 
akin to the original movie. Then they made peace. They become friends and our 
picture died because it was so tied to the political arena." 
</P>
<P>
 When HBO became interested in the project, he says, "we began to develop it in 
a more contemporized direction." Maybe too contemporized. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas acknowledges the political climate depicted in "Enemy Within" is 
striking a tad close to home these days with the military facing budget cuts 
and the combustible situations in North Korea, the Mideast and Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our story is becoming frighteningly close not by virtue of the military 
takeover, but the parallels of what is going on in the government with the 
Congress turning on the President and the North Korea situation," Douglas says. 
"You suddenly are seeing these parallels coming up. We know it's fiction, but 
we begin to wonder if maybe we had an inside track." 
</P>
<P>
 The military, Douglas says, "views the threat (of war) today greater than it 
was during the Cold War, quite simply because you have more (enemies) and we 
don't know exactly who they are all. When you research it with people in the 
know, you find out there are significant concerns with the Iran-Iraq situation, 
despite the fact they have been warring at each other for years. You combine 
that with the issue of the (former) Soviet Union and the extreme poverty in 
that country. The hot commodity, which is readily available, is either intact 
nuclear warheads or plutonium. You suddenly have this propagation of nuclear 
threats, whereas before it was only the Soviet Union. You've got little bands 
of terrorists who could conceivably have a nuclear weapon. The military's big 
issue is that their budget has been cut." 
</P>
<P>
 Waterston finds the film's premise interesting because "you can think about it 
quite a bit and it doesn't fall apart, which makes it more scary. We could 
still blow up next week. My father (recently) turned 90, and when the Soviet 
Union came apart, I said, 'This is one of the most wonderful times I've ever 
lived through.' And he said, 'This is the scariest moment of my life.' And he'd 
been through World War I, World War II, the Korean War and Vietnam." 
</P>
<P>
 "Enemy Within" marks the feature debut of director Darby, who directed the 
1993 Oscar-nominated short film "Contact." Darby acknowledges directing a movie 
based on a classic is different from making an original. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you really only spend about five minutes thinking about that because you 
are so preoccupied with making your own story true to itself and fresh and 
strong on its own terms," he explains. "So that pretty much recedes from your 
mind quickly. This story is very different from 'Seven Days in May,' not just 
in its topical updating. It's a political as well as a military coup. It is 
less of a drama and more of a political thriller, as seen through the eyes of 
(whistle-bower) Mac Casey. It gets much closer to his character and his family. 
It's a much more personal, subjective-tense story." 
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker ("The Crying Game," "Blown Away") has yet to see the original movie 
because he didn't want to be influenced by the film. "I wanted a real close 
take on what the director was trying to do and what the script was trying to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Casey, Whitaker says, must confront himself and his relationship with his son 
as he attempts to stop the coup. "He has a really volatile situation with his 
son, who is 12," Whitaker says. "He's being rebellious and having problems in 
school. I'm trying to deal with him, but in the same manner as with the 
soldiers. It's really not working. Throughout the process of the film, I start 
to see the way I'm dealing with him and understand him better." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a tremendously complex, difficult emotional journey," Darby adds. "He 
is not a conventional, political whistle-blower, in the sense he's not a 
reporter. He's not someone who is antagonistic to the military. In many ways, 
he sympathizes with the frustration the military feels, but disagrees, of 
course, with the means they seek to erase the frustration." 
</P>
<P>
 Don't expect cameos in the film from Kirk Douglas or even director 
Frankenheimer as an homage to "Seven Days in May." 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to be compared to the original and the original is a classic," 
Peter Douglas says. "That's a tough nut to crack. I didn't think it was 
appropriate to mix the two (movies). The thing that's distinctively different 
between this and the original is we tried to integrate very real people in 
these roles. At least by my vision of the '60s, they were all big movie stars 
on the 40-foot screen. They were not accessible. The choice of Forest, who 
plays my father's role, is quite a different piece of casting. If you have ever 
been around Washington, which I have, that's the type of person you expect to 
be walking down the corridors. Not Kirk Douglas." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Enemy Within" premieres Saturday at 8 p.m. on HBO.

WHO WAS FRANKIE LA PORTE?; A NEW BIOGRAPHY CLAIMS AL CAPONE SHARED POWER WITH 
AN EVEN TOUGHER, BUT PUBLICITY-SHY, GANGSTER; CAPONE: THE MAN AND THE ERA, BY 
LAURENCE BERGREEN (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $30; 720 PP.)

<P>
 The myths about Al Capone feed off each other -- and the hunger never seems to 
be satiated. Here's another biography, "Capone: The Man and the Era." In this 
case Laurence Bergreen's fervent approach may have cut away much of the fatted 
legend. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an impressive lot of solid scholarship (i.e., reporting) in this big 
biography, with the result that Bergreen's might well be the most accurate 
Capone in all the library full of the man and that raucous era. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergreen also lays in a giant conundrum: one Frankie La Porte, whom he 
describes as "the least-known, most influential racketeer of his day." He 
quotes one old-time newspaperman relating that Capone would cower in La Porte's 
intimidating presence, as if Capone were working for him, not the other way 
around, and that La Porte shared command with Capone. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one would ever make a movie about Frankie La Porte," Bergreen writes, "for 
he avoided publicity with the zeal that Al Capone had once displayed in seeking 
it, but he remained the most powerful and capable racketeer of them all." 
</P>
<P>
 But who was La Porte? The above is just about all Bergreen gives the hapless 
reader, who is now intrigued to the teeth about this mighty mystery man. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Big Al, there's no shortage of caricatures. Take your pick: He was (a) 
an extra swell guy and a pal forever, (b) a generous, loving family man, (c) a 
wily gangster-entrepreneur in silk underwear, (d) a loudly dressed thug and 
murderous fiend in a felt fedora, (e) a poor, put-upon, misunderstood public 
benefactor who just gave people what they wanted, a few harmless vices, or (f) 
all of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 Capone is pretty well acknowledged to have been everything above, and Bergreen 
("James Agee: A Life" and "As Thousands Cheer: The Life of Irving Berlin") puts 
them all together in a sprightly mosaic. He tempers his portrait with a 
carefully built case asserting that Al's latent syphilis led to his craziest, 
most erratic behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Capone most probably contracted the disease in his very young years from a 
neighborhood prostitute, and then the symptoms seemed to go away. It's 
recognized that syphilis led to his Alzheimer's-like dementia in later years 
and his eventual death in 1947 at age 48. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bergreen's claim is that Capone's megalomania, occasional hallucinations 
and penchant for brutality were the result of tertiary syphilis, and that, 
without the disease, there never would have been a larger-than-life Al Capone. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergreen also boldly builds a case that Capone ingested cocaine on a regular 
basis and this, too, augmented his often bizarre behavior. Some authorities 
would assert that the Chicago mob was notoriously opposed to drug use, but then 
others counter-assert that cocaine wasn't considered dangerous in those days. 
</P>
<P>
 The author fleshes out his characterizations with zealous pursuit of anybody 
still around who knew anything -- old caddies, for example. Funny testimony 
comes from Timothy Sullivan, who was 12 in 1925 when he was a caddy at Burnham 
Wood for a motley foursome of "Scarface Al," mob bookkeeper Jake "Greasy Thumb" 
Guzik, Jack "Machine Gun" McGurn and Fred "Killer" Burke. (The latter two 
assuredly were shooters at the later St. Valentine's Day Massacre.) 
</P>
<P>
 They all may have had impressive nicknames, but their drunken performances on 
the links were less than impressive. Capone seemed gentle and patient to young 
Tim but his golf, well, "I don't think he broke 60 for the nine holes," 
Sullivan relates. "He could drive the ball half a mile but he always hooked it 
and he couldn't putt for beans." 
</P>
<P>
 Sullivan computed that at $500 per hole (big money these days, much bigger 
those days), the gangsters exchanged about $10,000 that game. Being gangsters, 
of course, they cheated each other, and the boy carried extra balls in his 
pocket, dropping them as needed for better lies and nice tips from Al. 
</P>
<P>
 Capone naturally had a .45 revolver hidden in his golf bag and, just as 
naturally, one day the gun went off and the bullet hit him in the groin. His 
golf partner, Mayor Johnny Patton, ran him to St. Margaret's Hospital in 
Hammond. Sullivan relates that thereafter "the boys" always checked their 
safety catches as they set out on the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the Frankie La Porta mystery, Bergreen delivers some intriguing 
elements, including the generally unreported job that Capone held between his 
Brooklyn and Chicago underworld careers. It seemed all too legitimate for the 
young tough. He had taken his young wife and new baby to Baltimore where he 
worked, in daily suit and tie, as a bookkeeper for a construction company. 
</P>
<P>
 But following the death of his father Gabriele in 1920, young Al assumed the 
patriarchal role for his mom and siblings and finally moved to Chicago and a 
job offer from his early mentor, Johnny Torrio. 
</P>
<P>
 The author chronicles the persistent irritations of J. Edgar Hoover as 
recorded in his various notes. He didn't want his FBI involved in any Capone 
and bootlegging investigations because he wasn't sure he could win the day -- 
and yet he didn't like to see anybody else get any credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergreen also rips away -- as many historians have -- at the pristine image of 
Eliot Ness, who has enjoyed one of the greatest publicity coups of the century. 
Readers may recall that it was young sportswriter Oscar Fraley who, two years 
after Ness' death, tookNess' flat, unpublished autobiography (several original 
passages are published here), pumped it full of hot air and released it as "The 
Untouchables." 
</P>
<P>
 Bergreen tries, not entirely with success, to interweave all these characters 
and events. He presents a lot of sourcing for his assertions, although his 
logic often hippity-hops around. He's longer and wordier than he needs to be, 
primarily because he tends to adore some of his research and can't let it go 
unwritten, even when it's not to the point. And, whereas he avoids the 
temptation to use the bloody jargon of 1920s Chicago, he sometimes drifts into 
a scholarly mood. 
</P>
<P>
 But for those readers looking for some action, this isn't to say that it's 
short on blood. Bergreen recounts some of explosive moments in this volatile 
life: how Capone won his scars, the infamous baseball-bat murders, the 
Valentine's massacre, assorted assassinations and other atrocities. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere in there is the essence of Al Capone and despite his ruthlessness, 
somehow we begin to understand him here (or think we do) and somehow feel his 
degradation in Alcatraz and his fading seasons. Maybe we like to see our mighty 
fall, but we don't like to see them degraded.

 Your July 10 Style layout, "Grandes Dames," had the most beautiful photographs 
that I have ever seen in a newspaper. I found it hard to believe that these 
were photographs and not actual paintings. The impact of these re-creations of 
the great paintings was so electric that, in my opinion, they constitute great 
works of art themselves.

PROTECTING THE FREE THINKERS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for Sharon Whitley's piece on BLAM! ("Courting Justice," Palm 
Latitudes, July 10). It was clearly written and accurate and immensely welcome 
to those of us who respect and revere the Constitution of the United Satates, 
and who are doing everything we can to preserve the personal freedoms it 
guarantees. 
</P>
<P>
 My childhood and early adulthood were spent as an American living abroad in 
Singapore and Kingston, Jamaica. While I was living in Jamaica, martial law was 
declared and all guns and ammunition were confiscated by the government. A 
concentration camp was erected in Kingston, complete with barbed wire and armed 
guards. Anyone caught with even a single bullet was immediately incarcerated, 
with no trial, for an indeterminate amount of time. Thus I learned very early 
that a written Constitution is the only defense against the government's 
seizing power overnight.

COULD IT REALLY HAPPEN? ASK THE CONSULTANT 
</P>

<P>
By SUSAN KING

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, Charles J. Dunlap thought about what could lead to a military 
coup in the United States in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 His paper on the subject, "The Origins of the American Military Coup of 2012," 
was co-winner of the Chairman, Joint Chiefs of Staff, Strategy Essay Contest. 
It also won the attention of Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, a U.S. Air Force officer serving in the grade of colonel, is now 
technical adviser on "The Enemy Within." 
</P>
<P>
 Working with the filmmakers in an off-duty capacity, Dunlap stresses that his 
opinions are his alone and do not reflect those of the Department of Defense or 
any of its components. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what the concern is, is that we have been downsizing the military," 
Dunlap says. "At the same time, there are a lot of threats out there. In 
addition to the threats, the regular orthodox military threats, a lot of people 
want to use the military for all kinds of other things. I think that a lot of 
people in the military are concerned that we are spreading ourselves too thin 
at the very time there's less to spread." 
</P>
<P>
 The military, Dunlap believes, is much more political today than it has 
historically been. "I think the one thing in government that has worked fairly 
well has been the military," he says. "When you look at a political problem 
like Haiti or Somalia, people look to the military, maybe not as an armed 
force, but as a way of solving the problem. Domestically, there are constant 
calls to use the military in the cities. When you apply the dwindling resources 
against these growing missions, there is a lot of concern that the military 
won't be able to fight an authentic military opponent if it comes up." 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap says he doesn't want to mislead anyone. "There are no conspirators that 
I know of in the military." But, he adds, "Plato says that only the dead have 
seen the end of war. I think, unfortunately, the human condition is such that 
there will continue to be conflict. I hope people don't interpret this movie as 
a question for a bigger military budget because it really isn't that. But what 
I think it is really (about) is that people have to think real hard about what 
they want the military to do and the kind of stresses it can put on the 
military when they ask them to do too many things." SUSAN KING

 Love conquers all? Imagine living in a post-strife-torn city where those who 
marry across barriers of class, color and religion are discreetly tolerated in 
sophisticated settings but constantly denigrated in the streets. Imagine 
yourself -- if you dare -- in my skin, unable to go anywhere without 
anticipating trouble: 
</P>
<P>
 * We duck into a mid-Wilshire hang for appetizers, find the music enticing and 
ditch the buffet for a few rhythmic twirls. We're unaware that we've become an 
issue until we sense the laserlike stare of a young black man. I'm the object 
of his vibes. In the darkness, he doesn't notice I'm at least 12 years his 
senior and sport a wedding ring. He's blinded by the sight of a mixed couple 
and huffs around us in a hostile orbit. We shine him on. Not to be ignored, he 
tries to cut in, rudely thumping my man's shoulder. Huz grimaces and shakes his 
head. Youngblood stomps off to a dark corner, an altercation brewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Our fun spoiled, we make for the exit. 
</P>
<P>
 * While my husband nurses his frozen yogurt at a Glendale mall rest stop, I 
step into a luggage boutique. I answer the ugly glare of the Semitic owner with 
an awkward nod, then examine the stock. I decide on a slender, wine-colored 
tote. At the register, I present my check and requisite IDs. "Credit card or 
cash," he admonishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thrown, I leave, angrily swallowing epithets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you find anything?" Huz asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, but my check was refused. I'm too black for 'em." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ridiculous. Come on, I'll get it for you." He marches me back into the shop. 
"My wife was in here to buy a briefcase. Where is it?" Flustered, the owner 
reaches under the counter. "Sweetheart, is that the one?" I nod. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll take it!" Authoritatively, Huz plucks a check from his wallet. Without 
a word, the owner bags the case. "I told you they'd take a check," Huz says 
when we get outside. "Yeah," I smirk, "from you. " 
</P>
<P>
 * We bogart through heavy traffic to the nearest pump at the Melrose 
self-serve station, unintentionally cutting off another car. My man jumps out, 
tugs the recalcitrant nozzle to the rear. There's a screech of rubber and 
scream of brakes. The incensed driver roars up on our bumper, threatening my 
beloved with below-the-knee amputations. Unintimidated, Huz shouts: "You dirty 
mutha -- !" 
</P>
<P>
 The driver, an American of African descent, inches taller and outweighing my 
man by 30 pounds, mushrooms out onto the blacktop. Succumbing to heat and 
gridlock-inspired tensions, Huz continues the tongue-lashing. The driver, 
insulted by being badmouthed in front of his family, silently goes into his 
trunk for a tire iron. 
</P>
<P>
 I scramble out of our car and buffalo up behind my man. The driver is 
surprised. That I'm black matters and uncomfortably complicates his rage. A 
grudging truce ensues. The driver lowers the tire iron, and we finish getting 
our gas. But there are no apologies. 
</P>
<P>
 * I'm satisfied with my cafe latte to go, but Huz wants a real breakfast 
elsewhere. At his favorite Los Feliz cafe, there are no more spaces in the lot. 
We contemplate street parking as a white coupe pulls up behind us. I don't 
think my brimming latte will survive the gyrations, so I climb out, aware that 
the white male driver is watching. I catch his eyes, don't recognize him and 
turn away. 
</P>
<P>
 While Huz parks, I wait at a nearby lamppost. The white coupe swerves curbside 
in front of me, the electronic window lowered. The driver's fly is unzipped. 
He's flapping his circumcision at me. I break into unrestrained laughter. He 
speeds off. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's so funny?" Huz asks. I tell him. He wants to kill the guy. "It was an 
absurdly pathetic act," I say. He is amazed that I'm so philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 * Our favorite Thai eatery is packed, so we take a number, then briefly stroll 
the grungy Vermont Avenue business strip. We're in an exceptionally romantic 
mood, holding hands, sneaking a kiss. Suddenly, we're being stared down by a 
group of Latino men. As they pass, one turns and shouts at my back. " Puta !" 
</P>
<P>
 * At a Pacoima gathering, an old acquaintance greets me with a warm hello, 
then: "Are you still with that Jewish fellow?" I look at her thoughtfully, then 
smile -- "Yesssss."

PALM LATITUDES: BEING THERE; BIKE BUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By R. Daniel Foster 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm trailing LAPD officer Rudy Lopez when he spots three suspected drug 
dealers. He darts across 7th Street, hurls his bike against the curb and orders 
the men to put their hands against the wall. His partner, Stacey Age, and I 
follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the officers can search them, I hear gagging -- the sound of a drug 
dealer swallowing his cache of heroine or cocaine. With the evidence gone, the 
police are forced to let the men walk away. We cycle on in search of more 
criminals among the canyons of Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez and Age are two of the Central Division's 12 officers who patrol 
Downtown on bikes. There are at least a dozen police divisions with bike 
patrols in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, Age and I cycle past a clutch of prostitutes on Main Street, then head 
toward the Garment District. Along the way, they hand out zoning violation 
tickets to three sidewalk fruit vendors, chase off two window washers pestering 
motorists, rouse a sleeping man from the sidewalk, give out a jaywalking ticket 
and chat with merchants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are you the real police?" asks an elderly woman. Many people mistake the 
patrol for a security detail, a misconception that works in the officers' 
favor: Few people see them coming. 
</P>
<P>
 While the officers are more approachable on bikes, Age says they also are 
easier targets: "I've had water thrown at me, combs, fingernail polish -- you 
name it. When I wrote out a ticket for a fruit vendor two weeks ago, a mob 
surrounded me, shouting, 'Let her go! Let her go!' " 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end we've cycled 10 miles, the last several near 5th and Crocker, a 
district notorious for drug dealing. As we barrel through the intersection, 
Lopez once again tosses his bike against the curb. Within seconds, another 
three men are against a wall. Motioning me over, Lopez pulls out a fistful of 
crack cocaine from one man's pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, while cycling home through the area, a transient throws a beer can at 
me, yelling, "Hey! Don't feel so safe anymore without your friends, huh?" I 
shift gears and navigate a patch of broken glass, praying that my bike's thin 
racing tires will survive the trip home. R. Daniel Foster

PALM LATITUDES: CLOSE-UP; INDIGENOUS ROCK

<TEXT>

 Robby Romero learned the hard way that the adage, "write what you know," 
applies to musicians, too. Romero was 14 when he met Dennis Hopper in Taos. The 
fledgling musician took Hopper's advice to try his luck in Los Angeles and was 
soon opening for Paul Butterfield and hanging around with the likes of Bob 
Dylan, Gene Clark of the Byrds, Rick Danko of The Band amd Leonard Cohen. He 
also sank into drugs and drink and, very ill, went home in the early 1980s to 
Indian Country to clean himself out. There, he hooked up with mentor and 
activist Dennis Banks, founder of the American Indian Movement, and began life 
on "The Red Road, the Indian Road, the good road." 
</P>
<P>
 Now he and his band are trying to change the world through music -- and the 
world of music; America's social confusion is, after all, nowhere more evident 
than in the themes of rap and grunge. "It's anti-everything, anti-life," he 
says. "We're talking about 'I don't care about my life, I don't care about your 
life.' I'm not saying its all like that, or that it's right or wrong, I'm just 
saying people should pay a little more attention to it. 
</P>
<P>
 The 4-year-old band has performed its socially concious music with 10,000 
Maniacs, Bruce Hornsby, Carlos Santana, Bonnie Raitt and Jackson Browne, and 
its five-song album, "Red Thunder," is distributed by Canyon Records and Indian 
Arts in Phoenix. Romero and drummer Benito Concha appeared in a several MTV 
"Free Your Mind" public service announcements, and Romero directed a VH-1 
special, "Makoce Wakan: Sacred Earth" on the spiritual sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Romero, who is of Apache descent, believes that indigenous wisdom will "usher 
us into a time of healing. It's in the native prophecies," he says, "that the 
children of America will come to the doorstep of indigenous people. And if 
people don't change the way they're thinking about the Earth, our Mother, about 
themselves, about their part on the Sacred Circle of Life, then we'll enter -- 
if we haven't already -- the point of no return and the Earth will begin to 
cleanse herself. And when this cleansing process takes place there'll be no 
discrimination. And those who understand the natural laws of life will have an 
easier time." Janet Kinosian

 A STRANGER IN THIS WORLD Stories by Kevin Canty (Doubleday: $20; 180 pp.) 
These are lean, bleak, powerful stories, which is not to say that they are 
lacking in tenderness.It just means that the characters who possess the least 
hint of vulnerability; genetic, financial, romantic, usually get squashed, like 
Judy in "Pretty Judy," a somehow disabled, sweet-dispositioned, very large 
young girl who is drawn into a sexual relationship with the boy next door. As 
in so many of these stories, however, the victim and the perpetrator both get 
hit by the shrapnel of some social or psychic explosion, some common 20th 
century malady like loneliness. In "The Victim," Tina, who suffers from a 
work-related repetitive motion disorder, just wants a normal life. Caught in a 
bad situation, every instinct she has left tells her not to take the next step. 
Canty, who lives in Montana and has had stories published in Esquire and Story, 
knows how to hurt us the way Flannery O'Connor did, and to scare us the way 
Dennis Johnson can.

 The 1992 TV movie The Secret (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) stars Kirk Douglas as the 
proprietor of a Cape Cod general store coping with the self-imposed stigma of 
dyslexia. It's a film marked by multilayered family relationships, a vivid 
sense of place and a vulnerable performance by Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans of the 1984 mega-hit comedy "Ghostbusters" were able to breathe a little 
easier when the spiffy sequel Ghostbusters II (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.) came out 
in the summer of 1989. The filmmakers lost none of the edge and were able to 
bring back all of the original stars -- Sigourney Weaver, Bill Murray, Harold 
Ramis, Dan Aykroyd and Ernie Hudson, who this time combat a massive attack of 
slime caused by all the negative energy in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 1989 Licence to Kill (KTTV Monday at 7:30 p.m.) milks the usual 
James Bond formula of sex, violence and exotic locales, the film's overall tone 
is more burnished and somber as it sends the then-new OO7, Timothy Dalton, on a 
desperate one-man vendetta against a South American cocaine czar (Robert Davi). 
</P>
<P>
 The 1989 TV movie of Agatha Christie's early The Man in the Brown Suit (KCOP 
Thursday at 8 p.m.) has been Americanized and updated to the present, yet the 
adaptation leaves Christie's twists and turns fairly intact and makes for 
pleasant viewing. Escapist fare with an international touch, it has an 
enjoyable cast that makes it worthwhile, especially Stefanie Zimbalist as the 
adventure-hungry heroine who witnesses a death while touring Egypt.

 In The Final Countdown (KTTV Saturday at 6 p.m.), the aircraft carrier Nimitz, 
skippered by Kirk Douglas, zips 40 years across time to intercept the Japanese 
war fleet en route to Pearl Harbor. Curiously, the special effects are the 
weakest aspect of this 1980 release, but it gets by on the cleverness of its 
story, directed in straightforward fashion by Don Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Schrader's underrated 1980 American Gigolo (KCOP Saturday at 6 p.m.) is a 
stunning, high-style study of a handsome young man (Richard Gere) who lives off 
women. Schrader resolves the film's thriller plot with a daring, unexpected act 
of spiritual redemption in homage to one of his heroes, austere French director 
Robert Bresson. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1975 Night Moves (KCOP Saturda at 8 p.m.), also underrated, is a stylish 
Chandleresque detective mystery. The investigation of a murder by a tough yet 
vulnerable private eye (Gene Hackman) becomes a quest for his own identity and 
a pursuit of truth that cuts through many layers of Southern California social 
strata and ends with a wry sense of irony.

 Thank you for Susan King's lovely retrospective of the stars from the recent 
past (TV Times, July 31). 
</P>
<P>
 I'm 74 and these people were so much a part of my growing up -- that is why I 
really appreciated the thoughtfulness of you remembering them. Especially Dana 
Andrews. While volunteering at the Democratic headquarters in the San Fernando 
Valley, I remember one afternoon answering phones. He called in for some 
information and we had a lovely conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you again for giving recognition to a group of people sometimes 
underrated and forgotten.

 THE DADA ALMANAC edited by Richard Huelsenbeck. (Serpent's Tail: $19.99; 175 
pp.) Born from the cultural despair of rootless artists and intellectuals in 
Europe after the traumatic onset of World War I, about all that can be said 
unequivocally about Dadaism is that for its brief life its adherents and 
promoters reveled in apotropaic primitivism, an anti-political internationalism 
and a fervent devotion to artistic boundary crossing.It's perhaps the first 
intellectual movement whose desperation is such that its humor and its 
seriousness cannot be easily distinguished. Poet and performer Richard 
Huelsenbeck was the original editor of the "Dada Almanac," issued in Berlin in 
1920, it was the movement's largest and one of its last collaborative 
publications. As he states in his introduction, "One cannot understand Dada; 
one must experience it." Though the Dadaists refused to have their movement 
defined, they themselves played perpetually with mock definitions, and the 
"Almanac" is full of them: "The Dadaist is equally an artist and an 
eel-worshipper"; "DADA -- this is a word that throws up ideas so that they can 
be shot down"; Dada "has war and peace under its toga, but decides in favor of 
the cherry brandy flip." Along with Hans Richter's classic firsthand account, 
"Dada: Art and Anti-Art," "The Dada Almanac" is an excellent place to 
"experience" Dadaism in its on terms and in all its contradictions. This new 
edition reproduces the original's illustrations and eccentric typography and 
adds a densely historical preface, additional documentary photographs and, most 
helpfully, extensive marginal glosses. It also makes available significant 
texts by lesser-known figures such as Walter Mehring, Georges 
Ribemont-Dessaignes and Raoul Hausmann. If there's a reason that the Dadaists 
appeal to our own cultural confusions, it can undoubtedly be discovered here.

THE PLEASURES OF READING, BY CHARLES SIMIC

<TEXT>
<P>
 On his deathbed my father is reading 
</P>
<P>
 The memoirs of Casanova. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm watching the night fall, 
</P>
<P>
 A few windows being lit across the street. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of them a young woman is reading 
</P>
<P>
 Close to the glass. 
</P>
<P>
 She hasn't looked up in a long while,

 Even with the darkness coming. 
</P>
<P>
 While there's still a bit of light, 
</P>
<P>
 I want her to lift her head,

<P>
 So I can see her face 
</P>
<P>
 Which I have already imagined, 
</P>
<P>
 But her book must be full of suspense.

<P>
 And besides, it's so quiet,

 Every time she turns a page,

 I can hear my father turn one too,

 As if they are reading the same book.

 DAISY BATES IN THE DESERT: A Woman's Life Among the Aborgines by Julia 
Blackburn. (Pantheon: $22; 231 pp.) "Daisy Bates was a liar," writes Julia 
Blackburn. "Of that I am sure." It's good of her to tell us up front this way, 
and really, it hardly matters, except that the rare facts of Daisy's life serve 
a prismatic, refractory function that yields the most gorgeous patterns of 
light and shadow. She was born in 1863 ("or 1861") in Ireland. Both parents 
died shortly after she was born. After this her childhood is completely 
self-invented to include Queen Victoria and much scandal and elegance, all of 
which became the woman (only five foot two but everyone remembers her much 
taller) who went to the desert in Australia to live with the cannibals and 
become Kabbarli, "the white-skinned grandmother." Her first year there she 
married Breaker Morant, who was imprisoned a month after the wedding for 
stealing. She then married Jack Bates, who was accused of murder in the Boer 
War and shot in front of a firing squad. With Jack Bates she had a son, Arnold, 
who she left at the age of 8 for five years in a boarding school while she 
traveled back to England. She never returned to motherhood per se, but she 
faced her guilt and sporadic longing for her son head on, standing firm by her 
decision to abandon him, even when, as an adult, he came to visit her camp and 
she would not let him enter her tent because he was a man.Blackburn's writing 
is pure and lovely, and the way she melts into Daisy Bates reminds me of an 
exhibit in the Exploratorium, a science museum in San Francisco in which two 
people sit on either side of a screen and are able, with various knobs and 
buttons, to merge their two faces. "I have never much tried to tell people 
about my thoughts," she writes, "it's quieter if I simply join them in theirs." 
At one point, Daisy tells the story of an aborigine who lovingly pieces 
together the sun-dried skeleton of her dead child. What Blackburn does for 
Daisy Bates is a little bit like that.

 I would rather see a rerun of "The John Larroquette Show" than a premiere of a

which I can't understand.

 The writing, directing and supporting cast are excellent. The show is so real. 
I have had real "out loud" laughs while watching this show and, in the same 
half hour, tears. Please keep the show on, NBC. John Larroquette is superb.

 THE MYTHS OF MOTHERHOOD by Shari L. Thurer. (Houghton Mifflin: $22.95; 381 
pp.) "Good mothering is a cultural invention," writes Shari Thurer, 
psychologist and mother.And guess who has traditionally invented it? "My aim in 
writing this book is to make mothers' internal lives acceptable to them, to 
undo some of the angst among mothers. . . ." Indeed, once we have somersaulted 
through the misogyny and infanticide of the ancient Greeks, Romans and 
Phoenicians; the Madonna worship of the Middle Ages; the Holy Mother/impure 
prostitute duality of Christianity; the beatific Renaissance; the good peasant 
mother of the Reformation; the Puritan's witches; the 19-Century pedestal for 
the moral mother; Dickensian sacrifice at the altar of domestic happiness in 
the Victorian era; and the social and biological revolution (Oh, I'm sorry, did 
you miss it?) of the 20th Century, the reader feels, well, tired. Very, very 
tired. The conclusion? The ideology of motherhood is fickle. Don't let cultural 
imperatives get you down.

 THE BURDENS OF SISTER MARGARET by Craig Harline. (Doubleday: $24; 359 pp.) God 
is just an extra in this running gossip column on life in a 17th-Century 
convent of third-order Franciscans in Leuven in the Netherlands.(Now I know 
what they mean by petty burgher.) Sister Margaret Smulders entered the convent 
of Bethlehem in 1606 at age 21. Almost immediately, the new postulant began to 
record the transgressions, slights and sins of the other sisters, often in 
preparation for a "visitation" from a bishop, archbishop or dean. Not 
surprisingly, this did not endear her to the other veiled sisters, and she was 
expelled from the community twice, from 1616 to 1618 and from 1624 to 1635. 
Various signs, including a dog with its head in the ground, apparitions and 
"shining rays of the moon" exposed the only possible explanation for Margaret's 
agitating, rabble-rousing behavior: Margaret was a witch. Either that or she 
was possessed. Politely, and against almost everyone's wishes, she was given a 
guest room, from which, until her death in 1648, she wrote her revenge. As it 
turns out, Margaret was also pretty, and one of the demons possessing her took 
the form of the house confessor Henri Joos, whose routine sexual advances were 
not confined to Sister Margaret. Being "importuned by carnal affections" made 
Margaret melancholy and suicidal. Melancholy, in the physic of the day, lead to 
possession. Not at all surprisingly, victims were often young women. Many of 
Margaret's complaints involve the Mater, Anna Vignarola (later Adriana Truis), 
her favoritism, her unseemly generosity, her love of holidays. Like all 
pettiness, Margaret's backfires, and the Mater comes out looking like a pretty 
nice nun. Margaret dies "with optimum disposition of spirit," within the "bosom 
of the church" to the strains of the Pater Noster.

CRIMINAL PURSUITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES CHAMPLIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Lee Burke is one of the half-dozen best writers of crime fiction in 
America. His prose is an uncommon mixture of taut realism and poetic eloquence. 
Yet the hallmark of his Dave Robicheaux series is a sense of the author's 
compassionate humanity: his portrayal of good people wanting only to be left 
alone in their loving family relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 They aren't left alone, of course. Burke creates villains and villainies of 
high persuasiveness, brutal confrontations, the deaths of innocents and the 
meting out of grisly paybacks, seldom more spectacularly than in DIXIE CITY JAM 
(Hyperion, 367 pp., $22.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Are there one or more German submarines in watery graves off the Louisiana 
coast, sunk as they preyed on oil tankers in the Gulf during World War II? 
Robicheaux, the New Orleans detective and reformed drunk who also runs a bait 
shop in the bayous and does some deep-sea diving, remembers the U-boat stories 
from childhood. He is hired to spot and salvage one of the wrecks and thereby 
sets off a sequence of events suspenseful, violent and, even by Burke's own 
high standards, intricately plotted and compelling. 
</P>
<P>
 The sub is a prize for neo-Nazis, one shadowy, malevolent and sadistic creep 
in particular. Robicheaux's wife and the daughter he rescued and adopted in an 
earlier book ("Heaven's Prisoners") are imperiled. An accomplice posing as a 
nun is a classic villainess. The climax aboard ship in the Gulf at night is a 
thrilling set-piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke creates a large cast of characters, sharply drawn, colorful and, more 
often than not, likable. The affectionate accuracy with which Burke evokes the 
bayou country, life in the parishes as well as in New Orleans, infuses the 
imagined events (hovering close to the preposterous) with a kind of it-must- 
be-so veracity. 
</P>
<P>
 He is very good and, after a long climb that began in literary journals, Burke 
has broken onto the best-seller lists, enjoying large promotional budgets and 
now a film, with Alex Baldwin as Robicheaux in "Heaven's Prisoners," due 
shortly. The new book is Burke as his best. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other writers of crime fiction, Nancy Pickard pushes at the presumed 
limits of the genre. Her "I.O.U." looked hard at a mother-daughter relationship 
from the viewpoint of a daughter's guilt. In CONFESSION (Pocket Books, 307 pp., 
$20) Pickard's Jenny Cain confronts another in-family crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 A young man appears at the door, announcing that he is her policeman husband 
Geof's son from a long-ago liaison. The son's mother and adoptive father are 
lately dead in what the police concluded was a murder-suicide pact. The son 
disagrees, and demands that Geof investigate. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's Jenny, coping with anger, retroactive jealousy and confusion over 
what seems her husband's betrayal, who ends up doing most of the investigating. 
(By profession, she runs small-city charitable foundations, but crime-solving 
has become part of the job.) The truth is sad, complicated and surprising, and 
Pickard offers fine insight to character and relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Solomita started writing in off-hours during his 12 years as a New 
York cabdriver. He has since parked the taxi for good. LAST TIME FOR GLORY 
(Otto Penzler Books, 310 pp., $21) is his seventh novel and a good and notably 
readable job it is. 
</P>
<P>
 A young private eye, a vodka-soaked old cop and a flamboyant criminal lawyer 
who has done more than his share to see justice undone combine to try to free a 
retarded man convicted of a murder he confessed to but didn't commit. 
</P>
<P>
 The triptych of portraits, especially of the cop, Bela Kosinski, is the 
engrossing heart of the book, although Solomita's demonstration of the justice 
system's lust for a convictable culprit at any cost, is also engrossing in its 
heart-chilling way. 
</P>
<P>
 Solomita tells a lively story, copiously flavored with irony and with a strong 
sense of underlying values in place. What's right and what isn't is never in 
doubt. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Scream (Doubleday, 324 pp., $19.95) is the second thriller by Texas 
writer Mary Willis Walker. Her first, "Zero to the Bone," won one major prize 
and was nominated for another as best debut novel. The new book is an assured 
trip through that upper reach of Texas society where money mostly buys trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Molly Cates is a newspaper reporter who has published a true crime book about 
the killing of an heiress by a murderous drifter named Louis Bronk, now on 
Death Row with his execution imminent. The chapter headings are his doggerel 
verses. Molly will witness the execution and so, by Bronk's invitation, will 
the victim's children. 
</P>
<P>
 But the victim's father makes a crude attempt to bribe Molly off reviving the 
murder story before the execution, and new doggerel, mimicking Bronk mimicking 
Bronk but with veiled threats on her life, show up in her mailbox. What keener 
ways to motivate an aggressive reporter to start digging again? The murders are 
not over yet, either. 
</P>
<P>
 The inflammatory title is the reporter's outrage at injustice, but irony is 
the flavor of the month, to be tasted again in Walker's clever and readable 
story. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacramento's Steve Martini is another of the lawyers, or former lawyers, 
writing superior thrillers about the law. "Prime Witness" was prime and his 
latest, Undue Influence (Putnam, 462 pp., $22.95) is up to standard, which is 
to say first-rate. 
</P>
<P>
 His continuing protagonist, Paul Mariani, is now a widower, his wife's dying 
request having been that he look after her kid sister. No small request; the 
sister is in a bitter custody fight with her ex, a potent state legislator with 
judicial ambitions. When his new wife is murdered, Mariani's protectee is 
charged with her murder. 
</P>
<P>
 The courtroom stuff is excitingly theatrical as always, but Martini is not 
stuck indoors. There is a dangerous detour to Hawaii in quest of a mysterious 
pair of government-protected witnesses. Later, a prowling pursuit through a 
darkened locomotive museum provides shivers that Hitchcock would have loved. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Taylor Rosenberg, drawing as before on her work as a police office and 
probation worker, explores the justice system again in First Offense (Dutton, 
$22.95, 338 pp.). Ann Carlisle, a young probation officer, is assigned a young 
first-time drug offender who's been given probation in lieu of jail time. 
</P>
<P>
 Bafflingly, she is shot and seriously wounded even as she leaves the 
courthouse. It is the onset of bafflements, not the least of which is a jar of 
severed fingers found in a refrigerator. Someone quite demented is stalking 
Carlisle, and it may well be someone who doesn't SEEM demented. The reader may 
be baffled less long than Carlisle, but the ultimate stalk is splendidly 
suspenseful all the same. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angel Gang (St. Martin's, $20.95, 262 pp.) concludes Ken Kuhlken's trilogy 
set in and about San Diego in the years just before, during and just after 
World War II. Now 44 and bald, Tom Hickey, sometime cop, MP and private eye, is 
playing sax for a living up in Tahoe, with his wife Wendy, whom he had rescued 
in an earlier caper, expecting a baby. 
</P>
<P>
 The past beckons: a call from a singer he had also helped in an earlier caper, 
now under arrest for murder and demanding his help. Subtlety is not Hickey's 
MO, and he pokes enough ant hills back in San Diego to endanger himself and his 
wife, who is kidnaped in Tahoe to make Hickey back off. 
</P>
<P>
 The new book is swift and active, but the first of the trilogy, "The Loud 
Adios," remains the best of the three in its recapturing of the period and its 
portrait of the younger, even wilder Hickey. 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie Wilson Wesley, executive editor of Essence magazine, makes her debut 
as a crime novelist with When Death Comes Stealing (Putnam, $19.95, 219 pp.). 
Tamara Hayle is a black ex-cop and single mother, now trying to make it as a 
private eye in Newark. Her ex-husband, who has a son by each of four wives, 
including Hayle, needs help. Two of his sons are dead, a year apart to the day. 
It's more than coincidence. A third dies, putting Hayle's own son at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Revenge is the only likely explanation, and so it is, explained by a tragic 
history. But good as the construction of the story is, what may well linger 
with the reader is the incidental music -- the tang of the speech, the sense of 
life observed or imagined as it is lived on the hard lower edge of a hard city. 
Wesley's book is a valuable debut.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; 'ANIMANIACS' GET ON THE PEACE 
TRAIN; DISNEY'S 'RED' GETS A COURT TRIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In celebration of the 25th anniversary of Woodstock, Steven Spielberg's 
Animaniacs offer their own historical take on the musical love fest. 
</P>
<P>
 A toon "newsreel" introduces the tumultuous time by showing soldiers marching 
to war and activists in the peace movement; Skippy is an eager participant in 
the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to get away from New York, the hippies and their relentless anti-war 
sentiments, that crabby squirrel, Slappy, takes nephew Skippy for a little R&R 
in the country. Unfortunately, his little treehouse just happens to reside 
smack in the middle of Max Yasgur's farm. 
</P>
<P>
 When the strains of Janis Joplin singing wake her up, Slappy finds her 
treehouse surrounded by flower children and asks Skippy what's happening. In 
the first of many parodies of Woodstock, Skippy replies: "There's something 
happening here/ what it is ain't exactly clear," a lyric from Buffalo 
Springfield's famous song "For What It's Worth." 
</P>
<P>
 Other irreverent bits include one on Jimi Hendrix and a takeoff of Abbott and 
Costello's "Who's on First" routine -- when The Who takes stage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Animaniacs are often visiting historical moments and this episode is 
basically a generation-gap comedy, with Slappy representing the old and Skippy 
the new," says Tom Ruegger, senior producer. "That's what a lot of Woodstock 
represented to a lot of people. No other event probably capsulized the 
generation gap like Woodstock did. We also saw the opportunity to parody bands 
and songs." 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the spirit, Slappy gets a little dose of the left wing, and Skippy 
is in squirrel heaven. "It's nice to have some vents in our show that say 
something to the parents in our audience," Ruegger says. "Even if they can't 
relate directly to Woodstock, they can recognize the 'Who's On First?' parody." 
But if there is a message, he says, "It's about tolerance. Tolerance for the 
needs and wishes of each generation." 
</P>
<P>
 A black-and-white cartoon short, reminiscent of a toon from 1929, featuring 
the Warners -- Yakko, Wakko and Dot -- in a bakery, precedes the Woodstock 
episode. 
</P>
<P>
 The Woodstock episode of "Steven Spielberg Presents Animaniacs" airs Monday at 
4 p.m. on Fox. For ages 2 to 8. Another Family Show 
</P>
<P>
 The Disney Channel combines the classic tale of Little Red Riding Hood with 
ice skating to present The Trial of Red Riding Hood. 
</P>
<P>
 This version is updated with an Olympic silver medalist, Elizabeth Manley, 
playing a not-quite-so-little Red. Set in a Yukon town in 1900, Red is on trial 
for the crime of wolfslaughter. Her story is told through witness reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Off to visit her grandmother (Andrea Martin), she runs into The Boy Who Cried 
Wolf, Three Rappin' Little Pigs, con artist Phineas T. Wolf (Alan Thicke), 
Wolf's son (Domenic Zambronga), and a handsome woodsman (Paul Martini). The 
appearance of a surprise witness throws the verdict out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Trial of Red Riding Hood" premieres Wednesday at 7 p.m. on the Disney 
Channel. For ages 4 and up .

COMMENTARY; COME RAIN OR SHINE, THE WEATHER CHANNEL CONNECTS US ALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRAZIER MOORE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes "Ya think it's gonna rain?" becomes a life-or-death question. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Southeastern part of the country," the Weather Channel's Declan Cannon 
was saying not that long ago, "you can see scattered thunderstorms on the map, 
and that's certainly a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 You could and it was, and flooding continued. 
</P>
<P>
 But a weathercast does more than frame calamity. It's a way to make sense of a 
world that makes little sense once you factor in people -- and a way for you to 
feel connected to those people, every one of whom, like you, happens to be 
subject to the weather's whims. 
</P>
<P>
 A weathercast helps you put away the past, focus on the present, and prepare 
for -- sometimes yield to -- an ever-uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 And since weather just goes on and on, when the weathercast does too, you've 
got nothing less than a play-by-play account of the game of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Good evening, America! A nonstop weather telethon has begun," meteorologist 
Bruce Edwards greeted a small and probably skeptical audience when the Weather 
Channel signed on May 2, 1982. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't stopped since," says Edwards, who with some 65 fellow 
meteorologists reaches 55.6 million households across the United States today. 
An average 185,000 homes are tuned in at any given moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Headquartered in an office park in northwest Atlanta, the Weather Channel is a 
ceaseless procession of oracles and isobars, delivered in fast-moving but 
easygoing fashion. "Weather you can always turn to," you are reminded 
incessantly. "Accurate and dependable." 
</P>
<P>
 In most respects, it doesn't vary much from the weather segment on your local 
news. But there's one big difference: Weather Channel weathercasters are spared 
the burden of serving as an anchor's comic foil or masquerading as the viewer's 
best friend. No Willards are in sight, no small talk is heard. No hippy-dippy 
weather allowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than entertainers, these are explainers who, despite their smiles and 
good posture, seem imbued with a devout, even dweebish sense of mission. They 
never upstage the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all business," says Weather Channel chief Michael Eckert. "We want to 
give good information and satisfy a variety of consumer segment needs." 
</P>
<P>
 He ticks off a few of the many faces a Weather Channel viewer might wear: the 
vacationer, business traveler, weekend athlete, aviator, farmer, boating 
enthusiast, construction worker. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have viewers who tune in for periods of severe weather only," he says, 
"and people who are interested in seeing what conditions are like where their 
loved ones live. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people who are fascinated with the weather and watch for two hours 
at a time, and people who will watch us for 15 seconds just to get a local hit 
and then move on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Weather Channel even counts among its viewership the gambler, Eckert adds: 
"After all, here's a guy who's wondering, will it rain on that racetrack or 
that football field?" 
</P>
<P>
 But not satisfied just to be a cable TV resource, the Weather Channel aims to 
merchandise its weather information in a manner reminiscent of how Disney 
peddles its rodents and ducks. 
</P>
<P>
 Already a Weather Channel radio service can be heard on about 220 stations, 
and you can dial a 900 phone number for "the Weather Channel Connection" at 95 
cents a minute. After airing on the Weather Channel, a series of half-hour 
documentaries (a recent one was "D-Day: Forecast for Victory") has found brisk 
home-video sales. 
</P>
<P>
 A companion Weather Channel providing nonstop local information is being 
tested in a dozen cities. At the other end of the scale, spinoff Weather 
Channels in the future may serve countries around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
 And with Weather Channel data already flowing into your cable box, you can 
look forward to interactive weather information on demand. Log in what you plan 
to do and where you plan to be, and download a customized weathercast.

PALM LATITUDES: IN EXCESS; PAIN, PAIN, GO AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Howlett 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flat on her back in the hospital a few weeks ago, Jenny's answer to pain 
relief was at her fingertips. Now it's at her throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny had been screaming in agony after abdominal surgery when doctors gave 
her a self-regulated IV so she could adminster her own narcotic painkillers. It 
was magic. 
</P>
<P>
 But when she left the hospital, Jenny (not her real name) began to worry about 
something she'd never faced before: addiction. "I kept thinking about Liz 
Taylor, and now Don Johnson. This can be serious. I don't want to be on drugs 
forever," Jenny says. 
</P>
<P>
 Many hospital patients confront the same fear. After being tended by doctors 
and nurses who quell their suffering with pills and IV drugs, they go home only 
find themselves staring at the label on their prescription bottles, terrified 
of what doctors now call "dependency." 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, Jenny's doctors didn't just hand her a bottle of Vicodin and 
wave goodby. Like an increasing number of hospitals and physicians, they 
referred her to a pain management specialist to help her juggle pain and drugs. 
There are dozens of local facilities that specialize in helping people cope 
with pain, most of them focusing on chronic pain. In the last few years, 
though, more of them have been helping post-op patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Jenny's first visit was typical: A doctor interviewed her to evaluate her 
potential for addiction, then made a prescription. "He kept saying, 'I'm not 
going to cut you off,' but I was used to the pain relief from all these drugs 
in the hospital," she says. "Sometimes I think you need help getting off them." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very complex issue," says Dr. Fred Nowroozi, head of the Fountain 
Valley-based Center for Excellence in Pain Manangement. "But the incidents of 
addiction in people that have never been addicted is very minimal." 
</P>
<P>
 Minimal, maybe, but nurses at the Betty Ford Center say they see their fair 
share of patients trying to get the doctor-prescribed monkey off their backs. 
"I've seen it start as benign as oral surgery or a tooth extration, and later 
down the line, they get addicted," says Virgina Robertson, a nurse at the 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 So difficult can this be that Jenny, even with the guidance of doctors trained 
specifically in the field, had to check into a drug rehabilitation center just 
weeks after her surgery. She says the bout with pain and pain management is not 
an easy one to win. "It's tougher than it looks, but I don't want to be doing 
this for the rest of my life." Susan Howlett

THE SECRET LIFE OF FURNITURE; OBJECTS OF DESIRE: THE LIVES OF ANTIQUES AND 
THOSE WHO PURSUE THEM, BY THATCHER FREUND (PANTHEON: $24; 291 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kathie Jenkins, Kathie Jenkins is a Times staff writer and former antiques 
dealer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The urge to collect starts early in life -- one Barbie doll soon leads to 
another and another, and, before you know it, you've got a whole drawerful of 
the 11 1/2-inch arched-eyebrowed, plastic, pony-tailed teen-agers. A hobby has 
become a habit. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no bounds when it comes to collecting. All you need is the courage 
of your convictions and a little cash, or a lot, if you are one of the people 
who flock to New York every January for the Americana auctions and the Winter 
Antiques Show on Park Avenue held the same week. A dealer spends as much as 
$30,000 in fees to sell at the glitzy Americana show. This is actually cheap, 
considering the number of people who might spend $1 million on a single piece 
of American furniture, including Eddy Nicholson, former chairman of the 
Congoleum Corp., actor Bill Cosby and Dallas billionaire Robert Bass, who once 
paid $12.1 million for a Newport secretary-bookcase. Even with $30,000, it's 
not easy to become a seller at that show: A dealer currently exhibiting there 
would first have to die. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Objects of Desire: The Lives of Antiques and Those Who Pursue Them," 
Thatcher Freund focuses on three pieces of 18th-Century American furniture on 
offer during a single day in January, 1991: a blue blanket chest that once 
stored socks and underwear, offered at the Winter Antiques Show for $245,000; a 
rare ball-and-claw-foot Chippendale card table, forgotten for 60 years in a 
dark basement until the grandson of its original owner discovered it, estimated 
to bring $1 million at the Americana auction at Sotheby's, and a federal 
inlaid, drop-leaf sofa table, a prized piece from a Massachusetts collector 
forced by the recession to sell his antiques, valued at $100,000, also on 
display at Sotheby's. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things lead lives like people do," writes Freund (ungrammatically!), "and 
they prosper, like people, on the strength of their character." 
</P>
<P>
 While "Objects of Desire" is partly about antiques and immortality, it is 
really a story about collectors and why they'll do practically anything to 
remain in the hunt. Judging from the cast of characters Freund introduces, you 
get the impression that a prized table is no different from a prized terrier. 
What's really at stake are egos, and the need to win. 
</P>
<P>
 Freund writes about Joseph Hirshhorn, the 5-foot, 3-inch uranium magnate, who 
would shout: "How much is this? How much is this? How much is that? How much 
for the whole lot?" and buy 40 or 50 things at once. He writes about 
Connecticut antiques dealer David Schorsch, who shopped at Mr. Guy of Beverly 
Hills because that's where Jeopardy host Alex Trebeck got his clothes. A 
blockfront-furniture expert by the age of 7, Schorsch paid outrageous prices 
for American folk art just to get people to notice him. 
</P>
<P>
 Great antiques, like great dogs, are valued for provenance. And certain 
collectors and dealers trade on that allure. About Mario Buatta, the "Prince of 
Chintz" decorator who single-handedly turned the Winter Antiques Show into a 
major social event, Freund describes a panel discussion Buatta moderated. Three 
hundred women paid $35 a piece to listen to famous decorators discuss 
decorating with antiques. "(The ladies) seemed to care less about what made one 
antique unique and another not, than about the way such things fit together. 
They wanted history right then. They didn't want to wait two hundred years to 
have it. Mario Buatta was happy to oblige. He knew it was his job not to help 
others connect to the past, but to invent a past. 'A lot of us didn't inherit 
these things,' he explained that day to his admirers. 'But we want our houses 
to look that way. That's what we all want to strive for.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The author knows it too. He also knows certain individuals will do just about 
anything to buy -- and even more to sell -- a piece of the past. He tells of 
auctioneers who pretend to have other bidders when there are none. He tells of 
how a Sotheby's deal with an old-monied family to sell the $1 million card 
table required full-page color ads of the table in antique magazines, a meal to 
be served to the family by Sotheby's chef Bernard, a suite of four rooms to be 
taken at the Carlyle Hotel and catalogues to be mailed free to the widow for 
life. He writes about dealers who distract the competition at auctions to keep 
prices down. And he describes how some Ohio dealers discovered that while they 
had no trouble finding antiques made by Ohio craftsmen, few people actually 
wanted them; "As a result . . . when clients asked about a piece, the dealer 
would sometimes say, 'The people who owned it moved from Pennsylvania.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The book has its faults. Freund plows back and forth in time, filling in the 
historical gaps with theories. Instead of identifying the owner of the 
Chippendale table, Freund refers to him coyly as "a man whom we will call Tom 
Hughes. The Hugheses come from the sort of old Philadelphia family that prefers 
not to see its name printed in any context besides those of marriage and death, 
and asks researchers to oblige." Oh, really. And perhaps they got no thrill 
from seeing their furniture biographied in this book? 
</P>
<P>
 And where are the pictures? Two of the pieces of furniture are shown on the 
jacket, but the other is covered in sheeting. It would be nice also to see what 
some of the collectors and dealers look like. 
</P>
<P>
 Freund's portrait of the antiques world -- the craftsmen, the wealthy, 
eccentric collectors, the rough, competitive dealers characterized by ego and 
obsession is a clever examination of an incurable disease. Reading about 
antiques, though, is not nearly as much fun as buying them. Still, it's better 
than having to walk a Schnauzer.

AT HOME IN THE WORLD; JULIP, BY JIM HARRISON (HOUGHTON MIFFLIN/SEYMOUR 
LAWRENCE: $21.95; 275 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kelly Cherry, Kelly Cherry is a poet, fiction writer and essayist whose most 
recent book is God's Loud Hand, a collection of poems. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How life gets into art is mysterious and miraculous. A writer shapes some 
fictional clay, breathes a few words and then -- maybe! -- the clay stands up 
and goes for a walk. Jim Harrison's new book, "Julip," performs this amazing 
act of creation three times, in three novellas that seize us by the hand and 
take us on three different paths through the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In the title novella, we experience the world among women; in "The Seven-Ounce 
Man" we experience a Native American world; and in "The Beige Dolorosa" we 
visit a largely Latino world. What is surpassingly wonderful is that all three 
fictional experiences are so lively. Rollicking and sad, hilarious and 
startlingly sweet smart and never cynical, these are stories that remind us no 
life should be overlooked or taken for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first novella "Julip," a young woman who trains dogs and keeps three 
older men on a tighter leash than they know, is not "particularly pretty or 
classically handsome" but "vivid, immediate, and (has) almost involuntarily 
filled out her life to its limits, moment by moment, with a rare emotional 
energy." She is determined to have her brother, Bobby, moved from prison -- 
where he is doing 7-to-10 for shooting and wounding three lovers -- to a mental 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 To do this, she must visit various people, including the lovers, a 
photographer, a painter and a writer, referred to collectively as "the Boys." 
The Boys, despite being middle-aged and successful, are boys. "When camera, 
paintbrush, and pen were put aside, they were right out there in la-la land 
with the Bloomingdale's teenyboppers." They are "unquestionably kind and 
generous," but desire -- a nameless desire, a vague American hankering for 
something different, something better or else simply more -- has permanently 
befuddled them, and apparently they eye Julip as a possible fulfillment of that 
desire. Julip is smart, and how she accomplishes her mission and leaves the 
Boys behind is the witty trajectory of this fast-moving narrative. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Seven-Ounce Man" continues the adventures of Brown Dog, who previously 
appeared in Harrison's "The Woman Lit by Fireflies." Brown Dog might be 
described as a first-rate underachiever. He's a hormone-addled happy-go-lucky 
sometime pulp-cutter in Michigan's Upper Peninsula whose most recent run-in 
with the law revolves around the illicit transportation of a fossilized Indian 
corpse. His intention had been to protect a Native graveyard from scientific 
excavation. Brown Dog is always well-intentioned -- to the extent that he is 
capable of intention. Mostly, he lives from day to day, and it is his innate 
knack for relishing each day in turn that wins a reader to his side. Wanted by 
assorted law officers, social workers, journalists, relatives and girlfriends' 
boyfriends and husbands, he never fails to appreciate "a big nature day." Brown 
Dog, although not an Indian, nevertheless feels honor-bound to risk all to 
defend the burial site, and ends up becoming part of the Wild Wild Midwest Show 
-- a concept that still makes me laugh out loud. 
</P>
<P>
 The last narrative gives us Phillip Caulkins, a 50-year-old divorced professor 
whose career has been overturned by a charge of sexual harassment. Where this 
story might have bogged down in academic discourse or in recycled satirical 
potshots, Harrison offers a touching portrait of a man reinventing himself. 
Caulkins' daughter sets him up on her in-laws' ranch in southeast Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 There, he reviews his life until he begins to be aware of the new life he is 
leading -- outdoors, riding horses, mending fences. Not to mention 
rediscovering sex and tangling with drug smugglers. "I meant to get rid of my 
personality which insisted on maintaining a world that no longer existed. . . . 
I must reshape myself to fully inhabit the earth." He also has a dream in which 
he is told to attach new names to the birds, because "so many of the current 
names of birds are humiliating and vulgar. . . . The thrasher is now called the 
'beige dolorosa,' which is reminiscent of a musical phrase in Mozart, one that 
makes your heart pulse with mystery, as does the bird." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the "otherness" of birds that intrigues and attracts Caulkins, as it is, 
one suspects, the otherness of these characters that has intrigued the author. 
I can imagine a reader who might be offended at the author's excursions into 
ethnic and sexual territories that are not his home place, but I cannot imagine 
taking such a reader seriously. There is no slumming among subcultures here. 
Like Caulkins, one may feel "at home, whether I deserved to or not." 
</P>
<P>
 These three novellas work beautifully together, composing a true triptych 
whose panels complete and comment upon one another. Motifs and references 
recur, patterning a book as artistically whole as it is emotionally 
revivifying.

 SONGS MY MOTHER TAUGHT ME: Stories, Plays and Memoir by Wakako Yamauchi, 
edited by Garrett Hongo (The Feminist Press: $14.95; 257 pp., paperback 
original). In her highly acclaimed fiction, Yamauchi examines the bleak lives 
of women struggling to preserve Japanese traditions in American settings. Her 
spare, highly condensed prose evokes the complex emotions that run beneath the 
surface of mundane lives; the characters "yearn for a more forgiving land, a 
truer love, and we huddle together for comfort and protection." Her writing is 
so tightly compressed that two of her brief stories have been expanded into the 
plays, "And the Soul Shall Dance" and "The Music Lessons."

 DOROTHEA LANGE: American Photographs by Therese Thau Heyman, Sandra S. 
Phillips & John Szarkowski (Chronicle Books: $24.95; 192 pp., paperback 
original). Lang rejected the notion that a photographer could be a "neutral" 
observer, and her commitment to social justice is reflected in her choice of 
subjects. During the '30s and '40s, she prepared dramatic studies of labor 
activists in San Francisco, impoverished migrant farm workers, black 
sharecroppers in the South and Japanese-Americans undergoing forced relocation. 
The program from an exhibit at the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, 
"American Photographs" presents a stark record of social change.

 LOS ANGELES: An Architectural Guide by David Gebhard & Robert Winter 
(Gibbs-Smith: $21.95; 486 pp., illustrated, paperback original). This thorough 
guide covers a broad spectrum of styles, from turn-of-the-century Beaux Arts 
offices to '90s condo complexes.The authors' balanced view of the eclectic 
architecture of Southern California offers a welcome change from the standard 
collections of superlatives. Gebhard and Winter praise MOCA as "unquestionably 
one of the most beautiful buildings erected in Los Angeles in the past four or 
five decades," but note that its layout "seems at times a bit strange;" they 
complain that the over-scaled Robert O. Anderson building at LACMA feels like 
"an upscale shopping mall." A handy reference to have in the glove compartment 
when out of town friends visit.

 MILES FROM NOWHERE: In Search of the American Frontier by Dayton Duncan 
(Penguin: $11.95; 320 pp., illustrated) and KILL THE COWBOY: A Battle of 
Mythology in the New West by Sharman Apt Russell (Addison-Wesley: $12; 217 
pp.). Duncan roamed 132 counties in the contiguous states with fewer than two 
people per square mile, talking to the inhabitants. He argues that the Frontier 
didn't close, but has shifted from a linear boundary to a scattered collection 
of underpopulated areas. Duncan sees the beauty of the wide open spaces -- and 
the social tensions in flyspeck towns where everyone knows everyone else's 
business. Huge tracts of land in the empty counties are administered by the 
Federal government, and Russell offers an informal introduction to the 
controversy over the use of these lands. The environmental consequences of 
grazing cattle on public land, the fees for grazing permits and the 
mis-administration of the BLM, the Forest Service, et al. are the focus of 
increasingly angry debates. Regrettably, Russell's examination devolves into a 
touchy-feely call for "Green Woman" spirituality that contributes precious 
little to an important policy question.

 FAREWELL MY CONCUBINE by Lillian Lee, translated from the Chinese by Andrea 
Lingenfelter (HarperPerennial: $9; 255 pp.). Lee co-wrote the screenplay for 
Chen Kaige's film version of her epic tale of two Peking Opera stars.The brash 
Duan Xiaolou portrays swaggering heroes; Cheng Dieye is a dan, who performs 
female roles. When they meet as boys in a brutal theatrical school, Xiaolou 
protects the delicate Dieye. But as they mature, Dieye confuses friendship and 
passion, a mistake that brings the two men into conflict when Xiaolou weds. 
Dieye and Xiaolou manage to survive the social upheavals that have convulsed 
China during the 20th Century, including the Japanese occupation and the 
Cultural Revolution. The sorrow and oppression they endure strengthens the bond 
between them, as heat tempers steel. Reflecting on the lives of actors, Lee 
notes grimly, "Once the curtain goes up they have to perform the play from 
beginning to end. They have nowhere to hide."

 A REASONABLE LIFE: Toward a Simpler, Secure, More Humane Existence by Ferenc 
Mate (Albatross: $9.95; 259 pp., paperback original). In his condemnation of 
the excessive consumption of energy and resources by the industrialized 
nations, Ferenc Mate declares, "To achieve the North American dream we have 
almost single-handedly propelled all living things on this planet -- including 
ourselves -- down the road to oblivion." He presents the case for leading more 
ecologically sane lives in conversational prose. But Mate's proposal that North 
Americans should try to realize his idealized vision of a family farm and grow 
their own food is a damn fool notion that ignores the realities of life in the 
later 20th Century.

 Saturday, July 24 at Plummer Park, the Lesbian Reading Series sponsored by A 
Different Light Bookstore features New York writer Eileen Myles, who does the 
unusual and memorable feat of reciting from memory the first four or five pages 
of a personal essay entitled, "My Father's Alcoholism." In cut-offs and 
T-shirt, Myles the incurable tomboy looks us in the eye and tells us her story, 
sentence after preformed sentence. Sometimes, not often, she falters, then 
remembers. The essay, remarkable for evoking the horrors and horrific 
amusements of an alcoholic household, has a strong voice. It is Myles' voice, 
but it is her writer's voice, definitely more shaped and modulated than the 
improvisation of daily speech. Suddenly he was roaring drunk. He was white. He 
was red. Myles' recitation, neither performance nor acting, kicks up questions: 
Does memorizing lend more immediacy to the hearing of the work? Should memory, 
shaped into prose, be re-memorized? 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Myles picks up the book and begins to read: "I only memorized so 
far," she says cheerfully. I, for one, am relieved to have the old familiar 
page conventionally lodged between reader and audience. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, July 31 is clear and hot, a good day to drive to the Ballona Wetlands 
to hear a reading in the Lannan Foundation's poetry garden. Today's readers are 
winners in the 1994 National Poetry Series contest. Founded in 1978 by poet 
Daniel Halpern with seed money from novelist James Michener, the Series asks 
five established poets to select five less-established poets for the award. 
Through a Lannan Foundation grant, publishers are found for the winners' books, 
winners receive a cash award equivalent to a small royalty advance, and are 
flown to Los Angeles for the reading we've come to hear. The program is varied. 
Traditional formal concerns seem paramount, although political and moral issues 
seep in, along with a universal fondness for the ironic and the arcane. 
</P>
<P>
 The Series has a reputation for selecting artists well worth reading: Past 
winners include Denis Johnson, Stephen Dobyns, Thylias Moss and Mark Doty among 
many others. These particular winners may not be well known yet, but over 200 
people have gathered in the garden to hear them. The atmosphere is like that of 
a wedding: There is something virginal and celebratory about the event which, 
for four of the five authors, marks the publication of a first book. 
</P>
<P>
 The first reader, chosen by Gloria Vando, is Rafael Campo, a graduate of 
Harvard Medical School currently interning at UC San Francisco. Campo writes 
about his AIDS patients in Roethkean rhythms and dedicates a poem to Marilyn 
Hacker, whose recent dismissal as editor from the Kenyon Review has been widely 
criticized. Next, Martin Edmunds, selected by Donald Hall, smooths the pages of 
his book, "The High Road to Taos," with clenched fists and reels off lines of 
impacted imagery and music: The wind is a green fire. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Maxine Kumin selected journalist Karen Swenson, a poised, 50ish woman who read 
poems about a killing field in Cambodia and an orangutan rehab center in Burma. 
Rachel Wetzsteon, John Hollander's choice, is a lanky and unassuming young 
woman who explains Sapphic stanzas (lest her meter sound "weird") and, after 
reading a dark love poem, exclaims at her own cynicism. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrapping up almost two hours of poetry is Kevin Young, selected by Lucille 
Clifton. Young, a Stegner Poetry fellow at Stanford, reads about growing up in 
Louisiana, his cousins and how a hair-straightening hot comb smells like 
burning lilacs.

DEFENDING E. LYNN HARRIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There were a number of statements with which I strongly disagreed in David 
Ehrenstein's piece on E. Lynn Harris' novels "Invisible Life" and "Just As I 
Am" (July 10) -- that Harris lacks a sense of humor, that he does not movingly 
and convincingly deal with the subject of AIDS, that the African-American 
community is hostile to the gay and lesbian movement. But my overriding concern 
is that Ehrenstein failed to give readers of your newspaper an actual review of 
either book. 
</P>
<P>
 In his rush to put his agenda on the table, the reviewer managed to write an 
article that maligned African Americans (gay and straight), "serious 
gay/lesbian African-American literature," book publishing, bookselling, 
best-sellers, Gus Van Sant's backers, Japanese housewives. And I was still not 
enlightened about even the plots of Harris' novels. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the review, I felt I was watching news tape of an infuriated 
U.S. auto worker with a sledge hammer in his hand standing over the shattered 
body of a Toyota. 
</P>
<P>
 And where do Harris' fine, honest, perceptive novels about contemporary 
African-American people struggling with human problems fall in all this tirade? 
Unfortunately for readers of your section, the answer is: Right through the 
cracks. 
</P>
<P>
 TINA MCELROY ANSA, ST. SIMONS ISLAND, GA.

</P>
<P>
 As Vice President and Publisher of Anchor Books, I was saddened to read David 
Ehrenstein's review of E. Lynn Harris' novels, since he very clearly disliked 
them. Response to fiction is quite subjective, and Mr. Ehrenstein is entitled 
to his opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Since, however, so many of his negative comments were about the publication of 
the books rather than the books themselves, I thought it appropriate to write a 
response. 
</P>
<P>
 I was intrigued by his interpretation of the jacket of "Just As I Am," which 
shows two men embracing with a woman standing alone off to the side. Our 
intention was twofold: 1) to make it clear that the novel was about love 
between two black men, and 2) to let Mr. Harris' female audience (who were big 
supporters of "Invisible Life") know that there was a woman character in this 
book. What's wrong with straight women being interested in gay men's lives? How 
many other current novels by gay men -- black or white -- feature two men so 
clearly romantically involved? I thought it was rather bold. 
</P>
<P>
 Why can't book buyers have the option of reading Randall Kenan, Audre Lorde 
and E. Lynn Harris? There are all kinds of readers so there should be a full 
spectrum of literary and commercial books for them to read. And, by the way, 
when was Mr. Ehrenstein last in a major chain bookstore? I think a quick peek 
into any Borders (Walden) or Barnes & Noble superstore would show that the 
works of Essex Hemphill, Audre Lorde, Melvin Dixon, June Jordan and a host of 
other gay and lesbian African-American authors are readily available. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, it is simply not true that "serious gay/lesbian African-American 
literature is part of the ghetto . . . left to specialty and university 
presses." I hardly think the W. W. Norton (Audre Lorde), Harcourt Brace 
(Randall Kenan), NAL/Plume (Melvin Dixon) or Pantheon (June Jordan) could be 
classified as small presses.

 An addendum to Dave Foreman's book review of "Epitaph For a Desert Anarchist" 
("Anarchist With an Attitude" July 17).

<P>
 Edward Abbey began shaking up the Establishment back in college at the 
University of New Mexico.He was editor of the campus literary magazine the 
Thunderbird in 1950 when I was editor of the campus paper the Lobo. Ed created 
a big stir with a purported quote on the Thunderbird cover from Louisa May 
Alcott: "Man will never be free until the last judge is strangled with the 
entrails of the last priest." 
</P>
<P>
 The UNM honchos were thrown into an uproar. In Catholic-conscious New Mexico 
(after all, the region was settled starting in the 1500s by Catholic 
Spaniards), UNM brass feared a cut in appropriations from vindictive Catholics 
in the state legislature. Not much happened, really. The flap blew over.

 Re: your article on Abbey; specifically the boxed introductory commentary to 
Abbey's last journal entry. In answer to the writer's oh-so-correct, 
oh-so-pedestrian, oh-so-predictable question: political correctitude, always. 
</P>
<P>
 My question to the writer: to which of Abbey's "anxious particular" sects or 
factions do you belong? One of them, some of them, all of them? Some people 
will just never get it.

that's the difference between talent and genius."

 In the movie, "Rhapsody in Blue," the overnight train trip was filmed, but the

SATURN V BLUEPRINTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his review of several books on the Apollo space program (Book Review, July 
3, 1994), writer Terry Bisson claims, "Neither America nor Russia could (put a 
man on the moon) today. The blueprints for the F-1 engines are lost . . . " The 
belief that the blueprints for the Saturn V engines (and the rocket itself) 
have been lost is nothing more than a continually propagated misconception. 
</P>
<P>
 The blueprints for the Saturn V rocket are stored on microfilm at Marshall 
Space Flight Center, and the Federal Archives in East Point, Ga., also house 
2,900 cubic feet of Saturn documents. Rocketdyne has archived dozens of volumes 
from its Knowledge Retention Program, which was initiated in the late '60s to 
document every facet of F-1 and J-2 engine production and assist in any future 
restart. 
</P>
<P>
 The main problem in re-creating a Saturn V rocket would not be in locating the 
blueprints, but in finding vendors who could still supply the hardware. And 
even if we were to go to the trouble of building another Saturn V, we still 
wouldn't have any place to launch it from, as all the available launch pads 
have been converted for use with the Space Shuttle.

 Talk about a change of scene. If he were alive today, actor John Barrymore 
probably wouldn't recognize his former West Hollywood estate. Where a red-tiled 
Mediterranean-style villa once stood at Sunset and Olive, Hard Rock Cafe 
co-founder Isaac Tigrett has built a rambling, three-story Delta-style spread 
called House of Blues to serve up soulful blues, African-American folk art and 
Southern home cookin'. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebrity-backed venture (the first two House of Blues nightclubs are in 
Cambridge, Mass., and New Orleans, and investors include Dan Aykroyd and Jim 
Belushi) opened only three months ago, but parts of this 30,000-square-foot 
outpost -- like the corrugated-tin exterior -- go way back. Tigrett, an avid 
blues fan from Tennessee, grew up chauffeuring Memphis bluesmen Furry Lewis and 
Bukka White around town. During trips home, he had seen an old cotton gin near 
"the crossroads," the junction of highways 61 and 49 outside Clarksdale, Miss., 
where legend has it that blues great Robert Johnson made a pact with the devil 
in exchange for talent and fame. In February, Tigrett bought the gin's battered 
siding, plus two truckloads of "crossroads" dirt that lie under the stage, and 
shipped it all to the Sunset Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the weathered roadhouse facade, the interior is an eye-popping mix of 
color, pattern and texture. Scenic artist Brent Spears painted ceilings and 
walls, peppering every surface with stars, stripes and an assortment of 
childlike doodles. For example, the paneled doors of the Take It Easy Baby 
Blues Accessories retail store (merchandise ranges from vintage Gruhn guitars 
and blues CDs to folk art and furniture) are painted with red cabbage roses on 
a field of blue polka dots. Spears never planned any of the designs, he says: 
"I made them up as I went along. It's about painting a feeling -- it just flows 
out of me." 
</P>
<P>
 A 55-foot-long bar decorated by artist Jon Bok is the focal point of the 
restaurant. The footrest consists of 1934 California license plates recycled 
from a roof; the sides and top are covered with bottle caps, thrift-shop 
portraits and hundreds of hand-painted metal skeletons that Bok fashioned from 
cans. "I eat a lot of Campbell's soup," he says. Between 9 and 10 every night, 
the bar swings open and rotates 90 degrees to reveal a stage below and a 
proscenium arch studded with religious symbols and a sign proclaiming "Unity in 
Diversity." Overhead, a ceiling by English sculptor Andrew Wood features a 
pantheon of blues artists in bas-relief. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, the club takes a decidedly Indian-Colonial turn in a series of 
private lounges and dining areas for sponsors of the International House of 
Blues Foundation, a nonprofit educational network that teaches history through 
art and music. On one of his trips to India, Tigrett encountered a maharajah 
dismantling his palace, so ornate architectural remnants from there and 
elsewhere abound: A 400-year-old Indian doorway of hand-carved wood announces 
the main lounge; 500-pound wood corbels adorn the bar. African-American folk 
art hangs on nearly all the walls, which are also lined with vintage Indian 
quilts for a zany juxtaposition of colors and continents. Elaborate plaster 
ceilings were reproduced with molds from the Biltmore Hotel. The indoor dining 
area, supervised by former La Toque chef Ken Frank, sports floor-to-ceiling 
mahogany paneling from a turn-of-the century English steamer. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Hollywood billboards and swaying palms, the ramshackle-looking house 
that Isaac built resonates with sound and color, a celebration of 
African-American music and folk art.

STYLE: GARDENS; DISORDER IN THE COURT

 Today's boldest gardens are often highly structured yet explosive, using order 
as a backdrop for lively chaos. Artist Nancy A. Kintisch of Atwater Village 
found that this approach suited her Moroccan-style house.From street to 
doorway, the grounds of her little 1920s castle combine the control of Islamic 
design with the unruliness of an English cottage plot.  
</P>
<P>
 A painter, muralist and tile artist, Kintisch applied color and form like 
brushstrokes. Low walls enlarged the planting area and defined the sloping lot. 
Alphonse Karr bamboo and eucalyptus-wood gates (by landscape designer Frank 
Perrino) provide privacy. The front path, inlaid with tile, suggests a Persian 
carpet surrounding a rosette of rosemary. The four beds teem with blooms: 
antique and David Austin roses, daylilies, hollyhocks, poppies and a host of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 As it climbs the front steps into the entry court, Kintisch's tilework 
intensifies. Its antic, random pattern of Mexican pavers and handmade ceramic 
tiles by Peter King and Marni Jaime of Pensacola, Fla., links the garden to the 
home's interior. "In this tiny house," Kintisch says, "there's great attention 
to detail. The garden had to match that." SUSAN HEEGER

ARCHITECTURE; REBUILT TO TILT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When remodeling a condominium, most architects concentrate all their efforts 
on the interior and never touch the exterior. But Santa Monica architect 
Barbara Coffman, a sculptor of intriguing spaces, brought a more complete 
vision to the Venice Beach condo of Philip and Madeline Schwarzman. 
</P>
<P>
 A stucco box from the early '70s, the building consisted of four floors of 
unremarkable rooms before Coffman "pulled in" the oceanfront windows from the 
structural frame. This created a wall of glass and wood that tilts and curves 
like an old-fashioned roller-coaster track. Seen from outdoors, the condo now 
looks almost organic, a seed pod growing inside an egg carton. Inside, the 
wave-like wall inspired similar contours in the living-dining area, 
particularly the undulating sofas, by Ellen and Michael Houpt of San Diego, and 
the buffet, by April Newman and Laurie Cesario of Santa Monica. Coffman's 
ingenuity also freed up space for a small balcony off the living room. 
</P>
<P>
 In a hallway leading to children's bedrooms and a study, the architect 
designed another area where "something is always happening as you walk 
through." The new passageway, once a corridor she likened to "a dark bowling 
alley," features niches carved out of the walls and a ceiling of various 
heights. Elsewhere, Coffman introduced other imaginative touches. In the master 
bathroom, for instance, where the walls remain unaltered, she surrounded the 
tub with unfinished flagstone slabs. 
</P>
<P>
 The architecture is bold and the color scheme, based on paintings by Matisse 
and Gauguin, is vibrant. Still, the Schwarzmans find their home restful -- an 
especially important consideration for Philip, an emergency-room physician. 
They also appreciate that Coffman didn't allow the design to be "swallowed up" 
by an overwhelming view of the ocean, as is often the case in beachfront 
properties. Says Philip: "We thought it would be good to make all parts of the 
house exciting." MORRIS NEWMAN

SAME SPIN, NEW CYCLE; A VISIT WITH THOMAS KELLER, FORMERLY OF L.A.'S CHECKERS, 
NOW IN THE NAPA VALLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A couple of years ago, Thomas A. Keller was a chef without a kitchen. He had 
just left Checkers, the elegant downtown hotel where, as executive chef, he had 
bemused Los Angeles with his daring, highly sophisticated American cooking. 
While considering his next move, he started work on a cookbook, launched an 
enormously successful, first-rate California olive oil called EVO -- and did a 
little traveling. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't know any of this the night I arrived for dinner at the home of Barolo 
producers Alfredo and Luciana Currado of Cantina Vietti in Piedmont. This 
corner of northwestern Italy is one of the world's great gastronomic regions, 
home to two of Italy's finest red wines, Barbaresco and Barolo, and to a 
distinct and original regional cuisine. The lanky American at the far end of 
the table who had pitched in to prepare vegetables for the big bagna cauda , 
the famous Piedmontese "hot bath" of olive oil, garlic and anchovies, turned 
out to be Thomas Keller. And it was the Currados who had helped arrange for the 
Los Angeles chef to work in several top Piedmontese restaurants during his 
visit. At one place, the chef so admired Keller's stylishly tailored chef's 
jacket that he proposed a trade: one bottle of the legendary Romano Levi's 
grappa for the garment. Before Keller could say yes, the owner, who also 
fancied the jacket, popped his head in the kitchen and offered two bottles of 
the rare grappa. Offer accepted. Now Keller was not only without a kitchen; he 
didn't have a jacket either. 
</P>
<P>
 The next time I saw Keller, he had settled down in another renowned wine 
region, the Napa Valley. Seated at a table at the edge of the herb garden at 
the historic French Laundry in Yountville, wearing black clogs, long legs 
crossed, he looked completely contented as he poured coffee from a tall French 
pressoir. After a year and a half of working on the project, Keller had just 
acquired one of the Napa Valley's most beloved restaurants, and after a modest 
renovation, he had reopened it the week before. "Finally, I can just cook and 
not be constantly called away for meetings when I'm about to go into the 
kitchen," says Keller, referring to his hotel experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cooks would give anything to get out of the kitchen and become an 
executive chef. Not Keller. He couldn't wait to leave all that behind and 
realize his dream: his own small restaurant near vineyards. "For a chef to do 
what he wants to do," says Keller, "Napa Valley is the perfect place. People 
come here for one reason: that's to learn about wine and food." He envisions 
the French Laundry as a sort of gastronomic retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 The simple two-story stone structure, now designated a national historic site, 
was built originally as a steam laundry in the early 1900s. When Yountville 
residents Don and Sally Schmitt turned it into a restaurant in 1977, they named 
it the French Laundry. Like Alice Waters, who had opened Chez Panisse in 
Berkeley six years before, the Schmitts served just one menu each evening. 
Meals at the French Laundry unfolded at a leisurely pace, but that was part of 
its charm. The table, they would always assure you, was yours for the evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The French Laundry is a very special place to me, as it was to the Schmitts 
and to the Napa Valley," says Keller. "I wanted to continue that." Instead of 
turning the tables two or three times a night, as he did in New York and Los 
Angeles, Keller turns them, at most, once. He intends to keep the prix fixe 
menu, but he'll offer four or five choices within each course. "Sally's 
original format of the five-course meal is perfect for me," he says. "If I'm 
going out to a restaurant, that's exactly the way I like to eat." He must be 
thinking of France, where the prix fixe menu is a fixture even at 
Michelin-starred restaurants and where he spent a year and a half working at 
some of the great restaurants in Paris. 
</P>
<P>
 The Napa Valley is a long way in spirit from the frenetic big city scene where 
Keller made his reputation, first at Rakel in New York and then at Checkers. In 
1988, he was named Best New American Chef by Food & Wine magazine. While chefs 
with pretensions to nouvelle were busy arranging everything on the plate to 
make a pretty picture, Keller's style was closer to sculpture, and some of his 
ephemeral structures of foie gras or fish were really more like architecture 
than anything else. Splashy, yes. But he also has an astute palate and the 
technical mastery to pull off his elaborate constructs. He is a confident cook, 
and as chef-owner for the second time in his 22-year, he can now cook exactly 
as he likes. His style is already more relaxed, though it's hardly what you'd 
call rustic. It's easy to see how much he's beginning to enjoy this new setting 
and the challenge of making the French Laundry his own. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, it's not all show. Our languid Sunday evening meal began with a 
palate teaser of Keller's fanciful shrimp "cocktail," a single shrimp perched 
on the edge of a martini glass filled with a confetti of vegetables and tomato 
water poured from a smart cocktail shaker. I started with the Piedmontese-style 
agnolotti , tiny succulent packets of dusky wild mushrooms. For the fish 
course, there was a marvelous line-caught Pacific salmon with stacked crispy 
potatoes, lemon-scented spinach leaves and a deep-flavored veal jus . 
</P>
<P>
 Dark-fleshed rare squab came with braised baby red mustard greens, sharp and 
intense, and a garnish of tempura-fried leaves. Keller likes to play with one 
element, presenting it several ways on one plate. For example, grilled Pacific 
sturgeon had a shallot glaze; onion powders decorated the plate, and he served 
the dish with a shot of shallot broth on the side. A juicy saddle of rabbit 
comes with its roasted kidney waving from a bamboo skewer flagpole. 
</P>
<P>
 "As someone finishes each course, I want them to wish they had one more bite 
of this, a little more of that, yet by the time they leave the table, they are 
more than satisfied," Keller says. I can vouch for that. By the time the 
cinnamon-dusted doughnut holes arrived with a cup of cappuccino semifreddo and 
I had a bite of the chocolate truffle cake with caramel cream, I couldn't 
manage the beautiful petits fours. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a brave man who opens a restaurant after cooking only a few days with 
his new staff of three. "We're learning to dance together," says Keller with a 
laugh. "Our first night, we were stepping on each other's toes. But we learned 
right away what we had to do and by the second night, we were right there." For 
the moment, it must be like trying to tango on a handkerchief-sized dance 
floor: The kitchen resembles a well-equipped home kitchen more than a 
professional one, with just one 10-burner stove, two ovens and very little 
counter space. Keller has added a larger two-door refrigerator, but it's hardly 
a walk-in. This winter, he plans to move the kitchen to the small building that 
now houses the wine. He'll dig out the basement to make a real wine cellar and 
put the new, larger kitchen above it. The old kitchen, which has the best view 
of the garden, will be opened up to the dining room, making the cozy 62-seat 
restaurant much more luxurious in terms of space. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the garden. Keller has already replaced most of the 
ornamental herbs with culinary varieties, and several local investors have 
promised an acre or two for a vegetable garden. Pointing out a small bay tree 
he just planted, Keller muses, "One of the wonderful aspects of this project is 
that I have a lot of time. I don't have to rush into anything." Back in the 
kitchen again, he looks happy. And in keeping with the laundry theme, another 
of his tailored chef's jackets now hangs in the dining room as the sole piece 
of decoration.

ON THE RECORD: SOMETIMES, THREE DOES NOT A TRIO MAKE

<P>
 Tchaikovsky's nearly 50-minute-long Trio in A minor for Piano, Violin and 
Cello is his chamber equivalent of the late symphonies: a dramatic, overtly 
emotional and self-revelatory display piece -- as showy an example as exists of 
the non-intimate uses to which the intimate muse can be put. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also star fodder, a score that can survive, even blossom, in the hands 
of virtuoso players going their own ways, with the proviso that their fingers 
and minds meet at crucial cadential junctures. Artur Rubinstein, Jascha Heifetz 
and Gregor Piatigorsky proved it could be done with their celebrated (but 
truncated) 1940s recording, reissued on CD a couple of years ago (RCA Victor 
7768, mid-price). 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Yefim Bronfman and violinist Cho-Liang Lin might be regarded as 
modern-day counterparts of RCA's stellar duo, while their partner, cellist Gary 
Hoffman is a lesser-known quantity. 
</P>
<P>
 Their encounter with the Tchaikovsky Trio (Sony 53 269) distinctly emerges as 
a series of individual turns, with Bronfman undermining his characterful, if 
rather fast-paced work with some momentum-shattering rubatos in the shorter of 
the work's two movements, the still vast "Pezzo Elegiaco." 
</P>
<P>
 The entry of Lin's sweet-toned, vibrato-laden violin should slow the pace but 
doesn't, and Hoffman seems recessive in this company. 
</P>
<P>
 The fitting companion piece is the more tautly constructed D- minor Trio of 
Anton Arensky, a Tchaikovsky sound-alike, energetically and unfussily presented 
by the same players. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more the sound of an ensemble in the Tchaikovsky Trio presented by 
another assemblage of free spirits: pianist Cecile Licad, violinist Nadja 
Salerno-Sonnenberg and cellist Antonio Meneses (EMI 54800). 
</P>
<P>
 The first movement is more smartly paced than Sony's, decidedly to the benefit 
of the music. Salerno-Sonnenberg's work is particularly strong and shapely 
here, Meneses' is elegant, and Licad's purposeful, if a shade overassertive 
here and there. 
</P>
<P>
 The coupling is the Brahms Trio, Opus 40, with hornist John Cerminaro setting 
the tone of relaxed warmth for Salerno-Sonnenberg (who begins unsteadily) and 
Licad. 
</P>
<P>
 There's more intensity -- without sacrificing the Brahmsian mellowness -- in a 
super-budget edition from Budapest (Naxos 55041) of the Horn Trio in which Jeno 
Kevehazi, tougher-toned than Cerminaro, joins the ubiquitous pianist Jeno Jando 
and an impressively powerful violinist named Ildiko Hegyi. 
</P>
<P>
 The disc further includes music by an obscure composer with a familiar name, 
Herzogenberg: not Elisabeth, Brahms' lifelong friend, but her husband, 
Heinrich. His pleasantly lightweight Trio, in the vein of Schumann's character 
pieces but with a "hunting" scherzo straight out of the Brahms Trio, is 
superbly delivered by oboist Jozsef Kiss, hornist Kevehazi and Jando. 
</P>
<P>
 The imaginative program is rounded out by what may be the ur -horn trio: a 
slender creation, circa 1800, by the French virtuoso and pedagogue Frederic 
Duvernoy. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Oistrakh Trio -- violinist David Oistrakh, cellist Sviatoslav 
Knushevitsky, pianist Lev Oborin, none of them with us any longer -- you had it 
all: individual virtuosity, ensemble cohesiveness, interpretive fire. 
</P>
<P>
 All those qualities are strikingly applied by these artists to the great 
Russian trio of the present century, Shostakovich's Opus 67, in a Chant du 
Monde/Praga release (254 054) of a 1961 live performance from the archives of 
the Czech Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The same CD offers stunningly accomplished, idiomatic readings of the 
Shostakovich Third and Fourth Quartets from, respectively, the Glinka and 
Taneyev Quartets, likewise from Czech Radio broadcasts. Not to be missed. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, a return engagement by the original Beaux Arts Trio, comprising 
pianist Menahem Pressler (who remains the linchpin of today's ensemble), 
violinist Daniel Guilet and cellist Bernard Greenhouse: Their 1965 set of the 
Beethoven Trios, still, to this listener's ears, is unsurpassed for their 
risk-taking energy and their grandeur, now superbly remastered and economically 
fitted onto three mid-priced CDs (Philips 438 948).

RECORD RACK: HE'S NOT BURNT OUT -- AND CERTAINLY NOT FADING AWAY

 ****; NEIL YOUNG & CRAZY HORSE, "Sleeps With Angels" ( Reprise ) 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Young is only a year away from joining Mick Jagger and Keith Richards in 
rock's 50-and-over club, yet there is little public questioning of his 
relevance in a post-Nirvana rock world governed creatively by the 
twentysomething alternative crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Truly rock's man for all ages, Young is as much a show stopper jamming with 
contemporary heroes Pearl Jam at the MTV Video Music Awards as on stage with 
rock's elder statesmen at a Bob Dylan tribute concert at Madison Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Young -- whose best music for a quarter century has combined a caressing, 
country-folk soulfulness with a ragged hard-rock fury -- seemed to be going in 
circles artistically during most of the '80s. But he has rebounded with four 
remarkably evocative studio albums in a row -- starting with 1989's "Freedom." 
</P>
<P>
 This hasn't been a case of simply reviving classic elements of an artist's 
style -- as in the case of the Rolling Stones' pleasing but none-too-revealing 
"Voodoo Lounge" album. Young's best recent tracks don't just remind us of his 
best work from the '70s -- they measure up to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Young's message in "Sleeps With Angels" again is ageless -- music about social 
concerns and private thoughts that, in key moments, is as soul-baring as 
anything he has done since 1975's "Tonight's the Night," perhaps his bravest 
and most enduring collection. 
</P>
<P>
 At varying points, he speaks with the maturity of someone who has fought back 
from disillusionment and despair. Elsewhere, he acknowledges the heartache and 
confusion of someone whose youthful innocence has been so shattered that he 
wonders if he'll ever recover his idealism and dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 The album's title song will likely get the most initial attention because it 
was written after Kurt Cobain's suicide last spring. Where some veteran rockers 
after Cobain's death said they couldn't understand a performer being so 
unsettled by fame that he would kill himself, Young sensed the depth of 
Cobain's struggle and was even trying to contact the Nirvana leader before the 
suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 So Young was horrified to see his own lyrics -- "It's better to burn out than 
to fade away" -- quoted in Cobain's suicide note. 
</P>
<P>
 Young had repeatedly disputed over the years interpretations linking that 1979 
song to a "live fast, love hard, die young" philosophy, much less a death wish. 
The idea, he stressed, is to not hold back in your art. 
</P>
<P>
 The song "Sleeps With Angels" is a disarming tale of bittersweet loss that is 
bathed in a guitar-dominated sonic intensity that links it, almost sweetly, to 
some of Nirvana's own searing textures. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rest of the album, most of which was written before Cobain's death, 
Young and the three musicians in Crazy Horse struggle with other forms of 
disillusionment, from social decay to private infidelities. 
</P>
<P>
 Through each step, they play with an almost spiritual purity, casting a wide 
array of sonic shadings that seem at every turn in perfect step with the 
emotions -- all the way from the psychedelic haze of the 14-minute "Change Your 
Mind" to the bratty rowdiness of "Piece of Crap." 
</P>
<P>
 But the heart of the album rests in its most tender moments, notably 
"Driveby," a reflection on the random killing of a young girl, and the closing 
"A Dream That Can Last," a song of renewed optimism and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the latter tune evokes the image of the dead young girl, the song, 
with its unbending optimism, is an expression of comfort and hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Sample lyrics: 
</P>
<P>
 I saw a young girl who didn't die  
</P>
<P>
 I saw a glimmer from in her eye  
</P>
<P>
 I saw the distance, I saw the past  
</P>
<P>
 And I know I won't awaken.  
</P>
<P>
 It's a dream that can last.  
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of this album is that you can imagine it providing comfort to 
someone as troubled as Cobain on one of those nights when life itself seems as 
dark as a moonless sky. The sadness that radiates through "Sleeps With Angels" 
is that Cobain, whose own music was such a comfort to his own generation, never 
got to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

RECORD RACK: NO SIGN OF ANYTHING SPECIAL FROM PRINCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ernest Hardy 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 ** 1/2; PRINCE, "Come" ( Warner Bros. ) 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't abuse children, or else they turn out like me," warns Prince on "Papa," 
one of the darker-themed tracks on the last studio album he recorded before 
changing his name to the symbol sign last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Revisiting classic Prince themes of sex, loneliness and social ills, this 
musically satisfying but lyrically uneven collection fails to gel into an 
effective whole the way the similarly themed "Sign 'O' the Times" or "1999" 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Papa," for instance, is surprisingly lightweight given the child-abuse theme, 
and it's further burdened by heavy-handed attempts at poetic imagery. Prince 
also muddles his way through "Race," a regressive leap from more insightful 
reflections on racial issues found in earlier albums. 
</P>
<P>
 When he steps away from the soapbox and into the boudoir, he is on more solid 
ground. On the sexy, grinding, classic R&B-flavored "Dark," a song about 
romantic rejection, he testifies, moans and wails along with funky 
instrumentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, his falsetto has never been sweeter than on the mournful, bluesy 
"Solo," which has the feel of an old spiritual. The libidinous title track, the 
mellow-vibed "Let It Go" and the honey-voiced "Space" all spotlight the same 
sturdy funk/R&B/rock groove that has been his trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the whole thing ends with the faked moans and groans of 
"Orgasm," a high-school level giggle-fest. This isn't near being a great Prince 
album; stricter editing at least could have made it a very good one. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

FOUR-STAR FILMS; 'I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG'

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mervyn LeRoy's stark 1932 drama, based on a true story about an innocent man 
sent to a brutal prison only to escape and become a criminal, still retains its 
raw power. Both the lead actor, Paul Muni (pictured), and the film received 
Oscar nominations. This was a key movie in establishing Warner Bros. as 
Hollywood's most socially conscious -- and also liveliest -- studio in the '30s 
(Showtime Monday at 2:55 p.m.).

CRITIC'S PICK: 'BRAM STOKER'S DRACULA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kevin Thomas 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This enjoyable 1992 release might be more aptly titled "Francis Coppola's 
Dracula."The director brings to the umpteenth retelling of Stoker's 1897 novel 
the grand operatic style of his "Godfather" movies plus considerable sensuality 
and an affectionate tongue-in-cheek play to the vampire tale. Gary Oldman is 
suitably world-weary as Dracula, and Winona Ryder (pictured, with Keanu Reeves 
as her suitor) is his winsome victim. The starry cast includes Anthony Hopkins 
and, most memorably, Tom Waits as Renfield, the grotesque early victim of the 
Transylvanian count. A lush period production: Eiko Ishioka won an Oscar for 
her opulent costumes (Cinemax Sunday at 9:30 p.m.). Kevin Thomas

CRITIC'S PICK: 'UNDER SIEGE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Michael Wilmington 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Director Andrew Davis and writer J.F. Lawton's 1992 hit is a high-tech 
thriller that takes its simple hook -- "Die Hard" on a battleship -- and keeps 
pouring on the blood and glitz, trying to blast you out of your seat.The hero, 
martial-arts star Steven Seagal, is so steely and robust that he looks like he 
could kill with his eyebrows. The heavies, Tommy Lee Jones and Gary Busey (both 
pictured), are a pair of wild clowns who crack jokes between massacres. But so 
does Seagal. Everything about this movie is over-scaled, over-brutal and full 
of holes -- yet there's something cheerfully wacky about it (HBO Sunday at 8 
p.m.). Michael Wilmington

CRITIC'S PICK: 'ANTONIA & JANE'

<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Beeban Kidron's 1991 movie is a pleasingly small-scale tale about two 
long-term friends played by Saskia Reeves (center, with Bill Nighy) and Imelda 
Staunton (right).They are polar opposites who admire and envy each other's 
spirit. At its best, this film manages to be both sedate and quirky. The joke 
in the material is that both women, who meet once a year for lunch, are 
patients of the same psychiatrist, so we get to see and hear about their 
connecting lives from opposing viewpoints (Cinemax Tuesday at 4:40 a.m.). Peter

WITH AN EYE ON . . . ; THE 'DREAM ON' KID GROWS UP, AND THAT FITS CHRIS 
DEMETRAL JUST FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Dream On's" Jeremy (Chris Demetral) is on the road to becoming more of a 
contemporary to dad Martin (Brian Benben) than a son. 
</P>
<P>
 In the five years that HBO's adult comedy has been on cable, Jeremy's grown 
from a twirp to a tempestuous young man. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Tupper, a Manhattan book editor, seems to change lovers with each 
episode, and it looks as if his son may follow in his fast tracks. Last season, 
an episode focused on Jeremy losing his virginity. Now he's tackling Dad's work 
world. This week's show, "Those Who Can't, Edit," focuses on Jeremy's first 
novel. And, as is often the case with Jeremy and Martin, a father-son battle 
ensues. 
</P>
<P>
 For Demetral, 17, however, real life is decidedly different. 
</P>
<P>
 "My relationship with my dad is nothing like Jeremy's and his dad's," Demetral 
says from the San Fernando Valley apartment he shares with his father and 
manager, Pete Demetral. "We get along great. He's my best friend and always has 
been." 
</P>
<P>
 Demetral has lived with his father since his parents' divorce when he was 3. 
He moved with his father from their native Michigan to California 10 years ago. 
(He visits Mom in Michigan three or four times a year, he says.) In the sunny 
state, the younger Demetral sought stardom. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always an entertainer, talking people's ears off, singing and dancing. 
I just knew I wanted to be an actor," Chris says. 
</P>
<P>
 At 10, he answered an open call for "Return of the Living Dead." "I was too 
young. I thought I'd be a good baby zombie or something," he deadpans. "But I 
got sent to an agent and got signed that day." Many guest roles followed. At 
12, he got the role of Jeremy on "Dream On," a comedy that quickly got the 
critics' attention for mixing old TV clips with the very modern goings-on of 
Tupper and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Demetral and Jeremy now have little in common. "When he first started out, 
Jeremy was almost exactly like me," Demetral recalls. "As he started to get 
more rebellious, he got less like me." 
</P>
<P>
 Even less like Demetral is Jack, the homeless teen he has been playing on 
"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman." He is looking forward to the 
series' fall return, though he doesn't know what's in store for his character. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a tough character and a wonderful change for me," Demetral says. 
Previous roles on "The Wonder Years" and "Blossom" have been far more 
conventional. 
</P>
<P>
 Demetral, his father, and Ron Wolotzky, a co-executive producer, are quick to 
point out that during "Dream On's" sexual scenes -- of which there are many -- 
Jeremy is never around. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's quite an adult environment," Wolotzky concedes. "It's the nature of the 
show; it caters to adults. But we've always made sure from the beginning that 
Chris not be exposed to those scenes. Even in a scene where it was Jeremy's 
P.O.V. (point of view), we only shot Chris' reaction shot. He wasn't really 
looking at anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolotzky says working around adults has contributed to Demetral's maturity: 
"He's really matured and can carry a conversation like any other adult. He's 
very friendly and open and appreciates what's done for him. He's really a 
wonderful all-around person." 
</P>
<P>
 For Demetral, it's been "a tremendous learning experience" that he hopes to 
parlay into more work. Fortunately for him, "Dream On's" shooting schedule 
works to his advantage. "That gives me time to work on other projects." 
</P>
<P>
 He's already penned a couple of treatments and is at work on a script. 
Meanwhile, he finds time to play basketball, his favorite sport, while staying 
focused on his goal of becoming an actor-writer-producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very involving," the teen says of acting. "You get into this mind set 
that there is always a possible audition, some wonderful part. You just have to 
be ready all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dream On" airs Wednesdays at 10 p.m. and repeats Saturday at 10 p.m. on HBO. 
"Lois & Clark: The New Adventures of Superman" airs Sunday s at 8 p.m. on ABC.

ON VIEW; 'SHE TV': COMIC ROLE REVERSALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The game show's called "What Do Women Want?" and the male contestant, Bob, is 
having trouble with the ground rules. So female host Jinx Mandell gives him a 
hint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women want to be able to want what they want, but -- and this is important, 
Bob -- they don't want to have to want it if they don't want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob, who thought he had a handle on what women wanted, is still bewildered. 
"What about being assertive in a man's world, being a superwoman?" he asks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jinx Mandell shakes her head compassionately. "I'm sorry, Bob. Those were the 
old rules." 
</P>
<P>
 "What Do Women Want?" is a game-show parody from ABC's new summer series "She 
TV." And Bobs everywhere take note: This new female-slanted comedy hour is out 
to break a few of the old rules itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "She TV," which begins a six-week outing Tuesday in the "NYPD Blue" time slot, 
was conceived by Caryn Mandabach, president of the Carsey-Werner Co. ("Grace 
Under Fire," "Roseanne" and "The Cosby Show"). It is sketch comedy in the 
tradition of "Saturday Night Live" and "In Living Color," but the distinction 
here is that the cast is predominantly female. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we look at the TV landscape, we look around at what's not there," says 
Mandabach. "It was pretty obvious to me that there were a lot of funny women 
out there who weren't being used. They just weren't getting the good, juicy 
comedy things to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Mandabach brought together former "Saturday Night Live" writers Bonnie and 
Terry Turner and "Laugh-In" creator George Schlatter to executive produce. The 
venture floundered and died at Fox, but when ABC took an interest the project 
revived. 
</P>
<P>
 "We originally saw this as a theater presentation last December," says Alan 
Sternfeld, ABC senior vice president of program planning and scheduling. "It 
frankly knocked our socks off." 
</P>
<P>
 The cast of "She TV," five women and three men, is largely unknown. Many of 
them come from ensemble comedy groups such as the Groundlings and Second City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at a lot of people," says Schlatter. "We were looking for magic. 
You don't go out and look for Goldie Hawn. Goldie Hawn comes in and you just 
know it when you see it." 
</P>
<P>
 "What we found, the more we searched, was that there were women out there 
whose spin (on things) was really, really, smart," says executive producer 
Bonnie Turner. "We found five women who are incredibly interesting, really fun, 
and bring really unique voices to the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Wallem, both a performer and a staff writer on the show, says "She TV" 
is like a dream come true. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had to act like the guys we used to work for," says Wallem. "When we'd 
be at a pitch table, the guys would pretty much run it and you'd have to join 
the boys club and ya-da ya-da and now and then get a joke in there. Now all of 
a sudden with this female show, the roles are reversed." 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Bakay, also a writer and performer, agrees that sketch comedy has long 
been male-dominated. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just a certain kind of humor you associate with those kind of boys' 
club writing staffs that is most of what you see," says Bakay. 
</P>
<P>
 But what distinguishes a female comedic sensibility? Linda Wallem says it's 
style. "Women tend not to be so wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am in their comedy 
approach. It's tennis as opposed to football. It's more of a reveal and a 
discovery rather than a male boom-boom-boom kind of thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The Turners emphasize, however, that "She TV" is hard comedy. It's got "an 
attitude and a bit of an edge," says Terry. 
</P>
<P>
 Bakay agrees. "My fears coming in were that female comedy's going to be soft 
... but I've been really pleased that some of the wilder, more aggressive stuff 
has been green-lighted enthusiastically." 
</P>
<P>
 The show's producers say "She TV" is not a feminist show nor even a political 
show. And while the comedy comes from a woman's point of view, they don't 
suggest that it reflects every woman's point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't promise that everything in this show is going to be the definitive 
statement on women in the '90s because there is no definitive statement," says 
Schlatter. 
</P>
<P>
 While the show's obvious appeal is to women, the show's producers hope men 
will tune in too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think for years women have sat in their living rooms or in theaters and 
laughed at male comedy and I don't know why men wouldn't be able to do the same 
thing," says Bonnie Turner. "We're not talking about bridal showers and PMS. 
We're talking about life." 
</P>
<P>
 "She TV" airs Tuesdays at 10 p.m. on ABC for six weeks.

RETRO; CABLE BOWS TO THE KING; FAMILY CHANNEL, TBS AND TNT ROLL OUT ELVIS FILMS 
FOR 17TH ANNIVERSARY OF HIS DEATH

 Elvis Presley fans, get out your blue suede shoes! Get ready to do the 
jailhouse rock and follow your dream. Practice curling your lips and swiveling 
your hips. And, by all means, don't forget to set your VCRs. 
</P>
<P>
 In commemoration Tuesday of the 17th anniversary of the rock legend's death at 
age 42, TBS, TNT and the Family Channel this week are offering a chunk of the 
King's movies. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, the Family Channel presents three Presley flicks from the '60s. At 
noon is one of his lesser-known musical comedies, 1967's "Easy Come, Easy Go." 
In this lightweight concoction, Presley plays a Navy underwater demolitions 
expert who discovers sunken treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 Next up at 2 p.m. is 1962's "Follow That Dream," which features the hit title 
tune. In this drama, Presley and his family decide to homestead a piece of land 
along a busy Florida highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kid Galahad" follows at 4 p.m. Based on the famous '30s boxing drama of the 
same name, Presley plays an ex-GI with a killer punch who refuses to throw a 
championship fight. Gig Young and Charles Bronson also star in this 
hard-hitting drama. 
</P>
<P>
 TNT presents 12 hours of Presley fare on Sunday. The day begins at 7 a.m. with 
the six-hour acclaimed 1990 ABC series "Elvis: The Early Years," starring 
Michael St. Gerard as the young Elvis. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Presley's best movies, 1957's "Jailhouse Rock," airs Sunday at 1 p.m. 
In this musical drama, Presley plays a former prisoner who becomes an overnight 
musical success. Songs include "Jailhouse Rock," "Treat Me Nice" and "Baby I 
Don't Care." 
</P>
<P>
 Following at 3:05 p.m. is another popular Presley flick, 1964's "Viva Las 
Vegas." Presley plays a race-car driver who takes a job as a waiter at a Vegas 
hotel, where he falls for swim instructor Ann-Margret. Songs include the title 
tune and "C'mon Everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 At 5 p.m. is the ill-fated 1969 Western "Charro!" Presley is miscast in this 
non-musical as a former gunman captured by his old gang and framed for a crime. 
</P>
<P>
 TNT's Presley tribute continues Monday at 5 p.m. with Part I of "Elvis: The 
Early Years." At 8 p.m. is the fluffy 1967 musical-comedy "Clambake," in which

in a bit part. 
</P>

the hit tune "Bossa Nova Baby." 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:05 p.m. is 1966's "Paradise, Hawaiian Style," in which Presley runs a 
charter plane service in Hawaii and still manages to find time for romance. 
</P>
<P>
 Presley sings the title tune as well as "Can't Help Falling In Love' in 1961's 
"Blue Hawaii," which airs at 9:05 p.m. Presley plays a former soldier who 
returns to his Hawaiian home and decides, against his mother's (Angela 
Lansbury) wishes, to work at a travel agency. 
</P>
<P>
 TBS concludes the evening at 11:05 p.m. with 1962's "Girls! Girls! Girls!" in 
which Presley is pursued by women, women, women. Stella Stevens plays one of

<P>
 I had just gotten off the phone with Madonna, having explained to her "I love 
my wife and child and would never do anything to hurt them," when I noticed 
Patrick Goldstein's "Hollywood's Real True Lies" (July 31). 
</P>
<P>
 The world as I know it was shattered.Call me naive (my friend David Letterman 
calls me "an innocent," Sylvester prefers "gullible"), but I had never realized 
after spending seven years in L.A. as a writer/producer/actor that there were 
dishonest people in show business. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh sure, there have been moments with various producers, agents, directors, 
writers, actresses, publicists, but they all had excellent reasons why they've 
been out to lunch every time I've called. So why, I ask, would anyone in this 
town try to inflate their standings by misleading fellow "professionals"? I 
asked Francis Ford (we're working on a deal) what I should do. He suggested 
writing to The Times. But why would a hard-working, diaper-changin, new father 
take the time to write a letter except to achieve the type of nefarious, 
moment-in-the-sun artificial hype that so bothered him in the first place? 
</P>
<P>
 Having no answer, I brushed my teeth, put on my sunglasses and wrote these 
words.

 An old story that's apropos to Patrick Goldstein's story on Hollywoodland: 
</P>
<P>
 There were two Indian tribes living in Hollywood during the 14th Century. They 
were the Blackfoot and the Whitefoot. The Blackfoot always lied and the 
Whitefoot always told the truth. One day, an Indian came walking down Dung 
Street, which is now Hollywood Boulevard. And a man asked: "What tribe are you 
with?" And the Indian answered, "The Whitefoot."

<P>
 Regarding Jane Hall's "The PrimeTime of Ms. Diane Sawyer" (Aug. 7), the 
question is posed: "Does Diane Sawyer deserve her $7-million contract with ABC 
News?" The answer is yes, and no.Yes, because anyone who can manage to extract 
such a ridiculously huge sum from the coffers of the lunatics who run ABC 
obviously deserves it. And no, because Sawyer is no more talented than 
thousands of other broadcasters doing the same thing every day without the 
media hype/fanfare provided by ABC promotion. And she admits this in the 
article. I hope this answers your question!

SCRIPTS, DOCTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "It's All in the Stars" by Richard Natale (Aug. 7) was much more revealing in 
what was not said than in what was. Nowhere in this lengthy analysis of how big 
stars can make big flops does anyone mention the single most important factor: 
bad scripts. 
</P>
<P>
 It's telling that none of the Hollywood wise men quoted even suggest there may 
be a connection between box-office performance and the quality of a script. Too 
many executives understand too little about what makes a script work or not, 
and they pay dearly for that ignorance, year after year. It's easy to be 
blinded by fabulous concepts ("Bruce Willis as Hudson Hawk!" "Eddie Murphy in 
'Beverly Hills Cop III'!") but think of the money and embarrassment that 
could've been saved had someone sat down and read these scripts before shooting 
and said, "Hey, wait a minute. This stinks." 
</P>
<P>
 When some star-driven piece of dreck goes belly-up at the box office, top 
execs always have very sophisticated explanations: the release date, the 
competition, the ad campaign, the mood of the country. But the lesson is much 
more simple. Put a big star with a bad script and what do you get? Surprise. A 
big star in a bad movie.

 Regarding why movie stars are so obviously overpaid when they only 
sporadically pay any decent return on the investment in them, I point to what 
William Goldman said in his book, "Adventures in the Screen Trade." 
</P>
<P>
 "Stars are essentially meaningless. Studio executives know this -- they know 
that the picture is the star. . . . They absolutely, positively, one hundred 
percent in their heart of hearts, in the dark nights of their souls, they know 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just don't believe it, that's all."

NEW CARS, HORROR STORIES AND REFRIGERATORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to let you (car dealers) know that your full-page ad -- your 
letter of "outrage" about The Times article on "Car-Buying Traps" -- is an 
outrageous insult to the intelligent car-buying public. I also must tell you 
that the ad got a great laugh when I read it aloud in my office this morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The laugh was a communal laugh of recognition. Your basic assertion, that car 
dealers "are in the business to serve the needs of the customer," is absurd 
based on our common experiences. Most people would rather have root canal 
surgery than have to take the hard sell and complex negotiating tricks they 
know they are going to face at a car dealership. 
</P>
<P>
 Your letter seemingly reflects a grand state of denial or a rationalization of 
a crummy way of doing business. You say you "strenuously object to The Times 
writer's comment that 'not knowing the dealer's price' presents a trap for the 
buyer." 
</P>
<P>
 And you object that car dealers are held to a higher standard than companies 
like Sears in the sale of refrigerators, or American Airlines in the sale of 
airline tickets. This so obviously avoids the point: We don't, we can't, 
negotiate (in most cases) for refrigerators or airline tickets! If we could, 
we'd want to know, or be able to estimate, the seller's real cost. 
</P>
<P>
 If the "vast majority of car buyers are very sophisticated," as you state, why 
are they flocking to Saturn's non-negotiable price policy? The Saturn dealers I 
spoke to are the first to tell you: Their car is not radically different; yet 
people buy them because it is a less-threatening (dare I use the word 
pleasant?) car-buying experience. 
</P>
<P>
 I am one of the "sophisticated buyers" you refer to. And yet I'm sick to death 
of new-car buying. By and large, the sales managers I run into are seemingly 
looking to "trap" and "snooker" me. 
</P>
<P>
 The traps are out there. The negative tenor of car salespeople is out there, 
and you know it. If you don't know, go out to the dealerships -- not as 
president of the California Motor Car Dealers Assn. -- but as a regular guy. I 
will be shocked if you still assert that articles like Ms. Kristof's are 
offensive or unnecessary.

<P>
 Apparently Ron Frieberg, president of the California Motor Car Dealers Assn., 
has not gone shopping for refrigerators lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Refrigerator salesmen do not take offers from potential buyers and respond 
with such classic lines as: "I really want to make this deal with you, but I'm 
not sure my manager is going to go for this. I mean, we've had a lot of people 
in looking at this fridge and it really could go at any minute. But let me take 
this offer back and we'll see if we can work something out." 
</P>
<P>
 Today's car buyers do not really care what a dealer's profit is on a car. We 
only care about the dealer's cost because your industry (with rare exceptions) 
insists on turning an automobile purchase into a day at the thrift shop. If 
dealerships continue to force buyers into negotiating over the price of a car, 
then buyers must by necessity know the dealer's cost.  
</P>
<P>
 If you were more concerned about fairness, rather than playing games with your 
customers, I am sure you could easily come up with a reasonable price for a car 
that would enable you to cover your "overhead" and still make a nice profit. 
This would contrast with the price at which you now list your cars, prices only 
truly uninformed people actually pay. 
</P>
<P>
 If Sears can quote one price on its refrigerators, why can't car dealers? If 
you were to charge a set price, no one would be able to claim that you were 
attempting to "trap" or "snooker" buyers again.

TRAVEL INSIDER: CHEAPER AIR FARES PRESENT MORE CONFUSION IN CHOICES; 
ADVERTISING: CONSUMERS WILL NEED TO READ ADS WARILY AS MORE AIRLINES COMPETE ON 
SHUTTLE FLIGHTS, ESPECIALLY IN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's always been wise for travelers to read airline ads warily. But with at 
least two of the largest carriers emulating the low-cost strategy of smaller 
Southwest Airlines, the strange world of competitive air fares is getting more 
complicated than ever before. Those who read ads carefully and have a general 
sense of the marketplace could save hundreds of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are a few things to keep in mind: 
</P>
<P>
 When United follows Southwest's lead, competition will be fierce and prices 
will fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttle by United, as United's new no-frills service will be known, starts 
Oct. 1 with 184 flights daily among eight cities, including LAX-San Francisco 
and LAX-Oakland routes, plus others from Burbank and Ontario. United plans to 
increase frequency of those flights over the following two months and add an 
LAX-Las Vegas route (in November) and an LAX-Phoenix route (in December). It 
appears that nine United shuttle routes on the West Coast will compete directly 
with existing Southwest flights. 
</P>
<P>
 The United shuttles will cost the airline less by flying often (at least five 
round-trips daily on each route) and using only 737 aircraft (as does 
Southwest), with seats assigned on the day of the flight. There will be no meal 
service, though there will be a first-class section. And United will try a new 
boarding procedure: holders of window seats first, then middle seats, then 
aisle seats. United officials also pledge stricter enforcement of carry-on 
luggage limits. 
</P>
<P>
 For United shuttle flights out of LAX, round-trip tickets for coach seats 
purchased at the last minute (also called walk-up fares, these are the 
highest-priced tickets) are tentatively set at $124 for LAX-Las Vegas and $178 
for LAX-San Francisco. (As on Southwest, restricted, advance-purchase tickets 
will be available for less.) 
</P>
<P>
 Southwest, well-known for its low prices, its first-come, first-served 
seating, its lack of meal service, its all-coach seating and its profitability, 
has pledged to fight back, probably with new long-haul service in direct 
competition with existing United routes. Meanwhile, Southwest is maintaining 
its extensive and affordable California service. Round-trip walk-up fares for 
LAX-Las Vegas run $124; Los Angeles-Oakland, $138. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental is offering new Southern California no-frills flights too. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental started its Continental Lite service last October and now flies to 
dozens of cities under that name (the vast majority in Texas or east of the 
Mississippi). It also offers discounted "peanuts" fares to and from several 
more cities, including L.A. Unlike United, Continental has avoided direct 
competition with Southwest in most cases, instead targeting many eastern routes 
served by USAir. 
</P>
<P>
 Continental Lite tickets are unrestricted and don't include meal service but 
do feature assigned seats. On some, but not all, routes Continental Lite makes 
deeper discounts available to passengers who are willing to buy tickets with 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fares on all Continental Lite flights are known as "peanuts" fares, but there 
are also flights under the traditional Continental name that also offer 
"peanuts" prices. Since March, the carrier has been offering round-trip 
"peanuts" fares from Los Angeles to San Antonio ($388-$398 for walk-ups), Omaha 
($398) and Denver (generally $398, but service there will be discontinued Oct. 
31). Under an "Add a Penny, Add a Pal" program, some "peanuts" travelers can 
add one cent to their fare and bring an adult companion. (Other airlines have 
similar offers.) 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these new customer-conscious programs, many old rules for consumers 
still apply. For instance: Just because you see a price in an airline 
advertisement, that doesn't mean you can buy anything for that figure. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a tradition now. When a fare war is declared, the major airlines take 
out full-page newspaper ads such as the ones American took out across the 
nation on July 26: For a New York-LAX flight, the larger type said, the 
discounted price was "$194." But the smaller type above said: "Fares are each 
way based on round-trip purchase." In other words, the product being sold in 
the ad cost $388, not $194, and there were no one-way tickets available for 
$194. (The offer expired Aug. 2.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't think it's misleading," says American spokeswoman Teresa Hanson. "I 
think people are used to that now," says Joe Hopkins of United Airlines. 
Certainly some are: Bill Mosley, spokesman for the U.S. Department of 
Transportation, says that "we would not consider that deceptive so long as the 
ad made it clear that (the fare) was only available for a round-trip." 
</P>
<P>
 Another old rule: On a heavily promoted discount, airlines limit the number of 
cheap seats available, sometimes severely. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last year, the Department of Transportation fined Continental Airlines 
$20,000 and USAir $5,000 and warned them against future "deceptive advertising 
practices." In the Continental case, federal officials alleged that the airline 
advertised discount fares between Newark and Europe, but "failed to make a 
reasonable number of seats available at those fares." In the USAir case, 
federal officials found that the carrier had continued to run a recurring 
advertisement for a discounted new service between New York's La Guardia 
Airport and Sarasota, Fla., despite the fact that by the time the last ad ran, 
only one discounted seat remained.

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; NEW POSSIBILITIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Last week's opening of the border crossing between Aqaba, Jordan, and Eilat, 
Israel, opens up new possibilities for American tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Eilat, Israel's most southerly port and the country's only access to the Red 
Sea, has long been a winter resort destination for Europeans attracted by its 
temperate climates and clear waters. Jordan's Aqaba, just across the Gulf of 
Aqaba, is much less developed, although King Hussein's vacation palace is 
there, and private sources are "eager to get on with" the development of 
tourism facilities, said Rania Atalla, director of the Jordan Information 
Bureau in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 One tour operator opined that Jordan is not a country in which many travelers 
would want to spend more than three or four days, but it is home to some 
extraordinary sights -- the ruins at Petra being among the most famous. It 
takes from three to five hours to drive to Petra from Amman depending on the 
route, but the ancient city is only an hour's drive from Aqaba. 
</P>
<P>
 What Israeli tourism sources were promoting last week was the new possibility 
of being able to fly into Israel, visit various holy sites, then going on to 
Eilat and using it as a base to venture into Jordan or into neighboring Egypt. 
There is already enthusiastic talk of joint marketing efforts and combined 
package tours and many reminders that the diving in the Red Sea is among the 
best in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Travelers making the trip any time soon should pack light because they will 
have to walk the roughly quarter-mile crossing between the Aqaba and Eilat 
checkpoints -- cars registered in Israel and Jordan are not allowed across the 
border. Rental cars are available in both cities. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, day trips will not be allowed; visitors must spend at least one 
night once they have crossed the border. Aqaba has several hotels and 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 The crossing is open from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sunday through Thursday.

WEEKEND ESCAPE: DEL MAR; RACING FORUM; AND THEY'RE OFF . . . FOR THE SUMMER 
RACING SEASON AT THE RECENTLY REBUILT BEACHSIDE TRACK WITH THE FAMOUS HOLLYWOOD 
PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ahead lies a seemingly endless chain of pulsing brake lights as we crawl 
through heavy Friday evening traffic on the San Diego Freeway. I tap my fingers 
on the wheel and fiddle with the radio to cloak the growls of my empty stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife, Mary Lou, is oblivious. She is transfixed by an already dogeared copy 
of Saturday's Daily Racing Form. Under the soft glow of the overhead light, she 
is immersed in such weighty issues as whether Rapen Boy can run as well on dirt 
as he does on grass and if Tossofthecoin can go the distance. 
</P>
<P>
 This is serious stuff for track hounds. We are headed to Del Mar, about 20 
miles north of San Diego, where, for about seven glorious weeks through Sept. 
14, some of the nation's best racing takes place at a newly refurbished track 
that is steeped in Hollywood history. 
</P>
<P>
 Our drive took about two hours from our home in Long Beach, and we arrived 
close to 10 p.m. at the Stratford Inn, a 108-room hotel (large motel, really) 
on Camino Del Mar. We chose it because it's close to the racetrack, we were 
able to book a room only a week ahead, and we got a rate of $85 a night, a 
relative bargain (rooms are often booked on racing weekends). We were also 
pleased to learn at the front desk that the hotel offers a shuttle service to 
and from the track. We signed up immediately, suspecting -- correctly, it turns 
out -- that an invasion by 50,000 or so gamblers a day would snarl traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 We dropped our bags in our room and went searching for a late supper, ending 
up at the Cafe Del Mar, a California cuisine kind of place. The aroma of a 
tasty but pungent baked garlic appetizer we ordered announced our presence to 
all the other diners on the patio. From there it was then straight to bed, 
because Saturday's schedule started early. Mary Lou, the more serious racing 
fan of the two of us, wanted to catch the horses going through their morning 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 I must admit that at first I wasn't crazy about the idea of rising at daybreak 
to watch a bunch of horses trot around, only to return and see the real thing 
that afternoon. But it was well worth it. The thud of hoofs against damp earth 
broke the silence of a gray, misty morning. The sleek, muscled animals puffed 
like steam locomotives as they strained to slice another 10th of a second off 
their best times. 
</P>
<P>
 We hung out along the rail until 8 a.m., when the gates opened for a 
track-sponsored "Donuts Day." Twice during the meet (the next day is Aug. 27), 
the track offers fans free doughnuts and coffee along with the opportunity to 
ask questions of track announcer Trevor Denman, as well as a leading jockey, 
trainer and steward, as the racing judges are called. 
</P>
<P>
 The session was highly entertaining. Questions ranged from how jockeys can 
appeal misconduct suspensions, to the procedure for assigning numbers to horses 
for a race. One superstitious bettor asked jockey Gary Stevens what time he was 
born. (Answer: 6:20 a.m.) 
</P>
<P>
 Don't applaud, we were told, since it might disturb the horses. Everyone 
flailed their arms to show their appreciation instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, we headed back to the hotel for much-needed mid-morning naps. We 
later hopped aboard the hotel van for the track, arriving in plenty of time to 
plan our bets before the first post time of 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 General admission to the track is $3, and there are several seating options. 
The infield area and the less-desirable fringes of the grandstand are free. We 
chose grandstand seats almost directly above the finish line at $4 each. Our 
seats were on Level 5, the top floor, and pillars supporting the roof partially 
obstructed the view. Level 2 or 3 would have been better. (Seat tickets are 
available by mail and at the track on most days.) 
</P>
<P>
 The next task was to sample track food, which at Del Mar is something of a 
scavenger hunt. Snack bars and bars are scattered throughout the track, and 
there are a couple of sit-down restaurants in the clubhouse area. 
</P>
<P>
 We started by splitting a rather skimpy corned beef sandwich from the Trifecta 
Carver on the third level, and later had fish tacos from Rubio's stand on the 
first level. To thoroughly mix cuisines, we then tried some excellent orange 
chicken cooked to order at a Chinese food stand on Level 2. After that eating 
extravaganza, we should have searched for antacids, but instead we turned our 
attention to the horses. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife and I have very different gambling styles. I am a conservative $2 
bettor looking for the sure thing. Mary Lou loves long shots and exotic wagers. 
Hence she doesn't win very often, but when she does, it's an event worth 
celebrating. 
</P>
<P>
 I gradually accumulated a profit of a couple of bucks while Mary Lou was down 
about $50. But on the last race, I took a flyer on a 25-to-1 horse, Bold 
Capital, that won, so we broke even for the day when racing wrapped up around 
6:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 On the recommendation of a track security guard, we headed for dinner at 
Bully's North. One of the better-known track hangouts, Bully's is a dimly lit 
refuge of tufted red leather upholstery and pillow-sized slabs of beef that 
seemed out of place in health-conscious, trendy Del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering through a heavy wood door carved with a jockey and a horse, we were 
told that Bully's doesn't take reservations and the wait would be more than an 
hour. We took a place at the bar and sipped vodka martinis, which seemed to 
make the time pass considerably faster. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost everybody was having the prime rib, so we did too. We chose the prime 
rib dinner for two, a two-inch-thick full cut that was more than enough. It was 
the best prime rib either of us could recall, and we waddled out of the 
restaurant, saying we couldn't possibly eat again for days. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, we nursed ourselves through the previous night's assault of 
fat and booze by picking up coffee and muffins from the hotel's complimentary 
continental breakfast, served in the Paddock Room. 
</P>
<P>
 Then we were off for a long walk down the main beach, about a half-mile north 
of the hotel. The sunny beachfront was alive with surfers, Boogie boarders, 
children building sandcastles and strolling couples. 
</P>
<P>
 We caught a quick lunch at the Baja Grill in the village, where the mango 
margaritas had just the right amount of sweetness. I had a bowl of tortilla 
soup loaded with pieces of shellfish, but Mary Lou complained that there wasn't 
enough grilled mahi-mahi in her tacos. We finished just in time to make the 
long walk to the track for the start of Sunday's racing. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, we sat in the so-called clubhouse actually, just the other end of 
the grandstand -- for $2 more apiece. The only real difference appeared to be 
the linoleum flooring, instead of bare concrete, and a less-enthusiastic crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The atmosphere was too sedate, my wife decided. When the ponies turn for home, 
true racing fans are on their feet, screaming for their horses. There were far 
too many people who stayed seated in the clubhouse, she complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Our luck turned cold. I spent less time betting and more time admiring the 
splendor of the setting. It was a chance to look over what is arguably 
California's most beautiful track. The grandstand, first built by Bing Crosby 
and Pat O'Brien in 1937, was razed to make way last year for an $80-million 
wonder of concrete and steel. Yet the Spanish Mission-style charm of the 
building was retained, along with lush landscaping and ocean views. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, it's more a magnet for San Diego's business and society elite than for 
Hollywood's A List. But reminders of its celebrity-rich past abound, from 
historical photos lining the walls to the recording of crooner Crosby's "Where 
the Turf Meets the Surf" played daily over the loudspeaker before the first 
race. 
</P>
<P>
 It had come time for us to go. Mary Lou sunk the last of her betting money 
into a track sweat shirt and we were off . . . back to the crowded freeway. 
</P>

HIKING: RICHARDSON GROVE; HUGGED A REDWOOD LATELY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can't miss viewing the redwoods in Richardson Grove State Park; the 
highway lobby had California 101 built right through the heart of the park. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you really want to experience the magic and majesty of "The Grove," you 
must get off the highway and hit the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson Grove has some fine footpaths that visit quiet redwood groves and 
Eel River beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 The park, acquired in the 1920s, is named for California's 25th governor, 
Friend William Richardson, though it's any park lover's guess why; the 
ultra-conservative Richardson was completely unsympathetic to the state park 
system, then in its infancy, and vetoed all expenditure bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Start your visit to Richardson Grove with a look at the natural history 
exhibits and history displays at the visitor center. Check out the arboreal 
curiosities: a walk-through tree, and a dawn redwood, the coastal redwood's 
Chinese cousin, located in the group camp. The park features a full schedule of 
interpretive programs during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 This loop trip offers an enjoyable jaunt above the South Fork of the Eel 
River. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From California 101, eight miles south of 
Garberville, take the Richardson Grove State Park exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside the park, getting to either of the trail heads is a bit tricky, 
unless you happened to have reserved a site in Madrone Campground. If you're 
not camping, the best bet is to park at the picnic ground near the visitor 
center, follow the short path to the California 101 underpass, emerge on the 
other side and pick up the path leading to and through Madrone Campground. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: From the signed trail head in Madrone Campground, begin your climb 
to Lookout Point Trail, which almost immediately forks. Stay left and begin 
ascending thorough redwoods and Douglas fir to Lookout Point. The so-so vista 
is of the Eel River Canyon and California 101. 
</P>
<P>
 From the lookout, the path steepens. You briefly join the trail to Hartsook 
Inn before meeting up with Tan Oak Springs Trail and switchbacking up a 
forested ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 After cresting the ridge, about 1 1/2 miles from the trail head, the path 
descends a short distance to Tan Oak Springs. The cattail -- and tule -- 
surrounding the spring isn't much to behold, but it's a nice place to take a 
breather. 
</P>
<P>
 Past the spring, the trail continues descending to the south bank of Durphy 
Creek, then levels off to follow the creek eastward. The trail ends at the park 
road, where you'll turn left to return. Lookout Point, Tan Oak Springs, Durphy 
Creek Trails 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Richardson Grove State Park, Northern California redwoods. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 4 miles round trip. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: Cool, shady redwood groves. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Redwoods, tranquil Durphy Creek. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Moderate. 
</P>
<P>
 PRECAUTIONS: High-altitude hiking and short visitor season (mid-to late 
summer). 
</P>
<P>
 FOR MORE INFORMATION: Richardson Grove State Park, 1600 U.S. Highway 101, 8,

THE HEALTHY TRAVELER: MAKING THE BEST OF UNWIND TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Americans are taking vacations more frequently but trips are getting shorter. 
The question is, then, is it possible to unwind in only a few days and are 
there tricks for making it happen fast? 
</P>
<P>
 This year, Americans on vacation will average fewer than five nights away, 
compared to more than six nights a decade ago, according to figures compiled by 
the federal government's U.S. Travel Data Center. 
</P>
<P>
 During these briefer stays, vacationers must shift from work to leisure mode 
more quickly, if they hope to reap the vacation benefits of rest and 
rejuvenation. 
</P>
<P>
 Easier said than done, according to Dr. Mark Goulston, a Santa Monica 
psychiatrist who often hears his clients embarking on three- or four-day trips 
fret: "That's not enough time to unwind." 
</P>
<P>
 "A week off is ideal," said Dr. Ray Sahelian, a Marina del Rey family practice 
physician and former travel medicine specialist. "The first three or four days 
most people are still unwinding." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as Sahelian and others acknowledge, three or four days away may be the 
most we can manage. When that's the case, vacationers should make a conscious 
effort to shift into a more relaxed frame of mind even before departure, 
experts said. That means making trip preparations in an organized, unhurried 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Start collecting things to take along in a single place at home, said Sheila 
Cluff, owner of spas in Ojai and Palm Springs and a frequent traveler. Doing 
this gradually can help reduce last-minute stress. Getting sufficient rest 
before leaving can help too, although Cluff admits this isn't always easy to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 Many vacationers wrestle with several conflicts before their departure date, 
making them feel even more stressed, said Goulston, who heads the Direct 
Conflict Resolution Group, a company that helps businesses resolve inner-office 
conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 There's often guilt. People tell Goulston they feel torn about vacation plans, 
thinking they should really stay home and spend the money fixing up their 
house, buying a new sofa or paying bills. 
</P>
<P>
 If finances are tight, they might be right, Goulston said. But often it is 
just a case of people not treating themselves well. "A part of them thinks they 
don't deserve a vacation," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Focus on the permanent value of vacation, Goulston tells them. Yes, the meals 
and the good times will be temporary, but the memories will be long-lasting. 
And time spent with family or friends can bolster relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "No dying man ever wished he'd spent more money on couches," he tells clients.

<P>
 While en route, continue to focus on unwinding, experts said, using a 
whatever-works approach. Cliff, for example, takes along brochures describing 
the destination and reads them cover-to-cover on the plane, getting more 
excited about the trip with each succeeding page. 
</P>
<P>
 Sahelian likes books written by authors from the area he is about to visit. He 
read the novel "Rebecca" before a visit to Cornwall. He also studies the 
history of his destination, which makes sightseeing and tours more enjoyable. 
"But I don't look at a lot of pictures of the destination, I just read text. 
That way I don't have a preconceived notion of what a place will look like." 
</P>
<P>
 Other seasoned travelers have become adept at shifting into vacation mode 
through differing measures. When traveling with his family, Los Angeles 
publicist Michael Saltzman tries to book accommodations that don't have 
telephone or television. Terry Wills, president of a Hermosa Beach marketing 
communications company and the mother of two young boys, tries to book a hotel 
with a fitness facility so that she can enjoy exercising -- something she finds 
difficult to fit in as often as she would like at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at the destination, some vacationers wrestle with yet another conflict: 
how to shift from the adrenaline-driven style typical at work to the relaxation 
mode that makes for a rejuvenating vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 To help encourage the downshift, Cluff and Goulston both recommend engaging in 
intense physical activity as soon as you arrive at your destination, even if 
it's just a self-guided walking tour. With the exhaustion that follows, 
relaxation is inevitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain personality types have an easier time shifting into a leisure frame of 
mind, said Dr. Seppo Iso-Ahola, professor of social psychology at the 
University of Maryland, College Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who have learned to value leisure as an important part of life unwind 
quickly, he said, while workaholic types may find relaxation more difficult. 
Those who have the easiest time unwinding on vacation, in Iso-Ahola's 
experience, are travelers who are as passionate about an avocation as their 
work. It's also easier to slip into a vacation frame of mind if you leave 
familiar surroundings, he added, so at-home vacations might be difficult for 
many people.

 ST. PETERSBURG by Steve Raymer (Turner Publishing, Inc., $39.95 hardcover).  
</P>
<P>
 In many nations of the world, there are two key cities -- one gritty, 
businesslike, exciting in a frisson- producing sort of way, the other softer, 
more artistic, and often simultaneously more sensual and more spiritual. New 
York, Johannesburg, Sydney, Milan and Madrid are examples of the first sort; 
Los Angeles, Capetown, Melbourne, Rome and Barcelona are examples of the 
second. And in Russia, of course, the two are Moscow and St. Petersburg, 
respectively. St. Petersburg (the former Leningrad, and before that Petrograd, 
and before that, well, St. Petersburg) isn't tough, gray Moscow. Instead, it is 
a city of canals, or formal gardens, of gloriously ornate palaces and 
pastel-tinted houses. Stalin hated the city. Tchaikovsky, who graduated from 
the city's famed music conservatory, loved it. Steve Raymer -- former Soviet 
Union specialist for National Geographic and now director of the National 
Geographic Society News Service -- loves it, too. His portrait of the place, in 
words and photos, is understated, and not uncritical, but he deftly 
communicates his affection for the city and makes it come alive.

Greg Edwards (Mustang Publishing, $8.95 paper).  
</P>
<P>
 There's no such thing as a free dejeuner, but there are plenty of free 
museums, public monuments, holidays, fairs and festivals, factory tours, sports 
facilities, beaches, hiking trails, vista points and the like -- all over the 
world. Mustang's "For Free" volumes, each offering "hundreds of free things to 
do" ("free and inexpensive," in the case of Paris) within its subject area, are 
concise and surprisingly comprehensive guides to such institutions, events and 
places. 
</P>
<P>
 The London and Washington, D.C., books use helpful letter symbols after each 
listing, indicating proximity to public transportation, suitability for 
children, availability of facilities for the handicapped, etc. The Paris volume 
gives transportation information, but doesn't mention children or the 
handicapped. (Mark Beffart, author of the Paris guide, incidentally, defines 
"extremely cheap" as 18 francs or less for museums and historic sites, nine 
francs or less for private gardens. Figure approximately five francs to the 
dollar.)

 WHITEWATER RAFTING IN NORTH AMERICA by Lloyd Armstead (Globe Pequot Press, 
$16.95 paper) and WESTERN WHITEWATER; FROM THE ROCKIES TO THE PACIFIC by Jim 
Cassidy, Bill Cross and Fryar Calhoun (North Fork Press, $34.95 paper). Nothing 
to do with the Clintons here -- just a couple of serious guidebooks for the 
rafting/canoeing/kayaking crowd. Lloyd Armstead's volume is a straightforward 
facts-and-figures guide to 200 rafting trips in the United States, Canada, 
Mexico and Costa Rica. "Western Whitewater" -- at 590 pages, one of the longest 
and heaviest paperbacks I've ever hefted -- covers a much smaller area in much 
greater detail, with photographs and anecdotal asides included. 
</P>
<P>
 CALIFORNIA UNDER SAIL; A GUIDE TO BEACHES, BOAT TRIPS, MARITIME MUSEUMS, 
ISLANDS, & COASTAL ADVENTURES by Else Ditmars (Country Roads Press, $9.95 
paper). If it's in the Golden State and has to do with the Pacific Ocean, it's 
probably listed here -- without much detail, but in accessible style.

DESTINATION: CANADA; GREEN GABLES AND LOBSTER DINNERS; PRINCE EDWARD ISLAND IS 
THE PLACE TO GORGE ON SHELLFISH, 'ANNE' MANIA . . . AND PEACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Prince Edward Island, in the Canadian Maritimes, is one of those rare travel 
destinations that lives up to its own press, perhaps because that press is so 
understated. The travel brochures describe a small, lovely, peaceful island of 
red soil, rolling green hills, friendly people and expansive beaches. On two 
separate trips -- the most recent a camping vacation last summer with two other 
adults and five children -- that's exactly what we found. 
</P>
<P>
 Located just north of the provinces of New Brunswick and Nova Scotia, Prince 
Edward Island -- or P.E.I. -- is a 140-mile-long crescent of farmland and 
beaches, with a year-round population of about 125,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although serviced by several airlines, most visitors reach the island by 
ferry: One runs from Cape Tormentine, New Brunswick, to Borden, P.E.I.; the 
other from Caribou, N.S., to Wood Islands, P.E.I. The ferry rides provide a 
kind of buffer, allowing the tourist to shake off the "there" of the mainland 
and prepare to embrace the "here" of island life. 
</P>
<P>
 Inhabited by the Mi'Kmaq (Micmac) people for thousands of years, Prince Edward 
Island was claimed as a European discovery in 1534, and settled in the early 
1700s by French-heritage Acadians, who named it Ile Saint-Jean. In 1758, the 
British occupied Prince Edward Island, deporting many of the Acadians. The 
following years brought Scottish and Irish settlers, and Loyalists fleeing the 
Colonies during the Revolutionary War. In 1864, P.E.I. claimed its title as the 
"Birthplace of Canada" by hosting the Conference on Maritime Union, during 
which the idea of confederation of provinces was first proposed. (It became a 
reality in 1867 and what is now P.E.I. joined in 1873.) 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest draw for visitors to P.E.I. is the town of Cavendish, which is in 
the middle of the crescent on the northern shore, in the greenest, lushest part 
of the island. It is home to the "Green Gables House" of the novel "Anne of 
Green Gables" fame. The specter of Anne -- invariably described as a "feisty 
little red-haired waif" -- haunts the island, and even a visitor with zero 
interest in Lucy Maud Montgomery's 1908 fictional heroine would be hard pressed 
to avoid her. Scores of motels, ice cream stands, miniature golf courses and 
restaurants bear names with some reference to Anne and her story. And tourists 
by the busload roll up for a walk through the Green Gables House -- the setting 
for the novel -- and to snap up such souvenirs as straw hats with little red 
braids attached. (Voila: Instant Anne!) 
</P>
<P>
 Maintained by the Canadian park service, a tour through Green Gables is free 
and not without its charms; my two daughters, then 6 and 3, were thrilled to 
spot Anne's broken slate and puffed-sleeve dress, and Marilla's brooch -- all 
featured in the novel -- as we toured the rooms. True Lucy Maud fans make 
pilgrimages not only to the Green Gables House but to other spots around the 
island, including Montgomery's birthplace, her home, the schoolhouses where she 
taught, the Anne of Green Gables Museum and the cemetery in which the author 
was buried in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Cavendish, however, even the most devoted Anne-o-phile should not 
ignore Prince Edward Island National Park, with its spectacular beaches, 
crashing surf and dramatic cliffs and dunes. 
</P>
<P>
 What we had not hoped for was fine cuisine, and we were not disappointed there 
either. It's quite possible that P.E.I. has a number of fine restaurants, but 
taking a low-budget vacation with children is not the way to sample them. We 
settled, instead, for campfire suppers of roasted island potatoes, grilled, 
farm-raised mussels and chowders of fresh local seafood. We bought vegetables 
from resident gardeners and fish from fishermen's boats. We ate cheaply and 
very, very well. Our one splurge was to indulge in a local tradition: the 
P.E.I. lobster supper. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobster suppers, which are held roughly from mid-May through mid-October, are 
offered in at least 10 locations; some sponsored by churches and nonprofit 
community organizations, and some by private enterprise. Judging by those we 
have attended, the dinners are no-frills affairs . . . a perfect showcase for 
unadorned, local seafood and for the friendly service that characterizes even 
the most touristy of attractions on the island. 
</P>
<P>
 As you are served at this family-style meal, you are more likely to rub elbows 
with someone diners from the States or mainland Canada than with a P.E.I. 
native. But the locals make up the kitchen and wait staff and seem happy to 
chat with visitors. And the suppers are a bargain: For about $20, one can gorge 
on chowders, lobster, salads and pies. Nonalcoholic beverages are included, and 
wine and beer are available for an additional cost in some locations. A P.E.I. 
lobster supper is also a great place to take the kids: No one frowns when an 
errant elbow tips over the milk glass, and waitresses nimbly sidestep crawling 
toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of all lobster suppers is the New Glasgow Lobster Supper in the 
town of New Glasgow, near the island's center. We went there several years ago, 
after a day spent hiking the cliffs of Cavendish and dodging waves in the 
crashing surf at the spectacular Cavendish National Park. The large, low-slung 
hall provided just the place to shake the red island soil from our shoes, and 
to slake appetites made ravenous by sun and salt air. 
</P>
<P>
 We dined on fish chowder, lobster (served hot or cold), homemade rolls, potato 
salad, coleslaw, pickles, cake and four kinds of homemade pies -- apple, 
cherry, raisin and lemon -- served with Elmer's ice cream, a local brand. Most 
of the suppers offer an alternative to lobster; ham, salmon, steak and scallops 
seem to be popular, and all offer reduced-price children's menus with hot dogs, 
hamburgers and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 New Glasgow is also home of the P.E.I. Preserve Co., where a 1914 buttery 
houses a restaurant, tearoom and gift shop selling local hams, mustards, honeys 
and vinegar. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during our first trip to P.E.I., when we rented a cabin near Alberton, 
on the western end of the island, that we hit many of the major attractions: 
Green Gables, Cavendish National Park, North Cape (the site of a wind 
generation installation and a great place to fly kites) the West Point 
Lighthouse (a hotel, restaurant and lighthouse museum). We also toured numerous 
small museums (the Potato Museum in O'Leary, the Seaport Museum in Victoria, 
the Acadian Museum in Miscouche). 
</P>
<P>
 We drove a lot during that visit, admiring the small, orderly houses with neat 
lines of laundry drying on the back-yard clotheslines, the dusty potato fields 
and the rolling pastures where cattle grazed at the ocean's edge. We gorged on 
local ice cream -- Elmer's and the rich and well-marketed Cow's brand, the Ben 
& Jerry's of P.E.I. (Their brochure features a photograph of a cow wearing an 
"instant Anne" hat with braids.) 
</P>
<P>
 We spent a delightful day in Victoria, a small village on the south shore with 
a turn-of-the-century feel, a chocolate factory and a number of craft shops and 
small restaurants. And we also briefly toured the capital city of 
Charlottetown. There, we purposely skipped the musical "Anne of Green Gables," 
which seems to enjoy an indefinite run at the Confederation Centre of the Arts, 
but I genuinely regret missing "Annekenstein," billed as "a satirical review of 
all things Anne," produced annually by the Off Stage Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 On a return trip last summer, however, we pitched our tents on the wind-swept 
peninsulas of the provincial parks on the eastern end of the island, north of 
Souris, and barely moved except to explore one spectacular beach after another. 
We collected beach glass and shells, and the children delighted at the sight of 
clams, crabs, periwinkles, blue herons and -- at one beach -- a fox. Our 
biggest sightseeing expedition was to the East Point lighthouse (nice view) and 
the Basin Head Fisheries Museum, which was hosting sack races and a mussel feed 
on the day we were there. 
</P>
<P>
 The beach at Basin Head is a vast expanse of "singing sand" that makes noise 
when you walk on it; it's more like squeaking, actually, and the sound is due, 
I'm told, to a high silica content. Walk past the small strip by the parking 
lot, and the beach is virtually deserted. Because of a combination of geography 
and the Gulf Stream, one can actually swim off P.E.I. without turning blue. But 
although the islanders like to brag about "warm" water, we found it a bit of a 
hyperbole. It's definitely warmer than, say, Maine, but still quite brisk. 
(Another note about camping on P.E.I.: During our trip in August we encountered 
no noisome insects, but friends who camped there earlier in the summer reported 
being tormented by mosquitoes.) 
</P>
<P>
 That second trip proved to be the most memorable, but that is perhaps because 
we are, as a family, more temperamentally suited to collecting seashells than 
driving from attraction to attraction. But both our trips revealed to us a 
quiet, lovely place, low on excitement but high on natural beauty and 
friendliness. GUIDEBOOK: P.E.I. Pleasures

TAKING THE KIDS: BUILDING IN SOME UNSTRUCTURED TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EILEEN OGINTZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the Wertliebs left for the quiet beach vacation they had planned on 
Martha's Vineyard, the computer issue had to be resolved once and for all. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a big decision whether or not to take my laptop," confessed Don 
Wertlieb, a Boston child psychologist and chairman of the Tufts University 
child studies department. To his wife's consternation, Wertlieb decided he 
needed it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I look forward to no faxes, but I get some anxiety about being out of touch," 
he explained. "For folks used to very structured lives, suddenly shifting gears 
to a lot of unstructured time can be very stressful." 
</P>
<P>
 That goes for kids, too. In fact, for kids used to having every minute 
scheduled by school and camp, swim practice and piano lessons, play dates, 
tutoring and Scouts, the prospect of several days without 50 cable channels can 
be as daunting as it is for parents who can't go an hour without checking their 
voice mail. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a panic attack about what you're going to do with the kids," joked 
Jill Hand, a working mother of three from Denver who is a big fan of 
let's-not-plan-much-of-anything trips. She remembers her displeasure at being 
dragged from museum to museum when she was a child. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way, you have to make a conscious effort to slow down," Hand said. "It 
takes a couple of days before the kids can get into it and figure out what to 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Their skills for using their free time are primitive," said Wertlieb, himself 
the father of three. "They just don't know how to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Younger children may have an even harder time because familiar routines are so 
important to their equilibrium. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, some families not used to spending much time together might find 
the long-anticipated stay at a cabin in the woods or a cottage on a quiet beach 
isn't nearly as relaxing as they expected. "It can become very tense," Wertlieb 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Small children don't enjoy relaxing. They want to be up and doing," said 
Chicago child psychologist Victoria Lavigne. "If you think you're going to 
spend a week reading under a beach umbrella, it's not going to happen. The best 
of all possible worlds is to have a sitter." 
</P>
<P>
 With young children, she suggests, it helps to plan activities for them -- a 
specific time at the pool, a walk in the woods -- and adhere as much as 
possible to their regular meal, nap and bedtime schedules. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember, too, that as much as parents and kids might want to spend time 
together, they won't want to spend every minute with the entire family. Grab 
the opportunity for some one-on-one time with each other, as well as with the 
kids. Go fishing with one child while the others play on the beach under your 
spouse's watchful eye. Head off on an adult hike while they play in the cabin 
next door and then offer to reciprocate for those parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Use the evenings to try some things there never seems time for at home: 
Monopoly games, a jigsaw puzzle, reading spooky stories aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill Hand, meanwhile, has taken the family vacation-without-much-planning idea 
to new lengths. "We're just going to get in the car and go," she said.

18-hole rounds of golf as the pros roam the course offering playing tips and 
suggestions. The package includes carts, green fees and practice range balls. 
The final day features the Club Med Amateur Open Tournament with prizes awarded 
by the pros. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Golf Week is scheduled for Nov. 5-12. The price for the one-week stay 
in Huatulco, not including golf benefits, is $650 per person, double occupancy, 
including all meals, unlimited wine and beer at lunch and dinner, evening 
entertainment, picnics, boat rides and use of tennis courts. A surcharge of 
$150 is levied for guests over age 55 who participate in the golf program.

BACKPACK & BUDGET; ALONE AND VULNERABLE IN BANGKOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousands of backpackers have interesting, exotic, trouble-free adventures in 
Southeast Asia each year. But last winter, Karl, 26, on the homeward leg of an 
around-the-world journey, almost wasn't one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Karl arrived in Bangkok after a trip through Europe, the Middle East and Asia. 
He found himself near Bangkok's infamous red-light district -- Patpong. 
Curiosity got the better of him, as it does with many Western travelers, and he 
decided to take a look at this area, which has earned itself a notorious 
reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 It was noon, a time when the streets are pretty much deserted, and Karl was 
alone. Barkers try to entice tourists to come in to see live sex shows. A 
barker invited him into one of the clubs. Karl declined at first but after an 
offer of a cold beer for 50 Bhat ($4) and the promise that there wasn't a cover 
charge, he changed his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Once inside, beer in hand and eyes adjusted to the light, he looked around and 
realized he was the only patron. He was uncomfortable, so he put 100 Bhat ($8) 
on the table and headed for the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Two bouncers blocked the exit. "The manager will bring the bill," one of them 
stated. 
</P>
<P>
 When the manager appeared, the bill he presented listed charges ranging from 
an entrance fee to entertainment. The total was 500 -- not Bhat, but dollars! 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing that there was no other safe way out, Karl reluctantly pulled out 
his wallet. The manager took it from him, fingered through the $200 cash inside 
and handed him back a few bills. 
</P>
<P>
 This upsetting situation could have been worse. They didn't check him for a 
money belt. He had been carrying $1,200. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson is this: Wherever you are, especially when you are on your own, 
don't allow yourself to be enticed into situations where you are vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 Always carry the bulk of your money in travelers checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Be informed so you can avoid potential problems and then try not to let the 
lousy actions of a few sour your view of a whole country. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, for budget travelers, current sources of information geared to 
guiding independent travelers through Thailand are available. Look for them in 
libraries and retail bookstores. 
</P>
<P>
 In October, 1992, Lonely Planet published a 623-page, fifth edition of its 
award-winning "Thailand: A Travel Survival Kit" by Joe Cummings, $17.95. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, 1992, Moon Publications produced its first edition of the 
"Thailand Handbook" by Carl Parkes, $16.95. It's packed with 568 pages of 
information and maps.

VIDEOS; 'COSTA RICA': FROM CITY TO JUNGLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETTY MARTIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 COSTA RICA ( Mentor Productions, 60 minutes, 1993 ). 
</P>
<P>
 Costa Rica is a small Central American country of incredible natural beauty 
where "volcanoes are the architects," says the video narrator. When the 
mountain peaks collide with the heavy rain (more than 100 inches a year in some 
areas), spectacular lakes, rivers, waterfalls and lush rain forests are 
created. Much of this, plus the lovely beaches that dot its shores, has been 
preserved in national parks and biological preserves. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewers tour some of these complex ecosystems, among them the remote, primeval 
Rara Avis National Park; Monteverde, a "cloud" forest (its moisture comes from 
clouds, not rain, and it is also the site of a dairy community founded by North 
American Quakers), and Manuel Antonio Park, noted for its beautiful beaches. 
The video provides information on park locations, accessibility and the 
availability of accommodations. Efforts are continuously being made to preserve 
and regenerate the parks. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the capital of San Jose, viewers visit the 3,000-year-old 
pre-Columbian ruins at Guayabo and the rushing Reventazon River and valley. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose is a pleasant mix of old-Spanish elegance and modern architecture. As 
viewers tour the city with its lovely parks, public buildings, hotels and open 
markets, the narrator points out the blend of Incan, Mayan and Aztec cultures 
that make up Costa Rican heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 A visit to the Caribbean coast explores the palm-fringed shore of Puerto 
Limon, Costa Rica's most important port. It's also the terminus for the 
cross-country railroads and for barge trips to Tortuguero National Park, where 
the Atlantic green turtle lays its eggs. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapes are available from Mentor Productions, P.O. Box 1148, San Clemente, 
Calif. 92674-1148; telephone (714) 498-3954. Price: $29.95 (plus tax and 
postage). 
</P>
<P>
 SAN FELIPE ( Budget Dubs USA, 50 minutes, 1993 ). 
</P>
<P>
 The once-sleepy Mexican fishing village of San Felipe in Baja is becoming a 
popular destination for the recreational vehicle traveler. Located just two 
hours south of the California border on the Gulf of California, it offers wide, 
nearly deserted beaches, fishing, friendly people, spectacular sunsets and the 
experience and flavor of a foreign destination. 
</P>
<P>
 The video gives tips on driving in Mexico and road conditions (generally 
good). 
</P>
<P>
 The video lists what to take with you -- clothing recommendations, spare auto 
parts, medication and favorite foods. 
</P>
<P>
 The journey begins in the border town of El Centro and crosses into Mexico at 
Mexicali. After a brief tour and film of RV parks in Mexicali, a tour is taken 
through the countryside to San Felipe. Near town, RV parks and campgrounds 
become more numerous, and the quality improves. A narrator discusses the 
amenities of each. San Felipe offers pretty beaches and modern streets lined 
with shops and cafes that feature fish tacos. 
</P>
<P>
 The video lists places covered in the film and how to reach them for 
information or reservations. 
</P>
<P>
 Tapes are available from Budget Dubs USA, 11555 Coley River Circle, Suite D, 
Fountain Valley, Calif. 92708; tel. (800) 248-3827. Price: $18.95 (plus tax and 
postage).

HOW'S THAT AGAIN? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was reassuring to learn ("Travel Insider," July 24) that Metro Rail won't 
be connecting to LAX because (airport and Federal Aviation Administration 
officials said that) "the Green Line's path could distract pilots with its 
lights, befuddle radar with electromagnetic emissions and stand in the way of 
low-flying aircraft in emergencies." Quick! Will someone please inform airport 
officials in London, Frankfurt, Chicago, Dallas-Fort Worth and all those other 
progressive cities that they might be in danger? And to think I was blaming the 
taxi lobby.

STEAMED IN NORWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dale Brown only mentioned the coastal steamer that serves the Lofotens 
("Norway's Magnetic North," June 12).Other readers may be interested in them. 
In May, my husband and I took a six-day cruise on a steamer from Kirkenes to 
Bergen. While the scenery was spectacular along the coastline, the Lofotens 
were the high point. The steamer was fascinating because it carried cargo and 
mail, as well as passengers, and stopped at many small ports along the way.

DATA FOR DUDES

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As an avid dude ranch vacationer, I read "Say Howdy Dude" (July 17) with 
considerable interest. The two ranches you covered were both large in terms of 
guest capacity; there are many ranches that accommodate 30 or fewer, and these 
have a distinctly different feeling, marked by a far more flexible structure. 
Also, Eugene Kilgore's "Ranch Vacations," distributed by John Muir 
publications, is an excellent source on dude ranches, fly fishing ranches and 
cross-country skiing ranches.

 "Vacationing With Your Pet!" by Eileen Barish is a book every pet owner who 
travels should have.You can order it from Pet Friendly Publications at (800) 
496-2665. It's $14.95 plus $3.75 shipping and handling (and worth every

MEXICO ON THE CUSP; THE TALE OF A REVOLUTIONARY AND AN ASSASSIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Victor Perera, Victor Perera, who just returned from Mexico, is author of 
Unfinished Conquest: The Guatemalan Tragedy (California) and co-author, with 
Robert D. Bruce, of Last Lords of Palenque: The Lacandon Mayas of the Mexican 
Rain Forest (California). His memoir, Rites: A Guatemalan Boyhood is due out in 
paperback from Mercury House this fall. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Poor Salinas de Gortari," goes a recent joke at the expense of Mexico's 
president. "On Dec. 30, he went to bed thinking he was North American. On Jan. 
1, he woke up knowing he is Guatemalan." The New Year's Day Zapatista uprising 
near Mexico's Guatemalan border in Chiapas, six days after Mexico ratified the 
North American Free Trade Agreement, and the assassination, 12 weeks later, of 
presidential candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio in Tijuana are two reminders of how 
far Mexico has yet to travel to awake as a first-world nation. 
</P>
<P>
 The proliferating fissures in the Institutional Revolutionary Party have 
rendered obsolete Mario Vargas Llosa's mordant assessment of the PRI as "the 
perfect dictatorship," because it was able to maintain an iron hold on the 
country behind a carefully orchestrated illusion of democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The assassination of Colosio and the uprising of more than 1,000 dispossessed 
Mayan Indians who make up the Zapatista Army of National Liberation at the 
opposite poles of the country have done far more than crumble Mexico's 
democratic facade: They have exposed the fragility at the core of PRI's -- and 
the country's -- post-revolutionary structures and awakened fears of an 
accelerated drift toward violence and disintegration that could turn Mexico 
into our hemisphere's Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 As the dust begins to settle, two men are seen to bear a disproportionate 
responsibility for this unprecedented reversal in Mexico's fortunes -- and in 
its conception of itself. A preliminary government inquiry has determined that 
Mario Aburto Martinez acted alone when he assassinated Colosio on March 20. 
Fifteen hundred miles south of Tijuana in Chiapas, Mexico's poorest state, the 
enigmatic Subcomandante Marcos has emerged as the architect and guiding genius 
of the Zapatista uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to imagine two more disparate figures bound by a common resort to 
armed violence to achieve political objectives. And while the poker-faced 
Aburto's justifications for shooting Colosio remain mired in murky, 
self-serving rhetoric, Marcos has exploded on the public arena as a loquacious 
exponent of revolution, craftily blending Emiliano Zapata's passion for social 
justice with Che Guevara's gift for phrases that can appear to alter history. 
</P>
<P>
 But this only hints at Marcos' gift for language, which has enthralled 
Mexico's political and intellectual Establishment, along with millions of 
disaffected peasants and laborers in Oaxaca, Hidalgo, Guerrero, Michoacan and 
other poor Mexican states. Marcos' almost daily missives to the press are 
enlivened by witty asides, Aesopian fables and flights of lyricism that create 
a sense of intimacy with Mexicans from a wide range of social and economic 
backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 For all his literary talents, Marcos' greatest coup may be his success in 
protecting the mystery of his identity even as he turns into Mexico's most 
familiar public icon. Chamula Indian vendors here have started a cottage 
industry of ski-masked Marcos dolls they sell to tourists, and his effigy 
appears on a brand of condoms marketed as "El Levantamiento," the Uprising. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos' disguise draws on a Mexican tradition of masked crusaders from El 
Zorro to the caped Super Barrios of Mexico City's slums. His mask allows him to 
claim kinship with homosexuals, college-educated professionals and illiterate 
peasants, not to mention the millions of Mexicans who have crossed the northern 
border in search of economic betterment (one rumor has Marcos living for a time 
as a gay waiter in San Francisco). 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the black ski mask and pipe and the bullet belts strapped across his 
chest, Marcos is continually evolving. Following the bellicose tone of the 
Zapatistas' Second Declaration from the Lacandon Jungle, which called for armed 
revolution if the government refused to step down, Marcos has heeded his mentor 
Carlos Monsivais, as well as Carlos Fuentes and other members of the 
influential San Angel group, and has begun to move from the "Professional of 
Violence" to his emerging status as Professional Conciliator. For the national 
democratic convention celebrated last week in the Zapatistas' Lacandon jungle 
outpost, Marcos invited peasant and labor union delegations from around the 
country, but he also extended invitations to writers and intellectuals of 
right, left and center, whom he addressed in graceful epistles published in La 
Jornada. The polished replies by Monsivais, Fuentes, Enrique Krauze and other 
prominent writers and shapers of public opinion have helped revive what 
Monsivais calls "the nearly extinct" art of epistolary discourse. 
</P>
<P>
 Another gift of Marcos is his ability to turn the mesmerized media into 
Zapatista mouthpieces, and supposedly impartial mediators into allies and 
stalking horses for his initiatives. Not only La Jornada and the prestigious 
weekly Proceso on the left, but even the staid Financiero -- Mexico's rough 
equivalent of the Wall Street Journal -- have become sounding boards for 
Marcos' political agenda. President Salinas' special envoy, Luis Camacho Solis, 
enhanced Marcos' image as a skillful negotiator far more than he helped his own 
reputation, after the peace agreement they signed was rejected by the Zapatista 
rank and file. 
</P>
<P>
 The mediation of Bishop Samuel Ruiz of Chiapas between the government and the 
Zapatistas nearly foundered when he and Marcos were discovered to see 
eye-to-eye on replacing the PRI with a government responsive to the needs of 
the poor and disenfranchised. Ruiz's thinly veiled support for the Zapatista 
cause has further strained his relations with the Vatican over his espousal of 
the leftist theology of liberation, and fueled his longstanding feud with 
Chiapas' right-wing politicians and cattle ranchers. 
</P>
<P>
 If Salinas and the PRI make good on their promise to guarantee a clean and 
swift election, and declare a winner on the same day, Salinas and Marcos could 
emerge as unexpected allies, co-protagonists of the country's transition to 
democratic reform. Regardless of which candidate is elected, it is increasingly 
evident that no party will be able to govern Mexico without the support of the 
others. Both Cuauhtemoc Cardenas' left-leaning Democratic Revolutionary Party 
and the right-of-center National Action Party -- whose candidate, Diego 
Fernandez de Cevallos, is running second behind the PRI's Ernesto Zedillo -- 
lack infrastructure, and the PRI is morally bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 In the extraordinary climate of distrust prevailing in Mexico, hardly anyone 
believes the polls that show Zedillo far ahead of his rivals. And the majority 
of Mexicans remain convinced that the PRI's old guard had a hand in the 
assassination of Colosio, who was attempting to return PRI to its grass roots. 
</P>
<P>
 The restraint shown by both Salinas and Marcos during the first days of the 
Zapatista uprising prevented a much-larger blood bath in the Lacandon jungle, 
where fewer than 200 combatants and civilians were reported to have been 
killed. On the other hand, if Cardenas' prognostication of a massive fraud is 
borne out -- he is charging that 5 million ballots have been duplicated by PRI 
officials -- Mexico could turn in the direction of Aburto: more magnicidios , 
and uprisings by armed peasant groups throughout Mexico, as Marcos has 
predicted, in an ominous preamble to civil war and Balkanization. 
</P>
<P>
 There is ample precedent for both options in Mexico's 1910 revolution, which 
produced Zapata and land reforms, but also led to the assassinations of three 
presidents and two revolutionary leaders -- Zapata and Pancho Villa -- in fewer 
than 15 years.  
</P>
<P>
 In the just-concluded convention in the Lacandon jungle, the 5,000 delegates 
and the Zapatistas called once more for the resignation of Salinas and the 
dissolution of the PRI. And they threatened to mobilize a general strike that 
would paralyze the country if the PRI fails to deliver on its pledge to conduct 
"squeaky clean" elections. 
</P>
<P>
 A week before the presidential vote, Mexico sits on the cusp, poised on the 
threshold of peaceful transition to a democratic phase of Mexico's uncompleted 
revolution, or a return to the assassinations, armed insurgency and incipient 
civil war of the 1920s, and the first 90 days of 1994.*

WHY HEALTH-CARE REFORM MAY BE BEYOND SAVING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By William Schneider, William Schneider, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
political analyst for CNN. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Comprehensive health-care reform is in big trouble. Here's the reason: 
President Bill Clinton has lost the support of a crucial political ally -- the 
middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the support of the middle class, the odds are against the President on 
health care. Those odds worsened considerably last week with Clinton's stunning 
defeat in the House of Representatives on the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of Congress weren't afraid of the President. They figured there was no 
price to pay for defying him. Imagine what would have happened to a congressman 
who crossed Lyndon B. Johnson or Ronald Reagan on a vote like that. 
</P>
<P>
 In politics, where there's no fear, there's no clout. If the President 
couldn't get members to cast an easy vote on a popular measure like the crime 
bill, imagine how hard it will be to get them to cast a tough vote on 
health-care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't the way it was supposed to be. Clinton got elected President as 
the champion of "people who work hard and play by the rules." That's what being 
a "New Democrat" means. The "Old Democrats" were the ones who wanted to tax the 
middle class to pay for social-welfare programs for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now look at what's happened. A CNN-USA Today-Gallup poll taken last week asked 
people who they thought would benefit most from health-care reform: 
"upper-class Americans, the middle class, the poor, or everyone about equally"? 
Answer: the poor. Who did people think would be hurt most by reform? Answer: 
the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, this is strange, because what created the health-care issue in the first 
place was middle-class panic. The recession of 1990-91 had a devastating impact 
on white-collar employment. It created a terrifying prospect for middle-class 
workers who had no unions to protect them. Losing their jobs meant losing their 
health insurance -- and their families' health insurance. To make matters 
worse, health-care costs were rising out of sight. Individual health insurance 
was unaffordable. Medical problems carried the threat of impoverishment. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Harris Wofford who showed Democrats the way in November, 1991. He asked 
a devastating question: If every criminal has a right to a lawyer, shouldn't 
every American citizen have a right to a doctor? With that, Wofford trounced 
the Bush Administration's stand-in candidate, former Atty. Gen. Dick 
Thornburgh, in the Pennsylvania U.S. Senate election. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton took up the health-care issue and rode it all the way to the White 
House. He even figured out how to make sure the issue appealed to the middle 
class. Clinton insisted throughout on "universal coverage." Universal means 
available to everybody; in other words, not means-tested. If a program is 
means-tested, the benefits go to the people who need them the most, i.e., the 
poor. And the middle class pays the bill. That's Old Democratic thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The definition of the middle class in this country is simple: neither rich nor 
poor. Middle-class people know there are people poorer than themselves. They 
know government programs based on "need" will help poor people, because their 
needs are the greatest. Government programs like Social Security and Medicare 
are not based on need. That's why they are politically sacrosanct. They help 
everyone, whether they need it or not. That's why such "entitlement" programs 
are so expensive: You have to bribe the middle class to support programs that 
only incidentally help the poor. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton deliberately modeled his health-care plan after Social Security. 
Remember the health security card he held up in his State of the Union speech 
last January? It looked just like a Social Security card. It was supposed to. 
Clinton figured that his dogged insistence on universal coverage was the key to 
winning the middle class. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats played to the middle-class fear of losing health insurance. In 
introducing his bill Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) 
called it a matter of "simple justice." He said, "The difference between secure 
coverage and unaffordable policy can be as heartbreaking as one sick child. 
That's not fair or right. That's why we need reform." 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans discovered another middle-class concern -- that the federal 
government will have too much control over the nation's health-care system. 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said the "Clinton-Mitchell bill" was 
based on "the principle that government knows best." If the bill passed, Dole 
warned, "the federal government will have broad and sweeping new powers in 
almost every aspect of health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's poll tested those two fears. Which concerns Americans the most -- 
that Congress will pass a plan that gives the federal government too much 
control over health care, or that Congress will pass a plan that fails to 
guarantee health insurance for every American? 
</P>
<P>
 Bad news for Clinton. Too much government was a bigger concern than too little 
health insurance, by 53%-40%. 
</P>
<P>
 The public now sees comprehensive health-care reform as a typical Democratic 
social-welfare program -- one that helps the poor, hurts the middle class and 
creates bigger government. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? Three things. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the recession ended. The recovery hasn't been strong enough for anyone 
to call it a Clinton boom. But it has been strong enough for the middle-class 
panic over health care to subside. That, plus the fact that health-care 
providers, fearful of reform, have begun to reorganize themselves. As a result, 
the rapid inflation of health care has slowed considerably. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the Clinton Administration displayed awesome political stupidity. It 
turned health-care reform over to a 500-person task force of self-anointed 
experts, meeting for months in secret, chaired by a sinister liberal activist 
and a driven First Lady. Who elected them? They came up with a 1,300-page 
document that could not have been better designed to scare the wits out of 
Americans. It was the living embodiment of Big Government -- or Big Brother. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's in there?" people asked. The Health Insurance Assn. of America 
introduced Harry and Louise to give us the answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, of course, the Clinton plan has been abandoned. As it happens, the new 
and improved plan designed by Mitchell is 1,410 pages long. It makes quite a 
prop in the Senate floor debate. Watch Republican senators pick it up -- oof! 
-- and wave it at the cameras. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, the Administration made a serious miscalculation. It assumed it could 
sell health-care reform to the middle class as the logical extension of Social 
Security and Medicare -- "the last unfinished business of the New Deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of health-care reform, Mitchell said Tuesday, "will find themselves 
on the wrong side of history, just as the opponents of Social Security did, 
just as the opponents of Medicare did. . . . Americans couldn't be persuaded to 
repeal Social Security and Medicare by the same arguments now being made 
against health-care reform." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you in the press ought to go up and question some of these people 
about what their position is on Medicare," Hillary Rodham Clinton said in an 
interview with reporters, "and whether or not they believe mandatory payroll 
deductions to finance health care for Americans over 65 is socialized medicine. 
Because of course it isn't." 
</P>
<P>
 But the analogy doesn't hold. For one thing, the biggest single change in 
American political attitudes since the 1960s has been the collapse of 
confidence in government. In the 1930s, when Social Security was passed, 
desperate Americans believed the federal government could save them. It did. In 
the 1960s, when Medicare and civil rights were passed, old people and black 
people believed the federal government could protect them. It did. But in the 
1990s, Americans are not so sure about either of these things. Middle-class 
Americans are no longer convinced that the federal government is on their side. 
</P>
<P>
 There's another reason why the analogy doesn't hold. When Social Security came 
up in the 1930s, most people didn't have old-age insurance. Pension plans were 
meager or nonexistent. Most of the elderly had to rely on the tender mercies of 
their relatives. Social Security gave them something they didn't have.  
</P>
<P>
 When Medicare came up in the 1960s, most old people didn't have adequate 
health insurance. Americans get their health insurance through employment, 
after all, and the vast majority of the elderly are not employed. The elderly, 
who have the greatest need for health care, faced prohibitive costs. Medicare 
gave them something they didn't have.  
</P>
<P>
 But the vast majority of middle-class Americans today do have health 
insurance. And they say they are satisfied with both the quality of their 
health care and the quality of their health insurance. So what are they worried 
about? Well, they're worried about losing their health insurance if they lose 
their job. And they're worried about being able to afford it if the rates go 
up. Those are the problems they want health-care reform to fix. They are 
limited, specific problems. 
</P>
<P>
 They see the Administration's health-care plan as doing far more than that. It 
aims to reorganize the whole health-care system so that the government will 
give them something they already have , namely, health insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 People's biggest fear about the Administration's health-care plan is that it 
will take what they already have and make it worse. Members of Congress report 
that they have been getting more calls and letters from constituents who ask, 
"What's going to happen to me if this bill passes?" than from people who ask, 
"What's going to happen to me if this bill doesn't pass?" 
</P>
<P>
 Last week's poll puts that issue to the test. "Thinking about just your own 
health-care situation," the poll asked, "which worries you more -- that you 
could end up without health insurance if Congress doesn't pass a bill, or that 
you could end up worse off than you are now if Congress does pass a bill?" By a 
solid margin, 54%-30%, people are more worried about what will happen to them 
if health-care reform passes. 
</P>
<P>
 That's exactly why the President's plan is in serious trouble. The 
Administration assumes that middle-class people are driven by the fear of not 
getting the additional security they want. But there is another, much larger 
fear driving them. That is the fear of losing the security they already have.*

THE MORAL CHALLENGE OF ANOTHER POLICE BEATING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Ruben Navarrette Jr., Ruben Navarrette Jr. is author of A Darker Shade of 
Crimson: Odyssey of a Harvard Chicano (Bantam) and co-host of Twentysomething 
Talk on KMPC. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some Angelenos, perhaps hoping to keep the city's recent ugly history from 
repeating itself, are rushing to point out that the videotaped beatings of 
17-year-old Felipe Soltero and Rodney G. King cannot be compared. Nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 When the three separate investigations of the Soltero beating are concluded, 
our suspicions will probably be confirmed: Soltero and King, while not 
identical twins, are victims of the same crime. Again, we have the disturbing 
imagery of a police officer of one color viciously beating a suspect of 
another. Again, with the revelation that Compton Officer Michael Jackson was 
disciplined a few years ago for beating another Latino youth, we have a pattern 
of behavior by the officer against other suspects of the same color. And, 
again, given the worsening friction between African Americans and Latinos in 
U.S. inner cities, which are increasingly Latino, we have some reason to take 
seriously charges by Soltero's attorney that the Latino youth's beating may 
have been racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 " Ay, Pobrecito . How could they treat someone like that?" my mother asked in 
a tone eerily reminiscent of the one she used to ask a similar question three 
years ago. In the first 24 hours after a local television station broadcast the 
tape, an elderly African American woman pleaded her case to a radio talk-show 
host, saying that young Soltero must have done something to deserve a beating 
like that; somewhere, I have heard that before. 
</P>
<P>
 But put away all that you learned from the King beating and its destructive 
aftermath. Notwithstanding the similarities between the two cases, the beating 
of a Latino immigrant by an African American police officer promises to 
challenge us in new and provocative ways. 
</P>
<P>
 For the city's African American community, the challenge is to be morally 
consistent in its outrage over yet another instance of police brutality. Three 
years ago, African American leaders were quick to unequivocally condemn the 
beating of a black motorist by white police officers. Now, I expect -- and hope 
-- these same leaders will move as swiftly to condemn something they never 
would have wished for -- a police beating in which an African American male is 
not the victim, but the alleged perpetrator. 
</P>
<P>
 For the city's sprawling Latino community, the challenge is to rise to its 
feet in protest over an injustice that other Americans simply have not 
tolerated when directed at them. Five hundred years of relative passivity, 
mixed with a touch of fatalism, have not done much to elevate the social, 
economic and political stature of the country's fastest-growing ethnic 
minority. Whether the issue is police brutality, the rights of farm workers or 
an immoral "Save Our State" initiative, Latinos in the United States, when 
faced with injustice, have a responsibility to a Jeffersonian ethic that goes 
well beyond rubbing rosaries and hoping for the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, there are longstanding cultural characteristics that may impede 
Latino protest. Among Mexican-Americans in the United States -- a group much 
more conservative than recently arrived Latino immigrants -- those who are 
intent on stirring up protest within their community over police brutality must 
first overcome that same community's traditional and well-grounded support for 
law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the story, almost obscured, that emerged from the ashes of the Los 
Angeles riots about the group of Mexican-American youths who returned 
merchandise that others had stolen from a Sears store in East Los Angeles, 
telling the startled store clerk that "we don't do this in East L.A." I 
remember my father's story about his father's warning to him that a policeman 
was a kind of surrogate parent deserving of respect. " Tienes tres padres ," 
the old man of Mexico used to say. "You have three fathers." My grandfather 
explained that, at home, he was the authority figure to be obeyed; at school, 
the title was transferred to the teacher, and, on the street, it belonged to 
the policeman. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the weight of that sort of tradition, there may be an inclination 
within some segments of the Latino community to pay deference to the badge and 
acquiesce to the suspicion that young Soltero somehow deserved his beating. 
That may not only contradict the facts of the case. It would be morally wrong. 
Whether or not there was provocation is as irrelevant as whether King really 
did, on that night, lunge at the officers who were beating him or make obscene 
gestures at a female officer nearby. In striking Soltero's head with what 
appears to be an inappropriate use of the baton and by dropping his knee on the 
back of the teen-ager's neck, the officer seemed to go well beyond the point of 
"all necessary force to subdue the suspect." Furthermore, deference to the 
badge would be an affront to a proud 500-year-old tradition of weathering 
discrimination and other adversities with an air of dignity that, we should 
remember, includes standing up for what is right. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, for fair-minded Americans of all colors, the Compton beating poses 
another challenge crucial to the 21st Century. Even as the United States 
becomes increasingly Latino and Asian, far too many Americans still define race 
relations within the narrow, inadequate and antiquated paradigm of black and 
white. As newspaper editors and television news directors rush to distinguish 
Soltero from King, it appears as if America has, in its collective 
consciousness, room for only one minority at a time. Too many white liberals, 
perhaps seeking to atone for centuries of the horrible treatment dealt 
African-Americans, seem to view as much more outrageous a white police officer 
beating a black man than a black officer beating a Latino. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as we all know, America is changing. When the Census Bureau tells us that 
by the year 2010, Latinos will surpass African Americans as the country's 
largest ethnic group; when the author of the Kerner Commission report, warning 
of two societies, one black, one white, feels compelled to come forward and 
adjust the scenario to include Latinos; when the secretary of housing and urban 
development, a traditional enclave for African Americans, is suddenly Latino 
and when there are more Latinos in Los Angeles than either African Americans or 
whites, that outdated paradigm is simply no longer of use. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, America is changing. And change, so often, brings fear and entrenchment. 
My sense is that in Compton, whose population is now estimated to be majority 
Latino, they already know that.*

THE NATION; WEARY OF PUBLIC SCANDALS, ARE AMERICANS GROWING MORE TOLERANT OF 
ETHICAL LAPSES? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the Whitewater hearings over (for now), the betting in Washington is on 
how long it will be before Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger C. Altman -- widely 
said to be among the walking political dead since revelations of his contacts 
with the White House during the investigation of Madison Guaranty Savings and 
Loan -- is banished from office in disgrace. After all, isn't that how modern 
scandals work? Reputations ruined, careers blighted, lives scarred? 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be so sure. There is a limit to outrage among the political elite, and 
the moralism of the past years may have left people too tired to keep meting 
out Draconian punishments for ethical lapses. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the Clintonites involved in Whitewater don't deserve a little 
ruining. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton officials who testified had had every opportunity to learn from 
Watergate and Iran-Contra history, and they seemed motivated by nothing more 
than politics-as-usual. Yet, these people were at least as weaselly and evasive 
as their recent predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 The person most embarrassed, and embarrassing, at the hearings was, of course, 
Altman himself. The Senate had previously asked him about conversations he 
might have had with White House staff during the Madison investigation; he had 
owned up to just one "substantive" contact. After he testified, though, other 
contracts kept turning up, and at the just-ended hearing, Altman did a poor job 
of explaining why representatives shouldn't think he had deceived them. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Altman had many fellow squirmers among the witnesses. Treasury 
Secretary Lloyd Bentsen portrayed himself, implausibly, as ignorant of Madison 
goings-on. Treasury aide Joshua L. Steiner had kept a diary that vividly 
described White House pressure in the Madison case; in the hearings, he tried, 
unconvincingly, to impeach his own writings. 
</P>
<P>
 Presidential staffer Harold M. Ickes, in a deposition he gave before the 
hearings, contradicted Altman on what information the Treasury deputy had 
divulged to the White House. When Ickes testified, he stood by his account -- 
but also tried to discredit it, saying he was deaf in one ear and might have 
heard wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole performance was discouraging. Twenty years of turning ourselves 
inside out on the subject of ethics in government, and this is where we've 
gotten ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, it's not clear that the glare of klieg lights and the bombast of 
senators will serve their traditional post-Watergate function of endangering 
the liberty and fortunes of the alleged perpetrators. Take Bentsen: If key 
members of Congress were to say they had lost confidence in him, he would be 
finished. But after his long career on the Hill, they clearly will not punish 
him in this way; they will allow him to refurbish his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentsen may well begin this refurbishment by getting rid of his 
Whitewater-tainted crew. For instance, Treasury Department general counsel Jean 
Hanson is said to be ready to depart government and return to her old law firm, 
which says it would be happy to have her back. That's not exactly what you 
would call professional ruination. 
</P>
<P>
 In the same way, should Altman leave the Administration, his 
investment-banking colleagues would welcome him home. True, the business world 
has gone through an ethics inflation, with increasingly harsh public and 
private penalties imposed for even non-intentional violations of the rules. 
Still, the verbal footwork Altman performed before Congress is highly valued in 
deal makers, who habitually say different things to different people in order 
to get the job done. 
</P>
<P>
 White House Counsel Lloyd N. Cutler suffered damage at the hearings, 
especially for failing to see that some in Congress might reasonably view him 
as a partisan of the President's rather than an impartial 
counselor-investigator. But Cutler is due to leave his job soon, anyway, and 
his reputation in Washington is strong enough to see him through the current 
unpleasantness. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Steiner, at the beginning of his career, has no base of power to 
cushion him. On the other hand, he stands accused of merely a) youthful 
imprudence, for keeping a diary, and b) loyalty strong enough to impel him to 
make a fool of himself. For many potential employers, the second quality 
outweighs the first; Steiner will find takers for his talents. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Ickes has his own type of protection. He is an ally of a First Lady 
who is a fierce loyalist, who had to fire one close associate in former White 
House Counsel Bernard W. Nussbaum, and who will resist repeating the process. 
</P>
<P>
 So what has happened to the modern scandal mania we hear about, the one said 
to be so merciless in smashing public reputations? We are adjusting, that's 
what has happened; we're fine-tuning our standards. 
</P>
<P>
 If you need further demonstration, consider this: The men leading the Senate 
Whitewater hearings were Donald W. Riegle Jr. (D-Mich.) and Alfonse M. D'Amato 
(R-N.Y.). D'Amato was recently in serious trouble over favor-peddling in his 
office, while Riegle was a star defendant in the Keating Five scandal. But at 
the Whitewater hearings, their authority was not challenged; they were not 
laughed out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 Another senator, Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), has written that when a 
society is plagued by more disorder than it can tolerate, it redefines its 
terms, so that things once thought disorderly will now be considered normal. 
</P>
<P>
 So it is with the question of what we will regard as morally ruinous: The 
surfeit of scandal seems to be turning us into morally hardened cases. This 
weariness means the Administration's critics will have to produce more than 
they have if they intend to destroy Clintonite reputations in the 
old-fashioned, thoroughgoing sense of the word.*

THE WORLD; DON'T ALLOW THE ATLANTIC ALLIANCE TO LANGUISH INTO IRRELEVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Henry A. Kissinger, Former Secretary of State Henry A. Kissinger frequently 
writes for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 By far the most worrisome aspect of U.S. foreign policy is the progressive 
erosion of the Atlantic Alliance. To be sure, the disintegration of the Soviet 
empire, the retreat of Soviet armies and the unification of Germany require 
major changes in the structure and purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization. But what is happening is not adaptation; rather, it is decline 
into an empty shell, with nary a public discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 On his three trips to Europe this year, Bill Clinton discussed the alliance as 
if it were a Cold War relic. He defined its significance almost exclusively in 
relation to the Partnership for Peace, which, in his view, is not about 
security but about reconciliation. Having been approved by the NATO council, 
joined by Russia and a host of other Central and East European countries, the 
partnership is now a fact of life. But it is not too late to prevent it from 
submerging the Atlantic Alliance, so patiently and so beneficially constructed 
over 40 years and still so necessary to deal with a world in turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
 The Partnership for Peace is a hybrid of the Wilsonian concept of collective 
security and of the Henry Wallace ideology of the 1940s -- both of which reject 
the concept of alliance. NATO was designed for security, the partnership for 
reassurance. The Atlantic Alliance assumed that its threats came from outside 
the treaty area, while the partnership seeks to pacify threats within its area 
by affirmations of good intentions. This is what Clinton describes as the 
partnership's truly new aspect: "for the first time, all nation-states really 
do respect the territorial integrity of one another." 
</P>
<P>
 The novel aspect of Clinton's European policy is that it seeks to build the 
Atlantic area from East to West, reversing the architecture of the postwar 
period. But making Russia the hinge of U.S. Atlantic policy places an 
exorbitant strain on one of the most brittle nations. And it lures the United 
States into assigning a role to Germany that its leaders have not requested, 
its circumstances do not favor and that unnecessarily wounds Great Britain and 
France. During his visit to Berlin, Clinton called on Germany to assume a 
special responsibility for Eastern Europe and Russia, in particular; he called 
the U.S. relationship with Germany "singular" because Germany had a more 
"immediate and tangible concern" with relations with Russia "even than our 
other friends in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing illustrates better the lack of historical perspective plaguing current 
foreign policy. Even to hint at a solitary and preeminent role for a country 
whose disasters have been caused by its inability to manage a purely national 
policy in the center of the Continent is as disquieting to Germany's neighbors 
as it is to the architects of German postwar policy. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not without significance that, in responding to the President, 
Chancellor Helmut Kohl specifically invoked the legacy of Chancellor Konrad 
Adenauer -- to seek a major German role not on a purely national basis but as 
an integral part of the Atlantic Alliance and of the European Union. The impact 
of a so-called "singular" German-American relationship on the rest of Europe 
will be to foster separation of Western Europe from the United States, 
widespread fear in Eastern Europe and the isolation of Germany within Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 If present trends continue, NATO policy will become increasingly rudderless. 
Despite ritualistic assertions to the contrary, the Administration's Atlantic 
policy is creating two categories of frontier in Europe: those that are 
guaranteed are not threatened, and those that are threatened are not 
guaranteed. The result is a gray area in Eastern and Central Europe that the 
nations affected find severely disquieting and that can only tempt dangerous 
tendencies. No reassuring phrases can change the reality that Poland, 
partitioned four times by Russia in two centuries, thinks of Russia as a 
threat, not as a partner. 
</P>
<P>
 The countries joining the partnership are thus doing so to implement 
incompatible conceptions. The nations of Central and Eastern Europe are joining 
because they see it as a steppingstone into NATO. Russia is joining to drain 
NATO of content, as is evidenced by various Russian proposals amounting to a 
veto over NATO decisions. Thus, when U.S. leaders imply to Poland that NATO 
membership is just around the corner and to Russia that it can participate in 
any security arrangement open to its former satellites (in other words, join 
NATO eventually), confusion (and worse) is inevitable when the promissory notes 
fall due. 
</P>
<P>
 A coherent Atlantic policy has two requirements: to infuse the core alliance 
with a new sense of direction, including settling its membership; second, to 
separate its organizational activities from those of the partnership. 
</P>
<P>
 With respect to the first, these questions must be dealt with: What is the 
core NATO supposed to do? What are the common objectives? Indeed, what exactly 
is the core of NATO? 
</P>
<P>
 Until the question of membership in NATO is settled, the revitalization of the 
core Atlantic Alliance will languish. The partnership served a useful purpose 
in opening a discussion of NATO expansion. But further delay invites Germany 
and Russia to fill the vacuum between them either unilaterally or bilaterally. 
</P>
<P>
 So long as NATO and the partnership are merged organizationally, it will prove 
difficult to define common objectives for the core alliance. Twenty-two nations 
have already applied for membership in the partnership; scores are eligible. 
Each nation is supposed to come up with its own program of bilateral 
cooperation with NATO. No one familiar with how NATO operates can believe that, 
as now constituted, the alliance bureaucracy can plan individual partnership 
programs and simultaneously generate a creative adaptation of the alliance 
itself to the new circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia must be integrated into the international community. But since this is, 
above all, a political and economic challenge, NATO is not the best institution 
for that task. Russian membership in the political aspects of the G-7 meetings 
and participation in multilateral forums dealing with the Balkans and Korea are 
important. Bilateral consultations between Washington and Moscow will play a 
crucial role. The European Security Conference comprising all the nations 
eligible for the partnership was designed for precisely this role. The Atlantic 
Alliance was not. Why destroy the safety net when forums for reconciliation 
already exist?*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; REED TUCKSON; TAKING THE HEALING ART TO 
UNDERSERVED COMMUNITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Donna Mungen, Donna Mungen is a producer for the A&E Network and a 
contributor to National Public Radio's All Things Considered. Tuckson was 
interviewed in his office at Charles R. Drew University of Medicine. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Whether or not Congress passes a universal health-insurance bill, Dr. Reed V. 
Tuckson will shepherd in another generation of physicians and support staff 
committed to providing competent health care to American's underserved 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 As president of Charles R. Drew University of Medicine, one of the nation's 
four historically black medical universities -- and the only one west of the 
Mississippi -- the 43-year-old internist is dedicated to an innovative 
health-care philosophy that stresses a team approach between community 
residents and the medical profession. If he has his way and collaboration 
between community and doctor becomes the norm, Tuckson predicts that in the 
next century, the omnipotent position of physicians will diminish. 
</P>
<P>
 Before arriving in Los Angeles in 1991, Tuckson served for four years as 
public-health commissioner in his home town of Washington, D.C. A graduate of 
Howard University, he received his medical training at Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
 As a leader in public health, Tuckson's fiery criticism of the medical 
industry's neglect of the poor calls into question the moral values currently 
taught at the nation's medical schools. But the resistance he detects does not 
lessen his confidence in being able to infuse a mission of service to members 
of his medical parish. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuckson is actively involved in all phases of the operation at the King/Drew 
Medical complex. But it's only when discussing the next generation of healers 
that Tuckson's animated determination surfaces. Where others see only "gang 
members," Tuckson sees potential scientists, because he believes the least 
likely candidate to succeed can, with a little encouragement, be the best 
applicant.

 It is this vision that Tuckson brings to the red-brick Drew Hospital Training 
Program located adjacent to the recently opened Century Freeway. The complex 
stands in stark contrast to a neighborhood of small 1940s bungalows and 
multiplexes plastered with cryptic graffiti, discarded mattresses, plastic doll 
arms and whirling scrolls of trash.

 Question: Are you still confident about the passage of universal health care?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: I am optimistic we will achieve the fundamental moral responsibility 
of a civilized society: to ensure that all citizens have the opportunity to 
survive free of unnecessary and preventable human diseases. Unfortunately, I 
had not anticipated that Americans would not rally around this human mandate 
and that there would be this much apathy. I view that apathy with great 
concern, and I think this time in American history will be harshly judged. 
However, the game is not over and there is still the opportunity to gather in 
support of this basic notion called "universal access to health care." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your concept of universal health coverage?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Universal coverage means all citizens will have the opportunity to receive 
a basic, comprehensive set of health-care services that serves to promote their 
health, prevent disease, receive early diagnosis and treatment, in a 
cost-effective and appropriate manner, consistent with the needs for survival, 
free of pain, misery and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is there so much apathy?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It is very difficult to engage in any serious public-policy debate 
involving complex issues. Americans seem to have very short attention spans, 
and much money has been spent on, and great professional expertise applied to, 
creating confusion. The other thing is there are many other issues on the 
agenda that seem to take precedence, such as criminal justice. While I think 
both issues are important, it is sad that we would make decisions about crime 
and seem so uninterested, relatively speaking, in whether or not our fellow 
citizens live or die. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you agree with the criticism that physicians were not allowed enough 
input into the Administration's plan?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Early on, perhaps, but that mistake was quickly rectified by the White 
House when they invited in and solicited physicians' input. . . . I know, 
because I was asked. However, I am saddened that this profession of people who 
have taken a sacred oath to be concerned about whether or not the citizens of 
their society live or die would be in opposition to, and not as supportive of, 
realizing this goal. We have the world's finest medical system, but despite the 
breadth and depth of our wealth and expertise, we have failed to make even the 
most basic of health-care service regularly available to millions, and this 
disparity is a hole in the heart of this nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why the lack of concern within the medical community?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We certainly have not been taught enough about our responsibility to 
address this neglect. We in the profession of medicine too often reflect the 
values of the larger society, which celebrates narcissistic self-indulgence, as 
opposed to living committed lives that bring us to the most fundamental human 
responsibility, which is to care about the quality of the survival of your 
fellow citizen. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Los Angeles leads the nation in deaths from gunshot wounds among young 
African-American males. Have we turned our backs on them?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The community-based infrastructure that has historically been the salvation 
of the African-American community was left to deteriorate for a variety of very 
complicated reasons. The multitude of challenges confronting some of today's 
youth creates the absence of the concept of a "meaningful future." Without a 
sense of connection to a society larger than oneself, it becomes very difficult 
for the health community to persuade people to initiate behaviors that are 
consistent with long-term survival. So, as doctors, when we try to make the 
fight for not smoking cigarettes -- so you won't get cancer at 45 or heart 
disease at 50 -- we find our children say back that the leading cause of death 
in their community is homicide. So what difference does it make if we smoke 
cigarettes? 
</P>
<P>
 As we work toward trying to get more social equity and reform, I am most 
encouraged that the answer will happen at the community grass-roots level, 
which in the black community has been the church. I'm very encouraged by those 
church leaders who recognize that responsibility and are stepping forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can we help these ill-prepared urban men-children?  
</P>
<P>
 A: We will need some new and innovative educational experiences for these 
young people. . . . We regularly bring to the hospital so-called gang members, 
and we spend a lot of time talking to them. They have an irresistible urge to 
analyze the forces around them, and they are struggling -- too often alone -- 
to make sense of it all. There are geniuses walking among us and they get 
labeled criminals and other throw-away terms that fail to grapple with who they 
really are. . . 
</P>
<P>
 But what really concerns me is that the world economy is undergoing a rapid 
evolution, and there will be approximately six major industries defining global 
competition in the next century. These industries are all heavily based on 
science and math. However, when you examine the curriculum and the quality of 
instruction in many of our inner-city schools, it becomes clear we are 
producing millions of children who are completely irrelevant to the future 
economy of this country. The inevitable consequences are disastrous, and our 
children understand that the crime bill, with its heavy reliance on more 
prisons are simply prison cells waiting with their names etched on them. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How can the medical community stem this tide?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The major health challenges confronting underserved communities are 
essentially ones that are at the heart of how life is lived. Health is the 
place where all the social forces converge. It is important for physicians to 
work in close collaboration to stimulate the resources in the community and 
help to develop them in a pro-active maneuver. However, there is a certain 
humility physicians must exhibit. We must come with a profound sense of respect 
for communities' abilities, capacities and opportunities to determine their own 
course. I want to ultimately get away from the notion that physicians are 
brilliant, smart people who have the answers and will dictate their 
prescriptions to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is violence an American disease or the byproduct of neglect?  
</P>
<P>
 A: America has historically been -- and continues to be -- a very violent 
society, and that violence transcends class, race and gender. So many of the 
definitions of America -- in terms of our national ego, our popular culture or 
our international status -- are based on our capacity to exert our will on the 
world. These are issues America will have to grapple with in a mature way if we 
are going to realize our national destiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How does this violence affect your program?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The heroic people who staff the King/Drew Medical Center daily confront an 
absolutely disgraceful human tragedy of broken and torn bodies of our children 
. . . The effect is not only the destruction of so many beautiful children -- 
potential geniuses -- but our energies are displaced from early diagnoses or 
effectively curing and managing other diseases that exist in great magnitude in 
South-Central Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 The resources available to address this burden are relatively meager and 
inadequate, and the amount of violence-related injury presented to our hospital 
consumes an overwhelming amount of our resources. So, in this case, violent 
death becomes a contributor to many other deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you see as the mission of your graduates?  
</P>
<P>
 A: To be competent in their care for people who are medically underserved and 
to develop new knowledge in the context of that service. Also, our mission is 
to be concerned and smart about the survival of people who are dying at rates 
that are absolutely unacceptable for a civilized society. This means our 
students have to be twice as good as other medical students. Like everyone 
else, they have to know how to take care of the human organism; but they also 
have to understand the intimate relationship between the patient and his social 
environment. You see, I live by a mantra written by children from Washington, 
D.C., who are part of The Living Theatre Stage. And they say: "Pity and 
compassion in a world in pain means nothing at all unless it leads to change. 
We've seen enough pain, we've seen enough sorrow, but what we do with our lives 
must make the world better for our people tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is unique about your faculty?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Our current faculty comes from all over the country and the world, and they 
gravitate to us, because they believe in our principles and mission. Some of 
our faculty grew up blocks from Drew and have dedicated their lives to serving 
here. Also, we are starting from the age of three months on to grow our future 
faculty from an unbroken continuum of science and math, through our Early 
Childhood Center, through our Headstart Program, through our Saturday Science 
Academy, through our Medical Magnet High School to our Allied Health School 
and, finally, to our Post Graduate Medical Training Residency Program. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You finished at the top of your medical class, but you were not admitted 
until the first day of school, and then only after another student dropped out. 
What has this taught you?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I am left from my struggle with a profound sense of what is possible. I 
believe in the benefits of hard work, tenacity and attention to one's ideas. 
I'm completely convinced of the possibilities of being a lifelong learner. 
Whatever your age, never stop learning, reading or analyzing, because we only 
get better. To young children, my struggle says: Early on I was not the best 
student or destined for success, but I never gave up and the people who loved 
me never gave up. I didn't realize my full potential until I was 21 years of 
age, and I would be very sad if someone had turned off my lights, because I 
certainly would not have enjoyed the opportunity to contribute to this society 
as I have today.*

BUS STRIKE SETTLEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Absolute nonsense and even false statements by a columnist may be 
insufficient reasons not to publish it, but I must protest the error-filled, 
foolish column about workers by Eric Mann (Column Left, Aug. 4). 
</P>
<P>
 Mann falsely damned workers at the Metropolitan Transit Authority for a lack 
of unity during the brief strike by mechanics. The truth is, almost no members 
of the Amalgamated Transit Union, which was on strike, crossed the picket 
lines. They had the almost complete support of drivers, clerks and others who 
were not even on strike themselves. That was true labor solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the MTA workers' strike should have been in support of something he 
created and calls the "Bus Riders Union," which he says wanted workers to 
strike in opposition to MTA plans to raise fares instead of reducing them. 
Striking for such an unrealistic goal would have continued to hurt millions of 
low-income transit riders, and, of course, the workers themselves. Fares should 
be lowered, of course, but few workers expect what Mann calls the "class 
struggle" and "naked class interest" should be used to achieve his goals.  
</P>
<P>
 Mann said "the unions could have taken a stand against fare increases." They 
did just that, repeatedly. 
</P>
<P>
 The unions won, not lost, the strike because, among other things, they stopped 
anti-union board members from increasing the use of low-wage workers to replace 
unionized MTA employees. And they stopped -- I hope permanently -- the 
determined effort to break the unions at MTA.

</P>

</P>
<P>
 * Mann condemns the MTA contract settlement as a sellout to "privateers" like 
Foothill Transit. I'd like to set the record straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill Transit is a public/private partnership made up of 20 cities in the 
San Gabriel Valley and Los Angeles County. Foothill Transit began operating in 
1988 when it assumed the operation of 14 struggling bus lines from the RTD -- 
bus lines that were in danger of being eliminated. Those lines have not only 
been continued under Foothill's leadership, many have expanded due to a sharp 
increase in ridership. Foothill now operates 21 lines. Last year, Foothill was 
chosen as the best bus system of its size in North America. Our passenger 
satisfaction rating is extremely high. This could not have been accomplished 
without a corporate business strategy and the hard work of drivers, mechanics 
and management. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Foothill Transit pay its drivers less money than the MTA? Yes. But so 
does every other bus system in Los Angeles County and, for that matter, in 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill Transit is not a "union buster" as Mann would like you to believe. In 
fact, Foothill's 400 drivers and mechanics are all members of the Teamsters 
Union. And, as Foothill continues to expand, more union jobs will be created. 
Foothill has proposed to take over additional lines in the San Gabriel Valley. 
However, we have also suggested that the MTA drivers on those routes be 
transferred to other areas that are currently underserved by the MTA. 
</P>
<P>
 As to the big picture, it is no longer business as usual. Southern California 
mass transit providers must now cope with a double-edged sword: an increasing 
population with decreasing revenues. All entities, both public and private, 
must operate in a more cost-efficient manner if they hope to survive in the 
future. Can this be achieved while, at the same time, employment is preserved 
or expanded? Foothill Transit has proven the answer is a resounding yes.

 * As you point out (Aug. 4), bus riders -- many of whom simply wanted to get 
to their own jobs -- paid a significant price during the strike at the MTA. A 
price was also paid by the strikers in terms of missed wages and MTA management 
in terms of lost public support. There is an alternative to work stoppages when 
labor-management impasses occur. It is called binding arbitration and is used 
in many public jurisdictions, including the U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Arbitration comes in many forms: conventional, final offer, tripartite, etc. 
In all of them a neutral panel or individual is charged with imposing 
settlement terms after hearing evidence from the parties to the dispute. Surely 
one of these variants can be found acceptable and adopted by both sides in time 
for the next negotiations. But arbitration won't happen unless state and local 
political leaders, working with MTA unions and management, push for it.

 * Your article on the MTA bus advertising program (Aug. 8) was a bit naive and 
misleading. I had the misfortune recently of riding on one of these dark, 
traveling "coffins." I could not see out the windows to read street signs and 
felt very claustrophobic. I had to walk up to the front to find out where I was 
and to see anything. As usual, the MTA is trying to make a few cents more by 
torturing the poor and car-less, who have to use their crummy buses.

PAUL FLEISS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Heidi Fleiss, Father Indicted on Tax Charges," July 29: 
</P>
<P>
 I have known Dr. Paul Fleiss for 19 years. He has been our children's 
physician since our oldest daughter was a baby.In every news account, he is 
referred to not only as Heidi Fleiss' father but also as a "prominent and 
wealthy pediatrician." Now, he is also accused of being Heidi's crime partner. 
It is an ironic twist -- the "sins of the children will be visited on the 
parents." How tragic that a human being can lead a life of service and 
dedication only to have his moral character and reputation soiled by innuendoes 
and sensationalism.  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Paul, as everyone calls him, has been in practice for 30 years. During 
this time he has unfailingly helped many, many people regardless of ethnic 
background or economic status. His staff is made of people who have been 
working for him for many years -- some as long as 25 years -- and who are 
devoted to him, his work and his patients. Since the '70s, his office has been 
in the same modest address -- an old, funky house, casual and warm, surrounded 
by happy pictures sent by proud parents, both rich and poor, who think of Dr. 
Paul as family. He has never been too busy or too tired to answer the call of a 
worried parent, no matter how minor the concern, and he always does it with 
graciousness and care. 
</P>
<P>
 Compassion and elegance of spirit describe him. He is beloved and respected. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unfortunate what has happened. He does not deserve any of it.

L.A. FEMALE FIREFIGHTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As chief of the Los Angeles City Fire Department, I wish to commend you for 
the insightful article on female firefighters (Aug. 2). There are certain 
statements concerning our department in your article, however, which conflict 
with our data that need to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal court consent decree of 1974 for the Fire Department addressed 
ethnic minorities without mention of females. The article could lead one to 
believe that our department began recruiting females to avoid being sued. When 
I became chief in 1983, there was no hint of being sued on this matter. 
</P>
<P>
 On becoming chief, one of my first actions was to obtain approval from the 
Board of Fire Commissioners, the mayor and the City Council for a training 
program that focused on enhancing female candidates' physical ability 
potential. We wanted to hire female firefighters because we believed that women 
had every right to be firefighters and could become successful firefighters. 
The only caveat was that female firefighters must, for the safety of their 
fellow workers, meet the same minimum physical standards as their male 
counterparts. To its credit, your article stressed this important factor. In 
emergency situations, lives are at stake and firefighter safety should never be 
compromised. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistic of 53 female firefighters in our department is inaccurate. We 
have 100 female firefighters, including two fire inspectors in the Fire 
Prevention Bureau, three engineers and three captains. With 100 female 
firefighters, we now have 3.2% of our firefighter work force female. This means 
that our department has more female firefighters than any other career fire 
department in the nation, and, in fact, we have 2.5% of the career female 
firefighters in the nation. We are proud of this record and plan to continue 
our successful programs to improve our statistics not only at the entry level, 
but also for career options and enhanced promotability.  
</P>
<P>
 Our 3.2% female representation, in my view, is nowhere near enough, and I am 
pleased that your article stressed in conclusion that it is rare for a female 
firefighter ever to work alongside another female firefighter. We hope to 
change this situation in Los Angeles, and our female tutorial program is the 
primary vehicle to achieve this. This program is alive and well and we have no 
intention of eliminating this program as was mentioned in the article, and are 
unaware of a threatened lawsuit to stop this program. We are convinced that 
this is the best program at our disposal to increase the number of female 
firefighters.

TOWARD A STATE OF DROUGHT; IF CALIFORNIA IS TO AVOID EXTREME PROBLEMS, WATER 
REFORM IS ESSENTIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Because water is a precious commodity in California, state water laws are 
complex and change very slowly. Any change, however minor, is invariably 
preceded by a lot of labored compromising among competing interests. Thus the 
Legislature's recent defeat of a major proposal to change how local governments 
handle water was nothing unusual. But this kind of proposal is bound to come up 
again and again, until some compromise version become law. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure, AB 2673, by Assemblyman Dominic L. Cortese (D-San Jose), would 
have required that cities and counties identify the source and availability of 
water to supply any new developments before they could be built. The measure 
died in committee largely because Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward) decided the issues it raised were too complicated to deal with 
before the Legislature's Aug. 31 adjournment. Lockyer was probably right. But 
Cortese was certainly right to introduce the bill in the first place, and he or 
someone else definitely should revive it in the next legislative session. It is 
an eminently sensible idea -- one that other states use to carefully manage 
growth and water use, but which California has been slow to accept. 
</P>
<P>
 Powerful interests in this state feel they should have first priority when 
water allocation rules are set -- farmers, manufacturers and home builders to 
name just a few. So while farmers, water agencies and even the Sierra Club 
signed off on AB 2673, real estate developers didn't like it and lobbied 
heavily to kill it. 
</P>
<P>
 Some form of this measure will have to be enacted eventually because nature 
and economics demand it. Water is a finite resource in California, especially 
during our periodic droughts. We can no longer afford to build our way out of 
the problem by digging new canals and dams. 
</P>
<P>
 More than three-quarters of California's population now lives in parts of the 
state that are either desert or semidesert. And some scientists warn that our 
recent dry spells may mark the return of prolonged periods of drought in the 
Far West. We can no longer take our water supply for granted. If we do, this 
still-growing state could stumble blindly into a permanent state of water 
crisis.

CALIFORNIA WATCH; FIGHTING BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California is finally fighting back. After seeing every junction with a stop 
light between here and Des Moines trying to pick off local businesses, the 
California Trade and Commerce Agency launched an advertising counteroffensive 
last Tuesday.The message is that, whatever our problems, California is "still 
the Golden State," home to such "native Californians" as the personal computer, 
Zinfandel wine, the skateboard, the fortune cookie, the stealth bomber and blue 
jeans. 
</P>
<P>
 The ads, paid for mainly with about $13 million in private donations from 
major California corporations and advertising companies, are appearing in both 
state and national newspapers and economic-development journals, as well as on 
radio, television and cable outlets. The campaign, organized by several 
advertising agencies led by Kresser/Craig of Santa Monica, is set to run 
through the end of next year and is already making waves by attacking Arizona, 
Nevada and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ads, for example, targets the "tall tales" that Texas is telling 
about California and its "unmerciful mother nature." The ad goes on, with 
provocative rhetoric: "What they don't mention is their own subzero weather, 
alternating with three-shower-a-day humidity. Along with hurricanes, tornadoes, 
floods and mosquitoes that require runways to land." 
</P>
<P>
 An acquaintance of ours from Houston concedes the humidity, hurricanes, 
tornadoes and floods. But he angrily disputes the business about the mosquitoes 
as libelous. What they have in Texas, he says, are cockroaches big enough to 
drive Volkswagens.

CITY HALL REPAIRS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Regarding Los Angeles City Hall seismic work: Your Aug. 5 article states the 
work initially was "pegged at $92 million" and the City Council approved $153.5 
million and doubts that that will be enough! 
</P>
<P>
 I can't believe the city has seismic engineers, structural engineers, building 
inspectors, etc., and these men cannot accurately give out a closed-end 
contract with no ups! 
</P>
<P>
 My dental patients hold me to my estimates; I hold you to the price you quote 
me for my newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems only government units, from the federal on down, can't give a 
contract out that is ironclad! Every contractor underbids so he can get the job 
knowing full well he will increase his fee. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will most likely end up costing us more than it would cost to tear 
it down and rebuild it with the same look. That's what it will end up being 
anyway -- a facade with a whole new interior.

PERSPECTIVE ON THE ECONOMY; START ISSUING U.S. BONDS IN YEN; IT WOULD EASE 
PRESSURES ON THE DOLLAR, REASSURE WORLD MARKETS AND REVIVE JAPANESE INVESTMENT 
IN AMERICA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORBERT WALTER, Norbert Walter is managing director of Deutsche Bank 
Research in Frankfurt, Germany.

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the foreseeable future, the United States will run a sizable 
current-account deficit, while Japan will continue to post an equally large 
current-account surplus. Forecasts for the respective balances are in the range 
of $120 billion to $130 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to the imbalance in domestic savings rates, there is a need for a 
significant flow of Japanese savings into U.S. coffers. However, as a 
consequence of the phenomenal strengthening of the yen against the dollar in 
recent years, Japanese investors in dollar-denominated assets already feel 
badly burned. The value of these assets has eroded in a spectacular fashion. 
Some observers estimate their losses to be in the range of $300 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Under these circumstances, it is quite unlikely that Japanese investors will 
be keen on re-entering the market to buy U.S. assets with dollars in a 
significant volume. 
</P>
<P>
 This leads us to a conclusion discomfiting for all major economies: The dollar 
would become even weaker and, in order to defend its eroding currency, the 
United States would have to raise interest rates significantly above the levels 
indicated by conditions in the domestic economy. Its current upswing would be 
an obvious victim along the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's domestic economic problems would also worsen. Over the past year and a 
half, the country has -- for the first time in its postwar history -- seen 
domestic production capacity lie fallow. In the process, an outright culture 
shock has hit Japan. It has had to cope with the unwelcome fact that the 
bureaucrats have proved themselves incapable of managing the economy according 
to plan. In addition, the resulting shift toward investment outside of Japan 
will do little to stimulate the opening up of the country's domestic economy. 
</P>
<P>
 What can be done in the light of these circumstances? One constructive step 
would be if the U.S. Treasury, or at least some government agency, began to 
issue yen-denominated paper (bonds whose value is in yen rather than dollars). 
This approach would have several advantages. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the markets have been telling the U.S. government -- despite its 
reasonable assurances -- that they are not certain whether the Clinton 
Administration can be relied upon not to use the exchange rate as a tool to 
promote U.S. competitiveness. Right or wrong, as long as that perception is out 
there, the politicians in Washington are forced to deal with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Issuing yen-denominated U.S. Treasury bonds would provide crucial comfort to 
Japanese institutional investors. With new bond assets denominated in the yen, 
they would no longer have to assume the exchange-rate risk. It would therefore 
go a long way toward enticing the Japanese to once again recycle their trade 
surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 But more important, it represents a very potent tool to convince the markets 
of the credibility of the Clinton Administration's intentions. By taking this 
step, it would show itself prepared to put its money where its mouth is. By 
using a foreign currency to fund part of its debt, the U.S. government 
effectively assumes the exchange-rate risk on such debt. In other words, it 
would stand to lose if the dollar went down even further. Under this scenario, 
it would get fewer yen for the dollars it budgeted to service that debt and 
would thus be forced to spend more dollars than planned. 
</P>
<P>
 While this may sound dangerous at first sight, the downside risk is very much 
worth taking. Aside from eliminating the nagging doubts about the real 
intentions of the Administration, these yen-denominated Treasury instruments 
could be issued at interest rates below current U.S. levels. Given the lower 
level of interest rates prevailing in Japan, they would still be very 
attractive to investors in the yen zone. Obviously, this would also help reduce 
the potential costs of the exchange rate risk mentioned above. 
</P>
<P>
 What should be the size of such yen-denominated U.S. public debt? While 
obviously limited in scope initially, this kind of funding could eventually be 
as high as the Japanese share of the U.S. current account deficit. That amounts 
to roughly $70 billion, which coincidentally is equal to one-third of the 
federal budget deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should I, a European, be concerned about all this? First, none of the 
world's major industrialized economies benefits from wild swings in exchange 
rates. Second, we Europeans have worked hard at home to bring about 
exchange-rate stability. Against much skepticism in the markets, and due to an 
ever-increasing degree of coordination in economic and fiscal policy as well as 
a result of greater trade integration, we are reaping the benefits of such 
stability within the European Monetary System. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there always is a danger that this delicate balance may be upset, 
primarily due to extraneous circumstances (for instance, great volatility in 
the dollar-yen exchange rate.). Such cross-rate pressures may well have 
significant spillover effects on European currencies, thus upsetting the 
balance established within the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet there is an even more important issue. Europe currently finds itself the 
bystander in what it considers to be an unproductive fight on trade issues 
between the United States, the world's sole remaining superpower, and Japan, a 
country without much of a functioning government and therefore in some 
disarray. This dispute leaves the world financial system vulnerable. If we were 
to see domino effects, for example as a result of overleveraged Japanese firms 
collapsing due to an excessive use of the exchange-rate weapon and a 
potentially unaware lender of last resort (the Japanese government), the world 
financial markets might be at risk.

COLUMN RIGHT / DENNIS PRAGER: OUR FATHER FIGURE WHO ART IN HEAVEN; FEMINISTS 
WHO ARGUE FOR A GENDER-NEUTRAL BIBLE SHOULD STOP TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS PRAGER, Dennis Prager writes Ultimate Issues, a quarterly journal on 
Judaism and society. He is a talk show host on KABC in Los Angeles and WABC in 
New York.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A recent Presbyterian conference on "re-imagining God" as a female deity has 
made apparent once again that many Christians and Jews are having a difficult 
time with the traditional masculine depictions of God. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason for this difficulty is the widespread belief that the only reason 
the Bible refers to God in the masculine is the patriarchy and sexism of the 
ancient world. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true that the Bible is written within a patriarchal context and that 
there is sexism in Bible-based religions. But these facts alone do not explain 
why God is depicted as a "father" rather than as a "parent" or "mother." 
</P>
<P>
 The depiction of God in masculine terms is, in fact, essential to the 
fundamental moral purposes of the Bible and Judeo-Christian society. 
</P>
<P>
 If you consider that the Bible's primary concern is moral behavior and that 
most perpetrators of violence against innocent people are males, several 
reasons for depicting God as a father suggest themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 * Boys take rules from men. When they are young, males need to feel 
accountable to a male authority figure. Without a father or some other male 
rule-giver, young men are likely to do great harm. Many mothers will tell you 
that if there is no male authority figure to give a boy rules, it is virtually 
impossible for her to control his wilder impulses. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, a God depicted in masculine terms -- not a goddess, not a 
"Mother in heaven" -- must be the source of "Thou shall not murder," "Thou 
shall not steal," etc. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who feel discriminated against because of the male depiction of God need 
to ask themselves whether any discomfort they may feel because of a masculine 
depiction of God is comparable to the pain they will suffer if boys are not 
civilized into good men. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who do not acknowledge the need for male moral authority only have to 
study the criminal population in the United States in the late 20th Century. 
They will find that, more than any other factor, the absence of a father or 
other male authority figure in the formative years of boy's life contributes to 
criminal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 If the father-figure/rule-giver that boys need is not on Earth, a loving and 
morally authoritative father in heaven can often serve as an effective 
substitute.  
</P>
<P>
 * Males need a male role model. In order to transform a wild boy into a good 
man, a male role model is as necessary as a male rule-giver. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bible depicts God as merciful, caring for the helpless and a lover of 
justice, it is not so much interested in describing God who is, after all, 
largely indescribable but in providing a model for human emulation. 
</P>
<P>
 If God were a female, boys and men would deem these beautiful traits as 
"feminine," and therefore, in their pursuit of their masculinity, reject them. 
</P>
<P>
 But if God -- our father in heaven who is on occasion a warrior -- cares for 
the poor and loves justice, mercy and kindness, then these traits are 
masculine, and to be emulated. 
</P>
<P>
 The argument that this is sexist, since girls need moral female models, is 
irrelevant and untrue. The problem of violence is a male one -- and one the 
Bible is most concerned with -- and girls are able to retain their femininity 
and their decency with a male-depicted God. Of course, girls need female role 
models -- but not in order to avoid violence. 
</P>
<P>
 * The male is more rule-oriented. Law and order are not code words for 
repression, but rather the essential building blocks of a decent society. It 
is, therefore, natural and desirable that God will be identified with the 
gender that is more naturally disposed to rules and justice -- males. Females 
are more naturally inclined toward feelings and compassion -- essential 
qualities for a decent personal life, but not for the governance of society. 
</P>
<P>
 A final, personal note: I am a strong supporter of women's equality; my own 
religious life is egalitarian; I fully acknowledge that God is neither male nor 
female, and I regard the notion that either sex is superior as nonsense. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, I find it ironic that some women in the name of feminism, are attempting 
to emasculate the God of Western religious morality. If their goal is achieved, 
it is women who will suffer most from lawless males.  
</P>
<P>
 We have too many absent fathers on Earth to begin to even entertain the 
thought of having no father in heaven.

WHEN INNOCENCE DIED AND MARKETING SET IN; WOODSTOCK: THE ANARCHIC CELEBRATION 
PROVED THE SIZE OF THE NEW YOUTH AUDIENCE AND CORPORATE ROCK WAS BORN. 
</P>

 I remember Woodstock. And, true to the joke that if you remember Woodstock you 
weren't there, I wasn't. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, I was 13 and living in England. We moved to America in '71 and I 
discovered rock 'n' roll in the echo of Woodstock. Woodstock was a state of 
being for me rather than an event, something usefully surreal rather than 
actually real. It validated how we young people saw ourselves. It was our 
Appomattox, where the "Father Knows Best" generation surrendered to its youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodstock was also the alpha and omega of rock 'n' roll: the simultaneous 
death of its innocence and the birth of the corporate rock era. Hundreds of 
thousands of people overwhelming the few, thin vestiges of order -- ticket 
prices, fences, crowd control, highway patrolmen -- demonstrated that rock 'n' 
roll was huge business, much larger than anyone had realized. Woodstock was 
triumphant anarchy, benign as it turned out, but anarchy nonetheless. And if 
business could just bottle that . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And bottle it they did. "They" being the record industry, whose breadwinners 
at the time were as much Frank Sinatra and Andy Williams as the Beatles and 
Rolling Stones. Rock 'n' roll, huge only to its constituency, was equivalent 
then to the alternative music of two years ago. But Woodstock changed all that, 
rapidly. Kids became not the enemy but the market. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1969, FM radio was virtually underground. Innovative rock 'n' roll found a 
welcome there and settled into its new, and to begin with barren, homeland. In 
'71, FM radio was still fresh, experimental, gushingly enthusiastic, naive and 
fantastic. Every day, FM radio ran out of hours, not music. I'm not talking 
about today's classic rock, which is virtually just reheated AM radio, the silt 
of a great musical era. I'm talking about a spirit of musical diversity that 
was doomed as soon as the culture's commercial value could be accurately 
ascertained. Because once radio stations became hot properties, they sold for 
ever larger prices, and their owners became proportionately conservative to the 
size of their debts. 
</P>
<P>
 I used to listen to Allison Steele on WNEW, New York's legendary pioneer FM 
station. She called herself the "Night Bird." She came on at midnight, read a 
different poem every night and talked for the first 15 minutes of her show 
before she played her first song. The mystical Zac on rival WPLJ was radio's 
Merlin, and WNEW's Jonathan Schwartz was FM's preeminent philosopher. In L.A., 
it was KMET that played the same pioneering music and shaped pop culture. The 
early DJs were passionate and as wide-eyed as their invisible audiences about 
this new music and unfolding society. Once, I tuned into Schwartz's show as he 
was asking listeners to tell him whether he should play Sinatra along with, 
say, King Crimson. The listeners voted yes. It was all that open then. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodstock died at Woodstock, just as the spark disappears with the ignition. 
Woodstock '94 is a form of virtual reality -- a harmless, musical Jurassic 
Park. The music may or may not be good, or worth the $135 that the tickets 
cost, but the vibes are synthetic, the echo a licensed sample. Woodstock in '69 
was a unique, unrepeatable moment. It was spontaneous and organic. Its 
significance came from a generation discovering its own voice, though that 
ephemeral weekend was also the last time that generation was the sole owner of 
its own voice: Big business quickly bought in. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not cynical about Woodstock '94, and I'm no more sentimental about times 
gone by than I am about, say, my sixth birthday. But overlooked in the 
generational dispute about the meaningfulness of the original Woodstock is the 
fact that it was the biggest happy accident in history. There's no sequel to 
that.

THE STATE; THE LAZY POLITICIAN'S WAY TO WIN: EMBRACE VIRTUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Virtue, they say, is its own reward. But California politicians think 
differently. They see the "politics of virtue" as a ticket to victory in 
November. And if they are right, grumble professional cynics, the politics of 
virtue will play everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the politics of virtue? Virtue implies a certain moral excellence; it 
encompasses "good traits" of character -- "honesty," "compassion," "courage" 
and "perseverance" are among those listed in William J. Bennett's best seller, 
"The Book of Virtues." 
</P>
<P>
 The cultivation of virtue makes for good individuals, exemplary parents, 
responsible citizens and trusted leaders. All are necessary for a society to 
function well. "And," as a recent Newsweek story explained, "without a virtuous 
society, individuals cannot realize either their own or the common good. That, 
in theory, is what the 'politics of virtue' is all about." 
</P>
<P>
 In practice, value politics is also about winning. Recent polls indicate an 
upsurge in voter concern over the breakdown of moral and family values. That's 
why California candidates across the political spectrum are hustling to 
position themselves as "Virtuecrats" -- Newsweek's label for practitioners of 
value politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans who have long railed against the excesses of Big Government now 
look to it to lead the virtue crusade through laws that set morals and 
standards. Assemblyman Mickey R. Conroy's (R-Orange) bill to mandate flogging 
as a punishment for graffiti is an example. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats, once overflowing with social activism, are passing budgets that cut 
government programs dear to their traditional constituencies. And many have 
joined Republicans in embracing the "character-building" aspects of tough, 
anti-crime legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in his tenure, Gov. Pete Wilson embraced the idea of "preventive 
government," which centered on pro-active social and educational programs. But 
the costs of prevention proved too high. Wilson has since promoted government 
programs that guarantee swift and certain punishment for defying society's 
rules and norms. They form the foundation of his reelection campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Kathleen Brown embraced the politics of virtue when she made her family's 
legacy a campaign theme, and again when she sought to link her opposition to 
the death penalty to family and religious values. Recently, Brown added another 
virtue-politics campaign slogan: "Restore the promise for California families." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Mike Huffington has rooted his bid for the U.S. Senate in the politics of 
virtue. One of his first TV spots was a paean to Bennett's book, which 
Huffington extolled as "a great reminder that solving problems in our country 
depends on strong individuals and strong families, not on government." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington has proposed legislation to expand tax deductions for charitable 
contributions and touts volunteerism as the way to "turn the country around" 
and "get rid of the welfare state." His pitch appears to be resonating with 
California voters. And Republicans elsewhere are sensing an effective line of 
attack against incumbent Democrats -- tar them with failed, big-ticket social 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Aware that Huffington's "virtue" message is working, Sen. Dianne Feinstein has 
come on strong in favor of "values" issues like crime control and immigration 
reform. She has proposed legislation to mandate a year's expulsion for students 
caught with guns on school property. 
</P>
<P>
 As close to goodness as Virtuecrats would like to position themselves, there 
is a dark side to their politics. They have driven another wedge between the 
two Californias, one older, Anglo, conservative, anti-government, anti-tax and 
more likely to vote; the other younger, more likely minority, less likely to 
vote and more in need of government programs. Frequently, the latter California 
appears to be the target of the politics of virtue. 
</P>
<P>
 The hard-line stands many California politicians have taken on crime, 
immigration and welfare can be viewed as means toward an orderly and civil 
society. But they can also be viewed as shortsighted fear-mongering by 
candidates who pander to swing voters at the expense of the poor and 
minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Virtuecrats' call for volunteerism and private charities to assume the 
social-welfare tasks of government reeks of noblesse oblige. But it also 
promises an angry middle class that taxpayers can choose when, where and 
whether their money will be spent. Certainly, it is virtuous for the less 
fortunate to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps, but it's even more 
appealing to voters if taxpayers aren't stuck with the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often, the politics of virtue comes down to touting values with a wink and 
a nod. In the 1992 California elections, GOP right-wing candidates lost 
marginal legislative and congressional districts to moderate, pro-business 
Democrats. By substituting the kinder, gentler language of family values and 
character education for the harsh rhetoric of the religious right, the politics 
of virtue allows Republicans to attract moderate voters without alienating 
their conservative base. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Democrats, they seek to use the spirituality of the politics of virtue 
in an attempt to inoculate themselves against GOP attacks on character issues. 
Calls for tough and sure punishment for society's criminals, tempered by 
support for preventive programs for disadvantaged youth, enable Democrats to 
undermine the GOP's domination of the crime issue without alienating their 
liberal base. 
</P>
<P>
 The politics of virtue, then, offers an easy way to avoid hard political 
choices. Money saved by axing high-priced social-welfare programs can be used 
to help offset the costs of crime control and building prisons. Voters might 
like that. But relying on the vagaries of volunteerism and private charity puts 
at risk the quality of life for all Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 If the politics of virtue sell this November, California might find itself 
becoming more and more like Charles Dickens' England and less like the Golden 
State it once aspired to be.*

THEATER NOTES; LATINO LAB LOOKING TO LEAVE TAPER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Don Shirley 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jose Luis Valenzuela wants to move his Latino Theatre Lab from the Mark Taper 
Forum to Plaza de la Raza, the cultural center in East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 Launched at the Los Angeles Theatre Center with the help of $250,000 from the 
Ford Foundation in 1987-88, the lab moved to the Taper after the LATC resident 
company collapsed in 1991. A year later, Valenzuela became the director of the 
Taper's Latino Theatre Initiative, which was financed with a $1.4-million grant 
from the Lila Wallace/Reader's Digest Fund. Valenzuela recently directed 
"Bandido!" at the Taper as part of the Initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 But no Latino Lab production was scheduled for next season at the Taper, where 
many types of plays vie for the mainstage slots. "There are things I want to 
move forward, but the complexity of the Taper makes those things difficult to 
accomplish," Valenzuela said. "I would have been at the Taper two more years 
without doing anything (on the mainstage). I'd be bored." 
</P>
<P>
 So Valenzuela has decided to try to build his own institution. Enter Plaza de 
la Raza, home of a 240-seat theater "in the middle of the Chicano community," 
to use Valenzuela's words. He presented a five-year plan to the organization's 
board of directors, and "the idea intrigues them," said Plaza interim managing 
director Lydia Lopez. "We'd love to have him here" -- but the board probably 
won't decide if it's feasible until later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Money, of course, would be required. Valenzuela not only wants to present 
annual seasons of Latino plays using actors on an Actors' Equity contract, 
starting in 1995-96, but he also wants to expand the seating in the theater to 
a 350-400-seat capacity. He hopes that a university may want to become a 
partner in the project. He also plans to call on "all my connections" in 
foundations and corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela staged "The Last Angry Brown Hat" at Plaza de la Raza in 1993, in a 
production that cost a mere $350 and ended up making a little money, he said. 
He believes audiences will come to that theater. But that play (currently being 
revived by Actors Alley with most of the same cast) was presented under 
Equity's 99-Seat Theater Plan, which requires only token payments to actors and 
restricts the size of audiences to 99. 
</P>
<P>
 Audiences did come to "Bandido!" at the Taper, despite a largely negative 
response from critics. It grossed more at the box office than any other 
mainstage production last year, Taper officials said. Valenzuela said that he 
was proud of the production, "but I don't think we finished it. We needed more 
time, maybe one more workshop, to make it as successful as it could be." Some 
day, perhaps, he'll have a chance to tackle "Bandido!" again at Plaza de la 
Raza.

 With Valenzuela on his way out, who will run the Latino Theatre Initiative at 
the Taper? Rosamaria Marquez has been promoted to a full-time administrator job 
on the project, but the search for an artistic director is still going on. The 
Initiative calls for one Latino play each season on the mainstage; next season 
it will be Eduardo Machado's "Floating Islands," opening in October, to be 
directed by Oskar Eustis. The Latino Lab's work has generally focused on 
Chicano subjects, so Machado's Cuban American epic could represent a broader 
focus for the Initiative. Then again, said Corey Beth Madden -- the Taper 
official overseeing the search for the Initiative's artistic director until one 
is appointed -- "I can't say what direction we'll go in."

 SAN DIEGO WATCH: The Theatre Corp. of America's retreat from the Alex Theatre 
in Glendale last week was preceded a week earlier by its exit from its only 
other remaining outlet outside its home base in Pasadena, the Poway Center for 
the Performing Arts in San Diego County. Last week the Poway city council 
quickly approved a plan of substitute programming for its 850-seat theater. JRS 
Productions will present "Plaza Suite" with Lee Meriwether, Oct. 27-Nov. 6, and 
Robert Mandan in "Sleuth," Jan. 12-22. Then Glendale's acclaimed classical 
company, A Noise Within, will revive its recent "Importance of Being Earnest" 
for a May 4-14 run. The city is supporting the series with a loan guarantee of 
$100,000, although it's still owed $42,000 by the departing Theatre Corp., 
according to City Manager Jim Bowersox. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year in downtown San Diego, the Theatre Corp. had been bringing 
shows to the Spreckels Theatre, where it honored subscriptions of the Starlight 
Musical Theatre, the 48-year-old Balboa Park institution that appeared to be 
fading away. But now that Theatre Corp. has left town, Starlight has 
unexpectedly put together a 49th season, though it's on a shoestring $300,000 
budget (down $1 million from previous budgets) and probably won't use any 
members of Actors' Equity. Already open is "A Funny Thing Happened on the Way 
to the Forum." It will be followed by "Hair," most of it imported from 
Riverside Civic Light Opera (Aug. 31-Sept. 4), and a new musical based on a 
1945 movie, "Enchanted Cottage" (Sept. 21-25), from Bakersfield Civic Light 
Opera. The latter, about a romance between a disfigured veteran and a plain 
woman, features lyrics by Martha Davis, former lead singer for the Motels.

 MAROWITZ IN TEXAS: Los Angeles director and critic Charles Marowitz is the 
artistic director of Texas Stage, a new classical company in Ft. Worth. 
Starting in September, he plans a three-play season in a 220-seat theater 
called the Caravan of Dreams: his own "Shrew" (based on Shakespeare's), "The 
Importance of Being Earnest" ("very different" from the one he staged at Los 
Angeles Theatre Center) and Shaw's "The Admirable Bashville." The acting 
company includes seven members of Actors' Equity, five of whom are from Los 
Angeles. The Bass Foundation and other Ft. Worth donors are providing 
financing.*

MUSIC / DANCE NEWS: MUSIC GUILD: 50 YEARS OLD AND GROWING; THE CHAMBER-MUSIC 
PRESENTER WILL OFFER 24 CONCERTS IN '94-95. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Music Guild -- 50 years old and a bastion of conservative chamber music -- 
seems to be experiencing unprecedented growth these days, even in this era of 
progressive belt-tightening in the arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Expansion seems to be Music Guild's pattern in the 1990s. The chamber-music 
presenter, over the decades having sponsored visits by most of the famous 
groups in the field, including I Musici, the Guarneri and Juilliard Quartets, 
the Beaux Arts Trio and the Bach Aria Group, has added venues nearly every 
season, and its subscription lists have doubled at its home auditorium, 
Wilshire-Ebell Theatre, from a low point in 1985 of some 500 to its present 
membership of nearly 1,100. In 1985, when the organization began its growth 
spurt, its concerts totaled five; in 1994-95, it will present 24 concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, the presenter expanded to Pierce College in Woodland Hills, and in 
1993 to Cal State Long Beach. And now, at the start of Music Guild's 50th 
anniversary season, manager Eugene Golden announces more growth: Beginning in 
October, one-hour youth concerts will be given at Cienega Elementary School in 
the central city. 
</P>
<P>
 F ounded in the mid-1940s by radio personality and record- shop owner Alfred 
Leonard -- he of the distinctive Austrian accent -- Music Guild for half a 
century has presented touring chamber ensembles from mostly European and North 
American sources -- the famous quartets, trios and duos of international fame. 
In recent years, Golden has arranged for guest appearances by resident artists 
with some of the visiting groups; this innovation, along with regular infusions 
of music by living composers on Music Guild programs, has been successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our programming will always be conservative," Golden acknowledges, "but we 
are not out of touch (with the present)." 
</P>
<P>
 The six ensembles that will appear at the Wilshire-Ebell will also each play a 
daytime concert at the school as part of the new series.  
</P>
<P>
 Along with the Ebell concerts on Wednesdays, the groups will play at Cal State 
Long Beach on Mondays and Pierce College in Woodland Hills on Tuesdays. During 
the week they appear at the Wilshire-Ebell. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that Music Guild's expansion, including the burgeoning of 
Ebell subscribers, has been accomplished without -- as Golden's predecessor, 
the late Dorothy Huttenback, used to point out proudly -- government grants or 
foundation support. Huttenback was also suspicious of relying on large donors 
with hidden agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 From a budget of $38,400 in 1984, the organization has increased its spending 
to $102,000 for 1994-95. But, Golden says, the loyal subscribers are getting 
one more concert per season at a price increase of just $1 per event. 
Subscriptions to the Long Beach and Woodland Hills series (each in a hall 
holding around 300 listeners) cost $84 for six concerts; in the larger 
1,200-seat Wilshire-Ebell, that cost is tiered from $78 down to $54. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ebell season begins Oct. 27 with an appearance by the Audubon String 
Quartet with pianist Mona Golabek, and continues Nov. 30 when the Orion String 
Quartet hosts violist Heiichiro Ohyama. The Borromeo Quartet "and Friends" open 
the new year at the mid-Wilshire hall Jan. 18, followed by the Raphael Piano 
Trio Feb. 15, and the American String Quartet, with guests Brian Denbow (viola) 
and Stephen Erdody (cello), March 15. Closing the season is the Ysaye String 
Quartet, with guest pianist Ayke Agus, April 12. 
</P>
<P>
 PRESTO: Dancer-choreographer Bill T. Jones, recent awardee of a MacArthur 
Foundation grant and a 1991 recipient of the $25,000 Dorothy B. Chandler 
Performing Arts award locally, will complete his latest work, "Still/Here," 
while in residence at the Wexner Center for the Arts at Ohio State University 
in Columbus. With his Bill T. Jones/Arnie Zane dance company, Jones will 
showcase the new piece in a series of workshop performances during the next two 
weeks. The company performs at UCLA next April 28-29, the repertory has not yet 
been announced. . . . Based on diaries of Richard Wagner, a new radio drama, 
"Pilgrimage to Beethoven," with Edward Asner and Arye Gross, among others, will 
be broadcast on KCRW (89.9) Aug. 27 at 6:30 p.m. The hourlong drama has been 
adapted by Bernard da Costa and is directed by Christine Bernard-Sugy. . . . A 
sextet of players from the Los Angeles-based ensemble Pacific Serenades will 
make its New York debut Sept. 24 in the Weill Recital Hall at Carnegie Hall. 
The players are clarinetist Gary Gray, violinists Roger Wilkie and Connie 
Kupka, violist Roland Kato, cellist David Speltz and pianist Ayke Agus. They 
will play works by Brahms, Robert Aldridge and Mark Carlson.

ART NOTES: SUIT FAILS BUT CODEX HAMMER STILL FOR SALE; NOVEMBER AUCTION IS 
STILL PLANNED DESPITE JUDGE'S DISMISSAL OF A $400-MILLION CLAIM BY THE NIECE OF 
ARMAND HAMMER'S LATE WIFE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A court action that might have been expected to stop the sale of one of the 
UCLA/Ar mand Hammer Museum of Art and Cultural Center's most valuable assets -- 
an illustrated scientific manuscript by Leonardo da Vinci -- has had no such 
effect. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the lawsuit that prompted the museum to put the Italian Renaissance 
master's manuscript up for auction has been dismissed, UCLA/Hammer officials 
say that the sale will go forward on Nov. 11 at Christie's New York, as 
planned. Proceeds from the auction -- which is expected to yield up to $10 
million -- will go to a reserve fund that may be needed to pay off other legal 
obligations, according to UCLA/Hammer Director Henry T. Hopkins. Any remaining 
money will be used to purchase other artworks, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The manuscript is a 72-page compilation of scientific notes and sketches, 
which is second only in value to the museum's Vincent van Gogh painting, 
"Hospital at Saint-Remy." Long known as the Codex Leicester, the document was 
renamed the Codex Hammer in 1980 when the late chairman of Occidental Petroleum 
Corp. bought it for $5.1 million with funds provided by Occidental. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about the propriety of the Leonardo sale arose in the press in June, 
when the auction was announced. According to standard practices -- spelled out 
in the American Assn. of Museums' Code of Ethics for Museums -- proceeds from 
the sale of artworks in museums' collections should not be used "for anything 
other than acquisition or direct care of collections." The manuscript was 
slated for sale to establish a reserve fund as a hedge against a $400-million 
claim by Joan Weiss, the niece of Armand Hammer's late wife, which sought half 
of the oil tycoon's estate, including his art collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Henry W. Shatford on Aug. 3 dismissed 
the lawsuit, saying that no evidence supports Weiss' claim that Hammer had 
cheated his wife out of her fair share of community property.  
</P>
<P>
 Asked why a $10-million reserve fund is needed now that the Weiss claim has 
been invalidated, Hopkins said: "I can't comment except to say that the suit 
may be appealed and other legal matters are pending." Selling a single 
high-priced item will assure that the museum's collections of European 
paintings and works by French satirist Honore Daumier will remain intact, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Leonardo manuscript is said to be of greater significance as a scientific 
document than as an artwork. In announcing the auction, the UCLA/Hammer Museum 
released a statement, saying, "While the Codex Hammer is an exceedingly 
important and rare document, the sale of this manuscript would least impact the 
core aesthetic identity of the Armand Hammer collections." 
</P>
<P>
 Funds raised from the Leonardo auction will be held in escrow and accrue 
interest for a period of eight years, in accordance with an operating agreement 
between the university and the museum. The agreement stipulates that, after 
eight years, income from the fund may be used for temporary exhibitions and 
other purposes at the discretion of the museum's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Code of Ethics for Museums, which functions as a moral code rather than a 
legal obligation, does not specify how interest accrued from art sales should 
be used. However, Hopkins said if he is still at the museum when money from the 
reserve fund becomes available, he will abide by the code and insist that all 
monies realized from art sales be put into the collection. 
</P>
<P>
 MUCH ADO ABOUT FLUXUS: "In the Spirit of Fluxus," a critically acclaimed 
international traveling show that celebrates an experimental art movement of 
the 1960s, has finally made its way to Southern California. The Santa Barbara 
Museum of Art will host the unorthodox exhibition, plus a suitably eclectic 
slate of related events, next Sunday to Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 A relatively obscure movement that picked up where Dada left off, Fluxus was 
dedicated to merging art with everyday life, and to finding alternatives to 
elite systems for creating and distributing art. The exhibition, organized by 
the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, includes more than 1,000 works including 
performance relics, books, posters, films and full-scale reconstructions of 
Fluxus environments. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a fun house," SBMA curator Diana du Pont said of the extravaganza. 
"There's something for everyone, and it's very accessible." Inviting audience 
participation, the show features such user-friendly items as Yoshimasa Wada's 
"What's the Matter With Your Ear," an interactive, computer-driven orchestra 
with household appliances as musical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "One piece I adore is the self-appointed head of Fluxus, George Maciunas' 
collection and formal arrangement of all the cartons and containers of everyday 
things that he used for a year -- from cereal boxes to nasal inhalers," Du Pont 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Confessing to being "totally in wonder" when she first saw the show in 
Minneapolis, Du Pont said she hopes that the SBMA presentation "will rekindle 
the hidden joy in adults." As part of an ambitious effort to bring the show to 
Santa Barbara and organize related events, she enlisted the support of 
television comedy producer Tom Patchett, a major Fluxus collector who has 
donated funds and loaned many pieces to the show. Other support came from the 
National Endowment for the Arts and the museum's Women's Board and Friends of 
Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
 A free public program -- "FLUXFun for Everyone," featuring street theater, 
music and performance art -- will launch the show next Sunday from 2-4 p.m. 
Additional events include a performance and Q&A with conceptual artist Yoko Ono 
on Sept. 9, a discussion with artist Allan Kaprow on Oct. 8 and a grand finale 
picnic and concert on Oct. 15. For information, call FLUXFONE: (805) 963-4364, 
Ext. 700.

 AUCTION HOUSE SHUFFLE: Gearing up for the fall season, local branches of major 
auction houses have made a batch of new appointments. Hannah Shore, head of 
Christie's Beverly Hills operation, is moving to New York to coordinate the 
firm's 19 regional offices. Her successor is Neal Meltzer, formerly a 
contemporary art specialist and business getter at Christie's New York office. 
Grace Russak is leaving her position as Butterfield and Butterfield's trust and 
estates representative in Los Angeles for a similar position at Christie's 
Beverly Hills. Laura Nagle, head of Butterfield and Butterfield's prints 
department, is joining Sotheby's to work with the firm's Los Angeles print 
sales. In other moves at Sotheby's Beverly Hills office, Victoria Edwards has 
been promoted to senior manager of the print department and Laura Maslon has 
taken charge of public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 KUDOS TO BEA: The Museum of Contemporary Art has launched a program to honor 
Southern California women in the arts. The first winner of the MOCA Award to 
Distinguished Women in the Arts is Beatrice Gersh, a contemporary art collector 
and patron who has served as a MOCA trustee since 1981. She will receive her 
award on Sept. 28. *

POP EYE: FIRST BROTHER'S FIRST ALBUM FINALLY READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Has it seemed kinda quiet lately on the Roger Clinton-as-pop star front? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, it won't be for long. 
</P>
<P>
 His long-promised album, now titled "Nothing Good Comes Easy," will be 
released on Sept. 20 by Miami-based Pyramid Records, whose roster also includes 
the current edition of the Band and Dave Edmunds. 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton's not going to be shy about promoting the new collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got him booked on television heavily -- every major talk show and some 
not-major ones," says Allen Jacobi, chief operating officer of Pyramid. "And 
we'll be sending him around to radio stations and there'll be an advertising 
blitz." 
</P>
<P>
 That will be followed by a national concert tour, with hopes of hitching on as 
an opening act for an established pop performer. 
</P>
<P>
 The expectations? 
</P>
<P>
 "The album's either going to be huge . . . or not very sterling," says Jacobi. 
"I don't think it's going to be in between. Either we're going to capture 
America's imagination, and hopefully hearts, or we're not." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Barnes, editor of the music industry trade paper Radio & Records, is 
placing his bets on the latter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a long, uphill road, isn't it?" says Barnes. "He has to go into it 
expecting a lot of ridicule, and I'm sure he is. It's going to take very strong 
material and brilliant performance." 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine by Clinton, 38, who says he relishes the challenge ahead of him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you're launching yourself into something it's an uphill battle," he 
says. "I do better in uphill battles. If it's downhill, I get complacent and 
lazy."  
</P>
<P>
 Can Clinton possibly overcome inevitable charges that he only got the record 
deal because of who his brother is (he's the President), and memories of such 
infamous White House-related ventures as Billy Beer and Ron Reagan's ballet 
career? 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes there's nothing you can do to please anyone," Clinton says. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobi says the theme of the promotional campaign will be "Hearing is 
believing," and he hopes to keep the focus on the music, not on Clinton's 
relations. The album was produced by Pyramid President Scott Maclellan, with 
backing by the famed Muscle Shoals rhythm section. Clinton co-wrote two songs, 
including the title track, though the first single, "Fantasy of Love," is a 
romantic ballad written by Mike Pinera (formerly of Blues Image and Iron 
Butterfly) and Dwayne Hitchings.  
</P>
<P>
 One notable figure not on the album is a certain saxophone player who lives in 
a big white house on Pennsylvania Avenue. Clinton says that he did want to have 
his brother guest on the record, but he learned a civics lesson in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was pretty new at this First Brother thing and the whole ethical issues," 
he says. "It's something that would be quite normal for two brothers to do, but 
unfortunately when one's the President it can't happen if there might be any 
financial gain in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, the older Clinton's popularity is not so hot right now. Could a hit 
single by his little bro help boost his image? 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing would make me happier," says the younger Clinton. "That'd be a real 
nice twist on things. I'm doing the best I can, and hopefully that in itself 
will help all of our causes." Steve Hochman

 One new Prince album isn't enough? Another is on the way, right on the heels 
of the new Warner Bros.-released "Come" (see Record Rack, Page 56). 
Technically, the next album, which could be in stores next month, won't be by 
Prince since it's all new material recorded since he got into that symbol 
business. It's uncertain what label will release the collection, though 
expectations are for it to come out on his own NPG label, which released "The 
Beautiful Experience" EP recently. Under his agreement with Warner Bros., he 
can also release records on NPG. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Estefan is moving back to pop from her recent Latin music forays for 
her next album, a collection of wide-ranging tunes, including Neil Sedaka's 
"Breaking Up Is Hard to Do" and Blood, Sweat & Tears' "You've Made Me So Very 
Happy." Don't look for a tour, though, since she's expecting a baby in 
December. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 November is looking like a good month for new rap releases, with old-school 
survivor LL Cool J finishing up a new effort scheduled for release by 
Thanksgiving, and new-school stars Onyx due with their second album around the 
same time. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Snow, the Canadian bad boy of dancehall reggae whose fast-start career was 
hampered by parole restrictions stemming from assault convictions, is back with 
a second album, now due in November after being delayed by several legal 
problems. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Recent fans of UB40 can catch up with the early sounds of the English 
reggae-rock band on "Live," an album recorded on a 1982 tour of Ireland, due 
Aug. 23. . . . Steve Albini, probably best known for producing Nirvana's "In 
Utero," has his own new band, Shellac, with an album due from Chicago's Touch 
and Go Records on Aug. 29. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian blues-rocker Jeff Healey makes a side trip to honor some of his 
favorites with an album due Oct. 25. Among the selections are the Beatles' "Yer 
Blues," Muddy Waters' "I'm Ready," Neil Young's "The Loner" and two Jimi 
Hendrix songs: "Freedom" and "Angel." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Expose has recorded several new songs to include on a greatest-hits package, 
due in November.*

 ALL THE KING'S MEN: Michael and Lisa Marie dueting at the Elvis Presley 
tribute in October? Maybe. The original band that backed Elvis in his early 
days? Maybe not. 
</P>
<P>
 The team putting together the show, scheduled for Oct. 8 at the Pyramid arena 
in Memphis, has been negotiating with guitarist Scotty Moore, drummer D.J. 
Fontana and backup singers the Jordanaires -- the surviving musicians who 
helped shape Presley's sound -- about performing at the show. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem: They want to bring along Ronnie McDowell, an Elvis sound-alike 
country singer they've been working with for the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 That package has already booked a show the same night in Indiana, but the 
tribute promoters have offered to pay off McDowell in order to free up the rest 
of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to cancel on Ronnie," says Moore, 62. "You just don't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 You can definitely catch the act (McDowell included) on Oct. 16 at the 
Shreveport (La.) Municipal Auditorium, 40 years to the day after the "Louisiana 
Hayride" show that helped spark Elvismania. Steve Hochman

 MADONNA WATCH: Madonna's look changes all the time, but her music has stayed 
fairly consistent. But she's taken off in a new direction for her upcoming 
album.The collection, just turned in to Warner Bros. Records, which distributes 
her Maverick label, is reportedly a full-out R&B affair.  
</P>
<P>
 The sometimes-blond bomber enlisted four top R&B producers to help her out: 
Babyface, Dallas Austin, Dave Hall and former Soul II Soul member Nellee 
Hooper. Hooper, in turn, brought in Icelandic sprite Bjork (whose 1993 solo 
album he produced) to write a new song, "Bedtime Story." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no title picked yet for the album, which is expected to be released in 
late fall or early winter -- in other words, in time for Christmas shoppers.

 AND ONE MORE THING: The conservative country music world is the last place 
you'd expect to find a film director best known for steamy sex scenes. But 
Zalman King, whose credits include "9 1/2 Weeks" and "Wild Orchid," has filmed 
a 30-second TV commercial for country singer John Berry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Country singers sing about all this stuff -- they just don't show it," says 
Berry of the romantic content of the clip, which features him and a sultry 
female love interest to the tune of his "Your Love Amazes Me," a No. 1 country 
hit this year.  
</P>
<P>
 In truth, the clip tells its short story more through inference than actual 
visuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The song is quite romantic, and even though John and the woman never get 
together, you feel a tremendous longing between them," says King, who is 
finishing work on his next film, "Delta of Venus," based on an Anais Nin erotic 
story, which he expects to get an NC-17 rating. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked about the teaming, Bob Freese, Liberty Records' vice president of sales 
and marketing, says, "We were looking for something outside the norm to help 
people get to know John better."*

PRIVATE LIVES; FAMILY; CREATING A SYNERGY ALONG THE MIRACLE MILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Anne Bergman, Anne Bergman is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A saber-toothed tiger, a tiny replica of the Fountainebleu, a Rodin sculpture 
garden and an authentic Indy race car are now all within walking distance along 
Wilshire Boulevard's Miracle Mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Who said that nobody walks in L.A.? 
</P>
<P>
 The rejuvenation of the Miracle Mile district, and what will soon be marketed 
as a freshly formed Museum Row, promises at least five good reasons for 
Angelenos to get out of their cars: the George C. Page Museum at the La Brea 
Tar Pits, the renovated Craft and Folk Art Museum, the Museum of Miniatures, 
the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and the Petersen Automotive Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile the future of this area is strengthened by the planned refurbishing 
of Hancock Park -- which surrounds both the Page and LACMA -- and LACMA's 
acquisition of the May Co. building, which LACMA plans on turning into a 
multi-use arts space. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock Park's make-over will include landscaping, new lighting and an upgrade 
in security. These improvements, says Dr. James Powell, president and director 
of the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History, which owns and operates 
both the Page and the Petersen, will "represent a significant improvement, 
making the area much more congenial." 
</P>
<P>
 The trick will be in linking these museums, and packaging them to the public 
as a one-stop, yet diverse, attraction. While the museums themselves are 
working together to figure how best to accomplish this -- whether it's a Museum 
Row credit card, good for all five museums within a set time period, or 
offering discounts to members of all five institutions to all museums -- it's 
something they all agree is worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a synergy that's created that benefits us all," says Stephanie 
Barron, LACMA's curator of 20th-Century art, of the close proximity of the 
other museums. "A visitor can come to a single destination to mingle among more 
than one collection." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an overview of what just one stop can offer to a Museum Row visitor. 
PETERSEN AUTOMOTIVE MUSEUM 
</P>
<P>
 The Petersen Automotive Museum, the latest addition to Museum Row, chronicles 
America's fascination with the automobile and its impact upon life in Los 
Angeles -- from steam cars to the Edsel to what Angelenos will be driving in 
2001. 
</P>
<P>
 Huge dioramas, simulated driving experiences, a gallery of classic and 
infamous cars, and the artwork these cars have inspired are all on display, 
with more interactive exhibits planned for the future. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the innate autocentricity of this museum, it's fitting that when 
you call for directions, you get the museum's precise location in the Thomas 
Bros. Guide complete with grid number. 
</P>
<P>
 Open seven days a week: Saturdays-Thursdays 10 a.m.-6 p.m.; Fridays 10 a.m. 
Admission is $7 for adults, $5 for seniors and students, and $3 for children 
aged 5-12. 6060 Wilshire Blvd., (213) 930-2277. THE GEORGE C. PAGE MUSEUM 
</P>
<P>
 The George C. Page Museum gives tours not only within its museum walls, but 
outside in the surrounding Hancock Park. The park tours begin at 1 p.m. every 
Tuesday-Sunday, and provide a detailed glimpse of Los Angeles from the time 
when it was underneath the Pacific Ocean, to the time when mastodons grazed for 
food and found themselves knee-deep in lethal goo, up to today when passers-by 
are warned to stay away from the asphalt bubbling up throughout the park, lest 
they too get stuck. 
</P>
<P>
 This black sticky stuff, contrary to popular belief, is not tar, it's asphalt, 
mistaken for tar in the late 1700s by the governor of Lower California, Gaspar 
de Portola, during an expedition to what was to become Los Angeles. Major Henry 
Hancock eventually obtained the land -- known by the 1860s as Rancho La Brea 
(or "tar ranch") -- which he mined for asphalt and drilled for oil. Inside the 
Page Museum, the skeletons of the many species of mammals trapped in the Rancho 
La Brea asphalt are on display, including: the Columbian Mammoth, the 
saber-toothed cat and La Brea Woman, whose 9,000-year-old remains are of the 
only human being found at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Open seven days a week , 10 a.m.-5 p.m. Admission is $5 for adults, $3.50 for 
seniors and students, $2 for children aged 5-10, and free for children under 5. 
No admission charge on the first Tuesday of every month. 5801 Wilshire Blvd., 
(213) 857-6311.  
</P>
<P>
 MUSEUM OF MINIATURES 
</P>
<P>
 Be prepared to be personally greeted at the Carole and Barry Kaye Museum of 
Miniatures by curator Carole Kaye herself. "Everything's real," Kaye assures of 
the collection of the tiniest of the tiny, "from the sterling silver to the 
parquet floors, to the porcelain dishes." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from traditional dollhouses, the Museum of Miniatures, which opened 
across the street from LACMA in June, also features the smallest pipe in the 
world (which can only be seen through a magnifying glass), an exact replica of 
a Broadway show girl's dressing room from the late 1930s and an antique Chinese 
temple made of cloisonne and agate. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection is completely accessible to children via booster steps in front 
of each room-box display, while Kaye says children's handprints on the walls 
prompt a repainting every week. The museum will also soon offer classes on 
flower, doll and room-box making taught by top miniaturists. 
</P>
<P>
 Open Tuesdays-Saturdays 10 a.m.-5 p.m., Sundays 11 a.m.-5 p.m. Admission is 
$7.50 for adults, $6.50 for seniors, $5 for students aged 12-21, and $3 for 
children aged 3-12. 5900 Wilshire Blvd., (213) 937-6464. THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY 
MUSEUM OF ART 
</P>
<P>
 LACMA, the grande dame of Museum Row, shares Hancock Park along with the Page 
and houses a broad collection of art from the pre-Columbian era to the present. 
</P>
<P>
 Docent-guided tours are offered Wednesdays-Sundays of both the permanent and 
special exhibitions, while Sundays in the museum, a program for children and 
their families featuring multicultural art, music, dance theater and 
storytelling, complements current special exhibitions.  
</P>
<P>
 Open Wednesdays and Thursdays 10 a.m.-5 p.m.; Fridays 10 a.m.-9 p.m.; 
Saturdays and Sundays 10 a.m.-6 p.m. Admission is $6 for adults, $4 for seniors 
and students and $1 for children aged 6-17. Free admission on the second 
Wednesday of every month. 5905 Wilshire Blvd., (213) 857-6000. CRAFT AND FOLK 
ART MUSEUM 
</P>
<P>
 Museum-goers will have to be patient for one element of Museum Row: the Craft 
and Folk Art Museum -- which has returned from its spot in the May Co. building 
to its original site across the street from the Page. Still resettling and 
renovating, the museum is set to reopen in early 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 The Craft and Folk Art Museum's collection, which opened in 1965, the same 
year as LACMA, contains both objects and artwork that spring from daily life. 
"It's art that's understood by an array of people," says executive director 
Patrick Ela of the work on display at the Craft and Folk Art Museum. "Most 
cultures in the world make masks, or floor coverings . . . their own folk art 
which represent their value systems."  
</P>
<P>
 Aside from craft and folk art, the three-story gallery will also feature a 
restaurant (with a view of the La Brea mastodons just across the street) and an 
orientation gallery in which patrons can interact with their thoughts about the 
collection. "We want to know what people think about the work," says Kim 
Litsey, director of development.*

PRIVATE LIVES; COMPUTER GAMES; IS 'SIMCITY' TOO BIG FOR YOU? PACK UP AND MOVE 
TO 'SIMTOWN'; COME THIS FALL, KIDS (OF ALL AGES) WILL GET TO SEE WHAT ALL THE 
SIMFUSS HAS BEEN ABOUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Colker, David Colker is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tired of being the only one in the house obsessed with "SimCity," the 
addictive computer game that allows you to build and lord over a functioning 
metropolis? 
</P>
<P>
 Come this fall, you can get the kids hooked too. 
</P>
<P>
 "SimTown," aimed at the 8-to-12-year-old crowd, will be the latest in the 
popular Sim series that includes "SimAnt" (allows you to build an electronic 
ant colony), "SimLife" (allows you to play God), the original "SimCity" and its 
futuristic sequel, "SimCity 2000." These current titles are fairly-to-extremely 
complicated, and all are time consuming. Long before your "SimCity" starts 
functioning on the computer screen, for example, you are called upon to work 
out a zoning scheme, provide utilities and establish the beginnings of a street 
grid. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when your electronic Sims (simulated citizens) start to move in, you 
have to give them access to city services, update the infrastructure, build 
schools, levy taxes, deal with ecological issues, balance the budget and deal 
with natural disasters. That's entertainment. Judging from a "SimTown" beta 
(the software world's term for a rough cut), this latest title is not just a 
cut-down version of "SimCity." It's indeed less cerebral and not as graphically 
beautiful as the adult game, but "SimTown" does give you more hands-on control 
over the design of your city and demand far less of a time commitment to make 
significant progress. 
</P>
<P>
 To get "SimTown" going, you simply drag a mouse cursor across the grid 
depicted on the screen and add some homes. Suddenly, Sims will appear -- 
walking, biking, skateboarding and running, all to the beat of an innocuous 
tune. Like in "SimCity 2000," you can see characters swarming over the grid, 
but in "SimTown" you can get close enough to actually see their faces and watch 
their activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The choices you get in houses are varied and fanciful. There's your basic 
ranch and adobe, but then there is also the Swiss chalet, the futuristic, 
Tudor, Japanese and Victorian models, not to mention a castle and haunted 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Put them all together on a street and you get the design sensibility of Las 
Vegas. But unlike in "SimCity," where the program chooses the houses as 
neighborhoods grow, you get to determine the look of a street by mixing and 
matching. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the businesses are high-design fanciful, including a building in the 
shape of a giant take-out container for a Chinese restaurant, a library made 
out of stacks of books and a post office decorated with huge package and 
envelope sculptures. 
</P>
<P>
 Eat your heart out, Michael Graves. 
</P>
<P>
 You can also choose from various bits of greenery -- grass, trees, flower 
gardens, topiary -- to landscape your cityscape. And what would an all-American 
town be without a bowling alley and movie theater? 
</P>
<P>
 The basic idea is to provide adequate services for the population level, which 
increases with each house or apartment building you erect. If you have too few 
people to keep the number of businesses healthy, the businesses will start to 
fail, leaving you with unsightly abandoned buildings. With too many people, the 
town will get crowded and you'll get shortages of resources. 
</P>
<P>
 You also have to choose the right kinds of businesses for your Sims. If you 
get too many characters wanting pizza and have too few pizza parlors, some of 
them will pack up and move out. 
</P>
<P>
 Disasters can strike suddenly. While carefully laying in a tasteful garden and 
pond in the vicinity of the zoo, I failed to notice that my Chinese restaurant 
and city hall had caught on fire and were burning to the ground. There wasn't 
much I could do, anyway -- I had forgotten to put in a fire station. in the 
town. 
</P>
<P>
 Oops. That's a mistake an 8- to 12-year-old wouldn't make. 
</P>
<P>
 "SimTown" will be released by its publisher, Maxis, in October or November for 
Macintosh and Windows CD-ROMs. Retail list price will be $44.95.*

 DOWNED PLANE: A private plane leased by the U.S. Forest Service to help combat 
fires crashed Saturday in Angeles National Forest, killing at least two people. 
(B1) . . . Authorities said the plane was en route to a Kern County blaze with 
a cargo of fire-retardant chemicals. The wreck sparked two small fires, but no 
homes were threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 TENNIS TALK: If there is one thing 16-year-old girls can do, it's talk. So 
when Meilen Tu of Northridge combined her tennis skills with pep talks to 
herself, a national championship resulted. (C10) . . . "Talking to myself 
helped me relax and play better," said Meilen, who won the singles title in the 
United States Tennis Assn. Girls' 18 national championship in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 TIME OFF: Dodger broadcaster Ross Porter (above) is crazy about stats, but one 
he discovered Friday probably won't go down as one of his favorites. "I told my 
wife this is the first time in my married life, 33 years, that there may be no 
income coming in," said Porter, of Calabasas Park. . . . Porter was paid during 
the 1981 strike, but his current contract doesn't offer similar protection. 
</P>
<P>
 FORE!: Well, if a man's not going to get paid, he might as well improve his 
handicap. Which is exactly what Porter, 55, intends to do until the players and 
owners can get their act together. He'll play at courses near Palm Springs, and 
also plans to visit his grandkids. . . . But he says the sudden vacation won't 
change his life too much. "The season was winding down already," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 BLYTHE SPIRIT: Residents of one of the Valley's most blighted streets put on a 
festival of Mexican food, drink and music Saturday in an effort to reclaim the 
neighborhood from local gangs. . . . The Vecino a Vecino celebration -- 
Neighbor to Neighbor -- reflected a new sense of empowerment among residents. 
"There is a lot of natural leadership here," said Margaret-Rose Welch, who is 
helping to revitalize the three-block Blythe Street area. (B1) Michael Arkush

N. KOREAN SEES NEW ERA IN U.S. RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A senior North Korean official said Saturday that a nuclear accord between 
North Korea and the United States will help forge a new era of normal relations 
between the two countries by establishing a basis for enhanced "trust and 
confidence" on nuclear issues and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare interview, Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju, the chief North 
Korean negotiator on nuclear matters, hailed the two-page statement of 
understanding approved by the U.S. and North Korean governments as an 
expression of "our clear intentions to resolve our nuclear issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal calls for Washington to arrange for construction of several 
Western-style nuclear reactors in North Korea and to move toward establishing 
normal diplomatic relations. In return, it commits North Korea to halting its 
production of plutonium for possible use in nuclear arms, and eventually to 
halting work on several reactors that are considered tailor-made for plutonium 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Kang declined to express confidence that all unresolved disputes can be 
settled, but he said all would be addressed in discussions with U.S. technical 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Secretary of State Robert L. Gallucci, who spoke at a news 
conference at 2 a.m. Saturday, agreed that the talks had reduced suspicion 
about the likelihood of progress. He said the level of trust between the 
delegations was "higher than it was before this round of talks" and called the 
accord an important "first step" toward a broader nuclear agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Further negotiations are scheduled in Geneva on Sept. 23 on the interim energy 
alternatives North Korea has been promised, establishing liaison offices in 
Washington and Pyongyang as a first step to full mutual recognition, final 
disposal of about 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods now corroding in a cooling pond 
north of Pyongyang, and providing the new reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid hefty costs to the U.S. taxpayer, Gallucci is trying to arrange for 
Germany and Japan, and perhaps South Korea, to pay most of the cost of the new 
reactors, which would be provided by South Korea or Russia. The United States 
would supply technical experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington will also have to find an interim source of alternative power, 
probably oil, to compensate the North Koreans for energy they could have 
received from two graphite reactors nearing completion. 
</P>
<P>
 Kang confirmed that his government remains unwilling to allow the 
international inspection of two suspected nuclear waste sites to which it 
denied access in February, 1993, triggering U.S. threats to pursue U.N.-backed 
economic sanctions against North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We on our part do not recognize the special inspections" demanded by the 
International Atomic Energy Agency at those sites, Kang said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kang did not rule out a possible settlement of this issue or any other 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials say the inspections are needed to determine whether North Korea 
had accumulated enough plutonium to make several nuclear bombs, as U.S. 
officials suspect. According to Gallucci, North Korea will not receive any of 
the new reactors unless it approves the inspections and clears up the mystery 
about its past plutonium production. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the preliminary accord resulted from some concessions by both sides 
-- including North Korea's withdrawal of its insistence that it reprocess fuel 
rods -- Kang said his government's position is "consistent" with its previous 
stance. 
</P>
<P>
 He dismissed speculation that the accord was reached because the death of 
President Kim Il Sung had made foreign policy more flexible.

STEELERS HAVE IT AT FINISH; PRO FOOTBALL: RAIDERS UNABLE TO HOLD ONTO LEADS AND 
PITTSBURGH RALLIES FOR A 29-17 VICTORY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Neil O'Donnell and Mike Tomczak each directed two scoring drives and the 
Pittsburgh Steelers rebounded from deficits in each half to beat the Raiders, 
29-17, on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Jones, Pittsburgh's fourth-team fullback, scored on two 1-yard runs in 
the fourth quarter to prevent the Raiders from opening an exhibition season 3-0 
for the first time in 11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Each team lost players to ejections -- NFL defensive player of the year Rod 
Woodson for Pittsburgh and Jerry Ball for the Raiders -- and Steelers 
linebacker Rico Mack suffered a possible season-ending fractured ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hostetler and Vince Evans threw touchdown passes to Darryl Hobbs in the 
first half for Los Angeles (2-1), but Pittsburgh (1-1) rallied with mostly 
reserves on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbs, sometimes overlooked among a receiving corps that includes Rocket 
Ismail, Tim Brown and James Jett, caught an 8-yard touchdown pass from 
Hostetler and a 12-yarder from Evans. 
</P>
<P>
 Hobbs has three touchdowns among his nine receptions for 160 yards as the 
receivers have accounted for seven of the Raiders' eight touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Jaeger's 27-yard field goal midway through the third period put the 
Raiders up 17-14 in their first exhibition ever in Pittsburgh, but they bogged 
down after that with Billy Joe Hobert at quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Tomczak, who has little competition for the Steelers' backup job, hit Corey 
Holliday for 19 yards ahead of three Chuckie Dukes runs for 19 yards before 
Jones made it 21-17 with 12:14 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Holliday then partially blocked Jeff Gossett's punt, giving the Steelers 
excellent field position at their own 49. Tomczak needed eight plays to get 
into the end zone, finding Andre Hastings for 15 yards on a third-and-10 before 
scrambling for 28 yards to the 1 on a broken third-and-14 play. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jones' TD with 6:34 remaining, Randy Cuthbert ran into the end zone on 
the first 2-point conversion attempted by Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler, again playing only the first period, was 4 of 9 for 45 yards and a 
touchdown. Evans was 8-for-11 for 100 yards and a TD. O'Donnell, playing the 
entire first half, was 11 of 17 for 94 yards and a 3-yard TD to Tim Jorden. 
Tomczak was 7 of 15 for 83 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Dwight Stone scored Pittsburgh's first touchdown on an 18-yard reverse with 
2:14 remaining in the first quarter, making it 7-7.

MANHATTAN BEACH.

 Ann Grossman, a Midwest farmer's daughter who is winless in six years on the 
tour, outlasted seventh-seeded Julie Halard of France, 1-6, 6-3, 6-1, on 
Saturday in the semifinals of the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles in Manhattan 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman advanced to today's final against Sabine Appelmans of Belgium or Amy 
Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman has made three-setters a habit during the tournament, going the 
distance in four of five matches. She put together three-set upsets of 
second-seeded Martina Navratilova in the third round and No. 5 Zina 
Garrison-Jackson in Friday's quarterfinals en route to her first final of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Halard, who was the highest seeded player in the semifinals, raced through the 
first set in 26 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just really stiff and I wasn't reading the ball that well," Grossman 
said of her slow start in the 120-degree playing conditions. "I just hung in 
there and came up with some huge shots and I think that frustrated her." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman began her turnaround in the sixth game of the second set when Halard 
netted a service return. She won eight consecutive games to even the match at a 
set apiece and take a 4-0 lead in the third. 
</P>
<P>
 Halard, who defeated Grossman in three sets in their only other meeting in 
1991 on hard courts, completely unraveled at the end of the second set. She 
double faulted three times, including set point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't feeling good this morning," said Halard, who is ranked 18th. "I knew 
I could win this match. I had chances, but I just couldn't fight anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Halard salvaged only one of four service breaks in the third set and meekly 
netted a forehand service return on match point. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came out playing pretty dumb, but I worked my way into it," Grossman said. 
"If things are going that bad and I can turn things around, that says 
something. I mentally broke her down and I was physically stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman, 23, grew up on a farm outside Columbus, Ohio, hitting balls against 
a plywood wall her father installed in the family's cement-floor barn. With 
cows as her company, Grossman practiced the groundstrokes that usually keep her 
glued to the baseline.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is where it's all paying off," said Grossman, whose father died three 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Ranked 46th, she has been in eight finals since turning pro in 1988 and lost 
them all. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman was hopeful that reaching the final would make her front-page news in 
today's Columbus (Ohio) Dispatch sports section. The aspiring model still lives 
in suburban Grove City. 
</P>
<P>
 "They had an article about it but I wasn't on the front page," she said. "I 
was like, 'Come on, it doesn't get any better. What do I need to do?' "

 Fourstardave, the 9-year-old gelding who has become an institution in Saratoga 
racing, is finished for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 He severely sprained his left ankle turning for home in Friday's running of 
the Bernard Baruch Handicap, in which he finished third. Fourstardave was 
leading coming into the stretch, but was passed with a furlong to go by Lure, 
the eventual winner, and Paradise Creek. 
</P>

 He is expected to recover and his connections are hopeful that he will be able 
to resume in competition next year.

'FREEDOM SUMMER' LEGACY CAN'T WIPE OUT THE SOUTH'S PROBLEMS; MISSISSIPPI: 1964 
CIVIL RIGHTS DRIVE SIGNED UP 80,000 BLACK VOTERS. BUT MANY FAIL TO CAST BALLOTS 
TODAY, AND BLACK HISTORY IS OBSCURE.

<P>
 Very quietly, as tourists click snapshots of Confederate monuments in the 
Vicksburg National Military Park, black people arrive in pairs or whole 
families and fill up area hotels. 
</P>
<P>
 They come from near -- Alabama, Texas, Louisiana -- and far -- Michigan, 
California, Nevada, Illinois. Hugs go around, as do exclamations of joy when 
family and friends collide. 
</P>
<P>
 It's Fourth of July weekend in Vicksburg, a city of 25,000 that lolls among 
sun-seared pines on the banks of the Mississippi River. It's also reunion time 
and, if you're black and you're from Vicksburg, you drop what you're doing and 
go home. 
</P>
<P>
 The South still means home to so many black Americans, despite its brutal 
history. 
</P>
<P>
 Their ancestors were slaves whose labor drove the antebellum South's agrarian 
economy, who were freed to endure lynchings and rigid segregation and then 
jailed, bombed or killed trying to break racism's grip on their futures. 
</P>
<P>
 So why do blacks, like those in Vicksburg, hold the region in such high esteem 
that they eagerly return? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a saying, 'The greater the oppression, the better the product,' " 
said Marshall Sanders, 43, an attorney who has practiced in Vicksburg for 16 
years. "The South is where you will see the leadership that will bring our 
people out of the dirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Blacks in the South now earn college degrees, run businesses, own land. They 
hold elected office in far greater numbers than in any other region. Parents 
send their children to spend summers with grandparents here, because the racial 
danger the South once represented is nowhere near the perils black children 
everywhere now face. 
</P>
<P>
 Many credit the region's face lift to the Freedom Summer Project of 1964, 
through which 1,000 college students registered voters, educated children and 
ran community centers to chisel away at formal segregation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, Freedom 
Summer's greatest impact was in the political arena. The students put 80,000 
black voters on the rolls and boosted black participation in elections from 
6.7% to 60% within two years. Mississippi now has 751 black elected officials, 
the most of any state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It set in motion a series of political and social changes that were slow to 
come but that nonetheless were profound," Frank Parker, a Washington law 
professor who litigated civil rights suits throughout the South, wrote of 
Freedom Summer. "One might say that Mississippi has generally caught up with 
the rest of the country only to find that it shares the rest of America's 
lingering social and racial problems." 
</P>
<P>
 In Vicksburg, the impact of Freedom Summer these 30 years later is embodied in 
the contrast of the easy coexistence of blacks and whites and the still-keen 
sense that racist attitudes never will vanish. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the South, where there seems to be a lot of prejudice, I didn't learn to 
dislike or hate," said Doris Tatum-Clavelle, 49, a Vicksburg native who 
returned home 20 years ago after living in Chicago and New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is still that inner peace, life that is just a little bit easier, a 
little bit more comfortable. You get back in Mississippi and the differences 
just slap you in the face." 
</P>
<P>
 Being black in the South means acceding to a love-hate existence. It means 
loving the laid-back, nearly conflict-free life, but hating the history of 
oppression that underlies, and too often undermines, this hard-earned ease. 
</P>
<P>
 It means frustration when black people shrink from public fights for their 
place in history and the community, but comfort that, when someone needs a meal 
or a ride or a flat tire changed, someone else in the community always steps 
forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of individuals in Vicksburg regularly wrestle with this duality. 
</P>
<P>
 There is the woman who spent much of her life staring down racists in the 
civil rights movement, only to fear today's rebellious, gun-toting black 
children more than she ever dreaded the Ku Klux Klan. 
</P>
<P>
 The man who became the city's first black mayor, only to feel the anger of 
black voters who felt he had abandoned their concerns for the interests of the 
city's wealthy whites. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who stepped across invisible boundaries to become Vicksburg's first 
black female police officer, only to encourage her twin sons to seek law 
enforcement careers elsewhere, knowing they could only go so far at home. 
</P>
<P>
 And the children growing up in this new South, struggling to find their place 
in a world of subtle and sometimes conflicting messages. 
</P>
<P>
 As so many of these Southerners say, they can be so many things, achieve so 
many things, but still, to many people, they are only one thing: They are 
black. 
</P>
<P>
 And so they remain here. The South is their home. 
</P>

 It happened in 1928, but Lee Willa Miller remembers it as if it were 
yesterday. 
</P>
<P>
 She was 11, and her father had died. Within days, a white man came to collect 
a $300 debt. Her mother had no money, so he seized the family's 200-acre farm. 
He took two mules, a wagon and a couple of houses too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt like I had nothing to lose," Miller said. "And I was ready to 
fight. I've stepped on a lot of white people's toes, happily." 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Willa Miller is 77 now, sitting with her left hand gently propped on the 
metal cane resting beside her in her painfully neat white frame house. Her 
knees are sore and scarred from recent surgery, but she is cheerfully dainty, 
like a genteel grandmother entertaining members of the garden club. 
</P>
<P>
 Her presence and her words don't match. There's still a lot of unspent anger 
in Miller, who joined the NAACP in 1950 as a wife and mother and promptly began 
registering black voters in the Mississippi backlands. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a woman who worked shoulder-to-shoulder with such seminal black 
figures as Medgar Evers, Fannie Lou Hamer, James Meredith. She quit her 
catering job when her boss called her in to work as she tearfully watched the 
Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral on television. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is a sage of sorts on politics, civil rights history, black voting 
habits. Politicians court her endorsement and seek her advice. Those who win 
say they wouldn't be in office without her. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent election, Miller worked to help state Rep. Ken Harper in a runoff 
for a U.S. Senate seat. Harper won, but Miller was disappointed: Black voter 
turnout was only 7% not much more than it was before 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere along the line, some of us got too comfortable and relaxed in going 
to vote," Miller said. "I stay on my telephone. I sit up in my bed, and I call 
and call." 
</P>
<P>
 With 1928 burned in her memory, Lee Willa Miller marched and organized during 
the civil rights movement, encouraging black folks to get an education and 
attack racist systems from within, like cancer. The places she ventured were so 
dangerous she often didn't tell her husband for fear he would try to stop her. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller doesn't see racism scraping against black people in the South as 
roughly as it scraped her back in 1928; she sees a more insidious form that 
foments black self-destruction through unemployment, drugs, crime or the 
breakdown of the family. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somewhere along the line, we've made progress, but somewhere along the line, 
we've gone back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got some black folks who live well. But it's not enough. The white man 
has still got his foot on us here. White people are white people, and don't 
ever forget they're white. They're not going to ever want you to come up to 
their equal." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's own deprived childhood -- she never finished high school -- made her 
determined to educate her five children, all of whom are college graduates. 
Naturally, she pushed other black children to go to school. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when she would report truant children, scold them and send 
them back to class. But not anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's children fill Miller with more fear than any number of the 
shotgun-toting mobs, hooded Ku Klux Klansmen or lurking pipe bombs she 
confronted in the '60s. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't do that now, you know, because they will shoot in your houses," she 
said. "Crack's got me more fearful now than back then. There used to be a time 
when black folks didn't kill black folks; white folks killed black folks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looks like the white folks now are sitting back to say, 'I don't have to kill 
(them) because they gonna kill one another.' And doesn't it look like we're 
doing it?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its majority black population, Vicksburg didn't elect its first black 
mayor, Robert Walker, until 1988. Black residents poured a lot of energy into 
Walker's campaign; they were proud when he took office -- and are still reeling 
over his defeat last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Many feel Walker lost because some blacks deliberately stayed home on Election 
Day, feeling he was too eager to please white constituents and didn't do enough 
for the people who helped elect him. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, black residents are unhappy with the current mayor, and there is 
an effort to get Walker to run again. He's not sure he will. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I've had my time," he said. "You have to do your best, and I did my 
best while I was there." 
</P>
<P>
 Walker, 48, is a former state NAACP official who teaches political science at 
two black colleges. He is a product of the civil rights movement -- "All my 
summers have been Freedom Summers" -- who wants to put his energy into grooming 
young blacks for political careers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People of my generation have, in many ways, had their best shot with history 
and destiny," Walker said. "And for the last 20 years of their holding onto 
positions, they have done more harm than they have done good. It's somebody 
else's turn now." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the number of Mississippi's black elected officials, there is a sense 
in Vicksburg that blacks are slowly losing grip on public office. Gertrude 
Young is the only black member of the city council, even though Vicksburg is 
more then 55% black. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where did we go wrong?" Young said. "I don't care how high you climb, you are 
still black." 
</P>
<P>
 That's one reason that Dora Smith -- Vickburg's first black policewoman -- and 
her husband, Charles, want their children to leave Vicksburg, as they did 
temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not unusual. Many black folks were born here and moved away, then 
returned to rear children whom they actively encourage to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care about moving nowhere, but ain't nothing here for them," said 
Charles Smith, a 48-year-old welder, referring to his five children. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's two eldest sons will graduate soon from historically black Alcorn 
State University with degrees in criminal justice. Dora Smith, a 17-year 
veteran who works in juvenile investigations, said she doesn't expect her sons 
to join her on Vicksburg's force. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to make more money, they have to move," she said. "It would be 
best." 
</P>
<P>
 "Blacks don't make any money," Charles Smith said. "Whites have all the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 But still, Smith is too taken with the quality of life in Vicksburg to leave. 
He owns 11 acres of land, and has bequeathed parcels to his children, with the 
condition that they sell their shares only to another sibling. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no place like home," he said simply. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Vicksburg has no juvenile detention center, so children who commit crimes 
often are back on the streets quickly after a first offense and later crimes 
can land them in jail with adults. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Rev. James Warren decided to try to save them himself. He cleaned up an 
abandoned community center and turned it into a program for young first 
offenders, nearly 95% of whom are black males who have flirted with gang 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren takes them in for up to 90 days, after an informal hearing and before 
they stand trial. If they pass Warren's program, they are recommended for 
probation, training or correctional school and stay out of court. So far, only 
one of 34 youths had to be returned for trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "The male needs a male figure. I am Coach, Reverend, Doctor or Dad to all of 
them," Warren said. "Of course, I have to pray and understand that I can't save 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Warren simply gives the children praise and encouragement, and requires them 
to read three books. They draw inspiration from his I Am Somebody Wall, with 
photos of people ranging from President Clinton to local judges and 
politicians, to let them see the futures they could have. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Warren's charges, Altonia Bland, 17, and Quincy Watson, 15, say they 
sense that racist attitudes hold young people down in Mississippi. But they 
aren't inclined to blame white people for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You get treated differently," Watson said. "Some people are racist. Some 
ain't. You can't say they're racist just because of their skin color. It's how 
they see their mom and dad, if they feel like their mom and dad do about black 
folk." 
</P>
<P>
 Bland, an Army brat who has lived in most parts of this country, has concluded 
that the South offers a good life, despite its stereotype as an oppressive 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he found a chance here to get into trouble with gangs, he also found 
the program that got him off the track to jail and back to high school and 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got more jobs here than in, say, D.C.," Bland said. "They give you 
more education here than anywhere else. When I was in New York, they didn't 
care. I didn't ever go to school. Here, the coach would come looking for me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, there's a lot of stereotypes around here. I thought we had come a long 
way from the past. I ask why we don't have our black history in our books. 
Since I never grew up around real harsh stereotypes, it confuses me a lot." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Lunch at the Kitchen in the Garden, a wooden shack of an eatery in the heart 
of black Vicksburg, is a release mechanism for the tight knot of black 
professionals who laugh loud and debate life over its $4.25 soul food specials. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kitchen has a backwater flavor, with its tin roof, battered screen door 
and neon beer signs in red-curtained windows. Inside, there are maybe a dozen 
booths and tables, and a big white jukebox with old blues and soul tunes on it. 
</P>
<P>
 Soap operas cast moonglow from a television set perched over the bar. It is 
twilight-dim at high noon, because the Kitchen sits under shady trees at the 
end of a dead-end street. 
</P>
<P>
 These professional folks descend on the Kitchen every day for ethnic 
rejuvenation; they are among the few blacks in their respective workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kitchen was here when Freedom Summer swept through Vicksburg. The crowd 
then gathered for news of the movement and to dream of grandeur after the death 
of Jim Crow. 
</P>
<P>
 And though Jim Crow eventually died, so did the Kitchen. Blacks began to 
patronize other, prettier restaurants; the Kitchen, in its rustic splendor, 
wasn't good enough anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some people who look at this place and turn their noses up at it," 
said Willie Thomas, an engineer. "But for me, it's my roots. I'm not ashamed of 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 When the Kitchen reopened eight years ago, Thomas and his lunch colleagues -- 
noting the precarious state of Mississippi's historically black colleges -- 
decided to do whatever was necessary to preserve a local black institution. 
</P>
<P>
 So they routinely linger over lunch to talk louder than they can anywhere else 
about religion, sex, politics and race. Besides Thomas, the crowd consists of 
an airline pilot, a federal department head and Gertrude Young, the lone black 
member of the city council. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot, Brady Tonth, finds escape and identity in the ritual give-and-take. 
He has lived in Vicksburg all his life, and he has no illusions about the 
status he feels he is accorded in society. He also has no plans to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my environment, I'm around white people all the time, and I prefer to be 
with my people as much as I can," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "See, in America, you're going to always be a nigger to white folks. I don't 
care how much money you make, how successful you are, where you are, what you 
do or how you do it. You gotta understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The words are an afterthought on the cornerstone of the Vicksburg Courthouse: 
"Built by slave labor." Although no official histories credit him by name, a 
black man named John Jackson designed the building. 
</P>
<P>
 Tillman Whitley, a local high school teacher, is confounded by the fact that, 
in an area so rich with black history -- and still full of people who lived it 
-- a man like Jackson could be overlooked so easily. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants Jackson to get his proper credit. He wants it known that slaves laid 
the bricks in Vicksburg's quaint cobblestone streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitley's musings on that subject speak to the lasting dilemma of the black 
South. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contributions the slaves made are still evident here. But you can hardly 
find a thing mentioned about what black people have done. That is by design," 
he said.

U.S. COMPANY'S SMELTER BLAMED FOR ACRID POLLUTION IN PERUVIAN TOWN; 
ENVIRONMENT: SULFUR DIOXIDE FROM PLANT IS CHOKING THE ONCE-PRODUCTIVE ILO 
VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN F. MONAHAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thick, acrid smog envelops Manuel Espejo's withering olive trees. He has 
pruned them severely in hopes they can be saved. 
</P>
<P>
 Espejo blames the damage on the fog laden with smoke from the nearby smelter 
of the Southern Peru Copper Corp., owned by a consortium of Asarco Inc. of New 
York and three other U.S. firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmers and local officials say sulfur dioxide spewed from the smelter's four 
towering stacks is choking the once-productive Ilo Valley, 580 miles southeast 
of Lima. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smoke burns all the little leaves," Espejo said. "A sprout comes out and 
it's burned, burned, burned." 
</P>
<P>
 Company vice president Charles Smith contends the agricultural problems are 
caused by poor management and lack of water on Peru's desert coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Peruvian Indians were engaged in mining long before the Spanish conquistadors 
began taking silver and gold from the Andes more than 400 years ago. Now the 
industry is enjoying a renaissance under the government's new openness to 
foreign investment. 
</P>
<P>
 But pollution, once ignored, has become a major issue. It may help explain why 
no one bid for the state-owned Centromin complex, Peru's largest mining 
company, when it was up for auction in May. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Kamp, a U.S. environmentalist, described the pollution from Centromin's 
seven mines and its smelter at La Oroya as a "vision from hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Ernesto Herrera Becerra of Ilo, a town of 60,000 people, said pollution 
from Southern Peru Copper had harmed agriculture, poisoned miles of coastline 
and ruined fishing in some areas. 
</P>
<P>
 A thick gray sludge of tailings from the company's two mines in the highlands 
runs into the ocean 30 miles south of Ilo through the old channel of the 
Locumba River, which has been diverted for irrigation. Slick, slate-colored 
silt covers the beaches and crusty deposits of mineral waste tint the shoreline 
fluorescent hues of green, yellow and blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Waste called slag has blackened three miles of beaches around the smelter 
north of Ilo where Southern, the country's largest copper-mining operation, 
produces about 300,000 tons of copper a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe Southern is a very important company here, but it is possible to 
have development while conserving the environment," Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Ilo and the national economy, Southern is a mixed blessing: It provides 
5,500 jobs and 17% of Peru's export income, but it is a major environmental 
headache. 
</P>
<P>
 Herrera said the economic issue "is the blackmail international companies use 
on countries with weak economies dependent on raw materials." 
</P>
<P>
 He thinks the worst problem is the sulfur-dioxide smog. On days when it covers 
the town, children cannot play outside. The mayor and other officials said 
respiratory ailments are common in Ilo. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Johnson, the company's environmental engineer, acknowledged that sulfur 
dioxide is "present and we need to correct the situation. At times it's 
irritating." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson added, however, that sulfur dioxide is not toxic and that the U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency describes it merely as an irritant. 
</P>
<P>
 Olive grower Jose Valencia said the smelter emissions had driven farmers from 
their homes in the valley, and that most commute from Ilo to work their land. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can't stand the smoke," he said. "None of the farmers live there. What 
the company wants is for all the farmers to leave. I have 25 hectares (62 
acres). If I leave, it will be like cutting off a leg." 
</P>
<P>
 Kamp, director of the Border Ecology Project in Bisbee, Ariz., said after a 
visit to Ilo that "Southern has perhaps the world's dirtiest copper smelter." 
</P>
<P>
 He said it emits about 2,000 tons of sulfur dioxide a day, or 15 to 20 times 
the limit for U.S. plants. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, the vice president and operations manager, said Southern pays farmers 
for crop damage but does not concede that the smoke actually causes it. He said 
the government, "with little recognition of the facts," requires the payments. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern plans to spend $300 million on modernization over five years, Smith 
said, two-thirds of it for such environmental purposes as reducing emissions 
and disposing of tailings without dumping them into the Pacific. He said a 
$110-million plant will be built to convert sulfur dioxide into sulfuric acid 
for use in the mining operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say the plans will reduce sulfur-dioxide emissions by only 20%. Smith 
responds that it is "economically impossible" for Southern to capture all the 
emissions because there is no market for the sulfuric acid that would be 
produced.

TOURISTS, WILD HORSES CLASH ON ATLANTIC BARRIER ISLANDS; NORTH CAROLINA: THE 
TASK OF SEGREGATING ANIMALS AND VACATIONERS ON THE OUTER BANKS HAS PROVED 
INSURMOUNTABLE. ONLY 23 OF THE 'BANKERS' REMAIN ALIVE AND FACE EXTINCTION. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Until the mid-1980s, Corolla was an isolated hamlet of a few dozen families, 
with a deteriorating lighthouse and a small herd of wild horses. 
</P>
<P>
 But then a paved road reached this northernmost community on North Carolina's 
Outer Banks, a slender string of barrier islands stretching 175 miles from 
Virginia to Cape Lookout. 
</P>
<P>
 The state highway -- Route 12 -- brought thousands of tourists, a spectacular 
real estate boom and increasingly opulent summer cottages. 
</P>
<P>
 It also threatened extinction of the free-roaming "banker horses." With the 
birth of a colt this spring, they number only 23, a tiny remnant of the 
hundreds that once populated the area. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past five years, 14 animals in the Corolla herd have been killed by 
automobiles. Last summer, a 2-year-old colt, lured to the deck of a beach house 
by vacationers offering food, was seriously injured when it lost its footing 
and tumbled down the stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 The task of segregating horses and vacationers -- the latter totaling as many 
as 40,000 a week during the summer -- has proved to be insurmountable. The 
animals are wild in name only. They graze lawns and tramp through flower beds. 
</P>
<P>
 Camera-toting visitors pursue them relentlessly and, at risk of being nipped 
or kicked, offer them apples, pizza and saltwater taffy. 
</P>
<P>
 Fascination with the animals springs in part from the lore surrounding their 
origin. 
</P>
<P>
 The enduring but disputed account is that the mustangs' ancestors arrived on 
the Outer Banks with Spanish explorers early in the 16th Century. When 
colonization failed and the Spaniards moved on, the horses are said to have 
been left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Burrus, a Cape Hatteras, N.C., businessman and an inspector for the 
Spanish Mustang Registry, says the Corolla horses and another herd on Ocracoke 
Island, N.C., have at least one important feature -- one fewer vertebra than 
most breeds -- that supports the story. 
</P>
<P>
 But skeptics insist that most horses on the islands are descended from stock 
raised by farmers from Colonial times to the early 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way to disprove the stories of Spanish origin," said Bruce 
Rodgers, a National Park Service resource management specialist. "But the only 
accounts that can really be documented are the stories that farmers took horses 
to the islands from the mainland." 
</P>
<P>
 Corolla isn't the only place on the increasingly crowded Atlantic islands 
where feral horses and ponies are in perplexing conflict with humanity and a 
fragile environment. 
</P>
<P>
 At three national seashores on the Atlantic -- Assateague in Maryland, Cape 
Lookout in North Carolina and Cumberland Island in Georgia -- their foraging 
damages dunes and marshes. It threatens the habitat of such rare creatures as 
the loggerhead turtle, the piping plover, the wood stork and the Delmarva 
Peninsula fox. 
</P>
<P>
 At Assateague, located on a skinny, 37-mile-long island of the same name off 
Maryland and Virginia, a herd of ponies that numbered fewer than 20 during the 
1960s is expected to total 180 with the arrival of this year's foals. They're 
smaller than the Carolina horses and multicolored, not solid like the Outer 
Banks animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Assateague ponies' impact on the dunes is more obvious, their 
threat to the delicately balanced plant and animal communities in the 
surrounding marshes is more serious, said Carl Zimmerman, the seashore's 
manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage has aroused sharp concern among conservationists. But even though 
the ponies aren't indigenous to the islands, Congress has determined that they 
belong on the national seashores. Why? Because they're popular with visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 So, when the Assateague seashore was established 30 years ago, lawmakers 
designated the ponies a "desirable feral species" and charged the Park Service 
with protecting them. At the time, researchers concluded that 120 to 150 
animals were acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 But, said Zimmerman, "We now think that 150 may be too many. We are seeing 
unacceptable damage at the present level." 
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, after six years of testing, the Park Service has launched a 
birth-control program that uses an injection to reduce the Assateague herd to 
150 or fewer. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists will conduct more tests before considering a full-fledged control 
effort at Cape Lookout and Cumberland Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Herds of about 100 horses each roam both areas, causing the same kind of 
damage as at Assateague. But because "the horses have a very big constituency," 
any steps to control them will be taken with care, Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 In some areas, fences have been erected to prevent damage and control 
population growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocracoke Island's 40 horses are kept in a paddock. A fence separates the herd 
of 150 ponies at Virginia's Chincoteague National Wildlife Refuge on southern 
Assateague Island from the herd on the national seashore. The refuge was made 
famous by Misty, the fictional pony in a popular children's book. 
</P>
<P>
 The volunteer fire department in the mainland town of Chincoteague owns the 
Virginia herd, whose size is controlled by a colorful annual auction that 
attracts thousands of tourists and hundreds of bidders. 
</P>
<P>
 In Corolla, this probably will be the last summer the "banker horses" mingle 
with tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans are to move them north of town onto 15,000 acres of state and federal 
lands. A fence reaching from Currituck Sound to the Atlantic across a narrow 
neck of land will prevent their return to Corolla's crowded summer playground. 
</P>
<P>
 The horses' exile will mark both victory and defeat for activists of the 
Corolla Wild Horse Fund. They have saved the herd, whose numbers fell to nine 
several years ago, but they have failed to keep an acceptable distance between 
the animals and the growing hordes of tourists. 
</P>
<P>
 To the disappointment of some fund supporters, state and county officials 
rejected a proposal to build a paddock. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that since they have been here for 400 years, they have a right to 
stay here," said Rowena Dorman, director of the fund's sanctuary program.

WOODSTOCK ROCKS AND ROLLS -- ON TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID BAUDER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concertgoers strolled the fields naked, wearing tie-dye and getting high 
Friday like the let-it-all-hang-out generation before them, with one big 
difference: This Woodstock opened on time and fully wired. 
</P>
<P>
 About 75,000 people had arrived by the noon opening act at Woodstock '94, a 
local heavy metal band called Roguish Armament with Rekk. 
</P>
<P>
 In decibels and attitude, it was a far cry from Richie Havens, the folk singer 
who was the last-minute choice to open the original Woodstock 25 years ago 
because the sound system wasn't ready. He went on stage hours late. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's music history in the making. It's good to be a part of it," said Michael 
Link, 25, of Gore, Va., who doffed his shirt to show off his nipple ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening ceremonies included psychedelic artist Peter Max urging the crowd to 
behave since "the whole world is watching," and Mohawk Indians dancing and 
singing for peace, harmony and love. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the mainly 20-something crowd harkened back to the free-spirited 
original Woodstock by walking around naked and smoking marijuana. Some skipped 
through a "misting machine," which released a shower of cool water. Others 
bathed at a bank of water faucets. "Crowd-surfers" were passed over the heads 
of the throng. 
</P>
<P>
 T-shirts advertised musical tastes from Nine Inch Nails and Metallica to Bob 
Marley and the Grateful Dead. Some people sat next to signs reading, "I need 
smoke" or "I Need a Dose." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite glitches that left some fans grumbling, authorities reported little 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Friday evening, State Police ordered ticket sales suspended because of 
full parking lots, but promoters scrambled to find other lots and said ticket 
sales would resume. About 125,000 people had arrived by dusk. 
</P>
<P>
 Weekend performers include Joe Cocker, a veteran of the original Woodstock; 
Melissa Etheridge, Aerosmith, Bob Dylan and Peter Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
 Jesse James Dupree, lead singer of the heavy metal band Jackyl, got the show 
off to a rowdy start by lighting a wooden stool on fire, slicing it with a 
chain saw and letting his pants drop to his knees during a song about sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The first concertgoers faced long delays waiting for shuttle buses to take 
them from the parking lots because security bracelets hadn't arrived in time. 
Food concessions were initially closed because special tokens hadn't arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Fans were also confused about where to camp, and tents sprouted like colorful 
mushrooms all over grassy fields of the 850-acre concert site. 
</P>
<P>
 Space already was growing tight by midafternoon. People hacked away brush in 
the woods to clear space for their tents. Foot traffic slowed to a crawl as 
people tried to inch their way through the throngs in front of the main stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands were stuck in a logjam at a narrow bridge over a 15-foot-wide creek. 
People swung hand-over-hand across the scaffolding below the bridge to cross 
the stream, or tried to ford it on shaky logs. Many fell into the 2-foot-deep 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 State police said they were concerned that many fans hadn't been properly 
searched at a concert where booze, drugs and weapons were forbidden, but 
promoter John Scher said security was being tightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a touch disorganized early on, but as time goes on, I think it's 
getting better," said Rick Flaherty of Washington. Flaherty, 40, had brought 
two of his children.

FLORIDA OFFICIALS SALIVATE OVER POTENTIAL FOR TASTY SEA-BORNE CANNONBALLS; 
JELLYFISH: TO COMMERCIAL FISHERMEN AND TO EVERY SWIMMER WHO HAS EVER BEEN STUNG 
BY ONE, THE SOCCER BALL-SIZE CREATURES ARE A PAINFUL, IRRITATING NUISANCE. TO 
OTHERS, THEY ARE POTENTIAL GOLD MINES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From August through December every year, the waters off Panacea, Fla., turn 
into a white-and-purple polka-dot sea as millions of jellyfish the size of 
soccer balls pulsate along this stretch of Gulf of Mexico coast. 
</P>
<P>
 To commercial fishermen such as Leo Lovel of Panacea, and to every swimmer who 
has ever been stung by one, the cannonball jellyfish -- Stomolophus meleagris 
-- are, like jellyfish everywhere, a painful, irritating nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 But to Florida aquaculture officials, the cannonballs are potential 
moneymakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Dried jellyfish are a seasonal delicacy in Southeast Asia. Malaysia alone has 
30 processing plants serving a $30-million industry. Last year Japan spent $35 
million on imported jellyfish; South Korea, $11 million. China exported $20 
million worth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Asians eat species of the tentacled, gelatinous sea creatures that are 
plentiful in waters close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, the Floridians ask, shouldn't the cannonballs, which scientists consider 
one of the most unusual of about 200 jellyfish species, compete as food with 
the Asian varieties? 
</P>
<P>
 Cannonballs have a weaker sting than most other medusae -- the scientific name 
for jellyfish -- making them easier for fishermen to handle. They swim faster 
than others. They are found between Chesapeake Bay and Venezuela and are most 
plentiful in the Gulf of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Most important, their promoters say, dried cannonballs have a crunchy quality 
unmatched by other species. Florida officials are counting on this distinction 
to woo Asian importers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a world-class jellyfish here," boasted Lovel. 
</P>
<P>
 To make a pitch to the huge Asian market, and at the same time help revive 
Florida's beleaguered fishing industry, state officials had a ton of the 
umbrella-like cannonballs hauled in last summer and processed in a laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 The results -- 200 pounds of crunchy, flat pancakes -- were shipped to Japan, 
China and Malaysia and to a few New York-based exporters. 
</P>
<P>
 No orders came through immediately. But last October a wholesale grocer in 
Japan paid $7 a pound for 1,000 pounds of dried cannonballs and indicated he 
would place a multi-ton order later, said Jack Rudloe, who runs a nonprofit 
marine laboratory in Panacea. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudloe was one of the first in the Florida Panhandle fishing community to 
recognize a potential commercial value in the cannonballs. His interest in 
turning them into a marketable product took him to Malaysia, where he studied 
jellyfish processing techniques. 
</P>
<P>
 He is seeking financial support to develop a two-step "jellyfish washing 
machine" that will speed up the cumbersome drying process. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida seafood officials, meanwhile, have requested a $50,000 to $75,000 
grant to pursue jellyfish processing on a larger scale. Legislative approval is 
expected this spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Rudloe and other entrepreneurs hope eventually to turn a profit on 
cannonball sales, Leo Lovel and most other Gulf Coast fishermen simply want the 
jellyfish out of their territory. The large medusae clog and weight down shrimp 
nets, making it difficult to drag in and sort the catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shrimpers are forced to find other areas to work, but there may not be any 
shrimp in those areas," said Charles C. Thomas, head of Florida's Division of 
Seafood and Aquaculture. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other side of the world, however, this bane of Gulf Coast fishermen 
graces any proper banquet table. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has attained a very high status in Asian society," said Samson Hsia, a 
food technologist in Foster City, Calif. "It's a must at Chinese banquets as 
part of the first dish." 
</P>
<P>
 The clear, noodle-like strips, laced with sesame oil and piled next to sea 
cucumbers and turnips, are a far cry from the passive bluish, brownish or 
purplish watery blobs that plague beach goers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 To reach this edible state, jellyfish are cured for a couple of weeks with 
salt and alum, which draw out most of the moisture. The dried disks are soaked 
in fresh water, then cut into strips. Just before serving, the strips are 
dipped in boiling water for a minute or two. 
</P>
<P>
 The final product is "one nonstop proteinate Dorito," said Rudloe. 
</P>
<P>
 Properly prepared jellyfish has a mild fishy flavor and an elastic, crunchy 
texture something like that of an edible rubber band. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides bolstering the profits of local fishermen, U.S. food professionals 
believe a domestic jellyfish industry would appeal to millions of 
diet-conscious Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spend so much money on cutting down the calories of certain foods, and 
jellyfish already comes with no calories," said Peggy Hsieh, a food sciences 
professor at Alabama's Auburn University. It's also high in protein, calcium 
and iron, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite these benefits and a cost comparable to chicken, many food experts 
doubt that Americans will ever accept jellyfish as enthusiastically as they 
have accepted such previously unfamiliar foods as tofu and sushi. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Chinese eat a lot of things only for their texture," said Samson Hsia. 
"This is not true of Americans. There's a textural barrier that most Americans 
won't overcome."

MURDERS ALL DOLLED UP FOR DETECTIVES; EDUCATION: GRAPHIC CRIME SCENES ARE 
DEPICTED WITH TINY PLASTER PEOPLE IN DOLLHOUSES TO TEACH POLICE ABOUT 
CRIME-SOLVING. ALL THEY HAVE TO WORK WITH IS WHAT THEY SEE, ALONG WITH A BIT OF 
WRITTEN INFORMATION.

<P>
 These are dollhouses no child should ever see. 
</P>
<P>
 In one bedroom, a painted plaster man about the size of a finger lies on his 
back in a miniature bed, a shotgun on the floor. The dresser and mirror are 
spattered with blood. 
</P>
<P>
 In a parlor, a woman with yarn hair and a yellow dress lies face down, a tiny 
knife in her left side, her head in a pool of blood and a hammer nearby. A 
package of decomposing meat covered with tiny flies sits on a wooden chair. 
</P>
<P>
 These dollhouses of death have stumped some of the best homicide investigators 
for almost 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a year, about 40 investigators from as far away as Australia and Hong 
Kong come to the state medical examiner's office in Baltimore to try to solve 
the 18 graphic scenes in the wooden, foot-high rooms. All they have to work 
with is what they can see, along with a bit of written information. 
</P>
<P>
 It's called the Nutshell Studies, built in the 1940s by a New Hampshire state 
police captain with a fondness for forensic science. Frances Glessner Lee based 
the scenes on police reports and eyewitness accounts of real murders. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got the details down to the exact date on a wall calendar," said Dr. J. 
Laron Locke, Maryland's assistant medical examiner. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigators are assigned one of the cases at the beginning of their 
weeklong visit and are expected to figure out whodunit by the end. 
</P>
<P>
 Det. Dave Gamble of the prosecutor's office in Monmouth County, N.J., was 
assigned a three-room dollhouse with a man and a woman dead in a bedroom and a 
baby dead in the next room. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, it appeared that someone had broken into the house and killed 
all three. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gamble thought otherwise: "There was gunshot in the kitchen wall," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the husband killed the baby, then his wife, then himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to dig and really look into them," said Officer Charles McCully, a 
homicide investigator for the Metro Dade Police Department in Miami, who 
participated in the May seminar. "You see some of the crazy things that people 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Nutshell Series was once part of Harvard University Medical School's 
Department of Legal Medicine, which Lee endowed. When she died, the department 
was eliminated. The Nutshell Studies moved to Baltimore in the 1960s. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the seminars have grown. They now include lectures on new 
technology, such as DNA testing, and refresher courses on homicide 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The crime solutions are well guarded. But investigators did divulge the clues 
that helped solve the slaying of the man in the bedroom and the woman in the 
parlor. 
</P>
<P>
 The man's wife had claimed that he killed himself, but investigators say it 
was murder because the shotgun lies on the floor, not next to him in bed. 
</P>
<P>
 In the scene with the woman on the floor, it's clear she was kept alive, 
possibly tortured, for a couple of days because the hamburger meat she left out 
has decomposed while her body has not.

BOMBS RAINED ON FLORIDA FAMILY IN 1944; WORLD WAR II: FOUR FAMILY MEMBERS DIED 
WHEN ARMY AIR CORPS PLANE ACCIDENTALLY UNLEASHED ITS MUNITIONS DURING TRAINING 
MISSION. SURVIVORS RECALL THEIR LIVING HELL.

<P>
 The flares went up just about every night during World War II, a prelude to 
the bomb tests at the Air Force base a mile and a half away. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 11, 1944, four stars shooting overhead mimicked the flares. The 
Cossons, gathered in the yard after dinner, heard the familiar drone of a plane 
and then the unbelievable: the whine of bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the night American bombs wiped out four members of one family in this 
Florida Panhandle city. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flares seemed like they were closer this night," said David Cosson, who 
was 12. "My dad looked up and said: 'There's four shooting stars; that's a bad 
sign.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the bombs. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could hear them whistling," cousin Frank Cosson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-pound fragmentation bombs, meant to scatter deadly debris on impact, 
killed Alfred Cosson, brother James and two of James' children, 14-year-old 
James Jr. and 12-year-old Winnie. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred's son, David, and James' sons, Frank and Thomas Cosson, were injured. 
So were James' wife, Annie Belle, and Alfred's wife, Pearl, who have since 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 The blasted house is gone now, the farm turned to forest. A sign posted by 
relatives notes the night's toll. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Cossons who were at ground zero survive today. David, who has endured 
about 100 operations, is paralyzed from the waist down. He lost one leg to 
infection. Thomas joined the Army at 17 to support his mother, then built up a 
construction business. Frank, rejected by the Army, Air Force and Navy because 
of his bomb injuries, was later drafted into the Army and built his career 
there. He retired after he was wounded in Vietnam, coming home blind in one eye 
and deaf in one ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank has made his peace with that 50-year-old loss: "If you go through life 
holding a grudge or hatred against somebody, it just eats you up inside." 
</P>
<P>
 All the same, that night's sights, sounds and smells are still vivid. 
</P>
<P>
 Alfred and Winnie had started running up the dirt road when the first bomb 
exploded between them. At least two more were to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Others raced for the house. James Jr. had gotten to the front door when 
shrapnel hit him between the eyes. "It hit him so hard it knocked his brains up 
on the window," David said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uncle Jim, he made it to the front steps and a piece caught him in the back 
of the head and spun him around three times. And every time he went around 
blood spewed on the porch." 
</P>
<P>
 David was on his uncle's heels when shrapnel hit him in the back of the head. 
He got up and a piece caught him in the back. "I guess it knocked me about 
three somersaults," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine-year-old Frank was on the porch. He was hit in the abdomen. "I can still 
smell the smoke of the bombs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His brother, Thomas, who was 4, remembers something else. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even now I can get the smell of that blood in my nostrils," said Thomas, who 
has a 10-inch shrapnel scar on his side. He'd been lying in bed when the bombs 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
 Winnie lay on David's chest, still breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked over and -- Lord have mercy -- she didn't even have a face," David 
said, his voice cracking. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Army Air Corps officials explained that one plane's release 
mechanism had hung up. Instead of falling three miles inside the Eglin Air 
Force Base reservation, the bombs remained attached until the device unjammed 
over the Cosson homestead, a mile and a half away. 
</P>
<P>
 The military never identified the plane or the pilot. David's nephew, Robert 
Mickler, said a nurse told him years later that the pilot went insane when he 
learned what had happened. 
</P>
<P>
 David, who had to give up his work repairing TVs because his nerves were too 
bad to allow him to hold a soldering iron steady, received $15,000 more in 
1949.

EARTH FEELS CRUNCH OF 5.5 BILLION PEOPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The world population of 5.5 billion is more than twice what the Earth can 
support over the long term, a study says. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Ehrlich of Stanford University and Gretchen Daily of UC Berkeley have 
concluded that the Earth's maximum "carrying capacity" is about 1.5 billion to 
2 billion people. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're unsustainable now," Ehrlich said in an interview last week. "We want to 
reduce the impact so there's hope of getting over the top and bringing the 
population back down." 
</P>
<P>
 The study also said that the world's population would double again before 
efforts to control it take hold. 
</P>
<P>
 The best way to boost the Earth's carrying capacity and to reduce population 
is to promote political and social policies that remove the enormous inequities 
between rich and poor, men and women and industrial and developing countries, 
the researchers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Removing inequities among nations encourages the kind of international 
cooperation needed to control environmental problems, such as global warming, 
that can hinder agricultural production, Ehrlich said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said that women with jobs are less likely to have children. "There's a 
lot of evidence that equity between the sexes can lower the fertility rate," 
Ehrlich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other reforms, such as a fairer distribution of land among farmers in 
developing countries, can help increase the Earth's carrying capacity, Daily 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people own their own land, there's more incentive to pass it on the way 
they got it," rather than to abuse it, Daily said. Land that is well cared for 
can support more people than land that is abused, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Lubchenco of Oregon State University said that Ehrlich and Daily are 
making an important contribution to population research. "What they're doing is 
way ahead of anybody else," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ehrlich and Daily said the recommendation for greater social and political 
equity is based on scientific findings, not their personal political 
philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 The researchers presented their findings at the annual meeting of the 
Ecological Society of America and the American Institute of Biological 
Sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 Ehrlich, author of the groundbreaking 1968 book, "The Population Bomb," said 
that increasing Earth's carrying capacity would require that Americans consume 
less, but could lead to an improvement in their quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 "What if over the next 50 years we redesigned America for people instead of 
cars," he said. "People would walk to work, everyone's health would improve." 
Fuel consumption and pollution would also drop, he said.

TEXAS' LAGUNA MADRE MERITS PROTECTION, CARETAKERS SAY; GULF COAST: VAST 
SALTWATER BAY PROVIDES A HOME FOR MARINE BIRDS; IT'S ALSO WORTH HUNDREDS OF 
MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO THE LOCAL ECONOMY. BUT POLLUTION IS ENCROACHING AND 
LAGOON FACES DESTRUCTION.

 It's a little after sunrise. The shimmering waters of Laguna Madre extend for 
mile after mile of golden ripples. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the Laguna Madre to me, clear and shallow," said Mike Farmer of the 
National Audubon Society. Fish splash around his boat. Bright pink roseate 
spoonbills swoop overhead to feed in nearby wetlands. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Madre, the Mother Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 The saltwater bay, stretching 130 miles down the Gulf Coast, is a vast cradle 
of wildlife between the South Texas mainland and the barrier sands of Padre 
Island. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a rare environment only a few feet deep, where hundreds of marine and 
bird species breed, feed and thrive. It's also worth hundreds of millions of 
dollars to the area economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But, increasingly, scientists say the Laguna Madre is under threat. 
</P>
<P>
 * Underwater meadows of sea grasses -- the core habitat in the food chain -- 
are disappearing at alarming rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * The brown tide, a mysterious algal bloom, is spreading persistently, 
clouding bay waters and perhaps threatening fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Arroyo Colorado, the largest source of freshwater into the Lower Laguna 
Madre, is loaded with pollution that may be feeding the brown tide. 
</P>
<P>
 * Large tracts of wetlands and tidal flats, which provide fishing areas for 
migratory water birds and shorebirds, have been lost to what is called "spoil," 
a dark silt dredged from the bay bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 The Army Corps of Engineers dredges in the Laguna Madre to keep the Gulf 
Intracoastal Waterway open for barge traffic between Corpus Christi and 
Brownsville. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Laguna Madre system has a series of insults coming into it, and to me 
it's at the crossroads right now," said Steve Thompson, manager of Laguna 
Atascosa National Wildlife Refuge, which shares 12 miles of the Lower Laguna 
Madre's eastern shore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we going to continue the insults or slow them down?" 
</P>
<P>
 As Farmer guides his 16-foot boat from the mouth of the Arroyo Colorado into 
the open bay, he points to large tracts of thinly vegetated land that he said 
were once part of the bay's tidal flats. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, both sides of the river mouth have been used to dump dredging 
spoil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even the so-called containment sites erode into the bay," Farmer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Madre is one of only three bays in the world that are hypersaline 
-- meaning saltier than sea water -- but still support abundant wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two productive hypersaline bays are the Mexican Laguna Madre, just 
across the Rio Grande from Texas, and the Sivash, adjacent to the Sea of Azov 
on the Crimean Peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the shallows of the Laguna Madre comprise only one-fifth of the 
Texas coastal bay area, the lagoon accounts for more than half the state's 
catch of commercial fin fish each year. 
</P>
<P>
 The warm waters are rich in such sport fishermen favorites as redfish, black 
drum and spotted sea trout. Robert Ditton at Texas A&M's Department of Wildlife 
and Fisheries estimates that fishing and other tourism activities that depend 
on a healthy Laguna Madre generate at least $400 million a year for the 
regional economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Protected from overdevelopment by Padre Island National Seashore, the Laguna 
Atascosa refuge and the sprawling King and Kenedy ranches, the Laguna Madre is 
the cleanest bay in Texas, and the only one that retains extensive sea grasses. 
</P>
<P>
 "In spite of all the abuse inflicted on the Laguna Madre, it retains an 
amazing regenerative capacity," said Tony Reisinger, marine extension agent for 
Cameron County. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists say the sea grasses provide oxygen and a foundation for the food 
chain, from microorganisms to the largest fish and birds of prey. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Madre contains the world's largest concentration of reddish egrets. It 
provides habitat for endangered piping plovers, peregrine falcons, Kemp's 
ridley sea turtles and an amazing array of shorebirds and Neotropical migratory 
birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the North American population of redhead ducks winter in the Laguna, 
feeding almost exclusively on shoal grass, a species of sea grass. 
</P>
<P>
 The underwater meadows aren't only important to ducks. Sea grasses in Laguna 
Madre estuaries of Texas and Mexico provide crucial nursing habitat for Gulf of 
Mexico shrimp, a $600-million annual crop in Texas alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our policy is to protect every blade of sea grass we can," said Deyaun 
Boudreaux, coastal environmental director for the Texas Shrimp Assn. "We are 
sitting here guarding the last system that has sea grass beds." 
</P>
<P>
 Studies by Christopher Onuf at the National Wetlands Research Center in Corpus 
Christi show a drastic decline in shoal grass: from 82% coverage of the bay 
bottom in 1965 to 33% by 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Manatee grass, which is less nutritious for species such as redhead ducks, has 
replaced much of the shoal grass. 
</P>
<P>
 The main reason for the decline of shoal grass has been the Corps of 
Engineers' practice of dumping spoil directly into the bay, Onuf said. The 
sediment clouds the water, reducing sunlight to underwater plants, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists, shrimpers and fishermen also worry about the brown tide. The 
single-celled algae, which first appeared in Baffin Bay in 1989, has worsened 
each spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The brown tide has been reported as far north as Galveston Bay and as far 
south as the Mexican Laguna Madre, said Ken Dunton, a researcher at the 
University of Texas Marine Science Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "No other algal bloom has ever been recorded for such a long period," Dunton 
warned. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Upper Laguna Madre, light has decreased more than 50% due to the 
shading effects of the brown tide and, consequently, sea grass growth and 
biomass have decreased," Dunton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists believe that if the brown tide continues at its current rate, it 
will eventually harm fish and shellfish stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are certain that the arroyo and everything that's going into it right now 
is feeding the brown tide," said Richard Weldon, vice president of the Valley 
Sportsmen Club, which wants to clean up the Arroyo Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
 The 89-mile arroyo was a main distributary of the Rio Grande before the mighty 
border river was dammed. Today the arroyo is murky and slow-moving, and in many 
stretches smelly. 
</P>
<P>
 It serves as a drainage canal for waste water from more than 20 cities in the 
Lower Rio Grande Valley, where the population is burgeoning and some sewage 
treatment plants are inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arroyo Colorado also carries into the Laguna waste water from 
Taiwanese-owned shrimp farms in Arroyo City and the runoff of pesticides and 
fertilizers from Valley farms. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the arroyo didn't cause the brown tide initially, its nutrient-laden 
waters may be helping the algae spread, Weldon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weldon proposes a series of aerators along the arroyo to increase oxygen and 
offset the buildup of organic matter. His group also is seeking tax dollars for 
settling ponds to help cleanse the water on its way to the Laguna. 
</P>
<P>
 Weldon said he sees the political momentum shifting toward increasing 
protection of the arroyo and the Mother Lagoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The awareness is heightened to a point where it has to change," he said.

 Legislation aimed at doing away with affirmative action programs in 
state-related public employment, public education and the awarding of public 
contracts has been rejected by the Assembly Judiciary Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 A 4-6 vote, three short of the seven votes required for approval, was cast on 
the constitutional amendment (ACA 47) by Assemblyman Bernie Richter (R-Chico), 
who said he plans to reintroduce the proposal next year. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have asked the voters to prohibit the state or any of its political 
subdivisions from using race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin as 
criteria for granting preferential treatment or discriminating against any 
individual or group. 
</P>
<P>
 Richter claimed that affirmative action programs that give preferential 
treatment to minorities have sown the seeds of racial hatred in society. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents argued that abolishing affirmative action programs would do more 
harm than good in promoting harmonious race relations.

NATIONAL PARK ATTENDANCE ON THE DECLINE; RECREATION: DROP IN VISITORS, WHICH 
BEGAN TWO YEARS AGO, IS BAD NEWS FOR BUSINESSES THAT CATER TO TOURISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Is America's love affair with its overcrowded national parks fading? 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since the end of World War II, the number of people 
visiting national parks is heading down, in a decline that started two years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 That spells trouble for businesses that cater to park visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in this desert park of 2,000 natural stone arches, where visitor numbers 
had jumped 51% since 1990, attendance may be down this year, said Park Supt. 
Noel Poe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't believe it could continue forever. Maybe we're at that point," Poe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighboring Canyonlands, where growth had been even higher than Arches, also 
is in a decline. 
</P>
<P>
 But not every park is down. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance at some parks that draw from major population centers is climbing, 
including Yosemite, up 9%, and Rocky Mountain near Denver, up 17% for the first 
five months of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But, nationally, visitors to the park system's 332 reporting units, ranging 
from parks to battlefields, were down 2.2% through May and initial reports for 
June and July suggest further drops. Last year, visits were down to 273.1 
million, down from the previous year's 274.7 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1947, the number was 25.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Many reasons are given why park system numbers are down, ranging from an 
uncertain world economy to the international attraction of all the World Cup 
soccer matches to overcrowding of the parks themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are tired of going to overcrowded parks," said Rod Greenough of the 
Salt Lake City office of the National Parks and Conservation Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But some businesses believe measures imposed to control crowds, such as 
reservation systems, have also discouraged visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It appears that in preparing for the overcrowding of past years, the Park 
Service may have actually done its job a little too well," said Brenda Tormo, 
president of the Grand Canyon Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 Suzanne Cook, an economist with the U.S. Travel Data Center in Washington, 
said domestic travel business data would suggest park visits should be up. 
</P>
<P>
 "The indicators that I have, like lodging data, are up 4.2% this year," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook said the parks' decline also may be a sign of the changing tastes of baby 
boomers. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't expect this slight attendance decline to eliminate long waits for 
parking places and camping spots. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's a reprieve, it's not much of one, say Greenough and officials at 
several parks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd compare it to a prisoner of war getting a glass of water thrown in his 
face," said Ken Hornbeck, who assembles and analyzes visit numbers for the Park 
Service. 
</P>
<P>
 And it doesn't mean outdoor recreation is down on all the nation's public 
lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Recreation consumers just have more choices, including travel to millions of 
acres of less-crowded public lands administered by the Bureau of Land 
Management or U.S. Forest Service. Neither agency keeps close tabs on visitor 
numbers.

 The students gather outside their classroom door and chant an ancient Hawaiian 
poem: "Ku mai nei au i ka halau loa a 'i."  
</P>
<P>
 They respectfully tell their teacher of their desire for learning and ask for 
permission to enter the place of instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 The teacher answers, "Au mai e na Lehua a," or "Come forth, my young Lehua 
blossoms," and the eager students file into the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 This scene repeats itself each school-day morning at seven public schools 
across Hawaii where hundreds of elementary schoolchildren are taught 
exclusively through the Hawaiian language. 
</P>
<P>
 The program began 10 years ago when a group of native Hawaiian parents saw 
their language disappearing as older speakers died, and they looked to the next 
generation to revive it. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents started their own preschool in Hilo, on Hawaii Island, where their 
children would be taught exclusively in Hawaiian. They called it Punana Leo, or 
nest of language. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not just teaching them Hawaiian; we're teaching them through Hawaiian," 
said Kauanoe Kamana, a Hawaiian studies professor at the University of Hawaii 
at Hilo, and one of the original parents involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who think English is the key to all success are very narrow-minded," 
she said. "You need to know English, but it is not the essence of all 
knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been educated using the English language for the past 100 years and it 
has not improved our academic performance as a people." 
</P>
<P>
 Children of Hawaiian ancestry routinely score the lowest on standard tests 
among all other ethnic groups in the Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, volunteer teachers and parents instructed the classes using donated 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 They later won the support and financial backing of the state Department of 
Education, which gradually established Hawaiian language immersion programs 
through the eighth grade in seven public schools around the state. 
</P>
<P>
 About 1,000 students are registered for the immersion classes for the fall and 
the Department of Education recently approved extending the program through 
high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle that our children now are speaking the Hawaiian language," 
said Lilikala Kame'eleihiwa, whose 11-year-old daughter, Punihei, has attended 
a Hawaiian immersion school in Honolulu since preschool. 
</P>
<P>
 Hearing Punihei speak the language she thought would one day be lost "makes my 
heart sing," Kame'eleihiwa said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the program's inception, some lawmakers and educators questioned the value 
of an education through Hawaiian where English is taught an hour each day as a 
second language. 
</P>
<P>
 They feared the students would lag behind their counterparts in writing and 
articulating in English. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hawaii School Supt. Herman Aizawa said the students in the all-Hawaiian 
classes are performing as well or better than students in the same grade level 
taught in English. 
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Education evaluates a test class of Hawaiian language 
immersion students each year in basic core areas such as reading, comprehension 
and mathematics, said administrator Anita Bruce. 
</P>
<P>
 The evaluations show that the students have kept pace with their 
English-schooled counterparts, Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of recent Stanford Achievement Tests taken by sixth-graders who have 
participated in Hawaiian language immersion since preschool point to a reversal 
in the trend of lower-than-average test scores for native Hawaiians. 
</P>
<P>
 According to results of the tests administered last year to sixth-graders at 
Keaukaha Elementary School, 100% of the Hawaiian-educated students scored 
average or above on the math portion while only 66% of the students in 
all-English classes scored as well. 
</P>
<P>
 For the reading portion of the test, 66% of Hawaiian-educated students scored 
average or above, compared to 52% of the English-educated students. 
</P>
<P>
 Aizawa says the success of the program can be attributed to the strong 
commitment and involvement of the parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the students get the support of the parents at home -- it does not matter 
what school they go to -- they will be successful," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawaiian language is worked into the curriculum of other public school 
students through kupunas, or Hawaiian community elders who spend a few hours a 
week in the classroom sharing their language and culture with students. 
</P>
<P>
 The revival of the Hawaiian language has not been confined to the state's 
elementary schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Enrollment in Hawaiian language and culture classes at the University of 
Hawaii's main campus in Honolulu has risen to nearly 1,700 students from just 
700 five years ago, with hundreds of others on a waiting list, said Emily 
Hawkins, department chairwoman for Hawaiian language. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawaiian language immersion program in the elementary schools is partly 
responsible for the large increase, Hawkins said, because graduates in Hawaiian 
language and studies are finding jobs teaching Hawaiian in the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the largest interest in learning the language can be seen in the general 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people are coming to Hawaiian studies as a way to keep up with their 
culture," Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a decade ago, only about 1,000 people, mostly historians and elders, 
spoke Hawaiian fluently. 
</P>
<P>
 Today that number has more than doubled in the wake of a cultural revival that 
has touched young and old alike. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's my language, the language of my ancestors, my culture; if nobody 
continues it we'll lose it forever," said Hiapo Perreira, a 19-year-old major 
in Hawaiian studies at the University of Hawaii. He is one-fourth Hawaiian on 
his mother's side. 
</P>
<P>
 When Perreira's mother was in school, students were punished for speaking 
Hawaiian in the classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 About 20% of Hawaii's population can claim some Hawaiian ancestry. In 1979, 
Hawaiian was declared the state's official language, along with English. 
</P>
<P>
 A state law established in 1896, three years after white business leaders 
overthrew the Hawaiian monarchy, prohibited speaking Hawaiian in the schools. 
It was not overturned until 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins says the students may have some or no Hawaiian blood but they all 
"think of themselves as tied to this place, to its beaches, its mountains, 
whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The state's Office of Hawaiian Affairs produced a television commercial 
showing people of all ages speaking Hawaiian, with English subtitles, 
encouraging viewers to learn the language. 
</P>
<P>
 The commercial generated more than 300 requests for information about how to 
sign up for classes, said OHA culture specialist Pikake Pelekai. 
</P>
<P>
 When a Honolulu public radio station began broadcasting a daily newscast in 
Hawaiian, even listeners who did not understand the language tuned in because 
they liked the way spoken Hawaiian sounded, said the station's news director, 
Scott Kim. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaiian comes from the same Polynesian ancestral language as the native 
languages of Tahiti and New Zealand, said Hawaiian language professor Pila 
Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very melodious language that uses only seven consonants and five 
vowels in making all of its words," Wilson said.

 The 19-year-old son of a firefighter was charged with setting a forest fire 
that forced evacuation of thousands of residents in southeastern British 
Columbia, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Kraiger was taken into custody and charged in provincial court with one 
count of arson related to the blaze near the resort community of Penticton east 
of Vancouver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire started July 20 and burned out of control for more than 2 weeks. It 
ravaged 13,600 acres, destroyed 18 homes and forced the evacuation of nearly 
3,000 residents.

FEDS TARGET SOFTWARE EXPERT WHO DEVELOPED CODE TO ENCRYPT DATA; COMPUTERS: 
AMONG SOME CIVIL LIBERTARIANS, PHILLIP ZIMMERMAN HAS ACHIEVED A KIND OF 
CULT-HERO STATUS IN THE GROWING DEBATE OVER ELECTRONIC-PRIVACY ISSUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 To some civil libertarians, Phillip Zimmerman is a hero. To the government, he 
is a suspect. To one corporation, he is a flouter of patents. 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible, in fact, that this self-employed computer software consultant 
is all these things; on the Information Highway, the distinctions blur. What is 
clear is that Zimmerman is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 This is what Zimmerman did: 
</P>
<P>
 He developed a program -- Pretty Good Privacy, or PGP -- which encrypts 
electronic files in a virtually unbreakable code. He gave PGP to a friend. The 
friend made it available on the worldwide network of computer systems. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, he has been targeted in a federal criminal investigation to 
determine whether he violated a law prohibiting the export of encryption 
software. And he has run afoul of RSA Data Security Inc., which owns a patent 
on the mathematical algorithm used in PGP. 
</P>
<P>
 But among civil libertarians, Zimmerman has achieved a kind of cult-hero 
status in the growing debate over electronic privacy issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two hundred years ago when they wrote the Constitution, they never thought it 
was necessary to put a special amendment in the Bill of Rights for the right to 
have a private conversation. You would just go out behind the barn and talk," 
Zimmerman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But today, you have copper wires and glass fibers carrying our conversations. 
So, do we want to sacrifice our privacy because of that? Our civil liberties 
are eroding because of the Information Age. Cryptography will bring them back." 
</P>
<P>
 There are hundreds of computer software programs like PGP that encrypt 
communications. Most are based on a "public-key" technology: Users are given a 
widely distributed "public key" and one the user keeps confidential. The 
technology allows a message encoded with a user's public key only to be decoded 
by the private key. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys, financial consultants and others in business use PGP to protect 
documents and electronic mail. Human rights activists in some Third World 
countries use it to encode data about government tyranny, said Daniel Salcedo 
of the American Assn. for the Advancement of Science. 
</P>
<P>
 But Zimmerman said he has heard of a case in which a man later convicted of 
child molestation used it to keep some documents secret. 
</P>
<P>
 That irks law enforcement authorities, who say encryption prevents police from 
monitoring illegal activities, from drug networks to terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution to the police dilemma is the Clinton Administration's proposed 
"clipper chip." It would scramble computer or telephone communications, but the 
government would retain a set of decoding keys to enable court-approved 
electronic surveillance. Manufacturers would be asked to voluntarily install 
the chip in their products. 
</P>
<P>
 Civil libertarians and most computer industry officials oppose Clinton's 
proposal, and Vice President Al Gore has indicated that the Administration is 
willing to compromise. Without secure encryption, Zimmerman says, the 
government could theoretically set up computers to scan networks for subversive 
words -- sort of a high-tech "drift-net fishing." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the "clipper chip" is just a proposal. And the federal government is 
trying to rein in programs like PGP -- an effort akin to picking up a bead of 
mercury with your bare hands. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, two years after Zimmerman finished PGP, he was informed of a federal 
investigation into its transmission overseas, said Boulder attorney Phillip 
DuBois, who represents Zimmerman. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors in San Jose, Calif., who are spearheading the probe, 
declined comment. If Zimmerman were to be indicted and convicted of the export 
law violation, he could receive up to 51 months in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a situation in which the law has not kept pace with technology," said 
DuBois. "I personally don't see that Mr. Zimmerman committed any federal, state 
or any other kind of felony or misdemeanor or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerman points out that PGP could be legally exported overseas if it were 
published in a book instead of sent electronically. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like dandelion seeds blowing in the wind; you can't contain biology and 
you can't contain information," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerman also has run into problems with RSA Data Security. Zimmerman didn't 
sell the software initially; he advised users to get a patent license from RSA. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerman later reached agreement with ViaCrypt of Phoenix to sell a 
commercial version of PGP. ViaCrypt has a license from RSA. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Bidzos of RSA called Zimmerman's actions "spineless," but declined to say 
if he is considering legal action. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been so many violations of that patent through the distribution of 
PGP. . . . My only comment would be, let the user beware," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zimmerman is undeterred by any threat. A fervent believer in civil liberties, 
Zimmerman was a peace activist in the 1980s, an acolyte of Daniel Ellsberg, 
leaker of the Pentagon Papers. He once was arrested with Ellsberg and Carl 
Sagan while protesting in Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he's working on an encryption program for real-time voice communications 
using multimedia computers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phil is just a guy who did a neat thing," said Stephen Walker, president of 
Trusted Information Systems Inc. of Glenwood, Md., which specializes in 
computer security. "He built a piece of software that somehow got overseas and 
they are using him as a scapegoat."

 RETIREMENT A BAD WORD IN PORTUGUESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID KLIGMAN, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 30 years after she began her career as a radio announcer, 
80-year-old Adeline Idalina Mello is contemplating retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 It's making her co-workers nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever Mello talks about quitting her volunteer job at KTPB-FM, the 
station's other employees pretend they're not listening and change the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of our listeners listen because of her," said Mary Serpa, the 
closed-circuit station's general manager. "Anything we need to know, we go to 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 And when the listeners don't hear Mello, they also get nervous. During one 
recent stretch on the air, Mello was tied up on a lengthy long-distance call, 
which prompted a frantic call from a teen-age boy who only heard music from the 
station. He wondered if anything had happened to her. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so relieved," Mello said. "He said, 'My grandmother was so worried 
about you.' I didn't think people cared." 
</P>
<P>
 Mello is on the air three hours a day on weekdays at KTPB, which station 
President Ralph Alves said is the country's only 24-hour all-Portuguese radio 
station. On Sundays, Mello has her own 4 1/2-hour radio show, "Aurora of 
Portugal." 
</P>
<P>
 The station's other announcers broadcast Portuguese music, live soccer games 
from Portugal and Catholic prayers. Mello does that, but what draws listeners 
to her shows is the local information she passes along: birthdays, 
anniversaries, obituaries, even job openings. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a throwback to the days when radio was often the main source of 
information for people who couldn't read newspapers. Even today, many of the 
station's 10,000 listeners from Gorman to Merced rely on Mello for news, Serpa 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello also translates items directly from the Fresno Bee, including the Dear 
Abby advice column, into Portuguese. Listeners then call in over the air and 
give their opinions of the news to Mello, who adds her own comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I feel I have to say something, I will," said Mello, whose mother didn't 
let her go to school past the seventh grade. Still, Mello received a special 
degree and taught English and the U.S. Constitution to adult classes for 32 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello was born in Portugal, but her family moved to New Bedford, Mass., when 
she was an infant. When Mello was 16, she moved to Hanford. Since 1930 she has 
lived in Tulare, where there is a large Portuguese population. 
</P>
<P>
 Mello, who is also the station's bookkeeper, began broadcasting 32 years ago 
as a favor to a friend who owned Tulare-based KGEN, now KBOS. She has been 
working for five years at KTPB. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of her close ties to her co-workers, Mello has delayed retiring, even 
though she insists the time is near.

SHAKESPEARE FESTIVAL PROVES MORE THAN A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM; OREGON: 
ASHLAND'S 1993 SEASON SPANNED EIGHT MONTHS, WITH 733 PERFORMANCES OF 11 PLAYS 
IN THREE DIFFERENT LOCALES DRAWING 350,000 PEOPLE TO THE BIGGEST REGIONAL 
THEATER IN THE NATION. THIS YEAR'S FESTIVAL BEGAN LAST MONTH. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Oregon Shakespeare Festival has grown into one of the nation's premier 
regional theaters, this community of 16,000 residents has struggled against a 
tendency to let the stage overrun the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 There are motels, to be sure, with names like The Bard's Inn. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Main Street, standing out starkly among Shakespeare banners and 
boutiques, is Harrison's Parts, an auto parts and machine shop with oil-stained 
wood floors, and fan belts and radiator hoses hanging from the ceiling. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that there has been a conscious decision on the part of 
Ashlanders to not be Disneyland, to not be a theme park," said Mayor Cathy 
Golden. "What's happened is the theater has grown with Ashland. It has matured 
with the community. They've grown both individually and in parallel ways that 
complement each other. It's the secret of success of both the theater and the 
town." 
</P>
<P>
 Ashland was founded by Ohio farmers in 1873 in the foothills of the rugged 
Siskiyou Mountains. Early on, residents had visions of a resort and developed 
the local mineral springs, whose sulfurous charms still can be sampled from 
lithia water drinking fountains downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1935, a teacher at the local college, Angus Bowmer, started the town on a 
journey to the place it has become. 
</P>
<P>
 With a group of students and friends, Bowmer put on the festival's first plays 
during the Fourth of July weekend. Convinced that the plays would be a bust, 
the town fathers demanded that boxing matches be held during the intermissions 
to make sure tickets would sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The boxing matches are long gone, but the plays have grown in recognition each 
year. The company won a Tony award in 1983 for outstanding achievement in 
regional theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's big break came in 1964, Shakespeare's 400th anniversary, when 
it took three plays to Stanford University, where they were reviewed by critic 
Richard Coe of the Washington Post. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Theater Critics Assn. brought its 1985 convention to Ashland, 
helping to celebrate the festival's 50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the festival's season spanned eight months, with 733 performances 
of 11 plays in three different theaters drawing 350,000 people, making it the 
biggest regional theater in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 One follower, Kristin Kraus, actually likes getting up at 5 a.m. to stand 
outside the box office for extra tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "It becomes this little community," said Kraus, 29, who has been coming to the 
festival since she was 12. "You end up talking about your whole life history to 
complete strangers. It's really embarrassing, but that's OK, because there's 
nothing real about it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah," said her friend, Denise Mauro. "It's like this fictitious land." 
</P>
<P>
 Both local merchants and the festival have resisted becoming a Shakespeare 
fantasyland, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheila Drescher, a partner in the Bloomsbury Books shop and a member of the 
festival's board of directors, remembers a time about 15 years ago when there 
was a restaurant called Hamlet's Roost and a shop called As You Like It. 
</P>
<P>
 A Tudor facade showed up on a prominent wall of one of the buildings on Main 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so cutesy," she said. "People were against it." 
</P>
<P>
 But the facade gradually has come down. Now only one panel of white stucco and 
dark brown timbers survives as a kind of a reminder of what could have been. 
</P>
<P>
 The 500-member company has remained committed to performing the complete works 
of Shakespeare, as well as controversial modern pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't do plays on the stage in an English accent," said Pat Patton, 
assistant artistic director. "It's not a theme park. It's a serious artistic 
endeavor." 
</P>
<P>
 Politically, Ashland stands out as a liberal enclave in conservative southern 
Oregon. Voters rejected an anti-homosexual measure by 3-1, although it won wide 
support elsewhere in rural Oregon. The statewide measure was defeated in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ashland has a nice mix of that small-town feel and the benefits of a city," 
said Katrina Seibert, manager of the Winchester Inn bed and breakfast. "People 
are more artistic and less geared to career. I think most people are here 
because they like living here and they are finding a way to make it work." 
</P>
<P>
 One way people make it work is by starting other theaters. Four have spun off 
the festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, Shakespeare is the draw, and Shakespeare is what created the 
theater energy in the town," said Jim Giancarlo, a former Shakespeare Festival 
dancer who started Oregon Cabaret Theater in a converted church. "It's the 
theater, but it's also the town." 
</P>
<P>
 Golden traces much of Ashland's appeal to voter decisions to control strip 
development, support schools, make the town pedestrian-friendly, promote 
bicycle riding and boost recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 But above it all hovers Shakespeare, especially for visitors. Ask parking 
patrol officer Matt Caswell as he leaves yellow chalk marks on the tires of 
cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest question I'm asked falls between where the Shakespeare box office 
is and where is the best place to eat," he said.

DON'T TIE HANDS OF AIR BASE DEVELOPER; INITIATIVE ON EL TORO'S FUTURE SHOULD BE 
DEFEATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A lot of interest has been stirred over the disclosure that the Irvine Co. has 
been talking about a land swap with the federal government for the El Toro 
Marine Corps Air Station. With all the controversy, it would be unsurprising if 
many simply wished a very complicated problem would go away. 
</P>
<P>
 There is great uncertainty about what will become of the base, and the Irvine 
Co. if nothing else is a known quantity. A binding initiative that would commit 
the county to only a commercial airport has been put on the November ballot by 
a breathless group of high-rolling developers who want to force the issue down 
on their side. Last month, a coalition of South County cities revealed so 
little confidence in the overall planning that it decided to do its own study 
on the environmental and economic impact of an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Against this contentious backdrop, the Irvine Co. negotiations may seem like a 
breath of fresh air. There is ample evidence all around the base of how the 
company goes about developing communities. The land used to be in its portfolio 
and would be there today anyway were it not for one of those "deals" from Uncle 
Sam decades ago that one simply does not refuse.  
</P>
<P>
 While many have their quarrels with the way the Irvine Co. has appeared at 
times to dominate politics in the city that bears part of its name, this is a 
developer with a track record. It would be getting a huge swath of land about 
which there is a great deal of anxiety. In exchange, it would give the federal 
government a substantial portion of open space in the Cleveland National Forest 
area, an area that environmentalists are particularly interested in preserving. 
</P>
<P>
 But while there are favorable currents in the wind, we must remember that if 
such a trade were consummated, the base again would be private property with 
only the county Planning Department to look out for the public interest. Such a 
trade clearly would be a good deal for the Irvine Co. The developer would be 
giving up many acres of terrain that would be hard to develop in exchange for 
prime land. And if it wants an airport, it's a great deal for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Essentially, the Irvine Co. would be approaching the same set of questions 
that now face the authority charged with planning the future of the base. And 
federal officials have stressed that the plan would need agreement from the 
community. All of which brings us back to the current planning process, which 
is set in place and is going on despite all the distractions.  
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, it is impossible to make an informed decision on the Irvine Co. 
swap, or any other particular proposal, until the reuse committee has had the 
chance to do its work and to lay out alternatives for the community at large to 
examine. The Irvine Co. swap would be a good thing if it produced a similar end 
result of sound planning, akin to that of the county planning group. But it 
could be a bad thing if better uses for the base could be found than those 
decided by the developer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, there are few definite answers. But one thing that the proposed 
land swap should not change is the outcome of the vote on an airport. There is 
an additional reason now to turn it down because the Irvine Co. should not have 
its hands tied on exploring options for the land any more than the county 
should. 
</P>
<P>
 For now, it's nice to have an attractive-sounding proposal on the table. But 
there are many questions yet to be answered and those at the planning table 
should not throw in their cards just yet.

THAT'S NO WAY TO REWARD A BRAVE ACT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The story regarding a customer firing at a bank robber ("Customer, Fleeing 
Bank Robber Exchange Gunfire," Aug. 6) illustrates clearly why crime is 
evident. 
</P>
<P>
 A brave citizen acts against an armed criminal who has just committed a felony 
and for his good deed and courage is arrested and charged with three crimes: 
carrying a concealed weapon, discharging a firearm, and delaying the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 If eventually acquitted, he will probably be in hock to the legal profession 
for a couple of years' pay. 
</P>
<P>
 California's laws are a marvelous protection for the criminal. Many folks who 
have the courage to risk their lives by acting against crime are deterred by 
the near certainty of losing their savings and quite possibly homes and jobs 
through the action of our legal systems.

LAGUNA CALLS FOR ACTION ON WATER QUALITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I would like to compliment The Times for its editorial ("Getting to the 
Source of the Problem," July 31), which called attention to the need for action 
to improve the water in Aliso Creek. Your help with this effort is much 
appreciated. 
</P>
<P>
 I would like to clarify that all five members of the Laguna Beach City Council 
have asked for public hearings before the Aliso Water Management Agency. Three 
of the five council members actually attended the meeting of that board, but 
the council was unanimous in its endorsement of action to correct the problems 
that have led to sewer spills, which have polluted the creek and the ocean at 
Aliso Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last several years, the city of Laguna Beach has itself taken numerous 
steps to enhance water quality and protect the marine environment along the 
coast. 
</P>
<P>
 We hope that all public agencies that are involved with ocean water quality 
can work together to enhance this resource for the benefit of all of our 
constituents.

RIDING A WAVE OF CONCERN ABOUT BEACH; SURFERS PUSH AN ENVIRONMENTAL, SEA-FRONT 
RESTORATION PROJECT FOR SAN JUAN CREEK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some of the most imaginative ideas about being kind to the waterfront have 
come from the beach up. Through their concern for the quality of ocean water, 
surfers who are tired of filthy water and beach closures have been 
demonstrating that there is a touch of the reform impulse to be found in their 
romantic lifestyles. 
</P>
<P>
 One such example is in Dana Point, where the mouth of San Juan Creek, now a 
concrete-lined path for rainwater that also collects debris, is being targeted 
for restoration. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal is to return the area to its earlier state as a wetland so that it 
could host wildlife, fish and water grasses. The state Department of Fish and 
Game has been impressed sufficiently with the lobbying effort and with the 
imagination of the Doheny Longboard Surfing Assn.'s Blue Water Task Force that 
some state representatives have begun to help find money for some of the work.  
</P>
<P>
 The plan would remove the concrete walls and eventually involve a series of 
locks upstream to handle water flow, while widening the mouth.  
</P>
<P>
 Scott Jenkins, an oceanographer at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La 
Jolla, who has worked on the plan, suggests that the successful completion of 
the project eventually could stand as a prototype for others to follow around 
the nation.  
</P>
<P>
 The surfers already have done important work by monitoring the ocean water at 
Doheny with help from Surfrider Foundation, and there is the possibility of 
funding for the project's projected costs, now at $6 million to $10 million, 
from the Port of Long Beach, which is looking to pay for restoration projects 
in exchange for credit on wetlands it may endanger through expansion. 
</P>
<P>
 The restoration of an important wetlands area in this region would be 
exciting. The surfers and others are showing the importance of taking a direct 
grass-roots interest in the quality of water and quality of life along the 
waterfront.

OFFERING THANKS FOR A 'NIGHT OUT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * You had to be there to see the spectacular display of service units that 
"protect and serve" the Orange County citizenry. It was all there July 30 at 
the Ortega Shopping Center in San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 This event was a prelude to the Aug. 2 tri-city 11th Annual National Night Out 
that (was) held throughout the United States. National Night Out is designed to 
heighten crime and drug prevention awareness, generate support for 
participation in local anti-crime programs, strengthen neighborhood spirit and 
police-community relations and send a message to criminals letting them know 
that neighborhoods are organized and fighting back. 
</P>
<P>
 Agencies that supported this community awareness must be highly commended for 
their effort and dedication in bringing to the public an overview of available 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 Events of this magnitude don't just happen. It was partially due to the team 
effort of San Juan Capistrano, San Clemente and Dana Point to bring residents 
an awareness program that should be repeated next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations to all those that did a remarkable job in making this a 
success.

CITIZENS SEEKING STRONGER VOICE

<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am responding to a letter ("Possible Jail Expansion," Aug. 2).Other cities 
are experiencing lack of control over their community. 
</P>
<P>
 We, the citizens of Buena Park, urged our City Council to give us a "right to 
vote" on putting our Fire Department under the county's regionalization; we 
were flatly denied the constitutional right. Consequently, Buena Park lost its 
Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, some citizens here in Buena Park have ordered a committee 
called Voters in Action (VIA) to initiate a referendum to correct some of the 
inadequacies in local government. Other cities have formed similar committees. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a start in the right direction.

THE LEGAL SYSTEM'S DOUBLE STANDARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your article, "Attack at Party Probed as Hate Crime," (Aug. 9) was discussed 
the next day at Los Amigos of Orange County.  
</P>
<P>
 Ours is a cross-section of Latino community leaders that has met weekly since 
1978. We were appalled to learn of the brutal Portola Hills ambush, Aug. 5, 
that put 15-year-old Ruben Vaughan in Mission Hospital Regional Medical Center 
with a broken nose and jaw, a five-inch gash on his left cheek and stab wounds 
to his lower back and left knee. It is reported that a gang of 20 to 30 young 
men witnessed and/or participated in this setup for mayhem. It might have 
turned into murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Will (the) Orange County district attorney take the unusual step of personally 
signing complaints charging each person in this gang with felonious conspiracy 
to commit aggravated assault? Will the surgeon who crusades against youth 
violence release to the media an X-ray of the trauma to Ruben Vaughan's face 
and the metal plate now inserted in it? Will local newspapers run pictures of 
suspects in courtroom cages? Will the local assemblyman, running for 
reelection, press for laws that would forever bar the return of any suspect 
(even if acquitted) to his school?  
</P>
<P>
 Such things happen in Orange County, but they are unlikely to in this case.  
</P>
<P>
 On another Friday night (Oct. 15, 1993), two groups of students had an 
unplanned fateful encounter in a South County beach parking lot. No one lured 
anyone anywhere. One group saw themselves as fleeing. The other thought they 
were about to be run down and threw whatever they could put hands on. In a 
one-in-a-million moving shot, a paint roller-rod speared through an ear into a 
young man's brain. One of the first lawmen on the scene classified it as a 
"fluke" and said it was a case of "being at the wrong place at the wrong time." 
His views were howled down by vengeance-seekers. The D.A.'s office filed murder 
charges against six young men. The crusading surgeon released the horrific head 
X-ray to the media. Suspects were photographed in courtroom cages or full-color 
in jailhouse orange. The local assemblyman proclaimed that he backed 
legislation that would forbid their return to their school, whatever the 
outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 In the present instance, Ruben Vaughan is African American. In the earlier and 
continuing case, young men charged with murder are Latinos. If you thought 
justice was color-blind, you might be surprised how orange it can be in this 
county.

ON CHILD SAFETY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * A potentially fatal flaw is cited in The Times' editorial (July 17), 
"Uniform Pool-Safety Code Needed to Protect Toddlers."A coalition of parents 
and health care providers claim " . . . that parents cannot count on monitoring 
their children's whereabouts to protect them from drowning." 
</P>
<P>
 Every day children suffer accidents in kitchens, garages and medicine cabinets 
because they are not properly supervised. Government codes requiring homeowners 
to pay to install even more fencing around their swimming pools will just give 
more false security to the adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Children's accidents happen when backs are turned. The only code that will 
ever save lives is vigilant adult supervision .

 * We simply won't accept the B+ rating on the San Onofre Nuclear Generating 
Station ("NRC Gives San Onofre an A-/B+ Rating," Aug 9). We want an immediate 
investigation to determine how Southern California Edison can bring its plant 
up to an A rating. 
</P>

<P>
 * Re: "Early San Onofre Closure Endorsed," (July 8): Laguna Beach, on a 3-2 
vote by the council, has endorsed the early closure of the San Onofre nuclear 
plant. It happens to have been a wise decision from various standpoints, not 
the least of which has been an inadequate evacuation plan should there be a 
critical event at the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 We citizens of San Clemente are well aware of the defective evacuation plan 
since we live "next door" to the plant. We were deprived of the second leg of 
the evacuation route because of a landslide that closed a portion of Pacific 
Coast Highway/El Camino Real. Also, the plan has changed without public input 
-- namely that we remain at home if an event occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the economics of maintaining Units 2 and 3, it is unlikely that the 
units will pay for themselves in the near future. According to the Southern 
California Edison representative, the units continue to be debt financed and 
the initial construction of the units remains in debt. It is cheaper to borrow 
funds than to live within the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The basic argument to the Public Utilities Commission by Southern California 
Edison will be to continue operations until 2013 by presenting a solid 
three-year budget. Little known is that Southern California Edison will be 
prepared to relicense the units past 2013.

 How often has each of us, when driving, seen the nitwit ahead or next to us

 In the last year I have witnessed this crime occurring at signals immediately 
ahead of patrol units with the officer observing.When I asked a Newport police 
officer (he was a smoker) why the law on this matter is not enforced, he said 
it's because "everyone does it." 
</P>
<P>
 So this rationale makes this act and all its possible consequences OK?

 It is time for this law to be enforced, whether the imbecile tossing the 
cigarette has done so during a drought or a deluge.

ANAHEIM STADIUM CRITICS ARE OFF BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I can't believe that an otherwise intelligent newspaper has been taken in by 
the drivel being peddled by the California Angels' management that "Anaheim 
Stadium Is Sadly Out of Date" (Editorial, July 31) and that the "City, Angels 
Should Think About a Replacement." 
</P>
<P>
 Get real! Other than Baltimore, Cleveland and Arlington, Tex., how many other 
major-league ballparks are newer, cleaner and more functional than the Big A? 
</P>
<P>
 Even Dodger Stadium is older, and you don't hear the Dodgers whining about 
their ballpark being "out of date." 
</P>
<P>
 You say that the stadium is "mocked as an example of the 'concrete doughnut' 
style of stadium architecture." 
</P>
<P>
 Mocked by whom? Certainly not the fans. All we want is a competitive team to 
play there. 
</P>
<P>
 You also complain that "the acres of empty seats become a depressing sight," 
because the Angels are only drawing 20,000 fans per game. Now whose fault is 
that? Again, if the team were playing better, the problem would go away. I 
don't remember a lot of empty seats at the playoffs in 1982 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, your editorial seems to admit that the insufferable play of the 
team is the real problem. 
</P>
<P>
 But then you jump to the conclusion that even if attendance improved, "both 
sides would be right to consider a major renovation of the current stadium." 
Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, but your whole premise doesn't wash.

INTRAPARTY SQUABBLES AID GOP RIVALS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Over the past few weeks The Times Orange County has put forth a number of 
articles highlighting a simmering divisiveness within the Republican Party. 
Your article on 70th Assembly District Republican nominee Marilyn Brewer ("GOP 
Candidate Has Foes in Her Own Party," July 31) follows this trend and continues 
to worry me about the party's prospects in 1994 and 1996.The squabbles come 
about at the worst possible time because, thanks to the President, we have a 
golden opportunity to take control of both the state Legislature and Congress 
within the next two election cycles. 
</P>
<P>
 But our chances are slim if the Rev. Lou Sheldon (of Anaheim's Traditional 
Values Coalition) and friends maintain their assault on our backsides. For just 
as we've nominated a team of very strong pro-business, tough-on-crime slate of 
candidates for both legislative and statewide office, like Brewer, they're 
being attacked from within for reasons that appeal only to a microsample of the 
electorate. The rest of us would much rather live in peace with "less 
government" in all aspects of our lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Get thee behind the party, Lou, and start using your valuable time watching 
the other side's votes, not Brewer's. 
</P>
<P>

 * Kudos to Assembly candidate Marilyn Brewer for sticking to her convictions 
on what are true conservative Republican principles -- lower taxes, fewer 
regulations, and less government interference in our lives. 
</P>

 If her legislative agenda is dominated by such themes, I have no doubt that 
the "silent majority" of rational Republicans in the 70th Assembly District 
will quite happily reelect her time and time again.

WESTSIDE WATCH: DOING TENNESSEE TWO-STEP WITH CALIFORNIA CHARM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hollywood glamour and showmanship go a long way -- even in Nashville. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Black Velvet Smooth Steppin' Showdown in Nashville, Tenn., both first 
and second prize in the national two-step dancing contest went to California 
couples. 
</P>
<P>
 Westside residents Armando Abarca and Christine Ionnone won the Monday 
contest's grand prize: two enormous silver belt buckles and a guest appearance 
on country-Western singer Tanya Tucker's newest video. Second prize went to Ed 
Applegate and Tina Bright of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Abarca, 30, and Ionnone, 27, met two years ago at Denim & Diamonds nightclub 
in Santa Monica, where they hone their two-steppin' skills. They began dancing 
together, but to Ionnone's dismay, Abarca seemed to have two left feet. And so 
the lessons began, love blossomed and within a year, the pair bloomed into the 
hottest amateur country-Western dance couple west of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 But the question remains: How in the world did the surfing state sweep the top 
two places? Where were the Texans? The Oklahomans? The Tennesseans? 
</P>
<P>
 Abarca and Ionnone attribute their victory to good old-fashioned Hollywood 
charm. The couple broke up a few months ago. But in the best tinsel-town 
tradition, they didn't let that stop the show. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Abarca: "I looked at Christine and said, 'Let's just smile, play up to 
the camera and the audience and gaze at each other as if we were still in 
love.' " 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 DEBATE POINTS: U.S. Rep. Anthony Beilenson(D-Woodland Hills) has jokingly 
predicted that there will be so many debates between him and his GOP 
challenger, attorney and public policy wonk Richard Sybert, that voters will be 
"sick" of the pair before Election Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Sybert wrote Beilenson urging him to participate in 10 debates, 
each on a separate topic. He also took a swipe at the "town hall meetings" 
Beilenson has been holding with constituents in various parts of the 24th 
Congressional District, which includes Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are nothing more than thinly disguised campaign events on the public's 
nickel," Sybert wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Sybert's sometimes angry tone, Beilenson's reply was low-key; he 
pledged that there will be debates but indicated they could only be held in the 
last three weeks of the campaign season. 
</P>
<P>
 Before then, Beilenson told Sybert, the congressman would attend to the 
public's business. "Every year Congress' busiest time is the last two months of 
the session, and that will be especially true this year," he wrote. "Obviously, 
the only way I can properly represent my constituents . . . is to be in 
Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert fired back that if Beilenson has time to fly back to Los Angeles each 
weekend and hold regular town hall meetings then he has time for debates.

SANTA MONICA AIRPORT NEIGHBORS TO AIR COMPLAINTS; AIRCRAFT: THREE FATAL CRASHES 
ADD URGENCY TO RESIDENTS' CALLS FOR TIGHTER FLIGHT CONTROLS. THEY WILL BE ABLE 
TO SHARE THEIR CONCERNS WITH LOCAL AND FEDERAL OFFICIALS AT A COMMUNITY MEETING 
TUESDAY. 
</P>

<P>
 It didn't take three planes tumbling from the sky to get the attention of 
neighbors of the Santa Monica Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents have complained for years about noise from planes landing and taking 
off, while pilots, for their part, have tried to explain the safety precautions 
they take and the inevitability of noise from what is one of the nation's 
busiest single-runway airports. 
</P>
<P>
 But three fatal crashes in the past nine months have given the issue even more 
urgency. At a community meeting Tuesday night, residents will have the 
opportunity to share their concerns with local and federal officials, who plan 
to discuss recent safety recommendations made by a citizens' committee created 
after the most recent crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendations include increasing pilot education, purchasing new air 
traffic control gear and other safety equipment, conducting more aircraft 
inspections and re-evaluating the process by which residents file complaints 
concerning the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Councilwoman Ruth Galanter and U.S. Rep. Jane Harman (D-Rolling 
Hills) are sponsoring the meeting, which is primarily for residents of Venice 
and others with complaints about planes taking off to the west of the airport. 
Galanter previously held a meeting for residents of Cheviot Hills and other 
neighborhoods under the flight path to the east. 
</P>
<P>
 Galanter said she has received a growing number of complaints about the 
airport from residents recently. If it's true that pilots are flying lower or 
not following noise-reduction procedures, she said, she will urge the airport 
and the Federal Aviation Administration to do something about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The airport can step up its educational efforts for the pilots," she said. 
"The FAA has a lot of power, if they choose to exercise it." 
</P>
<P>
 Harman gave the committee's recommendations to FAA officials last week, and 
she hopes they'll respond by Tuesday, said Ed Hatcher, her chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The requests are very reasonable," he said. "The residents have very 
legitimate concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 But reconciling them with pilots' concerns won't be easy. For example, under 
one noise-abatement procedure already in use at the airport, pilots taking off 
to the west must fly over Penmar Golf Course instead of the surrounding 
residential streets. One of the committee's recommendations is that the airport 
tell pilots the exact heading to follow over the middle of the golf course. 
</P>
<P>
 To overfly the golf course, however, pilots must turn left as soon as they 
take off, then turn back to the right, said airport manager Tim Walsh. "It's a 
tricky little maneuver," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, outspoken pilot Don Brandsen says it's simply not realistic to expect 
pilots to follow an exact heading over the center of the course. 
</P>
<P>
 When you take off from the airport, he said, you're busy enough trying to gain 
altitude and keep up airspeed "without trying to find out whether you're 12 
inches this side of the golf course or 18 inches to that side of the golf 
course." 
</P>
<P>
 Compliance with the procedure appears marginal. During one 20-minute period on 
a sunny afternoon last week, only two of eight planes that took off kept to the 
middle of the golf course. Three flew along its edge and three others missed it 
completely, flying over residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors say that's not unusual. Pilots who stray are likely to find 
themselves over the Lincoln Place apartment of Frieda Marlin, who helped 
organize her neighbors against airport noise. Humans, she said, aren't the only 
ones disturbed by the planes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The birds don't sing anymore, not like they used to, because of the planes," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another frequent complaint of residents is that pilots ignore another 
procedure that is supposed to be in use -- to fly west until they reach Lincoln 
Boulevard. One of Marlin's neighbors, Gideon Dagan, said planes often turn 
early. 
</P>
<P>
 "It bothers me. Sometimes you're on the phone," he said as he stood on his 
front porch, distracted by a plane flying overhead. "You hear it yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 Griff Hoerner admits he's one of the early-turning culprits. He said that when 
he's flying a Piper Cub, a relatively slow plane, he has to stay closer to the 
airport on takeoff. Otherwise, he wouldn't be able to glide back to the 
airfield if his engine dies. 
</P>
<P>
 But he's trying to cooperate, he said. When one neighbor complained about his 
early turns, he called the resident to explain and even offered to give him a 
plane ride to demonstrate the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Brandsen, sitting in his office over the Spitfire Grill, said pilots and 
residents have shown they can work together, but he doesn't expect everyone to 
be happy. "As long as there are planes and people living next to airplanes, 
it's never going to go away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's particularly true when the airplanes are crashing. In the most recent 
accident in April, cable television director Patrick Dean Brinnon died while 
trying to accumulate enough flying hours to get a pilot's job. The engine of 
the Piper Saratoga he was piloting failed shortly after takeoff, and he crashed 
into a garage while trying to return to the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash was the third in five months involving planes taking off or landing 
at the airport. Five people in the planes died, although no one on the ground 
was hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no evidence that airport procedures contributed to any of the crashes. 
The airport has averaged one crash per 200,000 takeoffs and landings -- about 
one a year -- a safety record considered better than average. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, the airport director, said the explanation for increased airport noise 
of late is the increased number of flights in summer. Last summer, airport 
construction kept the number of flights down, but now on sunny days pilots are 
taking to the skies enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't have to tell that to Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a clear day," she said, "you can hear forever."

STUDENT HOPES POSTERS WILL SHOW MERCHANTS THE SIGN OF THE TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Television images of Koreatown businesses being burned and looted during the 
April, 1992, riots struck a deep chord within Hyung Suk Kim as he watched from 
the safety of his La Habra home. 
</P>
<P>
 A Korean national, Kim had moved to the Los Angeles area only three years 
earlier to study graphic design at the Art Center College of Design in 
Pasadena. He was about to graduate and planned to pursue a master's degree that 
fall when the riots struck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got a bad impression during the riots because the Korean community was 
targeted," said Kim, 36. "I wanted to help my people in the Koreatown 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Haunted by images of some of his countrymen losing their American dreams, Kim 
dedicated his graduate study to determining what had caused Koreatown to become 
a target of racially motivated violence, and what could be done to prevent 
another occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 In his research, Kim found that Latinos and African Americans make up most of 
Koreatown's population and that this non-Korean base felt alienated from Korean 
business owners for several reasons: their own poor economic conditions, envy 
of successful immigrants and the language barrier, especially in the form of 
signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "African Americans and Latinos don't understand this signage," he said. "These 
signs appear foreign to them so they feel uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim concluded that changing the signage in Koreatown to include English could 
be an effective means of letting non-Koreans feel more welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to make Koreatown's signage more culturally egalitarian, Kim's 
graduate thesis proposes bilingual English-Korean signs, with the English 
message slightly larger than and above the Korean message. 
</P>
<P>
 "Korean people here are well-educated," he explained. "They understand at 
least some English, and are familiar with English signs. This would let people 
know that Koreatown does not belong to Korea, it is part of American society." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramon Munoz, Kim's graduate adviser, supports the idea of bilingual signage. 
"To some extent, when you'd go down the street, you'd almost feel as though you 
understood Korean, seeing all the translations," he said. "That would make a 
lot of people who don't speak Korean feel more at ease." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim has also designed a master's project consisting of a series of posters 
calling for harmony in the community, displaying inspirational photographic 
images juxtaposed against equally balanced English and Korean-language 
messages. 
</P>
<P>
 A sample message reads: "Los Angeles is a unique historical circumstance. We 
are a diverse city with people from over 100 nations. If we learn to respect 
other cultures, we can grow as one community. It is like a tree with red, 
yellow and green leaves. It's more colorful to live in harmony."  
</P>
<P>
 Although his project does not include Spanish, Kim said the posters and the 
signs could easily be adapted to include a third language. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, who graduates next week, will display his posters, as well as models of 
some bilingual signs, from 6 to 8 p.m. Monday at Hollytron Electronics, 4641 
West Santa Monica Blvd. The exhibit will run through Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said he hopes to generate interest in his signs and posters from city and 
community leaders, many of whom he has invited to the opening. However, he 
acknowledges that many merchants may be reluctant to change their all-Korean 
signs.  
</P>
<P>
 "He found that there were some Korean store owners who were very apathetic to 
what he was doing," Munoz said. "It's not all open arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Although merchants may be unwilling to adopt Kim's bilingual signs, five local 
businesses and organizations in addition to Hollytron will be showcasing his 
posters in their storefronts for the next few weeks. Kim hopes the city will 
take an interest in sponsoring the posters as billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 If either of his projects catch on, he said he will stay in the United States 
long enough to follow it through before returning to Korea to set up his own 
graphics firm.

TOPICS / BRIEFLY; SCHOLARSHIPS: 3 STUDENTS WIN $1,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Westside students have received $1,000 scholarships for essays written 
in response to the question: "Can we all get along as a multicultural society?" 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to addressing race relations, high school seniors taking part in 
the American Honda/Mario Machado Scholarship contest were asked how they would 
cover stories relating to race relations if they were newspaper editors or 
television producers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westside winners were Hao Nguyen, 18, of the Los Angeles Center for 
Enriched Studies in Culver City, and Martha Lee Porter, 17, and Tiffanie 
Thompson, 18, both of Alexander Hamilton High School in West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen plans to attend UCLA, Porter will attend Southern California College in 
Costa Mesa and Thompson will attend USC. All three students hope to study 
communications. 
</P>
<P>
 The scholarship, sponsored by American Honda Motors and named in honor of KABC 
radio host Mario Machado, was founded three years ago with the purpose of 
helping financially disadvantaged and ethnically diverse high school seniors 
who are interested in a career in communications. 
</P>
<P>
 Essays were judged by Los Angeles news anchors and reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 There were 10 winners in all.

TOPICS / SCIENCE; SPACE-AGE PROGRAMS TARGET BLACK CHILDREN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hal and Bettye Walker believe that for black children to seize control of 
their futures, they must shoot for the moon. 
</P>
<P>
 The Walkers are not speaking metaphorically. 
</P>
<P>
 The retired laser scientist and his wife, an educator, say black children must 
be educated about not only space travel, but the fast-moving world of science 
and technology that has brought about everything from space shuttles to laser 
disc players. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the lack of emphasis within the black community on such knowledge, the 
Baldwin Hills couple say, that prompted them to recently open the Science and 
Discovery Learning Center at 3639 La Brea Ave. The Walkers aim to demystify 
science for black youngsters and make it as real to them as Nintendo. 
</P>
<P>
 Hal Walker Jr., who developed laser equipment that projected images of the 
moon back to the Earth during the 1969 Apollo moonwalk, says it is time that 
blacks focus on the importance of science to their progress as a people. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that we have to pursue using technology as a solution to social 
problems," said Walker, 60, who is being honored with an exhibit at the 
Smithsonian Institution's National Museum of American History in Washington 
commemorating the moonwalk. The Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza also is honoring 
him with an exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettye Walker, a retired teacher and educator with the Compton and Los Angeles 
school districts, echoed her husband's conviction that the key to the future is 
involvement in technological advancements. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer to all our troubles is technology. We have to make technologists," 
she said. "And we have to start doing it early." 
</P>
<P>
 At the center, an airy five-room office space, children can learn how to use a 
computer, assemble simple robots, participate in round table scientific 
discussions and watch a slide show on the properties of laser light. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is good because it'll help me become an inventor," said 8-year-old Benar 
Arlain, wearing a T-shirt emblazoned with the slogan "Passing the Torch." "I 
like science. I know a lot of guys who want to be in this." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, the more than two dozen participants are all boys between the ages of 
4 and 17, members of the African-American Male Achievers Network (A-Man for 
short), a nonprofit mentoring group formed two years ago by the Walkers. . 
</P>
<P>
 The activities of the group took a scientific turn last year when, during a 
trip to the NASA Space Camp in Florida, Hal Walker realized virtually no black 
youths were participating except for his group. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really got their attention, especially the simulators that had them 
walking on the moon, moving through zero gravity," Hal Walker recalled. "It 
makes such a difference in interest level when you can see things close up. I 
thought: 'We need to make our own camp.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The newly acquired space on La Brea, wedged between the shuttered Baldwin 
Theater Complex and a mini-mall, practically fell out of the sky: the couple 
were frantically searching for an office after they had to vacate their 
temporary quarters at King-Drew Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple hope to generate enough corporate and community interest to keep 
the office. All of their office furniture, scientific equipment and computers 
were donated.  
</P>
<P>
 All of this, they say, is not so much to groom technology wizards as to expose 
a generation of black children to air that is too often perceived as rarefied. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, we're not looking to create 1,000 scientists," said Hal Walker. "Just 
one. But the key thing is getting the young people to spread the word."  
</P>
<P>
 The Walkers hope to expand the free program, which already has a waiting list 
of 10. Information: (213) 296-1182.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-WILSHIRE; PALEONTOLOGISTS ARE HAVING A FIELD DAY IN STICKY 
SITUATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN BUZBEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saber-toothed cats, mammoths, camels and other beasts that had a bad day in 
the tar pits 30,000 years ago will at least have an audience this summer as the 
George C. Page Museum of La Brea Discoveries opens the excavations at Pit 91 
for public viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Paleontologists and volunteers eager to pull the fossils out of their sticky 
graves had feared that fiscal problems affecting Los Angeles County would keep 
the dig closed this summer. But the county museum's nonprofit foundation came 
through with $7,000, and now the dig continues. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the stuff of Indiana Jones. Visitors who step out on the observation 
deck can see bones sticking out of the sandy soil and can watch the workers 
peel tar-soaked sand off the fossils. The work is slow-going. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very careful to dig up and record each position of each bone," said 
Chris Shaw, collections manager for the museum. "It's a long and tedious job." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, there's no shortage of volunteers eager to help. Anyone at least 16 
years old who puts in 96 hours volunteering in the lab can qualify to help with 
the dig, Shaw said. For those who just want a peek, the museum is open 10 a.m. 
to 5 p.m. every day at 5801 Wilshire Blvd. Admission is $5 for adults, with 
discounts for seniors, students and children. 
</P>
<P>
 Pit 91, the only active dig in the museum, has always been popular with 
visitors, said Brett Henry, the public relations director for the county 
museum. Workers who started excavating the pits in 1913 left Pit 91 untouched, 
expecting that a museum would be built above it. 
</P>
<P>
 But the museum went elsewhere, and in 1969 paleontologists started work on Pit 
91 full time. That came to an end in 1981, when Prop. 13 dried up museum funds. 
Eyeing the crowds of tourists coming to town for the Olympics, the museum 
reopened the dig in 1984 and ever since has kept it open for two months every 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not bad work, Shaw said. The paleontologists and volunteers can spend a 
day unearthing fossils of any and everything claimed by the tar, including 
mammoths, snails, birds -- even plants. 
</P>
<P>
 And when they're done, they don't have to sleep in a tent in some desolate 
part of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can go home and have a nice dinner," Shaw said. "We're spoiled here."  
</P>

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; PLAZA OFFICIALS HOPE OUTLET GIVES BOOST TO SAGGING 
MALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza officials hope the addition of a T.J. Maxx 
discount clothing outlet, which recently began construction, will help boost 
the fortunes of the mall, marred for years by empty shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect it to be a big draw," plaza manager Joe Rouzan said of the 
30,000-square-foot store, scheduled to open in November. "They're (T. J. Maxx) 
moving real fast. Just over the past weekend, the construction workers made a 
lot of progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine storefronts on the plaza's upper level -- cleared for a theater complex 
that will be constructed outside the mall -- will be utilized for T.J. Maxx, a 
national retail chain that operates 44 stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of T. J. Maxx and two women's clothing stores scheduled to open 
within the next two months -- Trapp's and Forever 21 -- will increase tenant 
occupancy from 70% to 85%, Rouzan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a T. J. Maxx is open in Culver City, a few miles west of the Baldwin 
Hills mall, spokeswoman Jane Joyce said company officials decided that the 
Crenshaw Plaza area fit the store's demographic profile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at a variety of things -- household income, population density, 
number of families," she said. "Some people pointed out that we do have a store 
not very far away from the plaza. But we tend to cluster stores in areas that 
like our merchandise." 
</P>
<P>
 The mall has been struggling for four years to attract major retailers. The 
plaza is anchored by Robinsons-May, the Broadway and Sears. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the center was enclosed and refurbished, opening as the Baldwin Hills 
Crenshaw Plaza in 1988, it has struggled with low occupancy rates.  
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, Robinsons-May shut down for six 
months, hurting nearby stores that depended on its customers for business. Two 
stores, McLendon's Hats and Buster Brown shoes, closed during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Rouzan said, the new T. J. Maxx shows the mall is on the rebound. And 
there are other signs as well: The Disney Store, which opened last year, has 
consistently reported the highest video sales of all Disney stores in the 
Southern California region, he noted, and Wilson's House of Suede and Leather 
has out-grossed its sister stores for the past three months.

AIRPORT: NOISE AND HAZARDS OF LOW-FLYING PLANES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am writing to notify you of a continuing hazardous condition that exists in 
our neighborhood of Cheviot Hills in West Los Angeles which resulted from 
changes made by the Santa Monica Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst of this hazard began just after the Northridge earthquake of 
January, 1994. Planes that used to never fly over our neighborhood, which is 
about three miles away from the airport, are now flying at such a low level 
that they are noisy and dangerous, as they do not have sufficient altitude to 
glide into the airport in case of a loss of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Where we used to never hear a plane except off in the distance, we now have 
daily occurrences of low-flying aircraft, both landing and taking off, some 
only 100 feet above our houses. Pilots of jets, World War II-vintage craft, 
training DC-3s, experimental aircraft and other private and rented planes have 
always been able to begin their approach at any level they deem safe, but the 
height of the Century City buildings used to keep them higher and farther north 
over Pico. At the elevations they are now, they must rely on noisy and 
unreliable engine power rather than "glide" in order to avoid crashing into our 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 When our homeowner groups have asked for help or information, the Santa Monica 
Airport has told us that the problem is the responsibility of the FAA. The FAA 
has told us that it is the responsibility of the Santa Monica Airport. In my 
opinion, the denial of assistance from the FAA, Santa Monica Airport and jet 
owners, or even an admission that there is a problem over our neighborhood, is 
a result of their protection of their own interests. Because we are residents 
of Los Angeles and not Santa Monica, perhaps they feel that they owe us no 
consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 Though they say that there have been no changes that they have made which have 
affected our neighborhood, they neglected to mention the other changes that 
they recently admitted because of complaints made by politicians and other 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, planes are no longer directed to fly over the Hollywood Bowl, nor 
are they directed to enter the approach or turning pattern over the Pacific 
Palisades, most of Beverlywood, the marina and Fox Studios/Century City. They 
now direct these planes to report in over the Santa Monica and San Diego 
Freeway interchange, which causes all of these to enter the approach pattern 
over Cheviot Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 The airport manager noted that there have been three recent airplane accidents 
and even deaths involving planes using the Santa Monica Airport. Hopefully, 
there will be no other deaths that could have been prevented if the planes had 
been moved higher and into a wider pattern as there was before. Unfortunately 
for us homeowners, we can't lower our houses.

HOUSING: CITY CHARTER AND NEW HOPE PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The article of July 17 about project New Hope ("How A Good Idea Became a 
Political Hot Potato") left the reader with the notion that the (Santa Monica) 
City Council could use the parcel in question for something other than on-site, 
affordable housing. It should have been made clear that replacing the 11 
affordable units previously there was mandated by the city's charter. Debate 
about open space, parkland, commercial use, luxury housing or any other use on 
this site must begin with that fact.

REGIONAL REPORT / WESTSIDE; WILMINGTON; CEMETERY DISPUTE MARS 38-HOME 
DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN WOODWARD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Exactly what lies six feet under an old Civil War headquarters in Wilmington 
is being disputed, as plans to build affordable housing on the property move 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeological studies have found nothing under the development area except 
dirt, marine shells, glass and the odd golf ball core or plastic gaming chip. 
</P>
<P>
 But historians who operate the local Drum Barracks Civil War Museum believe 
the planned 38-home development would be directly over the bodies of seven or 
more nameless Civil War soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum director Marge O'Brien and her assistant Marc Weiser said the soldiers 
are buried in a cemetery somewhere near McFarland Avenue and Denni Street. The 
roads mark the eastern boundary of the 5 1/2-acre site where Urban 
Redevelopment of America plans to start building next month. The company bought 
the land from the Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railroad in December. 
</P>
<P>
 With no marked graves and only a rough 1872 map of the barracks to go by, 
O'Brien and Weiser admit that the location of the cemetery cannot be 
pinpointed. But they have uncovered the service records of 24 men who were 
buried in a barracks cemetery between 1862 and 1866. 
</P>
<P>
 In Compton, a memorial in the Woodlawn Cemetery has been erected to honor 17 
unidentified men who were removed from a Wilmington fort cemetery in 1887. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien and Weiser are worried about the bodies of the other seven men, plus 
any more people who were buried in the area after the war. 
</P>
<P>
 "These men gave their lives for this country. Don't they deserve more than 
being buried under housing?" O'Brien said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gene Wilson, vice president of the development company, said no evidence 
of the cemetery was found by the Archaeological Resource Management Co. in 
Anaheim, which was hired in response to the concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Archeologist Carol R. Demcak researched the history of the area, surveyed the 
site and dug four three-foot pits on the land in May and June. She concluded 
that no Civil War period artifacts or graves exist there. 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery, she said, must be in another part of the old Drum Barracks 
compound. In that case, the cemetery may have been covered by houses or streets 
long ago.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien and Weiser said they are not convinced.  
</P>
<P>
 "Only one of the four test pits is close to the site (where) we believe the 
bodies are buried," Weiser said. "And the bodies could easily be seven to eight 
feet down." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the museum is trying to solicit the help of an expert from Cal State 
Long Beach to do radar testing, which would detect any anomalies underground. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just too big a lot to come in and excavate the whole site, but if they 
don't come in and do ground radar, there's definitely going to be that 
question: Did they build over bodies?" Weiser said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, Demcak said radar testing will not work because overhead 
wires and a railway line will create electrical fields that will interfere with 
radar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We could have asked for half of Wilmington to be dug up, but it did not seem 
appropriate, based on the fact that we couldn't determine exactly where the 
cemetery was located," Demcak said. "I am convinced that there is no historic 
cemetery in that (development) area."

REGIONAL REPORT / WESTSIDE; MID-CITY; $50,000 REWARD IS OFFERED FOR INFORMATION 
ON KILLER OF MINISTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERESTEIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A $50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to the arrest of the 
killer of an 81-year-old minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanche Thomas, former pastor of Mt. Zion Churches United in Watts and a 
minister at the Holy Light Baptist Church at 96th Street and Normandie Avenue, 
was bound, gagged and sexually assaulted in her Mid-City apartment. The cause 
of death was under investigation last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' grandson, Daniel Better, found the body when he checked on her July 25 
after she did not respond to phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said her killer entered the apartment in the 1700 block of South La 
Brea Avenue between midnight and dawn the day she was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few things were stolen, investigators doubt that robbery was the 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just overwhelming to know she died like that," said Thomas' daughter, 
Dr. Shirley Jean Better, a professor of social work at Cal State Los Angeles. 
"You don't want your mother to die like that. You want her to die peacefully, 
in her sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Better said that her mother, a former country schoolteacher in her native 
Arkansas, was a strong advocate of expanding women's roles in religion. 
</P>
<P>
 She also worked to inspire African American and Latino youths in her parish to 
pursue education as an alternative to the violence on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Several parishioners and members of the community have established a fund in 
Thomas' name to provide food and clothing for the homeless, who had become one 
of her most recent causes, Better said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday, the City Council approved the posting of a $25,000 reward in 
order to encourage anyone with information to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, televangelist the Rev. Gene Scott donated a check matching 
that amount to the reward pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Galloway, press deputy for City Councilman Nate Holden, who represents 
the Mid-City area, said a posthumous resolution acknowledging Thomas' 
accomplishments will be presented to her family Thursday by council. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about Thomas' slaying can contact the Police 
Department's Wilshire Division at (213) 847-3990 or at (213) 485-4022 after 4 
p.m. LESLIE BERESTEIN

FOR SENIORS / WESTSIDE; LINDA FELDMAN; FOR THIS DOCTOR, SCULPTING BECAME SALVE 
FOR HIS PAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sy Rosenwasser's beloved black bag used to contain all the tools of his trade 
-- catheter, stethoscope, blood pressure machine. Now it sits on a table in his 
studio with the tools of his new passion -- patina chemicals, gloves and cloths 
to polish the bronze statues he has created. 
</P>
<P>
 The 69-year-old urologist-turned-sculptor still remembers the exhilaration he 
felt when he decided to become a doctor -- and the salve that art provided for 
his pain. 
</P>
<P>
 With all seriousness he looks you in the eyes and praises the catheter -- a 
medical device inserted to clear passageways. "Such a fabulous tool," he said. 
"It can take someone from absolute pain to relief. It made me become a 
urologist and it appealed to my ability to solve problems." 
</P>
<P>
 That ability sprouted in his boyhood in New York, when he tackled such 
challenges as earning pocket change. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers selling shopping bags outside his parents' fish market and hiring 
a team of other boys to sell soda pop on street corners. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up as a first-generation American, his mother influenced him by saying 
that as a Jew in an intolerant society one must make a special effort to 
contribute. And medicine was one of those ways, playing to his desire to heal 
people and his strength as a problem solver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Surgery is a solution for me. A surgeon looks at something, figures out what 
needs to be cut out and returns the patient to normal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 For Rosenwasser there has always been a solution to any problem. So imagine 
this man, who chose a profession that so fit his personality, watching the 
woman he loved endure 37 years of illness. 
</P>
<P>
 She got sick shortly after they were married. He was juggling three practices, 
looking after his wife, and eventually their two children, and trying to 
maintain his well-being when a cardiologist friend invited him to someone's 
home where a sculptor was giving lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 It was love at first touch. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had any time or interest in art but when I was handed this sack of 
clay I didn't want to leave. It was like the other side of me which wanted to 
build and create had finally found a way to do that," he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happened to me was that I created a balance -- I found something to 
engross me and at the same time it gave me a free mind to deal with all of my 
problems," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenwasser built a studio and worked in it in the evenings keeping a phone 
nearby in case a patient called. He started to develop a critical eye and like 
everything in his life, he would never be happy with something if it was half 
good. So from the very beginning it was never a hobby or an escape -- it was 
going to be meaningful. 
</P>
<P>
 He went from figurative representations to abstract and eventually created the 
fountains for the sculpture garden at his Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 His work, with titles like "Amore" and "La Familia," are sensual masses of 
bronze laced with his feelings about relationships. With the death of his wife 
five years ago and his retirement from his medical practice, Rosenwasser felt a 
release. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved my wife and I wanted to take care of her. I loved medicine, too. But, 
I feel relieved," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenwasser is a man from a generation that took care of the people they loved 
and nourished the talents they developed themselves. It was an essential part 
of being a man. He was from an era where being a doctor had a simple yet 
compelling mission -- to take care of your patient and help them to get well, 
disregarding cost.  
</P>
<P>
 "As a doctor I was an advocate for my patients and now, unfortunately, many 
doctors have become gatekeepers trying to keep patients out of the system in 
order to maintain their income, which essentially is dictated by the government 
and insurance companies. I was for private care in an insurance company-driven 
environment and I knew I had to leave medicine," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he's in his studio every day. 
</P>
<P>
 His work sells from $2,500 to over $100,000 and he has been commissioned by 
Rolex Corp., Hyatt Hotels Corp. and Harcourt, Brace Jovanovich Inc. He has 
shown pieces in galleries here and abroad. On Sept. 30, his wife's birthday, he 
will donate, in her memory, "La Familia" to the UCLA Medical Center as part of 
Women's Health Month.

A RISKY AREA TO GAMBLE WITH; STATE NEEDS THE POWER TO MONITOR LOCAL GAMING 
CLUBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Legislation to bring needed oversight to California's booming card club and 
casino industry is being dealt a losing hand in Sacramento, where some 
legislators seem to see the political odds as favoring delay rather than 
action. That's shortsighted. 
</P>
<P>
 Government errs when it waits too long to regulate in an area where oversight 
clearly is needed. Legalized gambling is a classic case in point. In Nevada, 
which now boasts a thriving tourist industry aimed increasingly at the family 
business, it took law enforcement decades to clean up the corruption and crime 
that tainted the gaming industry. By failing to act now the California 
Legislature risks letting these problems become entrenched, as Nevada did. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, gamblers in the Golden State bet $12.5 billion. Over half was wagered 
at card clubs and casinos, the fastest-growing segment of legalized gambling in 
the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the state lottery or horse racing, there is no state regulatory agency 
to monitor the gaming industry. Local governments simply do not have the staffs 
and the expertise to block money laundering, tax evasion and extortion. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 2803 and AB 362 are two bills that would give the state oversight power and 
allow it to assemble the requisite expertise. They are sensible and bipartisan. 
They were written by Democrats and endorsed by state Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, a 
Republican. They would create a state agency to license card clubs and casinos 
operating within the state. Modeled after Nevada's system, the California 
Gambling Control Commission would work in conjunction with a new Division of 
Gambling Control within the attorney general's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Much as the state Lottery Commission and the Horse Racing Board are financed 
from gambling revenues, the state gaming regulation agencies would be funded by 
gaming fees from the casinos. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills would preserve the local option to reject card clubs. They are 
reasonable measures to help avoid potential problems, and they deserve support 
from both friends and foes of legalized gambling, not to mention members of the 
Legislature.

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * NIGHTCLUB RESTRICTIONS: Approved a resolution that will place several 
restrictions on the operation of Don Quixote's East Ballroom, a nightclub in 
Boyle Heights that has been deemed a public nuisance by the Board of Zoning 
Appeals. Among the conditions placed on the club are that it close at midnight, 
that all patrons be searched for weapons and that six uniformed security guards 
be assigned to monitor the off-site parking facility. Residents of a nearby 
apartment house have complained that patrons of the club are responsible for 
excessive noise and crime problems in the neighborhood late at night. The owner 
of the nightclub has countered that the crime problem is a community issue not 
caused by his patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 * STREET LIGHTS: Instructed the Board of Public Works to proceed with a 
project to install modern street-light poles along Oxford Avenue between 
Washington Boulevard and the Santa Monica Freeway. The high illumination, 
25-foot poles are expected to improve the safety of vehicular and pedestrian 
traffic, as well as serve as a deterrent to crime. 
</P>
<P>
 * POLICE TASK FORCE: Approved the transfer of $55,000 from the reserve fund to 
the police overtime fund to pay detectives working overtime with the Los

<P>
 When Madonna sat down a few months ago for her infamous visit with David 
Letterman and fired up a big, fat stogie, fans of Latin tropical and 
underground dance music recognized the gesture. 
</P>
<P>
 It belongs to India, the cutting-edge diva known for wailing into a microphone 
while pungent smoke from the cigar in her well-manicured fingers curls past her 
darkly beautiful face. 
</P>
<P>
 But there's more to India than simply serving as a model for one of Madonna's 
shock tactics. Her vocal talent and musical vision mark her as a creative force 
and potential star of the first magnitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Few singers can match the operatically trained India's supple vocal 
gymnastics, and her vibrant voice is flushed with stronger, finer feelings than 
any of Madonna's musical offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 India, 25, is the first performer from the hip-hop '80s to set her sights on 
conquering not just one but two musical domains: the international dance-club 
sound of her peers and the sizzling Caribbean salsa that is the Puerto 
Rico-born, Bronx-raised singer-songwriter's rich cultural legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love and Happiness (Yemaya y Ochun)," India's bilingual single, recently made 
No. 1 on Billboard's dance club chart, just as "Vivir Lo Nuestro" ("Live for 
Ourselves"), her duet with salsa crooner Marc Anthony, jumped to the top spot 
on the Latin singles chart. 
</P>
<P>
 Her tropical solo music debut earlier this year, "Llego La India" ("Presenting 
India"), burned up the Latin music album charts. "Beautiful People," the dance 
track she wrote for fellow diva Barbara Tucker, competed there with India's own 
hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "India's blossomed into a major innovator in the dance underground since I 
first saw her perform in 1988," says Marques Wyatt, deejay and promoter of the 
Brass dance club at LunaPark in West Hollywood and other dance music functions 
in Los Angeles. "She could always sing and write, but now the two have fused 
into something celestial." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the cigar, that began about four years ago. Unlike Madonna's 
shock-shtick, India says her smoke runs in the blood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time my grandmother lit up a cigar, I'd say, 'Put it out! I can't 
breathe!' " recalls the former Lindabel Caballero, sitting in the living room 
of the downtown Manhattan penthouse she shares with her husband, renowned 
remixer-deejay-producer "Little" Louie Vega. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once, just before she passed away -- may she rest in peace -- she looked at 
me and said, 'Girl, you keep messing with me about my cigar. You don't know how 
good this is, how free it makes you feel. You want to get to me now, right? But 
when you get older, before you have your kids, you're going to be holding one 
too.' 
</P>
<P>
 " 'No, I'm not!' I told her. The next thing you know, she dies, and a year 
later I got this urge to smoke cigars." 
</P>
<P>
 Casting a longing look at the hand-wrapped specimen awaiting her pleasure, 
India defers to the tobacco phobia of her guest and takes up the subject of her 
celebrated imitator. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watching Madonna puffing on a cigar on David Letterman's show, I thought, 
'Gosh, she's feeling so India! All she needs is long, black hair and a trip to 
the Caribbean to burn her skin up,' " India says in ripe, "Nuyorican" accents. 
"She was feeling good about it, and it made me feel good. I actually saw it as 
a compliment." 
</P>
<P>
 Though on record she can sound like a funk incarnation of Maria Callas, only 
live performance conveys the complete "La India" thrill. 
</P>
<P>
 She eyeballs audience members with a direct, dark-eyed gaze while wailing her 
heart out. She might begin at the chesty low tones of the scale, bending notes 
every which way as she climbs to the highest register. Grabbing one at the very 
top, she hangs on . . . and on. The power of her emotion is so indelible that 
it lingers in the mind's ear even after her voice has stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, she performed at San Francisco's Sound Factory, with her 
husband as deejay. After a soaring conclusion to "Love and Happiness," India 
turned over the crowd to the deejay via a hip-hop aria. "Louie! 
Lou-ou-ou-ou-ie! Where's my boo-boo?" she called out, then reprised the final 
melodic line from "Happiness," stretching out the last note until Vega dropped 
in the beat from the song's euphorically tribal instrumentals. A mega-jolt of 
electricity flashed through the room.  
</P>
<P>
 India and Vega's partnership dates back to a grade school friendship in "La 
Candela" ("the Candle"), one of the Bronx's toughest areas. In high school, 
Vega became the borough's top-ranking disc-spinner, and India would pass out 
flyers and herd all her friends to his dances. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time she was 15, her exotic looks had earned her a modeling career, but 
she wanted more. One day she appeared at the Devil's Nest, Vega's main club 
headquarters, where TKA, one of the first Latino hip-hop ensembles, was holding 
auditions for a female singer. No contest. India dropped out of school.  
</P>
<P>
 With the group and Vega's guidance, she cut her teeth in the same "street" 
music environment that had nurtured Madonna. But India realized that her big, 
soulful voice and precision-honed technique were more suited to R&B. Besides, 
she expected that house (a blend of R&B and disco), would be the next big 
thing. In 1992, Vega and India's single "I Can't Get No Sleep" became a smash 
on the international underground dance circuit. 
</P>
<P>
 As their popularity as performers shot up, India (she acquired the name as a 
child, thanks to her strikingly Indian appearance) began investigating her 
Afro-Caribbean roots. 
</P>
<P>
 The background harmonies she arranged and sang for Vega's remixes of Tito 
Puente's "Ran Khan Khan," from the "Mambo Kings" soundtrack, were playing over 
the recording studio speakers one evening when Latin music legend Eddie 
Palmieri strolled in to talk business. India was sitting in a corner, blowing 
smoke rings. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sounds nice, sounds nice," said Palmieri of India's harmonies. "And who is 
that young lady smoking the cigar?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, that's my wife," Vega replied, adding that the harmonies were hers. 
Intrigued by India's vocal chops, passion and cigar habit, Palmieri decided to 
groom her to lead the next generation of tropical singers. India asked for time 
to prepare. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie Palmieri took me to school," she says. "He taught me about the rhythm, 
how you improvise within Latin beats. You have to distinguish the up from the 
down beat. It's different and harder than dance. I thank God that the rhythm 
was already inside me and I was able to grab onto it real quick."  
</P>
<P>
 Her graduation thesis was "Llego La India," the only album Palmieri has ever 
produced for a female singer. Like "Vivir Lo Nuestro," her pairing with Marc 
Anthony from a compilation album of duets, it sounds as though India has been 
wrapping a crystal-clear soprano around rumbas, merengues , batas and boleros 
all her life. 
</P>
<P>
 But India is not satisfied. Latin music may be her mainstream and dance music 
her experimental ground, but she seeks the same innovative partnership with a 
Latin music producer that she shares with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 "Louie and I still see ourselves as teen-agers," she says, "growing up and 
wanting to do something, experimenting and going out on a limb. We want to stay 
in the underground because we're doing it for the music, not to be on pop 
charts. In another 15 years, these records are going to be classics, just like 
the underground club hits we used to listen to and still love."  
</P>
<P>
 The producer of India's upcoming album, "Dicen Que Soy . . . " ("They Say I Am 
. . . "), is 32- year-old Sergio George, who also produced last year's "The 
Mambo Kings," Tito Puente's 100th album. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Llego' was, 'I've arrived and I can sing this incredible old school, the 
motherland of our music,' " says India. "The new album will be, 'This is me, my 
flavor in a tropical way,' and showing what I can do with my voice. The mistake 
of 'Llego' is that it only works my soprano. There's so much more than hitting 
these piercing high notes. Where's the excitement and sustenance of the sultry 
low tones?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the album, which will be released Sept. 13 by RMM Records, India and George 
are creating a new wrinkle in "a New York salsa vibe," says the producer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to inject elements here and there -- vocally and musically -- that 
dance-club kids can also relate to. . . . We're using the roots of classical 
tropical music and breaking the rules, if there were any to begin with. To me, 
there are no rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Musically restless, propelled by a feverish energy and prodigiously gifted, 
India seems willing to take on almost any musical form.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's so many other things I want to do," she says. "I don't want to do 
them to be different or just for a challenge, but because my heart and soul 
tell me to."

ON LOCATION; ACID-WASHED FASHION; ROBERT ALTMAN IS FASHIONING A FARCICAL 
PORTRAIT OF YET ANOTHER GANG OF PROFITEERS AND POSEURS, WITH A FEW GENUINE 
VISIONARIES THROWN IN. WELL, ISN'T THAT JUST FASHIONABLE.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Looking like a vampire desperate for a feed, Richard Grant recoils from Kim 
Basinger as if she were a gilt crucifix. But it's even worse: She's an airhead 
TV fashion reporter, closing in for her own version of blood-sucking, the sound 
bite. 
</P>
<P>
 Decadently resplendent in fire-engine red lipstick, scarlet velvet suit, black 
velvet cutaway topcoat, heart-shaped blue spectacles, Grant portrays a new 
romantic fashion designer loosely modeled after the provocative British 
designer Vivienne Westwood. His character supposedly never deigns to read 
fashion magazines, much less join the gawking masses at shows by the 
competition. But here he is in a converted Paris subway station trying to hide 
in the crowd gathered for the collection premiere by an underground designer 
played by Forest Whitaker. ("Where else would an underground designer have a 
show but under ground?" chirps Basinger.) 
</P>
<P>
 As Grant shields his face with a velvet fedora roomy enough to plant a 
Christmas tree, the brassy reporter descends, pertly badgering him on what he 
thinks of Whitaker's "recouped, deconstructed look." 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot deconstruct a look before you construct one," Grant hisses 
venomously. "Learn how to draw first before you start farting around with 
finger-paints. It's exactly what Schiaparelli said about Chanel: 'The damn 
bitch has been selling the same frock for the last 35 years.' You can't go 
forward backward; you have to go back to go forward." 
</P>
<P>
 "But . . ." Basinger starts to protest futilely. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have one more thing to say to the press in general and to you in 
particular," the designer spits back. "How many g's are there in bugger off?" 
Grant's blanched pancake makeup fairly steams and the inverted question mark of 
a black forelock artfully plastered to his forehead droops slightly, as if in 
sympathy with his fit of frustration and disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 "My, what an artistic temperament," the reporter drawls ironically as she 
slinks away. "Where I come from, we call it an asshole." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cut!" yells Robert Altman, his face breaking into a grudging, crooked grin. 
"Good, very good, tres bien ." But the two cameras continue to roll, catching 
actors and extras unawares. It's a tried-and-true Altman trick. Since the 
actors always wear microphones, they're constantly "on," in character -- even, 
perhaps especially, when the director fakes a cut. "The crew picks up all these 
soundtracks and how Bob will use them, we don't know," muses Lauren Bacall. 
</P>
<P>
 The technique is tailor-made for this "documentary feature" on fashion where 
Basinger and Grant, Bacall, Julia Roberts, Tim Robbins, Sophia Loren, Marcello 
Mastroianni, Lyle Lovett, Tracey Ullman, Sally Kellerman and Danny Aiello, 
among others on the epic, eclectic cast, were peppered through actual shows of 
the Paris fall collections. 
</P>
<P>
 A fter skewering Hollywood in "The Player" and turning a jaundiced eye on the 
exploded nuclear family in "Short Cuts," Altman is crafting a farcical portrait 
of yet another realm of poseurs, profiteers and genuine visionaries. 
"Pret-a-Porter" (French for ready- to-wear), due for release at the end of the 
year, far and away his most ambitious undertaking. For 11 weeks this spring in 
Paris, Altman conducted his controlled experiment in chaos theory through opera 
house, airport, museum, hotel, restaurant, subway station, chateau, designer 
atelier, street, bridge and, of course, fashion show runway, both real and 
fabricated.  
</P>
<P>
 Altman's rolling revue encamped at Dior, Miyake, Gaultier, Lacroix and Rykiel. 
Under the high-vaulted ceiling of the Roman baths at Cluny museum, he staged a 
broad spoof of a show that could have been titled "The Emperor's New Clothes." 
As unclothed models made their beatific glide down the runway, Altman strained 
to make his voice heard after the 500 actors and clamoring extras thundered 
into wild applause. More models, clothed this time, flocked into an opulent 
Parisian restaurant hosting a Bulgari jewelry opening as Altman maneuvered his 
actors through the party, snatching their improvised dialogue and that of 
guests, journalists and designers mingling about. 
</P>
<P>
 The film, at first effusively embraced by the fashion industry, was 
capriciously snubbed by a handful of influential designers and editors -- Karl 
Lagerfeld, Valentino, Vogue Editor Anna Wintour and Women's Wear Daily 
Publisher John Fairchild among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people are just paranoid," snorts Altman. "They don't have any idea 
what the film is about and would never listen. They're all stupid, 
self-important people, basically. And they're guilty. Any time anybody says, 'I 
don't want you talking about me,' that means they've got something to hide. 
Basically we don't care about them." 
</P>
<P>
 The 66-year-old director is sitting behind his desk in the production office 
off the Champs-Elysees, looking more than a little haggard after weeks of 
14-hour days' and nights' shooting. Trying to make a free-form film in a 
country ruled by linear Cartesian thinking and rigid bureaucracy has taken its 
toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've made four films here and I've said each time, it's the last," Altman 
grumbles. "I guess I forget all these problems." 
</P>
<P>
 A few days earlier, he suffered a run-in with an obnoxiously drunken 
government inspector and tried to throw him off the set. No Hercule Poirot, the 
inspector spied Tracey Ullman's pre-teen daughter, who was visiting the set, 
and leaped to the illogical deduction that the filmmaker was violating child 
labor laws. "We had to show this inspector and his buddies the dailies to prove 
she was not in the film. They just harassed us terribly." 
</P>
<P>
 There is also the maddening exasperation of communicating with the French 
crew. "It's hard enough to express abstract ideas and humor and subtleties in 
your own language," says the director. "Having to explain in French just makes 
my job more difficult because I have to be so specific, and I'm looking for 
non-specific things to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're setting up events, then documenting them, rather than dictating what 
happens, like 'Nashville' or 'MASH.' It is written literally as it's being 
made." 
</P>
<P>
 The actors themselves are writing and improvising a great deal of the 
dialogue. "If I see behavior I thought up, I'd get bored pretty quickly," says 
the director. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever happens one day changes the direction for what is going to happen 
the next day and 20 days after that. It has a life of its own; it's a living 
sculpture. The French crews don't understand that. They're used to doing things 
in a more literal way, where everything is storyboarded and laid out. This kind 
of film isn't done that way. I do films that way, and I can almost promise you 
the next one is going to be that way. This one is creating too much anxiety." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman first concocted his idea to do a film on fashion one rainy Paris day 10 
years ago when his wife, Kathryn, dragged him to a Sonia Rykiel show. At first 
feigning sickness and a bit hung over, the director nonetheless shook off his 
boredom. "I was completely electrified," he recalls. "When the music started 
up, the lights went on and the models hit the runway, I said to myself that 
this is fantastic theater." But deciding to do the film didn't mean financing 
was immediately forthcoming. "People would ask me what's the movie about, 
what's the script, and I'd say, 'It's about this phenomenon.' These guys who 
sell this product really want simplistic things they can sell to an audience 
and get their money back." 
</P>
<P>
 But the surprise success of "The Player," followed by "Short Cuts," which won 
last year's top prize at the Venice Film Festival, intervened; suddenly Altman, 
erstwhile Hollywood pariah, was bankable again. After a series of negotiations 
with a number of independent producers -- and the emergence of a script and 
several key actors -- Miramax took on the $20-million film. 
</P>
<P>
 'P ret-a-Porter" tracks a mur der-mystery through the Paris fashion season, 
with as many detours as the capital on Bastille Day. Mastroianni is eluding the 
cops; Lovett is chasing models; Rupert Everett is secretly selling out his 
mother's fashion house; Roberts is forced to share a hotel room with 
sportswriter Robbins; Bacall is exposing it all. And, bien sur , just about 
everyone is cheating on everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the movie's themes, Altman tries to look patient. "This is 
not a heavy film," he replies. "It's more related to French farce than to 
French fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can dress in a certain way right this minute and go to a restaurant down 
the street and they'll let me in . . . . All I can do is turn a mirror back on 
them and say this is what I see." 
</P>
<P>
 Such as the abrasive Danny Aiello character's falling asleep during a real 
Issey Miyake opening, then abruptly shattering the silence with a standing 
ovation. "All these Asian people were so polite," says Aiello, wincing at the 
recollection, "but the French, Germans and Americans were recoiling, saying who 
is this idiot? It's convincing, but it's embarrassing as hell." 
</P>
<P>
 Aiello, who plays a fashion buyer, charges through the film like a 
bargain-hunter in Macy's basement, repelling everyone he meets. At the Miyake 
show, he loudly grouses that the models "are wearing lampshades on their 
(expletive) heads." At another show, he spots Harry Belafonte and shouts across 
the hall: "Hey, Harry ! Remember me? The West Indies? The straw hat? The 
Shirley Temple? Day-o, Day-y-y-o." 
</P>
<P>
 When Altman first called to offer Aiello the role, the burly actor -- known 
for his portrayals as the muddled suitor in "Moonstruck" and the pizza-making 
mediator of "Do the Right Thing" -- had his doubts, and not only because the 
character was such a schmuck: He's also a cross-dresser. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny was scared to death it was going to be a whole sexual thing," Altman 
says, grinning. "But these scenes are not what people expect them to be. The 
restaurant where all the cross-dressers gather is very bourgeois and boring. 
We're not talking about prostitutes. We're talking about law-abiding, 
heterosexual married men who just feel more comfortable disguised as women. At 
least one night a week, they let their real personality come out and they go 
and have fun with it. " 
</P>
<P>
 At the first production meeting, Aiello had a foretaste of Altman's 
free-wheeling style. "There we were, 30 actors, egos running rampant, and Bob 
is controlling this monstrosity. First thing he says is, 'I want to start off 
by telling you all I don't know what the (expletive) I'm doing.' What does that 
do but relax you? Of course it's not true. He never makes himself seem smarter 
than you, but my feeling is also that he is smarter than everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the set at Ledoyen, a Belle Epoque restaurant across the 
Champs-Elysees from the presidential palace, Altman is constructing a master 
shot of mind-boggling complexity. As the Bulgari party swirls about them, 
Marcello Mastroianni is grasping Sophia Loren by the elbow, urgently pleading 
in Italian for something that is obviously upsetting her. Her famous cleavage, 
tanned to a deep mahogany, heaves inside her low-cut black dress. Agitation, 
amusement and longing flush her face, burning away her glacial calm. Around a 
display case, Sally Kellerman, playing an editor of Harper's Bazaar, thrusts 
her assistant in pursuit of blackmail snapshots photographer Stephen Rea has 
taken of her and other fashion editors. Meanwhile Linda Hunt, the editor of 
American Elle, is sidestepping questions from Lili Taylor, a New York Times 
investigative reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 In one corner of the salon ballroom, the director hunches down before monitors 
of the two principal cameras, fixedly observing the rehearsal. He halts it in 
mid-stream and stalks stiff-legged over to rearrange his main players and 
rechoreograph their movement. "Let's get some people through here," he shouts. 
"And please don't look at Sophia or any of the actors. Do whatever else you 
want, I don't care. It's a party." 
</P>
<P>
 On occasion, Altman will rehearse a scene one way, then during the filming, 
will throw it a curve, knocking an already improvised situation even further 
off balance. Backstage after Whitaker's show, for example, he decided to have 
Aiello pick a fight with Rea's assistant as the horrified models and 
well-wishers scattered, spilling Champagne and swearing. Except for Altman and 
the two principal actors, no one else knew of the scene in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 Seated back at the monitors, Altman squirms a bit, then calls out somewhat 
testily: "This dialogue has got to flow." Looking like a Day-Glo Madame 
Butterfly, Rossy de Palma swans by the screen in iridescent scarlet dress with 
a blue butterfly vying for space amid the gold bows and baubles in her 
coiffure. With her magnificent Dora Maar nose, the star of "Kika," "Women on 
the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown" and other Almodovar films, is a serene vision 
of the surreal. Altman's scowl dissolves into a broad smile. He ambles over to 
Kellerman. "Why don't you duck behind this case, like this," he says, 
demonstrating, "then pop up again. You have to hide, but you can't resist 
peeking either." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Kellerman, an Altman veteran since "MASH," demystifies a bit of the 
director's technique. "Bob will set up a huge master (shot) that very few 
people in the world could do, squeezing everyone into one scene and getting 
them all heard and seen. Then he says: 'Well, this probably isn't going to work 
anyway, so just go ahead and do what you do. But stay in character even though 
you probably won't be on camera.' So you say, 'OK, I might as well go ahead and 
have a good time.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The first stage in Altman's ge nius lies in persuading a smor gasbord of 
manifestly talented actors to sign on, generally taking substantial salary cuts 
for the privilege. He casts celebrities not only to attract a wider public, but 
also so that audiences have an easier time keeping the characters straight. 
"When you see Kim Basinger or Tim Robbins, you remember instantly who they're 
supposed to be," the director explains. Famously candid, Altman hooked Rea by 
telling him: "Look, this Irish photographer is a real (expletive) and I haven't 
seen you play (expletive) really." Rea accepted instantly. 
</P>
<P>
 In preparing for his role, Rea borrowed his affectation of hiding behind 
sunglasses from fashion photographer Steven Meisel, but modeled his behavior 
more on U2's Bono. "I tried to think of the cool guys in Ireland, " Rea 
explains in a liquid Belfast brogue, "so (expletive) laid-back, you know? 
There's something amusing about that kind of vanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Following her scene with the Times reporter, Hunt is positively buoyant as she 
enters the Ledoyen bar away from the filming. "At last I had something 
scripted," she exults triumphantly. Improvising dialogue has been pure torture. 
"My character comes across as rather vacant. And she got that way because for 
the first five weeks I never had a clue of what to say. I got very good at 
laughing. People would talk to me and I'd respond meaningfully: 
'Ha-ah-ha-ah-ha, yes-s-s-s,' " she cackles, her shrill voice trailing 
dementedly.  
</P>
<P>
 The Altman style, Hunt observes, is minimalist, to say the least. "He gives 
you so little. He just trusts." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before the runway scene of nude models, Altman sidles over to Whitaker to 
offer the barest advice. "Your designer probably acts like you approve of this 
stuff; it's more toward the way you think about fashion." To another actor, he 
suggests, very simply, that he look away bored when he's stuck in one 
conversation.  
</P>
<P>
 Whitaker's designer is based on Parisian anti-fashion outsider Xuly Bet, whose 
patchwork recycled clothes and headpieces tufted with blue plastic garbage bags 
make his giraffe-like models look as if they had dived head first into washing 
machines. Wearing a T-shirt with a photo of Che Guevara stretched across his 
ample frame, Whitaker's character embodies the spy in the house of fashion, an 
agitator who believes clothes should be inexpensive and make people feel 
comfortable, not inadequate.  
</P>
<P>
 Like his character, Whitaker lambastes most fashion as a form of brainwashing. 
But success brings its own pressures. "It's difficult to be anti-fashion when 
you start to become part of the Establishment," he says. "You start feeling the 
breath of the dragon." 
</P>
<P>
 Dragon breath fairly well describes Basinger's fiery attack on the Emperor's 
New Clothes send-up. As the applauding crowds press forward, the Basinger 
commentator, dressed in a scarlet velvet flared pantsuit, seeks refuge behind 
ancient Roman columns and indignantly struggles for a comment. "It's new, it's 
old, it's the bare look, for every man, woman and child. Is this fashion? I 
don't think so. It's just a bunch of naked people. What the hell am I doing? I 
have had it. You want yourself a career?" she explodes, tossing the microphone 
to her assistant, Chiara Mastroianni, daughter of Marcello. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching in the wings, Altman halts the action then crosses over to Chiara. 
"You're shocked, you're saying, 'What the hell am I supposed to do?' Then you 
take the mike." He backs off, Basinger repeats her tirade, Chiara catches the 
mike as her boss storms off. "We have seen tonight a statement of fashion in 
the profoundest sense of the word," she drones. As anyone who recalls Peter 
Finch's futile jeremiad in "Network" might have predicted, the enticing circle 
of glamour and deceit continues unbroken. 
</P>
<P>
 If Altman is right, however, the public may soon be catching on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The film could not have happened at a better time in history," he later 
argues. "Because of the vast communication of CNN and so forth, fashion is 
being overexposed -- and exposed -- in the best sense. They can't fool people 
so much any more. You can't force people to wear long skirts or short skirts. 
They'll do anything they want. 
</P>
<P>
 "The film business is worse than any of them. We make ourselves feel 
self-important about this great movie and this great actor and blah-blah-blah. 
You go in and see these silly little stories that are just stupid. These 
companies are all going to have to turn back to the artist because this stuff 
they're doing is silly and people just aren't going to see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Altman stands up to go. With bemused world-weariness, the director gives a 
philosophic shrug of the shoulders. "Things constantly change," he says, waving 
his hand in an airy oblique gesture. "We're all turned into carbon in that 
respect." Fashion, film, and other ephemera -- these too shall pass -- but 
"Pret-a-Porter" seems likely to stamp its own whimsical mark on all these 
inimitable follies.*

DANGER IS HIS BUSINESS; IT MAY NOT LOOK LIKE IT AS HARRISON FORD SITS ON THE 
FRONT PORCH OF HIS WYOMING RETREAT. BUT TRUST US: HOLLYWOOD IS A DANGEROUS 
PLACE, AND FORD HAS CERTAINLY DONE WELL IN THE ACTION GAME.. (JUST DON'T HOLD 
YOUR BREATH FOR 'FUGITIVE II.')

 "Oh, Jesus, no," Harrison Ford says, suddenly throwing the hulking tan pickup 
he is driving into reverse. 
</P>
<P>
 Instantly, Ford's jaw muscles tighten, his eyes harden, and the unmistakable 
stench of death fills the air. (Later it turns out that the unmistakable stench 
of death was actually a dumpster filled with day-old chicken bones.) "We can't 
go in there," he hisses, the unmistakable stench of fear in his voice, and it 
is only then that it becomes obvious. Harrison Ford is afraid. 
</P>
<P>
 The offer of lunch had come as Ford climbed behind the wheel, and was then 
followed by 10 minutes of circling through the narrow streets at the center of 
town, choked almost to overflowing now with the summer tourist trade. Had Ford 
fastened his seat belt? Maybe yes, maybe no. It had all happened so fast. "I 
don't really know any good places," he said, and then fell silent again. He 
seemed like he meant it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford came to this place 12 years ago, liberated from Los Angeles and the maw 
of the movie machine by the enormous success of "Raiders of the Lost Ark," a 
near-vertical ascendancy from which there would be -- could be -- no turning 
back. He and his second wife, screenwriter Melissa Mathison, looked briefly at 
Sun Valley, then drove over the Teton Pass and into the almost empty town of 
Jackson. "I preceded the first stoplight into town by about six months," he 
says, marooned briefly in a traffic jam near the new J. Crew store. "Now it's 
become the T-shirt center of the universe." 
</P>
<P>
 He is wearing jeans and a T-shirt himself, though not one of the ones that 
came out last year with his picture and the word "Fugitive" in huge black 
letters. Still, as he slips the tan tank around the corner and past the 
tightening noose of the crowds, Ford looks worried. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not until Ford finally finds a restaurant, and noses the old butte of a 
Chevy that he drives past an exit-only sign, that the trouble begins. Outside 
the restaurant Ford spots a small group of people -- international 
narco-terrorists? crypt-robbing Nazi swine? Darth Vader, party of eight? who? 
-- and begins backing into the street so fast that he narrowly avoids hitting a 
dumpster. The stench of death and fear -- and something else that you can't 
quite put your finger on -- fill the truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think, um. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford is mumbling softly, almost to himself. "I don't think that would have . . 
. ummm . . . worked out," he says. "Too many people." 
</P>
<P>
 On his infrequent trips into town, Ford walks with his neck stiff and his eyes 
riveted straight ahead, as if by refusing to engage the world peripherally he 
could ward off the intrusive stares that follow him. He is aided in this act of 
camouflage by features that have a pleasing ordinariness about them. His nose 
sits just enough off plumb to make his face consistently interesting in films. 
When he is provoked -- or afraid -- his brow descends like the cornice of a 
great mountain, and his eyes form blue lakes at the foot of this undulant 
granite mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike a lot of actors, Ford doesn't ever refer to himself as an artist, 
preferring to engage in a rear-guard campaign of reductionism, describing 
himself variously as a "worker in a service industry" and an "assistant 
storyteller." He deflects all attempts to correlate the success of his films 
with any underlying personal affection that audiences might feel for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that that's a result of a relationship not to who I am, but a degree 
of satisfaction with the product that I am part of," he says, sounding 
strangely like a vacuum cleaner salesman. "I make audience movies. I work for 
them. And I think they have a sense that I am a loyal, and to whatever degree, 
capable employee of theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, whatever. This faithful old retainer has punched the clock -- and 
anything else that got in his way -- in seven of the 20 top box-office movies 
of all time. He was named "star of the century" earlier this year by the 
National Assn. of Theater Owners, who apparently felt that with domestic ticket 
sales of more than $2 billion , Ford could spot Macaulay Culkin six years and 
still carry the title on into the millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 With "Clear and Present Danger," his second installment in the canon of 
espionage author Tom Clancy, Ford has earned ecstatic reviews for himself and 
more than $28 million for Paramount in the first five days of release. 
Audiences may just as eagerly flock to see Stallone and Schwarzenegger in their 
armor-plated adventure vehicles, but when their no-brainer formulas get even 
slightly overheated, epic disasters like "Last Action Hero" periodically 
result. On the other hand, people do not go to Harrison Ford movies, they go to 
see Harrison Ford in movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as the film version of "Clear and Present Danger" is less shrill than 
Clancy's book, Ford's portrayal of CIA analyst Jack Ryan is shaded with more 
ambiguity than the author's hero. This Ryan is vulnerable to the seductions of 
power, and he is often afraid -- vulnerability and fear being two of the 
qualities Ford is best at projecting.  
</P>
<P>
 "He's a hero, but he's also a guy you can relate to as a human being, not one 
of these all-conquering supermen," says "Fugitive" director Andrew Davis. "He 
has a vulnerability that has you cheering for him. When we were doing the scene 
at the dam in 'The Fugitive,' when he was on the edge there, ready to jump, 
Tommy Lee Jones was just standing there kind of marveling at how scared he 
looked." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford's Ryan is also so hopelessly moral that, at one point, the agency's 
corrupt director of operations dismisses Ryan contemptuously as "a Boy Scout." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford is himself a Boy Scout, having never lost the calling since he took the 
oath four decades ago in Morton Grove, Ill. Life has gotten more complicated 
since then. "I guess most often I see complexity, rather than simplicity, in 
issues," he says. "Enormous complexity. I don't think that anybody knows what 
the truth is anymore. It isn't that easy. We see these images night after night 
of Rwanda, but there's no emotional context for it. And it loses its power to 
shock and offend. I think we feel diminished by that." 
</P>
<P>
 It is Ford's job to stand next to the primordial campfire, telling stories by 
the light of a flickering projector, his sash full of merit badges. "If you can 
become involved in somebody's simple emotional circumstance, a finite 
situation," Ford says, referring to Han Solo, Indiana Jones and now Ryan, "and 
you can understand it -- if you can feel that somebody like Jack Ryan has an 
effect over his life and the situation -- that's positive. I think that's 
something worth doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, it is Ryan who has greater resonance for Ford than either Indy 
or Han Solo, the two towering serial pillars of his box-office success. With 
bullwhip and blaster, they man the flanks of his testosterone triptych, while 
Ford stands staring out from the mirror in the middle -- an ordinary man in 
extraordinary circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 "Um . . . ," says Harrison Ford. "Ummmm." 
</P>
<P>
 He is silent for a moment, the words clotted in his throat, then the quiet in 
the room lengthens into an excruciating absence. Unscripted, Ford speaks in 
sentences that often seem to have coasted to a halt, only to sputter back to 
life again after he has turned the whole thing over in his head several more 
times. When the words come, they seem to erupt from him like magma that has 
been churning just below the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 When Ford made "Mosquito Coast" in 1986, one of his few box-office failures, 
his friends were quick to note the similarities between the actor and the 
character he was playing, a crackpot moralist who moves his family from middle 
America to the middle of a tropical rain forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed when a movie makes $35 million," Ford says, "but I would do 
'Mosquito Coast II' in a minute because I loved the character. Not a lot of 
people wanted to see me play that part, but I didn't make the choice for them, 
I made it for myself, thinking that enough of them would enjoy him for the same 
reason I did. His innate intelligence, his skill with words." Ford seems to be 
considering the similarities to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Undiluted, I can reach that strength if I feel strongly enough about 
something," Ford says. "I have a degree of impatience with those things I 
consider to be inept, a degree of irritation with people I consider to be 
undisciplined, and I have thought there were things wrong with the world that 
should be fixed. Of course," he adds, "he was bent." 
</P>
<P>
 And, of course, even before the stoplight, Jackson Hole was not exactly the 
forest primeval. Ford insists that he was not running away from anything when 
he abandoned Hollywood, but to something here. "It matched the vision I had of 
what beautiful is," he says. "I always wanted to live someplace where nature 
was predominant, but truthfully, we were only looking for 10 or 20 acres. When 
we were unable to find the kind of land we wanted, I finally bit the bullet and 
bought a place much larger than I had imagined because it had everything I 
wanted. It works very well for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Even on the threshold of this wilderness, Ford has not been able to overcome 
his need to impose order. Before he can be comfortable sitting in the log cabin 
he has built among a stand of blue spruce trees, he must first carefully 
rearrange the furniture. "I have to go around and put everything back where it 
belongs because people moved things three or four inches and it makes me 
crazy," he says, embarrassed enough to note this compulsion, but not enough to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first places he takes visitors to the ranch is a stream that runs 
behind the cabin, where he sometimes fishes for native cutthroat trout. It is a 
perfect place. Ford built it to be perfect. "We dug a channel and built these 
islands," he says, "and put those trees in there with their butts buried in the 
bank to look like they fell over. That was five or six years ago, and now it 
looks dead natural." 
</P>
<P>
 Making it look dead natural on film is Ford's talent as an actor, and he 
brings to the emotional landscape of his work an excavator's eye. "What makes 
me happy is the process of getting in it up to the elbows, and seeing that it 
sucks, and trying to work my way out," Ford says. "That makes me happy, or at 
least it engages me, which is the closest I come to happiness. I don't think I 
quite understand happiness." 
</P>
<P>
 As a contract player at Columbia Pictures in the '60s, Ford received acting 
instruction from Method teachers. "I found it all quite baffling, and of no 
use," he says. "I just felt silly. I sure needed some system, some method of 
work, and I didn't have one. But I felt what I was learning in acting class was 
how to be good in acting class. It didn't have anything to do with what the job 
became once you had a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford is just beginning to be achieve the necessary gravitas to be compared to 
stars of the old Hollywood aristocracy, but all the action in his films seems 
to obscure the obvious link to the first great naturalistic screen actor: 
Spencer Tracy. "Tracy was a great dramatic actor who appeared to do everything 
very naturally too," says Mace Neufeld, producer of the Jack Ryan movies, says. 
"He was handsome, but not pretty, willing to let the scars show the way 
Harrison does. Harrison has that rare ability to project what's going on in his 
head through his eyes, without using dialogue." 
</P>
<P>
 During the filming of "Patriot Games," for example, Ford suggested eliminating 
almost all of the dialogue in a scene at CIA headquarters in which a spy 
satellite watches a raid on a terrorist base in the Middle East. As the 
terrorists are being killed thousands of miles away, the audience watches 
Ford's eyes. "The camera sits on Harrison's face for a long, long time," 
Neufeld says, "and he tells the whole story with his eyes. Very few actors 
could take that kind of close-up." 
</P>
<P>
 Ford claims not to have been influenced by Tracy's naturalness, Gary Cooper's 
marshmallow masculinity, or the men-at-work comedies of Jimmy Stewart and Cary 
Grant. "I never went to the movies very much," Ford says. "When I was very 
young I'd go to Saturday matinees, and then I didn't go to movies much until I 
was in college, dating, when the main draw was that it was, you know, dark. I 
still don't go to movies much. Maybe it's the same as not eating hot dogs after 
you've worked in a slaughterhouse. You know it's all made from ears and 
ass-parts." 
</P>
<P>
 The white house in which Ford, his wife and children -- 7-year- old Malcolm 
and 4-year-old Georgia -- live was originally intended to be the caretaker's 
quarters, but when it was finished, its dimensions seemed to fit the family so 
perfectly that one day they just moved in. (Ford also has two sons, Benjamin, 
27, a chef at Campanile in Los Angeles, and Willard, 25, who recently presented 
Ford with a grandson, Eliel.) Ford designed the house on the backs of napkins 
while he was working on "Frantic" for Roman Polanski in Paris, then sent his 
sketches by fax to his contractor every night after returning from the set. 
</P>
<P>
 Not far from the house there is a large red barn, and behind that, a corral 
made of buckboard fencing where a couple of horses stand. Ford has filled a 
large workshop with the most elaborate carpentry tools imaginable. Beyond this 
three-acre family compound, a gravel road twists back through towering blue 
spruce trees, and smaller stands of aspen and hawthorn, to the guest cottages. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford recently placed 389 of his 800 acres in perpetual trust to serve as a 
wildlife habitat, and plans to use only a couple of other small sites to build 
houses for his children. Then they will all be protected -- the sandhill 
cranes, the nesting bald eagles, the great blue heron rookery, the herds of 
elk, and Harrison Ford himself -- from the advancing encroachment of his fellow 
man. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been in a more or less constant state of retreat since he was a boy, 
trying to account for a first name that -- however suggestive of danger and 
romance it may seem now -- had the disadvantage of being merely odd then. "I 
think it's Yiddish for 'son of Harry,' " Ford says, "even though I wasn't son 
of Harry. That was my mother's father, a Russian Jew, who died in the influenza 
epidemic of 1916." His other grandfather was a blackface comedian in 
vaudeville, who died of alcoholism at the age of 25, leaving Ford's father to 
be raised in an orphanage by nuns. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was very small, Ford would often spend hours at a second-story window, 
waving at people as they passed by on their way to work in the morning, 
watching them wave as they walked home again that night. But when Ford's father 
moved the family from Chicago to suburban Des Plaines, young Harry began to 
attract a less welcome kind of attention. Day after day he was taken to the top 
of a hill by the boys his age, and pushed down it. He did nothing, and no one 
with a bullwhip ever came to his rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't so much beatings as exercises in ritual humiliation," he 
recalls. "It wasn't important that I suffer physically, just that I not think 
that I was the equal of my mates. I knew the ritual had a form and a shape to 
it, and that it was far more efficient just to tumble down the hill in a 
satisfying way and then make my way up, rather than have to fight those guys to 
get back into the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 This torment was never explained, but Ford always understood why he was being 
punished. "They might have sensed an underlying arrogance that they didn't want 
to allow to blossom," he says, smiling. "That probably came from the distance 
at which I held myself from people. And still do." 
</P>
<P>
 After four mostly disastrous years at Ripon College in Wisconsin, Ford had so 
few options -- and the implied responsibility of his impending wedding -- that 
he improvised a career choice. He would be an actor. "It was important to be 
able to announce to people what I was going to do with my life, even if it was 
only to say the thing that appalled them most," he says. "It proceeded 
naturally enough from the fact that I wasn't going to graduate from college. 
Now I was off on an adventure, with no sense really of what the odds were 
because I never knew anybody who was in that work. I don't think my family 
thought it was going to work out, but they never discouraged me. Discouragement 
was something I was always happy to have. Some resistance, you know?" 
</P>
<P>
 He found plenty of that in Hollywood, where the hills are alive with the sound 
of actors being rolled down Doheny Drive on their aspirations. There is a 
sizable legend that surrounds Ford's early struggles as an actor, but the truth 
is, he arrived with virtually no experience and was signed almost instantly by 
first one, and then another, studio to development contracts. It is true that 
he didn't become a star until he was 35, following "Star Wars," but he says now 
the thought had never occurred to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had an ambition to be a star, or thought of myself as star material," 
he says. "There wasn't anybody like me then who was a movie star. I always 
thought I was going to be a character actor, and never had a higher ambition 
than to do a TV series." 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to separate himself from the rest of the herd of young, nondescript bit 
players in TV series, Ford simply gave it up at one point and became a 
carpenter. "I told people that I wasn't available for interviews unless it was 
something really special, that I didn't want to do episodic television," he 
says. "But I never thought I was quitting the movie business. I was actually 
making a better living as a carpenter." 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 years as a carpenter, he worked on bookcases for Joan Didion and John 
Gregory Dunne, a deck for Sally Kellerman, and four movies. In 20 years of 
celebrity journalism, he has become the most famous carpenter since Jesus of 
Nazareth. "And we really don't know how good he was," says Ford, hard as 
cherrywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "He takes his work seriously, deadly serious," says Neufeld, "but he doesn't 
take himself seriously as a movie star." Ford had some difficulty early in his 
career with director Robert Aldrich when he made "The Frisco Kid" in 1978. 
Ford's part was originally intended for John Wayne, but when the Duke dropped 
out, Aldrich got stuck with the kid who would become Wayne's box-office 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think every time Aldrich looked at Harrison, he saw John Wayne," says 
Neufeld, who also produced that picture. "Harrison was aware of that, but he 
was always fun to be around, very funny. Where he's underrated is that he's a 
real filmmaker, as well as a movie star and an actor. He's involved up to his 
neck in the script, and he's always pushing to make it better." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Ford was turning 52 last month, rumors began to circulate that he was 
about to sign on for another installment in the Indiana Jones series, which he 
seems to be considering. He says he has no interest in playing Jack Ryan again 
for at least three years, perhaps five, by which time he will be nearly 60. 
Will audiences who think Keanu Reeves is buff still want to see Ford in an 
action picture in the year 2000? 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I always thought was great about this as a job is you get 
to play older people," he says, "and you get to be in different kinds of movies 
when you're an older person. But I do sometimes think I would like to do 
something else with my life besides this. The hard part is that I've never been 
able to think of what." 
</P>
<P>
 He had planned to take this year off from filmmaking, so that he could watch 
the complete cycle of the seasons at his ranch. But next month he will start 
work on Sydney Pollack's remake of "Sabrina," the 1954 comedy written and 
directed by Billy Wilder. Ford will take on the role played by Humphrey Bogart 
in the original (the Audrey Hepburn role is still uncast). "I'm always taking a 
year off," he says ruefully. "And I really mean it, and I really do try. But I 
didn't want to leave for a year's sabbatical with 'Clear and Present Danger' as 
the last thing I left on the table. I've done too many grim, anxious movies 
lately, so I wanted to do a comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Director Davis, for one, thinks the only thing that would keep people from one 
day speaking of Ford in the same breath as Tracy is his need to lighten up a 
bit. "I would love to do a comedy with Harrison -- he should play Steve 
Martin's brother," Davis says. "Having seen him when he isn't on camera, 
there's a twinkle in his character that hasn't been on screen yet. If he allows 
himself to stretch, I don't think there's any question he could be in that 
league." 
</P>
<P>
 There has also been talk of a sequel to last summer's hit "The Fugitive," but 
Ford isn't interested. "I see absolutely no way that I could be part of 
(that)," he says. "I don't see how you could create a story that would be 
interesting to me, and would proceed from what we've done. And the studio said, 
'Well, you'll understand if we try, won't you?"'  
</P>
<P>
 There also seems to be no chance for him to reprise his "Star Wars" role. "No, 
not on your life," Ford says. "The character just doesn't interest me. Han Solo 
only meant something in relationship to the callow youth that Mark Hamill 
played, he meant something in relationship to the princess. But as a character 
he was pretty thin." 
</P>
<P>
 There are rain clouds gathering across the range, and still farther away than 
he can see, a peal of thunder has begun rolling in his direction. Ford will 
take his family to the demolition derby at the Teton County Fair tomorrow, and 
if he is lucky, no one will recognize him there. There is one last, long 
silence, during which Ford's eyebrows slowly begin to knit themselves together. 
"They need somebody now to play Indiana Jones," he says, as if considering this 
for the first time, "and I'm the one whose face looks most like him."*

A FORD FILMOGRAPHY: MORE THAN JUST INDIANA JONES AND HAN SOLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanks to six mega-movies, Harrison Ford is best known as Han Solo and Indiana 
Jones. But some of Ford's other film characters are worth seeing too. Here is a 
filmography:  
</P>
<P>
 Dead Heat on a Merry-Go-Round (1966). Ford made his film debut in this drama 
about a plot to rob an airport bank.

A TRAVELER THROUGH OUR TIMES; THE PUBLIC ART OF ARCHITECT/SCULPTOR MAYA LIN 
MARKS KEY ERAS IN AMERICA: THE VIETNAM VETERANS MEMORIAL AND HER CIVIL RIGHTS

 "Hi. You're early," says Ma ya Lin hurriedly, as she appears out of the throng 
in Penn Station. 
</P>
<P>
 With that, the famed creator of the Vietnam Veterans Memorial leaves a waiting 
visitor and climbs on a hydraulic lift to the scaffolding around her newest 
public art project, some 15 feet above the crowd. Like a White Rabbit in 
Commuterland, Lin has no time to talk, on this day in late July, to anyone but 
the crew: The earthbound visitor may be early, but the project is running late. 
</P>
<P>
 Early, late. Time has been weighing heavily on the architect/sculptor as the 
deadline for her work -- an artistic focal point of the $190-million Penn 
Station renovation -- has pressed ever closer. There's a certain irony here, 
since the piece is itself about time. Designed to suggest a lunar eclipse, the 
work is part timepiece, part overhead sculpture: When "Eclipsed Time" has its 
long-delayed public unveiling in early fall, it will mark the hours for some 
250,000 people who hurtle daily through Penn Station, while providing a visual 
fulcrum between the new 34th Street entrance and the vaulted passage that runs 
east to west through the cavernous underground transportation hub. 
</P>
<P>
 What will Long Island and subway commuters see -- if they actually take the 
time to look up? A large oval form enclosing a frosted-glass disk on which the 
numbers 1 through 11 have been etched. Behind the glass disk is yet another 
disk, of brushed aluminum. 
</P>
<P>
 As the aluminum disk moves across the glass, it eclipses the numbers, until at 
midnight the disks are aligned and the work is dark, except for a soft halo; at 
noon, by contrast, the glass is completely illuminated, via a complex 
fiber-optic system that culminates in hundreds of pinpoints of light. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the plan -- elegant and artistically minimal -- and it has been 
working perfectly in Lin's Bowery studio. But there have been inevitable snags 
during the installation of the massive piece in Penn Station. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been 2 1/2 weeks of incredible stress," says Lin, relenting enough to 
allow her visitor briefly up on the scaffold. A slight figure in her chinos, 
she deals equably with the ironworkers and electricians to sort out the latest 
hitches in the schedule. Flaws have been detected in the frosted glass disk, 
and Lin is awaiting the arrival of an emergency order of "etching cream." 
</P>
<P>
 A newly discovered structural beam in the ceiling has interfered with the 
placement of a transformer box containing halogen bulbs and the box will have 
to be moved. The delay has made the architect visibly anxious, and even less 
happy than usual about being the focus of media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 An intensely private person, Lin has been celebrated for 13 years -- ever 
since she designed the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington -- for making 
public art. "It's a paradox," admits the 34-year-old artist. "I really believe 
that the work is public, but I'm not." 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe her skittishness stems from the furor she faced as a 21-year-old Yale 
architecture student when her design for a V-shaped memorial of black granite 
was selected over hundreds of other entries in a nationwide competition. It 
comes almost as a shock to recall, now that the memorial has become a virtual 
icon of its era, what anger it once stirred in those who thought it "demeaning" 
to veterans. "A black gash of shame and sorrow" is how one leader of a Vietnam 
veterans' group described it. 
</P>
<P>
 As an Asian American woman, Lin also endured personal slurs -- political, 
sexist and racist -- before the controversy died down and she was able to 
escape the limelight for a time. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet when she re-emerged, it was with another public memorial: a monument 
honoring the civil rights movement commissioned in 1988 by the Southern Poverty 
Law Center. 
</P>
<P>
 I ts 1989 dedication in Montgom ery, Ala., marked the end of her involvement 
with public memorials, Lin says: "I was fortunate enough to work on (monuments 
for) two wars of our era. With the completion of the Civil Rights Memorial in 
1989, I very happily laid that to rest." 
</P>
<P>
 She has been working since on a variety of projects, including a renovation of 
the Museum for African Art in SoHo, a sculpture commemorating more than two 
decades of undergraduate coeducation at Yale and a three-story garden of 
crushed glass for the Wexner Center for the Arts at The Ohio State University. 
She's even completing her first commissions to design private homes -- one in 
Santa Monica, the other in Williamstown, Mass. And she is pursuing her interest 
in environmental issues through contact with several groups that have been 
exploring a possible paper recycling plant in the South Bronx. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the past several weeks, all her fine-tuned energies have been 
concentrated on the Penn Station clock. Its installation marks the culmination 
of five years of effort, ever since Lin's design was selected in an 
invitational competition sponsored by the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority's Arts for Transit program. (Because of the enormous area covered by 
the renovation, two artists were chosen to enhance the look of Penn Station; 
terra-cotta bas reliefs by Andrew Leicester adorn several walls of the site.) 
</P>
<P>
 The work was judged by a panel that included artists Chuck Close and Mel 
Edwards, as well as some well-known curators and a representative of the Long 
Island Rail Road. "This was a very sophisticated panel," says panel chairwoman 
Wendy Feuer, director of the Arts for Transit program, which can allocate up to 
1% of MTA construction budgets for art in subway and railroad stations. (Given 
the scope of the Penn Station renovation, though, the art allocation was 
nowhere near 1%, Feuer notes.) "They were interested in reviewing the work of 
artists who worked environmentally, who had national and international 
reputations and whose work conceptually could encompass large and disparate 
areas," Feuer explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was that all. The design requirements, recalls Lin, included some 
important negatives: "Viewers couldn't touch it. It couldn't slow down traffic. 
It couldn't have seating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, what a challenge!," says Lin, warming quickly to her subject once 
she takes a brief break from the problems on the scaffold. "Given all these, 
how can you still communicate?" 
</P>
<P>
 The trick, as Lin puts it, was to create a "one-on-one dialogue," despite the 
limitations. In fact, all her public work -- beginning with the Vietnam 
Veterans Memorial and its thousands of inscribed names of the dead or missing 
-- has endeavored to do just that: to take the massive and public and reduce it 
to the individual and private. 
</P>
<P>
 And though "Eclipsed Time " is her first interior art installation, with 
unique problems, Lin's goal is still "creating one still moment" in the 
organized chaos of Penn Station. The concept of a lunar eclipse, both romantic 
and familiar, is her way of saying stop, look and -- if you have the time -- 
think. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's really ironic," says Lin, by now bubbling with enthusiasm, "is that 
though it deals with motion, you can't see it move. Though it deals with the 
passage of time, you'd really have to stand still to see the disk move." 
</P>
<P>
 But standing still is at a premium. Problems beckon up on the scaffold. In a 
few minutes, time's up for Maya Lin's visitor, who watches the slender figure 
in chinos weave back through Penn Station to play with time in her art.

AS POMO AS THEY CAN BE; POMO AFRO HOMOS (THAT'S POST-MODERN TO YOU) HAVE BEEN 
FIGHTING POMO NO-NOS -- RACISM AND HOMOPHOBIA. NO SURPRISE. BUT IT'S THE WAY 
THEY DO IT THAT GETS THEM THE ATTENTION AND THE LAUGHS.

 What's black and gay and playing on stages all over? 
</P>
<P>
 The Pomo Afro Homos, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 That's short for Postmodern African-American Homosexuals -- a group of funny 
guys from San Francisco who, in less than four years, have gone from tiny Bay 
Area alternative spaces like Josie's Cabaret to major venues such as New York's 
Lincoln Center. 
</P>
<P>
 They make dramatic and satiric sketches about racism, homophobia and black gay 
life. Whether taking aim at the likes of super-swishy "In Living Color" film 
critics Blaine and Antoine, or traditional psychotherapy, or telling poignant 
coming-of-age tales, the Pomo Afro Homos confront tough questions with candor 
and style. 
</P>
<P>
 The group may not be a household name yet, but it's as hot as its targets are 
provocative. They'll bring "More Fabulous Fun Stories," an evening of trademark 
irreverence in a mixed comic-serious format, to Santa Monica on Aug. 18-21, as 
part of Highway's sixth annual festival of gay and lesbian performance and 
visual art. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just one whirl on a full dance card. Though one might expect Pomo Afro 
Homos' sensitive and difficult subject matter to create a booking nightmare, 
they've been much in demand lately. The young troupe has also been racking up 
the honors, including the prestigious Bessie Award, and been well-received in 
increasingly visible places. 
</P>
<P>
 Last December, the Pomo Afro Homos -- founding members Brian Freeman, Eric 
Gupton, Djola Bernard Branner and additional performers -- appeared on Comedy 
Central's "Out There," the cable channel's gay and lesbian comedy special. More 
recently, the group took the stage at New York's Lincoln Center for their 
second year in a row as part of the Serious Fun! festival. 
</P>
<P>
 They have toured their shows "Fierce Love" and "Dark Fruit" throughout the 
United States, Canada and the United Kingdom. And the Pomos, as they're 
affectionately called, also continue to play the smaller spots where they first 
honed their brazen satire. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the only downside to the group's rapid rise is that it indicates there 
remains a need for their critique. Racism and homophobia -- the great Pomo 
no-nos -- do persist, and not just in mainstream heterosexual culture. They 
are, as the Pomos illustrate, present in the gay and African-American 
communities as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their work is important because they're telling vital black men's stories," 
says writer-performer Keith Antar Mason of the Hittite Empire, a Los 
Angeles-based all-male African American performance-art collective which 
performed on a London bill with the Pomo Afro Homos in October, 1993. 
"Homophobia in the black community is very real. (The Pomos) deal with silence, 
violence and AIDS, as we do, and they are great storytellers and great 
craftsmen. They should be heard." 
</P>
<P>
 Gupton, speaking by phone from Atlanta where the group recently was performing 
at the National Black Arts Festival, says, "Racism is never a fun topic. 
There's no easy way to talk about homophobia. Some people just can't take this 
stuff straight. Humor has always been a good way to talk about things that are 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 But once the resistance begins to crumble, the Pomos leave their mark. "There 
are usually people who are blown away that there is a reflection of their lives 
onstage," says Gupton. "Black gay people are not going away. And younger people 
should not have to throw themselves off the balconies of hotel rooms or murder 
themselves because they don't see their reflection anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pomos, who range in age from mid- to late-30s, first got together as a 
group in the Bay Area in November, 1990. Culturally speaking, it was just the 
right moment. "At that moment in time, it was a critical intersection," says 
Freeman, who had previously spent eight years performing with the San Francisco 
Mime Troupe. "There had been this rush of films -- 'Paris Is Burning,' 'Tongues 
Untied' and 'Truth or Dare' (which deal with black gay life) in a very awkward, 
manipulative way -- and books about black gay writing, like 'Brother to 
Brother,' had come out." 
</P>
<P>
 I t wasn't just coincidence that Freeman, Branner and Gupton took up the 
subject of black gay identity. "We knew a lot of these other people doing this 
work," continues Freeman, who worked on the Marlon Riggs film "Tongues Untied," 
which sparked a backlash from the political and religious right because the 
documentary on gay black men received some funding from the National Endowment 
for the Arts. "Many of them were part of a group called Black Gay United in San 
Francisco. It's a very small network of people around the country doing this 
work, primarily writers but also artists." 
</P>
<P>
 There were other reasons why this surge of artistic activity took place at 
this particular time. "It was about the gay and lesbian community entering its 
third decade (of having a high public profile) . . . and people feeling 
frustrated that there was no space for black gay and lesbians," says Freeman, 
who, like Gupton, is originally from Massachusetts. "People were working for 
AIDS organizations and trying to bring it back home, wanting to be 'out' in the 
context of the black community. It was time for there to be an 'out' black gay 
and lesbian community." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, the Pomo roster has varied a bit. Gupton took a brief sabbatical 
at one point and was replaced by Marvin White. Branner has also gone on and off 
the list, and will leave again this fall when he moves to Minneapolis. The 
group also includes White, Tony Stovalli and sometimes drag diva Joan Jett 
Blakk. 
</P>
<P>
 No matter what the lineup, the performers share a sensibility. Combining an 
emphasis on theatrical craftsmanship with humor and pathos, they offer stylish 
political theater -- only without the pedantry that term usually implies. 
</P>
<P>
 In one "Dark Fruit" spoof called "Black and Gay: A Psycho-Sex Study," the 
Pomos spin off the pulp novel genre with a "psycho-sexologist" scientist and 
the discovery that, yes, there is racism in the gay world. In the "Fierce Love" 
sketch "Good Hands," they show what happens when two men attempt to have sex in 
a back room that's not really set up for that particular activity. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also autobiographical monologues in the Pomos' shows -- including 
Branner's "Sweet Sadie" and Freeman's "Doin' Alright" -- and pointedly topical 
forays. In a "Dark Fruit" episode called "Tasty," for instance, Gupton appears 
as a naive office temp who suffers the slings and arrows of sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the overall tone of a Pomos evening is humorous, there's more to it 
than comedy. "Sometimes we're satirists and sometimes we're just real," says 
Freeman. "The comedy thing can be a bit of a burden. Some stuff just doesn't 
want that kind of treatment. Whether it comes in a funny way or just comes, we 
just want to spit it out." 
</P>
<P>
 The common thread isn't style but subject. "We all stand to learn from having 
a conversation about what it is to be black and gay," says Gupton. "We spent so 
much time identifying our differences that the work ends up illustrating the 
basic desires to have shelter, sense of community and to live in this world 
unharmed. People feel that to talk about common struggle isolates, but for me 
it seems to be a matter of cooperative venture." 
</P>
<P>
 T he challenging nature of the material is also a tribute to the Pomos' high 
opinion of its audience. "We dared to push ahead," says Freeman. "If we're 
doing a coming-out story, we approach it by assuming it's not the first 
African-American coming-out story everyone's ever heard. We assume people have 
been around, and they have. We opt for a higher consciousness." 
</P>
<P>
 Could success change them into so-so Pomos? Maybe, if they're not careful. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman says the group hasn't tailored its material to suit the mainstream. 
They prefer to raise audiences to their level instead. "We are real 
community-based artists," says Freeman. "When we're performing, it's about 
trying to evoke a sense of community. Trying to do that in (Lincoln Center's) 
Alice Tully Hall is challenging to say the least." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest change is that they're not performing for a tight-knit group of 
fellow travelers anymore. "We were playing to a mostly black gay audience at 
first," says Gupton. "Now we have families and little old ladies from 
established parts of town coming to see us, which is a wonderful surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started, I could count on knowing half the people in the audience," 
adds Freeman. "I could throw stuff in, like personal jokes. At Lincoln Center, 
I hardly knew a soul. It was a very black audience, but these were not the 
people I had seen around the community centers. It had moved beyond that core 
activist audience." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, there are other perks as well. "At first, it was intimidating," 
Branner says. of the move from small houses to large. "Then I found that I 
really like the space, being allowed to be that big. Also, it creates a space 
for other black gay performers and a black gay audience. It expands community 
in a different way." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even if the Pomos don't feel pressured to change for their audiences, they 
may evolve for themselves. "Our first show, 'Fierce Love,' was about identities 
-- that's plural because we do have different identities," says Branner. "Then 
we started trying to outline some of the problems that kept us from relating to 
larger communities, like the larger gay and black communities, and even how we 
relate interracially. 
</P>
<P>
 "We began this venture as an effort to portray the lives of black gay men 
because we had not seen those images either in theater or film or television," 
says Branner, who grew up in South Central L.A. and performs a monologue in 
"Dark Fruit" that is partly based on that experience. "We were certainly 
targeting a black gay audience. But by looking at our lives within this 
microcosm we created stories that had universal resonance and we discovered 
that our lives were as mundane as everybody else's." 
</P>
<P>
 There has been a lot of water under the bridge since 1990, and the Pomos feel 
a need to move on. For Freeman, it's a matter of changing topics. "Can I allow 
myself to move away from the question of identity and trust that these things 
will be implicit in the work and that the audience will want to make that 
journey with me?" he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for Branner, who will leave the group when he moves to Minneapolis this 
fall, a bigger shift is needed. "Personally, I'm at a point where my black gay 
identity is not the primary orientation of my work," he says. "Marlon Riggs and 
other black gay performance artists have given the community a larger 
visibility and people have been allowed to look at our identities more. The 
discussion has begun. At least people are educated enough to know that racism 
exists within the gay community and that we need to talk about it." 
</P>
<P>
 That's partly thanks to the black gay artists themselves, and to the warm 
reception that the Pomos have been given by crossover audiences. "It's 
important for people to understand the community that black gay men are trying 
to develop," says Gupton. "I strongly believe now that there is a forum for 
other black gay groups to empower themselves. We can do what we do for each 
other and, at the same time, create the space for other black lesbian and gay 
performers." 
</P>
<P>
 Black gay culture is evident elsewhere as well. "Especially in Los Angeles, 
for example, there are a number of black gay organizations now," says Freeman. 
"When we were there in 1991, there were maybe two or three. Also, there are at 
least four or five 'zines now, where in '91 there was one. And some of the 
other gay magazines will actually run an article or a  
</P>
<P>
 photo of someone who is not white and totally over muscle-bound once in a 
while." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, one of the last bas tions of resistance may be the culturally 
specific arts. "If you look at African American arts across the country, there 
are so few 'out' gay artists, even in the dance world," says Freeman. "But if 
we try and actually name a black choreographer who's heterosexual, we're gonna 
be thinking for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Black Arts Festival in Atlanta, where the group performed prior 
to Los Angeles, was been one of those places where the Pomos felt their candor 
wasn't quite welcome -- until this year, that is. This is the first year the 
group was invited to perform. "For us, it's a big telegram that said, 'Welcome 
home,' " says Freeman. "Other gay artists have been in the festival, but 
there's no hiding us. It's right there in the name. Clearly, they got the 
message. The inclusion is great and it's not tokenistic."  
</P>
<P>
 Constant self-examination keeps the Pomos on their toes. The group also shares 
an activist bent with other black gay artists such as dance-theater 
choreographer David Rousseve. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what's great about the African American performing arts community 
now," says the Hittites' Mason. "We're not just dealing with identity issues. 
We're dealing with the whole person and (the Pomo Afro Homos) help make that 
possible. People in general are more able to deal with black men's humanity."

 And that humanity is as various as that of any group. "As we announce so 
clearly in our show(s), these are just some of the stories," says Gupton. "We 
merely present the mirror, the community at large with all its flaws. What it 
should do is empower people to say you have value in your life. It may not be 
reflected in a sitcom, but you should honor it." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why artists such as Gupton, Freeman and Branner continue to challenge 
themselves, even in the face of impressive success. "I'm trying to think in 
different ways about what it is that we do," says Freeman. "We were inventing 
the whole thing three years ago all at once. Now it's (about) trusting that 
there is a hunger out there that there will be an audience for the work."*

<TEXT>
<P>
 Father Tomas Konarik is convinced the devil has run amok in the Bohemian 
countryside. The slim, 43-year-old Roman Catholic priest presides over eight 
small parishes with 33,000 souls, but he is no simple-minded backwater cleric. 
Previously, he had been posted in cosmopolitan Vienna. Yet even that modern-day 
Gomorrah, he asserts, can't match the evil that lurks in these villages some 
100 miles west of Prague. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly a week goes by without another robbery in one of Konarik's churches -- 
a Gothic Madonna, a Renaissance marble saint, Baroque angels of polychrome 
wood, silver chalices, gold crucifixes and brass candleholders. The pilferage 
and desecration happen so often that Konarik can sometimes sense when Satan's 
accomplices are about to strike again. "One Saturday, just before midnight, 
there was thunder and lightning," he recalls. "As I climbed into bed, I said to 
myself, 'They will surely come tonight.' The next day, someone phoned to tell 
me that one of my churches had been desecrated." 
</P>
<P>
 The intruders failed to break down the heavy oak door with a pick and ax, so 
they burrowed through a two-foot-thick wall in the back of the church. Among 
the several artworks they stole, the most valuable was a Baroque statue of a 
saint. "That evening, I held services at the church and told my parishioners to 
pray for the return of the saint," says Konarik. "I never expected God to 
answer so quickly." Precisely 24 hours later, the police captured the thieves 
at the German border, just as they were about to hand over the statue to a 
German accomplice believed to be acting on behalf of an antiquarian. "It was 
miracle," insists the priest. 
</P>
<P>
 Konarik has on occasion personally battled the devil's agents. On another 
stormy night, the prescient priest and several policemen tackled two thieves -- 
a 50-year-old man and his teen-age son. "We were hiding in the bushes and 
surprised them before they could break into the church," says the clergyman. 
</P>
<P>
 But neither miracles nor bravura could save the most beautiful of Konarik's 
churches, the Gothic structure that looms majestically on a hill over the 
village of Horni Slavkov. Thieves deliberately set it on fire to keep away 
parishioners. Before repairs could be done, the vandalism began. "Now, it's as 
you see it -- a total ruin," says Konarik, standing below the vaulted ceilings 
in the 200-foot-long nave, with dust and ashes soiling his black cassock. 
"Everything has been stolen. Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque statues and paintings 
-- dozens of them." Even chunks of the ornately carved altar and pieces of the 
stained glass windows are missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Konarik offers his own theological spin on the wave of robberies that has 
ravaged his country's cultural patrimony -- and a theory about when it will 
stop. "We are living at the end of a millennium," he explains. "Back around the 
year 1000, there was a rise in paganism and the church had to fight the devil. 
It's the same now. Satanic forces are taking hold of ordinary people. Only 
after the year 2000 will evil spirits subside and religion and morality rise 
again. Whether there will still be art left in our churches by then, well, 
that's hard to say." 
</P>
<P>
 THE OFFICIALS IN CHARGE OF SAFEGUARDING Czech cultural treasures share Father 
Konarik's doubts that the art thefts can be brought under control before the 
next millennium. But they offer more secular explanations for the tragic 
phenomenon. With the fall of Communism, the country's borders have been flung 
open, making smuggling easy and giving collectors and dealers in the West 
access to long unavailable artworks. Less fearful of the police, criminals are 
more brazen, often operating as a version of the more notorious Russian mafia. 
And unprotected churches, castles and museums make inviting targets. 
</P>
<P>
 Czechs are not the only victims. All of Eastern Europe is being stripped by 
bands of thieves operating on orders from Western collectors and dealers, or 
using middlemen to place their booty abroad. "These countries are rich in 
artifacts," says Constance Lowenthal, executive director of the New York-based 
International Foundation for Art Research, which keeps track of stolen 
artifacts around the world. "Western European dealers are interested in new 
merchandise -- or merchandise new to their market -- and not terribly concerned 
about how it comes to them. And people in these countries desperately need hard 
currency. Put it all together and you have today's disastrous situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts such as Lowenthal believe the looting in Eastern Europe has reached 
proportions comparable to the ransacking by the Nazis and the Soviet army. 
Estimated in the hundreds of millions of dollars, the spoils include sacred art 
ripped from church altars, as well as paintings, sculptures, tapestries, 
manuscripts and rare coins raided from museums and castles. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, robberies are spectacular enough to spur police to make 
exceptional efforts. Last December, about 200 artifacts were stolen from the 
Budapest Jewish Museum, virtually stripping Hungary of its most valuable 
historical inventory of Judaica. But in July, police in Bucharest, Romania, 
were able to recover most of these works. The year before, a remarkable 
collection of Russian icons and 19th-Century paintings was intercepted in the 
Czech Republic en route to Vienna. And in November, 1992, German police 
recovered eight paintings by Renaissance master Lucas Cranach the Elder that 
had been stolen from the Weimar Museum in the former East Germany a month 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, the thieves steer clear of artworks renowned enough to 
appear in international registeries or catalogues, and concentrate on less 
traceable objects. In January, 1992, thieves stole seven small ancient Roman 
and Greek bronzes dating from the 1st Century from a museum in Vidin, Bulgaria. 
In Poland, icons dating from the 14th to 17th centuries were taken from a 
monastery in Jableczna in September, 1990. In Bucharest, an unknown and 
unregistered Renaissance painting attributed to Rubens was stolen from a 
private collection in June, 1993. And in Russia, 14 paintings by several 
19th-Century Russian painters were taken from a museum in Sochi in May, 1992. 
None of the cases, picked randomly from Interpol files, have been solved. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the former Communist European countries, the Czech Republic has suffered 
the greatest losses -- and has also embarked on the most ambitious effort to 
stanch the hemorrhage. The Culture Ministry estimates that 50,000 objects, 
worth more than $100 million, have been smuggled abroad since 1990. In their 
attempt to bring this pilferage under control, the Czechs are training 
hard-nosed cops as art connoisseurs and turning cultural officials into 
security experts. The campaign has largely been coordinated by two men, 
Jaroslav Zavadsky and Pavel Jirasek, as odd a couple as one can imagine. 
</P>
<P>
 Major Zavadsky heads the Czech national police force's art squad. He works out 
of Criminal Police Headquarters, one of the sterile, modern eyesores built by 
Communist planners on the outskirts of Prague, far from the city's famed 
Renaissance palaces and Baroque churches. He became a cop in 1971 when the 
Communist regime was at its most repressive stage. Starting on a street beat, 
he made his way up the ranks to detective of homicides and robberies. Then, in 
what had to seem like a demotion, he was appointed the country's sole 
investigator of art thefts in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were so few cases that I could handle them myself," says the 
46-year-old major, his graying hair razor-trimmed and his black linen jacket 
rolled up at the sleeves a la Don Johnson in "Miami Vice." The only art thefts 
back then were carried out by ranking Communist officials or their proteges who 
sold pieces mainly to foreign diplomats stationed in Prague. "I was told not to 
investigate those cases," says Zavadsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Nowadays, he has eight full-time investigators, and can call upon 240 police 
officers across the country who have been given brief, very rudimentary courses 
in art history and identification at museums and universities. "The instruction 
is adequate for our purposes," says the major. "It makes more sense than trying 
to train an art historian as a detective." 
</P>
<P>
 Zavadsky's office walls are plastered with reproductions of Old Masters -- all 
of them stolen. His desktop computer tracks many more missing artworks, with 
details on where and when they were looted. The recovery rate, he concedes, is 
abysmal -- "maybe 8 or 9%." And in his hands is a fresh fax, reporting another 
art theft over the weekend or perhaps earlier, this time from a church near the 
city of Brno, southeast of Prague. 
</P>
<P>
 "Typical case," says Zavadsky. "There were 13 objects stolen -- Baroque 
angels, a crucifix and candleholders. We don't know when the thieves broke into 
the church. There are no photos of what the pieces look like. By now, they're 
probably over the border, in Germany or Austria." The major shrugs and crushes 
out his fifth cigarette of the morning interview. "But I'll probably bring this 
up with Jirasek when we meet this afternoon," he adds. "We may need more of his 
security systems around Brno." 
</P>
<P>
 Pavel Jirasek, 33, advises the Ministry of Culture on electronic devices to 
safeguard museums, castles and major churches, and on software programs to 
catalogue artworks and identify stolen objects. His tousled blond hair, sleepy 
eyes, rock-band T-shirt and suit jacket that doesn't match his pants convey the 
impression that he bolted out of bed to make his office appointment. He works 
out of a restored Renaissance palace, and his window overlooks an inner 
courtyard adorned with bronze replicas of Greek mythological figures sculpted 
by the late 16th-Century artist Adriaen de Vriese. The originals were stolen by 
Swedish soldiers during a 17th-Century war and are on display near Stockholm -- 
a reminder, says Jirasek, that the looting of Czech art has a long history. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 1989 Velvet Revolution, Jirasek was a computer expert at a large 
state-owned factory and a frequent visitor to art museums after work, 
particularly when foreign exhibits were on display. He was among the huge 
throngs who braved the police at Prague's Wenceslas Square in the waning days 
of Communism. As a dissident, he dreamed about a new era of free cultural 
exchange between his country and the West. But he has discovered that cultural 
exchange can be a one-way nightmare. "I never imagined I'd be spending my time 
trying to keep art from being smuggled abroad," he says. "It has been one of 
the paradoxes of becoming a more open, democratic country." 
</P>
<P>
 Zavadsky and Jirasek were first brought together in May, 1991, when four 
Picassos were stolen from the National Gallery. The thieves broke into the 
museum after making their way at night across the adjoining gardens of Prague 
Castle, once the impregnable fortress of Communist rulers and now the much less 
guarded palace of President Vaclav Havel. The intruders used a bench from the 
museum garden to smash through a window. They chose the smallest Picassos they 
could find, apparently because they were easier to carry, and fled before 
police arrived, less than five minutes after the break-in began. The paintings 
were from the artist's early Cubist period, and their market value was 
estimated at $30 million by gallery officials. 
</P>
<P>
 From the beginning of the investigation, Zavadsky was convinced the criminals 
were former black marketeers. "Under Communism, they were money changers and 
smugglers," says the major. "They have kept their contacts abroad, and have 
moved smoothly into art thefts." Dozens of suspects were repeatedly picked up 
for questioning, and finally, in July, two months after the robbery, four men 
with long rap sheets as black marketeers were arrested and confessed. Three 
Picassos were found in an apartment of a relative of one of the thieves. The 
fourth canvas was retrieved by German police from the baggage deposit at 
Bayreuth's train station. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the paintings were too famous to go on public sale," says 
Zavadsky. "So the thieves were planning to sell them to a private collector in 
Germany. They sent one of the works to Bayreuth as a first step -- to show the 
collector that they really had the art." The thieves are serving prison 
sentences of four to eight years. They told the police they never knew the name 
of the collector, dealing instead with an intermediary who used an alias and 
vanished as soon as he realized the arrests had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 The Picasso case, Jirasek says, served as a wake-up call for the government 
and the public on a problem that was just reaching epidemic proportions. "It 
couldn't happen again," he says confidently. "We immediately installed tough 
security systems for our most important museum collections." Eventually, 5,000 
cultural properties, including museums, libraries, palaces, castles and 
churches will be electronically wired to police stations and their collections 
will be photographed and catalogued. 
</P>
<P>
 THE PROGRAM HAD NOT YET been extended to Namesti nad Oslavou, a historic 
castle near Brno, where thieves broke in and stole 14 Old Masters, among them 
works by Bellotto and Canaletto, in early 1992. The robbery took place during 
the off-season when the castle was closed to the public and only a skeleton 
caretaker staff was on hand. The intruders climbed up to the castle tower along 
a lightning-rod grounding cable. "It was a very professional job," says 
Zavadsky. "The thieves were very knowledgeable -- they stole only the best 
paintings. And they cased the castle very thoroughly." Even now, Zavadsky 
doesn't know the number of criminals involved, or how many days passed before 
the robbery was discovered. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a year later, a London art dealer contacted Constance Lowenthal at 
the International Foundation for Art Research. He had been offered a Bellotto 
canvas of a view of Milan for $4 million by a man who claimed it came from the 
private collection of an old aristocratic Czech family. "The dealer asked if 
the painting was registered with us," says Lowenthal. She told him it fit the 
description of a work taken from Namesti nad Oslavou. Suspecting that the 
dealer had alerted the police, the Czech smuggler disappeared with the 
Bellotto. Along with the 13 other paintings, its whereabouts remain a mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's perfectly possible for major works like these to be almost unknown to 
Old Master dealers in the West," says Lowenthal. "They were never loaned for 
major exhibitions abroad. They weren't even published in catalogues. They 
probably weren't even seen by foreign art historians because under the 
Communists it was very difficult to get permission to visit cultural sites 
outside of Prague, especially if they were near a military installation. So a 
lot of these stolen works get passed on to dealers with very touching but fake 
stories of distressed families who had to sell their heirlooms or found the 
paintings in an attic." 
</P>
<P>
 What lends credibility to many of these tales is the well-publicized return of 
exiled aristocrats to reclaim their estates and art in the Czech Republic. 
After the Communist collapse, the new government passed legislation enabling 
the former nobility to take back castles and the valuable cultural collections 
on their premises. "The law isn't meant to distinguish between a factory, a 
house or a castle -- it simply covers all property unjustly seized from their 
owners by the Communists," says Jara David-Moserova, a former parliamentarian 
who chaired the committee that pushed through the restitutions. "Old, 
traditional families tend to have a strong emotional bond with their castles, 
and the feeling is that they will do a better job than the government in 
protecting their properties." 
</P>
<P>
 But the property transfers often take years to negotiate, and in the interim, 
the government has drastically cut security at the castles. Even aristocrats 
who manage to recover their estates often don't have the financial resources to 
carry out extensive repairs and pay for the personnel and alarm systems 
necessary for their protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the case of the Lobkowicz family, aristocrats who were forced into exile 
by both the Nazis and Communists, who will eventually receive nine castles in 
the Bohemian countryside north of Prague. The family, which took up residence 
in Boston more than four decades ago, is by no means wealthy and has sought 
foundation funds to convert several of the estates into art museums and 
classical music centers. They have assigned priority to Nelahozeves, a 
16th-Century castle built in Italian Renaissance style. The castle's formidable 
art collection, including paintings by Velazquez, Brueghel, Cranach and Rubens, 
has been opened to the public and appears well protected by private security 
guards as well as electronic alarms. 
</P>
<P>
 But another Lobkowicz property, Roudnice -- a 200-room, Baroque-style castle a 
few miles away -- still houses Czech army troops while negotiations for its 
return to the family continue. In the meantime, whatever sacred art remained in 
its chapel has been looted. And at other nearby Lobkowicz castles, valuable 
manuscripts and furniture have been stolen in the last two years, before new 
security measures could be put in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all of the returning aristocrats appear as committed as the Lobkowicz 
family to preserving their cultural treasures. "Many of them take no 
precautions against robberies," says Michal Benes, a senior official in the 
Culture Ministry. "They know so little about their collections that they can't 
even describe what has been stolen." Others know the value of heirlooms only 
too well. A countess who recovered an extensive collection of antique furniture 
immediately sold it to smugglers, according to Benes. Another case cited by 
Benes involved an Oriental collection that had been loaned to the National 
Gallery by its owner decades ago to keep it from being expropriated by the 
Communists. It was recently taken back by some of her heirs and quickly sold 
before other family members could ensure that the collection be kept on public 
display. 
</P>
<P>
 THE RICHEST -- AND MOST vulnerable -- portion of the nation's cultural 
heritage lies in the churches. The Counter-Reformation that crushed a 
Protestant movement and brought Hapsburg rule to the country in the 1620s 
sparked an explosion of Baroque art. "Those passionately sculpted angels and 
Madonnas and saints were the 'propaganda' used to convert us back to 
Catholicism," says Jiri Setlik, vice rector of the Academy of Arts, 
Architecture and Design. "It was a time that also saw a great flourishing of 
architecture. Many Gothic and Renaissance churches and castles were renovated 
as the Baroque structures you see today." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of this huge inventory of sacred art escaped the destruction wrought in 
neighboring countries during World War II. Because Czechoslovakia was annexed 
by the Nazis before the conflict started, relatively few of its cultural 
treasures were taken back to Germany as trophies. And toward the end of the 
war, the Germans retreated before the onrushing Red Army without engaging in 
major battles on Czech soil. Then, under the Communists, some of the most 
prized sacred artworks were transferred to museums, but the bulk remained in 
the churches. 
</P>
<P>
 "As you would expect, crime was very low under the dictatorship," says Msgr. 
Evernod Geyza Sidlovsky, who, as a personal aide to Cardinal Frantisek Tomasek 
during the last years of Communist rule, kept track of the church's cultural 
property. "It wasn't even necessary to guard churches -- people stayed away 
from them because they didn't want to be considered politically suspect. Now, 
the churches are an El Dorado for criminals. They can steal from almost any 
church." 
</P>
<P>
 Providing protection to the thousands of churches and chapels spread around 
the country "is an impossibility," concedes Pavel Jirasek, the Culture 
Ministry's security aide. The clergy shrank under four decades of Communism, 
and there are now less than a fifth the number of priests as at the beginning 
of this century. "That means you have a single priest for 10, 15, sometimes 20 
parishes," says Jirasek. "Between services, there is nobody to look after those 
churches." 
</P>
<P>
 Zavadsky estimates that 90% of his cases involve churches. "So much is stolen 
that we only concentrate on the most valuable objects -- a Renaissance 
painting, certainly, or a Gothic Madonna that has been worshiped by pilgrims 
for centuries," he says. Otherwise,much of his time out of the office is spent 
visiting parishes to commiserate with priests and encourage them to install 
multiple locks on their church doors and bar their windows. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent weekday, he drove in his own Skoda with a colleague to Zbraslav, a 
village just south of Prague, where a local church, called St. Gallen, has been 
repeatedly robbed. Built in the 11th Century, the small Romanesque church 
perches on a hill above the village and its hop fields and forests. Surrounded 
by an ancient graveyard, St. Gallen is used nowadays exclusively as a funeral 
chapel. "We usually find out about a new robbery only when someone dies," says 
Father Bedrich Tupa, the 80-year-old priest who presides over funeral services 
at St. Gallen and has five other churches to look after. 
</P>
<P>
 After the last theft, Tupa ordered a half-dozen locks for St. Gallen's front 
door, and today, unfortunately, he has misplaced one of the keys. Zavadsky 
thrusts his hands in his pockets, grimaces and looks skyward. He drives Father 
Tupa back to his rectory, and after an hour they return with the missing key. 
It's cold and musty inside the chapel. Thieves have taken all of the statuary 
-- polychrome angels and saints from the Baroque period -- and even the altar, 
except for its base. The few paintings they have left behind are of poor 
quality and date back no more than a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Zavadsky's colleague, Detective Jaroslav Zahalka, has been handling the St. 
Gallen case, and Father Tupa asks him if he's made any progress on the 
robberies. "If the perpetrators are part of a very active gang, we may get them 
eventually," Zahalka replies. "But not the artifacts -- too much time has 
passed." 
</P>
<P>
 Back at his rectory, the priest plies his visitors with coffee and wine, and 
apologizes for the long delay in getting St. Gallen's door open. But Zavadsky 
reassures him no harm was done, and tells him he wishes all churches were as 
battened down. Walking to his car, Zavadsky fumbles through his pockets but 
fails to locate his key. He has left it in the ignition. "My God!" he exclaims, 
slapping his face with both hands. "Anybody could have taken the car." He 
drives back to Prague muttering about the consequences had a bank robber used a 
car stolen from a police major to pull a heist. 
</P>
<P>
 AS FRUSTRATIONS RISE OVER THE inability to stop the looting, more attention is 
being focused on foreign buyers of Czech stolen art. It's no secret that most 
of these artifacts make their way into antique stores and private collections 
in neighboring Germany and Austria, countries with Baroque artistic traditions 
similar to those in the Czech Republic. Neither Germany nor Austria are 
signatories of the 1970 UNESCO convention prohibiting "the illicit import, 
export and transfer of ownership of cultural property." In both countries, laws 
allow a collector or dealer to keep stolen art if purchased "in good faith" -- 
that is, supposedly with no knowledge that it was stolen. "The Germans and 
Austrians have a shortsighted policy in not preventing illegal art from being 
collected in their countries," says Michal Benes, the Czech Culture Ministry's 
liaison with UNESCO. "Someday, the situation may change. Today, we're the 
victims. Tomorrow, it may be their turn to lose their art patrimony." 
</P>
<P>
 Other close observers of the Czech cultural scene sound even more exasperated. 
"I can walk down the streets of Munich and Vienna and point out art in the 
antique shops that is clearly Czech," says Wendy Luers, president of the New 
York-based Foundation for a Civil Society that, among its other activities, 
promotes cultural preservation in the Czech Republic and Slovakia. "As far as I 
know, there is absolutely no control over what is being sold. What the hell are 
the German and Austrian governments doing about it? It's necessary to light a 
fire under their ambassadors in Prague." 
</P>
<P>
 Pavel Jirasek insists that the Czech foreign and culture ministries have 
strongly complained to the German and Austrian governments. "We're certainly 
not satisfied with their efforts," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps these protests have bypassed the German and Austrian embassies in 
Prague, neither of which report any pressure from the Czech government over 
smuggled art. "In the two years I've been here, I've never heard of any 
representation made to us on the subject," says Christiana Markert, press 
officer at the German Embassy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Czechs also can be just as remiss as their neighbors in clamping down on 
art smuggled into their country from other Eastern European nations. Jirasek 
estimates that roughly 10,000 such cultural objects are transported through the 
Czech Republic every year, and concedes that many of them end up being sold 
here. The most notorious black market for foreign art is held every weekend 
about 90 miles west of Prague in Karlovy Vary, the famous spa town formerly 
known as Carlsbad. On a recent Saturday evening, hundreds of cars were parked 
along the highway outside the city's empty sports stadium. Their owners were 
Russians, Poles, Slovaks and Hungarians offering a treasure trove of icons, 
religious statuary, antique furniture, even cuckoo clocks, from the hoods and 
trunks of their vehicles. If any police were around, they weren't wearing 
uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Zavadsky says he is well aware of the city's black market, but claims that 
arrests aren't made because it is difficult to prove the merchandise is stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's harder to explain why the Czechs seem unable to prevent illegal art 
sales in their own antique shops. At the Culture Ministry, Daniela Vokolkova is 
an art historian in charge of keeping tabs on stolen artifacts among Prague's 
antiquarians. From her file cabinet, she withdraws a packet of about 100 
photographs of sacred artworks -- Madonnas, crucifixes, angels -- sent to her 
by local antique dealers who are seeking certificates from the ministry 
attesting that the works came from private collections and can thus be legally 
sold. "The stories about their provenance sound very believable," says 
Vokolkova. "In fact, almost all the pieces are stolen from churches. So I'm 
certainly not going to recommend they be given certificates." 
</P>
<P>
 But Vokolkova blanches when asked if she intends to turn over the photographs 
to the police art squad as evidence. "I'm afraid," she says, running her 
fingers nervously through her long, loose hair. "I've received threatening 
phone calls from the mafia. I don't even visit the antique shops anymore 
because I'm scared I'll be recognized." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhat skeptical, I ask Pavel Jirasek if Vokolkova is exaggerating. He 
explains that the Czech mafia isn't nearly as violent as the Russian underworld 
and that there have been no reported murders linked to the art trade. "But 
unfortunately, the mafia scares many people," says Jirasek. "And she lives 
alone with her two children." Would he be scared by anonymous phone calls? 
"Well, no," he responds, "but I'm a man." 
</P>
<P>
 On parting, Vokolkova points me in the direction of some well-known antique 
shops where she says I'm bound to find stolen articles. Most of these 
antiquarians are located in Prague's Old Town, across the Charles Bridge, a 
magnet for tourists. At a nearby rare bookstore, I come across 16th- and 
17th-Century Venetian texts -- one a history of Augustus Caesar, the other a

 In an antique shop a block away, there are several Baroque polychrome wood 
angels and Madonnas that show clear signs of having been ripped off a wall or 
altar.

 The dealer claims that they come from private collectors -- hard-pressed 
aristocratic families who had chapels in their castles. When I ask the price 
for a Madonna, he quotes several thousand dollars, but quickly adds that a 
recent law forbids him from selling objects of such high cultural value to 
foreigners. "Why not have a Czech friend buy it for you?" he proposes. "Then 
take it back to America."

THOM GUNN'S SENSE OF MOVEMENT; HE LEFT ENGLAND A GENERATION AGO TO SEEK A NEW

 "I got the idea for these poems from Patricia Highsmith's wonderful article 
about Jeffrey Dahmer. What fascinated me -- this stood out in the article -- 
was that Dahmer got this feeling, 'I'm never going to see him again, the most 
important person in my life,' about the guy he had known for only 20 minutes, 
who was getting ready to leave. So he came up behind him and killed him. I 
mean, if you want to possess somebody, what better way than to kill them?" 
</P>
<P>
 Thom Gunn and I are sitting in a San Francisco restaurant, talking about his 
Jeffrey Dahmer poems, a sequence of four published under the title 
"Troubadour." The poems, in somewhat gruesome detail, contemplate Dahmer's 
murderous acts from the killer's point of view. "I rather like upsetting 
people," Gunn admits. "I've always had a childish desire to shock. But I didn't 
really think those poems would upset people as much as they did. They weren't 
conceived of as being about somebody crazy, but about someone who experiences 
the things we do, only in more extreme form. I think of them as love poems." 
</P>
<P>
 He published the Dahmer poems shortly after winning a MacArthur Fellowship in 
1993. Perhaps, I suggest, he wanted to show that he was still allied with the 
"undesirables" (as he titled a book of poems about street people, derelicts and 
other marginal types). Perhaps he felt guilty about winning America's biggest 
literary prize. 
</P>
<P>
 "No," he says flatly. "I don't feel at all guilty about the MacArthur. I do 
feel guilty about having a house whenever I pass by street people. But doesn't 
everyone feel that way?" 
</P>
<P>
 There is something boyishly charming about Thom Gunn's assumption that 
everyone is exactly like him. But then, there is something boyishly charming 
about Thom Gunn in general. Though he will be 65 on his next birthday, he is 
still thin and energetic, bounding up and down two flights of stairs at a 
moment's notice to retrieve a forgotten jacket or fetch a spare copy of a poem. 
His face is strongly lined, and his hair is in transition from black to gray 
(about the stage of Richard Gere's in "Internal Affairs," a movie Gunn much 
admires), but with his earring, tattoo, T-shirts and jeans, he conveys the 
impression of someone who has never really aged. Even his laugh is sudden, 
open, childishly joyful -- as well as loud enough to triumph over the din at 
any restaurant in San Francisco, his home since 1961. 
</P>
<P>
 Thom Gunn has always had a big, loud laugh. Karl Miller, a classmate at 
Cambridge University in the early 1950s (later the founder of the London Review 
of Books), wrote of those Cambridge days: "A great pleasure of the place was to 
watch Thom Gunn, of the sounding, crashing laugh and lumberjack shirts, become 
a poet." The lumberjack shirts have long since been discarded, and the process 
of becoming a poet has been satisfyingly, definitively accomplished, but the 
laugh remains. And these days, with the recent MacArthur fellowship and his 
"Collected Poems" just out, Gunn has a lot to laugh about. 
</P>
<P>
 The level of fame is new, but the spotlight has been on Thom Gunn from a 
relatively early age. By the time he was 25, he had published his first book, 
"Fighting Terms," and had been welcomed into the company of a new generation of 
British poets that included Philip Larkin, Donald Davie and Britain's current 
poet laureate, Ted Hughes. In 1989, a prominent critic putting together a book 
about British poetry since 1960 kept noticing "how insistently Thom Gunn 
shouldered to centre stage." At least a few Gunn poems made it into virtually 
every anthology of contemporary British verse, and some were even included in 
the standard O-level and A-level tests that determined a student's passage from 
secondary school to university. 
</P>
<P>
 If you know a privately educated Englishman of a certain age -- say, 35 to 60 
-- he will likely be able to recite from memory at least a few lines by Thom 
Gunn, the likeliest being a passage from the famous "On the Move." The lead 
poem in his second collection, "The Sense of Movement" (1957), "On the Move" 
describes an alluringly ominous group of Hells-Angels-like bikers: 
</P>
<P>
 " On motorcycles, up the road, they come: Small, black, as flies hanging in 
heat, the Boys. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 As if to signal that he too was on the move, Gunn himself briefly rode a 
motorcycle (though not until after he'd written this reputation-making poem). 
"I rode it to show off," he now says, "and I had it less than three months. I 
shouldn't be trusted on the road. That's why I don't drive a car. I think my 
reflexes are funny." 
</P>
<P>
 One Englishman who has been a fan of Gunn since the 1950s is 
neurologist-writer Oliver Sacks. "My battered copy of 'The Sense of Movement' 
goes back to -- let's see, 1958," he notes. "Jonathan Miller, who was a friend 
of mine, said, 'You must read this.' " Sacks subsequently ventured to San 
Francisco for a couple of years of medical training, choosing the location in 
part because Thom Gunn was already there. "I met him in 1961," recalls Sacks, 
who now lives in New York, "and I saw a fair amount of him during my brief San 
Francisco days, which ended in 1962. But I've kept in touch with him since. And 
whether as a grand poet or the best of friends, he's someone I very much love 
and admire." 
</P>
<P>
 But during these same decades, most literate Americans -- even most American 
fans of poetry, which is a far smaller group -- had barely heard of Gunn. Poet 
Elizabeth Bishop, writing to her mentor, Marianne Moore, from San Francisco in 
1968, felt obliged to explain who he was, even though by this time he had 
already published five books ("My Sad Captains" came out in 1961, "Touch" and 
"Positives" in the mid-1960s). "One poet I've met here, almost a neighbor, I 
like very much, Thom Gunn," she wrote. "His poetry is usually very good, I 
think; he's English but has lived here for a long time." Gunn's opinion of 
Bishop was equally enthusiastic. "She was jolly and hearty and liked a good 
joke," he remembers. "And she gave the only really good literary party I ever 
went to." 
</P>
<P>
 FROM 1972 ON, THOM GUNN HAS EKED OUT A LIVING AS A PART-TIME LECTURER in UC 
Berkeley's English department, having given up a tenured position there because 
he couldn't stand going to department meetings. He had no health insurance, no 
retirement plan, not even a single credit card (until, in the 1980s, he finally 
acquired one so he could purchase airline tickets over the phone). He lived 
frugally, almost never buying new clothing or hardcover books. His only 
tangible asset, a house in the Haight-Ashbury district, had been purchased in 
1971 with a $3,300 down payment carved from his $10,000 Guggenheim grant; he 
shared the mortgage costs among several rent-paying housemates. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not, however, a tale of penurious merit ultimately rewarded, of 
ascetic renunciation for the good of Art. This is the tale of choices 
consciously made on the basis of immediate as well as lasting desires; of 
pleasures experienced and enjoyed; of a life explored and inhabited so as to 
render up its manifold possibilities. During all those years, Thom Gunn was 
having a ball -- particularly in the late '60s and early '70s, San Francisco's 
hippie heyday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked LSD because it broke down categories," Gunn says now. "But that was 
what I liked so much about the '60s anyway. By your mid-30s, you can get a bit 
smug, and the '60s -- and by this I mean the drugs, the concerts in the park, 
all of it -- turned over my assumptions, delayed my middle-aged smugness a 
little." 
</P>
<P>
 The poems that came out of this period of discovery and self-discovery -- 
poems about LSD, communal orgies, gay bath houses, rock-star deaths, 
fragmentary memories, nightmarish visions and the Northern California 
landscape, urban and rural -- took up much of the space in Gunn's next three 
books, "Moly" (1971), "Jack Straw's Castle & Other Poems" (1976) and "The 
Passages of Joy" (1982).  
</P>
<P>
 These books did not endear him to his English public. The prevailing sense (as 
wittily summarized by Glyn Maxwell, a younger British poet) was that here was 
"a man of decorous, skillful, metrical verse who had for his own reasons become 
absorbed into an alien culture that gave him alien subjects (like sex), alien 
backdrops (like sunshine) and, most vexing of all, made his strict forms melt 
on the page. No longer could he be Our Man Out There like, say, Auden in New 
York or James Fenton in the Far East, because he seemed to have become Their 
Man Out There." 
</P>
<P>
 To an extent, this was the point of the whole endeavor: to escape being 
English. The freedom Gunn gained in 1960s San Francisco was in part the freedom 
to stop being what he had been brought up to be and become something else, 
something far less easily defined. He says as much in the last few lines of 
"The Geysers": 
</P>
<P>
 " torn from the self in which I breathed and trod I am I am raw meat I am a 
god " 
</P>
<P>
 Or, if not a god, then at any rate a Californian; at the very least an "Anglo 
American," as he now calls himself, in imitation of the models of ethnic 
immigration -- Italian American, Hispanic American, Asian American -- that can 
be found so profusely in California. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not true, however, that California made all of Gunn's British strictness 
melt away. As a teacher at UC Berkeley, for instance, "he was extremely 
rigorous," says dance critic Joan Acocella, who took Gunn's undergraduate 
English 100 in 1965. "He made us write a two-page paper every week -- he was 
very strict about the two-page limit -- and he always expected from us more 
sophistication than the other professors did. He gave us idiosyncratic material 
-- more difficult, less lovable than the usual -- and then he gave us his 
reasons for liking it, which were bound up with his moral personality: his 
reserve, his distance. I'll never forget what he taught me. He was great." 
</P>
<P>
 The students also found Gunn himself idiosyncratic, and that too appealed to 
them. Unlike the other professors, Acocella remembers, "He wore leather, he was 
a poet, we had heard that he was gay, and we knew that he took the bus back to 
San Francisco every day." (To this day, Gunn takes the bus back and forth one 
semester each year to teach at Berkeley. He hasn't allowed any of his recent 
fellowships to interfere with his scrupulous, devoted teaching; once, in fact, 
he nearly turned down a three-year fellowship when it seemed he would have to 
stop teaching to accept it.) 
</P>
<P>
 The rigor that characterized his teaching was also there, if less obviously, 
in his California-influenced poetry. He may have ceased to be wholly British, 
but he could still produce "decorous, skilled, metrical verse." Though the 
three books of the '70 and '80s contain a great deal of free-verse 
experimentation, they also contain a substantially higher proportion of rhyme 
and meter than most American poets were using at that time. Even in the lines 
I've quoted from "The Geysers," you can hear both the rhyme (of "trod" and 
"god") and the old-fashioned, Shakespearean iambic pentameter ("I am I am raw 
meat I am a god ") .  
</P>
<P>
 Explaining why he chose to use meter when writing about his LSD experiences, 
Gunn has written, "The acid trip is unstructured, it opens you up to countless 
possibilities, you hanker after the infinite. The only way I could give myself 
any control over the presentation of these experiences, and so could be true to 
them, was by trying to render the infinite through the finite, the unstructured 
through the structured." 
</P>
<P>
 But this particular use of structure did not appeal to those who had formerly 
praised Gunn's energy and adventurousness when similar metrical forms were 
applied to subjects like soldiers, bikers and figures from Greek myth. What 
really bugged the British critics was Gunn's unashamed focus on pleasure and 
enjoyment; "good news is no news," as one reviewer in the Times Literary 
Supplement wryly put it. It was not until Thom Gunn's next book, "The Man with 
Night Sweats" (which came out in England in 1992), that the British wanted to 
hear what he had to report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that HIV and AIDS have turned Gunn's home into a place to which we do 
send correspondents, at least when we feel up to it," the TLS review continues, 
"there he still is, an exceptional and fascinating poet with a formal range to 
rival Auden's, a sensuality equal to Ginsberg's and a profound yet daily 
humanity that surely surpasses that of any other poet of our times." 
</P>
<P>
 That ringing endorsement was sounded in March of this year, in a review of 
Thom Gunn's "Collected Poems." When I read the praise aloud to fiction writer 
Leonard Michaels, who has taught with Gunn at UC Berkeley for almost three 
decades, he shrugs with disdainful pity for the previously unenlightened. 
"Haven't I been saying exactly that all along?" he says with his characteristic 
Lower East Side inflections. Another shrug, as if to say, who could miss it? 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody, at the moment. Since 1990, when he was in the first round to receive 
the generous ($105,000 over three years) Lila Wallace-Reader's Digest Writers' 
Awards, Gunn has been reaping the rewards of fame. In late 1992, a British jury 
awarded him the first Forward Prize, which is now England's largest poetry 
prize. In 1993, he won not only the Lenore Marshall-Nation Magazine Prize for 
Poetry for "The Man with Night Sweats" but also a five-year, $369,000 MacArthur 
Fellowship for a lifetime of achievement in poetry. The word "genius," in 
large, boldfaced type, appeared next to his picture in several Bay Area 
newspapers, while the Observer in London headlined its interview with him "A 
poet who's still firing on all cylinders" (a reference, no doubt, to those 
everlasting bikers). The Manhattan-based novelist and critic Susan Sontag, who 
serves on the board of a San Francisco literary organization called City Arts & 
Lectures Inc., lately advised its director to draw on local talent: "You know 
who you should get to speak? Thom Gunn. He's one of the two or three best poets 
writing anywhere in America right now." 
</P>
<P>
 And now, in 1994, the publication of his "Collected Poems" has already 
resulted in that rave review in the TLS, a public reading with U.S. poet 
laureate Rita Dove at Grand Central Station in New York, respectful notices in 
Sunday book sections across the country and -- to Gunn's great delight -- a 
one-page profile in Spin magazine, featuring a photograph that Robert 
Mapplethorpe took of him in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn is particularly pleased by the attention from Spin because he has long 
been an aficionado of rock music and an avid watcher of MTV. "The people at 
Spin thought I was terribly old-fashioned because I read Rolling Stone," he 
reports with typical self-deprecation. But by anyone else's standards, Thom 
Gunn is frighteningly up to date. When he's not rereading Victorian novels or 
discovering Darwin's "Voyage of the Beagle" (the best book he read in 1991, 
Gunn alleges), he's spotting the latest good television show. " 'NYPD Blue,' of 
course, I adore," he says of the most recent season. "It doesn't worry me that 
it's violent any more than that 'King Lear' is violent. I love the way it 
preaches -- it preaches so well." He also watches "Seinfeld" ("like everybody 
else") and "Beavis & Butt-head" ("I really do -- I'm not just pretending") but 
feels that "The Simpsons," which he once admired, has "lost its edge." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn habitually ferrets out the best in every genre, from Philip K. Dick to 
Thomas Hardy, and eagerly recommends a movie like the Harvey Keitel sleaze fest 
"Bad Lieutenant," praising its "hilarious Dostoyevskian humor." He refuses to 
distinguish between a 19th-Century novel and a recent potboiler, between a pop 
song and a classical composition. "I hate the distinction between high art and 
low art, and I have since I was in my teens. Dickens had the audience of Judith 
Krantz in his time -- Trollope held him in rather low esteem because he was too 
crude and too popular," he gleefully points out. 
</P>
<P>
 THE MACARTHUR FELLOWSHIP and all the accompanying hoopla have not much changed 
Thom Gunn's essential existence, though the money will come in handy for 
retirement. "I always said, when people asked how I would support myself in my 
old age, that my public would take care of me. And now it has!" he beams. The 
unexpected windfall also paid for him and his lover, Mike Kitay, to take a 
special trip to Venice, where they hadn't been since they were in their 20s, 
and to Prague, which they saw for the first time and loved. 
</P>
<P>
 Remarking on his good fortune to a British journalist who interviewed him 
after he won the Forward Prize, Thom Gunn said, "I've traveled, I've been 
happily in love for 40 years, and I've read 'The Brothers Karamazov' three 
times." The joke at the end (which is only partly a joke: Gunn takes his 
reading very seriously) undercuts the sentiment a bit, but it is true that he 
has been in love for more than 40 years. He met Mike Kitay, an American 
studying at Cambridge, in 1952. After Kitay returned to America, Gunn went to 
Stanford for graduate work in 1954. The two of them eventually settled in San 
Francisco, where Kitay had a job scriptwriting for television. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not easy to speak of a relationship so long-lasting, so deep and so 
complex, nor of the changes it has gone through, let alone of the effect it has 
had on my writing," Gunn has written about his life with Kitay. "But his was, 
from the start, the example of the searching, worrying, improvising 
intelligence playing upon the emotions, which in turn reflect back on the 
intelligence. It was an example at times as rawly passionate as only Henry 
James can dare to be." (He's not kidding about Henry James. Gunn rereads "The 
Wings of the Dove" every few years, and "The Awkward Age" is one of his two 
favorite novels from the turn of the century; the other is Rudyard Kipling's 
"Kim.") 
</P>
<P>
 A number of Gunn's poems are love poems to Kitay, including "Thoughts on 
Unpacking," "The Separation," "Touch," "The Hug" and a new one, "In Trust." I 
heard "In Trust" for the first time at a poetry reading in March in Berkeley 
(it's too recent even to be in the "Collected Poems") and was extremely moved 
by it -- partly, I imagine, because I was sitting next to Mike Kitay during the 
reading. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike, who still looks very much as he did when Thom described him in "To a 
Friend in Time of Trouble" ("A handsome gray-haired, gray-eyed man, 
tight-knit") had been giving me hints about who or what was being referred to 
in each of the previous poems. When this poem began, he fell silent. 
</P>
<P>
 " You go from me In June for months on end To study equanimity Among high 
trees alone; I go out with a new boyfriend And stay all summer in the city 
where Home mostly on my own I watch the sunflowers flare. " 
</P>
<P>
 But if the poem begins with separation, it ends with a powerful coming 
together: " As you began You'll end the year with me. We'll hug each other 
while we can, Work or stray while we must. Nothing is, or will ever be, Mine, I 
suppose. No one can hold a heart, But what we hold in trust We do hold, even 
apart. " 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn and Kitay's complicated history is reflected in their domestic 
arrangement, which includes other people who have entered their lives along the 
way -- Gunn's family, or "household." And this communal group is in turn 
embedded within the larger community of San Francisco, which Gunn also 
considers his home. Gunn's two "obsessions," as he self-consciously calls them, 
are both connected to this feeling of living within the larger civic society. 
"I don't like people getting movies in their own homes, and I don't like people 
driving around in cars," he announces. "I think people should take public 
transportation and be with other people in movie theaters. Merely sitting near 
another person on a bus or in a movie theater is good for the sense of 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Thom Gunn's household -- where, as he says in one poem, "Each cooks one night, 
and each cooks well" -- consists, at this point, of himself, Mike Kitay, Bob 
Bair, Bill Schuessler and Joseph Batiste. Another roommate, Jim Lay, died of 
AIDS on Christmas Day, 1986. "Four of my friends died in one month," Gunn says 
of the epidemic that stimulated him to write the central poems in "The Man With 
Night Sweats." He himself is HIV-negative, a fortuitously exempted bystander to 
the mass tragedy, as he suggests in the poem "Courtesies of the Interregnum": 
</P>
<P>
 " Excluded from the invitation list To the largest gathering of the decade, 
missed From membership as if the club were full. It is not that I am not 
eligible. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 In the notes at the back of "Collected Poems," Thom Gunn lists the names of 
the dead friends referred to in his poems about AIDS. "For the record -- for my 
record if for no one else's, because they were not famous people -- I wish to 
name them here. . . ." He has always had strong feelings about names, about the 
specific, individual identity assigned to one person and no other. "Poor girl, 
poor girl, what was your name?" he asks in the last line of "The Victim," his 
poem about Sid Vicious' murder of his girlfriend, and in the notes he supplies 
the answer. The actual, historical record, the particulars of an individual 
personality, matter to Gunn, which is one reason his memorial poems have such 
power. 
</P>
<P>
 The same passion for specificity also explains another, very different aspect 
of Thom Gunn's character: his enormous congeniality as a gossip. He remembers 
every tidbit of information ever passed on to him, every remark ever made to 
him, and by whom, and he can retrieve it at exactly the pertinent moment in a 
conversation. "I'm the soul of indiscretion," he confides, and then listens 
eagerly to the next gossipy secret. 
</P>
<P>
 That is one side of Thom Gunn. The other side is just the opposite: a man who 
deeply believes in the virtues of impersonality. In an essay called "My Life up 
to Now," Gunn comments on the fact that he is very consciously "a rather 
derivative poet" and then goes on to say that "it has not been of primary 
interest to develop a unique poetic personality, and I rejoice in Eliot's 
lovely remark that art is the escape from personality." 
</P>
<P>
 The same idea informs his poem "Expression," which complains about "the poetry 
of my juniors," in which "Mother doesn't understand,/and they hate Daddy, the 
noted alcoholic." Tired of this confessional mode (the mode of much 
contemporary American poetry, from Robert Lowell and Sylvia Plath onward), the 
poem's speaker goes to an art museum, where he seeks out a medieval Italian 
painting of the Virgin and Child. The poem ends: 
</P>
<P>
 " The sight quenches, like water after too much birthday cake. Solidly there, 
mother and child stare outward, two pairs of matching eyes void of expression.  
</P>
<P>
 ON THE ASSEMBLAGE-STYLE WALL of Thom Gunn's second-floor study, amid cutout 
pictures of River Phoenix and Keanu Reeves, antique postcards of nude 
bodybuilders and assorted posters, clippings and visual paraphernalia, is a 
photograph that doesn't go with the rest. In it, a beautiful dark-haired woman 
holds a pretty blond baby, both of them staring outward at the camera. I have 
been in the study before, to pick up a book or admire the view out the back 
window, but I have never before noticed the photograph. Now, however, we are 
spending longer than usual here, because Thom Gunn is giving a tour of the 
house to Tony Kushner. (Kushner, in town to give a lecture following the great 
success of "Angels in America," told me that the person he most wanted to meet 
was Thom Gunn, so I arranged a lunch. In Kushner's view, "He is certainly one 
of the greatest poets in the English language. I find his work very scary and 
disturbing and sexy and beautiful.") 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's that?" I say, pointing at the photograph. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my mother," says Thom. "With me, as a baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Thom Gunn was born in 1929 in Gravesend, a town in Kent. His father, the son 
of a Scottish merchant seaman, was a journalist who became quite successful, 
eventually editing a newspaper, the Daily Sketch. Gunn's parents were divorced 
when he was 8 or 9, and he was on fairly distant terms with his father after 
that, but even before the divorce he was closer to his mother. His given name, 
Thomson, was the name of his mother's family, and he identified with that side 
of his heritage. "My mother was one of seven children, all girls," Gunn has 
written, "and all of a very independent turn of mind." One of Thom's childhood 
memories is of his mother "wearing an orchid pinned by a brooch in the shape of 
a hammer and sickle. From this distance the combination sounds like a cliche of 
the '30s, but it wasn't: Other women wouldn't have done something so 
outrageous." He also recalls being lost at the age of about 4 in Kensington 
Gardens (by this time, the family had moved to London), and being asked by a 
policeman to describe his mother. "A proud woman," the little boy answered. 
</P>
<P>
 When Thom was 15, his mother committed suicide; he and his younger brother 
found the body. For most of his writing life, he could not directly address 
this fact. In his one published fragment of autobiography, the tragedy takes 
place between sentences, as it would in an E.M. Forster novel. Then, in 1992, 
Gunn published a poem called "The Gas-Poker," which begins: 
</P>
<P>
 " Forty-eight years ago -- Can it be forty-eight Since then? -- they forced 
the door Which she had barricaded With a full bureau's weight Lest anyone find, 
as they did, What she had blocked it for.  
</P>
<P>
 The two boys who are the poem's "they" -- "Elder and younger brother" -- go 
outside to walk and cry and try to understand what has happened to them. Then: 
</P>
<P>
 Coming back off the grass To the room of her release They who had been her 
treasures Knew to turn off the gas, Take the appropriate measures, Telephone 
the police.  
</P>
<P>
 Borrowing the strategy he used in the poems about LSD, Gunn has relied on 
rhyme and meter to organize an experience that would otherwise be 
incomprehensibly, uncontrollably painful. "Take appropriate measures": It's in 
the very impersonality of the phrase (echoing, as it does, the expressive "who 
had been her treasures") that the sense of personal loss comes through most 
strongly.

 "The surprising thing about one's dead," Thom Gunn said to me many years ago, 
"is that your relationship with them can change over time. Even after they've 
been dead for years, you still find your feelings about them changing, or 
growing. And that makes them seem to alter, too." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask him recently if he still feels that way. "Yes," he says. "Yes. Exactly. 
The longer people are dead, the more your relationship with them changes."

THE SWIMMERS 
</P>

By GREGG SEGAL, Gregg Segal is a contributing photographer to the Los Angeles 
Reader. His work is currently on exhibit at the Los Angeles Municipal Art 
Gallery.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A few months ago, I went to the Helen Levitt retrospective at the Los Angeles 
County Museum of Art. Looking at her photographs from half a century ago of 
families on Manhattan's Upper East Side, I wondered why these pictures still 
resonated. They're not beautifully composed. They're not sensational. In fact, 
they're mundane -- without shouting in your ear or grabbing you by the collar, 
they capture everyday New York life of the '30s and '40s. Most of us, I think, 
are nostalgic for an immediate past, and the unadorned directness of Levitt's 
photographs speaks to that need. 
</P>
<P>
 I am nostalgic for the present, for images of Los Angeles that are both 
grittier and more commonplace than are usually offered. The media tends to 
disparage or sentimentalize L.A.'s public life, reducing all experience to 
horror stories or "human interest" stories. In either case, ordinary citizens 
become so demonized or so idealized that what made them -- and us -- ordinary 
in the first place is lost.  
</P>
<P>
 I took these photographs in June and July, at city pools in Los Feliz and Echo 
Park, because I'm drawn to shared public experiences -- to the rituals of 
everyday life. A great urban institution, the public pool attracts people of 
all backgrounds. (On occasion, they can attract violence; youths at Will Rogers 
Park in Watts attacked six lifeguards this summer.) Public pools quite 
literally strip people of their social uniforms. I also wanted to investigate 
my own back yard; Griffith Park Pool is down the street, and Echo Park Indoor 
Pool is just five minutes by car.  
</P>
<P>
 The Echo Park pool also happens to have fantastic light, which comes raking 
through skylights onto cement bleachers that overlook the shallow end of the 
pool. I turned the bleachers into my studio, where I could convey the few quiet 
moments of pool life: kids sunning themselves, being shushed by their parents, 
drying off. But I knew that if I was going to capture the kids' abandon, I 
would have to get into the water. 
</P>
<P>
 As I descended into the Griffith Park Pool with an underwater camera, I felt 
bulky, the orange flash protruding like a periscope. Documentary photographers, 
the old saw goes, should be unobtrusive. But there's no way to do that when 
you've got a contraption this cool and dozens of thrashing kids who want their 
picture taken. They bobbed up and down and waved at the camera as if on TV. 
"Just be natural," I shouted stupidly. They rushed forward and splashed me as I 
hit the shutter. "How many of you've peed in the pool this afternoon?" I 
yelled. "Me," they answered in unison. This is good. This is what it's like 
being in the public pool on a 100-degree Sunday.

VOICES: AN ARTIST SETTLES INTO A LIFELONG PATTERN; MOMO NAGANO WAS ATTRACTED 
EARLY TO THE NAVAJO ART FORM OF WEAVING. EVENTUALLY, IT HELPED HER APPRECIATE 
HER OWN ETHNIC HERITAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MOMO NAGANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Momo Nagano, 68, of Silver Lake, a second-generation Japanese American, grew 
up near Jefferson Boulevard and Western Avenue. As part of the wave of 
anti-Japanese sentiment during World War II, Nagano and her family were sent to 
the Manzanar internment camp in the Owens Valley in 1942. After finishing high 
school at the camp, she was allowed to leave and attend Wheaton College in 
Massachusetts, where she earned a bachelor's degree in history. Nagano 
eventually returned to Los Angeles, married, raised a family of four as a 
single parent and embarked upon a career as a weaver. For more than a decade, 
Nagano also has worked in the gallery at the Japanese American Cultural and 
Community Center in Little Tokyo. Though she says her job has yet to influence 
her weaving style, the experience has increased her appreciation for her own 
ethnic culture and made her see the need to keep alive its traditional art 
forms. Nagano was interviewed by Tommy Li.  
</P>
<P>
 I was 16 years old when my family was sent to Manzanar. The first few months, 
for those of us who had no jobs, there was not a lot to do, so when the U.S. 
government decided to set up a camouflage net factory in camp, I immediately 
signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the project did not last long, I found that I loved the process of 
weaving burlap strips through the netting. Ironically, that may have influenced 
me to go into weaving seriously over 20 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 After finishing college, I studied ceramics at a local art school in Los 
Angeles and became a potter in the '60s. I moved on to weaving after reading a 
library book on Navajo weaving. I took a weaving course to learn the basics and 
would go home from class each week to weave hangings with bright colors and 
every new technique I had learned. 
</P>
<P>
 I don't think my weaving looks particularly Japanese, because I make up the 
abstract designs as I weave. I've studied other techniques like African 
weaving, South American weaving, but I had little exposure to Japanese weaving. 
</P>
<P>
 I fell into this job at the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center 
accidentally. The gallery secretary asked me if I would take her job 
temporarily because she was going to have a baby. She never returned from her 
maternity leave, and my temporary part-time job became a permanent full-time 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 The job has always been interesting and quite educational for me, learning 
about the tea ceremony, flower-arranging, Okinawan stencil-dyeing, netsuke 
(miniature sculpture) and so on.  
</P>
<P>
 I didn't know that there were all the different schools with many different 
ways to do the flower arranging or the different approaches to the tea ceremony 
ritual. 
</P>
<P>
 I've learned about contemporary art and graphic design and photography in 
Japan and in the Japanese American community. The more you learn about 
something, the more you can appreciate it. 
</P>
<P>
 When I was young, I wanted to join the Girl Scouts and go camping, but my 
mother wanted me to be more ladylike and tried to encourage me to study the 
Japanese tea ceremony or flower arranging instead, a suggestion I totally 
rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents didn't mind that there was a rejection. With the first-generation 
Japanese, they wanted the second generation to really appreciate all these 
cultural arts. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, they were quite concerned that their children become 
Americanized, to fit into the American culture successfully. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of their precautions, we still did things in our family like 
celebrate Japanese Boy's Day, where large cloth carp were flown for sons, and 
Japanese Girl's Day, where doll sets were displayed for daughters, and the 
traditional New Year's feasting. In that way you're absorbing Japanese culture 
without realizing it. So a few aspects of our culture were being passed on. 
</P>
<P>
 People as they mature get interested in their culture, and then that will keep 
some of the traditional arts going. There's no way you can force it. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center becomes a 
valuable resource, especially for children of third-generation Japanese 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 The center offers special workshops during the summer for children ages 4 to 
12. For four days, they are immersed in aspects of their culture that don't 
come up in their own homes. Center staff take them on a tour of Little Tokyo, 
to one of the Buddhist temples and to the Japanese American National Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The children learn that many art forms are really beautiful in themselves. 
Traditional Japanese arts bring self-discipline, serenity and peace of mind to 
people who practice them. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time at the center, I did a basic weaving workshop for the kids, 
ages 7 to 8. 
</P>
<P>
 I tried to relate it to the Japanese culture. I was going to have them weave 
the moon shape and talk about the traditional moon viewing, in which the 
Japanese gather during the summer in a garden to admire the moon and write 
poetry about it. 
</P>
<P>
 But they were a bit too energetic and too young to get the cultural lesson 
across, though they enjoyed the basic weaving. Only two of them managed to 
complete the moon shape. 
</P>
<P>
 If sessions were longer and I had more time to spend with each child, I 
wouldn't mind doing it again next summer.

VOICES: PRESERVATION ACTS: KEEPING TRADITIONS ALIVE IN CHINATOWN; DON TOY NEVER 
LOST TRACK OF HIS RICH HERITAGE. HE'S TAKING STEPS TO SEE THAT OTHERS DON'T, 
EITHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By DON TOY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don Toy grew up in Chinatown and became one of the founders of Teen Post at 
600 N. Broadway. At the community youth center, Toy encourages teen-agers to 
explore their heritage through lessons on Chinese and Asian traditional arts, 
including calligraphy, watercolor painting and lion dancing. As chairman of the 
Chinese Cultural and Community Center of Greater Los Angeles, he has been 
working to create a center for the arts similar to one in Little Tokyo. He was 
interviewed by Tommy Li.  
</P>
<P>
 When I was growing up, I always had a rebellious personality. I al ways felt 
that we should question and try to understand things better. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference with me was that I never knew how to be ashamed of my 
first-generation Chinese parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of my friends were. They would walk in front of or behind their parents, 
so it made it look like you weren't with them. 
</P>
<P>
 But for me, what changed me the most was when I started doing some of the 
things that people did in America, which were foreign to my father. 
</P>
<P>
 When I hugged my father the first time, he didn't know what to do. And that's 
because in the Chinese culture, we didn't show affection that way. 
</P>
<P>
 So things like that would get me to think, well, wait a minute, why did he 
react that way, and why isn't it that we're able to show affection the way that 
Anglo Americans do? 
</P>
<P>
 I started to analyze and I wanted to integrate the Chinese culture into 
American society. I felt that we have such a rich Chinese culture, that without 
understanding it we lose a lot. I would be less of a person than I could be. 
</P>
<P>
 That's one of the big reasons why I think we need to continue educating new 
immigrant and third- and fourth-generation Chinese about our culture and its 
influence in the traditional arts. 
</P>
<P>
 What are we doing now at Teen Post to make sure that these things don't go 
away? We have classes like lion dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 Lion dancing is known as a festive activity, especially to celebrate Chinese 
New Year. 
</P>
<P>
 When you teach it, it's not just coming out and doing the lion dancing. It's 
also understanding the philosophy: the code of chivalry, the code of honor, the 
code of honesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the physical part of dancing -- playing the drums, the cymbal -- that's 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the other part of understanding what does it mean to be chivalrous, 
what does it mean to be loyal, what does it mean to be able to help your fellow 
beings. That's the part that's interwoven and that I feel is important. 
</P>
<P>
 The lion dancing itself is also nice for kids. They like the costume, they 
like the noise. It teaches kids discipline, it teaches them good work habits, 
it teaches them teamwork because the drums, the music have to go with the 
person that's actually doing the lion dance. 
</P>
<P>
 At Teen Post, I also have senior citizens teach traditional musical forms of 
the Chinese violin, which has only two strings, the Chinese guitar and Chinese 
opera. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a story behind each art form, and when you have an opportunity to let 
people understand what it is, then the interest is there. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, I've been talking to some of our senior citizens about the history of 
handmade juong -- Chinese tamales made of sweet rice, sausage, pork, sour egg 
yolk and nuts, wrapped in bamboo leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 It goes back to a folk tale about a Chinese scholar. He was very honest and 
was caring for the people and did a lot of things for the king. The story has 
it that because he fell into disfavor with the king, the king had him executed 
and thrown into a river. 
</P>
<P>
 But the people loved him so much and felt so bad about it that they made the 
juongs and wrapped them up into bamboo leaves and tied them up. The villagers 
then threw them into the river so the fishes and animals would eat them and not 
eat his body. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought that was a great story. But my question is: What's going to happen 
when all these little old ladies and people who make them die off? Nobody is 
going to know how to make juong . 
</P>
<P>
 So we want to document it by doing some videos. When they make the juongs , I 
want people to line up so we can actually videotape and know how to do every 
step. 
</P>
<P>
 One final way we can preserve traditional arts is by having a Chinese cultural 
and community center, which has been in the planning stages for at least two 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 What we're talking about is a seven- to nine-story building with a Chinese 
garden on top, a space for a bookstore to sell books and a theater. We're also 
looking at having arts-instruction classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 There's $1.6 million that's been approved by the Community Redevelopment 
Agency for land acquisition and an additional $250,000 is available for 
programs, on-site improvement and temporary facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But what's holding us back is that we're still trying to finalize negotiations 
for a site at the 40,000-square-foot Hip Hing lot at the 800 block of North 
Hill Street.  
</P>
<P>
 We need the offices of the mayor and the City Council and other elected 
officials who represent the Chinatown area to be sensitive to the importance of 
having a project like the community center. 
</P>
<P>
 It can give people a sense of pride, a sense of community, a sense of 
identity.

 Thank you for your captivating and enlightening cover story "Culture Clash" 
(July 10) in which you so accurately summarize the cultural gulf that seems to 
be the inscrutable enigma between African Americans and Africans: "African 
Americans and African immigrants seek a path to common ground, but 
misconceptions and stereotypes clutter the way."

FILM COMMENT; WISE WORDS FROM MOUTHS OF BABES; CHILDLIKE INNOCENCE IS IN, 
PARENTAL ROLE-MODELING IS OUT IN THE SUMMER CROP OF KIDPICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, Peter Rainer is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's Age of Innocence time at the movies. In film after film this summer we've 
been put through the same toddling paces. Forget the swank spies and 
overmuscled clobberers. We're being asked to crown a new movie hero: The 
pure-in-heart man-child Forrest Gump and all the purer-than-thou pre-teens and 
tots from kidpics like "Angels in the Outfield," "North," "Getting Even With 
Dad" and "Little Big League." 
</P>
<P>
 What do these films have in common -- aside from high glucose tolerance? The 
children (or child-men) in them all come from broken or dysfunctional homes, 
mostly without fathers. They're wiser than their parents, wiser than adult 
society. Their wisdom serves one cause only: To re-create a family for 
themselves. Errant fathers -- the goblins of this genre -- must be brought back 
into the fold or else replaced with a kindlier model. 
</P>
<P>
 We're accustomed to thinking of child-themed films in Victorian terms -- as 
demonstrations that children can be rescued from their truancy. These new films 
reverse the terms. They're all about how the family can be rescued -- by 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the Romantic era is more appropriate to what's going on here than 
the Victorian. That era's idealization of the child was all-of-a-piece with its 
idealization of man in his basic state -- childlike, at home among the bushes 
and the berries, untrammeled by the false refinements of city life. Infants and 
idiots were regarded as closest to nature; in their primitiveness was a purity 
that could be exalted above mere intellect. (Animals were considered 
primitive-pure too, which is perhaps why we're also seeing films about collies, 
seals and stallions.) 
</P>
<P>
 Forrest Gump -- even the name has a vegetative, close-to-the-earth sound to it 
-- has an IQ of 70 but he's supernally decent. Raised without a father by his 
aphorism-spouting mother, he passes through the key Boomer decades -- the '50s 
through the early '80s -- without registering the wrenches in public life. 
Vietnam, assassinations, Watergate -- none of these sway him. (It's our fantasy 
of how we would like to have survived those years.) Forrest wants only the love 
of his lifelong, father-abused friend Jenny: He wants a family. We're supposed 
to applaud the bumpkinish divinity of his quest. 
</P>
<P>
 We're made to understand that it takes a child -- a child-man -- to explain to 
us what really matters in life. In an age of experts, Forrest is the wise man 
as simpleton, the straight arrow as holy fool. His innocence is like a balm for 
the turmoil of the past four decades. The film wants to turn us all into Gumps 
-- it wants us to jog right alongside him as he sprints across America the 
Beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Forrest's innocence exists in separation from the big bad world, 
the filmmakers aren't quite as naive as their hero. They score reactionary 
points repeatedly as Forrest moves through the decades: None of that 
hippie-dippy, war-protesting, free-loving, drug-chugging stuff for him. (The 
film never makes a case for what corruptions the counterculture might have been 
reacting against .) 
</P>
<P>
 All these ills are what he must rescue Jenny from -- he must bring her back to 
herself, to their childhood roots in Greenbow, Ala. The real idiots in "Forrest 
Gump" are the counterculture clowns and assassinating crazies who never had any 
innocence to lose. It's time to mend what they tore apart. Forrest is our 
Puritan knight errant for traditional values: Essentially sexless, he stands up 
for family, true love, small-town life, mothers, serving your country, winning 
the American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect to see Forrest Gump campaign stickers in the upcoming elections -- for 
both parties. For it's the measure of the film's across-the-board success that 
it camouflages its politics as a kind of fuzzy nostalgic populism. It's flower 
power '90s style: Romanticism with a conservative core. 
</P>
<P>
 If "Forrest Gump" is a balm for lobotomized Boomers, the welter of kidpics 
this summer resembles a load of Boomer guilt. These films are the next stage in 
the recent male weepie cycle where hard-pressed yuppie dads finally reconnect 
with their families by locating the child within. In those films, ranging from 
"Regarding Henry" to "Hook," children were essentially employed as peewee 
spirit guides; they were accessories to the adults' quest for goodness. In this 
summer's crop, it's the kids and not their parents who are center stage. Of 
course, the kids are all boys. Girls are eerily absent from these family sagas. 
Is this because girls still are not regarded as Leaders of Tomorrow? That's the 
downside of the traditional-values ploy: It delivers traditional prejudices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The male weepie cycle was a reaction to the recession. It was a touchy-feely 
response to a time when overachievers became under-earners. With the recession 
receding, the new family film is less about parents coping with downsized 
expectations -- they've learned to cope -- and more about pint-sized sages 
bringing their errant parents back into the fold. 
</P>
<P>
 In "North," for example, the boy's parents are such nattering, whiny 
careerists that he sues to find a new, caring pair. His trek takes him through 
a sitcom array of moms and dads from Texas to Hawaii to Ward Cleaverish 
suburbia before his real parents inexplicably defrost and celebrate their 
wonder boy. Like so many of the films in this cycle, "North" seems to be an 
expression of hurt and regret that all families aren't as peachy-keen as the 
ones in sitcoms. It's a sadness particular to Boomers.  
</P>
<P>
 Little boy North at least has parents he can rehabilitate. In most of the 
other films, the boys -- a bland, virtuous lot -- have to haul their fathers 
back onto the scene or else find new ones. In "Angels in the Outfield," Roger 
the motherless angel-gazer rises above his uncaring biker dad and fetches 
himself a better one, the manager of the Angels, whose team his visions bring 
to glory. Roger teaches his new adoptive dad to believe in the miracle of love 
all over again. (Tellingly, the star of the original 1951 "Angels in the 
Outfield" was a girl, but don't despair. When Roger says his prayers at night 
he follows "Amen" with "A-Woman." This kid is more PC than God!)  
</P>
<P>
 In "Little Big League," 12-year-old fatherless Billy Heywood inherits 
ownership of the last-place Minnesota Twins, becomes its manager and teaches 
the ballplayers to love the game all over again. Even though love and not 
winning is the message here, the team -- natch -- wins the pennant. In the 
current Hollywood, if you're good you're a winner. (Forrest Gump became a war 
hero and millionaire.) Billy even has final say on who his new dad will be -- 
he turns out to be his best big buddy and the Twins' captain. (Is there a 
preponderance of baseball-oriented kids films because baseball is perceived as 
being a game between fathers and sons?) 
</P>
<P>
 Even Macaulay Culkin is in the wisdom-dispensing business these days. (If 
there's a "Home Alone 3" he'll probably put his parents into therapy.) In 
"Getting Even With Dad," Culkin's Timmy, motherless, is dumped by his aunt at 
the doorstep of his petty thief deadbeat father. Timmy hordes the cache from 
his father's recent heist and, in exchange for its return, blackmails Dad into 
showing him a fatherly good time at the ballpark, the aquarium, the museum. Dad 
comes around: He learns to love again. He even chooses his boy over his loot -- 
a throwback to male-weepie-style sacrifice. And Timmy engineers a romance 
between Dad and the undercover cop who is trailing him. He'll be getting a new 
mom of his own choosing. 
</P>
<P>
 C hildren in society, as opposed to children in the movies, are currently 
afflicted with bad PR. On the talk shows, on magazine covers and Op-Ed pages, 
we're confronted with the phenomenon of the child as abused tyrant, prey to 
drugs, gangs, crime. Our idealized notions of childhood innocence don't jibe 
with the gang-banging Uzi-toters in the news. For those who can't see the 
Forrest Gump for the trees, this phenomenon can best be blamed on the breakup 
of the family, on welfare, on those pesky two-career households. In a 
particularly woozy moment you may even go so far as to blame it all on "Murphy 
Brown," on Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The current crop of kidpics resembles nothing so much as Hollywood's craven 
response to its own (supposed) culpability. They certainly don't look like 
movies that spring from any genuine childhood feeling; for one thing, the kids 
in them are all too goody-goody and role-modelly. (And, in fact, most of these 
movies have been flops with kids.) They elevate children at the expense of 
parents -- fathers, mostly. It's a kind of penance on the part of adult 
filmmakers for past sins. Single motherhood, as opposed to absent fatherhood, 
is spared -- that's a political hot potato. And notice that the settings are 
mostly white and middle-class, which helps eliminate poverty and racism from 
the family-misery equation. 
</P>
<P>
 The kids have a sense of entitlement. No children of rage here. (How 
appropriate that "The Little Rascals" should be made into a movie now, with its 
rainbow coalition of benign tots carousing in an L.A. paradise.) Uncynical, 
steely with self-esteem, they instruct their parents in how to love them in the 
way a family counselor might. The parents, or parent-figures, are rewarded in 
increments for the good they do their boys. 
</P>
<P>
 The innocence game isn't only being played for penance. There's also a pushy 
self-righteousness about these kidpics. The filmmakers are angling for merit 
badges in the moral crusade. Since no one in Hollywood is making 
children-oriented movies with any bite or realism, the way is open for 
message-mongering schlockmeisters to muck about in fantasyland. 
</P>
<P>
 But this business of turning kids into wise adults and adults into wayward 
kids only works when it's done with some snap -- some naughtiness -- instead of 
all this moral overload. If there's a road back to innocence, these films 
haven't found it.*

FILM CLIPS / NATURAL BORN COLLEAGUES: TRENT REZNOR'S KILLER SOUNDTRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Steve Hochman 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're a star-crossed couple, two misfit provocateurs brought together by 
fate, on a mission of mayhem to shock the system with images of extreme 
brutality. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey and Mallory, the merciless titular figures of "Natural Born Killers"? 
</P>
<P>
 Or Oliver Stone, the film's director, and industrial-rock star Trent Reznor, 
who helped shape the movie's ambitious musical track and album? 
</P>
<P>
 The latter, like the former, was a match made in, well, wherever. 
</P>
<P>
 Reznor tapped right into Stone's graphic realization of Quentin Tarantino's 
violent story. Catching his ear was the way Stone used music as an aural 
representation of the movie's synaptic-overload theme: Dozens of songs were 
used, sometimes two or three layered on top of each other, for a unique, 
disturbing soundscape. 
</P>
<P>
 For Reznor, who aims for the same effect with his band, Nine Inch Nails, it 
was a natural fit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movie's about isolation -- not a giant stretch for me," says Reznor, who 
in leading Nine Inch Nails has used some particularly disturbing images in his 
own songs and video, including one way-too-rough-for-MTV clip depicting a man 
submitting himself to unspeakable debasements, mutilations and ultimately 
becoming, literally, ground meat. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking about the film, Reznor could easily be describing his own work: "The 
main characters of this film are basically pieces that don't fit into the right 
holes and they have a strong love for each other in a world that's rejected 
them. And they kill people. It all makes sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Was it Reznor's artistic fascination with violence that attracted Stone? 
</P>
<P>
 "Draw your own conclusions on that," the director says, calling in from 
vacation in Indonesia. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that Stone also enlisted the services of Dr. Dre -- the rap star known 
for artistic and real-life fascination with violence -- for the soundtrack, the 
conclusion more or less draws itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I admire both artists very much," Stone says. "They're young and obviously 
troubled people and their lyrics and music reflect that. So is Eddie Vedder and 
so was Kurt Cobain. There's something going on in our world, you know that. 
It's a violent society, violent system, and corrupt -- the system, the media, 
the government." 
</P>
<P>
 And there were plenty of appropriate songs for Stone to choose from when 
assembling music for the film. Producers Jane Hampshire and Don Murphy sent 
dozens of tapes to Stone while he was scouting locations. Budd Carr, the film's 
music supervisor, also brought in ideas, and such figures as Peter Gabriel were 
also consulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Stone first approached Reznor just to see about using one of his songs in the 
film. But when Reznor saw the movie in a private screening and heard the way 
the music was employed, he had a brainstorm about a possible soundtrack album:  
</P>
<P>
 "I said to Oliver, 'I think it would be cool if you could take the songs and 
edit them and edit them and layer them and incorporate dialogue and make more 
of a keepsake of the film, something unique instead of just 10 songs from the 
movie like usual.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So Reznor took editing and mixing equipment with him on the road during NIN's 
spring tour, Carr got on the phone to get clearances from artists whose work 
Reznor was tinkering with and soon the album was ready: collages, remixes and 
medleys constructed from 27 of the film's songs and some of its dialogue, plus 
new songs by Nine Inch Nails and by the Dr. Dre-produced Dogg Pound.  
</P>
<P>
 Says Carr, "Trent took a lot from our film editors and music editors. They did 
a great deal of music layering for Oliver, songs playing simultaneously and 
against each other, creating cacophony and energy." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this effort -- due to be released the week of Aug. 21 -- the start of a 
beautiful friendship? 
</P>
<P>
 Both Stone and Reznor say they'd love to work with the other again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll do his life story," the director jokes.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has a lot of that (Jim) Morrison thing going on," says Stone of Reznor. 
"Very romantic, a balladeer . . . no, poet is the right word."

FILM CLIPS / DOCUFIGHT: 'CHICKEN HAWK': THE CONTROVERSY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By John Anderson 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a documentary, it's got a little of everything: sexual aberration and 
family values, radical sodomites and rabid reactionaries, ancient Greece and 
Allen Ginsberg. And when it was shown last March at the New York Underground 
Film Festival, Adi Sideman's "Chicken Hawk: Men Who Love Boys" -- a 55-minute 
documentary about the North American Man-Boy Love Assn. -- started the feathers 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in Boston in 1978 and currently claiming 1,500 members, NAMBLA 
celebrates sexual liaisons between adult men and underage boys. Not 
surprisingly, its existence has provoked every response but ambiguity: 
Conservative groups loathe the NAMBLA-ites; most gay groups despise them 
because their predilection feeds into the oldest homophobic stereotype about 
gays in general -- that they are, by nature, child molesters; and even those 
who would ordinarily defend the civil liberties involved are put off by NAMBLA. 
The group holds meetings, operates a hot line and publishes a newsletter, all 
in the face of a dearth of public support. 
</P>
<P>
 So it might be surprising that a film would give such a group a platform, 
allowing them to air their positions while showing them being threatened, 
reviled and going about NAMBLA business. 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the protest marches, angry press conferences and widespread fury 
about NAMBLA -- something that is certain to follow the movie to Los Angeles 
when it opens Friday at the Los Feliz -- director Sideman sat in a sea of 
relative calm. Because, with the exception of his NYU film school professor -- 
who questioned whether the film was socially responsible, and then gave him an 
A on the project anyway -- no one on either side of the issue has had a bad 
word to say about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pro-'Chicken Hawk' and anti-NAMBLA," said Tom McDonough, 47, founder of 
the conservative, anti-homosexual organization Straight Kids USA, whose 
virulent opposition to NAMBLA is a major component of Sideman's film. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm glad they're getting their 15 minutes of fame," he said. "I'm glad 
they're getting this exposure, because they're an organization that's out to do 
harm -- dropping the age of consent laws is what they really want to do -- and 
a lot of the members are involved in child pornography. They only did this 
movie if they were allowed tell their side of the story, and it really makes 
them look evil." 
</P>
<P>
 Chimes in Don Rosenberg, 46, of the New York-based National Traditionalist 
Caucus, "We thought the movie was very fair. I think Adi did a very good job of 
letting Leyland Stevenson (the film's central character) and his cohorts hang 
themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson, 55, a spokesman for NAMBLA, was the focus of much criticism when 
the film opened in New York July 6 as perhaps the most riveting example of 
NAMBLA-ism. Shown in the film smiling beatifically as he discusses his sexual 
preference for young boys, or trying to wheedle his way into a boy's confidence 
at a small-town strip mall, Stevenson comes across as a man who savors his 
sexual encounters with unbridled joy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a positive movie," said Stevenson, who has been arrested for possession 
of child pornography and describes himself as an investor. "It presents 
flesh-and-blood human beings, as distinguished from stereotypes. It does not 
attempt to represent man-boy relationships with some absurd preconception that 
all such relationships are wrong or bad. It simply shows a few people who 
happen to be members of NAMBLA, and happen to be interested in boys, as what 
they are: People who have a system of values, a set of ethics and a set of 
priorities about what's worth doing in life, on their own terms." 
</P>
<P>
 For Sideman, 23, who came to the United States from his native Israel, 
discovering the existence of NAMBLA was only slightly more surprising than has 
been the reaction to his film. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Straight Kids people are happy with it because they think it shows the 
kind of atrocities NAMBLA is about, how evil they really are," Sideman said. 
"And NAMBLA loves the film, because its members think it shows how humane they 
are. It's something I never expected. But both extremes have found a way to use 
it for their own political reasons." 
</P>
<P>
 That there is such unanimity of opinion between warring factions is testimony 
to "Chicken Hawk's" coldly objective point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had a script, or an agenda," said the director, now an NYU senior. "I 
didn't set out saying, 'I'm going to crucify these people.' I knew that were 
going to do it to themselves." He laughs.  
</P>
<P>
 "What are we supposed to do?" he asks, of those who, like his professor, would 
call "Chicken Hawk" an apology for NAMBLA. "Should we shove it all under the 
carpet? If we simply say, 'These people are monsters,' and don't discuss it, 
they may very well just act like monsters." 
</P>
<P>
 McDonough's pursuit of -- some might say obsession with -- NAMBLA helped break 
a March, 1993, WNBC-TV story revealing that member Peter Melzer, who is seen in 
the film, was teaching at the Bronx High School of Science. He has so far 
focused almost exclusively on the organization, but sees its existence as 
symptomatic of larger issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is help stem the tide of gay propaganda that's been 
going on in America," said McDonough, who calls his Straight Kids USA a "sexual 
identity support group." "Homosexuals have hundreds of support groups to make 
them feel comfortable about being a homosexual. Now, if you feel comfortable 
about something, there's no need to change. So these groups are actually 
helping to keep them homosexual. We want to make straight kids feel comfortable 
about being hetero sexual." 
</P>
<P>
 "What a lot of nonsense," responds Stevenson. "As if the vast 90-plus percent 
of society was not already promoting that particular lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Stevenson and McDonough never meet on film; McDonough and members of the 
National Traditionalist Caucus are seen demonstrating outside the home of 
Renato Corazzo, the voice of the NAMBLA hot line (whose recorded message urging 
callers to "be safe, be brave, be proud to be a boy lover" been been played 
repeatedly on the Howard Stern radio show). NAMBLA members are seen being 
castigated by civil-rights groups at the gay march on Washington. A father is 
heard saying of Leyland Stevenson, "If he came near my kid, I'd kill him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ginsberg, who is seen briefly, issued a statement following the release of the 
film, saying that he'd joined the group in the mid-'80s as a "matter of civil 
rights and free speech," and as a response to the "self-righteousness" of the 
news media's judgment of the group. "To my knowledge, he hasn't seen the film," 
said Ginsberg associate Bob Rosenthal. "Allen is not a pedophile. I have many 
times trusted Allen in the company of my sons. His NAMBLA membership was purely 
about civil liberties." 
</P>
<P>
 While some may want to distance themselves from the group, or the movie, 
Stevenson -- whose frankness about his sexual preferences earns grudging 
respect even from McDonough -- holds firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I have any particular courage," he said, "it is simply to acknowledge that 
truth has a much higher value than the approval that other people may or may 
not give one at a certain point. If it's necessary to be politically incorrect 
-- and in this society it seem absolutely essential if one is even going to 
approach truth -- then I'm going to be as radically politically incorrect as 
necessary to further that objective."

FILM CLIPS / SUNDANCE UPDATE: WHATEVER HAPPENED TO FEST FAVES? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Natale 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Come August, anyone who'd been caught up in the excitement of January's 
Sundance Film Festival begins to wonder, "What happened to all those promising 
movies?" 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since Steven Soderbergh's surprise hit, "sex, lies and videotape," made 
its debut at the Park City, Utah, festival in 1989, Sundance has become the 
place for Hollywood to find young talent. For the two weeks of the festival, 
struggling directors and writers can bask in comparisons to Soderbergh, Quentin 
Tarantino ("Reservoir Dogs") or Richard Linklater ("Slacker") as agents sniff 
around them like eager bloodhounds. 
</P>
<P>
 And then suddenly the party's over and reality sets in. Months go by, and the 
films are temporarily forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the more widely discussed debuts at this year's festival, only in the past 
month or so have a few of these works by first- or second-time filmmakers been 
released, including Rose Troche's lesbian romantic comedy "Go Fish"; David O. 
Russell's "Spanking the Monkey," the tale of one young man's worst summer 
vacation, and the out-of-competition "Mi Vida Loca," a saga of Echo Park 
Latinas directed by Allison Anders. 
</P>
<P>
 But where are the other standout items: Tom Noonan's Grand Jury Prize winner 
"What Happened Was . . . ," the ultimate date-night drama; the two Filmmakers' 
Trophy winners, "Clerks," Kevin Smith's comedy about employees in a convenience 
store, and Boaz Yakin's inner-city thriller "Fresh," and the acclaimed 
documentaries "Hoop Dreams," about two teens with basketball fever, and "Martha 
and Ethel," a tale of two nannies? 
</P>
<P>
 Most are actually due this fall and winter. The long lag time between festival 
and release, says Liz Manne, senior vice president of marketing at Fine Line 
Pictures, distributors of "Spanking the Monkey" and "Hoop Dreams," is due to 
the big difference between the warm collegiality of a film festival and the 
cold realities of the marketplace. With each of these releases, it's a matter 
of "doing the work to take the excitement and hype of the festival-goers and 
extend it to the population as a whole," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 This requires a great deal of intensive labor and often, cosmetic surgery, 
which can take four to six months at least -- including everything from blowing 
up the film to 35-millimeter, to slapping on a new soundtrack, and even 
editing. Then the film has to be screened for its target audience, a marketing 
campaign must be developed and just the right release date selected. 
</P>
<P>
 How is all this accomplished without losing the head of steam the film picked 
up at Sundance? Deftly, say independent film distributors. One misstep and the 
film can disappear without a trace and a potentially promising career can be 
pushed back to square one. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviews help. But "artistic integrity doesn't always translate into 
commerciality," says Goldwyn's vice president of distribution, Eamonn Bowles, 
who plans to roll out "What Happened Was . . ." very slowly this fall, when it 
goes head-to-head with sophisticated fare from the major studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Fall is popular because by the time all the work is done preparing these 
Sundance films, it's too late for a spring release. During summer, independent 
film companies release films at their own risk; the blockbuster season should 
be the worst time to launch a specialized low-budget film. Yet that's exactly 
when Bowles reasoned that Goldwyn should go with "Go Fish," hooking its release 
onto the celebrations surrounding June's 25th anniversary of the Stonewall 
riots, a gay liberation cornerstone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stonewall helped put the film on the map," says Bowles. And the payoff on the 
$100,000-budgeted comedy has been $2 million to date. 
</P>
<P>
 Summer has also proved a charm for "Spanking the Monkey," says Manne, as 
counterprogramming against the studio blockbusters. The youth-oriented comedy 
has done well in limited release, with reviews even stronger than those from 
Sundance. 
</P>
<P>
 Which is another reason to give some breathing room between the festival and a 
film's release. At Sundance critics sometimes overdose on films; a bit of 
distance and subsequent festival exposure at Cannes, Toronto and New York can 
give a clearer picture of a film's relative strengths and weaknesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramax is launching the fall with "Fresh," a clear-eyed look at a tough 
inner-city New York kid, on Aug. 31. After a summer of action and comedy, 
"audiences are starved for this kind of film," says David Dinerstein, vice 
president of marketing at Miramax. 
</P>
<P>
 Miramax is also planning on "Clerks," Smith's $27,000 first feature, for this 
fall, but much polishing -- and a much-publicized appeal for its NC-17 rating 
-- still lies ahead. Between now and its Oct. 21 release date, when the film's 
core college audience will be settled in school, Miramax will screen "Clerks" 
outside on a screen at this weekend's Woodstock reunion -- a captive audience 
if there ever was one -- and at university and college towns around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 The preparation for Fine Line's "Hoop Dreams" will be trickier. Though it won 
the Sundance audience documentary prize, nonfiction films are always a tough 
sell. As with "Spanking," says Manne, picking the right release date for Steve 
James' seven-years-in-the-making film is crucial. Fine Line will launch "Hoop 
Dreams" roughly at the start of the NBA basketball season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jyll Johnstone's "Martha and Ethel" is a documentary with a less-obvious hook. 
The history of two nannies is a definite adult, art-house subject like "What 
Happened Was. . . ." In fact, by the time "Martha and Ethel" finally opens 
early next year, the 17th annual Sundance Film Festival will be in progress. 
And the distributors will have to start all over again.*

BAILEY SCORES POINTS WITH TEAMMATES; BASKETBALL: INCOMING FRESHMAN AT UCLA, 
PLAYING AGAINST AND ALONGSIDE CURRENT BRUINS, HELPS LEAD SQUAD TO THE SAY NO 
CLASSIC CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Toby Bailey got a taste of playing with -- and against -- his future UCLA 
basketball teammates in the Say No Classic championship game Sunday at Trade 
Tech. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey, the former Loyola High standout, teamed with incoming UCLA freshman 
J.R. Henderson and sophomore Cameron Dollar on the Blue Chip team in a 96-93 
victory over Team Pasadena ATFB, a squad that featured the Bruins' All 
Pacific-10 conference senior forward Ed O'Bannon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like a scrimmage game with the guys I'm going to be playing with 
all the time at UCLA," said Bailey. "It will help the chemistry on our team 
when the first day of practice rolls, especially for the new guys coming in." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins trio worked well together Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dollar, a 6-foot-1 guard who was named the classic's most valuable player, and 
Henderson, a 6-8 forward from Bakersfield East High, scored 17 points each 
while Bailey added 16. Bailey also had 24 points in a 101-88 semifinal victory 
against top-seeded Big Time. 
</P>
<P>
 In the championship, Blue Chip (4-4) held a 67-50 lead in the third quarter 
before Team Pasadena (6-2) climbed to within 93-90 with 16 seconds remaining. 
O'Bannon, who at times was guarded by the 6-5 Bailey, poured in 31 points for 
the Pasadena squad.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every time Ed started doing something great, I just kept trying to remember, 
'He's on my team during the season,' so I didn't have anything to worry about. 
I couldn't get mad." Bailey said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Say No Classic, which concluded its 17th year, not only offers the players 
an opportunity to hone their skills, but girls' coaches such as Washington 
High's Julie Rousseau and Fremont's Mat Taylor too. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you do anything more and more, practice makes perfect," said 
Rousseau, who is entering her third season at Washington. "This is my off 
season and my time. I use it to sharpen my tools and skills for the upcoming 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Rousseau, 29, helped the Generals rebound from a 10-15 finish in 
the 1992-93 season to win a share of the Southern Pacific Conference title and 
advance to the City Section 4-A Division semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 She coached a team into the women's final of the Say No Classic for the third 
consecutive year. Her team, Rated PG, included Kyetra Brown of Jefferson and 
former Washington player April Adams, now at College of the Sequoia. Rated PG 
lost Sunday to Swish, 44-33. 
</P>

SURE, NOW THEY'RE INTERESTED ; THE SCENARIO: PLAY IS REJECTED IN AMERICA. PLAY 
IS PRODUCED IN LONDON. PLAY IS A HIT. NOW, DAVID BEAIRD'S '900 ONEONTA' IS 
BOUND FOR BROADWAY -- AND MAYBE THE MOVIE SCREEN.

<P>
 American dramatist David Beaird is the talk of the town here -- all because of 
a play he insists was rejected by every major theater in America. 
</P>
<P>
 His semi-autobiographical "900 Oneonta" (the title refers to the street 
address of a rambling family mansion in Louisiana) opened at the Old Vic July 
18 to a chorus of praise from Britain's normally skeptical theater critics. 
</P>
<P>
 The London Daily Telegraph's Charles Spencer, who called "900 Oneonta" 
"astonishing," added: "Beaird's name will, I suspect, figure prominently when 
it comes to voting on the best new play of the year, and there will be no 
justice if the Old Vic doesn't play to a roaring trade for months to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Tinker of the London Daily Mail wrote: "An important new play . . . 
Beaird writes with a bold and dangerous dramatic vision . . . what an original 
storyteller this man is." Like other critics, he favorably compared Beaird (who 
also directed the play) to Tennessee Williams and Eugene O'Neill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wrote this script and we sent it to every theater in America," Beaird 
confirmed. "Wouldn't you think it would get a reading from at least one 
American theater somewhere? I even made a videotape, at a cost of $5,000 to 
myself, of a reading of the play, with the audience laughing and roaring. It 
made no difference. So why can I come to London, open the play and get all 
these terrific reviews? I want to know what that's about." 
</P>
<P>
 I n truth, "900 Oneonta" may have been too rich for the taste of most American 
theater managements in this era of political correctness. A brilliantly plotted 
slab of Southern Gothic, it deals with a bigoted, dysfunctional family made 
wealthy by the business cunning of Dandy, its dying patriarch, a foul-mouthed 
wildcat oilman. This family contains incest victims, a dopehead, a cancer 
patient, an alcoholic, two impotent men and a woman made infertile by an 
illegal teen-age abortion. The crux of the play is whether the family line will 
survive, and to whom the patriarch will leave his fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its heavy subject matter, "900 Oneonta" is savagely, outrageously 
funny, and critics here have praised comic performances by two American actors 
in its mainly British cast -- Leland Crooke as Dandy and Jon Cryer (best known 
for the film "Pretty in Pink" and the TV series "The Famous Teddy Z") as Gitlo, 
his grasping, sycophantic grandson. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, ironically, the London producers of "900 Oneonta" plan to take it to 
Broadway next year. And, says Beaird, a Hollywood studio and a currently hot 
production company are eager to secure film rights. Beaird declined to give the 
names of the companies. 
</P>
<P>
 This is ironic, too, for Beaird, 41, is a refugee from Hollywood; he wrote and 
directed seven films (including "My Chauffeur" and "Scorchers," a movie based 
on three one-act plays by Beaird which were first presented at Sherman Oaks' 
Whitefire Theatre), and wrote, produced and directed the canceled TV series 
"Key West" for Fox, before quitting town in disgust. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hell on earth," he says of "Key West." "I had committees of people 
standing over me, rewriting scenes. After a while the 27-year-old executives at 
the studio convinced me I didn't know what I was doing. I literally felt I was 
stupid, that I couldn't write at all. So I took the money when I got out of 
that experience, came to London and put on this play." 
</P>
<P>
 Beaird makes no secret of his loathing for Hollywood, and astonished London's 
theater community by penning a piece for the Guardian newspaper the week "900 
Oneonta" opened, in which he described himself as "a whore." 
</P>
<P>
 "I work in Hollywood," he wrote. "I know about lying and money. I know how to 
get movies made at the major studios. I know how to 'create and produce' a TV 
series. I know how to make a room full of executives think my idea was 'their' 
idea. I know about prostitution."  
</P>
<P>
 Beaird also argued in the Guardian that too many modern playwrights have 
abandoned plot and story. Pinter and Beckett were invaluable experiments, he 
claimed, but they had been copied in "a carnival of rip-offs -- two character 
plays on blank sets, which just happen to have cost the producers damn little 
money, while ticket prices stay astronomical." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's wrong with a rise in dramatic action and tension?" he wrote. "Were 
Shakespeare, Moliere, Tennessee Williams and Arthur Miller really that trite? I 
am screaming for a return to passion and heart-stopping excitement in the 
theatre." 
</P>
<P>
 The success of "900 Oneonta" and the publication of his views have made Beaird 
controversial; much speculation about him centers on how autobiographical his 
play is. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up in a dysfunctional family in an alcoholic community," Beaird 
admits. "A lot of those events are real, and some of the dialogue is direct 
dialogue. 
</P>
<P>
 "My basic theme is that bigotry, alcoholism and sexual abuse are all part of 
the same issue. I grew up in Shreveport, La., in a bigoted community. I think 
of myself as a recovering bigot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to go to a church where they spent $10,000 a month to keep the organ 
in tune, but they wouldn't let black people in. In the backyard of the school I 
grew up in, they'd set up crosses on Friday nights for KKK meetings. There was 
time when a person who was abused as a child or raped was not marriageable -- 
they became the old aunt locked up in the closet. So, yes, the play is partly 
autobiographical." 
</P>
<P>
 He insists that only after "900 Oneonta" has opened on Broadway will he allow 
talk of a film. He is now in pre-production on a movie he has written and will 
direct for MGM, "Wasted Grace."  
</P>
<P>
 A return to being a whore, then? Beaird grins. "Half whore, half artist, I 
hope. I've learned there's only one way to deal with Hollywood -- strictly on 
your own terms."*

 SUMMER BELLS: August may not seem like a school month, but a growing number of 
Orange County students have returned to the classroom. Enrollment in year-round 
schools has almost tripled since 1990. Ten school districts now have a total of 
59 schools running year-round. . . . Says a Capistrano Unified district 
spokeswoman: "There's widespread interest by parents to look at different 
calendar options."

 STREET FIGHTING: You can become really attached to your street name, like . .

change to "Medical Way." . . . Earl Keegan, who runs the Beverly Manor Nursing 
Center on nearby Hospital Circle -- where Westminster Hospital used to be -- is 
behind the move. "We need to let potential patients know this is still a 
medical area," he says. But residents don't want the hassle of notifying 
friends and business contacts about the address change. The city is asking 
Keegan for more details.

Harriett M. Wieder will be feted next month for her 30 years in politics. . . . 
Although Wieder has represented Huntington Beach and northwest Orange County

GAYS EXAMINE SERIOUS ISSUES AT UCI FESTIVAL; COMMUNITY: PRIDE CELEBRATION 
INCLUDES SEMINARS TO MARK 25TH ANNIVERSARY OF STONEWALL RIOTS THAT USHERED IN 
RIGHTS MOVEMENT. THE EVENT CONTINUES TODAY WITH MUSIC, FOOD, MERCHANDISE AND 
DISCUSSIONS.

 There was plenty of the usual music, art exhibits, food and good cheer at the 
sixth annual Orange County Gay & Lesbian Pride Celebration at UC Irvine on 
Saturday, but festival-goers and organizers also had serious subjects on their 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the festival featured a series of issue awareness seminars 
to recognize the 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots, which launched the 
country's gay rights movement in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 There also were talks about hate crimes against gays, media coverage of gay 
issues, spirituality and self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 "A gay child is often raised in the enemy camp," said San Clemente artist John 
Breitweiser, who spoke of how gays need to "learn to love ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our journey to self-acceptance and self-love is often littered with the 
experiences of self-destructive behaviors and self-loathing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The event drew about 2,000 people to Aldrich Park. It continues today and will 
be highlighted by a parade around campus at noon. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the topic of homosexuality and religion dominated much of the 
afternoon's seminars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have felt alienated from our religion," said 29-year-old speaker John 
Good. "But we don't want to be on the outside looking in. There is a spiritual 
side of us that needs to be filled." 
</P>
<P>
 Good, who represented Koinonia (Greek for community), a Catholic outreach 
group for gays and lesbians in Orange County, said he was encouraged by the 
dozen booths on the festival grounds representing various churches and 
religious organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more religious groups are becoming involved in these festivals, 
which I think is an interesting phenomenon," he said. "For so many years, we've 
had to work so hard in the political realm, and we've done a fantastic job of 
that. But, I think a lot of energy has been taken away from the spiritual side 
of us." 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Lail, former assistant press secretary for U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms, gave a 
seminar on "proactive religion" and said: "Churches are realizing that the 
Gospel of Jesus Christ was all about inclusion." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the seminars, the festival features an Art Expo that displays 
the work of Breitweiser and other artists. Several singers, bands and comedians 
were also on hand to provide entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there are more than 140 booths set up on the festival grounds 
representing various causes such as AIDS awareness; and vendors selling 
T-shirts, compact discs, cellular telephones and jewelry. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite oppressive heat, many of those in attendance said they relished the 
opportunity to walk around the festival grounds at Aldrich Park and just be 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Usually, if you try and hold hands in a public place, you would have fear of 
retaliation or a drive-by shooting," said 32-year-old Lisa Marks, who strolled 
holding a beer in one hand and her girlfriend's hand in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think straight people take for granted how wonderful it is to be able to be 
able to hold hands in public," Marks said. "I'm not so much afraid of offending 
people -- I don't do it because it's not safe." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Plesa, 43, said, "It's comfortable being here. It seems so peaceful and 
everyone is so friendly." 
</P>
<P>
 Festival spokeswoman Kimberly Syre said this year's event has been a 
refreshing contrast to the celebration's early years when the event was marred 
by protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people appreciate that we can have our celebration in peace," Syre 
said. "I think the gay community has come a long way and at the same time, I 
think the straight community has come a long way in letting us have this event 
without picketing the gates." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the festival will run from 11 a.m. to 10 p.m. For the first time, 
participants will leave the festival grounds at noon and march around the 
perimeter of the campus. The parade begins at Berkeley Avenue, turns left on 
Campus Drive and continues to Bridge Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost is $10. Entry fees will be half price today for those who also 
attended the festival on Saturday.

THEFT RING SOLD CARS IN EUROPE, AUTHORITIES SAY; CRIME: FOUR ROMANIAN NATIONALS 
JAILED AFTER FIVE-MONTH INVESTIGATION. 'THEY MADE A LOT OF MONEY' TAKING JEEPS, 
CARAVANS AND VOYAGERS FROM BEACH CITIES, ALLEGES HEAD OF CHP TASK FORCE.

<P>
 Four men have been arrested on suspicion of operating a lucrative car theft 
ring that shipped automobiles stolen from Orange County beach cities to Europe 
for sale, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The four suspects, all Romanian nationals, were arrested during a sweep by 60 
undercover investigators Friday in Riverside County and charged with 19 
felonies, said Lt. Rick Criner, commander of the California Highway Patrol's 
Orange County auto theft task force. 
</P>
<P>
 Criner said the arrests culminated more than five months of investigation of a 
ring responsible for the theft of at least 75 cars, most from beach cities in 
Orange County. The thieves targeted Jeeps, Dodge Caravans and Plymouth 
Voyagers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They prefer the larger cars, but they would also hit a few sports cars if one 
caught their fancy," said Criner, adding that more arrests could be made soon. 
"This was a huge deal for us. These guys were very, very hard to catch." 
</P>
<P>
 Criner estimated the value of the stolen cars at $750,000 to $1.5 million. 
"They made a lot of money. We're not talking peanuts here," Criner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Being held at Orange County Jail in lieu of $100,000 bond each were Cornel 
George, 30, of Riverside; Ion Gheorghe, 35, of Riverside; Adrian Gheorghe, 22, 
of San Bernardino; and Latislau Molnar, 18, of Perris. 
</P>
<P>
 The felony charges against them include conspiracy to commit vehicle theft; 
vehicle theft;, operation of a vehicle "chop shop;" altering, recovering or 
destroying vehicle identification numbers and receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 Molnar was arrested at a ranch in Perris that investigators allege was being 
used as a chop shop, a place where stolen cars are altered and wrecks are 
stripped for parts and destroyed, Criner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities also believe that George's auto dealership, Import Auto Sales in 
Riverside, was used as a second chop shop, Criner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Criner said ring members would frequent automobile auctions and buy wrecked 
late-model cars that insurance companies had deemed too badly damaged to be 
fixed. But the theft ring members bought the wrecks for their identification 
numbers, which were transferred to the stolen cars, Criner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The stolen cars were then re-registered with new identification numbers and 
salvage receipts, packed in containers and shipped by boat to Germany for sale 
in Europe, particularly in Romania, Criner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The paperwork will say they are salvaged vehicles, but these cars are in 
pristine condition," Criner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the cars were also sold locally to unsuspecting buyers through 
automobile magazines or newspaper ads, Criner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recovered a Plymouth Voyager an innocent purchaser had paid $13,000 for 
and only had two days," Criner said. Unfortunately, the purchaser loses the 
money and the car, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "The innocent purchasers get stung real hard," Criner said. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 11 cars were recovered, some of them already packed in their 
shipping containers, Criner said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aiding the county's task force in the investigation were the FBI, the state 
Department of Motor Vehicles, the National Insurance Crime Bureau, the 
Riverside County Auto Theft Interdiction Detail, the Riverside County Sheriff's 
Department and the CHP's Inland Division vehicle theft unit.

SOME BAKE, SOME BASK AS SIZZLING HEAT CONTINUES; WEATHER: MORE THAN 250,000

 Orange County beaches were jammed Saturday with more than 250,000 people 
seeking relief from the unrelenting heat wave. But Jim Spencer of Mission Viejo 
dodged the crowds and scorching weather to work on his tan elsewhere -- nude 
and surrounded by 30 ultraviolet lamps at a Lake Forest tanning salon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people are probably thinking why do you come to a place like this when 
it's 100 degrees outside?" said Spencer, 36. "It's a lot cooler in here, and 
the atmosphere is better." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, temperatures reached 100 degrees in Fullerton, Lake Forest and 
Tustin. It also hit 100 in Santa Ana, which tied the city's record high for the 
date. Dana Point was a bit cooler at 88 degrees, while lifeguards in Newport 
Beach reported a high of 86. 
</P>
<P>
 More of the same is expected for today and Monday. The source of all the hot 
air is high-pressure clouds moving in from northern New Mexico, said Curtis 
Brack, a meteorologist with WeatherData, which provides forecasts for The 
Times. 
</P>
<P>
 The highs today and Monday are expected to peak around 102 degrees inland and 
remain in the upper 70s at the coast, Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 After Monday, conditions should begin to let up -- at least by a few degrees, 
Brack said. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was no hint of relief Saturday as thousands flocked to Orange County 
beaches -- in numbers more typical of Labor Day and Fourth of July weekends, 
lifeguards said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people were reluctant to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 By late afternoon, "they were still in the water in droves," said Eric Bauer, 
a Newport Beach lifeguard. He said about 115,000 people came to the city's 
beach Saturday; usual weekend crowds there hover around 80,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Bauer said there were about 150 rescues. One woman suffered from heat 
exhaustion and was taken to a local hospital, where she was in stable 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 About 95,000 journeyed to city and state beaches in Huntington Beach, 35,000 
to Laguna Beach and 25,000 to Seal Beach, where thousands also showed up for a 
volleyball tournament on the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's bumping bodies on the beach," said Seal Beach lifeguard Cliff Kjoss. 
"It's fun. It's a great day at the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Even past sunset, Seal Beach was hopping. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are millions of people still in the water," Kjoss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some inland business owners nevertheless enjoyed a boom from sweltering 
conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 At Pep Boys Service, nine of 10 cars sitting in the service garage were 
awaiting air-conditioning repair. 
</P>
<P>
 During hot weather, "people are real impatient," said Hector Montoya, 
assistant service manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want it done like this," he said, snapping his fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Business also was booming at the 4 Seasons Suntanning Salon in Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-owner Celeste Avellana said the heat wave drew customers hoping to escape 
the weather in an air-conditioned booth. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to make it look like they've been in the sun all day," said 
Avellana. "They can look like they've been getting sunshine without baking out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Jim Spencer was listening to music and napping during a 30-minute 
visit to the salon.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to worry about getting sand (all over your body), or worry 
about the sun beating on you," he said. Hot, Hot, Hot 
</P>
<P>
 The heat wave continued to blanket Orange County Saturday. Here are some high 
temperatures:

A GRIEF THAT IS SHARED; MOTHER OF SLAIN HONOR STUDENT MAKES TENTATIVE FORAY

 Orange homemaker Linda Tay joined Gov. Pete Wilson at a news conference last 
week to support his anti-crime package calling for tough treatment of juvenile 
offenders -- such as the teens convicted of killing her 17-year-old son on New 
Year's Eve, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay said she believes there is no stronger force to be reckoned with than a 
mother or father of a murdered child. But she also is tentative about her foray 
into the public arena, saying she still struggles with her grief daily and does 
not know whether the mantle of activism is one she can carry. 
</P>

 "I still don't have a sense of myself yet. I'm dealing with this every day, 
every hour, every minute," she said, her voice breaking. "I don't know what 
else I can do. And I mean I don't know if I can do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Her son, Stuart A. Tay, was an honor student at Foothill High School in Santa 
Ana and wanted to be a doctor like his father. His life was cut short by five 
teen-agers who believed Tay was about to double-cross them in a planned robbery 
of a computer-parts dealer. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay attended Monday's sentencing of Robert C. Chan, the 19-year-old mastermind 
of the murder ring, and she wept as she asked the judge to show no leniency. 
Chan was later sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole -- 
the second of the two assailants who have already been sentenced. 
</P>
<P>
 For Linda Tay, it was just one more small step in a seemingly never-ending 
process. The three remaining defendants will be sentenced later this year, and 
Tay plans to attend each hearing, just as she attended each day of two separate 
trials in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay said she wants the remaining juveniles to spend the rest of their lives in 
prison, and she will fight any efforts to parole them.  
</P>
<P>
 The mother also is contemplating the future and how she will go on with her 
life. There are painful reminders everywhere she turns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't even feel happy in my house anymore," she said. "When I come into the 
garage, Stuart's skis are hanging by the door. His snowboard leans against the 
wall. His pictures are all throughout the house. What should I do? Burn it 
all?" 
</P>
<P>
 "His room has a little seat, an alcove, and when I garden I look up and see 
that window seat and I know that there is nobody there anymore. It ruins your 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after her son's slaying, she was invited to join the local chapter of 
Parents of Murdered Children and has frequently been called upon to attend 
public rallies decrying violence. Last week, she appeared alongside the 
governor at a news conference in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Tay said she believes such events and organizations are the key to change, but 
she also knows it will mean a constant and painful reminder of her loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the only people out there who can understand and really do this," Tay 
said. "Ordinary people -- people who have not experienced such a tragedy, whose 
lives have not been devastated -- they are not really able to feel what we are 
going through." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tay does not blame then. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have the luxury of going back to their own lives. I have to say I was 
that way before Stuart was killed. You pick up the paper, you read about 
someone being murdered, and you so 'Oh, that's so horrible, we feel so sorry,' 
but then you go back to your life and forget about it."

DANA PARSONS: THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW AGAINST CRIME-BILL DELINQUENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons

<TEXT>
<P>
 I don't know from nothin' about the crime bill. Didn't like it, didn't dislike 
it, didn't follow it, didn't cry when it got ambushed last week. Don't care if 
they bring it back or not. 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the national debate on crime, you see more bad acting than at 
a grade school Christmas play. The big difference is, the kids are cute and 
they don't charge you anything. 
</P>
<P>
 The thespians in Congress, however, are not beyond such shame. They recite 
over and over how serious they are about crime, but then proceed to turn it 
into farce. 
</P>
<P>
 And they wonder why we're cynical. 
</P>
<P>
 My own little theory, held for some time now, is that no one is really as 
serious about crime as they say. We're all horrified by the splashy crime that 
we read or hear about, but for many of us crime remains an abstraction. We know 
that it can happen to any of us, but the truth is, it seldom does. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent FBI figures show that the overall crime rate dropped 4% 
between 1991 and 1992, the most recent year for which statistics are available. 
Violent crimes declined negligibly, but property crimes dropped more 
significantly, about 4.6%. Believe it or not, the murder rate is lower than it 
was in 1990. And while no one is suggesting that we all feel safe and secure, 
the chances that any of us will be victimized by violent crime are less than 1 
in 100. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether all that has any bearing on Congress, who knows. But you'd think that 
if its members were as fired up about crime as their public statements would 
suggest, they'd pass almost anything. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the crime bill went up in a puff of smoke before it even got to a 
House vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The beauty of this year's bill was that it contained so many disparate 
elements that everybody could find something they liked. It put more cops on 
the street and more money into prevention. It built new prisons and included 
"three strikes and you're out" provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, there was so much stuff in the bill that it gave everybody a 
chance to find something they didn't like, upon which they could hang a 
naysaying vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The ultimate cynicism about the bogus war on crime is that an odd coalition 
formed to derail the bill. Some Republicans said it included too much needless 
spending, while others caved in to the National Rifle Assn. because it opposed 
the provision that would ban assault weapons. Some Democrats opposed it because 
it expanded the categories of crimes eligible for the death penalty. Others, no 
doubt, voted against it just because they oppose whatever President Clinton 
supports. Or, others probably wanted to teach the President a lesson for other 
slights he's committed against them. That's how serious they are about fighting 
crime. 
</P>
<P>
 And President Clinton is probably part of the cynic's scenario too. He thought 
he had a slam-dunk crime bill that he could call his own and use as political 
cachet. 
</P>
<P>
 You're darn right that when it comes to talk about crime, I'm suspicious of 
everybody. 
</P>
<P>
 You can bet that every nay vote came from someone who has lamented the rampant 
crime in society. Yet all the no voters, including the entire Orange County 
delegation, were willing to set those fears aside and find a reason to oppose 
the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 I may be less aggrieved about the bill's demise than the average voter, 
because I tuned out to the "law and order" cry somewhere during the Nixon-Agnew 
Administration. I can't remember for sure if it was after Spiro Agnew was 
caught by the Justice Department taking bribes and before a grand jury wanted 
to indict Nixon over Watergate, or the other way around -- but, anyway, their 
plaintive cries for law and order left me a tad cold. 
</P>
<P>
 Every President introduces a crime bill and every candidate rails against 
crime, as the California governor's race is showing us in dreary detail. 
Everyone is against crime, but in our lifetimes, no one has done anything about 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The most humane thing for the safety of the republic would be to focus on 
preventing crime, but you know where that argument has gone over the last 
generation or so. So, the argument shifts to more police and more prisons, but 
no one really wants to pay for them. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps it's best to keep a sense of humor about crime. After all, it is the 
classic dog-and-pony show. 
</P>
<P>
 Be assured, that legislators and candidates will keep talking about it and 
introducing bills that either get watered down or killed by the other side. 
Part of it is sport, but it's also because no one really knows what to do about 
crime, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, President Clinton is talking angrily about trying to revive 
the bill that got blindsided. 
</P>
<P>
 And why not? They know we just eat this stuff up.

CRASH KILLS 3 ABOARD FIREFIGHTING AIRCRAFT; ACCIDENT: LOADED C-130 TANKER WAS 
ON ITS WAY TO A BLAZE. IT BREAKS INTO PIECES IN A RUGGED PART OF THE ANTELOPE 
VALLEY. 
</P>

<P>
 A C-130 firefighting aircraft on its way to a blaze in Kern County exploded in 
midair Saturday, killing the three people on board and sending a huge fireball 
vaulting into the sky after the plane crashed in rugged canyon country in the 
Antelope Valley, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft, which was carrying fire retardant, broke into pieces and sparked 
two small brush fires on the side of Pallet Mountain, about 25 miles south of 
Palmdale in Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires blackened about five acres and were contained by U.S. Forest Service 
and Los Angeles County Fire Department crews by late Saturday, fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Forest Service spokesman said rescuers will retrieve the bodies today. 
Spokesman Terry Ellis said the three were employees of the Hemet Valley Flying 
Service, which owned the plane and contracted it out to the Forest Service to 
help combat fires. 
</P>
<P>
 National Transportation Safety Board investigators will hike to the crash site 
today to try to determine the cause of the crash, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be a mountain climber to get up there," said Los Angeles County 
sheriff's Lt. Antonio Madrid, who was at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, authorities believed two planes had collided in midair because of 
the explosion and brush fires. But, Madrid said, the plane "apparently caught 
on fire before it crashed. . . . We now believe the plane was cut in half." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Edwards Air Force Base said that its control tower was 
tracking the plane and that it disappeared from the radar screen about 1:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane, a privately owned C-130 Hercules, was being leased by the Forest 
Service to help fight fires throughout the country, said Roger Richcreek, a 
Forest Service spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the plane lost altitude and exploded before it slammed into the 
mountainside near Devil's Punch Bowl, a Los Angeles County park known for its 
unusual rock formations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were driving up when we noticed this large plane that seemed to be flying 
too low," said Sheri Multer of Fontana, who was in the area with her daughter 
and nephew. "It just exploded into a ball of flames. One of the wings shot off 
and the body of the plane kept flying off. . . . I feel sorry for whoever was 
in the plane." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Hogan, 68, who was part of a foursome golfing at Crystalaire Country 
Club in nearby Llano, said the plane was on fire and tumbling through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had flames shooting out of it, and making a sputtering sound," he said. "I 
knew it was going down. . . . Then I saw and heard a huge explosion. It was a 
huge ball of flame and smoke that probably went 500 feet into the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Several seconds after the first explosion, Hogan said, he saw the aircraft 
slam into the mountainside and heard another crashing sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like this in my life," he said. "It was louder than 
a sonic boom. It was awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 David Sandoval of Carson City, Nev., said he was on his way with a friend to 
Devil's Punch Bowl when the friend pointed out the plane before it crashed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see any parachutes," Sandoval said. "Whoever was in that plane went 
down with it. It happened so fast I don't think even the pilot knew what was 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 30 planes leased by the Forest Service are C-130 cargo planes 
converted to carry fire-retardant chemicals, officials said. The planes carry a 
maximum of three passengers, including the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 The air tankers are very effective at fighting fires because they can fly at 
fairly slow speeds, are highly maneuverable and are able to drop fire retardant 
with great accuracy, Richcreek said. 
</P>
<P>
 During fire season, the planes roam the country, going from one blaze to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The C-130 that went down Saturday was en route to a brush fire in central Kern 
County believed to have been started by lightning. The Northrop fire, which 
burned 75 acres, was contained Saturday afternoon, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightning has ignited dozens of such fires on the desert side of Angeles 
National Forest over the last three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the tanker planes handle air traffic control themselves, they usually 
check in with local Forest Service crews when they arrive at a fire, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richcreek said he did not know if the plane that went down attempted to 
communicate with Angeles National Forest rangers because of the heavy radio 
traffic generated because of the brush fires.

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: PREDICTING BLACK JURORS' VOTES ON SIMPSON NO EASY 
TASK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A favorite editor often told me that when you don't know anything about the 
story you're writing, the best thing to do is talk to lots of people and ask 
them plenty of questions. 
</P>
<P>
 I thought of that advice from Ed Guthman, now a USC journalism professor, as I 
tried to figure out how to write about race and the O.J. Simpson murder case. 
</P>
<P>
 It's been part of the case from the beginning, and for understandable reasons. 
An African American sports hero is accused of murdering his ex-wife and her 
friend, both white. Simpson was arrested and is being tried in a city where, in 
the belief of many African Americans, the police and courts routinely treat 
blacks unjustly. Who could ignore the racial factor here, where so many races 
live in uneasy proximity? 
</P>
<P>
 This set of circumstances has helped make the case the No. 1 conversation 
piece here and elsewhere. People have drawn conclusions and are arguing about 
them in detail even though Simpson isn't scheduled to go on trial until next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 We've heard, for example, whites say that there will be a hung jury if African 
Americans are among the jurors. Blacks, they say, won't vote against a brother. 
The other day, an African American man told me he too believed that at least 
some blacks on the jury would oppose conviction, no matter what. There had been 
too many years of unjust treatment of blacks by police and the courts for the 
result to be otherwise, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This may be true. But one thing I've learned in my years as a reporter is that 
people are so complicated you can't predict what they'll do. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that juries, once formed, have a life of their own. I've seen these 
group dynamics at work in my own jury service in minor criminal trials. My 
brother Jeff, a criminal defense lawyer, tells me that he notices how groups 
form in juries. He usually can predict who will be elected foreperson when the 
jury begins deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 So no matter what I've been told about blacks on juries, I know there is more 
to the story. I listened to the voice of my former editor, and started talking 
to people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I started on a recent Saturday with a Rep. Maxine Waters youth forum that was 
designed to air the views of young people on a variety of issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The room in the Armory Building at Exposition Park was packed with tables of 
men and women in their late teens and early 20s, discussing life in this place 
of so many races and tensions. 
</P>
<P>
 I picked a table where a small group was talking about the media. What struck 
me immediately is how much they distrust us. "I see (television) as 
sensationalist," said an African American woman. "I don't think there's a 
balance. . . . They'll spend 10 minutes on the fact that Hispanics and African 
Americans were fighting, but how much will they talk about how we sat here and 
spoke together and did something positive? That irritates me." 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what I think about the media?" said an African American man. "It's a 
job. They don't really care about what's happening. They've just got to 
compete. The news says O.J. killed his ex-wife and her lover. They don't really 
know. They just rushed in. A real news (organization) would have somebody 
investigate it or something." 
</P>
<P>
 What they said fit in with public opinion polls showing widespread disapproval 
of the media. A Los Angeles Times Poll in June found that 67% of those surveyed 
said the media have behaved irresponsibly in the Simpson case. Blacks felt that 
way 87% to 8%, whites 72% to 20% and Latinos 54% to 34%. 
</P>
<P>
 What has been overlooked in the discussion of race and the Simpson case is 
what impact the media have on prospective jurors who don't trust the news 
accounts they see on TV or read. Have all the lawyers, trying to shape the 
news, been wasting their time on a hostile or unreceptive audience? 
</P>
<P>
 Another point that has been overlooked is the strong law and order feeling in 
the African American community, which could counter pro-Simpson feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a complex subject. Los Angeles blacks disapprove of the police in 
higher numbers than whites and Latinos, according to the Times poll, although 
they, like other groups, generally approve of the department. The lower rating 
no doubt stems from a strong feeling, supported by outrageous cases, that the 
LAPD unjustly hassles and arrests African Americans, especially young men. 
</P>
<P>
 I talked to African Americans who said years of such abuse are responsible for 
higher sympathy for Simpson among blacks than in other ethnic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 But blacks also feel less safe in their neighborhoods than other Angelenos, 
and many of those who terrorize them are black criminals. These mixed emotions 
were evident Thursday night at a meeting of AGENDA, a group that is working to 
give South-Central L.A. residents more power in shaping the LAPD's new 
community-policing program. 
</P>
<P>
 They wanted respect from the cops. But there were many nods and murmurs of 
agreement when Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas said: "The No. 1 
issue is public safety. People want to have a sense of safety and security. I 
don't know of anyone who doesn't. Yet too many of us don't feel safe." 
</P>
<P>
 These are people who have no patience for crime, for the crack houses, 
prostitution motels and drug markets in Laundromats and liquor store parking 
lots. Will the difficult circumstances of daily life have an impact when such 
African American jurors deliberate? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the week, I was reminded of another force that complicates the racial 
issue in the Simpson case. 
</P>
<P>
 I talked to Melanie Lomax, a civil rights attorney who led the fight to oust 
Police Chief Daryl F. Gates when she was president of the Los Angeles Board of 
Police Commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the issue of spousal abuse, and the fact that Simpson abused his 
ex-wife. This, she felt, should have an impact on jurors. We wondered what 
would happen if some of the jurors were black women over 40 with, as she put 
it, life's experience. How would they react? 
</P>
<P>
 That could be a crucial point in the outcome of the trial. We'll tackle that 
in another column.

WHO LEFT THE SAUNA ON?; HEAT: MANY ANGELENOS SHRUG OFF SEARING TEMPERATURES BY 
LOUNGING IN GRIFFITH PARK OR JOINING THE ESTIMATED 1 MILLION PEOPLE AT THE 
BEACH. SOME GOLFERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF SPARSE CROWDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It continued to be hot, searingly hot, but Saturday was still Saturday, a day 
for play and errands -- and at least some Angelenos were out and about under 
the shimmering sun. They played soccer and golf, tended hot barbecue grills, 
and occasionally scoffed at weather weenies who retreated from the great hot 
outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in places way hotter than this -- Saudi Arabia," said Herlindo 
Landavazo, 23, reclining on a blanket in Griffith Park, next to his fiancee, 
22-year-old Tina Banuelos. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were among a number of people who found a sloped stretch of park 
shaded by large trees. Most were refugees from houses and apartments without 
air conditioning, and they came stocked with water, soft drinks, ice cream and 
beach towels. A surprisingly strong breeze blew dry and warm but at least it 
was an alternative to a stifling house. 
</P>
<P>
 "The air is fresh," said Raoul Lara, who was bare-chested and sipping a can of 
7Up. "There's no pollution and there are lots of trees." He and his wife and 
young son ditched their South-Central home to stake out a spot under one of the 
trees. 
</P>
<P>
 Norma Escobedo and her family had planned an afternoon in Griffith Park, and a 
little heat wouldn't deter them. Escobedo even maintained her usual modest 
dress code -- she was encased in long, black pants. "I'm not used to shorts," 
said Escobedo, 28, who looked comfortable. She brought along a soccer ball. 
("Yeah, we're going to play.") And nearby, her mother, Eloisa Huizar, stood 
over a grill, fanning still-black coals, for the carne asada they would 
prepare. "It's easy cooking," Huizar said, smiling and wiping her brow with the 
back of her hand, her fingers stained by the charcoals she was coaxing. "It's 
terrible in the house. It's not bad here." 
</P>
<P>
 For the record: The high at Santa Monica Pier was a balmy 85. The Downtown 
Civic Center reached 102. And if you wanted Lycra-melting temperatures you had 
to be in Monrovia, where the high was 108. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the beach beckoned many overbaked residents. Los Angeles County 
lifeguards said that nearly 1 million people flocked to the beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the biggest crowds, if not the biggest of the season," said 
lifeguard spokesman Mickey Gallagher. 
</P>
<P>
 The extensive crowds moved lifeguards to wax poetic. "It looks like a sea of 
umbrellas to the Manhattan Beach Pier," county Lifeguard Ed Craig said. "It's 
kind of pretty." 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County beaches were also jammed, so Jim Spencer of Mission Viejo opted 
to forgo the crowds and work on his tan elsewhere -- nude and surrounded by 30 
ultraviolet lamps at a Lake Forest tanning salon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people are probably thinking, 'Why do you come to a place like this when 
it's 100 degrees outside?' " said Spencer, 36. "It's a lot cooler in here, and 
the atmosphere is better." 
</P>
<P>
 Others sought out the places they love to go, figuring the heat would drive 
the crowds away. This logic worked perfectly at the Roosevelt Golf Course in 
Griffith Park. On a usual Saturday, the parking lot would be overflowing and 
the waiting list would be long. "You'd have to wait an hour or two to play," 
said Tom Redditt, supervisor of the course. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Saturday, it was virtually deserted. A few golfers hunched over their 
tees. A course staffer, immaculate in pith helmet, crisp white shirt and black 
pants, stood in the middle of the course watering the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nobody out there, it's wide open, and they have the sprinklers on," 
said golfer Joe Salinas, 31, an internist, as he pulled his golf clubs out of 
his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Other golfers, finished with an early morning round, sat out the midafternoon 
sun on the covered patio chatting, drinking beer and playing gin. "There are 
only two kinds of people who are out here," said Jose Luis Ruiz, who works in 
public broadcasting. "Mad dogs and Englishmen. I'm a mad dog." 
</P>
<P>
 But Salinas was about to play his second round. "What heat?" Salinas chuckled. 
"It's not bad. I'm of Mediterranean descent. I was made for this." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a love of golf involved here," said his golfing partner, Marcel Motz, 
a 34-year-old nurse. "We could either go to the beach or hit the links. The 
links won." 
</P>
<P>
 But back on the scorching pavements of the cities, wilting residents went 
grimly about their business on foot. Asked to comment on coping with the heat,

 "I notice it, it makes me perspire, but I can live with it," said attorney 
Scott Hodgkins, who was out running errands with his wife, Ruth Kokka, an 
accountant, and their baby. "We just bring water."

 And some Pasadena strollers did the natural thing -- they ducked into the cool 
interiors of boutiques. "She cools off when she shops," said Jenkins Chiang of 
West Covina referring to his cousin, Michelle Wang, visiting from out of town, 
as they walked along Colorado Boulevard in Pasadena pondering which store to 
visit next. Actually, Wang is rather accustomed to the heat. She's from 
Houston.

 "This is fine with me," she said. "It's usual."

SMOKING BAN CATCHES NEW FIRE IN ROLLING HILLS; SOUTH BAY: LIGHTING UP IS 
ALLOWED ONLY INSIDE HOMES. ON THE BOOKS SINCE 1978, THE LAW WILL NOW BE 
ENFORCED, OFFICIALS SAY.

 If you walk in Rolling Hills, don't smoke. If you drive in Rolling Hills, 
don't smoke. And if you sit in your own back yard in Rolling Hills, don't 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The gated South Bay community with a population of just under 2,000 may be the 
only place in America where people can smoke only inside their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the ban has been in effect since 1978, enforcement has been loose. 
But now, city officials intend to get tough and strictly enforce the policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Thursday, visitors are being given yellow flyers alerting them that 
smoking is not allowed in the city if they are driving, walking or standing 
outside a building. No-smoking signs are posted at city gates.  
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Craig R. Nealis said the rule is based on a Los Angeles County 
code prohibiting smoking in areas considered to be a fire hazard. He maintains 
that the entire three-square-mile city, made up entirely of private homes on 
large wooded lots, is a fire hazard. Only City Hall, where smoking is also 
prohibited, lies outside the city gates. 
</P>
<P>
 National, state and county fire officials say they have never heard of another 
city with such a stringent policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where there is such a blanket prohibition on smoking," said Jeff 
Shapiro, coordinator of the International Fire Code Institute, which is based 
in Austin, Tex.  
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Allen Gooch, with the Los Angeles County Fire Department, agreed.  
</P>
<P>
 "For someone to go into their back yard and not be able to fire up a cigar and 
watch the sunset, that seems very strict," Gooch said. "I'm not saying it's 
wrong. I'm saying it's strict." 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling Hills officials cite past fires in the city, which is full of 
tree-lined streets without sidewalks, as the reason for the ban. A 1973 blaze 
sparked by fireworks destroyed 13 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved a plan to pass out the flyers after Mayor Pro Tem 
Godfrey Pernell recently spotted a gardener smoking while doing some 
landscaping. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I'm driving by, he lights up," Pernell said. "It was the wrong time."  
</P>
<P>
 Violators could be fined up to $1,000 and receive up to six months in jail, 
Assistant City Atty. Kevin Ennis said. Officials sent copies of the flyers to 
the Los Angeles County Sheriff's and Fire departments, both of which serve the 
city, and asked that they be more vigilant in looking for code violators. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The community has declared itself a forested area, which allows it to ban 
smoking outside any building under state and county fire codes, Ennis said. But 
in the past, guards at the three city gates only warned people against smoking 
during fire season.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies, who patrol the city, do not keep statistics on minor fire 
infractions but do not recall citing anyone for breaking the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that the law exists and we know some citations may be issued," Sgt. 
Hector Zabala said. "If they are (smoking) on the front porch or the back 
porch, it depends on the circumstances. It might happen, and you might issue a 
citation for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Rolling Hills, which sits on the Palos Verdes Peninsula and is surrounded by 
the cities of Rolling Hills Estates and Rancho Palos Verdes, was founded in 
1936 as a dude ranch and incorporated as a city in 1957. The median selling 
price of a home this year is $1.2 million, according to a South Bay real estate 
service. Visitors may enter only with the permission of a resident or the 
community association, which maintains the winding streets and dirt trails. 
(The new flyer also warns visitors to obey the 25 m.p.h. speed limit and to 
"watch for horses.") 
</P>
<P>
 Officials point to the city's rural nature as one reason for the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no sidewalks. There are no street lights. There are peacocks 
running across the street," said Nealis, the city manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Most visitors and residents passing through the city's main gate Friday 
supported the smoking restrictions.  
</P>
<P>
 "It takes living up here to know what the ban means," said Belinda L. Harris, 
35, who lives in Los Angeles but was visiting her boss. "It is very dry up 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 One resident did have some unkind words for the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's crud," said Linda Luppo, who says she smokes but not in her 
house or her car because she doesn't like the smell. The only place she enjoys 
a cigarette is outdoors. "If I spend this much money on my property, I figure I 
can go out on my own property and smoke a cigarette." 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis, the assistant city attorney, said he is unaware of anyone who has 
challenged the city's interpretation of the fire codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lauria, a spokesman for the Tobacco Institute in Washington, said he 
understood the need to prohibit smoking in areas such as hospitals, but 
questioned a ban that extended into private cars and back yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wait till the tobacco farmers in North Carolina hear about this one," he 
said. No Lighting Up 
</P>
<P>
 No smoking is allowed in Rolling Hills, a gated city of about 2,000. Local 
officials maintain that the city -- with private homes on large, wooded lots -- 
is a fire hazard, making the policy necessary.

TEACHERS OFTEN FIND PAY IS LINKED TO CLASS SIZE; EDUCATION: SOME DISTRICTS 
RAISE SALARIES RATHER THAN HIRE STAFF FOR MORE STUDENTS. 
</P>

 At Ventura High School, beginning teacher Jennifer Flittie will earn $24,540 
this year teaching five classes of general science and chemistry. 
</P>
<P>
 Just 30 miles away at Thousand Oaks High, Tracy Dietch will earn nearly $4,000 
more, $28,327, for her first year teaching five classes of Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 But Flittie will have classes of up to only 33 students, while Dietch will 
probably have classes of nearly 40. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Conejo Valley Unified School District has the best paid teachers 
in Ventura County, it also has some of the most crowded classes. 
</P>
<P>
 And that is no accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers in Conejo and many other districts in this county and across the 
state have deliberately traded smaller classes for better pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state Department of Education sets a cap on how many 
primary-grade children can be put into one class, there is no such maximum for 
older students. 
</P>
<P>
 And at a time when state funding to public schools is flat, the only way many 
teachers unions are able to get pay raises -- or avoid pay cuts -- is to agree 
to thin their ranks and accept more students. 
</P>
<P>
 In Conejo, for example, the number of students in most high school classes has 
grown from about 35 five years ago to 38 today, said John Uelmen, president of 
the United Assn. of Conejo Teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've been doing," Uelmen said, "is pretty much paying for higher 
salaries by allowing more students in the class. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's getting so bad that I feel sorry for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, in the Oxnard Union High School District, the teachers union has 
traditionally given a higher priority to salaries than to class size. 
</P>
<P>
 Big classes are big headaches, educators say. More students mean more papers 
to grade and less time to spend with individual children. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dick Butolph, past president of the Oxnard Federation of Teachers, said: 
"If there's one thing (teachers) don't want, it's a cut in pay. Nobody wants to 
increase class size. But you have got to have food, too." 
</P>
<P>
 California already crams more students into its public school classes than 
many other states. 
</P>
<P>
 The average class size in the state's elementary schools is 29, compared to 26 
nationwide. High school and junior high classes in the state have about two 
more students than the national average. 
</P>
<P>
 And Ventura County's classes tend to be as large as or bigger than the 
statewide average. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior high and middle schools in Ventura County had an average class size of 
30.5 last school year. 
</P>
<P>
 That is slightly higher than the state average of 29.8. And it marks a 
significant increase from the 29.0 countywide average five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The average class size in the county's high schools and elementary schools has 
also grown over the past several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Because statistical averages factor in small, specialized courses such as 
chemistry labs, they fail to reflect how large most classes actually are, 
officials say. But the averages provide a basis for comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Ventura County school districts follow a pattern: the larger their 
teachers' salaries, the bigger their classes. 
</P>
<P>
 In most districts, teachers unions negotiate a maximum class size with their 
districts at the same time they set salaries, insurance coverage and other 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 For some districts, the maximum class size is only a target that school 
officials agree to try to maintain. In others, the class size limit is 
absolute, with officials agreeing to transfer students out of classes that get 
too large. 
</P>
<P>
 And in a few districts, districts pay individual teachers a bonus either for 
their own personal use or for school supplies whenever the number of students 
in their classes exceeds the maximum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hueneme Elementary School District, for example, gives its primary-grade 
teachers a bonus of up to $300 per year for each student above the district 
maximum of 29 children per class. 
</P>
<P>
 But class size is not the only factor determining teachers' salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 The strength of a district's teachers union, the philosophy of its trustees 
and the amount of money available in the budget also play a part in how much 
teachers are paid. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Ventura Unified School District, teachers are in the unenviable 
position of having both low salaries and big classes compared to other county 
districts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ventura district has been burdened over the past several years by an 
insurance package for retirees that has drained millions of dollars from the 
district's budget. And teachers union officials say they expect the financial 
situation to improve now that the district has revamped its retiree benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Although numerous factors determine the size of teachers' paychecks, educators 
say class size is one of the most important considerations because it directly 
affects a teacher's working conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you took my classroom size and cut it down to 24, I'd feel adequately 
paid," said Mark Storer, who earns $29,000 a year teaching English at Simi 
Valley's Valley View Junior High. "But when you put 38 kids in a classroom, you 
are doubling my workload, effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers generally agree that bigger classes make the job much harder. 
</P>
<P>
 But experts are divided on whether class size affects how much students learn. 
</P>
<P>
 Some researchers have concluded that the number of students in a class has 
little impact on the quality of instruction. Other studies, however, have 
suggested otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Teachers Assn. cites a 1970 study by a Minneapolis research 
group that found teachers have fewer discipline problems in smaller classes and 
more opportunities to work with students one-to-one. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Uelmen said when his history classes at Thousand Oaks High School get 
too large, he has far more trouble with students. 
</P>
<P>
 Classes with 30 or fewer students typically have only one or two problem 
students, Uelmen said. But in classes with 34 or 35 students, there can be six 
or seven who are disruptive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you go above 30, the number of problem kids goes up" exponentially, 
Uelmen said. The students realize, he said, that there are too many of them for 
the teacher to control. "They find they can ignore what's going on in the class 
and do their own thing." 
</P>
<P>
 And Simi Valley teacher Mark Storer said he is a less effective instructor 
with large classes. 
</P>
<P>
 When Storer has too many students in his English classes at Valley View Junior 
High have too many students, he said, he is unable to adjust his teaching to 
the various abilities of his students. 
</P>
<P>
 "What ends up happening," he said, "is you start teaching to the lowest common 
denominator." 
</P>
<P>
 In light of such problems with big classes, teachers in some districts have 
agreed to take less pay in exchange for fewer students. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Oak Park Unified School District -- where students consistently 
outperform their peers around the county on standardized tests -- first-year 
teachers armed with college degrees and teaching credentials earn as little as 
$21,621. 
</P>
<P>
 But the average size of classes at Oak Park's high school and elementary 
schools is lower than most other schools in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current negotiations between the Oak Park teachers' union and the 
district, class size is one of the issues on the table. But, Supt. Marilyn 
Lippiatt said, both the district and the union are trying to avoid boosting 
class size in order to raise salaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "Class size is the easy alternative," Lippiatt said. "It is one way to 
generate income when there is no new money." But, she said, "we do think class 
size is important and it's one of the conditions that makes Oak Park fairly 
unique." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise in Simi Valley, the Simi Educators' Assn. has traditionally accepted 
lower salaries for its members on the condition that classes stay relatively 
small. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley teachers have a base starting salary of $23,010 -- which is the 
fifth lowest in the county. But classes at all of Simi Valley's schools are on 
average smaller than in other county districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The board's priority and also the union's priority is not to have the highest 
salaries in the county, but to have low class sizes," said Simi Valley 
Assistant Supt. Leon Mattingley. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simi Valley teachers' priorities may be changing. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Educators Assn. President Ron Myren said the union may consider agreeing 
to increase class size when it begins contract negotiations in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not 100% sure that all the teachers are worried about class size," Myren 
said. "I think they'd like to see a little more money in their pocketbooks. We 
haven't had a raise now in two, maybe three years and a lot of our teachers are 
becoming really strapped." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in those districts that have boosted class size to raise teachers' pay, 
salaries have over the past several years remained relatively stagnant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oxnard Federation of Teachers, for example, wrangled a 3.4% raise from 
their district last year. But that was their first salary boost in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County teachers in general are teaching bigger classes for only 
slightly more pay, statistics on salary and class size show. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, school officials say, is that it is expensive to keep class sizes 
down or to lower them even further. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Hueneme district, the teachers union -- the Hueneme Education Assn. -- 
estimates that it would cost $120,000 per year to lower the average class size 
in the district by one student. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only do school districts have to hire more teachers to get smaller 
classes, but many also have to build new classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Unable to afford this expense but under pressure from its union to keep 
classes small, Hueneme has for years paid bonuses to teachers whose classes 
exceed the maximum in their district contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Last school year, the district paid $115,000 in bonuses -- one kindergarten 
teacher having received $1,900 for an overload of students. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the size of such bonuses, Hueneme Assistant Supt. Yolanda Benitez said 
they are much less costly than adding new teachers to the payroll. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bonuses are one-time expenditures," she said, but hiring teachers is a 
long-term investment. Hueneme officials would prefer smaller classes, Benitez 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is if we had class sizes of 15-to-1, every child would 
succeed," she said. "But we don't have money to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 With California's state budget crisis continuing, officials say it is 
difficult to predict when state education funding will increase enough to keep 
up with rising costs. In the meantime, teachers' union officials said they 
believe school districts in Ventura County and across the state must begin to 
find other ways to cut budgets or boost revenues than to continue to increase 
the size of classes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a limit," California Teachers Assn. spokesman Jan Anderson said. 
"Classrooms will only hold so many kids. I think we really have just about 
reached the limit." Teachers' Salaries in Ventura County 
</P>
<P>
 Salaries at all levels include any extra pay given for length of service. For 
salaries shown for the 15th and 30th years of service, some districts require 
teachers to have master's degrees. Teachers without master's degrees would 
receive less money. None of the salaries shown include stipends for doctorates.

</P>
<P>
 Ventura County schools have classes as big or bigger than the state average. 
And at most county schools, classes have increased in size over the past five 
years. The following average class sizes, shown from biggest to smallest, were 
compiled by the state Department of Education. But local school officials say 
many classes are actually much larger.

 It's the time of year, deep in the unforgiving heat of August, for sticky pink

narrow pens, for barkers enticing passersby to spend a quarter on the ring 
toss, a dollar on the dart throw.

 The Ventura County Fair is coming to town Wednesday, bringing a few changes, 
but mostly the same as it's always been, give or take a few exhibits and 
contests. 
</P>
<P>
 In a day of high tech and high speed, Ventura County's annual fair satisfies 
patrons by staying close to the roots and traditions that created it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The changes we've made reflect the polishing of the program," said Teri 
Raley, who with her husband, Devlin, manages publicity for the fair each year. 
"I think the public wants to preserve the fair with its traditional family 
focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Like last year, fair admission will be $6 for adults, $3 for those 55 and 
older and children 6 to 12 years old, and free for children under 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Minor though they are, changes in the fair schedule will cause some flutter 
among visitors, Raley said. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Metrolink will expand its weekend schedule between Simi Valley 
and the fairgrounds, allowing rail commuters to stay even longer at the 
festivities. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiesta Day, the Latin American-themed day that also commands the fair's 
highest daily attendance, has been rescheduled from the last day of the fair to 
Aug. 21, the fair's first Sunday, to better showcase it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We moved it to earlier in the fair because it's not a P.S.," Raley said. 
"It's a wonderful cultural part of the fair." 
</P>
<P>
 And if the move boosts overall fair attendance by enticing Fiesta Day visitors 
back before the fair closes down, that will be another plus, she said.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the fair beauty pageant is now planned for opening day instead of 
before the fair starts. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair will also feature three new contests: a shaving cream hat contest, a 
Hacky Sack contest and a stick horse contest. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid crowds, fair officials advise attending on weekdays that are not 
special theme days. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, the theme days are Salute to the Military on Thursday (military 
personnel and their families admitted free), Youth Day on Friday (children 12 
and under admitted free), and Seniors and Persons with Disabilities Day on Aug. 
23 (visitors 55 and older and disabled people admitted free). 
</P>
<P>
 What really stirs people up, Raley said, is when they march over to a building 
to view their favorite exhibit, and it's been switched to another facility. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, among other switches, the photography exhibit will move from the 
Gem and Minerals Building to the McBride Building, where other fine arts are 
displayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people will be shaken up by that," Raley said. "But then they'll get 
to the McBride Building, and they will see it in a whole different light." 
</P>
<P>
 The innovation stirring some of the most curiosity this year is the fair's 
theme for 1994: "California Country." 
</P>
<P>
 California Country? 
</P>
<P>
 Few seem to know quite what to make of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I interpret California Country is this concept of a very nice, 
relaxed, country atmosphere," said Steve Rubenstein, president of the Conejo 
Valley Chamber of Commerce, who is scratching his head over the phrase. "But 
knowing the area, it kind of confuses me. (The fairgrounds are) right next to 
the beach. What kind of country is that?" 
</P>
<P>
 Debby Pond, who displays the official fair poster on the window of her Ventura 
cellular phone store, also grasped to define the slogan. 
</P>
<P>
 "California Country," she mused. "Well, when you think of California, you 
think of free and easy and ocean. So the fair would be California Country? See, 
I don't know. I don't know what you get out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "California-Country-by-the-Sea, or something maybe like that?" 
</P>
<P>
 The confusion excites fair officials, who say the new theme is meant to 
stretch people's minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's one of the most delightful thing about this year's theme -- it 
makes you think," said Devlin Raley. "That's what the fair is about -- 
individual expression." 
</P>
<P>
 Devlin Raley works with the fair's board of directors every year to plan the 
event and concoct a slogan worthy of the spinning Ferris wheel and crowing 
roosters. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, he said, the committee was struck by the variety of life in 
California, not to mention in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life within Ventura County is diverse, very traditional, and yet very modern 
and upscale," he said. "And that gives a whole new meaning to the word country 
. 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, what kind of country is it?" he said. "It's California Country!" Fair

CONCERN FOR LAZARUS THE ABUSED DOG KEEPS RISING; ANIMALS: THE ROTTWEILER MIX 
HAS RECOVERED AFTER BEING BOUND AND LEFT TO DIE. BUT PUBLIC RESPONSE CONTINUES, 
WITH OFFERS OF AID AND EVEN VENGEANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 People are loopy over Lazarus. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazarus is the 90-pound pooch -- a Rottweiler mix -- who was left to die in a 
plastic bag in a shopping-center garbage bin a month ago, his legs and snout 
bound with duct tape. His rescue by a security guard made headlines, and 
Lazarus now lives happily with another guard in Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But like the biblical Lazarus, raised from the dead, the hubbub over Lazarus 
the dog will not die. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the Montgomery Ward store near where the dog was found, mysterious 
flyers keep popping up, offering a reward for clues to a canine-cruelty case 
that Santa Ana police have given up on. Hardly a day goes by when someone 
doesn't call or visit the store with offers of money or dog food -- or to break 
the legs of the unknown culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 The most personal display of Lazarus-mania may belong to the security guard 
who found Lazarus, colleagues said: the dog's image and name reportedly are 
tattooed across his upper arm. (The guard could not be reached for comment.) 
</P>
<P>
 The police also have received a steady flow of calls from people who have 
tracked the case, well, doggedly. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's affected a lot of people in a lot of ways," said Karen Carlson, a 
receiving clerk at the store. "It's very weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Caren Evans, a 30-year-old store manager who named Lazarus and first adopted 
him, has been besieged by more than 200 phone calls -- including warm praise, 
promises of help and one marriage proposal -- and the well-meaning visitors who 
keep showing up. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the animal psychologist who offered a couch session -- for the dog -- 
and the man who showed up with an oversized hollowed-out Bible containing a big 
knife -- to use on the culprit. A La Habra woman sent Evans a signed blank 
check. (Evans said she sent it back.) And someone keeps throwing big bags of 
dog food over the patio fence of her Anaheim apartment, though Lazarus moved 
out when the landlord outlawed big dogs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get people every day -- that's why I stopped wearing my name badge," 
sighed a weary Evans, slouched on a couch in the store's furniture section. "We 
get some way-out people. And some very nice people." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of those in the latter category have given money to the Grand Pet Care 
Center to help cover the $600 cost of treating Lazarus, found badly beaten and 
scarred with cigarette burns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an animal lover, and I'm absolutely appalled at whoever did it," said 
Janice Rogers, a retired nurse in Garden Grove who has called Evans and plans 
to send her at least $50. "There should be a 'no-strike' law. They should just 
put them away." 
</P>
<P>
 Police investigators, who have no witnesses or fingerprints from the duct tape 
or plastic bag, have hit a dead end on the case, said John Riles, a supervisor 
in the department's animal-control unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Riles has seen worse animal cruelty, but the brutality of Lazarus' case struck 
a nerve. "A lot of people are interested," he said. "We've never had any live 
animals found bound and gagged and put in a bag and thrown in a trash bin." 
</P>
<P>
 Police are equally baffled over the source of reward posters that list only a 
Police Department phone number. The latest posters cropped up just last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlson said would-be sleuths have called the store seeking surveillance 
tapes. And one woman pledged her every waking hour to solve the crime using 
psychic powers. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the man with the Bible knife and the talk of vengeance, Evans said 
thanks, but no thanks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said why don't you keep it. I'll call you," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Lazarus? 
</P>
<P>
 "Just great," said new owner Greg Roberts, a Montgomery Ward guard who took 
the pooch home to Long Beach when Evans could no longer keep him. The big pup, 
not yet a year old, is almost fully healed, save for a burned patch on his back 
that may never grow back. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a wonderful dog," said Roberts. "No signs that he's been through what 
he's been through."

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
'PORK' IN ANTI-CRIME BILL IS TOO MUCH TO SWALLOW FOR LOCAL LAWMAKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did inaction speak louder than words?: The conservative Orange County 
congressional delegation would win the prize on any given day for its 
anti-crime rhetoric. But the local congressmen -- Rep. Christopher Cox 
(R-Newport Beach), Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), Rep. Jay C. Kim 
(R-Diamond Bar), Rep. Ron Packard (R-Carlsbad), Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach), and Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) -- voted last week to 
block a final House vote on a $33-billion anti-crime bill. Royce supported the 
package last spring when it was first approved by the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans contended that there was too much "pork" and not enough money for 
prisons. (The bill included $10.5 billion for prisons and $7.6 billion for 
crime-prevention programs. But it also contained a controversial ban on 
assault-style firearms). 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people would be delighted (with the bill) if we just took out the $9 
billion in pork," Cox said, says that Republicans really want to vote for a 
crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 There was an irony in Dornan's vote. He called the legislation a "remarkable 
travesty," even though it included his proposal for a Police Corps -- a program 
he has sought since 1989 -- which would provide a four-year college education 
in return for four years of service on a state or local police force. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic response: Some of the local Democrats challenging the incumbent 
Republican congressmen wasted no time in criticizing the vote against the crime 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 * Royce's challenger in the 39th Congressional District, R.O. Davis of Buena 
Park, said Royce "flip-flopped," adding: "The American people are tired of 
being flimflammed. The safety of our citizens is a paramount duty of 
government." 
</P>
<P>
 * In the 41st Congressional District, Kim's challenger, Ed Tessier of Pomona, 
said: "Rep. Kim has put his personal popularity with Washington bigwigs and his 
own political future above the safety and protection of his constituents" by 
following the Republican leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mike Farber of Santa Ana, who is trying to unseat Dornan in the 46th 
Congressional District, called the vote "the latest example of (Dornan's) 
dismal record on crime and law enforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 * Gary Kingsbury of Irvine, who is running in the 47th Congressional District 
against Cox, said: "While our constituents scream for more controls on 
criminals and to make our neighborhoods, homes, and schools safe, Chris Cox 
voted against the crime bill in Congress and with his National Rifle Assn. 
supporters." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Empty pockets: Beset by personal financial problems, a costly divorce and 
legal disputes, Orange County political consultant Harvey A. Englander 
voluntarily filed for bankruptcy last week. Englander, who faces debts of up to 
$900,000, sought protection under Chapter 7 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code, which 
provides for liquidation of his assets to pay back his creditors as much as 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Englander's consulting firm, The Englander Group, is still in business after 
recently merging with The Kamber Group, a large Washington-based public 
relations firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Like Mark Twain said, the rumors of my demise have been greatly exaggerated. 
I'm still here and greatly active," Englander said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Surf's not up: When election time rolls around, politicians go to great 
lengths to find a photogenic prop that hits home with voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), who wants to become the 
state's next attorney general. For an invitation to his "Beach Bash" at Monarch 
Bay Club Thursday at 6 p.m., Umberg -- who normally isn't caught dead without a 
necktie -- posed in front of the Huntington Beach Pier in a wet suit, 
neon-colored sunglasses and holding a surfboard. 
</P>
<P>
 Before we all start calling Umberg a gnarly, tubular politician, let's face 
the facts -- this dude doesn't surf. George Urch, Umberg's campaign manager, 
explains that the candidate's staff borrowed the board and wet suit from a 
Huntington Beach surf shop just for the photo. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not now nor would I ever claim he's a professional surfer," Urch said 
with a chuckle, adding that a staffer had to urge Umberg to take off his 
wingtips for the photo. "We're trying to loosen him up a little." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Rappin' Marian: State Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) is known for her 
ability to rap a bill through the Legislature, not for rap music. But the 
lawmaker and three other Senate colleagues dressed up last week in gangster 
attire, including backward baseball caps and sunglasses, and belted out a tune 
in honor of retiring Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), the former top 
Democrat in the Senate. The normally demure Bergeson joined Sens. Diane Watson 
(D-Los Angeles), Lucy Killea (I-San Diego) and Teresa Hughes (D-Inglewood). 
Calling themselves "Dames Under the Dome," they performed imitation rap music. 
A sample: "David talked the right thing. David did the right thing./Whatta man, 
whatta man, whatta man. Oooooo, Ahaah." MTV isn't calling. UPCOMING EVENTS 
</P>
<P>
 Monday: Republican U.S. Senate candidate Mike Huffington speaks to the Orange 
County Republican Central Committee meeting at 7 p.m. at the Westin South Coast 
Plaza hotel in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday: Friends of Gil Ferguson committee holds a fund-raising dinner with 
the "Phantom of the Opera" at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa

FIRE DESTROYS ARCO TOWERS MACHINERY ROOM; BLAZE: FORTY TO 50 WORKERS ARE 
EVACUATED FROM DOWNTOWN HIGH-RISE. FLAMES ARE EXTINGUISHED IN ABOUT 45 MINUTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A fire destroyed a machinery room Saturday in the 52-story Arco Towers, 
forcing dozens of weekend workers to be evacuated from the Downtown high-rise. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 firefighters put the late afternoon blaze out within 45 
minutes.No injuries were reported. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it had gotten beyond the (machinery) room, it could have been very 
serious," said Alan Schroeder, the Fire Department's incident commander. 
</P>
<P>
 The room was on a mezzanine area between the 38th and 39th floors. "The room 
burned up," Schroeder said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he did not know the nature of the machinery. No damage estimate was 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 Some firefighters speculated that the blaze may have been due to an electrical 
malfunction, but officially the cause remains under investigation. 
</P>

 Firefighters, responding to a smoke alarm at 4:15 p.m., discovered flames 
coming from the machinery room when they inspected the building, said Los 
Angeles Fire Department spokesman Brian Humphrey. No flames or smoke were 
visible from the outside, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 40 to 50 people working in the building were evacuated after security 
officers issued a warning.  
</P>
<P>
 Employees at the accounting firm of Ernst & Young on the 23rd floor said they 
smelled smoke as they made their way down a stairwell.

 "My legs are wobbly," Judi Ward, a controller, said as she stood outside the 
building. "You really get the sense that you want to get out of there, hearing 
some of the tales of other buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was in the northernmost of Arco's two towers at 515 S. Flower St.

CAMPAIGN '94: ISSUES AND ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three candidates are running in the Nov. 8 election to represent the 48th 
Congressional District. They are Democrat Andrei Leschick of Valley Center, 
Peace and Freedom candidate Donna White of San Diego and Republican Ron 
Packard, the incumbent, of Carlsbad. Health Care 
</P>
<P>
 Leschick: "I support universal national health insurance, providing consumers 
a full choice between private providers, financed by a broad-based national 
sales tax, incorporating cost controls through competition, malpractice law 
reform, reduction of red tape, and stiff penalties to prevent fraud and abuse. 
. . . (I support) a system that includes reasonable co-payments for certain 
services to discourage abuse and to encourage proper individual health 
maintenance. I also support standardized forms to reduce the cost of paperwork, 
which now represents 25% of the total cost of health care in America. . . . I 
oppose using employer mandates to finance health care because they drive up the 
cost of American labor, reduce employment and create bureaucracies. . . . (A 
national sales tax to finance health care) is fair and efficient because it 
will encourage savings and investment and because it will apply to services and 
imports as well as American-made products." 
</P>
<P>
 White: Did not respond. 
</P>
<P>
 Packard: "As a former health-care provider, I am anxious to contribute my 
ideas to the debate about health care reform. I do not support the 
Clinton-Mitchell-Gephardt approaches to turning one-seventh of our economy over 
to the federal government. One only needs to examine the programs already 
administered by the federal government -- Medicare, Medicaid and welfare -- to 
know that waste, fraud, abuse and escalating costs would replace the efficient 
market-driven industry we now enjoy in America. I support the reform embodied 
in the Republicans' health care reform bill. . . . It expands access while 
preserving choice and containing costs. It does so without new taxes, 
government price controls, or complex bureaucracies. It also prohibits 
insurance companies from refusing coverage for people who switch jobs and 
allows Americans the luxury of choosing their own family doctor; (it keeps) 
intact the patient-doctor relationship that the Clinton-Mitchell-Gephardt plans 
would destroy." Education and Health Care Benefits for Illegal Immigrants 
</P>
<P>
 Leschick: "I strongly support the efforts of the states and municipalities to 
seek federal financial assistance for immigrant education and social service 
expenses. All of America enjoys the benefits immigrants provide to our work 
force and culture; all of America should pay the costs. I also support efforts 
to create and strictly enforce fair and reasonable laws affecting immigrants 
and guest workers and protect civil rights, including the establishment of a 
tamper-proof North American identification card, a modern expanded guest-worker 
program and the creation of a guest-worker tax and insurance account to pay for 
their health and social service expenses. I oppose proposals that would deny 
education and health care services to any children living in the U.S. both 
because of the dangerous and expensive impact to public safety and because 
these proposals are contrary to fundamental American principles and long-term 
national interests." 
</P>
<P>
 White: Did not respond 
</P>
<P>
 Packard: "I favor ending taxpayer-financed benefits for illegal aliens. An 
amendment I authored was passed as part of the earthquake disaster bill in 
January. My amendment excluded illegal aliens from receiving long-term disaster 
assistance, with the exception of emergency medical care. . . . Providing 
benefits to those who break the law to enter this country undermines our laws 
and acts as a magnet, attracting thousands across our borders to take advantage 
of free health, education and welfare. Americans are tired of feeding more and 
more of their hard-earned dollars to support those who have broken our laws to 
come into this country. Shouldn't the government make every effort to identify 
illegal immigrants and exclude them from receiving benefits? You bet it should. 
But most Americans would be appalled to know that federal agencies make no 
attempt to identify a person's legal status. It is absolute hypocrisy that we 
forbid employers under penalty of law to hire illegal immigrants, while at the 
same time our federal agencies that dispense benefits are not required to even 
make an attempt to determine a person's legal status. I intend to end this 
practice." Crime 
</P>
<P>
 Leschick: Platform includes support of "truth-in-sentencing" laws, boot camps 
for juvenile offenders and work programs "to make criminals pay back their debt 
to society and to their victims." It supports community policing to include 
crime prevention, substance abuse and after-school programs and "values-based" 
education to teach ethics and respect of the law. "I strongly support a 'three 
strikes' law, which would assure incorrigible and dangerous felons remain 
behind bars. However, the current California law as written may inadvertently 
apply to non-dangerous felons whose incarceration costs may divert funds from 
truly dangerous criminals and result in increased costs and taxes. . . . The 
biggest crime problem facing Southern California and America today is 
unemployment. . . . Building a new economy, creating constructive jobs, putting 
people to work is the most essential and cost-effective solution to crime in 
America." 
</P>
<P>
 White: Did not respond 
</P>
<P>
 Packard: "There are many reasons to oppose the $33-billion crime bill now 
before Congress. However, one provision points to the very core of the crime 
problem and why the Democratic Party leaders controlling our government are 
incapable of dealing with the crime problem. The bill denies us the right to 
fill the very spiritual void that is responsible for our crime crisis. It makes 
it virtually impossible to impart to our young people such basic values as the 
Ten Commandments. The $630-million Family and Community Endeavor schools grant 
program, more commonly known as FACE, funds crime-prevention programs designed 
to reach the most vulnerable members of our communities -- our kids. The bill's 
language states that none of the money may be used for religious worship or 
instruction. This means teaching kids the Ten Commandments is prohibited. . . . 
Our children need to understand that values are important, respect for others 
is paramount and community participation is vital (as well as) being 
responsible for and accountable for your actions. . . . If we fail to teach 
these lessons, we doom the future of this country to the fatal grip of 
lawlessness and violence -- anarchy." El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
</P>
<P>
 Leschick: "My plan helps us protect our national security by preserving our 
defense industrial capability while at the same time utilizing it to produce a 
clean, fast and efficient high-speed ground transport system for Southern 
California based on magnetic levitation (maglev) train technology, integrated 
with automated people-movers and electric station cars. . . . I oppose creation 
of a commercial airport at El Toro because there is a better alternative, in 
terms of both community environmental impact (and) economic impact and job 
creation. Rather than construct new airports, Southern California needs an 
integrated high-speed ground transportation network which puts an international 
airport -- without runways, noise, or potential crashes -- conveniently close 
to every community. To create the city of the future for developers and 
residents, El Toro should be utilized as a maglev station: check your bags, get 
your boarding pass, catch your first flight -- 250 m.p.h. "magnetic flight" to 
the runway -- aboard a maglev USA system designed and produced in Southern 
California." 
</P>
<P>
 White: Did not respond 
</P>
<P>
 Packard: "I oppose the development of an international airport at El Toro. I 
have studied and participated in the planning and implementation of 
transportation and aviation projects during my service in Congress. I am 
convinced that in the long term, an airport that must be built to truly serve 
Southern California's needs will not be at El Toro. Southern California will 
not have four small, regional airports; one for Los Angeles County, another for 
Orange County, another for San Diego County and still another for the Inland 
Empire. The planning process must seek to find a site for an airport to serve 
all of Southern California. Converting El Toro does not solve any of the 
problems we are already struggling with at John Wayne Airport or (San Diego's) 
Lindbergh Field."

2ND ARREST MADE IN ALLEGED RACIAL ATTACK ON TEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 20-year-old Huntington Beach man was arrested on suspicion of attempted 
murder early Saturday in connection with the Aug. 4 attack on a black Santa 
Margarita High School student, an incident that is being investigated as a 
possible hate crime, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Thomas Jones was arrested about 1:15 a.m. in the 25000 block of Sawmill 
Lane in Lake Forest, said Lt. William Francis of the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department.A 16-year-old Lake Forest boy, who was not identified because of his 
age, was arrested shortly after the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said additional arrests are expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, 15-year-old Ruben Charles Vaughn of Tustin, was beaten and stabbed 
with an unknown weapon when he and a friend arrived at a party in Portola Hills 
Aug. 4. A racial slur was reportedly shouted during the attack, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn's friend, a 16-year-old Lake Forest boy who is white, was also punched 
and sprayed with a chemical, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn's stepfather, Melvin Aaron, has charged that his son was lured to the 
party, isolated from the group and singled out as a target. He said Vaughn, a 
standout football player who cracked the starting lineup last year as a 
freshman, was involved in three verbal and physical incidents at the school in 
which race was a factor.

OCEAN DROWNING VICTIM IDENTIFIED AS ALASKA RESIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 47-year-old man who drowned in the ocean near Dana Point Harbor was 
identified Saturday as Ronald Petros of Anchorage, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Petros was swimming about 30 yards off a rock jetty near the harbor with his 
18- and 15-year-old sons about 3 p.m. Friday, when the trio became caught in a 
riptide, said an Orange County Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 A 911 call from a witness sent a Dana Point Harbor Patrol launch to the area 
and all three swimmers were rescued, but Petros was later declared dead at a 
local hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Petros had been visiting relatives in Laguna Hills with his wife and children, 
according to a spokesman at the Orange County coroner's office.

LAND SWAP PROPOSAL LEAVES AIRPORT UP IN THE AIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I appreciate The Times giving me credit for having originated the idea of a 
land swap between the Irvine Co. and the federal government to expedite 
conversion of the Marine Base at El Toro from military to civilian uses. But I 
want to correct the Times story. What I proposed some months ago was more than 
"slightly different" from the Irvine Co./Department of the Interior plan that 
surfaced last week. 
</P>
<P>
 The land swap I've been advocating includes thousands of acres of Irvine Co. 
agricultural lands surrounding the Marine Base and an essential additional 
requirement: In exchange for broad development rights at the base, my proposal 
would obligate the Irvine Co. to build a modern "railport" centered in Irvine 
and El Toro, not a commercial airport. In fact, commercial air use of El Toro 
would be expressly and forever prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, the potential land swap deal so widely reported last week lacks 
this essential guarantee. Accordingly, it's left to the citizens of Orange 
County to effectively rule out a commercial airport at El Toro by voting "no" 
on the El Toro Airport Initiative, which appears on the Nov. 8 ballot. By 
saying no, voters will also be saying no to tumbling residential property 
values and to billions of dollars in new bonded indebtedness. 
</P>
<P>
 LARRY AGRAN 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * James L. Doti paints a wonderful picture (Why an Airport at El Toro Is So 
Critical," Aug. 11), but it neglects so many issues. Nearly every other airport 
in this country was developed away from prime residential property; the one 
exception that comes to mind is John Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 Politics is the only way airport proponents have a chance to override South 
Countians. How did El Toro get on the closure list to begin with? It met none 
of the critical closure criteria. Now there is a proposed, but highly 
irregular, "land- swap deal" between the Department of the Interior, the 
Department of Defense and the private Irvine Co. Are the proponents going to 
belly up to the proverbial bar and make compensation to South Countians for 
multibillion-dollar loss in their residential values and quality of life? 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * What Orange County needs is a railport and a busport, but definitely not 
another airport! 
</P>
<P>
 What the Irvine Co. must pledge if a land swap is to be supported by the 
people of Orange County is: definitely not another airport! 
</P>

<P>
 * It doesn't surprise me one bit that Jim Doti (president and professor of 
economics at Chapman University) believes an airport at El Toro critical. How 
can he possibly say that as a professor he's reticent about supporting 
something as controversial as El Toro airport when he cannot deny that the 
mighty developer himself, George Argyros, contributes a good amount of money to 
the university? 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Doti is no expert in aviation. It is going to cost far more money than we 
think just to try to convert this military base into an airport for 
commercial/civilian use. You can just bet that we as taxpayers will end up 
footing the bill! Do these financial experts think that these jobs if El Toro 
is converted into an airport are just going to pop up in a few short years? 
Untrue! 
</P>
<P>
 El Toro is only critical to self-serving developers who have huge financial 
gains to make on this deal. Why do we have to assume that an airport is the 
only thing that can make Orange County's future strong? There are many other 
money-generating things to do with the base (too numerous for me to name) that 
will be good for everyone. In 1988/89 the Airport Site Consensus group did a 
report covering potential airport sites: Out of 21, El Toro finished 14th! I 
hardly call finishing 14th a top contender for an airport!

 * The land trade of environmentally sensitive land near the Cleveland National 
Forest owned by the Irvine Co. for land at the El Toro Marine base is exciting 
news. However, the idea of trading excess federal lands for sensitive habitat 
is not new. The Bolsa Chica Land Trust, with support from the U.S. Fish and 
Wildlife Service, has been working on the same idea as a way to save Bolsa 
Chica from the development of 4,884 homes while still allowing the landowners a 
return on their investments. 
</P>
<P>
 By trading excess federal land from military base closures or other sources, 
the Fish and Wildlife Service could acquire Bolsa Chica, and the current 
landowners could receive a fair return on their investment. We at the Land 
Trust are confident that the landowners at Bolsa Chica will soon follow the 
lead of the Irvine Co. and realize a land swap is a win-win solution for all 
parties involved.

 * I wonder if the Irvine Co., which has worked hard to portray itself as a 
"good neighbor" to the city of Irvine, will, if successful in its land swap 
endeavor, turn around and sell a portion of the El Toro base to the county of 
Orange, which will in turn proceed with building an airport? 
</P>
<P>
 This would enable the Irvine Co. to maintain the good-neighbor facade by not 
endorsing the airport project directly, but benefiting immensely by its 
proximity to their vast Irvine Spectrum complex. 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly gives one pause for thought. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * The trade proposed is definitely laudable, but what is really needed is a 
land swap that would save the agricultural land surrounding the El Toro Marine 
base. 
</P>
<P>
 Doesn't South Orange County now have a need to propose its own land swap? Why 
not recommend a land trade involving swapping land at the El Toro base for land 
in Laguna Canyon presently owned by the Irvine Co.? 
</P>
<P>
 Why not take this opportunity to rescue from development all agricultural 
lands in Laguna Canyon not yet preserved? The goal behind this canyon land swap 
would be to save intact the most beautiful, pristine and accessible coastal 
canyon -- very few remain in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 JEAN JENKS 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * After reading of the latest player's entry into the El Toro Marine base 
reuse controversy, the big question now becomes, can the federal government be 
hoodwinked as easily as the city of Irvine? Unfortunately this scenario may 
come to pass if the Irvine Co. gets its way. 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago the Irvine Co. spent close to a million dollars in an 
election campaign to convince the voters of Irvine to support a ballot measure 
dedicating Irvine Co. land as "open space" to the city. The stipulation was 
that in return they be allowed to proceed building a massive, high-density 
residential development in the center of Irvine in an area now known as 
Westpark. The voters, naturally eager to preserve land as open space forever, 
gave their nod of approval, thinking they had made a great deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Regrettably, what voters were unaware of at the time was that in return for 
allowing significantly higher building density within the city's boundaries, 
the Irvine Co. magnanimously exchanged unbuildable land outside the city limits 
that can only be reached by those willing to make arrangements in advance, have 
a guide and undertake a strenuous hike of about 10 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Will history repeat itself now that the Irvine Co. has initiated discussions 
regarding a land swap? For Donald Bren, president of the Irvine Co., the 
exchange of extremely valuable property sitting smack-dab in the middle of 
Orange County for land which because of its sensitive nature will probably 
never be developed is a very shrewd maneuver indeed -- and obviously not the 
first time he's used this ploy. 
</P>
<P>
 MERYL SCHWARTZ 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 * County Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder's comments ("Is End to O.C. Base Issue 
Near or Is This Just Another Twist?" Aug 7) that the land exchange issue should 
be taken as a "vote of no confidence to the El Toro Reuse Planning Authority" 
may be correct. I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 What's interesting to me is that Wieder sings a different tune with regard to 
the Bolsa Chica ecosystem. In Huntington Beach a majority of the people, as 
well as the City Council, have expressed a "vote of no confidence" in Wieder's 
"coalition for the Bolsa Chica." 
</P>
<P>
 Many citizen groups have expressed a desire to have part of the El Toro base 
used for a land swap to save the precious Bolsa Chica, but she insists it's not 
practical. She and Supervisor Roger R. Stanton are willing to have a small city 
be created (5,000 homes) on unincorporated land, against the wishes of 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Funny how human nature lets us see two similar situations so differently, 
isn't it?

INESCAPABLE CONCERNS; POROUS LANCASTER STATE PRISON STILL DOESN'T HAVE A WARDEN 
TO CALL ITS OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tired of California's high unemployment rate (it's up to 9%) and Los Angeles 
County's even more anemic showing, at 10%? Perhaps you could consider a career 
in corrections. Specifically, we're talking about the job of prison warden. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, there's something of a shortage of these folks. That's the 
impression we get from the ongoing game of musical chairs at the most porous 
maximum-security prison in the state in recent memory: California State 
Prison-Los Angeles County, in Lancaster. It's the only one to have had escapes 
by dangerous inmates this year and last year. 
</P>
<P>
 First, John Ratelle ascended to the warden's chair in February, replacing the 
fellow in charge during both of those escapes, Otis Thurman. Security was 
tightened during the Ratelle regime and no escapes were recorded, but we 
weren't exactly pleased to hear that Ratelle was still serving as warden of a 
state prison in San Diego at the time, and traveling back there on weekends. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratelle is now out. He has been replaced, also on an interim basis, by Donald 
R. Hill. But it turns out that Hill has a divided attention span as well and is 
still serving as warden of the California Correctional Institution at 
Tehachapi. Sure, an assistant is running day-to-day operations at Tehachapi, 
but Hill is the top dog there and would be called during any disturbance. 
</P>
<P>
 What gives? Isn't there some kind of minor league for prison wardens? Aren't 
there credible assistant or deputy wardens out there, and why is it taking so 
long to find one? 
</P>
<P>
 It helps that there have been no escapes from Lancaster since January. The 
surrounding community, however, needs the additional reassurance of knowing 
that the place is being run on a permanent, full-time basis by a warden whose 
attentions won't be diverted to another prison in some other part of the state. 
Lancaster needs its own warden, and soon.

SUPPORT RULE CHANGE ON HELICOPTER NOISE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The recent spectacle over the Los Angeles freeways during the O.J. Simpson 
chase involved dozens of low-flying media helicopters that interfered with the 
police and endangered the public. It is abundantly clear that additional 
measures must be taken by the Federal Aviation Administration to address the 
problem of low-flying helicopter noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners of Encino filed a rule change with the FAA regarding low-flying 
helicopters, which was published in the Federal Register on June 27. If 
approved by the FAA, the rule change would require helicopters to follow the 
same minimum altitude of 1,000 feet above ground level over populated areas as 
fixed-wing aircraft. It would exempt police, fire and other emergency 
helicopter activities. 
</P>
<P>
 If the helicopter noise problem is to be controlled, then residents must write 
letters to the FAA in support of this rule change. Elected officials and the 
public have only until Aug. 25 to send in comments, in triplicate, to the FAA 
in Washington before it makes a determination.

COMPANIES PROFIT BY ABUSING TEMP WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The hiring of temporary workers is a recognized new and growing trend 
("Companies Reaping Savings with Temporary Workers," July 26). Inequities 
abound.For example, consider my wife's case history: 
</P>
<P>
 Her permanent employment as an accountant evaporated with the aerospace and 
defense industries. Presently she can only obtain temporary work. Because of 
her education (two certificates, master's degree) and her experience (20 years 
as an accounting supervisor), assignments are frequent. However, hourly wages 
are only about two-thirds of former years, and unpaid intervals occur between 
assignments. Furthermore, fringe benefits such as medical coverage are totally 
absent. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent assignment, the permanent accountant of the company had made a 
mess of the financial records. Information and money was lost or misplaced, and 
statements didn't balance. Furthermore, neither the accountant nor her clerks 
knew how to fully operate the computer. My wife straightened out three months 
of this backlog and made the software operative in four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 My wife was hired after three other temps had been let go, apparently because 
they couldn't correct a nearly impossible situation. A carrot held out to 
attract my wife was the offer of a possible well-paying permanent job. No offer 
was ever made, and the job ended after all the financial records were fixed.  
</P>
<P>
 This story may serve as an example of some of the abuse being suffered by 
capable workers. White-collar employees are now in the same boat with temporary 
farm workers. With employee expenses down, you can be sure that corporation 
profits are up. Stockholders and executives are becoming wealthier. Huge 
numbers of employees such as my wife are not.

ASK SENIOR CITIZENS WHERE THEY WANT TO LIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * After reading of the plan to house senior citizens above retail stores along 
Ventura Boulevard, I would like to suggest that Councilman Zev Yaraslovsky ask 
the senior citizens if they would like to live in such apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Being a senior with a low or moderate income should not mean that we have to 
be shoved into places that no one else would live in.Richard Close, president 
of the Sherman Oaks Homeowners Assn., is correct in his assumption that the 
people with the highest incomes would not be attracted by such apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 I suggest that the city carefully study the issue to make sure that the senior 
citizens will be interested in the project. Low-income housing will most 
certainly not improve the status of Ventura Boulevard.

KIND STRANGER OFFERS HIS HAND, GIVES INSPIRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Two friends and I were very fortunate on July 24 to survive, relatively 
unscratched, a four-car collision on Highway 126 that left two people dead and 
nine injured. Perhaps as amazing as our survival was the individual we met 
almost afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 My perception of a guardian angel has usually conjured up the image of the 
character Clarence in "It's a Wonderful Life." Joe Venegas is no less of a 
guardian angel. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Noeme, and children were going on an outing to Santa Paula 
and were delayed by the accident. The fact that it took over two hours for us 
to be able to leave the scene did not deter him from offering us assistance in 
any way possible. Not only did Mr. Venegas greatly alleviate our stress. He 
later provided a safe and secure atmosphere for us in his home while we waited 
to be picked up. 
</P>
<P>
 He is an inspiration to me and my friends as we reflect on today's society 
beset with distrust, xenophobia and generalized alienation. It's reassuring to 
know that there are still people out there, like Joe Venegas, who will go out 
of their way to help a stranger.

SOME CONSTITUENTS NOT MOVED BY BUCK MCKEON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your glowing feature on Rep. Howard (Buck) McKeon of California's 25th 
Congressional District failed to express the sentiment of the people whom Mr. 
McKeon represents. We know him not as "Congressman Earthquake," but as someone 
who balked at voting earthquake relief when he saw it as a political 
opportunity to force budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In an area far from immune from violent crime and gangs, we know him as one 
who lent his vote to his biggest campaign contributor (the National Rifle 
Assn.) and voted against the Brady Bill and the assault weapons ban provision 
of the Crime Bill. As an election-year environmentalist, he also opposes the 
Desert Protection Act in favor of his hunting buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 As the article suggested, McKeon is not the person we sent to Congress. He ran 
on a platform that opposed the North American Free Trade Agreement, supported 
campaign reform and advocated term limits -- and reversed his position on all 
three once in office. He has violated the trust of his constituency and has 
emerged as one who bows to special interests. 
</P>
<P>
 If, as your article states, his reelection is expected, it will come without 
the support of many of his district's Republicans and with a strong opposition 
by a growing Democratic Party.

WHY THE SAN FERNANDO VALLEY SHOULD BECOME A CITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Thank you for your article showing how the Valley, if it were its own city, 
would rank against the other metro centers in the country (Aug. 3). 
</P>
<P>
 San Fernando Valley would be a dynamic city, the sixth-largest in America, 
with one of the lowest crime rates among major metropolitan centers. Our 
amenities, commerce and people rival any city in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 So why hasn't there been a recent serious effort to break away from Los 
Angeles? Because under current law it's nearly impossible! 
</P>
<P>
 After citizens go through numerous governmental procedures and a vote by the 
people of the city approving a detachment plan, the Los Angeles City Council 
could still veto the detachment! 
</P>
<P>
 That is why I have authored AB 3370, which would deny the Los Angeles City 
Council power over an election already decided by the people. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly Local Government Committee will be holding a hearing in the San 
Fernando Valley this fall to take testimony on this important issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is, for over two decades, the people of the Valley have been 
struggling with City Hall to receive their fair share of government services. 
Though it's nice to now have a mayor who knows where the Valley is, the reality 
is the council districts are still unfairly gerrymandered, our police divisions 
are undermanned and we do not receive value for the tax dollars we contribute 
to the city coffers. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe the San Fernando Valley measures up as its own metropolis. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * We Valleyites have a serious case of an inferiority complex. We, who number 
over 1.2 million, and who, if we broke from Los Angeles, would be the fourth or 
fifth most populous city in the country, still kowtow to little West Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Politically we are dictated to by the West L.A. mafia run by Reps. Henry 
Waxman and Howard Berman and City Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, so that our next 
new state senator will be Herschel Rosenthal. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't know the Valley. He doesn't live in the Valley. He doesn't care 
about the Valley. But he doesn't want to lose his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting rid of Rosenthal and his ilk was exactly the reason we, with great 
reluctance, voted for term limits. Having exceeded his term limits for West 
L.A., he is now the Democratic candidate for a large part of our Valley. 
Shouldn't that be illegal? 
</P>
<P>
 In the Valley section of July 28 we find that poor little, rich little West 
L.A. can't find a place to do its recycling, so the 18-wheelers drag their 
recyclable trash over to our Valley to pollute our air. 
</P>
<P>
 The black community thinks of us as bigots though we have a higher proportion 
of ethnic minorities than the basin. The West L.A. community thinks of us as 
bumpkins, without theaters, museums or concert halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's not just a separate school district we in the San Fernando Valley 
need. Maybe we need to be a city independent of Los Angeles.

THE DROP IN CRIME IS A CHANCE FOR CHANGE; IT'S TIME TO UPGRADE LAPD WITH 
EQUIPMENT, OFFICERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There has been a steep drop in crime in the San Fernando Valley so far this 
year, and there have been some small gains by the Los Angeles Police Department 
in terms of technological capability and funds for overtime. All come as 
welcome news in a region struggling to recover from various woes. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact remains, however, that some of the decrease may be as easily 
attributable to the earthquake and its aftermath (criminals can be displaced, 
too) as to new crime-fighting techniques. Moreover, those recent high-tech 
gains mask fundamental weaknesses in terms of equipment and computing options. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, some of the solutions planned for the Valley's worst crime areas must be 
redefined according to restrictions on other capabilities. It's fine, for 
example, to talk of "saturating" problem areas with more patrol officers. But a 
certain amount of context is needed here, such as the fact that the Valley is 
still the most lightly patrolled part of a huge city that itself is one of the 
most lightly patrolled, overall, in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 And while we are pleased to note the availability of additional overtime money 
to put more officers on the street, this is still a poor substitute for the 
permanent deployment of more officers. Officers who have already pulled a shift 
are hardly as alert when they are sent into a high crime area to work several 
more hours on overtime. The long-term goal must be a larger police force. 
</P>
<P>
 The equipment problem is so severe that one shortage serves to exacerbate 
another problem. It was just a couple of weeks ago, for instance, that 
Councilwoman Laura Chick was touring the police academy and came across some 
$270,000 in new equipment for use in local police stations. It was important 
stuff, including interactive technology that will help test and teach officers 
on the appropriate use of force. Unfortunately, it had been gathering dust at 
the academy for nearly a month. Why? Because there were no police vans to 
transport the training equipment to the local police stations. 
</P>
<P>
 At Chick's request, the City Council has approved the purchase of two vans for 
the department. Perhaps it will mean that the training equipment won't be left 
to sit idle for another month before it gets to where its needed. That's just 
one illustration of the department's equipment problems. There are many others. 
</P>
<P>
 We are pleased to note the use, since April, of computers in the LAPD's Gang 
Tracking System. Again, however, it hides the fact that the department still 
lacks a computer network linking its 18 divisions, that detectives still spend 
more than half of their time filling out paperwork by hand, and that many of 
the computers the LAPD does have are cast-offs that are unable to communicate 
with each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Cars are still a big problem. As one high-ranking member of the force has put 
it, "Detectives frequently must wait for an available car to file cases, 
interview suspects or talk with victims and witnesses. Police officers spend 
valuable time putting a broken car out of service and outfitting another car to 
continue their watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps this is the context in which we should view figures that show a 50% 
reduction in homicides, an 18% drop in robberies, an 8% reduction in aggravated 
assaults, and a 6% decline in rapes in the Valley over the first six months of 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a remarkably fortuitous circumstance under these conditions, and perhaps 
the only benefit possible from an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Now is the time to take advantage of the situation, by showing a willingness 
to do what it takes to better equip and expand the LAPD. The last thing we can 
afford is to find such solace in the crime numbers and in piecemeal funding 
solutions that we begin to feel as though the problem of personnel and 
equipment has been solved. It most emphatically has not been solved.

BUS LINE REINSTATEMENT SHOWS CITIZENS CAN WIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I recently wrote an article describing frustration over the termination of 
commuter bus service from the Antelope Valley to Century City and Beverly Hills 
by the Antelope Valley Transit Authority (Valley Commentary, July 24). 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the affected commuters took off work, attended a regularly scheduled 
board meeting July 25 and, armed with a list of riders and other proposals, 
petitioned it to consider reinstating the service to West Los Angeles.The board 
asked AVTA staff to return to the drawing board and report back at a special 
meeting on Aug. 8. In the meantime, a second group of Westsiders met with the 
AVTA executive staff on a Saturday for a true working meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 8, in response to the AVTA staff recommendation, the board of 
directors voted to reinstate the commuter bus service from the Antelope Valley 
to West Los Angeles beginning Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westside commuters appreciate this opportunity to give due praise to the 
members of the AVTA executive staff, the authority's board of directors and to 
transportation staffers Herb Balian and Rosa Fuqua for county Supervisor 
Michael Antonovich.  
</P>
<P>
 These representatives of our local governments listened to the case presented, 
immediately acted on the facts and reversed their earlier decision. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a lesson here. Citizens and government representatives are not 
mutually exclusive. They can work together to produce sound, tangible solutions 
which benefit everyone.

THE L.A. RIVER'S 'NATURAL' HISTORY; UNTIL 1825, THE LOS ANGELES BASIN WAS 
VASTLY DIFFERENT FROM THE CURRENT DESERT. WHAT WAS THE AREA'S ENVIRONMENT IN 
THE DISTANT PAST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CRANDELL, John Crandell of Shadow Hills is a landscape architect and 
vice president of the L.A. Millennium Project. He is at work on a 
place-oriented history of Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In light of proposals to restore the concrete-lined Los Angeles River to its 
"natural" state, plus the recent discovery of fossil bones of an imperial 
mammoth and a saber-toothed cat beneath Hollywood Boulevard, it's instructive 
to reflect on the Los Angeles Basin's distant past. 
</P>
<P>
 How many other such fossils lie below us? What was Los Angeles' environment 
really like "way back when"? How many topomorphic revolutions have been wrought 
here by flood and earthquake since behemoths chewed cud at the Bowl? 
</P>
<P>
 Our ideas of the past are likely to be influenced by the city's 
chaparral-covered backdrop. It's easy to assume that the basin of yesteryear 
was all dust and desolation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the lowlands of the coastal plain were vastly different from what we might 
think. Evidently they were a veritable Garden of Eden during the millennia 
following the last Ice Age, right down till 1825. The earliest human 
inhabitants of the lowlands of the South Coast Basin lived in a verdant complex 
of marsh and forest, not a desert. The L.A. River did not run into the ocean; 
it dispersed into an extensive wetland matrix. 
</P>
<P>
 All that changed overnight in the biggest flood in recorded L.A. history. 
</P>
<P>
 For eons, a constant supply of surface and ground-water sustained a 
superlative matrix of forest and tule in the bottom land of Los Angeles and 
Orange counties. Large areas of giant sycamore, ash, cottonwood and alder were 
interspersed with marshes filled with sedges and bull rushes. The coastal edge 
of the plain was mottled by a string of ancient peat bogs. 
</P>
<P>
 Waters of the Los Angeles, San Gabriel and Santa Ana rivers dispersed 
laterally over the plain. The wintertime runoff leaked through to the Pacific 
at numerous points. Memoirs and histories by John Warner, Benhamin Hayes, 
Joseph Widney and Thomas Talbert make it clear that none of the rivers flowed 
into the ocean until the spring of 1825. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade earlier a 10-day deluge had sent the Los Angeles River bursting out 
of the San Fernando watershed carrying an immense number of fallen trees from 
higher points. As the waters spread out below Elysian Narrows, the interlock of 
drifting branches and forest trunks stopped the boulders rocks and gravel 
flowing with the current. A broad, oval-shaped berm 10 to 15 feet high built 
up, extending about two-thirds of a mile east from the present-day rail yard 
below Chinatown to where the Golden State Freeway crosses Main Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The river immediately shifted toward the southwest. The large Gabrielino 
village called Yang-na lying in its new path was turned to a morass of floating 
wickiups. Bypassing the coastal plain, the river flowed toward the southwest 
into the present Exposition Park area, then west into the forests and marshes 
of the Ballona Creek drainage. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in 1825, a hard rainstorm occurred one spring day at the Los Angeles 
pueblo and broke up in the afternoon. The weather the following day was clear, 
and a full moon illuminated the landscape that night. The river had risen but 
had not given cause for alarm. 
</P>
<P>
 At midnight an immense wall of water poured through the narrows under the 
moonlight and broke through the 10-year-old debris dam. The resultant ground 
shaking and noise awoke the area. Jose Lugo, 12, emerged from his father's 
adobe on San Pedro Road, ran to the west bank of the now-empty river channel 
and watched the flood cutting a new channel along the far eastern side of the 
valley at the edge of the present Boyle Heights. The water cut away the base of 
the slope that defines the heights, and the morning revealed a sparkling white 
bluff of quartz sand and rounded white beach pebbles. It was known afterward as 
Paredon Blanco.  
</P>
<P>
 The 30-plus hours between the rain at the pueblo and the arrival of the flood 
indicates that a storm of biblical proportions had occurred at a high elevation 
and far away. One can postulate that an unfathomable deluge had taken place 
over the upper Big Tujunga Canyon. 
</P>
<P>
 The force of the water that poured through the Elysian Narrows that April 
night was sufficient to cut a river channel through forest and swamp all the 
way south from the Los Angeles Valley to the eastern portion of Rancho 
Dominguez near the present city of Carson. A huge inland lake formed within the 
bottom land area there. When it began to drain into the Pacific, it revealed 
the remains of thousands of animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus was born the "natural" L.A. river as we know it. 
</P>
<P>
 The new outlet to the sea drained the wetlands, and with the loss of the 
accompanying ground-water, the huge lowland forest disappeared in the following 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 The wetlands of Bolsa Chica and Newport are the sole surviving fragments of 
the original matrix, which may have been as large as 300 square miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years after the great flood, Kit Carson and Ewing Young made their first 
expedition into the Los Angeles Basin. The natural beauty was still such that 
Carson henceforth described Los Angeles as "truly a paradise on earth."

PLATFORM; THE LANDFILL NUMBERS: FACT OR FICTION? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The operating permit of the Lopez Canyon Landfill near Lake View Terrace 
expires in 1996, but city sanitation officials have recommended extending its 
life until 2000, saying this would save $72 million in trash-hauling costs.  
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman RICHARD ALARCON is leading the fight on City Council against 
the extension. He told The Times:  
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago the Board of Public Works promised to close the Lopez Canyon 
Landfill in 1996. The promise was written into the City Council's conditions 
for the landfill's permit. Condition No. 6 says the permit will expire in 1996 
"with no further extensions or authorizations." 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Bureau of Sanitation board says closing the dump may be too costly. It 
wants to keep Lopez open just "a little longer." 
</P>
<P>
 My position has not changed. Lopez Canyon should close on schedule.  
</P>
<P>
 First let's get our facts straight. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiction: The Bureau of Sanitation states in its draft Sanitation Operations 
Strategy Plan that the city pays only $12 a ton to dump trash into Lopez 
Canyon. It sounds pretty cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 Fact: Their numbers are inaccurate. The city spends $14 million a year to dump 
trash at Lopez Canyon. But that amount only gets it from the gate to the dump. 
It costs the city an additional $8 million to transport about half the total 
trash that goes to Lopez Canyon from the transfer site downtown to the gate of 
Lopez Canyon. Since the city dumps 1 million tons, simple math says we pay a 
minimum of $22 a ton, not $12. I stress minimum because the cost it takes to 
transport the other half of our trash to the dump is unknown. The bureau is now 
having to redo that part of its report because its numbers were inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 As we recycle more in the next few years as mandated by the state, trash will 
be reduced and the cost to the city will increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Fiction: In the same draft report, the bureau compares the "$12 a ton to dump 
into Lopez Canyon" to $51 a ton that it estimates it would cost to haul by 
rail. 
</P>
<P>
 Fact: The $51 figure is wrong. After the earthquake, a company made a proposal 
to the city to haul debris by rail to remote sites for $38 a ton. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe we must look at alternatives such as advanced material recovery 
facilities and rail haul. The city is in the final stages of issuing a request 
for proposals and request for bids to provide alternatives to let us see what 
it will really cost us. 
</P>
<P>
 The fact is we've known for years that landfills are filling up. We've known 
for years that Lopez Canyon is going to close. The time for long-term solutions 
to our trash problems is now. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's waste no more time. Let's base our facts on real numbers before making a 
rash decision to break a promise to the community. That's just plain wrong.

REVERSING INCENTIVES TO DEPENDENCY; WELFARE PAYMENTS MUST HAVE A TIME LIMIT, 
WORK MUST BE A REQUIREMENT RATHER THAN AN OPTION AND FAMILY PLANNING MUST 
REPLACE OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY C. BEILENSON, Incumbent Democrat Anthony Beilenson has been a 
congressman since 1977. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times has invited the two leading candidates in the hotly contested race 
for Congress in the 24th District, which includes the southwest San Fernando 
Valley, to write on several issues before the election.  
</P>
<P>
 Incumbent Democrat Anthony Beilenson has been a congressman since 1977. 
Republican Rich Sybert was state director of planning and research from 1991 to 
1993.  
</P>
<P>
 For this article they were asked whether Congress should, in President 
Clinton's phrase, "end welfare as we know it."  
</P>
<P>
 Our welfare system is failing both the people it is supposed to help and the 
rest of us who pay for it. Radical change is needed, and, largely because of 
President Clinton's long interest and leadership, Democrats and Republicans, 
liberals, moderates and conservatives all believe that we can agree on the 
difficult decisions that must be made to "end welfare as we know it." 
</P>
<P>
 The system's failures are widely known: It undercuts the incentive to work and 
isolates the poor from the economic and social mainstream. It fails to promote 
mainstream American values of work, family, individual responsibility and 
self-sufficiency. And, perhaps worst of all, it penalizes marriage and 
underwrites single parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes we make in the welfare system must ensure that work becomes a 
requirement for welfare recipients, not an option. Existing incentives to stay 
on welfare must be replaced with incentives to go to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare must be limited so that it is a transitional program, not a permanent 
one. Time limits -- most proposals suggest two years -- would ensure that the 
obligation to work, not the right to income maintenance, became the underlying 
principle of our new welfare policy. 
</P>
<P>
 While the ultimate goal must be jobs in the private sector, government should 
be prepared to offer minimum-wage community-service jobs, but only as a last 
resort for those unable to obtain a private job and only for work that is 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 As we work at getting people off welfare, it is even more important to keep 
them from entering the system in the first place. The No. 1 goal must be to 
stem the explosion of out-of-wedlock births to teen-age mothers. The rising 
birthrate among unwed mothers has been startling. The Census Bureau recently 
reported that those births rose more than 70% between 1983 and 1993. And in the 
past 30 years, we have witnessed an even more shocking social change: In 1960, 
243,000 children in the United States lived with one parent who had never 
married. By last year that number had soared to 6.3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the changes to our welfare system that should be adopted by Congress 
early next year are a number that make public benefits conditional on behavior: 
</P>
<P>
 * A requirement that welfare recipients postpone additional pregnancies until 
they are married and self-sufficient or, at the least, a limit on benefit 
increases when additional children are born to parents already on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 * A requirement that minor parents live in a household with a responsible 
adult in order to receive benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 * A requirement that benefits be conditional on school attendance to ensure 
that young mothers graduate from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 So long as 400,000 children a year are born to girls with no high school 
diplomas, no husbands and few prospects, we will have the intractable problems 
of welfare dependency -- and of crime and violence. Eighty percent of children 
born to these young women will live in poverty; meanwhile, benefits for 
families begun by teen-agers cost taxpayers $34 billion a year. 
</P>
<P>
 We must have a welfare system that persuades these girls not to become 
pregnant in the first place. We must make family-planning services more widely 
available, as well as preach abstinence and responsibility and make grants 
available to schools to institute teen pregnancy-prevention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 We must also go after absentee fathers for child support as the only effective 
way of making it unmistakably clear that we will insist on individual 
responsibility from young men as well as young women. For the first time, 
individual actions will result in consequences to the individual. 
</P>
<P>
 These new, and stricter, rules to encourage individual responsibility must be 
accompanied, if we are to be successful, by a renewed effort to enforce the 
best parts of our existing system. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress passed an excellent bipartisan welfare-reform bill in 1988 that 
required states to begin providing job-search assistance, training, education, 
transportation and child care -- all recognized as necessary ingredients for 
getting welfare recipients into real jobs. But Congress funded only a fraction 
of the federal portion of the costs, although studies have indicated that the 
program has met with substantial success where it has been tried. 
</P>
<P>
 All of these steps are necessary, but I come back to my principal concern. We 
cannot continue to throw away billions of well-intended dollars on welfare 
payments that are not doing the beneficiaries any good and are also destructive 
to society as a whole. Requiring the use of contraception by welfare recipients 
would be, without question, the most constructive, cost-effective contribution 
we could make to ending welfare dependency and helping young people become 
self-sufficient. 
</P>
<P>
 We must send this serious and much-needed message to our young people. The 
harsh fact is that only if we get serious immediately about slowing the rising 
number of children born out of wedlock can we ever hope to end welfare as we 
know it.

RAMS COLLAPSE BEFORE PATRIOTS; PRO FOOTBALL: WEAK OFFENSIVE LINE MAKES IT A 
MISERABLE NIGHT FOR LOS ANGELES QUARTERBACKS AS NEW ENGLAND WINS, 28-10, IN 
ANAHEIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All overweight truck drivers are urged to contact the Rams for immediate 
employment opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 It's either that, or the Rams stay with their present collection of offensive 
linemen and quarterback Chris Miller's career with the team comes to a crashing 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who were 28-10 losers to the New England Patriots in Saturday 
night's exhibition game at Anaheim Stadium, were at their best in front of a 
crowd of 24,847 only when Miller was allowed time to perform. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who came here marked fragile after a pair of operations on his left 
knee, was smacked twice on his initial attempt to pass in his Ram debut. 
</P>
<P>
 Tackle Darryl Ashmore, who took out teammate Deral Boykin earlier in the week 
by whacking him in the head with his own helmet, failed to protect Miller on 
his first three passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just can't allow this to happen; we know we're a better pass protection 
team than that," said Ashmore, who has replaced Jackie Slater in the starting 
lineup. "We have some things to work on." 
</P>
<P>
 After being sacked, Miller completed his first pass on the run for four yards 
and then was sent scrambling to the sideline for a one-yard gain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It felt good to get hit," said Miller, who hadn't played in a game since 
being injured last September. "We've got a lot of work to do on protection, but 
we'll get those things taken care of." 
</P>
<P>
 Before rookie tackle Wayne Gandy checked into the game, further jeopardizing 
Miller's livelihood, he began mixing short passes with handoffs to Jerome 
Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis ran effectively, Miller completed five passes without an incompletion 
for 51 yards and the Rams marched 80 yards in 16 plays to score. 
</P>
<P>
 Bettis went the final yard to finish an 11:08 drive and establish a 7-0 lead. 
Time to take out Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm always concerned about the quarterbacks getting hit," Coach Chuck Knox 
said. "Chris Miller got hit early on and Chris Chandler got spun to the ground. 
We must do a better job there." 
</P>
<P>
 After Miller's departure, the Rams collapsed and dropped their seventh 
consecutive exhibition game since 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Chandler and Jamie Martin took a beating, Gandy was penalized four times for 
lining up illegally, the offensive line was caught for holding five times and 
the first-defensive unit allowed a pair of touchdowns prior to the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy's penchant for drawing penalties for the same mistake had the small 
crowd hooting in the second quarter. The Rams had passed on selecting 
quarterback Trent Dilfer in the first round of the draft to take Gandy, and now 
it's obvious what lesson he missed after opting to sleep in rather than 
practice after signing a $5 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 A new rule allows offensive linemen to line up off the line of scrimmage so 
long as their helmet remains even with the center's belt buckle. Either center 
Bern Brostek starts sucking in his tummy, or Gandy pays closer attention to 
what's going on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a thing with my stance," Gandy said. "I guess the refs see it as a 
problem. Maybe I just have to change my stance." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Knox: "We had way too many penalties to give ourselves a chance to win 
the football game. They were the type of penalties you shouldn't have. We just 
shot ourselves in the foot." 
</P>
<P>
 Running back David Lang contributed to the onslaught of errors with a fumble 
at the Ram 37-yard line midway through the second quarter. Quarterback Drew 
Bledsoe immediately went in search of cornerback Todd Lyght, found him and 
completed a 37-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver Michael Timpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyght, who gave up a touchdown in last week's 14-6 loss to Green Bay, was also 
beaten for the Patriots' second score with 46 seconds remaining in the half. 
Bledsoe fired a four-yard fastball to wide receiver Vincent Brisby for a 14-7 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams made it 14-10 on the final play of the half with Tony Zendejas' 
41-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Bledsoe took advantage of the Rams' No. 2 defense in the third quarter. He 
moved his team 51 yards in six plays and had running back Kevin Turner run one 
yard for a 21-10 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 New England third-string quarterback Scott Zolak completed the scoring with a 
three-yard touchdown pass to tight end Richard Griffith in the fourth quarter. 
Ram Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Team doctors met with quarterback T.J. Rubley prior to the game and advised 
him to rest his sore arm for two more weeks, which doesn't bode well for his 
future with the team. The Rams will have to cut their roster from 80 to 53 
players without seeing Rubley in action. If they elect to place him on injured 
reserve he will be unable to practice or play the remainder of the year. . . . 
Linebacker Willie McGinest, the Patriots' first-round pick from USC, did not 
make the trip to Anaheim because of a hamstring injury.

RAIDERS FALTER TO STEELERS; PRO FOOTBALL: PITTSBURGH GETS 368 YARDS IN THE 
SECOND HALF AND COMES BACK TO WIN, 29-17. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anthony Smith and Steve Hendrickson. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Raiders. Both defenders. Both participants in Saturday night's 29-17 loss 
to the Pittsburgh Steelers at Three Rivers Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 But there the similarity ends. Smith is a veteran, his job ensured, for whom 
Saturday's game was just a dress rehearsal. Hendrickson is a newcomer, a free 
agent still trying to win a job for whom Saturday's game was another crucial 
test. 
</P>
<P>
 And their moods in the locker room afterward showed how different these 
exhibitions can look from different perspectives. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith did all his sweating on the field and then declared himself more than 
ready for the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to make as few moves as I can to get the job done," the defensive 
lineman said. "They should have started the (regular) season last week. Guys 
are dying. We're ready to go." 
</P>
<P>
 Hendrickson, on the other hand, wasn't through sweating once the game had 
ended on a humid night before 47,399. He figured he would be sweating on the 
plane all the way home, replaying his performance at linebacker in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I'm constantly getting better, but I don't know if it's too 
late," Hendrickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a game, I sit around and yell at myself, correct myself and then move 
on and wait for them to yell at me. It's a mental game, a weird game and I'm 
kind of a weirdo myself." 
</P>
<P>
 No matter how much Hendrickson agonizes, it was only an exhibition for the 
Raider hierarchy. So they can shrug their collective shoulders, take some 
satisfaction from the good they saw on the field, work to correct the bad and 
try to forget the ugly. 
</P>
<P>
 There was plenty of all for the Raiders, who saw their exhibition record drop 
to 2-1. The Steelers are 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The good: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Receiver Daryl Hobbs continues his bid to finally land a spot on the active 
squad in this, his third year as a Raider. For the second week in a row, Hobbs 
stood alone as the team's leading receiver, catching four passes for a 
game-high 62 yards and two touchdowns. Hobbs caught an eight-yard scoring pass 
from quarterback Jeff Hostetler in the first quarter and a 12-yarder from Vince 
Evans in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Evans showed that, at 39, he can still throw long and can still be a 
reliable backup. Evans completed eight of 11 passes for 100 yards despite 
pressure from the Steelers that left Evans with a bruised jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad: 
</P>
<P>
 -- While it was in there, the Raiders' first-unit defense asserted itself and 
kept the Steelers in check. But once the reserves came in, things changed. 
Overall, Pittsburgh rushed for 203 yards, piled up 368 total net yards of 
offense and outscored the Raiders, 15-3, in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Raider running game, often called on to head into the teeth of an 
eight-man Steeler front, gained only 50 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The ugly: 
</P>
<P>
 -- This was far more bruising than an average exhibition. There were punches 
thrown, bruises inflicted, players ejected and 24 penalties. The Raiders were 
penalized 10 times for 81 yards, Pittsburgh 14 times for 135 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- One player from each side was ejected, veteran defensive back Rod Woodson 
of the Steelers for throwing a punch at Charles Jordan, Raider defensive 
lineman Jerry Ball for swinging at John L. Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that aggressive play is part of the game," Ball said. "Displaying 
aggressiveness makes a game exciting. But when a player does something that 
steps over the bounds of aggressiveness, you have to question that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ball questioned a block thrown by Williams that Ball thought was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't the prettiest game in the world," Raider Coach Art Shell said, "but 
it was a tough, physical game. We got an opportunity to look at a lot of 
people, which was our idea coming into the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Steelers got their first look at Barry Foster, the team's star running 
back who sat out the last seven games of last season because of an ankle 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster, who was rested last week, didn't do much more Saturday, carrying only 
three times for 12 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Steeler scores came on an 18-yard, first-quarter run by Dwight Stone off a 
reverse, a three-yard, second-quarter touchdown pass from Neil O'Donnell to Tim 
Jorden and two one-yard runs by fullback Victor Jones in the fourth quarter, 
topped off by a two-point conversion run by Randy Cuthbert. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Jaeger kicked the only field goal of the game, a 27-yarder. 
</P>
<P>
 Poised at the Raider 10-yard line in the closing minute, Pittsburgh chose to 
run out the clock rather than run up the score. Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders gave up four sacks and had three. . . . Defensive linemen Chester 
McGlockton (bruised foot) and Willie Broughton (elbow), receiver Alexander 
Wright (calf), defensive backs Patrick Bates (leg) and Torin Dorn (hamstring), 
and linebacker Brian Jones (ankle) did not suit up for the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive lineman Bruce Wilkerson was removed from the game in the first 
quarter after a bruised foot was injured again. . . . Pittsburgh wide receiver 
Charles Johnson, the team's 1994 first-round draft choice, was held out because 
of a shoulder injury.

THE PACK CLOSES IN ON PRICE; PGA CHAMPIONSHIP: ZIMBABWEAN SEES HIS LEAD CUT TO 
THREE STROKES OVER HAAS; PAVIN, MICKELSON ARE FOUR BACK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The gap is narrowing at the PGA Championship, in which the best golfers in the 
world took aim at Nick Price's five-shot lead and a few of them were somewhat 
lucky to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is, Price will tote a three-shot lead into today's final round at 
Southern Hills, where the year's fourth and final major title will be won. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though Price already has one, the British Open, this still has to mean 
big pressure, the kind that can melt your confidence or your sand wedge, or 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely, Price was going to be positively quivering in his bed Saturday night. 
How will he be, Nick at night? 
</P>
<P>
 "I guarantee you I will sleep well," Price said. "I always sleep well." 
</P>
<P>
 How could he be so sure? 
</P>
<P>
 "My kids aren't here." 
</P>
<P>
 The three players closest to Price are Jay Haas, who hasn't won a major, Corey 
Pavin, who hasn't won a major, and Phil Mickelson, who . . . you get the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Price has been anointed by many here as golf's next god, but he shot a 
decidedly human 70 Saturday for a 54-hole score of 202. He also lost two 
strokes off his lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Price decided to look on the bright side, which seems to be rather large. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, today was the one bad round I'm going to have all week and I got 
away with even par," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price is three shots ahead of Haas, 40, who has won twice in the last six 
years. Haas' greatest gift might be that he is quite resilient. He shot 68 
Saturday and survived his second triple bogey in two days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think it could happen again," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas wasn't the only one of Price's principal pursuers to have something bad 
happen to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson's 67 included a double-bogey on No. 12, while Pavin had a double 
bogey at No. 14 on his way to a 69. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickelson and Pavin are tied for third at 206, one shot behind Haas and four 
behind Price. Then there is a three-way tie for fifth at 207 featuring Greg 
Norman, Ben Crenshaw and John Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Price's round was steady, not spectacular, and he blamed his overly 
conservative attitude. No matter how much he enjoys being a front-runner, he 
acknowledged that his big lead altered his approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a strange feeling going out there with a five-stroke lead in a major 
championship," he said. "It's a difficult situation. I've got everything to 
lose, I suppose, but I persevered." 
</P>
<P>
 So he did. Nothing like Haas, though. Start with the good: when Haas birdied 
No. 13 and Price bogeyed No. 12, Haas was within one shot of the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came No. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a routine 405-yard par four, but Haas played it anything but routinely. 
He pushed his drive and it nicked a tree and landed in the short rough 180 
yards from the front of the green. 
</P>
<P>
 He knocked a seven-iron through the green and the ball landed in a back 
bunker. He mis-hit his chip shot and the ball landed in a valley behind the 
green. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas stubbed the chip and it barely got on the fringe of the green. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now I'm pretty shook," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Haas missed his putt and the ball rolled six feet past the hole. He missed 
that putt, too. He made the next for a seven. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost didn't even want to start adding it up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Price said he immediately noticed the scoreboard. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they made a mistake on the scoreboard," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 They hadn't. Haas pulled himself together with birdies on No. 16 and No. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Haas had seven birdies, two bogeys, a triple bogey and eight pars. 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin's double bogey might have been overshadowed by two great chip shots he 
made on the closing holes. He chipped in from 30 feet for a birdie on No. 16 
and saved par on No. 17 when he chipped in again, this time from 40 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, it was an interesting day," Pavin said. 
</P>
<P>
 This is exactly what Price is hoping for today. Mickelson said if anyone is 
going to beat Price, he is going to have to come up with something special. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's at the top of his game," Mickelson said. "He's the best player in the 
world, I have no doubt about it. But I think if he doesn't shoot three- or 
four-under par, somebody's going to have a good shot at catching him." 
</P>
<P>
 Pavin said the pressure rests squarely on Price. He sounded a lot like someone 
trying very hard to get an edge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to lead a major championship going into the last round," Pavin 
said. "He's got a lot of pressure on him and it's going to be difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not an easy thing to do. So we'll just see what happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Price said he is ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those guys, I know they're all going to come at me tomorrow," he said. "I've 
already prepared myself for that."

U.S. TEAM NEEDS ONLY STRONG HALF TO MAKE A WHOLE; BASKETBALL: AMERICANS 
SLEEPWALK PAST GREECE, 97-58, AND INTO TITLE GAME TODAY AGAINST RUSSIA. 
</P>

 Beware of Greeks bearing gifts. Informed the top Greek players would make only 
cameo appearances Saturday night, the United States hit the snooze alarm, 
resulting in a first half that looked like the Dallas Mavericks playing the 
Minnesota Timberwolves. 
</P>
<P>
 Awaking at halftime, the Americans turned a 10-point lead into a 97-58 rout 
and advanced to the World Championships final today in a rematch against 
Russia, a surprise 66-64 winner over Croatia. The United States defeated 
Russia, 111-94, on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Greeks, well rested after using their top four players 22 minutes or less, 
meet Croatia for the bronze medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "The game was more like a celebration for us," said Greek guard Panagiotis 
Yiannakis. 
</P>
<P>
 "First of all, we are happy to qualify to be in the top four in the world. 
Tonight we were playing with players five or six years ago we couldn't imagine. 
And we were able to save our energy and focus on playing for the bronze medal." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Don Nelson, concerned about fatigue after seven games in 10 days, 
planned to play his own top players lightly and started a new lineup: Alonzo 
Mourning, Larry Johnson, Dominique Wilkins, Mark Price and Dan Majerle. 
Mourning and Price had played well but Johnson has been invisible, Majerle 
erratic and Nelson's plan for 'Nique, until he griped, was a lot of bench time. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. starters missed 21 of 26 shots in the first half and Nelson started 
subbing in his top five: Shaquille O'Neal, Shawn Kemp, Reggie Miller, Joe 
Dumars and Kevin Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaq entered with 11:21 left in the half and the United States trailing, 
17-14. The Americans then regained the lead, went up by 10 at the half and 
decided to try the second half with their eyes open. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't our best start, as I'm sure you're aware," said Nelson. "I think 
the important thing, two things were accomplished: first of all, we got to rest 
a lot of our players who have played a lot. Secondly, we had a change of energy 
in the second half." 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans started the half with a 27-8 run. By the time it was over, the 
new Greek coach, Makos Dendrinos, had all his top players on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Greeks, merely appearing on the court with the United States was a 
dream. Picked to go nowhere, they started the tournament by losing their coach, 
Efthimis Kiounourtzolov, who resigned after a spat with star center Panagiotis 
Fassoulas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I missed a practice and he ordered me off the team," said Fassoulas. "He went 
to the Greek federation but the federation could not take the responsibility. 
He took an airplane and left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a pretty good team. Our goals were not so high, to tell you the 
truth. Our goal was to get to the final eight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Actually Greek players are tired of the national team. I've been playing 
since 1981." 
</P>
<P>
 The Greeks' joy in the experience was barely fazed by the nightly display of 
American boorishness. Whether from boredom, immaturity or both, several U.S. 
players -- notably Derrick Coleman -- can't seem to grasp their role as 
ambassadors. On Saturday, Coleman snapped off a long string of obscenities at 
Greek players sitting on their bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were going through the motions," said Kevin Johnson. "We want to play and 
then get out of here. Win the gold and get back and enjoy our summer." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long month. Part of it is you expect to play against great 
competition. That makes the situation so much more exciting. I'm taking nothing 
away from these teams but that hasn't been the case. We haven't been challenged 
and we're fighting a ghost (of the Dream Team ). . . . That's not what it's all 
about." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Croatia had been considered a lock for the silver medal and seemed a certain 
finalist when Russia's top player, Andrei Fetisov, a second-round pick in the 
recent NBA draft, injured his right ankle 3 1/2 minutes into the game and never 
returned. Croatia's Dino Radja (Boston Celtics) had 16 points and 14 rebounds, 
but was just 4-for-16 from the field. Toni Kukoc (Chicago Bulls) finished with 
five points and was 2-for-8 from the field with two assists, his lowest total 
of the tournament. . . . Augusto Duquesne, 24, became the second Cuban player 
to defect, slipping out of his downtown hotel and into a getaway van, joining 
star player Richard Matienzo, 25, who had pulled a similar escape the day 
before, the Toronto Star reported. . . . The Portland Trail Blazers have 
submitted a bid to host the event, likely in 2002.

SLIMS EVENT FINAL MATCHES OLD FOES; TENNIS: GROSSMAN DEFEATS HALARD, 1-6, 6-3, 
6-1, AND FRAZIER BEATS APPELMANS, 6-2, 6-4, AT MANHATTAN BEACH.

<P>
 Past winners of the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles have included some of the 
biggest names in women's tennis -- Navratilova, Seles, Graf, Evert. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the 23-year-old event is offering an all-Midwestern final featuring Ann 
Grossman of Grove City, Ohio, and Amy Frazier of Rochester Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't ask, "Who?" too loudly. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the new age," Grossman said Saturday after defeating the 
highest-ranked player left in the semifinals, No. 18 Julie Halard of France, 
1-6, 6-3, 6-1. "That is what everyone wants, right?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not exactly. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is what everyone gets after the name players either dropped out 
beforehand or, as was the case with Conchita Martinez, Martina Navratilova and 
Jana Novotna, were upset during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the youngsters now," said Sabine Appelmans of Belgium, who lost to 
Frazier, 6-2, 6-4, in the other semifinal before 5,484 at the Manhattan Country 
Club in Manhattan Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 By advancing to the championship match, Frazier joined her longtime tennis 
pal. She and Grossman have been friends since they were 9-year-old juniors. 
Their professional careers have taken similar paths to obscurity, overshadowed 
by the tour's stars. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time Frazier saw her rival, Grossman was playing one of her friends 
from Michigan in a tournament at Columbus, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the size of the net and hit the ball so hard," Frazier recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman still whacks away. And, as it turns out, she can hit the broadside of 
a barn. As a child, she practiced hitting inside a barn on her parent's farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cows were on one side and the pigs were in the back," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier visited her childhood friend on the farm, and has traveled the women's 
tour with her. But she has yet to defeat her as a pro. Grossman has won two 
tough three-setters, including the quarterfinals of the 1992 Evert Cup at 
Indian Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 But if she continues her roll, Frazier, 21, could change that. No. 26 Frazier 
has yet to drop a set in the week-long tournament. She has overcome a weak 
serve by utilizing her powerful strokes to the utmost. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's hitting the ball so hard," Appelmans said. "The balls are so fast, so 
deep. She can beat anybody when she's playing like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Frazier's poise also has been a factor. Even when dropping a tough game, she 
keeps pounding the ball. In the second set, she and Appelmans played 28 points 
in the third game before Frazier lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, No. 20 Appelmans broke Frazier by powering a forehand down the line. But 
Frazier stayed calm. She held her next serve, saved two break points in the 
eighth game and broke back in the ninth.  
</P>
<P>
 Then a strong service game sent Appelmans out without much fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite her outstanding play, Frazier, once a member of TeamTennis' Newport 
Dukes, has downplayed the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 46 Grossman, on the other hand, could not be happier. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman, 23, reached the final by playing four consecutive three-set matches, 
including a sweltering semifinal in which she grew stronger the longer she ran 
around the court. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third set, Grossman dominated Halard, who was suffering from stomach 
problems. By then, Halard's hard-hitting game had melted under the broiling 
sun. Her eyes were glassy, her strokes punchless. 
</P>
<P>
 "At 3-0, I knew I had her," Grossman said. 
</P>
<P>
 So did everyone watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you don't have any more legs, it's difficult to go for it," Halard said. 
"She made me run and that was it." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman was especially satisfied with her ability to rebound after losing the 
first set four days in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 About Saturday's slow start, Grossman said: "I came out playing pretty dumb. 
The first set I was just miserable. I was so tired. I said, 'Jeez, can you make 
it through?' " 
</P>
<P>
 She could, and she did.

TENNIS; EDBERG, CHANG IN ATP FINAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Chang, known for his ferocious baseline game, turned the tables on 
big-hitting David Wheaton on Saturday, serving 13 aces en route to a semifinal 
victory in the $1.72 million ATP Championship. 
</P>
<P>
 The defending champion was a 6-3, 6-4 winner and in the final today will play 
Stefan Edberg of Sweden, who defeated Michael Stich, 6-2, 7-6 (8-6), rallying 
from a 5-1 deficit in the tiebreaker. Stich double-faulted on match point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today was the best I've ever seen him serve in his life," Wheaton, a 
6-foot-4, 185-pounder, said of the 5-9, 150-pound Chang. "Aces aren't really 
his game, but he was able to do it today. He was consistently serving as hard 
as I was, in the 115 m.p.h. range. If he can serve 115, I should be able to 
serve 140." 
</P>
<P>
 Wheaton, who had to play through a local qualifier to get into the main draw, 
said Chang's precision shots had him all over the court. Most players try to 
run Chang around. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my seventh match in eight days, and that's pretty tough," Wheaton 
said. "I felt a little bit slow, maybe because I've played so many matches. But 
maybe it's because he's so fast he makes me look slow." 
</P>
<P>
 Chang, a four-time winner this year on the ATP Tour, had been averaging 3.7 
aces per match. But he overwhelmed Wheaton by winning 43 of 62 service points, 
to Wheaton's 35 of 61. 
</P>
<P>
 "My serve's been working well this week," Chang said. "If I had started to 
miss and had given David a lot of opportunities, I would have taken something 
off it. I wasn't hitting as hard as I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg lost to Chang in last year's title match. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think I need to do that much different to win (against Chang)," 
Edberg said. "What's important with Michael is to stay with him in the 
beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 Edberg has an 11-5 career record against Chang.

GOLF ROUNDUP; WARD BEATS MCGILL FOR WOMEN'S AMATEUR TITLE

<P>
 Wendy Ward won the 94th U.S. Women's Amateur when she birdied the toughest par 
five on the course and her opponent, defending champion Jill McGill, bogeyed 
the easiest par five. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's birdie on the 16th hole and McGill's bogey on No. 17 added up to the 
decisive margin in a 2-and-1 victory Saturday at Hot Springs, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 They were even after Ward three-putted the 14th. Ward went back in front after 
sinking a 10-foot birdie putt on the 494-yard 16th and McGill missed a 
12-footer. 
</P>
<P>
 On 17, a 450-yard dogleg left, McGill's drive went left and ended up in the 
rough. Her second shot clipped some low-hanging branches, and she had to punch 
out her third shot. Her fourth shot landed on the front fringe, 25 feet away. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, 21, of San Antonio, who will be a senior at Arizona State, lost in the 
semifinals last year. 
</P>
<P>
 McGill, 22, of Denver, who had an outstanding career at USC, said she is now 
ready to turn pro. McGill had won 23 of her previous 24 amateur matches. 
</P>

<P>
 Alicia Dibos holed out a shot from a bunker to take a one-stroke lead in the 
first Children's Medical Center LPGA Classic at Beavercreek, Ohio. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosie Jones held a two-stroke lead at the 13th but took a quadruple-bogey 
seven on the par-three hole. Twice she put six-iron shots into the lake 
fronting the green on the 135-yard hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Dibos, a native of Peru who started the day in second place at five-under, 
dropped to six shots back of Jones at the turn after bogeying four holes on the 
front side. But she regrouped with a string of three birdies at the 12th, the 
fateful 13th and the 14th to get back in it.

 Former Ram quarterback Jim Everett completed 14 of 22 passes for 182 yards and 
two touchdowns in the New Orleans Saints' 21-17 loss to the Minnesota Vikings 
in an exhibition at Minneapolis on Saturday. Everett was sacked only once.  
</P>
<P>
 Warren Moon completed only nine of 20 passes for 131 yards but drove the 
Vikings to a touchdown late in the second half, connecting with Cris Carter on 
a 22-yard pass play. 
</P>
<P>
 Scottie Graham scored the decisive touchdown for the Vikings on a five-yard 
run late in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Brown, surviving a shaky start, completed 15 of 21 passes for 187 yards 
and one touchdown and also ran nine yards for a score in his first start as the 
New York Giants defeated the San Diego Chargers, 28-20, at Berlin's Olympic 
Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, who beat out Kent Graham in the battle to replace Phil Simms, threw two 
near interceptions in the first quarter and his fumble set up the Chargers' 
first touchdown. Graham was eight of nine for 93 yards and was three of three 
for 47 yards on the drive that gave the Giants the lead for good in the third 
quarter. He connected with Omar Douglas on a five-yard touchdown pass in the 
closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Trent Dilfer and running back Errict Rhett were unproductive in 
their debuts for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers in a 29-6 loss to the Seahawks at 
Husky Stadium in Seattle. 
</P>
<P>
 Dilfer completed only four of eight passes for 40 yards and lost a fumble that 
was returned for a touchdown. Rhett was held to 20 yards in 11 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 For the Seahawks, Rick Mirer completed 10 of 18 passes for 141 yards and one 
touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lamont Warren replaced an injured Marshall Faulk and ran for 71 yards and 
scored two fourth-quarter touchdowns as the Indianapolis Colts defeated the 
Cincinnati Bengals, 26-21, at Cincinnati. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren's second touchdown came with 58 seconds left on a 62-yard pass play, 
with Warren running 50 yards. Faulk, the No. 2 pick in the draft, suffered a 
bruised lower back in the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bengal backup quarterback Jay Schroeder led the Bengals to three second-half 
touchdowns and intensified the pressure on struggling David Klingler. Schroeder 
completed 15 of 21 for 192 yards with one interception, while Klingler 
completed 10 of 19 for 142 yards in the first half, but frequently missed 
receivers and failed on all three passes inside the 10-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Irving Spikes, who was signed as a free agent after being ignored on draft 
day, rushed for a touchdown and set up two others with kickoff returns of 71 
and 51 yards as the Miami Dolphins beat the Green Bay Packers, 31-24, at 
Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 Spikes, who had the fourth-best rushing average in the nation, 149.5 yards, 
last year at Northeast Louisiana, provided Miami with the winning margin when 
he scored from three yards to give the Dolphins a 31-17 lead with 13:59 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Marino, making his second appearance since suffering a ruptured Achilles' 
tendon Oct. 10, led the Dolphins 84 yards on their first possession for an 8-0 
lead. In his only series of the night, Marino completed six of seven passes for 
60 yards, capping the drive with an 11-yarder to Mark Ingram. Marino also went 
to Ingram for the two-point conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jim McMahon, playing only the first three series for the Arizona Cardinals, 
completed four of six passes for 35 yards, but Chicago Bear starter Eric 
Kramer, who completed one of seven passes, led his team to a 16-0 victory at 
Tempe, Ariz. The difference was penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Phoenix cornerback James Williams twice helped Chicago drives to continue with 
pass interference calls. In the first quarter, Williams knocked down wide 
receiver Jeff Graham at the Arizona 16 before a pass got to him. That set up a 
field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Late in the second quarter, Williams again was called for interference, this 
time against Greg Primus at the Cardinal four. But the Bears had to settle for 
another field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Boomer Esiason threw one touchdown pass, left the game, then came back to 
throw another as the New York Jets defeated the Eagles, 34-24, at Philadelphia. 
Esiason finished seven of 13 for 128 yards. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Rookie Derrick Alexander from Michigan returned a fourth-quarter punt 75 yards 
for a touchdown in the Browns' 16-7 victory over the Detroit Lions at

SOCCER; U.S. WOMEN'S 9-0 VICTORY OVER MEXICO A GOOD OMEN

<P>
 The first country the U.S. women's national soccer team defeated on the road 
to its world championship victory in China in 1991 was Mexico, which was 
trounced, 12-0. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the omens for repeating as champions in 1995 look good. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday evening, the Americans defeated Mexico again, this time by a 9-0 
score, in their first qualifying match for second FIFA Women's World 
Championship in Sweden next June. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States got two goals apiece from Christine Lilly and Michelle 
Akers-Stahl, while five other players also found the net at Claude Robillard 
Stadium in Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Lilly scored the opening goal with a header in the sixth minute off a corner 
kick from Carin Gabarra and Gabarra finished off the rout herself in the 90th 
minute as the Mexicans were overwhelmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played a very solid match," said U.S. assistant coach Tony DiCicco, who 
takes over as coach from Anson Dorrance after this CONCACAF regional qualifying 
tournament. "Mexico will have its day in this tournament. This is a better team 
than we faced in 1991." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States led, 4-0, at the half and, after the Americans' sixth goal, 
Mexico switched goalkeepers, to little avail. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexicans were outshot, 27-2, with Tisha Venturini, Mia Hamm, Tiffany 
Roberts and Jennifer Lalor also scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 In the opening game of the five-nation qualifying tournament, Canada defeated 
Jamaica, 7-0, with Charmaine Hooper, the sister of Canadian national team 
player Lyndon Hooper, scoring a hat trick. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States' next match is on Wednesday against Trinidad & Tobago.

NO ACE BUT VICTORY WAS IN CARDS FOR NORTHRIDGE; LITTLE LEAGUE: VALLEY SQUAD 
ADVANCES, 10-0, BEHIND GENTILE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The opponent was Las Vegas, but the gambler was Larry Baca, manager of the 
Northridge Little League 12-year-old all-stars. 
</P>
<P>
 Baca did not start staff ace Nathaniel Dunlap on Saturday night for the second 
consecutive game, giving the ball instead to Justin Gentile. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile hit the jackpot, allowing only three singles in five innings of 
Northridge's 10-0 victory in the second round of the Western Regional 
tournament before 6,500. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile, the Northridge leadoff batter, also hit two home runs and drove in 
three runs. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile, a right-hander, overcame early wildness, leaving the bases loaded in 
the first inning. He struck out 10 and walked two. 
</P>
<P>
 "With this staff I don't have to pitch a guy and have to come back with him on 
one day's rest," Baca said. "It's nice to have this luxury, and it especially 
helps when we hit this well." 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring single runs in the first and second innings with the help of 
five wild pitches, Northridge (14-0) exploded for three in the third and three 
in the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Cassel followed Matt Fisher's run-scoring double with a long home run to 
center field in the third, and Gentile hit a solo home run with one out in the 
fourth. Four of the next five batters hit safely, including a double by Cassel 
and singles by Matt Cunningham, Dunlap and Fisher. 
</P>
<P>
 Gentile hit a two-run home run in the fifth to complete the scoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge has outscored its opponents, 193-33, in tournament play, one reason 
Baca feels comfortable keeping Dunlap in his hip pocket. Peter Tuber allowed 
only one hit in five innings of Northridge's 14-2 first-round victory over 
Anchorage, Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap, a 5-foot-11 right-hander with an overpowering fastball, has so far 
been nothing more than a dominant mop-up pitcher, retiring the side in order in 
the sixth innings of both blowouts. He struck out two against Las Vegas (7-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge will face New Mexico on Monday at 8 p.m. in a quarterfinal, and 
Baca says . . . he has not decided on a starting pitcher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I may go with Tuber again," Baca said. "He didn't throw too many pitches 
(Friday)."

TU TALKS, TU ANSWERS, TU RALLIES TO TAKE TENNIS TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA HADDAD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Meilen Tu's reputation as a deadly baseline player spread far and wide this 
year when she won a couple of international junior tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 She unleashed a new weapon Saturday in the singles final of the United States 
Tennis Assn. Girls' 18 national championships: 
</P>
<P>
 Psychobabble. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tu lost the opening set to Lilia Osterloh of Winchester, Ohio, the 
Northridge resident was heard mumbling between points in the second set. 
</P>
<P>
 "This point." . . . "Come on.". . . "It's OK." . . . "Hang in," Tu kept 
muttering. The self-talk sparked top-seeded Tu, who disarmed seventh-seeded 
Osterloh, 4-6, 6-3, 6-3, at Almaden Valley Athletic Club in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everybody could hear me," Tu said. "I was nervous, and talking to 
myself helped me relax and play better. I wanted the title. This is a pretty 
big win for me." 
</P>
<P>
 This, Tu's first USTA national title, is probably as important as her 
grass-court championship in England and her clay-court title in South America 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, at 14, she won the USTA national clay court championship in the 
16-and-under division to boost her national ranking to No. 2. But the 
hard-court tournament is what the USTA considers the national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Tu was seeded second in 18s in that tournament in 1992, but defaulted in the 
round of 16 with a hamstring injury. Last year she was seeded fifth and was 
bothered by back and ankle miseries when she lost to eventual champion Janet 
Lee in the quarterfinals. 
</P>
<P>
 And it looked like Osterloh, who lost in the final of the national girls' 16s 
tournament in 1993, would provide more disappointment for Tu. Osterloh led, 
4-0, in the first set. Not only was Tu struggling with her serve, she was 
giving Osterloh too many opportunities for passing shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a bit slow and she was painting the lines," Tu said. "We were both 
banging away. I kept banging away the whole tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 None of Tu's previous opponents could handle her powerful ground strokes. One 
by one, they wilted: Meredith Laughlin (6-0, 6-2) in the first round, Kelly 
Baskin (6-0, 6-0), Justyna Gudzowska (6-0, 6-3), Adrien Alder (6-0, 6-1), Tara 
Snyder (6-1, 6-4) and rival Ania Bleszynski of Thousand Oaks (6-1, 6-2) in the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But with Osterloh hitting passing shots, Tu had to change her strategy. She 
changed angles and speeds from point to point. 
</P>
<P>
 Tu broke Osterloh's serve to win it. And on match point -- when she hit a 
backhand return for a winner -- Tu was still coaching herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't sure I wanted to do that, but I decided to go for it," she said. 
"And I ripped it. I was so relieved when it went in."

SALSA FINALLY TAKES SLIGHT REVENGE, BEATS COLORADO FOXES, 3-0 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It took a little longer than the Salsa figured, but the team finally delivered 
some pay-back Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa dominated the American Professional Soccer League champion Colorado 
Foxes, 3-0, in front of a crowd of 3,147 at Titan Stadium, easing the pain of 
last season's overtime title-game loss to the Foxes -- albeit slightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa came up short in two previous attempts to avenge its 3-1 loss in the 
championship game, losing to the Foxes in the teams' first two games of the 
season at Denver's Mile High Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were due to beat these guys," forward Paul Wright said. "It feels really 
good to finally beat them -- especially the way we did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Which was thoroughly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa, which lost three of its previous four games, outplayed the Foxes 
beginning in the middle of the first half in one of its best games of the 
season. The Salsa (5-5) moved into third place in the APSL. The Foxes dropped 
to 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright helped provide all the scoring the Salsa would need. In the 44th 
minute, Wright made a nifty pass to defender Danny Pena that he drilled past 
Colorado goalkeeper Mark Dodd. Paulinho -- the league's 1993 MVP -- gave the 
Salsa a 2-0 lead early in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 50th minute, the Brazilian midfielder controlled his own rebound of a 
free kick and scored. It was Paulinho's first goal in four matches. Forward 
Arut Karapetyan made a swift move past Dodd to close the game's scoring in the 
84th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Karapetyan eluded a Colorado defender at midfield and made an off-balance, 
left-footed shot that sent Dodd into a fit. It capped the Salsa's smoothest 
showing on offense in quite a while, according to Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offense was really working," Wright said. "We were making good passes and 
getting good shots, but our defense was even better." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks in large part to goalkeeper Mike Littman. 
</P>
<P>
 Littman improved to 3-1 and shut out his second opponent. He turned away six 
shots, including three during a frantic sequence late in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always good to beat the champion," Littman said. "I'd like to play 
Colorado and beat them every game. We played well when we were up in Colorado, 
we were just real unfortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys played great in front of me, which let me stay in good shape out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to scoring the first goal, Pena did a sound job of helping to 
neutralize Colorado forward Walter Boyd and midfielder Ted Eck, two of the 
league's fastest players. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a good win for us," Wright said. "Hopefully we can build on it."

SPLASH TAKES HOME FIRST 'I-5 CUP,' BY BEATING SOCKERS, 12-8, IN KEY GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armando Valdivia missed the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dale Ervine missed the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither was missed at all. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash turned in what might have been a division-clinching performance 
Saturday night at the San Diego Sports Arena in front of 8,480, beating San 
Diego, 12-8. It was their fourth victory in a row and sixth in seven games, and 
also makes them 2-0 on a seven-game trip. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory gives the Splash (15-5) a two-game lead over the Sockers (14-8) -- 
but they are three games ahead in the loss column. The Splash also won the 
season series and claimed the first I-5 Cup, a perpetual trophy shared by the 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't express the importance of this game," Splash forward Rod Castro said. 
"We have to win the games in our division on the road. We proved that we could 
beat San Diego here." 
</P>
<P>
 On a night when the offense was supposed to be severely tested, the Splash got 
help from some unusual sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia (28 points) missed the game after spraining his knee in practice this 
week; he is expected to be out two to three weeks. Ervine (49 points) missed 
the second half because of a sprained big toe and will miss tonight's game in 
Sacramento, the Western Division's third-place team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Armando's absence is a tremendous loss," Splash Coach George Fernandez said. 
"But this (was) a good test. Let's see how this team responds -- can they 
answer the challenge, do we have depth? I say we do." 
</P>
<P>
 In Valdivia's place, defender Doug Neely was moved to midfield and Shane 
Hickson was moved to the back. And the offense didn't lag. 
</P>
<P>
 Neely had two goals and an assist in the first half and finished with a hat 
trick, his third of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, six players with fewer than 10 goals this season scored: Denis Hamlett 
had two (giving him eight this season), Paul McDonnell scored his ninth, Paul 
Ratcliffe scored his eighth, Jaime Francisco scored his second, Bobby Reyes 
scored his first, and Juan Carlos Sanchez scored his first two professional 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Raffaele Ruotolo (53 points) had a goal and an assist, extending to 21 his 
record for consecutive games with an assist. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Castro (37 points) had three assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "We spread the load around," Fernandez said. "The young players stepped it up. 
The first 1 1/2 quarters was as good as we've played this year." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlett and Neely were involved in three of the first four goals as the Splash 
took a 7-3 halftime lead; the closest San Diego got was four goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Valenzuela was superb in goal with 16 saves; the final two Sockers' 
goals came on balls that bounced embarrassingly off Ralph Black and Ratcliffe. 
Still, the defense played well against the Sockers, who have won 10 of the last 
12 indoor titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez also said this was the team's best road performance of the year. It 
comes on the heels of its previous best road show, a 5-4 victory at Arizona.

SAUGUS SPEEDWAY; CROMSIGT WINS CRASH-MARRED MAIN

 Pine Mountain's Gerrit Cromsigt came from 22nd place to win his seventh 25-lap 
Pro Stock main event Saturday night before 3,380 at Saugus Speedway. 
</P>
<P>
 The race, which featured an inverted start with the fastest cars in the back 
of the pack, was marred by three crashes in the final four laps, with the 
checkered flag being waved while the race was stopped after Playa del Rey's 
Mike Gatto flew into the wall on the final lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatto was apparently unhurt in the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda's Richard Smith, who is third in the points standings, was running 
second when the race was stopped, and another Reseda resident, Richard 
Karvasek, was third. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 25-lap Street Stock feature, points leader John Schultz of Valencia 
added to his lead over Alta Loma's Kirk Miller with a four-length victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz also finished third in the four-lap trophy dash, behind Jeff Drummen 
of Northridge and Dean Grizzaffi of Granada Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Drummen was third in the feature, just ahead of Whittier's Greg Benner and San 
Pedro's Mike Price. 
</P>
<P>
 Schultz started the main event from the second position and immediately 
grabbed the lead, only to be passed on the second lap by Grizzaffi, Drummen and 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Hynes of West Hills picked up his first feature victory in the 20-lap 
Mini Stock main event.

BEACH VOLLEYBALL; STRATEGY PAYS DIVIDEND FOR DODD, WHITMARSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no secret to any professional beach volleyball player what the strategy 
of Mike Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh will be when they step on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are the first to admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we get points is off the block or dig because we won't get any off 
the serve," Whitmarsh said following his team's 12-7 victory over Karch Kiraly 
and Kent Steffes in the finals of the winner's bracket at the Miller Lite Open 
tournament here Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd and Whitmarsh will find out this morning whether they will face Kiraly 
and Steffes again or Randy Stoklos and Adam Johnson when those two teams face 
off in the consolation final at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's final will follow at approximately noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd and Whitmarsh, the defending Seal Beach champions, kept the top-seeded 
duo of Kiraly and Steffes from staging any of their trademark rallies and held 
the lead for the entire match. 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't get any rallies," Whitmarsh said. "It's really important to 
stay on top of them." 
</P>
<P>
 After Dodd and Whitmarsh jumped out to a 6-2 lead, Kiraly and Steffes put 
together their only challenge of the match, cutting the lead to one point 
before the second-seeded pair rolled off four consecutive points for a 10-5 
advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight off the run was a fake spike by Dodd, who then spun in the air 
and, with his back to the net, reeled off a backhand spike that landed on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd and Whitmarsh then were able to keep Kiraly and Steffes in the check 
until the rally clock expired. 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's semifinals, the fourth-seeded team of Sandra Pires and Jackie 
Silva advanced to the final with a 12-8 victory over defending champions Cammy 
Ciarelli and Holly McPeak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilian pair will be looking for their second consecutive AVP tournament 
win when they face top-seeded Nancy Reno and Angela Rock at 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Pires and Silva defeated Reno and Rock, 15-9, in the second round Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Unger and his new partner, Scott Friedrichsen, who came into the 
tournament seeded 13th, upset several teams to finish fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Unger, whose previous highest AVP finish was ninth, delighted the crowd with 
his ability to hold his own at the net despite being only 5-foot-11.

CARDINALS OPEN SERIES WITH ROUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Cardinals put on an impressive offensive display in their 
opening game of the Connie Mack World Series Saturday in Farmington, N.M. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals beat Detroit, 12-2, in a game shortened to five innings because 
of the mercy rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Tommy Louie, a graduate of Irvine High, had two hits, including a home run, 
and drove in four runs for the Cardinals (30-5). 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County has outscored opponents, 57-19, in its last five games. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Baker, a graduate of Tustin High, added two hits and two runs batted in 
also for the Cardinals, who scored six runs in the third to break a 2-2 tie. 
The Cardinals scored another run in the fourth and three in the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Zamora, a graduate of Capistrano Valley High, gave up three hits and two 
runs in the first inning but didn't allow a hit over the next three innings to 
get the victory. He had seven strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cardinals play host Farmington on Monday.

DEL MAR; TINNERS WAY BEATS BEST PAL IN THE CLASSIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For trainer Bobby Frankel, there has been good, better and best in the 
$1-million Pacific Classic, and he rated Saturday as the best after his lightly 
regarded Tinners Way made a late run to beat Best Pal by one length. 
</P>
<P>
 Frankel won the 1992 Classic with Missionary Ridge and repeated last year with 
Bertrando, whose owners switched trainers this year. Bertrando, the 2-1 
favorite Saturday, was victimized by an early duel with Slew Of Damascus for 
the lead and finished next to last in the nine-horse field. 
</P>
<P>
 "This win makes me feel the best of all," Frankel said. "It's not revenge, but 
it's always nice to beat the horse that you trained last year. This should help 
my career more than anything." 
</P>
<P>
 The 53-year-old Frankel's horses earned $8.6 million last year and he won the 
Eclipse Award for best trainer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I know all that, but a trainer's only as good as his last win, just 
like in other sports," Frankel said. "How many times have you seen a guy win a 
huge race, and then the next time you see them, they've disappeared?" 
</P>
<P>
 Tinners Way, who matched the track record of 1:59 2/5 set by Bertrando in last 
year's Classic, had never raced or worked out at Del Mar, remaining at 
Hollywood Park until two days ago. Frankel, concerned about numerous injuries 
that his horses suffered over the Del Mar track a year ago, has been vanning 
his horses 100 miles from Hollywood Park to run at Del Mar this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Tinners Way also had a new jockey, Eddie Delahoussaye. Kent Desormeaux, who 
rode the 4-year-old son of Secretariat and Devon Diva to one victory in eight 
starts this year, was at Saratoga, finishing second to Heavenly Prize aboard 
the odds-on favorite, Lakeway, in the Alabama Stakes. Frankel was going to hire 
Pat Day for the Pacific Classic, but Day didn't immediately return the 
trainer's phone call, and in the meantime Delahoussaye's agent, Terry Lipham, 
asked if they could have the mount. According to Frankel, Delahoussaye could 
have had the mount on Best Pal, but he preferred Tinners Way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eddie's the right guy to have in these million-dollar races," Frankel said. 
"He never panics. When Best Pal moved, Eddie also moved, and then we just 
outgained him in the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 This was Delahoussaye's ninth victory in a million-dollar race. "Bobby told me 
that this horse has one good spurt," Delahoussaye said. "Not a long one, but a 
good one. At the three-eighths pole, I had to go with my horse, because Best 
Pal came to me. It was a premature move, but I didn't have much choice. I had 
to go or I was going to get trapped." 
</P>
<P>
 Bred and owned by Prince Khalid Abdullah, a Saudi Arabian whose five breeding 
farms include 1,800 acres in Lexington, Ky., Tinners Way went off as the sixth 
betting choice and paid $16.20 while earning $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Tinners Way, trained by John Gosden in Europe before being sent late last year 
to Frankel, the prince's principal trainer in the United States, has raced 
mostly on dirt here. His only victory in the United States came in the 
Budweiser Breeders' Cup Handicap at Golden Gate Fields on June 25, and since 
then he was beaten by a neck by Region in the Bel Air Handicap at Hollywood 
Park on July 17. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tinners Way finished seventh in the Strub Stakes at Santa Anita in 
February, Frankel said that he would win the Pacific Classic. "I don't know why 
I picked out this race, I just did," Frankel said Saturday. "Then I walked 
around the rest of this year, without a clue. He's been an unlucky horse. He 
should have won the last time out. I thought that if there was a hot pace, 
Bertrando would be in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 With Slew Of Damascus, the Hollywood Gold Cup winner, pushing Bertrando from 
the start, the punishing fractions of 21 3/5 and 44 2/5 also indicated to John 
Shirreffs, Bertrando's trainer, and the crowd of 27,000 that there was trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was only the horse's second race back (after a season at stud), and the 
pace was too much," Shirreffs said. "Slew of Damascus was right there with us, 
and we never got a breather." 
</P>
<P>
 After Slew Of Damascus left Bertrando behind on the far turn, he then had to 
contend with Best Pal's entrymate, Dramatic Gold. After three-quarters of a 
mile, Tinners Way was sixth, six lengths off the lead and still in front of 
Best Pal by a half-length. At the quarter pole, Dramatic Gold edged ahead, with 
Tinners Way and Best Pal launching their bids. Best Pal, ridden by Chris 
McCarron, led for a stride or two at the top of the stretch before Tinners Way 
went by him. 
</P>
<P>
 Dramatic Gold finished third, 4 1/2 lengths behind Best Pal and 5 1/2 in front 
of Slew Of Damascus. Bertrando was beaten by 34 lengths. The first two 
finishers carried 124 pounds and Dramatic Gold, a 3-year-old, ran under 117 
pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Valenzuela, Bertrando's jockey, recited the fractional times that spelled 
defeat for his horse. "Twenty-one (seconds)," he said. "Forty-four. How can you 
do that and keep on going? You can't. And he didn't. Too fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Roberts, Slew Of Damascus' trainer, predicted such a pace would nullify 
the bids of both Bertrando and his horse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew what was going to happen," said Gary Stevens, who rode Slew Of 
Damascus. "I saw it happening. I felt it happening. But there wasn't a thing I 
could do about it. He and Bertrando are the same kind of horse. They both don't 
want another horse in front of them. There wasn't anything I could do. He was 
going to go and I couldn't stop him." 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal won the first Pacific Classic, in 1991, and was third last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Mandella, Best Pal's trainer, joked that Bertrando and Slew Of 
Damascus didn't run fast enough. "The winner's a good horse," Mandella said. 
"He's the 'now' horse, and he's at the top of his game. That's a tough 
combination, a good horse and Frankel training him. I'm getting sick of looking 
at Frankel." Horse Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal's $200,000 purse increased his total to $4.9 million, moving him 
ahead of Sunday Silence and Easy Goer on the earnings list. Ahead of the 
6-year-old gelding are Alysheba with $6.9 million and John Henry with $6.5 
million. . . . Eddie Delahoussaye also won Saturday's other stake, this time 
with a front-running ride on Desert Stormer in the $100,000 Rancho Bernardo 
Breeders' Cup Handicap. Desert Stormer, 9-1 while winning her first stake for 
trainer Fabio Nor, finished two lengths ahead of the favorite, Magical Maiden, 
making her first 1994 start.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Garfield Community Adult School will be one of several training sites in Los 
Angeles for AmeriCorps, President Clinton's national service program, which 
pays for college tuition in exchange for community service. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is accepting applications for eight AmeriCorps participants who 
will work in the school's Child Development Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents enrolled in the adult school for job training or to complete their 
high school diplomas can enroll their 2- to 5-year-old children at the center. 
The center runs a program for parents and children to learn together during 
playtime and lunch. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting," said Principal Dolores Diaz-Carrey. "We will be able to staff 
the three rooms in the child-care center with one or two of the other aides and 
have at least three or four adults in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 The school would not have been able to hire the additional staff without 
AmeriCorps, which awarded the school $80,000 to run the program beginning Sept. 
12, Diaz-Carrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Members selected for the positions will receive insurance coverage and minimum 
wage, about $170 for a 40-hour work week, which includes 30 hours of work in 
the center and 10 hours of instruction. After 1,700 hours, or about 43 weeks, 
they will receive $4,725, which will be paid to a college or vocational 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Applicants may apply at the Garfield Community Adult School, 831 N. Bonnie 
Beach Place before Friday or call (213) 264-4057 or (800) 94A-CORPS. MARY ANNE

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: BELL GARDENS; TOP POKER FACES ARE AT CLUB FOR 
TOURNEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Attracting the world's best poker players to a tournament outside Nevada or 
Atlantic City, N.J., would have been unheard of a decade ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the prominence of the Southland's card casinos, some of the nation's 
best card sharks convened last week at the Bicycle Club Casino for California's 
largest poker tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get the cream of the crop in here," Robert Turner, 46, one of the Bicycle 
Club's house pros, said of this year's poker talent. "Poker tourneys like this 
one just keep on expanding within the overall gaming business." 
</P>
<P>
 This month 300 seasoned poker veterans and some newcomers will pay $500 entry 
fees to compete for hundreds of thousands of dollars in prize money and a 
luxury automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Buy-ins, or the amount of money required to play in each day's event, range 
from $300 to $5,000. The tournament winner will be determined Aug. 31 by a 
tally of playoff points given to the winners of lowball, limit hold 'em and 
seven-card stud. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the poker god wills it, I'll win," said Men (The Master) Nguyen, a 
tournament favorite. Nguyen, 39, said he usually sticks to the professional 
circuit in Las Vegas, but made sure to enter the 10-year-old Bicycle Club 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the flashier professionals on the circuit, Nguyen said he spent 
$200,000 in prize money last year to rebuild a Buddhist temple in his native 
Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 His secret to consistent winning: "You create a game in your mind and use your 
own technique. It's all concentration, mind over matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Some participants said their concentration was ruined by the tournament's new 
ban on smoking. For those wishing to take a smoking break, the casino made a 
smoking lounge available. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's tournament winner, Todd Brunson of Las Vegas, pocketed $110,800.

 Students who live too far from a state university to attend or those who just 
want to study from home may now earn a master's degree in business from their 
living rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Dominguez Hills will start a program this fall that allows students 
to watch TV broadcasts of all 15 classes required for a master's degree in 
business administration.

<P>
 Classes will be taught at the Carson campus, and some students will attend the 
weekend lectures.  
</P>
<P>
 Students watching at home will be able to consult instructors by telephone and 
to submit course work by modem. 
</P>
<P>
 The first two classes will be "Business Economics" and "Finance and Business 
Management and Marketing." 
</P>
<P>
 Every seven weeks, students will gather at the Dominguez Hills campus to meet 
with instructors and other students. 
</P>
<P>
 The cost for the program is $199 per unit. School officials estimate it will 
take most students 2 1/2 years to complete the 45-unit degree.

LOS ANGELES HIGH SCHOOL SCORES A NEW HEAD COACH; PREP SPORTS: KAREEM GURGIS, 
FORMER WESTCHESTER HIGH ASSISTANT BASKETBALL COACH, DEBUTS THIS FALL. HE 
REPLACES CRAIG MURRAY, WHO RETURNS TO COLLEGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Westchester High assistant basketball coach Kareem Gurgis will make his 
head coaching debut this fall at Los Angeles High. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was offered a teaching position at Los Angeles and then I found out about 
the (coaching) vacancy and was offered the job," said Gurgis, who served as a 
two-year assistant under Coach Ed Azzam. 
</P>
<P>
 Gurgis will replace Craig Murray, who resigned at the end of last season 
because his love of coaching proved secondary to his love of teaching: "I want 
to go back to school at Cal State Los Angeles to get my master's degree in 
education," Murray said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gurgis said that working with Azzam has prepared him to be a head coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Azzam) is one of the best coaches in the City," Gurgis said. "They have a 
tremendous program at Westchester." 
</P>
<P>
 It will take some time and work before Gurgis can say the same about Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of talent here that needs cultivating," Gurgis said. "It's a 
good nucleus of kids who are willing to put out the effort." 
</P>
<P>
 Gurgis expects a smooth transition from assistant to coach, saying: "I was in 
charge of many of the practices at Westchester, so I know how to run a team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to help Ed out during games but he always had the final say. Now, I 
make all the changes and game preparations," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 During Murray's two-year coaching tenure, Los Angeles had a 21-27 record and 
made the playoffs last season, losing to Crenshaw, the eventual State Division 
I-A and City Section 4-A Division champion, in the first round of the City 
playoffs. 
</P>

 Arizona State heads a list of college basketball programs recruiting Jordan's 
Clem Breedlove. 
</P>
<P>
 Breedlove, who averaged 20 points for the Bulldogs last season, impressed 
college recruiters during a spring development league. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative from Arizona State contacted Breedlove last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "That surprised me because he didn't play in any of the big summer high school 
tournaments," Jordan Coach Ed Kamiyama said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if Clem will get much taller, so he needs to work on his upper 
body and build up his legs." 
</P>
<P>
 If Breedlove does well on his SAT, Cal State Los Angeles, Cal State Dominguez 
and Azusa Pacific are among his top choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Breedlove was a member of the 1994 City Times All-Stars second team. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw's three-point shooting specialist Ronnie Arch is expected to take 
fall recruiting visits to USC, Syracuse, Connecticut, Florida State and Cal in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-5, 174-pound shooting guard will be one of the Cougars' primary weapons 
after the graduation of five senior starters. 
</P>
<P>
 If Arch's play this summer has been any indication, he may be the Central 
City's next superstar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ronnie played very well and is only going to get better," said Dana Pump, 
co-sponsor of the July 9-12 West Coast All-Star Camp at Cal State Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
 Arch, who is primarily a spot-up shooter, needs to work on shooting off the 
dribble and creating shots. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Washington guard Patrick Blake lists Arizona State, Illinois State, Colorado 
and Loyola Marymount as schools he will visit during his fall recruiting trips. 
</P>
<P>
 Blake, who is 6-3, 180 pounds, has good size and an outstanding stroke for a 
shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the top three-point shooters in the area, Blake was the perfect outside 
complement to Dayron Harris' inside-power game last season. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Some of the area's better players, such as Fremont's Antonio Hines and Thomas 
Hildreth, will use the upcoming season to impress Division I scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hines, a 6-3 guard-forward, has no plans yet, but will probably sign in late 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Antonio has great grades," Fremont Coach Sam Sullivan said. "He is a good 
shooter and leaper, but needs to bulk up. Antonio will be one of Fremont's 
go-to guys." 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-2 Hildreth is a slashing-type player going to the basket but has an 
inconsistent jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thomas is a scrappy player that defends well and gets 12 to 14 points every 
game," Sullivan said.

NOTEBOOK; A SOCCER TITLE -- AT LAST -- FOR GARFIELD

<P>
 The Garfield High boys' soccer team defeated Bosco Tech, 2-1, July 27 in the 
final of the inaugural Bosco Tech Summer Cup in Rosemead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Bulldogs' most satisfying victory no doubt was a 1-0 victory over 
Belmont in their semifinal match on a goal by Javier Romero. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sentinels beat Garfield in round-robin competition earlier in the six-team 
tournament. In February, Belmont beat Garfield in overtime in the City Section 
quarterfinals, handing the Bulldogs their only defeat of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Belmont went on to beat Bell in the City final but was stripped of its title 
for using an ineligible player. The title wasn't awarded to anyone because the 
violation was discovered after the season. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Garfield (9-0-3), Bell and San Pedro each earned the dubious 
distinction of finishing the season undefeated without a City title. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a double-edged blade for us as well as them," Garfield Coach Gerardo 
Campos said. "It was tough for us and I felt bad for them. We left this 
tournament with a good feeling, but it should be a close and interesting 
season." 
</P>
<P>
 Juan Robles and Jesus Mata, who are among eight returning players for 
Garfield, each scored goals in the final of the Bosco Tech tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerardo Gomez, Mando Morales, Oscar Fuentes, Dennis Valladares and Juan 
Herrera are other returnees for Garfield, which notched victories over Bishop 
Amat and St. Paul, and tied Lincoln in tournament play.  
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Yolanda Gomez of Belmont High, who finished second in the 1992 City Section 
cross-country finals, will attend Pepperdine University, choosing the Waves 
over Fresno State and College of Notre Dame in Northern California. The Malibu 
school has a cross-country program but track is only offered as a club sport. 
But Gomez, whose brother Roman was a two-time state champion in the 1,600 and 
3,200 meters at Belmont, said proximity and a preference for cross-country over 
track were determining factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Soliz of Cal State L.A., a 1993 Cleveland Indians 13th-round draft pick, 
has been promoted from Class-A Kinston to the Indians' affiliate at 
Akron-Canton in the double-A Eastern League. Soliz batted .264 with three home 
runs and 19 runs batted in 51 games. He also played in the Carolina League 
all-star game for the Southern Division last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback David Guerra and lineman Marco Aguirre, who helped Garfield High 
to the Southeastern Conference title, will attend Mt. San Antonio College. 
Lineman Eddie Pasillas and linebacker Manuel Rodriguez of Garfield will play 
for Redlands, an NCAA Division III school.

A REASON TO CELEBRATE; BLYTHE STREET: RESIDENTS HOLD A FESTIVAL, PROMISING A 
NEW ERA IN THE CRIME-RIDDEN NEIGHBORHOOD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Children ran around the park spraying their faces with water, couples danced 
to ranchera music and neighbors lined up for a plate of tamales, rice and beans 
at Vecino a Vecino , a neighborhood celebration Saturday on Blythe Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Long known as one of the most notorious streets in the San Fernando Valley for 
its gang-controlled drug trade and violence, residents of the low-income and 
mostly Latino neighborhood gathered to mark what they believe is a new era. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the beginning of people in this area being able to say what they 
think needs to be done," said Margaret-Rose Welch, a member of the Immaculate 
Heart Community, a religious society of lay people who have acted as advocates 
for the residents for a year and a half. The group uses federal and local 
grants to improve the residents' way of life. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 100 people celebrated at a vacant lot converted into a park 
Saturday. Gone was the graffiti and garbage that once lined the street. And 
participants witnessed a rare sight on Blythe Street: a Los Angeles police 
officer mingling peacefully with a few local gang members, who had offered 
their services as security at Vecino a Vecino , or Neighbor to Neighbor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is like a little village here," Welch said. "The spirit of the 
street is amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of Welch's group, which seceded from an order of Roman Catholic 
nuns 24 years ago, residents have slowly begun to empower themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Immaculate Heart Community began working on Blythe Street last year and 
now rents five units at Casa Esperanza, a run-down apartment house in the 
middle of the block, where English, parenting and religion classes are held. 
The group also tutors children, communicates with local gang members and 
demands that help promised from community organizations is actually delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the people to change the condition of their lives here," said Welch, 
who directs the revitalization project. "There is a lot of natural leadership 
here and we just want to mobilize it." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last four months, the San Fernando Valley Partnership and Friday Night 
Live, two community groups that work to stop drug and alcohol abuse, have 
tapped into that leadership and organized the younger residents of Blythe 
Street to plan carwashes, softball games and Saturday's celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is something special," said Esmeralda Virgen, 14, of the Friday 
Night Live events. "All of us (in the leadership group) get along well. We 
communicate and learn how to respond to each other." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a great way for neighbors to meet each other," said Albert Melena, head 
of the Blythe Street Leadership/Friday Night Live group, which has 50 members. 
"A lot of people who live here don't even know each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The Immaculate Heart Community is also administering a $20,000 college 
scholarship fund in the name of Donald Aragon, a Blythe Street apartment owner 
who was slain by local gang members more than two years ago. The fund was 
created for high school graduates by a donation from the Anheuser-Busch 
Foundation. Aragon was an Anheuser-Busch employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Immaculate Heart Community members say they are also in negotiations with the 
Los Angeles Unified School District to open up an alternative education and 
youth center at the Casa Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the gang members wanted to get their high school diploma," said 
Welch, 69, who has an extensive background in counseling and educational 
administration. "It is hard to get some of them to go down the block to go to 
school." 
</P>
<P>
 Only a few gang members have joined the classes and participated in leadership 
events, but most approve of the Immaculate Heart Community's work. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first kind of (celebration) we ever had here," said Jose 
Midrigal, 21, a member of the local gang. "It is good for all the people, and 
my homeboys don't have a problem with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Midrigal said although he has noticed positive changes in the neighborhood, he 
still resents a city injunction that prohibits gang members from loitering in 
the area. "The cops still harass us," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police officers have also warned Welch and others against communicating with 
some of the hard-core gang members. But Welch believes that they, too, need 
help and that the Immaculate Heart Community can provide it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think we don't know how to work with gangs," said Welch. "We know it is 
a delicate balance, but it can be done."

3 DIE WHEN FIREFIGHTING PLANE EXPLODES IN MIDAIR; BLAZE: C-130, WHICH WAS 
CARRYING RETARDANT, BREAKS UP INTO DOZENS OF PIECES. THE BODIES WILL BE 
RETRIEVED TODAY.

 A C-130 firefighting aircraft on its way to fight a blaze in Kern County 
exploded in midair Saturday, killing three people on board and sending a huge 
fireball vaulting into the sky after the plane crashed in rugged canyon 
country, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft, which was carrying fire retardant, broke off into dozens of 
pieces and sparked two small brush fires on the side of Pallet Mountain, about 
25 miles south of Palmdale in the Angeles National Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 The fires blackened about five acres and were contained by U.S. Forest Service 
and Los Angeles County Fire Department crews by late Saturday, fire officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Forest Service spokesman said rescuers will retrieve the bodies today. 
Spokesman Terry Ellis said the three were employees of the Hemet Valley Flying 
Service, which owned the plane and contracted it out to the Forest Service to 
help combat fires. The plane had taken off from the Hemet airport and was on 
its way to Kern County. 
</P>
<P>
 Also today, National Transportation Safety Board investigators will hike to 
the crash site to try to determine the cause of the crash, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to be a mountain climber to get up there," said Los Angeles County 
Sheriff's Lt. Antonio Madrid, who was at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, authorities believed two planes had collided in midair because of 
the explosion and two brush fires. But, Madrid said, the plane "apparently 
caught on fire before it crashed . . . We now believe the plane was cut in 
half." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Edwards Air Force Base said that its control tower was 
tracking the plane and that it disappeared from the radar screen about 1:30 
p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane, a privately owned C-130 Hercules, was being leased by the U. S. 
Forest Service to help fight fires throughout the country, said Roger 
Richcreek, a Forest Service spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Details about the crash were sketchy Saturday evening, but witnesses said the 
plane lost altitude and exploded before it slammed into the mountainside near 
Devil's Punch Bowl, a Los Angeles County park known for its unusual rock 
formations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were driving up when we noticed this large plane that seemed to be flying 
too low," said Sheri Multer of Fontana, who was in the area with her daughter 
and nephew. "It just exploded into a ball of flames. One of the wings shot off 
and the body of the plane kept flying off. . . . I feel sorry for whoever was 
in the plane." 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Hogan, 68, who was part of a foursome golfing at Crystalaire Country 
Club in nearby Llano, said that as he was coming up the ninth fairway, he 
noticed the plane was on fire and tumbling through the air. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had flames shooting out of it, and making a sputtering sound," he said. "I 
knew it was going down. I told my playing partners. Then I saw and heard a huge 
explosion. It was a huge ball of flame and smoke that probably went 500 feet 
into the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Several seconds after the first explosion, Hogan said, he saw the aircraft 
slam into the mountainside, and heard another crashing sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen anything like this in my life," he said. "It was louder than 
a sonic boom. It was awesome." 
</P>
<P>
 David Sandoval of Carson City, Nev., said he was on his way with a friend to 
Devil's Punch Bowl when the friend, who was driving, pointed out the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "I stuck my head out the window," Sandoval said. "I saw this flash and 
explosion. It blew the left wing off. The fuselage then tumbled down into the 
mountains."  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't see any parachutes," Sandoval added. "Whoever was in that plane went 
down with it. It happened so fast I don't think even the pilot knew what was 
happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 30 planes leased by the Forest Service are C-130 cargo planes 
converted to carry fire-retardant chemicals, officials said Saturday. The 
planes carry a maximum of three passengers, including the pilot. 
</P>
<P>
 The so-called air tankers are very effective at fighting fires because they 
can fly at fairly slow speeds, are highly maneuverable and are able to drop 
fire retardant with dead-on accuracy, said Richcreek. 
</P>
<P>
 During fire season, the planes roam the country, going from one blaze to 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 The C-130 that went down Saturday was en route to a brush fire in central Kern 
County believed to have been started by lightning. Officials did not know where 
the flight had originated. The Northrop fire, which burned 75 acres, was 
contained Saturday afternoon, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightning has ignited dozens of such fires on the desert side of the Angeles 
National Forest over the last three days. 
</P>
<P>
 While the tanker planes handle air-traffic control themselves, they usually 
check in with local Forest Service crews when they arrive at a fire, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Richcreek said he did not know whether the plane that went down Saturday had 
attempted to communicate with Angeles National Forest rangers because of the 
heavy radio traffic generated by the recent brush fires. 
</P>
<P>
 After the crash, Los Angeles County Sheriff's deputies cordoned off the area, 
and helicopters dropped retardant to control the fires sparked by the crash. 
Firefighting Mission 
</P>
<P>
 A private plane leased by the U.S. Forest Service for firefighting purposes 
crashed in the Los Angeles National Forest about 1:30 p.m. Saturday. The plane 
was carrying fire retardant to help combat a brush fire in Kern County. The 
airplane is used by the Forest Service for carrying and dropping fire-retardant 
chemicals.

RADAR GUN LAW TRIGGERING HIKES IN SPEED LIMITS; SAFETY: RULE FOCUSES ON 
PREVAILING TRAFFIC PACE. IT'S TOUGH TO DEFEND AND MADDENING FOR RESIDENTS 
WORRIED ABOUT SPEEDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Randy Overholt has witnessed several accidents on the corner near his Porter 
Ranch home, including one that ended with a truck careening through the shrubs 
of his front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 So it seemed to defy logic when city workers last year replaced the 25 m.p.h. 
speed limit signs on his street -- Vanalden Avenue between Wilbur Avenue and 
Devonshire Street -- with 30 m.p.h. signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are literally doing freeway speeds," he said, only moments after 
shouting at a car squealing past his house. "I yell at them because they go so 
fast that they can't stop for a child." 
</P>
<P>
 The increase on Overholt's street is the result of a 1972 state law that says 
that in order for police to use radar guns to catch speeders, posted speed 
limits must reflect prevailing traffic speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1991, this has led the city of Los Angeles to increase limits on at 
least 55 streets while lowering the limit on only five, according to a review 
of city records. 
</P>
<P>
 Such increases have perturbed Councilman Hal Bernson, who last year persuaded 
the City Council to ask state lawmakers to change the law so that speeds can be 
set 15 m.p.h. below prevailing speeds. 
</P>
<P>
 In his motion, Bernson said the speeds traveled on surface streets are rising 
faster because commuters are increasingly using streets as alternatives to 
freeways and major thoroughfares. The state has not yet acted on that request. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the increases usually only raise the limit 5 m.p.h. -- most commonly 
from 25 to 30 m.p.h. -- it is a maddening policy for residents already upset 
about motorists speeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is like a raceway," said Pier Spaccia, who has lived across the 
street from Overholt, in an otherwise quiet residential area, for two years. 
The fear of speeders has prevented Spaccia from letting his five children play 
in the street or even on the sidewalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Spaccia didn't realize the speed limit had been increased, but said it didn't 
make sense to him. "Whenever you raise the limit, they are going to go 10 
m.p.h. over the limit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and city traffic engineers say it is a sensible law that isn't always 
easy to defend, especially to those demanding that something be done about 
speeders. The increases in speed, they say, are the reasonable cost of using 
radar. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a real difficult thing to explain to the citizen groups," said James H. 
Sherman, the city traffic engineer who approves such increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Police Officer Chuck Massar, who runs the classes that teach LAPD 
officers to use radar guns, also knows how difficult it can be to sell 
residents on the benefits of this seemingly illogical policy. 
</P>
<P>
 He recalls that a few years ago a hillside neighborhood fought for two years a 
plan to increase the speed limit on a road from 25 to 30 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute was so contentious that even today Massar said he would rather not 
name the neighborhood for fear of sparking further debate. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the law's defense, he said, once the increase was in place, police were 
able to enforce the limit with radar and "lo and behold, they found that we 
enforced it very tightly." 
</P>
<P>
 The law was designed to make sure cities and police do not conspire to set up 
"speed traps" where radar-packing cops take cover along streets with 
artificially low speed limits and rake in the fines. 
</P>
<P>
 The process usually begins with a complaint: a resident or business owner asks 
police to crack down on speeders on a city street. To ensure that speed limits 
are fair, the city must conduct a survey of traffic speeds during the past five 
years before police are allowed to use radar to enforce the posted limit. 
</P>
<P>
 To conduct a survey, transportation officials sit in unmarked cars during the 
lunch hour on weekdays and use radar guns to measure the speed of passing 
traffic. The speed limit is then set within 5 m.p.h. of the speed driven by 85% 
of drivers, under the assumption that 85% of motorists drive safely. 
</P>
<P>
 If they want to use radar, cities cannot set the limit lower than the flow of 
traffic unless it is warranted by such road conditions as narrow or curved 
lanes or high pedestrian traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 The city could avoid conducting surveys and thus eliminate the chances of 
increasing the speed limit by simply halting the use of radar guns. But police 
say radar is the most accurate and safest way to gauge speeds. The only other 
alternatives police have for tracking speeders are visual estimation -- a 
method that can be flawed and challenged in court -- or following the speeding 
car, which increases the chance of an accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Massar said the surveys allow police to use radar on more streets. Today, 
radar is used on more than 500 streets in Los Angeles, up from only 88 streets 
in 1983, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents who live on streets where the limits have been increased 
say they haven't noticed greater enforcement of speed laws since the new 
speed-limit signs went up. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Ford lives on a section of Budlong Avenue near USC, where the city last 
year increased the speed limit from 25 to 30 m.p.h. But he says it seems that 
speeders hardly ever are cited on his street. 
</P>
<P>
 "They drive like it's a runway here," he said. "I wish they would enforce it. 
There is a school right around the corner, too." 
</P>
<P>
 In the next month or so, the City Council is expected to increase the speed 
limit from 35 to 40 m.p.h. on Hayvenhurst Avenue in Encino, between Burbank and 
Ventura boulevards. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents on that street say traffic already whizzes by so fast they 
can barely get out of their driveways in the morning. An increase in the limit, 
they say, will only make matters worse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hate this street, I really hate it," said Maxine Easton, who has lived on 
Hayvenhurst for 29 years. She suggested the city reduce the speed limit -- not 
increase it -- and install a traffic signal on a troublesome nearby 
intersection. 
</P>
<P>
 Easton's neighbor, Sabina Gram, who has lived on Hayvenhurst for 41 years, has 
a more drastic solution: "Tell them to close it down." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everyone agrees that faster speeds lead to more problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Baxter, president of the National Motorists Assn. -- a Wisconsin-based 
motorists rights group that was instrumental in increasing rural highway speed 
limits to 65 m.p.h. -- said allowing the prevailing traffic speeds to decide 
the limits is fair because most motorists drive safely. 
</P>
<P>
 "Studies show that posting speed limits at the 85% level will result in the 
maximum safety benefit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Baxter said setting speed limits that are too slow can cause 
accidents because faster motorists try to pass up slower automobiles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The vast majority of people who get in their cars do not want to hurt 
anybody. They drive safely," he said. "The source of aggravation (for 
residents) are those who grossly exceed the speed limit." Up to Speed

<P>
 Wow, man, it's time to correct a major historical injustice. 
</P>
<P>
 All these East Coast intellectual types are talking about some music festival 
we don't even remember when a far more mind-blowing festival happened right 
here in our own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Dig it: 200,000 people got together in June of '69 for peace and love, and the 
weirdest thing was, they got together at Devonshire Downs in Northridge, man. 
</P>
<P>
 It really happened! And Northridge in '69 was kind of like the moon -- there 
was nothing much there: a barren, desolate landscape, sort of like the brain of 
Howie Mandel. 
</P>
<P>
 But greatness happened there. Try to imagine Jimi Hendrix and Three Dog Night 
on the same stage. It really happened! It covered the waterfront, you know what 
we mean? Name us another concert that would feature Janis Joplin and The Grass 
Roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days. Two-dozen bands. Two hundred thousand people: the biggest concert 
in the history of rock 'n' roll, and you can look it up. Before Northridge, the 
biggest festival anybody had ever seen was 99,000 people in Miami. This crushed 
it, man, and now nobody remembers it. 
</P>
<P>
 But we do. 
</P>
<P>
 Who could forget the sight of that woman in the pink tank top -- we see these 
TV ads for Dianne Feinstein, and we swear it was really her -- on the PA 
system, warning people not to taste the brown acid?  
</P>
<P>
 We think we saw Wally George with his real hair. 
</P>
<P>
 We think we saw 75,000 people -- the Northridge Nation -- rise up on that 
Saturday when Jimi hit the first chord to "Voodoo Chile (Slight Return)."  
</P>
<P>
 It had everything, man. It had cops, heat, dirt, dust -- real dust, man, not 
angel dust . . . although, come to think of it, it had that, too. And one more 
thing: Elvis was alive back then. Nobody had to dream about seeing him in a 
market in Grand Rapids. He was alive! He just wasn't there.  
</P>
<P>
 It was so cool, man, that after the second day, Joni Mitchell calls Eric 
Burden from a phone booth in Canada and reads him this song she wrote on the 
back of a Pez candy wrapper and tells him: "Eric, you gotta sing this tomorrow, 
bro'. Give it to the people." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, in front of 110,000 sweltering, wild-eyed, tie-dyed souls, there 
was Eric, singing the original version of the song that later would become 
famous: 
</P>
<P>
 We are stardust  
</P>
<P>
 We are golden  
</P>
<P>
 Kitty-corner to an alley  
</P>
<P>
 And we got to get ourselves out of the Valley  
</P>
<P>
 So, like, now we're supposed to pay our cable company $49 to watch a 25-year 
tribute to Woodstock on pay-per-view TV. Why? We have our own festival to 
remember. Why isn't there a 25-year tribute to Devonshire Downs? 
</P>
<P>
 Hey! We got it. Today, let's do it! Let's everybody meet, corner of Devonshire 
and Zelzah. We'll get Eric, Joni, Jimi, two of the guys from Three Dog Night, 
Chambers Brothers, Tricia Toyota. This was our generation's moment, man, and 
you know what they say about those who forget history. We wish we did. Too much 
brown acid. Well, maybe you can tell us when we see you later. 
</P>

 (The Northridge festival, called Newport '69, took place over three days the 
weekend of June 20, 1969, two months before Woodstock. It made national 
headlines because of a melee that broke out the last day, but was quickly 
forgotten.)

CRENSHAW DISTRICT AGENCY AT EPICENTER OF QUAKE RECOVERY EFFORTS; AFTERMATH: THE 
SERVICE CENTER IS THE BUSIEST IN THE SOUTHLAND. MOST CLIENTS ARE ELDERLY 
RESIDENTS WHO WERE SLOW TO DISCOVER DAMAGE OR WARY OF LOAN PROCESS.

<P>
 Almost seven months after the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake rocked the city 
out of early morning sleep, many residents are still waking up to the temblor's 
devastating effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the San Fernando Valley has received the lion's share of media and 
government attention, the earthquake assistance center set up in the Crenshaw 
district is the busiest in the Southland. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike their Valley counterparts, many quake victims seeking assistance at the 
Crenshaw center waited much longer to enlist governmental help because they 
were unsure if they qualified for aid, according to spokeswoman Lisa Posey of 
the Crenshaw Earthquake Service Center, 3420 W. Jefferson Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was reluctant to come in because I just figured I wouldn't get anything," 
said Maurice Prince, who came to the center to apply for money to repair damage 
to her Mid-City restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "I closed for one day after the earthquake, but had to keep going. . . . I 
just got busy. An outreach person here told me that I should come down, so I 
finally did." 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 10 government assistance centers that opened in Los Angeles and Ventura 
counties after the magnitude-6.8 quake, Posey said the Crenshaw location -- the 
only one south of the Santa Monica Freeway -- has processed the most 
applications for aid: 6,726, compared to 4,101 at the Sylmar center. A total of 
27,401 applications have been processed so far. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crenshaw center has seen about 40,000 clients and is still averaging about 
25 applications for aid per day, Posey said. The daily number of walk-ins, 
including new and repeat clients, frequently tops 190 renters, and home and 
business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 The complex, the former site of a Muslim school, houses not only the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency and the state Office of Emergency Services but 
several Los Angeles city and county agencies, including the county Mental 
Health, Employment Development and Aging Services departments. 
</P>
<P>
 The bulk of clients, said Office of Emergency Services Manager Floyd Godfrey, 
are elderly residents who were slow to discover damage or were wary of applying 
for government loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Abbie Deverges, a Crenshaw homeowner since 1950, said she was reluctant to get 
caught up in red tape, though her home suffered extensive damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did get a grant for $4,000, but that didn't cover everything," said 
Deverges, a retiree who was filing an appeal at the center for additional aid. 
"I had to use a lot of my own money to fix things. I need to replace all my 
damaged windows before the rains come." 
</P>
<P>
 She said she used most of the grant money to repair deep cracks and crumbled 
stucco in her living room, dining room and bedroom walls, and she estimates it 
will take an additional $3,000 to repair similar damage outside. 
</P>
<P>
 Godfrey said most of the clients are living on small incomes and cannot absorb 
much of a loss. The federal and state aid includes grants of up to $22,200 and 
loans for quake-related structural repairs for property owners and personal 
losses for both property owners and renters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hardest thing is that though we can help people, it doesn't really 
compensate them, especially homeowners," he said. "You can go anywhere right 
around here, down Bronson Avenue, and find about 10 or 15 houses off their 
foundations. There's only so much we can do." 
</P>
<P>
 But the center, and others like it, will be helping people longer than 
expected: The federal government recently extended the deadline to apply for 
assistance to Sept. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the third time the cutoff date has been extended. With the amount of 
foot traffic the center is still getting, and the follow-up that must be done, 
Godfrey said the Crenshaw center will keep its doors open at least until 
Christmas. "As long as we're needed, we'll be here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center also offers ongoing earthquake preparedness and damage reduction 
workshops. It is open Monday through Saturday, 9 a.m. to 6 p.m.

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man was killed after he was struck by three cars on the westbound Ventura 
Freeway in Agoura Hills early Saturday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old man was walking on the freeway west of the Liberty Canyon Road 
exit about 2 a.m. when he was hit by a car going about 55 m.p.h. said Officer 
Bruce Ferrier of the California Highway Patrol.The car then spun out and hit 
the center divider, he said. The victim was knocked to the ground where he was 
hit by two more cars, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 No one else was injured. All lanes of the westbound freeway were closed for 
more than three hours, Ferrier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics pronounced the man dead at the scene. His name was withheld pending 
notification of relatives.

<P>
 Power outages struck parts of Agoura and Calabasas on Saturday after Southern 
California Edison Co. recorded a peak amount of power usage in the third day of 
record high temperatures. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6:49 p.m., Edison started receiving calls from residents reporting outages, 
said Trish Edmunds, a spokeswoman for Southern California Edison. Power was 
expected to resume for most customers by 11 p.m.  
</P>
<P>
 "We know that circuits are blowing because of an increase in usage in all 
types of power, mostly air conditioners," said Edmunds. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday afternoon, 16,441 megawatts of power were being used in the 
Southern California area, the highest amount recorded for a weekend day since 
1992, Edmunds said.

 A dispute between neighbors in a Lancaster apartment building turned deadly 
Friday night, resulting in the fatal shooting of one man and the wounding of 
another, authorities said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Lopez Rodriguez, 29, and Edward Valenzuela, 45, were shot about 8:30 
p.m. at their apartment in the 1700 block of Park Circle Drive.Los Angeles 
County sheriff's detectives believe Rodriguez was killed as he stood in the 
doorway of the apartment. He was hit at least once in the upper body and died 
at the scene, Deputy Benita Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Valenzuela received a flesh wound to his upper body as he stood on a walkway 
just outside the apartment. He was in good condition at Antelope Valley Medical 
Center, Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Homicide detectives are seeking a neighbor of the two men, 20-year-old Armando 
Flores, in connection with the shootings. Flores is also known as Armando 
Avalos, Hinojos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives believe the shooting resulted from a longstanding feud between the 
victims, and Flores and his two brothers, Gabriel and Francisco Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 All three Flores brothers were last seen in a white Ford Escort, sheriff's 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 They added that the weapon used in the shooting is believed to have been a 
handgun. No gun has been recovered. JILL BETTNER

 Search and rescue teams from the Los Angeles and San Bernardino county 
sheriffs' departments located two hikers Saturday who had been missing for two 
days in the Wrightwood area of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies said rescue workers used four 
helicopters to locate Jason Anderson, 24, and Micah Willmott, 14, both of 
Victorville.The pair were spotted walking in the San Gabriel River bed about 
12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The hikers were tired, sore and hungry, but otherwise in apparently good 
condition, said Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputy D.J. Saenz. 
</P>
<P>
 However, as a precaution, they were taken by helicopter to the Mountain High 
Ski Area in Wrightwood to be examined by paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I understand it, Mr. Anderson was extremely proficient in survival 
training," Saenz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had that information going into the search, which made us feel a little 
better," he added. "How many times have we gone out on searches like this where 
people had no knowledge of what they were getting into?" 
</P>
<P>
 A relative of one of the hikers reported them missing Friday morning after 
they failed to return Thursday evening as planned. JILL BETTNER

FULLERTON FIGHTS ODDS TO KEEP HUGHES PLANT; JOBS: CITY TOUTS LOW TAX RATES AS 
GROUNDS FOR BIG EMPLOYER TO STAY, BUT ITS HIGH PROPERTY VALUES COULD BE 
DECIDING FACTOR TO LEAVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A week after Hughes Aircraft announced that it might close one of four defense 
electronics plants, including its Fullerton operation, a contingent of half a 
dozen leaders representing the city marched into Vice Chairman Michael Smith's 
office at Hughes' headquarters in Westchester, near Los Angeles International 
Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 There, Rep. Ed Royce (R-Fullerton) and Fullerton City Manager James L. 
Armstrong, among others, spread out on a table their analysis of the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's big advantage, they argued on that May day, was the city's 
significantly lower tax rates. For a 10,000-employee firm with 2 million square 
feet of office space, $4 million in annual utility bills and $1 billion in 
sales (parameters Hughes meets in Fullerton except with fewer employees), they 
said, the overall business license and utility taxes in Fullerton would cost 
just $90,000 a year, versus $455,000 in Long Beach and $1.9 million in El 
Segundo. 
</P>
<P>
 That, the Fullerton contingent reasoned, was a strong sales pitch. But as 
Hughes Aircraft Co. nears a decision on its facilities consolidation plan, 
there's a common feeling among public officials, real estate brokers, analysts 
and union representatives that tax advantages just won't be enough. The main 
reason: Hughes has extremely valuable real estate holdings in Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Hughes' two facilities in El Segundo and its smaller plant in Long 
Beach -- which are also being evaluated as part of the streamlining plan -- 
Hughes' 350-acre Fullerton site is totally owned by the corporation. It's very 
valuable and easily salable. 
</P>
<P>
 The impending consolidation is likely to have the biggest effect on El Segundo 
and Fullerton because the company's Long Beach center is a leased field support 
office with 970 workers. At Fullerton, Hughes produces ship-based radars, air 
traffic control equipment and large-scale air defense systems. The two El 
Segundo facilities make radars and electrical-optical devices such as sensors, 
and have a combined employment of about 7,800. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on property tax records, the Fullerton site's assessed value is $75 
million -- a figure real estate analysts say is conservative. Yet only 
two-thirds of its 3 million square feet of working space is being used because 
of diminished defense work; the remainder sits idle. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the company also has surplus space at its two complexes in El Segundo, 
which has a combined working space of 3.3 million square feet, it is not 
thought to be nearly as much. And one of the El Segundo plants is half the age 
of those at Fullerton, and the other in El Segundo is on a long-term lease. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mostly a real estate problem," acknowledged Fullerton Mayor A.B. (Buck) 
Catlin, who is a member of the so-called red team attempting to keep Hughes in 
Orange County. Catlin worked for Hughes in Fullerton in the early 1960s, a few 
years after it opened, and he has unhappily watched its employment dwindle to 
6,800 today from a high of 14,500 in 1986. Though Catlin said he doesn't think 
Hughes will abandon Fullerton, he and others fear more shrinkage of jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the kind of industry people would kill for," said Gary A. Chalupsky, 
director of Fullerton's Redevelopment Agency. Most of the nearly 7,000 jobs are 
white-collar, such as computer programming and engineering; the rest are 
manufacturing positions that pay up to $15 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyrum Fedje, director of planning and building safety for El Segundo, says he 
already sees indications that the Hughes consolidation will benefit his city. 
Last week , Fedje said, his staff was completing plan checks on an 
80,000-square-foot tenant improvement project by Hughes in El Segundo. That's a 
fraction of the more than 3 million square feet now there, but 
80,000-square-foot can still house 400 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The signs are that they're about to consolidate more and more people in El 
Segundo," Fedje said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes spokesmen at headquarters said they are unaware of this particular 
project, and stressed that no decision has yet been made. Company officials say 
consolidation recommendations are being studied by senior officials and that an 
announcement is expected later this month or in early September. Company 
officials have said the realignment is likely to result in job cuts of about 
3,400 -- or 10% of the company's overall employment in California. And the 
consolidation could affect other Hughes facilities, spokesmen said, even though 
the review is focusing on these four. 
</P>
<P>
 "There undoubtedly will be a reduction in the whole space," said Hughes 
spokesman Richard Dore, noting that cutting surplus space is a primary 
objective. 
</P>
<P>
 The four defense facilities being considered for streamlining are part of 
Hughes Aerospace & Electronics Co., a corporate division formed in March. The 
consolidation reflects the latest efforts by General Motors-owned Hughes to 
simplify its operations amid continued defense cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two years, Hughes has closed plants in Canoga Park and San Diego, 
among other places, in combining its missile operations in Tucson, and its 
profits have soared. In all, the company has pruned about 25% of its work force 
and cleared out of more than 100 buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes declines to specify how much of the 3.3 million square feet at El 
Segundo is unused. The Long Beach site encompasses three buildings with a total 
of 780,000 square feet, of which about 17% is vacant, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 While the company's facilities in Fullerton and El Segundo both have test 
facilities that would be difficult to uproot and transfer, much of their 
electronics operations are transferable. So neither site appears to have an 
edge in possessing key tooling or production equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kinds of things (defense electronics plants) make tend to be more 
portable than companies making large aircraft or missile structures," said John 
Harbison, who heads the aerospace practice at the Los Angeles consulting firm 
Booz Allen & Hamilton. "There is a common thread to what they do, and that is 
basic electronics." 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, there are certain programs at Fullerton that, if moved 
elsewhere during the production phase, could delay shipment. Perhaps the 
biggest project now at Fullerton is Hughes' $1-billion-plus Peace Shield 
contract to provide air defense systems for Saudi Arabia, which is scheduled to 
be delivered by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Hughes has said that its eventual consolidation would take 18 months to 
two years to complete, which would reduce the impact on such ongoing programs. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials at Fullerton and El Segundo say they are not in a bidding war 
and that Hughes has not asked either city to put offers on the table. But each 
knows the consolidation plan is a zero-sum game. 
</P>
<P>
 James W. Morrison, El Segundo's city manager, said the business license and 
utility tax calculations by the Fullerton representatives were "speculation." 
And he said El Segundo's City Council last month cut its business license tax 
by 10%. "Our overall tax package is competitive," he said, adding that the city 
has also recently streamlined the process for completing building plan checks 
so companies like Hughes could more quickly expand. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton's Armstrong, however, said Hughes executives were interested in the 
tax analysis. But he acknowledged: "These numbers, while I think they're 
significant, may not be to Hughes." 
</P>
<P>
 Chalupsky, head of the city's economic development and redevelopment office, 
said there are some intangible pluses for Fullerton, including its strong local 
work force and lifestyle values. Many Hughes engineers graduated from Cal State 
Fullerton, he said, and "we have a good old-fashioned, educated work force 
here" at the Fullerton plant. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike Hughes' earlier decision to move operations from Southern 
California to Tucson, analysts don't see the issue of work force locale as 
being major, because the four plants are all in the region. In fact, only about 
15% to 20% of the Hughes workers in Fullerton live in the city, according to 
Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chalupsky could think of only one negative for Fullerton, but it weighed 
heavily in his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of our strengths is a weakness in terms of Hughes," he said. "Fullerton 
is considered an excellent living environment. That will probably say to them 
(that) all that land they own is marketable." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, several real estate executives said they expect Hughes to abandon most 
or all of its Fullerton site precisely for that reason. Hughes is already in 
the process of getting a zoning change to sell off about 140 acres, about 40% 
of the total, to build houses and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Sattler, vice president of CB Commercial in Anaheim who specializes in 
industrial and commercial properties in Fullerton and a longtime resident 
there, said he can easily imagine the entire Hughes site being converted for 
residential use. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes' gated campus in Fullerton, which is made up of about 10 large office 
and industrial buildings, is surrounded by residential neighborhoods. "If that 
had been vacant land without Hughes (having moved there in 1957)," Sattler 
said, "it would be all residential now." 
</P>
<P>
 Sattler said it is possible Hughes could sell its Fullerton site for 
industrial use, especially with Orange County's non-residential real estate

others said its greatest value would be for residential use.

 Hughes workers in Fullerton and their representatives at the Carpenters Union 
worry that the temptation of big land sale profits will be too much for Hughes 
to resist. Office and blue-collar workers in Fullerton, speaking only on the 
condition that their names not be used, say they are bracing for the worst. 
Some workers in the plant, they say, have formed groups recently to help each 
other write resumes and prepare for new jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 During much of the summer, Hughes management has held hourlong forums on 
Fridays in a vacant lot during lunch to answer workers' questions about the 
consolidation. But the meetings stopped two weeks ago because, company 
officials say, they had no new information. But workers and union stewards say 
they quit attending well before the sessions were canceled because they got no 
answers to their questions. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are trying to take care of basic things, get bills paid off, looking 
into other careers," said one union representative, who noted that the company 
has continued its long pattern of trickling layoffs monthly at Fullerton. Last 
month, union reps said, 20 hourly workers at Hughes were laid off, and 19 more 
are expected to be dismissed this month.

 Another longtime worker who is a thinking of starting his own business said:

JAMES FLANIGAN: MEXICO POISED FOR ECONOMIC VOTE OF CONFIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexico is about to offer the world a live demonstration of how important faith 
and confidence are to an economy. 
</P>
<P>
 If its national elections next Sunday are carried out "cleanly" -- without 
tampering or egregious vote fraud -- then no matter which presidential 
candidate comes out ahead, confidence in Mexico will surge. 
</P>
<P>
 Internationally and domestically, that will uncap tremendous flows of pent-up 
business investment and the country, without fear of inflation, will be able to 
push its economy for much-needed growth -- 4% or even 5%, sufficient to create 
1 million jobs a year. 
</P>
<P>
 A good election will confirm the wisdom of the economic program that has 
guided Mexico for the last six years and from which Americans could learn a 
thing or two. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest news is encouraging. With a week to go, confidence is rising that 
the election will be open and above board and launch Mexico on a new political 
path more suited to its economic maturity. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the election result is clouded by substantial charges of tampering by 
the long-ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI), it will unleash 
demonstrations throughout the country. Financial markets will sell off, and 
investors will put their money elsewhere, deducing that Mexico isn't going to 
change after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Why such tangible, pesos-and-centavos consequences from intangible faith and 
confidence? 
</P>
<P>
 Because of all the body blows to confidence that characterized Mexico's 
economy in the 1970s and '80s: massive devaluations, loan defaults, 
nationalizations of industry. Foreign investors were burned badly, and most are 
on the fence today. 
</P>
<P>
 But that foreign discomfort was as nothing compared to the sufferings inside 
Mexico. In 1987, the year before the government of President Carlos Salinas de 
Gortari and his band of U.S.-educated "technocrats" took office, inflation in 
Mexico was 159% and the government deficit was 16% of gross domestic product. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this year, inflation is down to 7% and there is no government deficit, 
zero, none. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans, who wring their hands over chronic government deficits, should take 
a look at how Mexico solved its problems. It sold state industries and used the 
proceeds to pay down debt. And it lowered taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that Mexico's national debt today is equal to 11% of its total 
annual output, or GDP, compared to roughly 60% in the U.S. and more than that 
in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, lower taxes on a broader tax base have increased government revenues, 
while encouraging investment and saving. 
</P>
<P>
 "We lowered the corporate tax rate from 42% to 34% and repealed the tax on 
dividends," explains Francisco Gil Diaz, deputy governor of the Bank of Mexico 
-- the nation's central bank -- and the man responsible for the tax reform. 
</P>
<P>
 "For individuals the top rate was 55%. We lowered it to 35%, and we have no 
state and local income taxes. And we introduced a treatment for capital gains 
that practically means they are not taxed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also if you own a share in a corporation and you are in a lower bracket than 
the corporate 34% rate, you can claim a credit for the difference between tax 
the corporation paid and the tax you owe," says Gil, whose doctorate in 
economics is from the University of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of such tax relief is that it encourages saving and capital 
formation in a country that is starved for capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, but one reason for political unrest is that Mexico is a country of large 
income disparities, with a government that lacks credibility due to a 
well-earned reputation for doing favors for its friends. Was tax reform another 
bauble for Mexico's billionaire families? 
</P>
<P>
 No, because along with lower rates went tougher collections, so that income 
tax revenues have risen from $5.9 billion in 1988 to $20 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 And savings among the Mexican people, even though poor, may be the surprise 
story of the next few years. There is pent-up demand for mortgages, which are 
coming back after disappearing in the inflationary chaos of 10 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 There is great demand for housing, in short supply at all levels. Condominium 
properties in Mexico City sell for $300 to $500 a square foot, prices 
comparable to Beverly Hills and Manhattan's East Side. 
</P>
<P>
 Change is already here in Mexico. For if tax relief was the government's 
carrot for industry, the stick is competition. Trucking has been deregulated 
and shipping charges are way down. State-owned airlines have been sold and are 
now lower-priced and competitive. The privatized Telefonos de Mexico will face 
long-distance competition in a few years. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mexico is spurring bank competition by allowing new banks to form and by 
inviting in more than 100 foreign banks and investment firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's economy remains volatile, to be sure. To finance a trade and current 
account deficit, the government is borrowing short term and in dollars. As 
Mexican industry restructures for NAFTA and global competition, earnings 
prospects and stock prices of Mexican companies could tumble. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the election goes well, the boost to Mexican business will be powerful 
and immediate. Specifically, Mexico will soon gain an investment grade credit 
rating from Moody's and Standard & Poor's, a measure of faith and confidence 
that will allow its companies to borrow at lower interest rates on world 
markets. 
</P>
<P>
 What price faith and confidence? Mexico's companies, even big ones, are now 
forced to borrow at 10% to 12% interest while global competitors pay only 7% 
for credit. 
</P>
<P>
 After Aug. 21, Mexico should get to demonstrate what a renewal of confidence 
is worth.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS: CLINTON'S DEFENSE CUTS: RISKY FOR THE NATION, BAD FOR 
CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL J. BOSKIN, MICHAEL J. BOSKIN, former chairman of the President's 
Council of Economic Advisers, is Tully M. Friedman professor of economics and 
senior fellow, Hoover Institution, at Stanford University. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three seemingly unrelated news stories in the past two weeks, partially buried 
under the Simpson case and the Whitewater scandal, actually combine to offer a 
glimpse into California's economic growth prospects for the next couple of 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the state economic news continued to be consistent with slow recovery 
-- jobs and construction going up, but not fast enough to prevent a rise in the 
unemployment rate. (Cautionary note: Federal unemployment statistics for 
individual states are notoriously unreliable.) Second, the General Accounting 
Office -- Congress' sometimes controversial watchdog -- reported that President 
Clinton's defense budget is $150 billion too small over the next five years to 
cover his own limited priorities. Third, while American troops are on a 
humanitarian mission to Rwanda to help alleviate the almost unimaginable 
refugee disaster, the Clinton Administration seems poised to invade Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 These apparently disparate stories together foreshadow major national security 
problems and continued economic problems for California unless Congress and the 
President rethink the Administration's reckless defense drawdown. Clinton is 
driving the defense share of the economy to its lowest level since the Great 
Depression. Our entire history reveals that every time we overdo a defense 
drawdown, the next necessary buildup is always vastly more costly in terms of 
resources and American lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, President Clinton's ill-conceived defense drawdown -- 
incidentally also the major problem of California's economy -- is finally 
coming under scrutiny in Congress and elsewhere as ruthless aggressors from 
Bosnia to North Korea thumb their noses at America's interests. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's strategy is to be able to engage in two regional conflicts 
simultaneously. While this might seem far-fetched, imagine that during the Gulf 
War, North Korea had invaded South Korea. Possibilities abound that American 
military forces, on missions ranging from humanitarian aid to combat, will be 
required to defend our own national interests. Defense Secretary William J. 
Perry, asked why the United States was launching the aid mission to Rwanda, 
said it was "because we're the only ones with the logistical capability" to do 
so. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-conflicts strategy is necessary because if America is unable to deal 
with two conflicts simultaneously, aggressors need only to wait for the United 
States to become preoccupied somewhere and unable to respond elsewhere. Worse 
yet, it would make us much more reluctant to defend our interests knowing that 
we would forgo the opportunity to respond if another conflict arose. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, even if one agrees with Clinton's defense priorities, he will have to 
come up with an additional $150 billion to provide the defense resources to 
carry out those policies (funds available if he abandons his new social 
engineering domestic programs, which are unlikely to solve the problems they 
putatively address). 
</P>
<P>
 Most serious national security analysts believe the Clinton priorities are a 
minimalist notion of what U.S. military preparedness and capability should be 
in the dangerous and volatile post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 The $150 billion is not just a lot of money. It is necessary to make sure we 
have sufficient aircraft carrier groups, Air Force wings, Army divisions and 
the training, sophisticated weaponry, spare parts and lift capability to 
project our strength when and where it is necessary. If not, we not only may 
find ourselves in trouble launching a future action, but may be more likely to 
need to do so as the deterrent effect of a strong America willing and able to 
use force disappears. 
</P>
<P>
 The only way American foreign policy can be successful is for it to be backed 
by strength, including the ability and will to use military resources 
appropriately. Ronald Reagan, George Shultz and Cap Weinberger knew that, and 
the military buildup and staring down of the Soviets helped to destroy 
communism. George Bush, Jim Baker and Dick Cheney knew that, and successfully 
navigated the end of the Cold War and masterfully drove Saddam Hussein out of 
Kuwait. So far, unfortunately, it appears that President Clinton hasn't the 
slightest clue. For America and the world, let's hope he catches on quickly and 
works out a more sensible defense drawdown with Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do I make such a fuss about these issues in a column usually devoted to 
California's economy? As reiterated over and over again here, the Clinton 
drawdown is not only imprudent for the nation's security, it represents the big 
economic earthquake for California, accounting for over half the jobs lost 
during the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 To repeat: One out of five dollars the United States spends on defense is 
spent in California -- on personnel, bases, aerospace procurement, etc. A 
defense drawdown that would be $150 billion smaller over five years translates 
roughly into $30 billion less income to be sucked out of the state, about the 
same as our pro rata share of a $250-billion federal tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparing the more prudent drawdown with Clinton's current plan makes a big 
difference to California: The additional cuts Clinton proposes,beyond the 
already large defense drawdown agreed to at the end of the Bush presidency, 
would cost the California economy $16 billion or more a year, assuming the 
reductions are spread proportionately across the country. The more prudent 
drawdown would bring the extra hit to California down to about $10 billion a 
year, rather than $16 billion or more annually. The difference amounts to 
perhaps a quarter of a million jobs for Californians. 
</P>
<P>
 Our primary interests must be in the nation's security and in America's 
geopolitical role in the world, but recent events -- and independent, detailed 
analyses -- keep revealing that the Clinton defense drawdown, so damaging to 
California's economy, doesn't measure up to his own defense priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to demand this for our nation's security, and the side benefit will be 
a reduction of the drag on California's economy.

COMMUTER CARRIERS PICK UP THE SPOILS AS MAJOR AIRLINES RETRENCH; 
TRANSPORTATION: THEIR BUSINESS IS LITERALLY SOARING AS THEY FIND A NICHE IN THE 
ABANDONED SHORTER ROUTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His black valise in tow and a blank stare on his face, Christopher Atayan 
waits to board a small American Eagle turboprop that he dubs "the flying sewer 
pipe." 
</P>
<P>
 Atayan logs 100,000 air miles a year as a New York investment banker. Too many 
of them, he said, are aboard cramped little puddle jumpers like the one he 
waits to board. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are small, they feel unsafe, are noisy and slow," he groused while 
slumping against a check-in counter inside the air-conditioned confines of 
Orange County's John Wayne Airport. Still, "you have to fly them." 
</P>
<P>
 True to his word, Atayan troops out on the sun-baked Tarmac to climb aboard 
the 19-passenger British Aerospace turboprop for the hop to Los Angeles 
International Airport, where he will thankfully transfer to a wide-body jet for 
the ride home to the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Few products or services can match the animosity that some travelers hold 
toward commuter airlines. Not only are the industry's smaller, propeller-driven 
planes derided as airborne lawn mowers, passengers have to pay handsomely for 
the privilege of being jostled through what many consider not-so-friendly 
skies. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet commuter carriers have become the quiet victors of the recent airline 
wars. Complain as they may, about 53 million passengers flew aboard commuter 
aircraft last year -- a 25% increase in two years -- according to an industry 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter affiliates have stepped in to take over service on less-popular runs 
that are being abandoned by the major airlines. The majors are desperate to cut 
costs to make up for the more than $8 billion lost in ruinous fare wars in the 
past few years. 
</P>
<P>
 Little airlines have discovered they can turn a tidy profit flying their small 
planes on routes that the bigger carriers left behind. For instance, SkyWest 
picked up Delta Air Lines flights that had been dropped from Salt Lake City to 
Casper, Wyo.; Rapid City and Sioux Falls, S.D., and Butte, Mont. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a good deal, too, for the retreating carriers. By relinquishing 
unprofitable routes to their commuter affiliates, they continue to be fed 
passengers into their profitable, long-haul routes in a bid to retain customer 
loyalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since 1988, the major carriers have turned over 65% of their routes of 500 
miles or less to their regional partners. That's where the growth has been," 
said Walt Coleman, president of the Regional Airlines Assn., a Washington-based 
industry group. 
</P>
<P>
 Financially, the commuter carriers have many of the traits that major airlines 
hope to emulate as they restructure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every factor of our cost structure is lower," said Marty Hires, spokesman for 
American Eagle, a group of four commuter airlines affiliated with American 
Airlines that covers most of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Regional airlines are flexible, able to add or delete routes within days based 
on market conditions. Their upper management isn't slowed by large 
bureaucracies that have characterized some big carriers, so service problems 
can often be fixed with a single phone call. 
</P>
<P>
 Commuter carriers usually have loyal work forces that are paid less than those 
of major airlines, and they are not subject to rigorous union work rules that 
old-line carriers say make them less competitive with cost-cutting upstarts. 
Their smaller size results in a greater sense of teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 "With SkyWest, you're never far away from home. It's a family," said Jamie 
Berry, a Palm Springs-based flight attendant. 
</P>
<P>
 At the commuters, everybody pitches in, from pilots to managers, when it comes 
to getting planes in and out as quickly as possible -- usually within 10 
minutes of touchdown. "I love to work the ramp," said Jeff Keller, Orange 
County station chief for Delta affiliate SkyWest Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Co-pilot Bryan Salvati personally helps passengers negotiate the steps off the 
plane, loads bags and still flies a schedule that would leave many of his peers 
looking like slackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven stops, and that's an easy day," said the ex-Trans World Airlines 
employee as he eyed a wrinkled flight schedule he pulled from his coat pocket. 
"I love it. . . . The flying is better for me, and I like working with a 
smaller group." 
</P>
<P>
 A commuter pilot with six years of experience can expect to make $32,000 to 
$40,000 a year, while their counterparts at a major airline earn $72,000 to 
$90,000, according to FAPA, an Atlanta-based career and financial planning 
service for airline employees. Experienced flight attendants average about 
$16,800 on the commuters -- a third less than the average $25,200 wage for 
attendants on major carriers. Mechanics earn about $13 an hour, compared to 
$19.50 at a major carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Some major airlines own their own commuter carriers outright and operate them 
as separate entities. American Airlines' parent, AMR Corp. of Ft. Worth, for 
instance, owns all of the companies around the country that fly under the 
American Eagle commuter carrier. 
</P>
<P>
 Lower costs allow the commuter carriers to make money even if they are less 
than full. Even with planes of 70 seats or fewer, commuter carriers generally 
have break-even operations if they fill half the plane -- compared to the 60% 
capacity needed for the major airlines, according to the Regional Airline Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the reason is the airplanes themselves. A 50- to 70-seat turboprop 
costs less than half as much to operate as a jet with twice as many seats, said 
Ken Roberts, manager of business operations for Allison Engine Co. in 
Indianapolis, which makes both jets and turboprops. Propeller planes have lower 
fuel costs because they are smaller, and they are generally easier to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for healthy profit margins is the generally higher fares 
commuter airlines can charge on many routes to otherwise isolated destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the short legs, sometimes they will make you pay dearly, because most 
times there isn't competition," said David Stempler, executive director of the 
International Airline Passengers Assn. in Washington, a lobbying group. 
</P>
<P>
 A ticket on a flight between Orange County and Los Angeles -- a 35-mile jaunt 
for which five commuter carriers compete -- generally costs about $55 one way, 
although a connection onto a major carrier can severely cut the cost. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry representatives defend the fares as representative of the costs of 
flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ever since Southwest (Airlines) entered the world, we think every fare should 
be $69," said Ron Reber, a SkyWest Airlines senior vice president in St. 
George, Utah. He added that his airlines' fares average about $100 one way and 
the average trip about 400 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 To lure more of the traveling executives that make up their core customer 
base, commuter airlines have been looking for answers short of their own 
miniature version of a fare war. They have taken several steps to make their 
planes more comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 Small jets are now being used on some routes, cutting travel time over longer 
distances. SkyWest has bought four 50-seat commuter jetliners that are being 
used on runs such as Salt Lake City to Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 And some of the newer, bigger turboprop planes have cabins with high enough 
ceilings that passengers don't have to stoop when they board. Flight attendants 
serve drinks and snacks.  
</P>
<P>
 And the commuter airline fleet is generally young -- 6 years old or less -- 
with the latest in cockpit avionics. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look at propellers and think 'old-time airplanes,' " association 
official Coleman said, "but they are not." 
</P>
<P>
 People say they are willing to fly them for a simple reason: convenience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only about 10 minutes' air time, but it's worth it," said Al Butler, a 
technical engineer who drives from his Long Beach home to Orange County to fly 
a commuter to Los Angeles International rather than simply drive the 35 miles 
to the international airport. Parking costs half as much in Orange County, he 
explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Safety is an issue in many people's minds, given how commuter airplanes are 
generally dwarfed on runways by the big jets. Those fears were not helped by a 
National Transportation Safety Board examination of the industry that was 
launched in March and prompted by a crash in Minnesota that killed all 18 
aboard a commuter flight. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a consistently higher accident rate than the major airlines," said 
Ted Lopatkiewicz, a spokesman for the NTSB in Washington. The agency is 
discussing whether to require that planes with 30 seats or fewer be required to 
meet the same rigorous safety standards of larger aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Given customer preference for jets, commuter carriers are quick to withdraw 
service if they are challenged by low-cost jet service from a major airline on 
one of their routes. Witness the quick exit of United Express from its Orange 
County-to-Oakland routes when Southwest Airlines entered the market in May with 
advance purchase fares as low as $49 each way, about half of what United 
Express was charging for a trip that took twice as long. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't compete with Southwest. Only a fool would do that against a jet with 
$49 fares," said Rolly Bergeson, president of Westair in Fresno, which flies in 
the West as United Express. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, however, have gotten lucky. When Southwest unit Morris Air started 
Boeing 737 service on SkyWest's Fresno-to-Las Vegas run, the commuter airline 
decided to stay put. It was hoping, successfully it turned out, that Morris 
would pull out when it couldn't sell enough tickets to justify jet service. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to define our markets. Our markets are not the same," Reber said. 
"You can't out-Southwest Southwest." 
</P>
<P>
 Steering clear of major competitors and charting their markets around the 
Bakersfields and Modestos of the world has paid off for the commuter industry. 
Most of the major players are profitable, usually more so than the major 
airlines with which they have forged alliances. 
</P>
<P>
 SkyWest, for instance, announced a record profit of $14.4 million in its most 
recent fiscal year, more than double the previous year's. By contrast, its 
giant affiliate, Delta Air Lines, had a profit of only $10.8 million in its 
most recent fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, even the newest of jet carriers is anxious to dip into the 
commuter market. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent convert is Nevada-based Reno Air, which announced July 14 that 
it signed a deal to start Reno Air Express, flying propeller-driven Jetstreams 
from its San Jose hub to Northern California cities such as Chico and Eureka. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air, only 2 years old and with no more than 17 jetliners itself, felt it 
needed a commuter affiliate to expand its presence at its hub in San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it will increase our niche in the West, and this is an excellent way 
to do that," said spokeswoman Sue Putnam. And why not? The arrangement with New 
York-based partner Phoenix Leasing won't cost Reno Air anything except some 
accounting and ticket processing charges. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't make any predictions" about success, she added, "but we think there 
is an excellent market there." 
</P>
<P>
 Reno Air will have a ready customer base in people like Donald and Hazel 
Wright, a pair of retirees from Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple were taking a commuter plane on the trip home from seeing their 
grandchildren. They flew by commuter to Los Angeles, by major airline to 
Washington, and then took a second commuter hop to Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Any concerns about the noise of the plane? "It's fine as far as I'm 
concerned," Donald Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 And it beats driving. "It's easier for our son. He lives 10 minutes from 
here." The Top 5

MUTUAL FUNDS / RUSS WILES: MEXICO LIKELY TO STAY HIGH ON INVESTORS' LISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS WILES, RUSS WILES, a financial writer for the Arizona Republic, 
specializes in mutual funds. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexicans go to the polls later this month to decide the fate of the incumbent 
Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI). But regardless of the outcome, the 
country will probably remain a darling among U.S. mutual funds that invest in 
emerging foreign stock markets.  
</P>
<P>
 Mexico watchers say that's because the free-market reforms that have helped 
transform Mexico from an economic basket case aren't likely to be reversed even 
in the unlikely event that the PRI loses the presidency for the first time in 
six decades. Although short-term uncertainty would result from an upset and the 
pace of reform might lag, the direction won't change.  
</P>
<P>
 "Regardless of the outcome, the direction of Mexico's economic future is 
guaranteed," Jonathan E. Heath, chief economist at Mexico City think tank MACRO 
Asesoria Economica, wrote in a recent report. 
</P>
<P>
 "Political debate on economic issues has focused on possible alternative paths 
within Mexico's new development model, with very few arguing for an all-around 
reversal," he added.  
</P>
<P>
 If anything, investors now seem more confident that the PRI and its 
presidential candidate, Ernesto Zedillo, will fare well later this month, as 
indicated by rising stock prices in Mexico City. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very bullish," says Erin Spatz, Latin American analyst for Pioneer 
Mutual Funds in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 Some even feel that Mexican stocks have become a bit pricey now that they are 
near historic highs. The market, which rose by a third in late 1993, sustained 
sharp losses early this year when an armed rebellion broke out in the southern 
state of Chiapas and Luis Donaldo Colosio, Zedillo's predecessor as the PRI 
presidential candidate, was assassinated in Tijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Spatz and others believe the PRI is making a concerted effort to ensure that 
the Aug. 21 vote will be a valid, fraud-free election, thereby removing another 
source of worry.  
</P>
<P>
 That should allow investors to focus again on Mexico's general economic 
picture, which has been one of sustained progress under President Carlos 
Salinas de Gortari:  
</P>
<P>
 * Mexico's inflation rate has dropped to about 7% from more than 150% in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 * The government has run a budget surplus the last two years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Foreign investment has doubled since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * Exports are growing and are much less dependent on petroleum. 
</P>
<P>
 * The government has eliminated price controls, privatized much industry, 
reduced tariffs and cut tax rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's economy grew by only 0.4% in 1993, the slowest pace in five years, 
but much of that can be explained by uncertainty about whether the United 
States would ratify the North American Free Trade Agreement. Approval came in 
November, and now that business leaders on both sides of the border can proceed 
with their plans, Mexico should see higher growth this year, many believe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The U.S. economy is picking up, and Mexico is a prime candidate to piggyback 
on that," says Caroline Lane, London-based portfolio manager of the Govett 
Latin America Fund, which is headquartered in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane recently raised her fund's Mexican exposure to 49% of total assets from 
39% in mid-July. 
</P>
<P>
 James Capel & Co., a London investment firm, predicts 4% real annual growth 
for Mexico over the rest of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Mexico's long-term growth prospects appear solid, there is 
disagreement as to whether this is already reflected in Mexican share prices. 
Lane believes the bad-news selling of spring has abated, and Spatz is heartened 
by an expected 22% to 25% improvement in Mexican corporate profits next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But Josephine Jimenez, portfolio manager of the San Francisco-based Montgomery 
Emerging Markets Fund, believes that the peso remains overvalued against the 
dollar and that Mexican stock prices are fairly high. This explains why she 
reduced her fund's Mexican exposure to 6% currently, down from 10% in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, global money manager Charles Brandes of San Diego says he isn't 
finding many values in the Mexican market, with the exception of Telefonos de 
Mexico, the country's dominant stock. If you remove this issue, which is 
trading at a price-earnings ratio of about 9, and banking shares, which are 
also selling at low multiples, "Mexican stocks are not that cheap," Brandes 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 Also troubling to Jimenez is Chiapas. When she visited the region in May, she 
found an unsettled situation in an economically important state that accounts 
for a large portion of Mexico's electricity, natural gas, coffee and corn 
output.  
</P>
<P>
 "The conflict in Chiapas has not been resolved," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jimenez has turned more positive on Mexico in recent weeks as 
interest rates have dropped and the political risks seem to have abated, 
Chiapas remains a "wild card" that could set an example of unrest for other 
Latin American countries with large Indian populations, she says.  
</P>
<P>
 But Spatz doesn't think the Chiapas turmoil will derail Mexico's movement 
along a free-market path. To the contrary, she says, the people in this region 
rebelled because they have seen good in the reforms and want to be included. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, Mexico almost certainly will remain a favorite destination among the 
more aggressive international mutual funds.  
</P>
<P>
 Latin America and East Asia are the two most dynamic investment regions, and 
Mexico has the largest stock market south of the Rio Grande. Mexico also has a 
unique tie to the world's largest economy, the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long-term investors can expect to see a good amount of growth in Mexico 
beyond 1995," Spatz says. 
</P>
<P>
 But they will have to live with uncertainty and volatility along the way. 
</P>

 Contributions to individual retirement accounts fell again last year, to an 
estimated $10.5 billion, says the IRA Reporter newsletter in Brainerd, Minn. 
That was down from $10.6 billion in 1992 and marked the fourth consecutive 
yearly decline. Volume peaked in 1986 at $38.3 billion, but tax reform that 
year curtailed the deductibility of IRA contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 33% of all IRA assets are in mutual funds, with slightly more than half 
of that in stock portfolios. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Evergreen Value Timing Fund, which doesn't try to time the market, has 
switched its name to Evergreen Growth & Income. The fund is headquartered in 
Purchase, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Also changing names were the three portfolios in the Quantitative Group of 
Funds of Lincoln, Mass. The Quantitative Numeric Fund is the new nomenclature 
for the Boston Numeric Series, Quantitative Growth & Income substitutes for 
Boston Growth & Income, and Quantitative International Equity replaces Boston 
Foreign Growth & Income.

 Men hold about 10 times more seats on the boards of mutual fund companies than 
women, says a Boston-based trade newsletter. In a study of the boards at 56 
leading fund groups, Mutual Fund Market News found that men hold 5,983 director 
positions, compared to 517 for women. 
</P>
<P>
 "While these boards may represent funds' management, it is highly unlikely 
that they reflect their shareholders," says the newsletter. Women make up about 
44% of fund investors. Ways to Play Mexico 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who wants to invest in a volatile stock market such as Mexico's should 
consider a diversified approach. Depending on the type of fund, Mexican stocks 
could be a large or small part of a general strategy. Here are the levels of 
Mexican exposure offered by funds in selected categories. 
</P>
<P>
 * Global and International. Lipper Analytical Services of Summit, N.J., 
identifies more than 100 global and 200 international names. Global funds 
include the United States; international funds invest everywhere else. These 
funds generally focus their foreign holdings in the larger markets of Western 
Europe and Japan, with 6% to 8% of their money in Latin America, of which 
Mexico is usually the largest part. 
</P>
<P>
 * Emerging markets. A couple of dozen portfolios key on the developing foreign 
economies outside Western Europe and Japan. About 40% of their money is in 
Latin America, with Mexico accounting for nearly half that. 
</P>
<P>
 * Regional. At midyear, Lipper counted nine distinct Latin American funds, the 
biggest run by Fidelity Investments, G.T. Capital, Merrill Lynch and Scudder. 
As the largest Latin market, Mexico figures in as much as 50% of the regional 
funds' assets. 
</P>
<P>
 * Single country. A few closed-end portfolios concentrate on Mexican stocks. 
They are the Mexico Fund, the Mexico Equity & Income Fund and the Emerging 
Mexico Fund.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: HOW DO YOU KNOW IF IT'S THE RIGHT TIME TO 
SELL? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is it time to sell the dogs in your portfolio? 
</P>
<P>
 A recent wave of corporate mergers, interest rate hikes, continuing 
downsizings and restructurings by major companies, opinions of an overvalued 
stock market -- among other things -- are making this question pivotal for many 
investors, some experts maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Selling at the right time can drastically improve your investment results. But 
no one likes to talk about selling, experts say. Instead, investors who buy a 
stock or mutual fund that loses ground -- or changes so drastically that it no 
longer suits their investment goals -- tend to hang on, hoping against hope 
that the investment will come back, says Michael Wilkinson, president of ADAM 
Investment Services in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wants to admit that they made a mistake," says Wilkinson. "If they 
only talk about the winners and about where next to invest, they never have to 
say, 'Golly, look at the dumb thing I did here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 How do you determine the right time to sell? There's no simple answer, but 
here are a few factors that experts say you should assess: 
</P>
<P>
 * Market conditions. If you invest in individual stocks or in "sector" funds 
-- those that concentrate on specialized industries -- consider how overall 
market trends will affect your portfolio. Will interest rate hikes decimate the 
earnings of your bank and utility stocks? Will the success or failure of health 
care reform benefit or harm the value of your biotechnology, health care or 
tobacco stocks? If all of your investments are in industries unlikely to be 
scathed by pending change, move on to the next consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 * Price-earnings ratios. Measurements of how a company's selling price 
compares to its earnings are a good measure of whether the stock is 
undervalued, overvalued or about right. 
</P>
<P>
 However, there is no "right" range that applies to every company, says Stephen 
W. Boesel, president of Baltimore-based T. Rowe Price's growth and income fund. 
The way to evaluate a price-earnings ratio is by reviewing company history, he 
says.  
</P>
<P>
 Value Line investment reports -- available at many public libraries -- show 
the past levels of individual company price-earnings ratios. If your company's 
ratio is currently at the high end of that historic range, consider whether the 
company's size and earnings are set to grow faster than normal. If not, it may 
be time to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dividend yields. Comparing a stock's dividend to its market price is also a 
telling indication of value. If today's dividend yield is historically low, it 
may be because the company's market price is too high and set for a fall -- 
another bailout signal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Corporate change. Mergers, restructurings and sales of subsidiaries can 
cause companies to change direction. If your companies have drastically altered 
their business lines, consider whether you're still comfortable investing with 
them for the long haul. 
</P>
<P>
 * Results. If the stock you buy loses 10% of its value right off the bat, you 
should sell it, says Ernie Mysogland, executive vice president and chief 
investment officer of NWNL Northstar Funds in Greenwich, Conn. That loss is an 
indication that you either overpaid for the stock or were mistaken about its 
fundamentals, he says. Don't be thrown for a loop if share prices fall back a 
bit once they've appreciated, though. The rule of thumb is to sell losers and 
let the winners ride -- at least until they hit their target prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * Price targets. Normally, you should buy stocks when you think they're 
undervalued and sell when you think they're fully valued, says Mysogland. That 
means you must take a close look at a company's fundamentals -- such as price 
relative to earnings, dividend yields and growth prospects -- and have a clear 
idea of how high the stock should go to account for the company's underlying 
value, the "target price." For instance, you may think a stock that's selling 
for $20 is worth $30. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember the target price. And once you hit it, sell, Mysogland says. It may 
be that the stock rises higher. But unless the company's prospects changed 
between your initial evaluation and when it hit the target price, you're better 
off getting out while the getting's good. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fund performance. When you invest through mutual funds, you rely on a fund 
manager to analyze the fundamentals of each stock. You analyze managers by 
paying close attention to their performance relative to that of other similar 
funds. In other words, compare growth funds to growth funds, global to global 
and so on. 
</P>
<P>
 As a rule of thumb, buy based on close analysis of five years' worth of strong 
performance but sell based on shorter-term results -- just four quarters, says 
Wilkinson. Don't sell a fund just because it's not in the Top 10. But if it's 
not ranked among the top 50% of funds in its category for four quarters in a 
row, it's time to look for a better option, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say you should watch a little longer -- between five and six quarters. 
And you should be more apt to switch if there have been significant changes in 
the direction or management of the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 "If one-year performance is lagging and it's in conjunction with a policy 
change, investment strategy change or manager change, then that fund ought to 
be on watch," says Craig Litman, principal in Litman/Gregory & Co., a San 
Francisco-based investment management firm. "If there has been no major change 
in direction, you should give it a little more time." 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, more than 18 months of lagging performance is a sell signal, 
these experts maintain.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: DEFAULT LIABILITY DEPENDS ON LOAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. A friend lost his job and is in foreclosure on his house. Can the lender 
come after him for the balance of the loan? I heard that state law protects 
home buyers. Is that true? N.H.  
</P>
<P>
 A. Whether your friend can be pursued for the balance of the loan depends 
entirely on what type of loan he has. In California, a "money purchase" loan -- 
that is, a loan secured to purchase a house -- is a non-recourse loan. That 
means the bank has no recourse against the borrower's other assets. The lender 
can only go after the asset (the home) that secures the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if your friend refinanced his loan, he no longer has a money purchase 
loan and could be subject to proceedings that would allow the bank to attach 
his other assets to pay off the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the bank actually do that? 
</P>
<P>
 Practically speaking, lenders are no more anxious than you are to be saddled 
with a huge portfolio of depressed real estate in a soft market. Not only do 
they face loan losses, but it costs them money to maintain and resell the 
properties they take back from their borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 In an increasing number of cases, lenders are willing to work out a solution 
with a potentially defaulting borrower. In these cases, the lender will accept 
a "deed in lieu of foreclosure" that essentially gives back the property to the 
lender without going through a formal foreclosure procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the lender will even agree not to notify credit-reporting 
bureaus of the transaction, sparing the borrower a blow to his or her future 
credit-worthiness. 
</P>
<P>
 Before your friend walks away from his house, he should try to secure a deed 
in lieu of foreclosure. Your friend could strike a deal to help the lender sell 
the home. Your friend would agree to maintain the home and show it to potential 
buyers in exchange for permission to continue living there. Separate 
Withdrawals From Pension Accounts 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I am getting conflicting opinions on mandatory withdrawals from 403(b) 
annuities and IRAs. At age 70 1/2, must you take the required withdrawal from 
each account separately, or can you make a single withdrawal from either one? 
-- M.G.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A. You must take your disbursements separately from each type of pension 
account, making one withdrawal from the annuity as well as one from your IRA. 
If you have more than one IRA, you may select the account from which to make 
your total mandatory IRA withdrawal. However, annuity withdrawals must each be 
made separately if you have more than one of those types of pension plans. 
Under no circumstances can you mathematically combine your various plan account 
balances and make a single withdrawal. Stock Value After Firm Sold Depends on 
Deal 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I bought 250 shares of a software company five years ago. It was my very 
first time in the stock market. Now I have gotten a letter from the company 
saying that they are being acquired by another company and that all outstanding 
shares will be purchased by that company. What happens if I choose not to sell? 
Will my shares lose their value? -- E.Y . 
</P>
<P>
 A. If you choose not to tender your shares at the time of acquisition, what 
happens to your stock depends on the terms of the deal between the two 
companies. Remember, these companies are theoretically run as a democracy; any 
deal must be approved by the majority of the shareholders, and the majority 
does rule. (However, it is fair to observe here that directors and senior 
management often compose the controlling majority of shareholders, so any deal 
struck by management is, in effect, approved by the shareholders as well.) 
</P>
<P>
 What choices are open to a dissenting shareholder? In some cases, the deal 
could permit shareholders to exchange their stock for a commensurate amount of 
shares in the acquiring company, an offer that spares an immediate tax 
obligation in the event the shareholder's stock has greatly appreciated. 
However, this option is not always available.  
</P>
<P>
 Another possibility is that the acquiring company will allow uncooperative 
shareholders to remain in a kind of corporate limbo with their old stock. This 
last scenario is hardly desirable; you would have no effective market for your 
shares, and any dividends the shares once generated would end; eventually you 
would have to give in and redeem the old stock. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line is that you will eventually have to accept whatever deal the 
shareholder majority approves if you want to realize your investment in the 
stock. Tax Liability on Note Carried on Rental Sale 
</P>
<P>
 Q. A few years ago, we sold a rental property through a 1031 exchange. We also 
carried a note on the property. Now the buyer wants to pay off the note 
balance. What is our tax liability? -- E.S.V . 
</P>
<P>
 A. A lot depends on the terms of the sale. If the money you lent the purchaser 
had been fully taxed at the time of the sale -- this assumes the loan was not 
made with proceeds from the exchange transaction itself -- then you would have 
no tax obligation because the payoff is merely a return on your after-tax 
principal. (Of course, you are already paying taxes on any interest the note 
carries over the loan term.)  
</P>
<P>
 If, however, your deal was a partial installment sale and a partial exchange 
-- and if it was, you should know it -- you would be liable for taxes on that 
part of the payoff that represents untaxed, deferred gain.

RTC WANTS RECEIVER FOR PLAZA ALICANTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WOODYARD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Resolution Trust Corp. has filed a lawsuit asking that a receiver be 
appointed to oversee the Plaza Alicante office tower and adjacent 400-room 
hotel because the property owner, Gateway Properties of Irvine, has fallen 
nearly $1.5 million behind in its payments. 
</P>
<P>
 The RTC filed the action this week in Orange County Superior Court as 
conservator of Western Federal Savings Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The Alicante complex, a swank high-rise development on Harbor Boulevard, is 
95% owned by Gateway Properties and 5% by the Garden Grove Agency for Community 
Development, according to the documents. 
</P>
<P>
 Gateway, whose partners include well-known credit dentist Robert Beauchamp, 
said it would have no comment on the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The property has been in financial trouble since at least 1991, when 
foreclosure proceedings were initiated by Western Federal, a Marina del Rey 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 The property subsequently was refinanced and Gateway signed a promissory note 
for $27.5 million in 1993, to be paid back through monthly statements, 
according the lawsuit. Gateway missed its June 4 payment of $1 million of 
principal. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit is not expected to affect daily operation of the hotel, which is 
operated under a management contract by Hyatt Corp. as the Hyatt Regency 
Alicante.

 Three out of every four times that Los Angeles police officers fire their 
weapons, superiors fault them for potentially life-threatening mistakes that 
warrant retraining or discipline, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Many officers succumbed to what one union leader called "the John Wayne 
Syndrome," according to a Times review of nearly 700 shooting reports since 
1989. They tended to be too aggressive, abandoning well-established safeguards 
when moving into armed confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 One officer fired at a possible burglar from nearly a football field away. 
Another shot an unarmed teen-ager who was displaying nothing resembling a 
weapon. Three others shot out their own windshields while trying to stop 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 A range of tactical errors, from poor communication to failure to take cover, 
may have led to dozens of other unnecessary shootings by officers in the Los 
Angeles Police Department, internal reports show. 
</P>
<P>
 One officer mistakenly shot another in the back as they converged in the 
darkness on an unarmed suspect. Commanders later blamed the incident on an 
"oversight": The officers had not turned on their flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
 And in nearly 100 cases, on- and off-duty officers accidentally fired their 
weapons, sometimes resulting in injuries or deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 An off-duty officer, leaving for the Persian Gulf War, wanted to give a friend 
a bullet from his .38-caliber revolver as a goodby memento. The gun misfired, 
and the officer shot her through the thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD officials have ruled that most non-accidental shootings were justified 
because the officers believed that lives were in danger when they pulled the 
trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they acknowledge some training weaknesses, officials maintain that 
the high rate of errors is chiefly a reflection of the department's overarching 
efforts to critique its own officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think we shined every shooting on like we weren't paying attention," 
said former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who signed off on hundreds of shooting 
reports before resigning under fire in 1992. "The fact is, we were 
hypercritical. . . . Every miscue is cited so we could learn from it." A 
Recurring Issue 
</P>
<P>
 Police shootings have proved a recurring issue in Los Angeles since 1979 when 
two police officers fatally shot Eulia Love, who was armed with a kitchen 
knife. This month, an LAPD officer shot and killed a man who was carrying a toy 
gun, prompting criticisms from some witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Rodney G. King beating in 1991, the Christopher Commission urged 
reforms involving the LAPD's use-of-force policies, including those for 
firearms. The department pledged a new use-of-force manual, but it is not yet 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times found in reviewing 694 internal LAPD reports that shooting-related 
mistakes are no less frequent today than five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 No action was deemed necessary in 25% of the cases. More than half of all 
shootings led to retraining, while a quarter resulted in punishment, including 
reprimand, suspension or dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although policies vary among law enforcement agencies, data from several 
suggests that officers in Los Angeles are cited for shooting-related mistakes 
far more frequently than elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach police officials ordered training or administrative review to 
correct mistakes in less than half of recent police shootings. Chicago took 
action in about one in five shootings, and the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department in less than one in 10. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the rate of mistakes found in Sheriff's Department shootings 
was also far lower than in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department spokesman Lt. Dan Martini said that out of 11 
non-accidental shootings by Orange County deputies since 1992, the department 
ordered discipline in only one case, taking no action in the rest. Unlike Los 
Angeles, the department does not consider training for officers involved in 
shootings, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County Sheriff's Department does not make public its internal 
reviews of officer-involved shootings. Last year, in one of the department's 
most controversial shootings, Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins was shot in the face 
and killed by fellow deputy Brian Scanlan during a Christmas Day training drill 
behind a Lake Forest movie theater. Scanlan had been using a loaded weapon 
during the drill in violation of department policy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department also releases less information about 
shootings than the LAPD. But the available records indicate that the Sheriff's 
Department, with almost as many officers as the LAPD, reports roughly half the 
number of shooting incidents each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigations of 25 sheriff's shootings resulted in discipline against three 
deputies in the second half of last year -- less than half the LAPD's rate for 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether the numbers reflect disparities in the frequency of 
firearms-related errors, or the vigor of departments in addressing them. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD does appear to take a tougher approach to post-shooting training than 
some other departments. Training at some agencies usually means a supervisor 
simply sits down with an officer to talk about the shooting, while other 
departments forgo training altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, officers in shootings are either disciplined or cleared; there is 
no retraining. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with such differences, one U.S. Justice Department official who 
specializes in tracking law enforcement data said the LAPD numbers still seem 
unusually high: "It says either there was a lack of training, or . . . a lack 
of supervision when it came to the use of (deadly) force." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who as vice chairman of the Public Safety 
Committee reviews police activities, said he too was surprised by the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this suggests to me is that force might not have been necessary in many 
of these shootings if individuals were better trained," Ridley-Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Chief Lawrence E. Fetters, who heads the in-house shooting review 
panel, blamed many shooting errors on training deficiencies caused by high 
turnover on the 7,500-officer force. He noted a decline in the experience level 
among training officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," he said, "it's kind of like the blind leading the blind." 
Needless Gunfire 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Tate had worked for years as an actor, with bit roles in movies and TV, 
even an award-winning off-Broadway performance. But by 1991, the parts had 
stopped coming in, and Tate was sweating his days away at two fast-food jobs 
and sleeping under tattered blankets on the floor of an abandoned South-Central 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the police came at 2 a.m. on March 23.  
</P>
<P>
 They had gotten a call -- groundless, it turned out -- that there was a body 
in the house, and two officers went inside. All the 59-year-old Tate knew was 
that there were two men with flashlights, raising a ruckus in the next room. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is it?" demanded a groggy Tate, still wearing his Pizza Hut uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police! Get your ass out here!" came the response, according to a deposition 
Tate gave two years ago. "Come out and take your hands out of your pockets!" 
</P>
<P>
 Tate did, but too quickly, and Officer Garland Hardeman fired, police said. 
The officers said they believed the belligerent suspect was reaching for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took my hands out of my pocket and the next thing I know I heard something 
like a hand clap, and I fell on the floor," Tate recalled. "There was a big 
gaping wound in my leg. . . . I said, 'I did what you wanted, and you shot me.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials later found the shooting unwarranted, records show, and they 
suspended Hardeman for five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate won a $150,000 settlement from the city. But he walked with a cane after 
two surgeries and a month in the hospital. Earlier this year, after he 
apparently had cashed a disability check, he was killed by muggers in 
Hollywood, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tate mishap is one of 58 shootings over the last five years in which the 
department issued its most serious finding: An officer was not justified in 
using deadly force because there was no immediate threat to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, an officer answering a gang call shot and killed a teacher's aide after 
mistaking a "dark object" for a gun; it turned out to be a camera. In other 
cases, a glove and a chrome-plated comb prompted police to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 In one 1990 confrontation with suspected car strippers, a police officer shot 
an unarmed teen-ager in the abdomen. The officer said the youth appeared to be 
reaching for a gun. But Chief Gates disciplined the officer after finding that 
he "did not see him holding anything that could even be construed as a weapon." 
The teen-ager was not charged, and the city agreed to a $1.4-million 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The common thread I've seen," said attorney Jeffrey Galen, who represented 
Tate and others in lawsuits against police, "is you see officers jumping the 
gun, shooting and asking questions later." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1989 and 1993, records show, the LAPD reported 127 fatalities in 
officer-involved shootings. Last year, the city agreed to pay $5.6 million to 
settle police shootings, more than half of all police litigation payouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwarranted shootings, representing about one in 10 of all non-accidental 
shootings, often occurred at the close of a car chase, in a suspected drug 
house, or at the end of a dark alley as officers answered a call. 
</P>
<P>
 But others came after hours, when officers were off duty. During an argument 
at her home, an officer fired into a Teddy bear. During a traffic dispute, 
another officer sprayed 13 rounds across a busy street, wounding three people 
in the other car. 
</P>
<P>
 A third off-duty officer went on what investigators described as "an 
aggressive, armed quest" after spotting a "beer run" robbery at a convenience 
store. Aided by his armed son, he ended up in a shootout with the bandits and 
was wounded in the head. The department disciplined him for shooting without 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In dozens of cases where officers did have reasons to shoot, the department 
found problems in the execution. Officers sometimes fired too many rounds or 
endangered bystanders by shooting at moving vehicles. One officer fired at a 
fleeing suspect from 283 feet away on a Downtown street. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a precept of policing that officers should use their guns only as a last 
resort -- when lives are in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 At the LAPD, where 22 on-duty officers have been killed in the last decade, 
even warning shots are discouraged in all but the most dire situations. Many 
officers pride themselves on never using their weapons during years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some departments, the LAPD investigates all "officer-involved 
shootings," whether the officer is on duty or off, whether the shot is 
deliberate or accidental, whether anyone is hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are our own worst critics, I think," Fetters said. 
</P>
<P>
 When an officer is found in violation of shooting policies, the case is sent 
to Internal Affairs for investigation. But usually only the most serious cases, 
or those in which the officer appeals disciplinary action, are publicly 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some victims advocates believe this shroud of secrecy has allowed LAPD abuses 
to go unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we really disciplining these officers, or are we slapping their wrists?" 
asked Karol Heppe, executive director of Police Watch, a lawyer referral 
service for alleged police victims. "Who's keeping a watch on the trigger-happy 
officers?" 
</P>
<P>
 The department insists that it is. In addition to ordering discipline for 
dozens of officers each year, officials say they also require thousands of 
hours of remedial training for shooting mistakes. Retraining can include a week 
in Tactical Awareness School, or a few days in a firearms "re-familiarization" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the department says that retraining is not punitive, Skaggs of the 
police union said: "The officers view it as being on trial. They don't ever 
feel they need the extra training, and they feel that their career sometimes is 
on the line. That (criticism) goes on your record." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office also reviews police shootings, but criminal 
filings are rare: In 284 LAPD shooting investigations since 1990, prosecutors 
have brought charges once. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Officer Douglas Iversen was charged with murder in the 1992 slaying of 
tow truck driver John Daniels, who was driving away from a gas station as 
Iversen tried to stop him. The officer's trial is pending, and the LAPD has 
relieved him of duty pending an internal review. Tactical Mistakes 
</P>
<P>
 One morning in 1989, just south of Koreatown, two officers chased down a young 
man suspected of robbing a pedestrian at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get your hands up!" one cop shouted at 23-year-old Vaughn Marshall. As 
Marshall approached, one of the officers walked out from behind her car -- 
despite her partner's warning to "keep your cover." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect reached toward his waist, police said. Fearful that his partner 
was exposed to a gunman, the senior officer fired twice. The second round hit 
Marshall on the right side of his skull, killing him. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, it turned out, was not armed. Police found the shooting itself "in 
policy," but they faulted the tactics leading up to it. The junior officer, 
they said, should never have left her cover, and her "poor tactics directly 
precipitated" the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers often ran into problems when they simply tried to do too much, 
displaying a hero's mentality more suited to the movie screen than to the 
streets: 
</P>
<P>
 An officer races after an armed suspect without taking cover, splits from his 
partner and fails to ask for a backup. Then, left to confront a suspect on his 
own, he opts to use his weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad communications posed the most frequent tactical problem, cited in 230 
shootings -- or one in three. Officers neglected to tell their partners that 
someone had a gun. Many did not let their command posts know what they were 
doing. And others did not give adequate orders to suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Tactical problems come up so frequently that LAPD officials sometimes seemed 
exasperated when writing up officers. "Don't split up!" Gates wrote after one 
1990 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mistakes bordered on the bizarre. Like the time an officer threw a 
child's bike at a charging German shepherd before shooting at the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Or when an undercover detective shot out his windshield as he struggled to 
extricate himself from a seat belt while chasing a Van Nuys car thief. Police 
officials ordered "additional training in exiting a vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that although the department often catches glaring shooting 
mistakes, commanders are also quick to criticize some officers who appeared to 
have done a good job, or even acted heroically. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Officers Hilton Henry and Stephen Kehoe apprehended a suspected 
robber who took a 12-year-old girl hostage in east Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers helped free the girl unharmed, and Kehoe took two bullets in a 
shootout with the suspect, putting him out of work for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Willie L. Williams lauded the "courageous and heroic actions" of the 
officers, but ordered training for both because of a series of tactical lapses. 
</P>
<P>
 The most critical: Henry left his car unlocked and running when he first 
confronted the suspect. The wounded suspect jumped in the police car, taking 
the girl. After a few blocks, he rammed into another car and was captured. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, an officer was praised for "exemplary" work in killing a man 
who was raping a woman at scissors-point. But the officer and his partner were 
ordered to undergo training because they did not take cover when confronting 
the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety of the officers demands such admonitions, Fetters said. "We tell 
them: 'On the one hand, you're a hero because you saved a life, but you have to 
remember how exposed you were -- and that if you keep doing it, we're going to 
have to go to your funeral.' " Accidental Shootings 
</P>
<P>
 The driver looked dangerous -- a druggie or "a mental case" -- and he fit the 
description of a wanted burglar, the officer thought as he pulled up behind a 
parked van.  
</P>
<P>
 But, as commanders later concluded, the biggest threat that day in Canoga Park 
five years ago was not the burglary suspect, but a cop with a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 His gun trained, the officer ordered the man out of the van. Then the scene 
turned violent. As the suspect struggled with a second officer, the officer 
leaned his gun against a car bumper and ran over to help. 
</P>
<P>
 When the gun was jostled, it fell and discharged, flattening one of the van's 
tires. No one was hurt, but the chief ordered disciplinary action, saying the 
officer's "handling of the shotgun presented more of a threat to the officers 
than the suspect himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite vigorous firearms training, accidental shootings remain a vexing 
problem: LAPD officers are disciplined at a rate of nearly two a month for 
unintentionally firing their weapons, and that rate climbed 60% for the first 
six months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has completed investigations into 96 accidental shootings since 
1989 -- all but 20 of them on duty. Virtually all led to discipline, usually 
for negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Stressful as police work is, department officials characterize most accidental 
shootings as inexcusable. "Some," said Skaggs of the police union, "are just 
stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider some cases resulting in discipline: 
</P>
<P>
 A SWAT team member, giving an equipment briefing to a visiting delegation of 
South Korean dignitaries, saw a visitor handling a .45-caliber pistol and tried 
to reactivate the safety. Instead, the officer fired a bullet into a nearby 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 An off-duty officer fell asleep at the wheel in Irvine with his hand on his 
gun, which was on the seat. Then he ran into a fence and shot himself in the 
leg. LAPD officials said the gun should have remained holstered. 
</P>
<P>
 After the slaying of a detective, officers were assigned to guard the victim's 
Studio City home. One officer perused a commemorative rifle hung above the TV. 
But he did not check to see if it was loaded, and he fired a round through a 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates sternly noted that the officer was "assigned to protect the residence, 
not manhandle (the slain detective's) treasured belongings." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a stumbled step -- or a sudden alarm, or an elbow from a struggling 
suspect -- has been enough to prompt an officer to fire accidentally. Other 
times, officers have been cleaning their guns, or putting them away, or 
drinking and horsing around with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, records show, the officers broke a "cardinal rule," putting a finger 
on the trigger before there was any need to fire. Their bullets have landed 
everywhere -- in soda machines, in parked cars, in police station lockers and 
in frat-house walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, tragedy has been averted -- such as last year when a stray bullet 
from an officer's gun lodged in a bedroom floor just a few feet from a sleeping 
15-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 But other officers have not been so lucky. At least 17 times since 1989, LAPD 
officers have accidentally wounded themselves or others. Two others have been 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion Jminer Gray, a 52-year-old Compton woman who cares for her 
schizophrenic brother, remembers the horror of seeing him lying in their 
mother's garage one morning four years ago, shot in the leg by an LAPD officer. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials termed the shooting an accident: Three officers, they said, 
were trying to calm the man and bring him to a medical facility. But as he 
resisted and tried to shut a garage door on them, one officer accidentally 
fired his gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer was disciplined, the city agreed to pay the family $65,000 to 
cover the victim's injuries, and the case quietly went away. But, looking back, 
Gray still does not understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was all skin and bones -- maybe a hundred pounds. All they had to do was 
grab him or something," she said. "Why did they have to draw their guns?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing a moment, she said: "I just never thought they would fire." Crossing 
the Thin Blue Line? 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five years, LAPD officers were involved in nearly 700 shootings 
that have been reviewed by the department, and police officials ultimately 
ordered corrective action in three of every four cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the year-by-year breakdowns showing how often the department 
found that a shooting warranted no further action; that at least one officer 
involved in a case needed training because of mistakes; or that at least one 
officer needed disciplining. Year: 1989 Shootings: 152 No Action: 37 Training 
Only: 77 Discipline Required*: 38 Corrective Action (Training or discipline 
required): 75.7% 
</P>
<P>
 * Year: 1990 Shootings: 164 No Action: 36 Training Only: 84 Discipline 
Required*: 44 Corrective Action (Training or discipline required): 78%

<P>
 * Total: Shootings: 694 No Action: 177 Training Only: 334 Discipline 
Required*: 183 Corrective Action (Training or discipline required): 74.5% 
</P>
<P>
 * Some discipline cases also required training.

 The LAPD's internal reviews of department shootings include detailed critiques

shot an unarmed teen-ager, left, to high praise for an officer wounded in a 
shootout with gang members, right.

SPORTS AGENT PLAYS HARD AS LEAGUE LEADER IN HIS GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is just before midnight and sports attorney Leigh Steinberg is, as usual, 
on the phone in his eighth-floor corner office overlooking the Fashion Island 
shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 There is trouble on the other end of the line. One of Steinberg's 
multimillion-dollar National Football League clients has violated NFL rules. If 
discovered, he could be out of the game for a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg does not want that to happen. It would not look good. Before calling 
the frightened player back at training camp, he and fellow attorney David Dunn 
map out a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 A story will be concocted. The scared player will fly home until the whole 
mess blows over. No one will be the wiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know this sounds nightmarish," says Steinberg, adopting a fatherly tone on 
the phone. "But just know that we'll get through this, and we'll get to happier 
days." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg, 45, hangs up the phone and stuffs a wad of chewing tobacco under 
his lower lip. "He's just a young kid," he said. "He's really a great kid. I 
can't allow him to get in trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 It's the last phone call of a 15-hour day for Steinberg, arguably the most 
powerful agent in all of football. His job is negotiating contracts for some of 
the highest-paid players in the game. His specialty is keeping them that way. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg's alphabetized client list starts with the Dallas Cowboys' 
$50-million quarterback Troy Aikman and ends with Steve Young, the San 
Francisco 49ers' $26.75-million signal-caller. In between are 19 quarterbacks 
on 14 of the NFL's 28 teams. It's enough to ensure that Steinberg's phone calls 
are always returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone looking for a quarterback, they're going to end up here," says 
Steinberg, eyeing a map of the United States propped against the wall and 
dotted with black-and-white mug shots of his clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the still-boyish agent has taken on perhaps his toughest client: Orange 
County, a player with shaky stats and questionable commitment. As co-chairman 
of Save the Rams, a local group of businessmen and politicians, he's got just a 
few weeks to renegotiate a contract with the team. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is making his long days longer. 
</P>
<P>
 This one began with the 7 a.m. weekly meeting of Save the Rams at the Anaheim 
Marriott. More than 40 people showed up -- the most ever, an encouraging sign 
to Steinberg that things are on track. 
</P>
<P>
 "People here are so stingy," he says, visibly frustrated. "Part of the problem 
of Orange County is the lack of cultural or geographic cohesiveness. There's a 
sense that what we are geographically is 'not Los Angeles.' " 
</P>
<P>
 By 10:20 a.m., Steinberg, rumpled in stained Calvin Klein jeans, a white "Keep 
our Rams in Orange County" T-shirt and white Reeboks, is back in his office. He 
pops open the day's first Diet Dr. Pepper, which he chain-drinks, alternating 
with jugs of orange Gatorade Light. Cases of the stuff are stacked in adjoining 
offices. 
</P>
<P>
 He slumps back in one of the leather recliners plunked in the middle of his 
office and wedges in the first of many dollops of tobacco, palming the can in 
his hand and clicking it open and closed as he talks. And talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of Steinberg's business is done in this position, usually with his feet 
on his messy desk and a telephone tucked between his cheek and shoulder. His 
famous clients, who now include boxer Oscar de la Hoya and the U.S. Soccer 
Team, stare back at him from framed Sports Illustrated covers, posters and 
pictures hung haphazardly on his walls. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone never rings in his office, one floor below the one occupied by Peter 
Ueberroth, the former baseball commissioner and chief organizer of the 1984 
Summer Olympic Games in Los Angeles. The walls are soundproofed and when a call 
comes in, his assistant opens the door and displays the caller's name in block 
letters on a note card. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes the calls come so continuously, Steinberg says, that he barely has 
time to make his way into the adjoining bathroom, where the countertop is 
littered with bottles of Rolaids, Tums and a half-dozen Old Spice deodorant 
sticks. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Steinberg's firm negotiated $325 million worth of new business 
alone. The firm includes Jeff Moorad, who represents a slate of top baseball 
players, two other attorneys and a rotating crew of about 10 shorts-clad, 
over-educated, mostly female assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg's firm represents more than 130 clients in all, including 
professional sports stars such as San Francisco Giants slugger Matt Williams, 
New York Knicks guard John Starks and Edmonton Oilers goalie Joaquin Gage. He 
also represents most of the big-name television news anchors in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg won't say how much he makes, but the firm takes a 4% cut of football 
deals, a 5% cut of baseball and basketball deals and a 15% cut of endorsement 
contracts. He also rakes in $15,000 per speech on the speaker circuit, and he 
makes dozens each year. When he bills clients an hourly rate, Steinberg charges 
$1,200 to $1,500 an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg notes that he donates to charity all honorariums received from 
schools and student groups. He requires all his clients to donate part of their 
earnings to charity. Steinberg himself gives thousands of dollars to schools 
and other foundations each year, part of his philosophy that he and his clients 
must be role models for society. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Steinberg is focusing on a client whose star has fallen. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan McGwire, the 6-foot-7 backup quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks, is 
about to become a victim of the NFL's new salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a first-round draft pick, McGwire has suffered three unproductive 
seasons, and now the Seahawks want to slice his $1.1-million-a-year contract to 
$400,000 to raise money for another player. Steinberg is trying to get a fix on 
Mickey Loomis, the Seahawks executive vice president proposing the cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is he? What's his title? I've got to get into his head," Steinberg 
ruminates. "Is he going to be judged on whether he's able to move the money 
down? What are they trying to do with the extra money?" 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg's assistants have prepared a list of the salaries of every secondary 
quarterback in the league (the average is $817,000). With McGwire's stats, it's 
going to be tough to keep him at his current salary. 
</P>
<P>
 But $400,000 is insulting -- the fourth lowest in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunn has prepared a script for Steinberg to use called the "McGwire Approach 
to Loomis." But Steinberg knows Loomis can't play hardball -- he'll have to 
deal with Steinberg again. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not as if they can treat the negotiation for McGwire like the typical 
agent-client negotiation," he says. "They're going to have to come right back 
here to somehow fill their needs." 
</P>
<P>
 At 12:55, McGwire calls from training camp. Steinberg reassures him, but says 
he must look at the salary cut "in terms of the whole league. This has probably 
happened with two-thirds the players in the NFL." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten minutes later, Pittsburgh Steelers assistant controller Dan Ferens is on 
the phone. Steinberg tells him that Tom Donahoe, the Steelers' director of 
football operations, has been interfering with his client, defensive back 
Carnell Lake, who is negotiating a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't get that I'm the strongest authority figure in Carnell Lake's 
life," says Steinberg, who also represents two of the Steelers' quarterbacks. 
Donahoe "needs to move into the modern world." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferens assures Steinberg that the situation will be remedied. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg hangs up. Dunn and a summer intern come in for a powwow. 
</P>
<P>
 "You guys are going to laugh at me," Steinberg starts. "What do you think 
about the concept of doing marketing for Rodney King? A possible book and 
movie?" 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg spends a chunk of the afternoon talking to reporters. If they don't 
ask about the Rams, he tells them. Though he's spoken the same words at least a 
dozen times before, he doesn't sound bored. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:50, Frank Michelena, one of the county's most prominent lobbyists, calls 
to tell Steinberg that he has rounded up a coalition of Orange County auto 
dealers to support the Save the Rams effort. They lay plans for Steinberg to 
meet the dealers on Aug. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4 p.m. the Seahawks' Loomis calls back, sounding nervous over the speaker 
phone: "I'm not saying take it or leave it or anything like that." Steinberg 
agrees to get back to Loomis, then hangs up the phone and assigns an assistant 
to talk with the Seahawks until the deal is closer to the $800,000 range. 
</P>
<P>
 At 4:50 p.m., Steinberg dictates a guest column on the Rams for The Times' 
Op-Ed page. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 p.m., he's on the phone telling Philadelphia Eagle's linebacker William 
Thomas that he isn't excited about the team's $2.6-million, three-year contract 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing, William, is about what is your maximum leverage point. Keep 
me abreast of what's going on in the Philadelphia papers," he says. "Anything 
you see or hear, let me know." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg takes a break for take-out Chinese. 
</P>
<P>
 At 8:45 p.m., a white stretch limousine whisks him to CNN's studios in Los 
Angeles for a half-hour call-in show about the baseball strike. A young 
assistant is at the ready, with cans of tobacco, Diet Dr. Pepper and rice cakes 
for the ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg does television talk shows nearly once a week. He is often touted as 
an expert on topics on which, well, he isn't.  
</P>
<P>
 This month, he popped up on "Vicki!", the syndicated talk show featuring Vicki 
Lawrence, one of Carol Burnett's former sidekicks, where he chatted about 
female athletes, though he doesn't represent any. He also appeared on "Larry 
King Live," where he pledged to get his athletes involved in fighting domestic 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "People want someone who can give them good TV," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 By 11:30 p.m., Steinberg is back in his office. He makes plans to be in early 
the next day. There is McGwire's contract to be dealt with, as well as deals 
for Lake and Thomas. Maybe he muses, he can get USA Today to write about the 
Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is still the immediate future of the frightened young client in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "I gotta deal with my guy," Steinberg says. "I can't leave him hanging out 
there like that."

CAN STEINBERG REPEAT GIGANTIC FEAT IN O.C.?; SPORTS: DEAL-MAKER WHO HELPED SAN 
FRANCISCO KEEP ITS BASEBALL TEAM NOW FIGHTING TO RETAIN RAMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was mid-August, 1992, and efforts to keep the San Francisco Giants out of 
the hands of Florida poachers had nearly expired in the hot, waning days of 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitter fans tossed up their hands: Who could compete with an owner's greed? 
Call them the St. Petersburg Giants. End of story. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco Mayor Frank Jordan, desperate to avoid being forever linked to 
the loss, called on mega-sports agent Leigh Steinberg and his fat Rolodex of 
connections. Business bigwigs and politicians rallied, launching a fierce, 
arm-twisting drive that snatched the baseball team back. Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the current campaign to keep the pro football Rams in Orange 
County echoes the battle waged for baseball's Giants two summers earlier. Both 
efforts only got underway after the teams seemed ready to pack up the moving 
vans. Both marshaled diverse groups of the area's wealthiest and most powerful 
people. And both featured the last minute hyper-cheerleading of Newport Beach 
deal-maker Steinberg, 45, perhaps the most powerful attorney in professional 
sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, saving the Giants for San Francisco occupies a prominent spot on 
Steinberg's illustrious resume. He sees himself as the star relief pitcher who 
pulled out a win for a hapless San Francisco squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he is leading an Orange County group's last-ditch bid to save the Rams 
from suitors in St. Louis and Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Can he do it again? 
</P>
<P>
 There are those in San Francisco who say he didn't do it the first time. 
</P>
<P>
 "He kept talking, but he didn't contribute," said Richard Goldman, a San 
Francisco insurance broker who owns a more than $5-million chunk of the Giants. 
"He's got his own business. His own agenda. He's playing his own game." 
</P>
<P>
 But Steinberg says that after the San Francisco battle was won, some investors 
who were "dragged in kicking and screaming" rewrote the story, downplaying the 
roles of those who captured the media spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The team was ultimately saved and everybody in that (investor) group are huge 
heroes," said Steinberg, who maintains a home and office in Berkeley. "The 
problem is they did a revisionist history. . . . And I'm left out of their 
revisionist history. But the fans know who was standing there when everyone was 
making fun (of the effort), so I came out of it feeling good." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Steinberg helped lead the effort, or, as some say, simply hogged the 
headlines, a look at the how an ego-heavy group of San Franciscans were able to 
keep the Giants in town is an instructive handbook for dealing with the big 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is a lesson on how keeping the local ball team happy has become 
America's favorite pastime. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the Rams, the trouble with the Giants started over a stadium. In San 
Francisco, it was Candlestick Park, which the Giants share with the San 
Francisco 49ers football team. 
</P>
<P>
 Candlestick was (and still is) old, often down-to-the-bone cold, windy and 
downright inhospitable. When Mayor Jordan took office on Jan. 8, 1991, his 
predecessor, Art Agnos, left one bit of advice in a note on his desk: "You 
better build a ballpark for the Giants or they're going to leave town." 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a half later, Agnos' parting words looked to be coming true. Giants 
owner Bob Lurie, like Rams' owner Georgia Frontiere, wanted a new stadium and, 
when San Franciscans voted not to give it to him, he vowed to go somewhere that 
would. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as in Orange County, the polls were grim reading. Eighty-five percent of 
the general public believed the Giants were gone. The disgruntled rumblings 
were clear, Jordan recalled: "You have a budget to balance. You have homeless 
people. Let's get on with running the city." 
</P>
<P>
 On June 1, 1992, the night before San Jose voters were to decide whether to 
build Lurie a $250-million stadium, Jordan's three top advisers met in San 
Francisco City Hall. They were convinced that if the San Jose measure failed 
Lurie would try to sell the team, which was losing about $7 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Clint Reilly, Jordan's chief political adviser, put in a call to real estate 
developer Walter Shorenstein, a savvy deal-maker and one of the richest and 
best-connected men in town. Shorenstein agreed to round up local investors. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend of Shorenstein's hooked him up with H. Irving Grousbeck, a Stanford 
business professor who had made a fortune in the cable TV industry. Lurie 
agreed to send Grousbeck, who'd always wanted to run a pro ball franchise, the 
team's books. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Grousbeck waited for the financial records, Corey Busch, the Giants 
executive vice president, was jetting cross-country, meeting with potential 
buyers. Every plane stop was detailed by the local newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like he was banging his chest and saying, 'In your face, San 
Francisco. Look at all these people who want to buy the team,' " remembers Ron 
Blatman, then Jordan's director of business planning. 
</P>
<P>
 By late July, Busch had narrowed his choices, meeting secretly with St. 
Petersburg city officials and Tampa Bay investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Then on Aug. 7, Lurie dropped a bombshell: He had agreed to sell the team to 
the Florida investors, who had already sold 30,000 season tickets, and not to 
negotiate with any other buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember seeing a limousine pull up to a jet at San Francisco Airport on TV 
and the newscaster saying that the team had been sold," Jordan said. "Bob Lurie 
told me, 'I'm sorry, I don't think you could match the $115 million I've been 
offered, so I signed the contract already.' " 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later Grousbeck pulled out, stating publicly that the Giants were a 
financial sieve and anyone would be a fool to buy the team. The investor group 
was in disarray. 
</P>
<P>
 Crushed, Jordan called on Steinberg, whom he had heard talking about the team 
on the radio, and Goldman, Jordan's friend and chief of protocol.  
</P>
<P>
 "Jordan calls me and said, 'You've got to help me. You've got to lead this. We 
have to change the public image,' " recalls Steinberg, who also has joined the 
effort to keep the Oakland A's from moving. "The first key was to make people 
believe there was a chance to save it. I just hit the airwaves." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan was counting on Steinberg -- as are folks in Orange County -- to do 
what he does best: schmooze with the league's other owners, who, for all their 
power, could ill afford to brush off the man whose firm represents a couple 
dozen top ball players and 19 of the National Football League's quarterbacks. 
Steinberg's job: convince the rest of the baseball league that San Francisco 
investors had the wherewithal to buy the Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were coached by the commissioner of baseball that as long as a credible 
offer was put forth, baseball would not allow the team to leave," said Blatman, 
who now runs a San Francisco merchant bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The local investors also knew the baseball owners stood to lose significant 
revenue if the Gaints moved from the nation's fourth-largest television market 
-- a factor also at play in a potential Rams move. 
</P>
<P>
 The group launched a public relations blitz, similar to the one just getting 
underway in Orange County. Steinberg was all over the radio talk shows. The 
group bought billboards and mailed so many postcards to the baseball 
commissioner and team owners that some owners called Jordan begging him to 
stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the same day Grousbeck dropped out, Blatman received a phone call 
from the assistant of George Shinn, the wisecracking, born-again Christian 
owner of the Charlotte Hornets pro basketball team in North Carolina. Shinn was 
interested in the Giants. Larry Baer, a friend of Blatman's and Steinberg's and 
a CBS television executive, flew out to meet with Shinn. 
</P>
<P>
 Things suddenly were turning around. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Shinn told the would-be San Francisco investors, now 
numbering more than a dozen, how he would market the Giants so they'd make a 
pot of money, even at Candlestick. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorenstein grilled the ebullient Shinn over his somewhat mysterious finances, 
a quizzing Shinn later likened publicly to a proctology exam. Shinn would put 
up $20 million and other investors, among them some of the biggest of San 
Francisco's bigwigs -- Goldman, Shorenstein, discount broker Charles Schwab and 
Donald Fisher, head of the Gap -- would put up chunks of up to $5 million a 
piece. The remaining $35 million would come from a bank loan. 
</P>
<P>
 Safeway chairman Peter Magowan resigned from his 11-year stint on the Giants 
board of directors to join the investor group. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman said some of the investors had never even been to a ball game and most 
went in believing the only income they would get out of the team was "psychic 
income," or the goodwill of the community for keeping the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, local newspapers were running nostalgic stories about the last 
season in San Francisco and writing profiles of former Giants' greats. ESPN was 
out at the ballpark covering the last games. The local group's last ditch 
effort was simply "smoke and mirrors," the headlines said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times when I went for months where the newspapers said I was 
wasting my time, that the deal was collapsing," Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the deal came together just in time. At the baseball owners meeting in the 
second week of September, the owners voted to put off ruling on the Tampa 
Bay-St. Petersburg offer for the Giants while the San Francisco bid was coming 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 The respite was short-lived. On Oct. 2, Shinn shocked his fellow investors by 
announcing his cost-cutting measures: getting rid of some of the most popular 
players on the team, including first baseman Will Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, the San Francisco investors, gaining confidence they could 
handle the ball team on their own, convinced Shinn to bow out. But Shinn had 
been the needed catalyst. In a three-day whirlwind, the once-skittish money men 
roped in more investors or upped their own stakes to cover Shinn's $20 million. 
A local television station signed up, as did a popular radio station. Magowan 
stepped up as the managing partner. 
</P>
<P>
 In the middle of October, the owners approved the sale of the Giants to the 
local group for $100 million. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was so close so many times for them going to St. Petersburg," recalled 
Goldman, 74. "It's even hard to believe now that we prevailed." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, say players in the battle, it was a combination of ego-wrangling, 
persistence and the dogged optimism of Jordan that saved the Giants. In 
retelling the story, many of the players recount their roles with a pride of 
ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 To Steinberg it was a battle lost until he came on board. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it was most critical, Larry (Baer) and I got the effort on track and 
rolling again," Steinberg said. "In terms of the public, I was the spokesman 
that kept this stuff alive." 
</P>
<P>
 Noah Griffin , the mayor's spokesman, said Steinberg "kept hope alive. He was 
the Jesse Jackson factor in the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 But others tread lightly on the topic of how big a role Steinberg played in 
the battle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever there was a camera, he was there. But that was the only time he was 
there," Blatman said. "But everybody had somewhat of a role to play. Steinberg 
was a cheerleader and he was good at it."

LAPD OFFICERS FAULTED IN 3 OF 4 SHOOTING CASES; POLICE: OFFICIALS SAY FIGURES 
ARE HIGH BECAUSE OF AGGRESSIVE ATTEMPT TO WEED OUT PROBLEMS AND CORRECT FLAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three out of every four times that Los Angeles police officers fire their 
weapons, superiors fault them for potentially life-threatening mistakes that 
warrant retraining or discipline, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 Many officers succumbed to what one union leader called "the John Wayne 
Syndrome," according to a Times review of nearly 700 shooting reports since 
1989. They tended to be too aggressive, abandoning well-established safeguards 
when moving into armed confrontations. 
</P>
<P>
 One officer fired at a possible burglar from nearly a football field away. 
Another shot an unarmed teen-ager who was displaying nothing resembling a 
weapon. Three others shot out their own windshields while trying to stop 
suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 A range of tactical errors, from poor communication to failure to take cover, 
may have led to dozens of other unnecessary shootings by officers in the Los 
Angeles Police Department, internal reports show. 
</P>
<P>
 One officer mistakenly shot another in the back as they converged in the 
darkness on an unarmed suspect. Commanders later blamed the incident on an 
"oversight": The officers had not turned on their flashlights. 
</P>
<P>
 And in nearly 100 cases, on- and off-duty officers accidentally fired their 
weapons, sometimes resulting in injuries or deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 An off-duty officer, leaving for the Persian Gulf War, wanted to give a friend 
a bullet from his .38-caliber revolver as a goodby memento. The gun misfired, 
and the officer shot her through the thigh. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD officials have ruled that most non-accidental shootings were justified 
because the officers believed that lives were in danger when they pulled the 
trigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they acknowledge some training weaknesses, officials maintain that 
the high rate of errors is chiefly a reflection of the department's overarching 
efforts to critique its own officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "People think we shined every shooting on like we weren't paying attention," 
said former Police Chief Daryl F. Gates, who signed off on hundreds of shooting 
reports before resigning under fire in 1992. "The fact is, we were 
hypercritical. . . . Every miscue is cited so we could learn from it." A 
Recurring Issue 
</P>
<P>
 Police shootings have proved a recurring issue in Los Angeles since 1979 when 
two police officers fatally shot Eulia Love, who was armed with a kitchen 
knife. This month, an LAPD officer shot and killed a man who was carrying a toy 
gun, prompting criticisms from some witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Rodney G. King beating in 1991, the Christopher Commission urged 
reforms involving the LAPD's use-of-force policies, including those for 
firearms. The department pledged a new use-of-force manual, but it is not yet 
completed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times found in reviewing 694 internal LAPD reports that shooting-related 
mistakes are no less frequent today than five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 No action was deemed necessary in 25% of the cases. More than half of all 
shootings led to retraining, while a quarter resulted in punishment, including 
reprimand, suspension or dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 Although policies vary among law enforcement agencies, data from several 
suggests that officers in Los Angeles are cited for shooting-related mistakes 
far more frequently than elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach police officials ordered training or administrative review to 
correct mistakes in less than half of recent police shootings. Chicago took 
action in about one in five shootings, and the Orange County Sheriff's 
Department in less than one in 10. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Sheriff's Department releases less information about shootings 
than the LAPD. But the available records indicate that the Sheriff's 
Department, with almost as many officers as the LAPD, reports roughly half the 
number of shooting incidents each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigations of 25 sheriff's shootings resulted in discipline against three 
deputies in the second half of last year -- less than half the LAPD's rate for 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear whether the numbers reflect disparities in the frequency of 
firearms-related errors, or the vigor of departments in addressing them. 
</P>
<P>
 The LAPD does appear to take a tougher approach to post-shooting training than 
some other departments. Training at some agencies usually means a supervisor 
simply sits down with an officer to talk about the shooting, while other 
departments forgo training altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 In Chicago, officers in shootings are either disciplined or cleared; there is 
no retraining. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with such differences, one U.S. Justice Department official who 
specializes in tracking law enforcement data said the LAPD numbers still seem 
unusually high: "It says either there was a lack of training, or . . . a lack 
of supervision when it came to the use of (deadly) force." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, who as vice chairman of the Public Safety 
Committee reviews police activities, said he too was surprised by the numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this suggests to me is that force might not have been necessary in many 
of these shootings if individuals were better trained," Ridley-Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Chief Lawrence E. Fetters, who heads the in-house shooting review 
panel, blamed many shooting errors on training deficiencies caused by high 
turnover on the 7,500-officer force. He noted a decline in the experience level 
among training officers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes," he said, "it's kind of like the blind leading the blind." 
Needless Gunfire 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Tate had worked for years as an actor, with bit roles in movies and TV, 
even an award-winning off-Broadway performance. But by 1991, the parts had 
stopped coming in, and Tate was sweating his days away at two fast-food jobs 
and sleeping under tattered blankets on the floor of an abandoned South-Central 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the police came at 2 a.m. on March 23.  
</P>
<P>
 They had gotten a call -- groundless, it turned out -- that there was a body 
in the house, and two officers went inside. All the 59-year-old Tate knew was 
that there were two men with flashlights, raising a ruckus in the next room. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is it?" demanded a groggy Tate, still wearing his Pizza Hut uniform. 
</P>
<P>
 "Police! Get your ass out here!" came the response, according to a deposition 
Tate gave two years ago. "Come out and take your hands out of your pockets!" 
</P>
<P>
 Tate did, but too quickly, and Officer Garland Hardeman fired, police said. 
The officers said they believed the belligerent suspect was reaching for a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I took my hands out of my pocket and the next thing I know I heard something 
like a hand clap, and I fell on the floor," Tate recalled. "There was a big 
gaping wound in my leg. . . . I said, 'I did what you wanted, and you shot me.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Police officials later found the shooting unwarranted, records show, and they 
suspended Hardeman for five days. 
</P>
<P>
 Tate won a $150,000 settlement from the city. But he walked with a cane after 
two surgeries and a month in the hospital. Earlier this year, after he 
apparently had cashed a disability check, he was killed by muggers in 
Hollywood, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tate mishap is one of 58 shootings over the last five years in which the 
department issued its most serious finding: An officer was not justified in 
using deadly force because there was no immediate threat to anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, an officer answering a gang call shot and killed a teacher's aide after 
mistaking a "dark object" for a gun; it turned out to be a camera. In other 
cases, a glove and a chrome-plated comb prompted police to shoot. 
</P>
<P>
 In one 1990 confrontation with suspected car strippers, a police officer shot 
an unarmed teen-ager in the abdomen. The officer said the youth appeared to be 
reaching for a gun. But Chief Gates disciplined the officer after finding that 
he "did not see him holding anything that could even be construed as a weapon." 
The teen-ager was not charged, and the city agreed to a $1.4-million 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "The common thread I've seen," said attorney Jeffrey Galen, who represented 
Tate and others in lawsuits against police, "is you see officers jumping the 
gun, shooting and asking questions later." 
</P>
<P>
 Between 1989 and 1993, records show, the LAPD reported 127 fatalities in 
officer-involved shootings. Last year, the city agreed to pay $5.6 million to 
settle police shootings, more than half of all police litigation payouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Unwarranted shootings, representing about one in 10 of all non-accidental 
shootings, often occurred at the close of a car chase, in a suspected drug 
house, or at the end of a dark alley as officers answered a call. 
</P>
<P>
 But others came after hours, when officers were off duty. During an argument 
at her home, an officer fired into a Teddy bear. During a traffic dispute, 
another officer sprayed 13 rounds across a busy street, wounding three people 
in the other car. 
</P>
<P>
 A third off-duty officer went on what investigators described as "an 
aggressive, armed quest" after spotting a "beer run" robbery at a convenience 
store. Aided by his armed son, he ended up in a shootout with the bandits and 
was wounded in the head. The department disciplined him for shooting without 
cause. 
</P>
<P>
 In dozens of cases where officers did have reasons to shoot, the department 
found problems in the execution. Officers sometimes fired too many rounds or 
endangered bystanders by shooting at moving vehicles. One officer fired at a 
fleeing suspect from 283 feet away on a Downtown street. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a precept of policing that officers should use their guns only as a last 
resort -- when lives are in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 At the LAPD, where 22 on-duty officers have been killed in the last decade, 
even warning shots are discouraged in all but the most dire situations. Many 
officers pride themselves on never using their weapons during years of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some departments, the LAPD investigates all "officer-involved 
shootings," whether the officer is on duty or off, whether the shot is 
deliberate or accidental, whether anyone is hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are our own worst critics, I think," Fetters said. 
</P>
<P>
 When an officer is found in violation of shooting policies, the case is sent 
to Internal Affairs for investigation. But usually only the most serious cases, 
or those in which the officer appeals disciplinary action, are publicly 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Some victims advocates believe this shroud of secrecy has allowed LAPD abuses 
to go unchecked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are we really disciplining these officers, or are we slapping their wrists?" 
asked Karol Heppe, executive director of Police Watch, a lawyer referral 
service for alleged police victims. "Who's keeping a watch on the trigger-happy 
officers?" 
</P>
<P>
 The department insists that it is. In addition to ordering discipline for 
dozens of officers each year, officials say they also require thousands of 
hours of remedial training for shooting mistakes. Retraining can include a week 
in Tactical Awareness School, or a few days in a firearms "re-familiarization" 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the department says that retraining is not punitive, Skaggs of the 
police union said: "The officers view it as being on trial. They don't ever 
feel they need the extra training, and they feel that their career sometimes is 
on the line. That (criticism) goes on your record." 
</P>
<P>
 The district attorney's office also reviews police shootings, but criminal 
filings are rare: In 284 LAPD shooting investigations since 1990, prosecutors 
have brought charges once. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran Officer Douglas Iversen was charged with murder in the 1992 slaying of 
tow truck driver John Daniels, who was driving away from a gas station as 
Iversen tried to stop him. The officer's trial is pending, and the LAPD has 
relieved him of duty pending an internal review. Tactical Mistakes 
</P>
<P>
 One morning in 1989, just south of Koreatown, two officers chased down a young 
man suspected of robbing a pedestrian at gunpoint. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get your hands up!" one cop shouted at 23-year-old Vaughn Marshall. As 
Marshall approached, one of the officers walked out from behind her car -- 
despite her partner's warning to "keep your cover." 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect reached toward his waist, police said. Fearful that his partner 
was exposed to a gunman, the senior officer fired twice. The second round hit 
Marshall on the right side of his skull, killing him. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, it turned out, was not armed. Police found the shooting itself "in 
policy," but they faulted the tactics leading up to it. The junior officer, 
they said, should never have left her cover, and her "poor tactics directly 
precipitated" the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers often ran into problems when they simply tried to do too much, 
displaying a hero's mentality more suited to the movie screen than to the 
streets: 
</P>
<P>
 An officer races after an armed suspect without taking cover, splits from his 
partner and fails to ask for a backup. Then, left to confront a suspect on his 
own, he opts to use his weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad communications posed the most frequent tactical problem, cited in 230 
shootings -- or one in three. Officers neglected to tell their partners that 
someone had a gun. Many did not let their command posts know what they were 
doing. And others did not give adequate orders to suspects. 
</P>
<P>
 Tactical problems come up so frequently that LAPD officials sometimes seemed 
exasperated when writing up officers. "Don't split up!" Gates wrote after one 
1990 shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Some mistakes bordered on the bizarre. Like the time an officer threw a 
child's bike at a charging German shepherd before shooting at the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Or when an undercover detective shot out his windshield as he struggled to 
extricate himself from a seat belt while chasing a Van Nuys car thief. Police 
officials ordered "additional training in exiting a vehicle." 
</P>
<P>
 Records show that although the department often catches glaring shooting 
mistakes, commanders are also quick to criticize some officers who appeared to 
have done a good job, or even acted heroically. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Officers Hilton Henry and Stephen Kehoe apprehended a suspected 
robber who took a 12-year-old girl hostage in east Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers helped free the girl unharmed, and Kehoe took two bullets in a 
shootout with the suspect, putting him out of work for two months. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Willie L. Williams lauded the "courageous and heroic actions" of the 
officers, but ordered training for both because of a series of tactical lapses. 
</P>
<P>
 The most critical: Henry left his car unlocked and running when he first 
confronted the suspect. The wounded suspect jumped in the police car, taking 
the girl. After a few blocks, he rammed into another car and was captured. 
</P>
<P>
 In another case, an officer was praised for "exemplary" work in killing a man 
who was raping a woman at scissors-point. But the officer and his partner were 
ordered to undergo training because they did not take cover when confronting 
the suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety of the officers demands such admonitions, Fetters said. "We tell 
them: 'On the one hand, you're a hero because you saved a life, but you have to 
remember how exposed you were -- and that if you keep doing it, we're going to 
have to go to your funeral.' " Accidental Shootings 
</P>
<P>
 The driver looked dangerous -- a druggie or "a mental case" -- and he fit the 
description of a wanted burglar, the officer thought as he pulled up behind a 
parked van.  
</P>
<P>
 But, as commanders later concluded, the biggest threat that day in Canoga Park 
five years ago was not the burglary suspect, but a cop with a shotgun. 
</P>
<P>
 His gun trained, the officer ordered the man out of the van. Then the scene 
turned violent. As the suspect struggled with a second officer, the officer 
leaned his gun against a car bumper and ran over to help. 
</P>
<P>
 When the gun was jostled, it fell and discharged, flattening one of the van's 
tires. No one was hurt, but the chief ordered disciplinary action, saying the 
officer's "handling of the shotgun presented more of a threat to the officers 
than the suspect himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite vigorous firearms training, accidental shootings remain a vexing 
problem: LAPD officers are disciplined at a rate of nearly two a month for 
unintentionally firing their weapons, and that rate climbed 60% for the first 
six months of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The department has completed investigations into 96 accidental shootings since 
1989 -- all but 20 of them on duty. Virtually all led to discipline, usually 
for negligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Stressful as police work is, department officials characterize most accidental 
shootings as inexcusable. "Some," said Skaggs of the police union, "are just 
stupidity." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider some cases resulting in discipline: 
</P>
<P>
 A SWAT team member, giving an equipment briefing to a visiting delegation of 
South Korean dignitaries, saw a visitor handling a .45-caliber pistol and tried 
to reactivate the safety. Instead, the officer fired a bullet into a nearby 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 An off-duty officer fell asleep at the wheel in Irvine with his hand on his 
gun, which was on the seat. Then he ran into a fence and shot himself in the 
leg. LAPD officials said the gun should have remained holstered. 
</P>
<P>
 After the slaying of a detective, officers were assigned to guard the victim's 
Studio City home. One officer perused a commemorative rifle hung above the TV. 
But he did not check to see if it was loaded, and he fired a round through a 
painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates sternly noted that the officer was "assigned to protect the residence, 
not manhandle (the slain detective's) treasured belongings." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes a stumbled step -- or a sudden alarm, or an elbow from a struggling 
suspect -- has been enough to prompt an officer to fire accidentally. Other 
times, officers have been cleaning their guns, or putting them away, or 
drinking and horsing around with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, records show, the officers broke a "cardinal rule," putting a finger 
on the trigger before there was any need to fire. Their bullets have landed 
everywhere -- in soda machines, in parked cars, in police station lockers and 
in frat-house walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, tragedy has been averted -- such as last year when a stray bullet 
from an officer's gun lodged in a bedroom floor just a few feet from a sleeping 
15-year-old girl. 
</P>
<P>
 But other officers have not been so lucky. At least 17 times since 1989, LAPD 
officers have accidentally wounded themselves or others. Two others have been 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion Jminer Gray, a 52-year-old Compton woman who cares for her 
schizophrenic brother, remembers the horror of seeing him lying in their 
mother's garage one morning four years ago, shot in the leg by an LAPD officer. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials termed the shooting an accident: Three officers, they said, 
were trying to calm the man and bring him to a medical facility. But as he 
resisted and tried to shut a garage door on them, one officer accidentally 
fired his gun. 
</P>
<P>
 The officer was disciplined, the city agreed to pay the family $65,000 to 
cover the victim's injuries, and the case quietly went away. But, looking back, 
Gray still does not understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was all skin and bones -- maybe a hundred pounds. All they had to do was 
grab him or something," she said. "Why did they have to draw their guns?" 
</P>
<P>
 Pausing a moment, she said: "I just never thought they would fire." Crossing 
the Thin Blue Line? 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five years, LAPD officers were involved in nearly 700 shootings 
that have been reviewed by the department, and police officials ultimately 
ordered corrective action in three of every four cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the year-by-year breakdowns showing how often the department 
found that a shooting warranted no further action; that at least one officer 
involved in a case needed training because of mistakes; or that at least one 
officer needed disciplining. Year: 1989 Shootings: 152 No Action: 37 Training 
Only: 77 Discipline Required*: 38 Corrective Action (Training or discipline 
required): 75.7% 
</P>
<P>

NATO CHIEF WOERNER DIES; PRESIDED AT COLD WAR'S END; EUROPE: FORMER WEST GERMAN 
DEFENSE MINISTER WAS 59. HE GUIDED ALLIANCE'S SEARCH FOR NEW SECURITY ROLE IN 
THE '90S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Manfred Woerner, the former West German defense minister who led the North 
Atlantic Treaty Organization for six crucial years that spanned the end of the 
Cold War and the collapse of the Soviet Union, died Saturday following a long 
battle with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued at NATO headquarters here said Woerner, 59, died at his 
home in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under his skillful and strong leadership, he has led the transformation of 
the alliance from an era of confrontation during the Cold War to the present 
period of cooperation and partnership," the statement said. "He was the driving 
force behind NATO's transformation." 
</P>
<P>
 As NATO secretary general from July, 1988, until his death, Woerner presided 
over the alliance's search for a new role in European security, helping former 
adversaries enter into formal working relationships with the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a key figure in turning President Clinton's idea of building links to 
these nations into a successful initiative, known as "Partnership for Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Woerner's visible loss of strength and prolonged absences from his 
office at NATO headquarters here in recent months, the announcement of his 
death came as a shock.  
</P>
<P>
 Only last month, he had informed ambassadors from the alliance's 16 member 
nations that he was recovering and planned to resume a normal schedule next 
month.  
</P>
<P>
 His passing marks the first time that a NATO secretary general has died in 
office, and it leaves the alliance without strong leadership at a time when its 
future is filled with question marks, for many of the changes that Woerner 
helped initiate are only now being implemented. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a successor is found, the alliance will be headed by Deputy Secretary 
General Sergio Balanzino, an Italian career diplomat with virtually no 
experience in military affairs who arrived at NATO only last January. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers say Woerner's possible successors include Norway's Thorvald 
Stoltenberg, a former foreign minister and currently U.N. peace mediator in the 
Balkans, and former Italian Prime Minister Giuliano Amato. 
</P>
<P>
 Tributes to Woerner followed quickly after the announcement that he had lost 
his fight with cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was a true and loyal friend of the United States," Clinton said in a 
written statement. ". . . Manfred Woerner's heroic leadership made an enduring 
contribution to democracy and security in Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali lauded Woerner's "wisdom, 
integrity and humanity," while Chancellor Helmut Kohl called him "a guardian of 
Western steadfastness at the time of the Cold War." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he lacked the political stature and the easy humor of his immediate 
predecessor, Britain's Peter Carrington, Woerner relied on an iron will, 
personal courage and an unwavering commitment to the transatlantic relationship 
to steer NATO through the swiftly changing currents of the immediate post-Cold 
War era. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I began, I wasn't even allowed to receive an ambassador from the Warsaw 
Pact," he once commented, referring to the Soviet-led alliance of Communist 
nations that opposed NATO for more than four decades.  
</P>
<P>
 From his office in the sprawling NATO headquarters here, he would witness the 
end of the Warsaw Pact and welcome not just the ambassadors but the leaders of 
pact nations. 
</P>
<P>
 In early 1992, he began a struggle against cancer of the intestine that 
gradually sapped his strength and radically curtailed an active lifestyle that 
had combined flying, sports and consistent 16-hour workdays. 
</P>
<P>
 His handling of this illness reflected his personal courage. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had lost nearly 40 pounds and was suffering intense pain, twice 
this year, in February and April, he defied doctors' orders and chaired 
important NATO meetings that committed the alliance to enforce certain U.N. 
resolutions in the former Yugoslav federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw there was finally a chance to do something and not just talk," he later 
explained to an interviewer. "What the effort did to me was immaterial."  
</P>
<P>
 According to those who worked with him, Woerner viewed the war in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina as a chance for the alliance to prove it could play an 
active, constructive role in the post-Cold War era. 
</P>
<P>
 He reportedly became first enraged, then deeply disappointed, at the United 
Nations' reluctance to use NATO air power to enforce weapons exclusion zones 
around the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, and the eastern town of Gorazde.  
</P>
<P>
 It was under his stewardship that NATO engaged in offensive military action 
for the first time in its history when, on Feb. 28, 1994, alliance F-16s first 
challenged, then shot down four Serbian aircraft that had violated a 
U.N.-declared "no-fly" zone over Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "People will learn to respect NATO," Woerner said on the night of the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Although serious differences between NATO and U.N. commanders blunted the 
alliance's role in its first major mission outside a member country, Woerner is 
credited with keeping NATO's reputation and internal unity largely intact. 
</P>
<P>
 "He absolutely refused to let the alliance get bounced into that conflict 
until the individual governments were committed," the ambassador of one member 
nation said. 
</P>
<P>
 But many argued that his greatest single achievement was to nurture the 
consensus among the alliance's 16 partners that allowed NATO to survive its own 
success -- the defeat of communism in Europe -- and remain a key stabilizing 
factor in the less certain world of the 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
 "East or west, north or south, everyone in Europe is still convinced that NATO 
is the only military alliance of any importance," noted Jonathan Eyal, director 
of studies at the London-based Royal United Services Institute. "And that's not 
a small feat." 
</P>
<P>
 Woerner was born in the southwest German city of Stuttgart on Sept. 24, 1934. 
Although too young to fight in World War II, he experienced the war as a 
preteen, huddled in underground shelters during Allied bombings of Nazi 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young adult, he once thought of going into the clergy but instead studied 
law in Munich. He quickly became active in politics, joining the conservative 
Christian Democrats at age 22.  
</P>
<P>
 Woerner found work as a legal adviser to the legislature of his home state of 
Baden-Wurttemberg and eventually entered the federal Parliament at age 31. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he initially specialized in education policy, he soon became involved 
in defense matters. He earned his wings as a jet fighter pilot in the mid-1960s 
and by the mid-1970s had become his party's main spokesman on defense matters. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Christian Democrats toppled Chancellor Helmut Schmidt's center-left 
coalition and regained power in West Germany in late 1982, Woerner was named 
defense minister in Kohl's first Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a job he held throughout the tumultuous demonstrations in Germany that 
accompanied the stationing of American medium-range nuclear missiles in the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 Woerner backed the missile deployment and later became a rare European backer 
of former President Ronald Reagan's controversial Strategic Defense Initiative 
-- positions that caused frequent street protests against him. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was scandal, not protests, that nearly ended Woerner's political 
career. His decision in late 1983 to summarily dismiss one of the armed forces' 
most senior generals, Guenter Kiessling, amid accusations that he had 
frequented gay bars backfired when the charges proved false. 
</P>
<P>
 Woerner had brushed aside the general's strenuous rejection of the accusations 
and sacked Kiessling, claiming he was a security risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Woerner survived only because Kohl refused to bow to public calls for his 
resignation.  
</P>
<P>
 Years later, East German secret police records were found suggesting that the 
allegations may have been planted by the Communists in hopes of undermining the 
hard-line defense minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Woerner relished his image as an unbending hawk and ardent cold warrior -- an 
image he gained mainly when he became a prime target of his country's powerful 
peace movement in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at NATO, however, he became an effective consensus builder, constantly 
searching for the middle ground needed to keep the alliance together, yet still 
moving it forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was a great secretary general," Eyal said. "He was one of the 
first to grasp the alliance needed to change, but knew that if he pushed too 
hard, too quickly, it could all break apart."  
</P>
<P>
 While the alliance's structure changed considerably during Woerner's years at 
the helm, there was much he failed to alter. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he liked to joke that his weight loss made him "leaner and meaner" -- 
much like the new NATO -- he never really managed to get rid of the 
organization's unwieldy central bureaucracy despite sharp post-Cold War defense 
cuts among member nations. 
</P>
<P>
 He was also unable to persuade the alliance's 16 member nations to coordinate 
their military cutbacks to maintain the maximum possible strength. Instead, 
each reduced its forces according to its individual needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, until the end, he remained a tough, respected leader of the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 After a recalcitrant Russian ambassador kept a meeting of NATO and its eastern 
partners bogged down this June for hours in petty debate during one of the long 
spells when Woerner was hospitalized, one frustrated alliance representative 
emerged from the room and muttered, "Woerner never would have let him (the 
Russian) get away with this."

INFECTIONS MAY HIT 10 MILLION BY 2000. MANY DOCTORS IN JAPAN REFUSE TO TREAT 
VICTIMS.

 Toshihiro Oishi is very lonely. 
</P>
<P>
 Oishi is one of only two self-acknowledged AIDS victims in Japan. Two others 
came out of the closet as well, but they have died, leaving Oishi and one other 
as the lone public symbols of Japan's 764 AIDS patients and 3,075 
HIV-positives. 
</P>
<P>
 The young photographer, who contracted AIDS from blood products used to 
control his hemophilia, is nearly blind in one eye, the result of a 
cytomegalovirus infection. But he is still vigorous, devoting his free time to 
bringing AIDS awareness to Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a difficult fight. "It is not easy for a person with AIDS or HIV to live 
in Japanese society," Oishi said. "Japanese society is still very far from 
being (empathetic) to persons with AIDS and HIV, as evidenced by the fact that, 
since my announcement (at last year's AIDS conference in Berlin), no Japanese 
with AIDS or HIV has made his or her disease known to the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Oishi addressed last Sunday's opening session of the 10th International 
Conference on AIDS. His talk struck a poignant chord at the meeting, which was 
marked by pessimism about the spread of the disease and a scattering of 
encouraging, if preliminary, scientific results. 
</P>
<P>
 During his speech, Oishi asked everyone in the audience who was HIV-positive 
or who had AIDS to stand. The group received a warm and sustained round of 
applause from the audience, which included Crown Prince Naruhito and Crown 
Princess Masako. 
</P>
<P>
 But behind this appearance of openness, observers say, is an undercurrent of 
fear and distrust, a bitter resentment of the "Westernized morals" that many 
Japanese believe lie behind the impending AIDS epidemic. A significant number 
of physicians in Japan refuse to treat AIDS victims, and many hospitals will 
not accept them, government officials acknowledge. "We have a proven history of 
extremely intense discrimination against AIDS," said Dr. Kenzu Kiikuni of Tokyo 
Women's Medical College. "That's got to change." 
</P>
<P>
 This contradictory attitude of public openness but private rejection of AIDS 
as a public health problem is typical of the Eastern response to the disease at 
the first AIDS conference held in Asia, experts say. Public health officials 
from throughout the region talk of educational programs, condom distribution 
and other proactive measures, but in private they deny that their countries are 
threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 "The denial here is as great as it has been anywhere else in the world," said 
Dr. Michael H. Merson, head of the World Health Organization's Global Programme 
on AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 But the facts fly in the face of the denial. In the last 12 months, according 
to WHO, 3 million more people worldwide have become infected with the human 
immunodeficiency virus, which causes AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cumulative number of HIV infections to date exceeds 17 million 
worldwide," said Dr. Hiroshi Nakajima, director-general of WHO. "If the present 
trend continues, the figure will . . . reach 30 (million) to 40 million by the 
year 2000." 
</P>
<P>
 Asia will carry an increasing share of that burden. In the past year, the 
number of AIDS cases in Southeast Asia has risen from 30,000 to 250,000. 
Moreover, WHO predicts that the number of HIV infections in all of Asia -- now 
about 2.5 million -- could quadruple to 10 million by 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The suffering from the disease will be economic as well as human. According to 
McGraw Hill, the New York-based publisher and information service purveyor, the 
epidemic could cost Asian economies up to $52 billion directly and in lost 
productivity through the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 But that is "only half of the story," according to Dr. Arata Kochi, head of 
WHO's Tuberculosis Programme. "It gets a lot worse" when tuberculosis is 
considered in the equation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fully 30% of Asians -- as many as 50% in some regions -- are infected by the 
TB bacterium, but live their lives without becoming sick because the bacteria 
are trapped inside blood cells "like a cobra in a basket with the lid fastened 
on," Kochi said. "HIV is like an evil genie that goes around the body pulling 
the lids off all the millions of baskets." 
</P>
<P>
 An HIV-positive person who is already infected with TB is 30 times more likely 
to get sick with tuberculosis than one who is HIV-negative, he said. And each 
of those people who get sick, if not treated, will infect 10 to 20 additional 
people within a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Asia, the number of annual TB deaths in (HIV- and TB-) infected people is 
doubling every three years," he said. "We expect Asia to surpass Africa in the 
number of annual TB/HIV deaths by the year 2000."  
</P>
<P>
 Merson said: "We have a very narrow window of opportunity to prevent an (AIDS) 
epidemic in Asia and it is closing fast."  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the most pessimistic of all at the meeting was Dr. Jonathan M. Mann of 
Harvard University, who was the first head of WHO's Programme on AIDS. Even if 
all the envisioned educational and control programs were implemented in 
developing countries, he said, they would fail to halt the impending 
catastrophe because they do not take into account human rights issues, 
especially the rights of women. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the estimated 1.4 million people who contracted AIDS last year, more than a 
third were women, according to the Global AIDS Policy Coalition, based at 
Harvard University. Although HIV-infected men now outnumber HIV-infected women 
3 to 2, according to WHO, the gap is closing and "equality" should be reached 
by the turn of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 And a cruel, ironic equality it is. Throughout the developing world, speakers 
said, women are subject to the whims of fathers, brothers, husbands and pimps, 
with no divorce or inheritance rights of their own. Men often feel no 
responsibility to the women -- whom they view as little better than disposable 
property -- and thus are immune to exhortations to use condoms and adopt other 
safe sex practices. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kenya, women are taught that when sex is not engaged in to conceive 
children, its purpose is to give pleasure to men, said Dorothy Onyango, a 
member of the International Community of Women Living With HIV and AIDS, a 
grass-roots network. 
</P>
<P>
 Although male promiscuity puts married women at risk, many Kenyan women are 
afraid to raise the subject of condom use for fear of embarrassing their 
husbands -- or, worse, sparking suspicion that they themselves are cheating. 
</P>
<P>
 "With husbands, it's unheard-of to use a condom," Onyango said. "He will beat 
you, thinking you have been with someone else." 
</P>
<P>
 "Disempowered people are vulnerable," said WHO's Merson. "(Consider) the 
untold numbers of women who fear infection from their partner, but do not have 
the power to insist on condom use or the economic power to leave the 
relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter how hard we try, traditional public health programs cannot make up 
for the negative impact of this difference in societal status and realization 
of rights," Mann said. "A group of women lawyers in Uganda has convinced me 
that the first step in fighting AIDS must be to rewrite the divorce and 
inheritance statutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The plight of women extends to their children, growing numbers of whom are 
being orphaned or born with HIV. WHO estimates that more than 5 million 
children under age 10 will lose their mothers to AIDS before the end of the 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the threat to children, one of the most exciting pieces of news at 
the conference, which ended last week, was the recently reported National 
Institutes of Health study showing that the anti-HIV drug AZT can reduce the 
transmission of the virus from infected mothers to children by two-thirds. 
</P>
<P>
 But Dr. James Balsley of NIH cautioned that the long-term effects of the 
therapy on the children have not been determined and that the success of the 
approach may drop as AZT-resistant strains of the virus become more common in 
the population.  
</P>
<P>
 "What we are saying today may not be true in several years," said Dr. Yvonne 
Bryson of UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the most important roadblock to widespread AZT use in developing 
countries is the cost of the drug ($3,500 per year for regular use) and need to 
infuse higher levels of it during childbirth. 
</P>
<P>
 "(In the future), we have to make these treatments affordable and feasible," 
Balsley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other, isolated bits of good news were scattered through the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Paul Volberding of UC San Francisco reported findings that seem to resolve 
some of the questions that have dogged use of AZT. The bottom line, he said, is 
that AZT prolongs life if given after an AIDS patient's CD4 count -- a measure 
of the health of the immune system -- has dropped below 500 cells per 
microliter of blood. Administering it earlier, he said, provides no additional 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other researchers reported encouraging results with new antiviral 
drugs, especially the second-generation versions of the so-called protease 
inhibitors. These drugs, which block an enzyme that is intimately linked to 
viral replication, are just now entering clinical trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a slow, evolutionary process," said Dr. Michael Saag of the 
University of Alabama at Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under the best scenario, three years from now we may be getting excited by a 
certain combination of drugs," he said. But he cautioned that it would be more 
like eight years before scientists knew for sure if they worked effectively. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Anthony Fauci of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases 
suggested that, in some cases, clinicians might be going in the wrong 
direction. While the focus of gene therapy, vaccines and other approaches is to 
bolster the patient's underactive immune system, he says part of the problem 
may be an overreaction of components of the immune system. If so, it might be 
more beneficial to suppress certain immune functions. 
</P>
<P>
 That approach was apparently supported by two papers presented by Dr. 
Jean-Marie Andrieu and his colleagues at the University of Paris. They reported 
that giving AIDS patients the immune-suppressing steroid Prednisolone in one 
study, and the anti-rejection drug cyclosporin A in a second, prevented 
progression of disease in small numbers of subjects. Twenty-seven patients who 
received cyclosporin showed no significant loss of CD4 cells during an average 
of 11 months of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Fauci applauded the results, but cautioned against a rush to use the drug. 
"There is a thin line between good and bad" immune suppression, he said, and it 
is not clear where that line is.  
</P>
<P>
 Researchers also drew hope from studies of so-called long-term survivors, 
people who have been infected by HIV for 10, 12 or even 15 years without 
developing full-blown AIDS. Such individuals represent less than 5% of the 
HIV-positive population. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David Ho of the Aaron Diamond AIDS Research Center in New York said there 
are at least two important factors in long-term survival. One is infection by a 
weaker strain of HIV -- what Ho termed "a wimpy virus." The second is an 
unusual capacity of the individual's CD8 cells, a form of white blood cell, to 
control replication of the virus in the body. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jay A. Levy of UC San Francisco said he is very close to isolating a 
protein from CD8 cells, called CD8 antiviral factor, which will hold the virus 
in check. Ho and other researchers said identification of this protein could be 
one of the most important developments in AIDS research to date. And in a move 
unusual in today's competitive research atmosphere, he called on funding 
agencies to give Levy more money. 
</P>
<P>
 Although some advances have been made in AIDS research, scientists are not yet 
close to a cure, according to Dr. Peter Piot, president of the International 
AIDS Society. He concluded: "Let us face the fact that AIDS is no longer an 
outbreak but has become endemic in many countries, and will be an integral part 
of the human condition for a very long time to come."

MEDIATORS SEEK KEY TO REOPEN BASEBALL TALKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As stadiums remained locked and empty on the second day of a strike by the 
major league baseball players, a team of federal mediators began searching 
Saturday for the key that will unlock the stalemated collective-bargaining 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Assn., 
and Richard Ravitch, the chief negotiator for the baseball team owners, met 
separately in their respective offices with three representatives of the 
Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service and a representative of the Labor 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Fehr and Ravitch refused to identify the mediators by name, and they were 
unavailable for comment later. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mediation can be a very valuable tool in solving disputes," Ravitch said, 
"but it's not a panacea. It can be helpful, but I don't want to create any 
unreal expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr concurred on that. He and Ravitch said they weren't certain when they 
will return to the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no feeling at this time that another meeting will be productive," 
Fehr said. "It appears things have settled in for awhile. The atmosphere 
reminds me more and more of 1981." 
</P>
<P>
 He referred to the 50-day strike in the middle of that baseball season. The 
dispute centered on compensation for the signing of free agents, and mediation 
failed to produce a quick settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners are now attempting to overhaul the compensation system and sell the 
union on a salary cap proposal that Fehr calls a "Rube Goldberg contraption" 
designed to deflate salaries by putting an artificial ceiling on the free 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the way of Western economies," Fehr said, "but it's not good enough for 
baseball. The mantra of this negotiation has been salary cap." 
</P>
<P>
 The sides remain polarized. The ideological differences run deep. The bottom 
line is that the union doesn't accept Ravitch's contention that the industry is 
in economic trouble or that the players should have to repay the bigger-market 
clubs for increased revenue sharing with the smaller-market teams by accepting 
a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we want to know is what it will cost to play ball," Ravitch said again 
Saturday. "We keep asking the players how much more they want, but we can't get 
an answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said his answer is that a free market should establish how much the 
players receive. He again said the owners are determined to break the union and 
have set the clock ticking toward unilateral implementation of their proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one party to the dispute begins with the premise that you have to shut 
the industry down, you can't expect much to happen until the clock reaches the 
appointed hour," Fehr said. "I don't know when that time will come, but the 
appointed hour is not here yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ravitch: "It's not the owners who are on strike. Thirty thousand people 
are out of work because a union whose members average $1.2 million in salary 
went on strike." 
</P>
<P>
 Into this debate comes a mediation team trying to defuse the rhetoric, help 
find common ground, keep the sides talking and facilitate a settlement with 
recommendations that aren't binding. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides conveyed their position and view of the dispute to the group on 
Saturday. It wasn't certain when the mediators will respond with their initial 
evaluation, but it's unlikely Fehr and Ravitch will negotiate again until then. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Orza, associate general counsel of the players' union, seemed to sum up 
the situation Saturday when he said of mediation: "Hopefully, it keeps the 
parties talking even though they are planets apart." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, 28 games have already been canceled and another 14 will be 
wiped out today, leaving it to minor league baseball to fill the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 The minors have drawn increased interest and attendance because of the strike. 
For example, Columbus drew 11,502 Friday night for its 6-2 loss to Richmond in 
the International League, up from its average attendance of 7,347.

NEWS ANALYSIS; AILING HEALTH REFORM COULD STAGE RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven months ago, when President Clinton stood before a joint session of 
Congress and unveiled his health care reform proposals to bipartisan applause, 
the effort to restructure the nation's health system looked like a marathon 
runner heading for the final mile. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the effort more closely resembles a patient on life support. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the patient's parlous condition does not rule out a recovery. 
Congressional veterans can reel off examples of weighty legislation, from 
deregulation of natural gas prices in the late 1970s to tax reform in the 
mid-1980s, that died a thousand deaths but rose in the end. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, particularly, Democratic leader George J. Mitchell of Maine 
appears to have stitched together a package that could, eventually, gain a 
majority. Republicans have so far blocked votes on any amendments to Mitchell's 
bill -- a sign, perhaps, that they believe that if test votes were held, 
Mitchell would win. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the House, which many oddsmakers had thought would have an easier time 
with health care reform, action has stalled, with no firm indication of when it 
might resume. 
</P>
<P>
 And even Mitchell's Senate bill faces high hurdles. Many key senators, while 
saying they could accept central parts of the measure, reject a proposed new 
tax on high-cost health plans designed to discourage excessive health spending 
and to generate revenue for subsidies to low- and middle-income working 
families. Others, including the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, have 
raised serious questions about whether key elements of Mitchell's plan, 
necessary as political compromises, would be unworkable in practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials and their allies argue that only large-scale reform 
will work -- that incremental changes in the health system are the equivalent 
of trying to jump halfway across a gorge. But those arguments run up against 
the natural tendency of Congress to seek a politically safe middle ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "You cannot control costs, you cannot reform the insurance industry unless you 
have universal coverage," said House Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman 
John D. Dingell (D-Mich.). But, Dingell conceded, incremental alternatives will 
be very attractive to "all the white mice and all the timid souls who want to 
rush through this thing and say we have voted for a compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, even if those problems can be surmounted, all reform efforts now face 
the awful pressure of the clock, which threatens to tick down before a bill can 
be enacted. 
</P>
<P>
 What went wrong? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, according to White House officials, members of Congress, lobbyists 
and congressional observers, is a host of factors: The inherent difficulty of 
the enterprise, Clinton's weaknesses as chief executive, declining voter 
anxiety about the economy, the increasingly partisan Republican response, 
deep-grained public skepticism about government, and White House missteps in 
the preparation and sale of the health plan all combined to reduce the 
prospects of any reform bill's passage. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest single problem might simply be the scale of the effort. Health 
care accounts for more than one-seventh of the U.S. economy, affects almost 
every interest group in the nation and touches the average family at the most 
personal level. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, Clinton has taken to noting that Franklin D. Roosevelt, Harry 
S. Truman, Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon all tried -- and failed -- to 
get major health care reform bills through Congress. Unstated, but implied, in 
such statements is the message that voters should not blame him too much if he 
also falls short. 
</P>
<P>
 Even some of Clinton's opponents accept that argument. "It's just a huge 
undertaking," said Rep. Jim Slattery (D-Kan.), whose opposition was one reason 
that the Energy and Commerce Committee failed in its effort to write a health 
care bill. "I don't know that you can say that somebody's strategy failed, or 
that somebody was the bad guy. . . . It's a bridge too far." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials like to compare health care reform with enactment of 
Social Security under Roosevelt and Medicare under Johnson. But "Medicare 
passed after the 1964 landslide against Barry Goldwater, and Social Security 
passed after one of the greatest crises in American history," noted Republican 
strategist William Kristol. 
</P>
<P>
 In trying to repeat such a feat without a major crisis to spur action, "there 
was a little bit of hubris here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in one of the ironies of the debate, Clinton's successes on economic 
policy might have undermined his case for health care reform. As the economy 
has improved, middle-class Americans have stopped worrying so much that they 
might soon lose their jobs, and thereby lose their health benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 That change might have made them less willing to support major restructuring 
of the health care system, although pollsters disagree about the strength of 
the link between the two issues. 
</P>
<P>
 What no analysts disagree about is that an undertaking as huge as reshaping 
the health care system has been made doubly difficult by the deep skepticism 
Americans feel toward government. 
</P>
<P>
 For many lawmakers, those doubts have been symbolized by a story, often 
repeated on Capitol Hill, about a member of Congress who was accosted by an 
angry constituent who said he opposed the health bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want the government messing around in Medicare," the constituent 
said, apparently unaware, or unwilling to concede, that the giant medical 
program for the elderly is a wholly government-run enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 So long as Clinton talked about the problems facing the health care system, a 
majority of Americans agreed with him. But as soon as he, or anyone else, began 
outlining proposed solutions, doubts began to overwhelm the proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you look at our society in general, there are so many splintered voices of 
authority, and there is so much skepticism, even cynicism, about the political 
process," said First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton. Because of that skepticism, 
she said, "huge amounts of money spent to convey an intense, negative message 
has a very powerful impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those inherent problems, many say they believe that the Administration 
could have handled its case better. 
</P>
<P>
 The first stage of the process, the lengthy study by an Administration task 
force run by Hillary Clinton and White House policy adviser Ira Magaziner, 
comes in for almost universal criticism inside and outside the Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The task force worked in secrecy, allowing opponents to plant the idea that 
its participants were up to no good. While the First Lady and others held 
extensive talks with members of Congress, including Republicans, the failure to 
include any in the task force lost what could have been a key opportunity to 
co-opt potential opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the length of the task force process, when the President finally 
presented his plan in a nationally televised speech last September, the White 
House was still unprepared. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials had talked of having booklets and other explanatory material ready 
to send across the country in order to make the case to voters following the 
President's speech. Instead, they had nothing. At a time when Americans were 
deeply curious about exactly what Clinton was suggesting, opponents were able 
to fill an information vacuum with their own derogatory descriptions of the 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics argue that the President and his aides made a crucial error by 
insisting on providing health coverage to everyone instead of starting with a 
less-sweeping package, then compounded the error this past winter when Clinton 
vowed during his State of the Union speech to veto any bill that did not 
include universal coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were attached to madness. They were attached to scientific 
impossibility," complained one senior congressional aide. "If they would have 
gone to 95% (coverage) in March, they could have had (Senate Republican leader) 
Bob Dole. We'd be in a legislating mode now, rather than a frenzy. They've 
missed every single turn in the road in timing." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials angrily deny that. "I thought the veto threat was a good 
idea then. I still think it was a good idea," said one senior official. "It 
shows people what we are fighting for. People know where (Clinton) stands." 
</P>
<P>
 The real problem, according to this official and others in the White House, is 
that Clinton's political weakness on issues other than health care caused 
Republicans earlier this year to abandon conciliation and move to an all-out 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, for example, 20 Republican senators, including Dole, co-sponsored a 
bill that promised to achieve universal coverage through a requirement that all 
individuals buy insurance. Dole publicly said he thought the country faced a 
health care "crisis" and sharply criticized Kristol for urging Congress to 
reject Clinton's plans outright. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, all 20 of those Republicans have disavowed their original plan, Dole 
has abandoned talk of a crisis, and talk of compromise has faded away. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they sensed a political opening, their support for health care melted 
away," the senior White House official said. "This had a lot to do with events 
outside of health care," referring to such problems as Whitewater, the 
sexual-harassment suit filed against Clinton by Paula Corbin Jones and the 
Administration's reversals on foreign policy matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, even Republican strategists such as Kristol agree that in late winter 
and early spring, GOP opposition to health care reform began to harden. 
Lawmakers who earlier talked of compromise began to speak more openly of 
killing Clinton's bill outright. 
</P>
<P>
 The increasingly fierce nature of the opposition compounded a pre-existing 
problem: Clinton's potential allies in the health care reform fight proved far 
more timid than his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration strategists knew that many small businesses would reject any 
plan with the so-called employer mandate requiring companies to purchase 
insurance for their workers, but they hoped to gain significant support from 
big businesses that already provide coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, while some businesses, such as automobile and steel companies, have 
lobbied for Clinton's plan, most large companies have stayed on the sidelines, 
in part because top executives, most of whom are Republicans and conservative, 
decided they were uncomfortable pushing for a liberal Democratic initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Chamber of Commerce started out in favor of the employer mandate. But 
in February, its board retracted that support. Within days, two other business 
groups -- the National Assn. of Manufacturers and the Business Roundtable -- 
joined in the rejection of Clinton-style plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the American Medical Assn. endorsed universal coverage and the 
employer mandate two years ago, but backed off last December. In July, the AMA 
shifted position again, joining the AFL-CIO and the American Assn. of Retired 
Persons to again call for universal coverage. This past week, the doctors 
flipped a third time, saying they would support an incremental reform bill 
proposed by conservatives in the House, rather than the universal coverage 
bills backed by the Democratic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some groups that had much to gain from comprehensive health care 
reform remained eerily silent. Some hoped to gain greater bargaining leverage, 
others were unsure what to do. 
</P>
<P>
 The most notable was the AARP, whose 33 million members would have benefited 
from Clinton's proposals to expand coverage for long-term care and outpatient 
prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 The AARP's leadership resisted repeated personal overtures from the President 
to support his plan. Instead, like other groups that were generally in favor of 
the Clinton approach, the AARP talked up long-term care and drug coverage 
without mentioning Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 This became a pattern throughout the past 18 months. "People who opposed 
reform attacked the Clinton plan by name. But supporters just talked up the 
elements," said one lobbyist. Only this past week did the AARP leadership 
explicitly endorse the Democratic bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who opposed Clinton from the outset have been not at all reticent. The 
Health Insurance Assn. of America represents small- and mid-sized insurance 
firms, many of which faced bankruptcy under a Clinton-type reform plan. The 
HIAA launched the highly successful "Harry and Louise" ad campaign that raised 
doubts about the President's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition came even though HIAA shared many of Clinton's other goals, 
such as the employer mandate and universal coverage. Earlier this year, HIAA 
President Willis D. Gradison Jr. met with White House officials Harold M. Ickes 
and George Stephanopoulos and, during the course of a long conversation, 
suggested that an effective advertising campaign could be made to promote their 
common goals. In the end, those talks came to naught. 
</P>
<P>
 The combination of hesitant support from friends and unstinting opposition 
from foes has left many senior legislators and Administration officials 
exhausted and dispirited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ultimately, a lot of us, a lot of groups, have to sublimate their concerns to 
some extent in order to get the group, the society, to be able to step forward 
and to change things for the better," said House Majority Leader Richard A. 
Gephardt (D-Mo.). "If everyone is just going to focus in on their narrow 
viewpoint on a particular issue, we're never going to get to the consensus that 
we've got to have in this society to move forward." 
</P>
<P>
 And after months of fighting, some in the Administration have begun, at times, 
talking in the language of post-mortems. 
</P>
<P>
 "You win some and you lose some, but at least you kind of pushed the ball and 
you keep moving the public debate," Hillary Clinton said in a recent interview. 
"So I think this is a political issue that is not going to go away, no matter 
what happens."

WON'T GIVE UP GUN BAN, CLINTON SAYS; LEGISLATION: PRESIDENT REJECTS ANY 
COMPROMISE, EVEN AS DISCORD GROWS OVER HIS STALLED CRIME BILL. DEMOCRATS ARE 
DIVIDED; A SEPARATE VOTE ON THE ASSAULT WEAPONS PROVISION IS BEING DISCUSSED.

<P>
 President Clinton declared Saturday that he will not deal away a proposed ban 
on assault weapons in order to secure passage of his sidetracked crime bill, 
despite efforts by his aides to find middle ground with lawmakers who oppose 
the ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let me be clear about this," Clinton said during his weekly radio address. 
"The crime bill must ban assault weapons that have no place on our streets." 
</P>
<P>
 The President's remarks appeared to be aimed at House Democrats, who are 
openly divided over how to advance the crime bill after Thursday's crushing 
decision against sending the $33-billion package to the House floor for debate 
and a vote. 
</P>
<P>
 As White House aides and House leaders have strategized over their next move, 
some Democrats have urged that the bill be sent back intact for a second vote. 
</P>
<P>
 But others have wondered aloud whether the better approach would be backing 
off the provision banning 19 semiautomatic assault weapons to get support from 
lawmakers who point to the gun-control provision as the reason for withholding 
their vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill calls for hiring 100,000 additional police officers, building new 
prisons and jails and expanding federal crime-prevention programs. The 
legislation also would require life imprisonment for repeat offenders of 
federal crimes and would expand the number of federal crimes subject to the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 An assortment of legislators joined forces Thursday night in a 225-210 
procedural vote that blocked the legislation from reaching the House floor. 
Democratic leaders are trying to win over at least eight opponents so they can 
call another vote on the measure early this week. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill stalled in part because Republicans objected to funding for social 
programs, while a coalition of liberal and black Democrats balked at the death 
penalty measures. The concerns about assault weapons crossed party lines. 
Supported by the National Rifle Assn., House Republicans and some Democrats -- 
notably those from Southern states -- are reluctant to back any bill that 
restricts gun ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can have a crime bill, but the question is what happens to the 
assault-weapons ban," said Rep. Bill Richardson of New Mexico, the Democrats' 
chief deputy whip, as lawmakers scrambled to figure out how to salvage the 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, sounding more forceful on the assault-weapons ban than in the past, 
struck a defiant note, saying the ban is non-negotiable. He urged the public to 
express its outrage to lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The American people have to make it clear to members of Congress from both 
parties that even if they disagree with a particular measure in this crime 
bill, the overall bill is the best, the smartest bill we have ever had in this 
country," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's comments, broadcast from the Camp David, Md., presidential retreat, 
was part of a coordinated Administration effort to increase political pressure 
on lawmakers who voted against the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 In the GOP response to the radio address, Sen. Charles E. Grassley of Iowa 
complained that the crime bill had been "gutted behind closed doors." He said 
its toughest provisions had been replaced with "pork-barrel projects and 
spending for dance classes, midnight basketball and arts and crafts." 
</P>
<P>
 "While the President supported this watered-down bill, it wasn't tough enough 
for the American people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta and Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno emerged from a closed-door meeting with a group of law enforcement 
officials to dramatize the Administration's solidarity with police -- and to 
focus public anger on any House member who votes a second time to block passage 
of the crime bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those who voted the wrong way on this bill are catching a lot of hell back 
home," Panetta said. "And, very frankly, the purpose of this fight is to make 
sure that they think twice about what their vote's going to be the next time 
this bill comes back." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the scenes, however, Panetta was looking for a way to separate the 
assault-weapons provision from the entire crime bill, said Senate Minority 
Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.). 
</P>
<P>
 At a news conference following a meeting with Senate Democratic leaders, Dole 
said Panetta brought up the possibility of allowing a separate vote on the ban 
during a conversation early Saturday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 House Minority Whip Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who stood beside Dole during the 
news conference, welcomed the idea of casting a separate vote on the 
assault-weapons ban. "We think there should be a free-standing vote on its 
merits," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A White House spokesman, however, said Panetta was not the person who broached 
the subject of voting separately on the assault-weapons provision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dole made the first offer" to call a separate vote, the spokesman said. He 
added that Panetta called Dole and Gingrich to open lines of communication on 
the crime bill, but "made no offers and struck no deals" concerning the 
assault-weapons ban. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is only one signal coming out of the White House -- the one that the 
President said in his radio address," the spokesman said. "We think the assault 
ban should be a part of the crime bill."

COLUMN ONE; A DOSE OF REALITY HITS CEDARS; ONE OF THE NATION'S PREMIER 
HOSPITALS STRUGGLES TO REINVENT ITSELF IN AN ERA OF MANAGED CARE. SHIFT IN 
PRIORITIES SPARKS REFORMS, BUT ALSO INTERNAL STRIFE.

<P>
 Money once was rarely a problem for Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, the 
prestigious Westside hospital that has catered to Saudi princesses, Hollywood 
stars and the city's affluent. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying on its reputation for first-rate care, the largest private hospital in 
the West could charge top dollar and count on insurers to pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 When it wanted a new building or a new wing, Cedars could call upon Southern 
California's rich and powerful -- names such as Spielberg and Sinatra -- to 
help raise millions. 
</P>
<P>
 But today, Cedars -- a half-billion-dollar-a-year business -- is barely 
profitable. About a quarter of its 850 private rooms are empty on average. It 
has laid off hundreds of workers, shut down some patient wings and cut 
programs. An ambitious plan to expand the hospital by 50% has been put on hold, 
seen as outdated and too costly. 
</P>
<P>
 The problems are largely a consequence of the managed health care revolution 
taking place even before President Clinton and Congress strike a deal on 
national health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedars' efforts to respond to the changes have met with great resistance from 
many among its 2,300 physicians -- a cleavage that some doctors liken to a 
civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital and a key group of doctors have squared off in a bitter lawsuit. 
Doctors spurned the hospital's recommendation for a new chief of staff. And 
hundreds of worried physicians have joined various groups that eventually could 
redirect patients to rival hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the nation, insurers -- at the urging of employers, who pay most 
medical bills -- are taking dramatic steps to rein in medical spending. Health 
maintenance organizations and other managed-care firms are sharply reducing the 
time people stay in hospitals -- or averting hospital stays altogether by 
sending people to outpatient clinics, where surgery can be performed as safely 
and more cheaply. From hospitals and doctors, they are demanding deep 
discounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes are striking hardest at elite teaching hospitals such as Cedars, a 
training site for the UCLA School of Medicine. Although the teaching and 
research such hospitals perform make them valuable to the community, they also 
render them expensive and inefficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with shrinking revenues, such hospitals must find a way to respond to 
market pressures while maintaining the quality care that draws patients and 
assures their prestige. Cedars, one top doctor there has warned, faces the kind 
of calamity that has rocked hidebound IBM and General Motors if it fails to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 So Cedars is struggling, painfully, to do nothing less than reinvent itself. 
"The transition period is very turbulent, very tough, because you're giving up 
old ways of thinking," said Thomas Priselac, Cedars' chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The marketplace, said Berkeley health care consultant Peter Boland, "is 
forcing tremendous consolidation and the largest hospitals in metropolitan 
areas will have to radically downsize and refocus. Academic health centers are 
not immune. There's going to be a lot of bloodshed before this is settled." 
</P>
<P>
 More is at stake than Cedars' institutional pride in being a world-class 
facility. Some doctors fear that managed care may jeopardize the hospital's 
standards. But hospital officials insist that quality will not be sacrificed -- 
and may improve -- as the changes unfold. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. John Block, president of The Johns Hopkins Hospital, worries that the 
spread of managed care will result in teaching hospitals losing their medical 
edge. "Hospitals like Cedars or Johns Hopkins that have a sophisticated 
capacity to deal with the very sick will be functioning in a system where 
everyone involved will have a profound economic incentive not to use them, and 
that's just not good for health care," Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns Hopkins is among dozens of elite teaching hospitals -- including UCLA 
School of Medicine, Stanford Medical Center and Massachusetts General Hospital 
-- wrestling with similar concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Mass General stunned Boston's medical community this year by agreeing to merge 
with longtime rival Brigham and Women's Hospital to create the nation's biggest 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The steps proposed by Cedars' management are less dramatic. They want the 
hospital to slim down. But more important, they say, Cedars must be reorganized 
to increase its clout in the managed-care environment. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most teaching facilities, the hospital -- which sprawls over eight city 
blocks -- has a large staff top-heavy with well-paid specialists, lots of 
costly, high-tech equipment and a sluggish bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cedars has not been one of the most cost-effective hospitals," said the chief 
executive of a major Southern California health maintenance organization who 
asked not to be identified. "They've catered to attracting high-quality 
specialists and told them: 'We'll do whatever you want. You can have any 
equipment, any service, any nursing ratio you want.' Given that dynamic, it's 
hard to manage your costs effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past year, Cedars has slashed $50 million from its $570-million budget, 
reduced its staff by 700, to 6,500 employees, and closed two patient wings. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedars' board of directors has considered -- but rejected -- other efficiency 
measures, including a significant reduction in its teaching and research 
activities. Such a move would likely be highly unpopular with the hospital's 
powerful physician-researchers, doctors say. Described by one industry 
consultant as a "loss leader" for Cedars, some experts say the hospital's 
teaching and research efforts hamper its ability to compete in a managed-care 
era. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond cutting costs, Cedars is also trying to form closer alliances with its 
doctors and with other health care providers -- including hospitals and HMOs. 
It wants to create a "physician-hospital organization" whose main purpose would 
be capturing managed-care contracts. The complicated plan would make the 
hospitals and doctors equal partners -- a much closer relationship than in the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also mean they would share more of the financial risk of providing 
care, which insurers increasingly are passing on to providers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedars also wants to expand its outpatient facilities and branch out into 
in-home and long-term care. 
</P>
<P>
 "The driving forces for what we are doing are the same things that are 
affecting the entire industry -- principally the pressure to provide as high a 
quality service as you can at the lowest possible cost," said Priselac, a 
15-year veteran of Cedars who was promoted to the top job in January after the 
resignation of Sheldon King, now an executive with Salick Health Care, a Los 
Angeles-based operator of cancer treatment centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Personable and pragmatic, Priselac, who at 43 is one of the youngest 
executives running a major U.S. hospital, will try to steer Cedars through one 
of its most turbulent periods in a job he said is "as difficult as anything 
I've had to deal with in 20 years." 
</P>
<P>
 One of Priselac's more delicate tasks: prepping the hospital for managed care 
while preserving the upscale image that has enabled Cedars to attract 
substantial support from the city's glitterati. While uniformed valets park 
patients' cars, management exhorts doctors on the staff to become "more like 
Kaiser," the pioneering HMO that has thrived with no-frills, quality care. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a tricky balance. Few hospitals enjoy the kind of community support that 
Cedars does. Its "Campaign for the 21st Century" fund has collected more than 
$70 million in donations in two years. The support is also evident in the 
hospital's collection of (donated) art, which includes works by Picasso, 
Lichtenstein and Hockney. Cedars says the 8,000 pieces represent the largest 
private collection of modern art that is not in a museum. A Robert Rauschenberg 
lithograph hangs just outside the coffee shop. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedars' gilded image has, over the years, been carefully polished by its 
marketing staff. Ron Wise, the lanky vice president and chief publicist, has 
Kirk Douglas in his Rolodex; the actor and his wife, Anne Davis, are honorary 
chairs of Cedars' fund-raising drive. 
</P>
<P>
 Wise appears frequently in the media, giving health updates on celebrities 
admitted to Cedars -- he was called to the hospital at 5 a.m. Thursday to 
handle media calls regarding O.J. Simpson's surgery. Sometimes he announces 
celebrity deaths. Lucille Ball, Danny Thomas, Sammy Cahn and River Phoenix are 
among those who spent their last hours at the hospital. (Though Cedars does 
attract a healthy share of well-heeled clients to its hotel-like, eighth-floor 
VIP rooms, most of its patients are ordinary folks. The hospital also spent 
$14.2 million last year in providing uncompensated care for patients who lacked 
insurance.) 
</P>
<P>
 Cedars can also boast of solid medical achievements. It consistently ranks 
high among the top hospitals in U.S. News & World Report's annual surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 In the most recent ranking of hospitals that deliver sophisticated care to the 
sickest patients, Cedars placed among the top in three of 16 medical 
specialties, down from six in 1993. UCLA School of Medicine, with which Cedars 
shares training of UCLA medical students, was among the magazine's "Best of the 
Best," achieving high rankings in 12 specialties. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Cedars doctors were the first to use a pig's liver to sustain a woman 
while a human organ was found. Unfortunately, the patient died during the wait, 
but the technique helped lead to a so-called "bio-artificial" liver, which 
includes pig cells and fibers that mimic a human liver. Cedars' efforts gave 
doctors techniques to use while they wait for human organs. 
</P>
<P>
 The excimer laser, now used worldwide for non-invasive surgical procedures, 
was pioneered by Cedars doctors in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedars' efforts to trim costs without shortchanging quality can be seen in 7 
Northeast, the seventh-floor orthopedic wing. Here the hospital is testing 
"patient-focused care," a concept catching on at such prestigious medical 
facilities as Yale-New Haven Hospital and Stanford Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Geraldine Popolow, a vice president in charge of patient care, said a Cedars 
study showed that a cardiac patient may see as many as 105 hospital workers 
during a weeklong stay. That's not only inefficient, but can be disconcerting 
to patients who see a string of unfamiliar faces passing through their rooms to 
deliver food or transport them to the radiology lab. The hospital wants to 
slash the figure to about 40 workers. 
</P>
<P>
 So Cedars is cross-training its nurses, clinical technicians and other support 
staff to handle more tasks and it is forming teams to care for small groups of 
patients. Desktop computers are placed outside each "quad" of four hospital 
rooms, allowing nurses to look up medical records without walking to the main 
nursing station. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person who draws your blood can also take your cardiogram, make your bed 
or bring you a glass of water," Popolow said. "It's not appropriate for anyone 
to say, 'This is not my job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which Cedars wants to expand hospital-wide, should cut costs 
about 5%, officials said. Another cost-reduction move: The hospital got its 
orthopedic surgeons to agree on a single company to supply prosthetic devices 
such as artificial hips, saving $400,000 last year. 
</P>
<P>
 For Cedars management, getting that agreement was easy compared to selling 
more fundamental changes to its reluctant doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 Managed care is bitter medicine for many doctors -- particularly specialists 
already facing sharp drops in income. Many see it as a threat to the level of 
care they are accustomed to providing their patients, to their autonomy and to 
their financial survival. 
</P>
<P>
 The intensity of the internal debate was evident when hundreds of physicians 
gathered in December at the Wilshire Ebell Theater to discuss the hospital's 
plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of Cedars' proposed physician-hospital organization argued that the 
hospital must get its act together or lose patients to more efficient 
competitors like Kaiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this (physician-hospital organization)functioning well," one of the 
doctors said in support of the plan, "the hospital is dead." Many other doctors 
remained unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan has stirred tensions dating back to Cedars' first foray into managed 
care. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the hospital backed the formation of a medical group known as the 
Cedars-Sinai Physicians Assn. The hospital wanted to place thousands of 
hospital employees in a lower-cost HMO plan that would utilize Cedars doctors. 
The group initially was managed by the hospital and relegated to a tiny 
basement office. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Cedars physicians detested the idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looked at as radicals, as people who were going to destroy medicine," 
recalled Dr. Seymour Levine, a founder of the group. At the time, he said, many 
doctors figured that a prestigious place such as Cedars need not be concerned 
about the managed care movement that was gaining momentum in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Some physicians who joined got blunt warnings from colleagues: Quit the group 
or you'll get no more patient referrals. 
</P>
<P>
 After a few years, the medical group, unhappy with Cedars' handling of its 
affairs, essentially fired the hospital as its manager. In 1992, the hospital 
sued the medical group it had created, naming Levine as a defendant. The 
physician group later countersued. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit is pending, though some issues have been resolved. The hospital 
got Levine's group to drop "Cedars-Sinai" from its name; it recently was 
renamed Health Source Medical Group. But the hospital lost something as well. 
Health Source, which oversees care for 65,000 HMO members -- a large block of 
patients the hospital doesn't want to lose -- no longer admits its members 
exclusively to Cedars. It is sending more patients to other Westside hospitals, 
including Midway Hospital about a mile from Cedars, where costs are lower. 
</P>
<P>
 Priselac calls the suit "sadly unavoidable"; both sides say they are trying to 
resolve their dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 That the bitterness lingers was evident this year when Cedars' medical staff 
broke a two-decade precedent by refusing to reelect Dr. Burton Fink -- the 
hospital's recommended candidate -- as chief of staff. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital refused for several weeks to disclose the results of the election 
to either the staff or Dr. Stephen J. Uman, the internist who defeated Fink. 
Uman has encouraged doctors to accept the inevitability of managed care. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter whether this change is 'fair' or in the best interest of 
our patients (and these issues are debatable)," Uman wrote in a letter to 
doctors in April. "To ignore the change coming will place you in the position 
of IBM or General Motors, which ignored changes in their businesses and 
suffered as a consequence." 
</P>
<P>
 While 750 doctors have sought membership in Cedars' new physician-hospital 
organization, other Cedars doctors -- many of them unhappy with the hospital's 
plan -- have formed rival medical groups that may compete with Cedars for 
managed care contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. William Young has organized the 65 African American doctors on Cedars' 
staff into a group called the Physician Integrated Health Network, saying that 
black doctors have little voice in the hospital's leadership. Noting that about 
22% of patients admitted to Cedars are African Americans, he said: "Clearly we 
are not represented (in similar numbers) on the physician staff or in the 
administrative structure of the hospital." 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of unity among Cedars doctors could prove a detriment to the 
hospital, said Dr. Barry Rosenbloom, a leader of the new physician-hospital 
group. "With the doctors being split, the insurers or employers could use one 
faction against the other to negotiate lower rates," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've sent out the olive branch to all of the groups," Rosenbloom said, "but 
people are still wary." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Leon Bender, a urologist and former chief of staff at Cedars, is among the 
skeptical doctors. He does not accept HMO contracts now, but figures that soon 
he will not be able to turn away such business. 
</P>
<P>
 "The patients are directing us to act," he said. "I can't shut my eyes to the 
market forces out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Ronald Bronow, meanwhile, stands steadfast against managed care. HMOs, 
Bronow said, are "revolving-door medicine that tries to get the patients out 
the door as quickly as possible. The whole idea to me is completely revolting." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cedars officials dispute such claims. 
</P>
<P>
 Irving Feintech, chairman of Cedars' board of directors, said in a statement 
that the hospital "will not, now, or ever, compromise on quality." 
</P>
<P>
 And Priselac said: "Just as we set the gold standard in many respects . . . 
under the old system, we are setting out to make sure the public knows they can 
get Cedars-Sinai level of quality care in a managed-care environment." 
BACKGROUND 
</P>
<P>
 Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, a nonprofit, nondenominational private hospital, 
was formed in 1961 through the merger of Cedars of Lebanon Hospital and Mt. 
Sinai Hospital. Cedars of Lebanon was founded as Kaspare Cohn Hospital in 1902, 
an eight-bed home for Jewish tubercular patients. Mt. Sinai was founded in 1921 
as a six-bed facility for needy patients during an influenza epidemic. In 1976, 
after completion of a $100-million addition, Cedars-Sinai consolidated its 
operations at a single, 1,120-bed hospital on Beverly Boulevard. Wrenching 
Changes for Cedars-Sinai 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last decade, the annual number of patients admitted to Cedars-Sinai 
has been fairly stable. But cost-cutting pressures from HMOs and other managed 
care firms -- as well as new medical technology and drug treatments -- have

POST-QUAKE CONTRACTOR FRAUD WIDENS; AFTERMATH: RISE SEEN IN NUMBER OF 
UNLICENSED REPAIRMEN SOLICITING OR PERFORMING WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Standing in her garage, beneath a twisted and splintered beam that supports 
the second floor of her Tarzana house, Linda Rubenstein was appalled both at 
her own mistakes and at the gall of the man who passed himself off as a 
licensed contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe I paid him $25,000," she said, pointing out the sloppy repair 
work. "He just conned me left and right. What can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
 After paying thousands to the man, who actually did not have a license, 
Rubenstein must now pay another contractor $20,000 to have much of the work 
redone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't afford it," she said. "I don't have the money. I live on Social 
Security." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities fear that more and more quake victims will end up like Linda 
Rubenstein. Although instances of contractor fraud surfaced just weeks after 
the Jan. 17 earthquake, the problem is beginning to grow now that homeowners 
are securing government aid or private loans for repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been saying all along the real fraud would not be known for several 
months and there may be some indication that that time is nigh," said Deputy 
Dist. Atty. John Luder, a member of the district attorney's consumer protection 
division. "Everything is coming to the surface now. It's countywide. Any place 
where there was damage, you can expect that." Since the quake, the number of 
complaints received at the Van Nuys office of the Contractor State License 
Board -- which covers the San Fernando, Santa Clarita and Antelope valleys -- 
has skyrocketed to 275 a month, three times the normal average, said Sam 
Haynes, spokesman for the license board. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a lot of people needing (home) repairs, and they have FEMA money or 
insurance money," said Mary Ellen Martinet of Bet Tzedek Legal Aide Society. 
"We have possibly a whole new group of people who are going to be vulnerable to 
this home equity fraud and home contractor fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 In a series of undercover stings and sweeps through heavily damaged 
neighborhoods held in the months since the quake, investigators with the 
Contractor State License Board uncovered at least 80 unlicensed contractors 
soliciting or engaged in repair work, Haynes said. 
</P>
<P>
 And last week, West Valley police reported a rash of cases involving repairmen 
who were believed to be unlicensed. At least 30 homeowners called to report 
that they were approached by workmen who offered to repair cement block walls 
and driveways at cut-rate prices. Some homeowners lost thousands of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys do a little work, ask for money for materials, and off they go never 
to be seen again," said Sgt. Frank Mezquita. "People think they're getting a 
good deal, and the next thing you know they're getting ripped off."  
</P>
<P>
 But the loss is more than financial. 
</P>
<P>
 The time that homeowners could have spent on quake repairs has instead been 
spent in meetings with attorneys and in calls to police and other law 
enforcement officials to report or track down unscrupulous contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 The staircases leading to 85-year-old Charles Syracuse's coach at the Blue 
Star Mobile Home Park in Sylmar are held in place with bricks that he has 
carefully placed underneath the base. And he is still cautious when he walks on 
the carpeted floor inside the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still picking up glass," Syracuse said, standing in the living room of 
his coach. "I don't dare walk around barefoot." 
</P>
<P>
 During the quake, Syracuse's coach tilted, and six steel rods that held the 
two staircases in place collapsed. Glasses and other knickknacks crashed to the 
floor. With money fromFEMA, Syracuse thought he would be able to make all the 
needed repairs, but now that money is gone and his stairs are not repaired, the 
carpet has not been replaced and other repairs are still undone. 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse signed a contract and gave another man, who said he was supervisor of 
the project, three checks totaling more than $6,000 to make the repairs. The 
workers hoisted the coach and placed jacks underneath, and performed smaller 
jobs inside the coach. But before the job was completed, the workers suddenly 
stopped showing up. They had not been paid by the general contractor, they told 
Syracuse, and they would not return until they had been paid. 
</P>
<P>
 After repeated phone calls, Syracuse finally reached the supervisor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I will get in touch with you,' and I haven't heard from him since," 
Syracuse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Syracuse estimates that he lost about $3,000 in the deal, but because he 
failed to get a copy of the contract, even that is only an estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys with Bet Tzedek are now attempting to track down the contractor who, 
they said, was not licensed and had presented Syracuse another contractor's 
license number. 
</P>
<P>
 "I assumed they were honest," Syracuse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those kinds of assumptions, authorities say, can be dangerous. Finding a 
contractor is a serious task, and homeowners must take time to educate 
themselves about the hazards and pitfalls of home repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to be prepared to deal with contractors and it takes some 
homework," said Larry Chafe, assistant regional director with the State 
Contractor License Board. 
</P>
<P>
 As FEMA checks and insurance money roll in, now is the time when that 
education is especially needed. Disasters have a way of attracting people from 
all over the country, who come hoping to cash in on whatever money is flowing 
because of the calamity. Of the unlicensed contractors arrested in sweeps, some 
have come from Nevada, Texas and Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have learned that there are disaster-chasers who will go from the Miami 
hurricanes to the floods in the Midwest to fires and earthquakes in 
California," Haynes said. "There seem to be people who indeed go where the 
misery is and try to take advantage of people." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if a person is licensed in another state, that license is not valid in 
California. And it is illegal for anybody to contract without a license for 
work that is worth $300 or more. Such work in an official disaster area can be 
a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Granted, some disputes with contractors can arise from miscommunications by 
the homeowner, the contractor or both. But, said Chafe of the state licensing 
board, "anytime homeowners have a dispute with a contractor where there's a 
question if the contractor acted lawfully, they should file a complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 But even before the work begins, the homeowner should check out the 
contractor. In Linda Rubenstein's case, she checked her contractor's 
credentials with the state after the work was completed. She learned that the 
license he gave her actually belonged to another contractor. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she says, he has refused to respond to her and her son's requests for a 
settlement. They have spent much time and effort calling city and state 
agencies hoping to find a way to get at least part of the money back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I've come out a loser, but I can't let him get away with everything," 
she said. "That's holding up my house, that beam. . . . God forbid we have 
another earthquake. It could all collapse." Checking Out a Contractor 
</P>
<P>
 There are some measures homeowners can take to avoid problems with 
contractors, according to the Contractor State License Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners should always get at least three bids on any job. To ensure that 
the contractor is licensed, the homeowner should ask for a license number and 
to see the contractor's pocket license, a plastic card the size of a credit 
card with the contractor's name and license number on it. This card is issued 
by the CSLB and carries the logo of the Department of Consumer Affairs. It has 
a magnetic strip on the back, said Sam Haynes, spokesman for the CSLB. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not uncommon for unlicensed contractors to give false license numbers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen them use their driver's license number or somebody else's number," 
Haynes said. "I've seen one guy use his phone number in reverse." 
</P>
<P>
 A contractor's licenses is like a driver's license, Haynes said. It is not 
transferable and can only be used by the person it is assigned to or a partner 
listed with the CSLB. 
</P>
<P>
 Homeowners should call the Contractor State License Board, not only to 
determine if the license is valid, but to determine if the person has ever been 
cited or if there are any actions pending. 
</P>
<P>
 The board can also tell if the contractor has workers' compensation for 
employees. Without workers' compensation, a homeowner may be liable for any 
injuries to the contractor or his workers while they are on the homeowner's 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 To check on a license number, call: 800 321-CSLB. 
</P>
<P>
 To obtain the CSLB booklet "What You Should Know About Hiring a Contractor" or 
to file a complaint, homeowners may call the district offices of the CSLB:

HELPING CONSERVATION TAKE ROOT IN RAIN FOREST; BIOLOGY: VISITING BRAZILIAN 
HOPES TO SET UP VOLUNTEER AND PUBLIC EDUCATION PROGRAMS IN JUNGLE SIMILAR TO 
THOSE SHE WITNESSED ON CHANNEL ISLANDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The often dry and wind-swept landscapes of the Channel Islands seem an 
unlikely training ground for a woman charged with protecting the lush rain 
forests of eastern Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 But through an exchange program hosted by wildlife biologists in Ventura, 
Maria Elisa Castellanos Sola will take home valuable tips to help her manage 
the endangered and disappearing jungles in the state of Minas Gerais. 
</P>
<P>
 Sola, who is nicknamed Sandy, is at once excited and intensely serious as she 
talks about her plans to set up volunteer and public education programs like 
the ones she saw here. 
</P>
<P>
 On Santa Cruz Island, she saw high school students working as volunteers in a 
summer program with the Nature Conservancy to repair fences, rid the island of 
non-native plants and do general maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 Each evening, the groups of students prepared a short presentation on the work 
they did that day, and the issues it involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "While these children are doing this hard work, they are also learning about 
the environment," Sola said. "When you have kids working with preservation, you 
teach them something they could not learn in a classroom. It was really 
beautiful to see this." 
</P>
<P>
 That combination of teaching and tapping the potentially vast network of free 
energy through volunteers will turn into a similar program in Brazil, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is my plan to have a program like this, this year," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sola is one of two scientists from Latin America chosen to come to Ventura 
County this year as part of a program aimed at exchanging information and 
experiences, learning from North American mistakes and profiting from 
successes. 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-week course was conceived by Marc Weitzel, a Ventura-based U.S. Fish 
and Wildlife Service biologist who counts leading the California condor 
recovery team among his duties. The program is funded by Fish and Wildlife's 
Office of International Affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, the 2-year-old program will send U.S. scientists to Latin America 
to learn from that region's experience as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to think of protecting natural resources in a global context," 
Weitzel said. The air and water that are cleansed and purified by the rain 
forests of Brazil are important to the entire region, he said. "One could look 
at the entire Western Hemisphere as a single ecosystem." 
</P>
<P>
 Migratory birds, which spend many months of the year in Ventura County, spend 
their winters in Central and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 "Natural resources do not respect political boundaries," he said. To protect 
endangered species in California, their habitats in Latin America must also be 
preserved, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Ventura County, Sola visited the Hopper Mountain Wildlife Refuge, where 
biologists lived during the first months that the endangered California condors 
were reintroduced to the wild in the nearby Sespe Condor Sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 She also spent a few days with the Channel Islands National Marine Sanctuary 
staff, visiting Santa Cruz Island. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she found some similarities in the problems involving ranching on the 
Channel Islands and in Brazil. In both places, introducing animals that are 
domestically bred for human consumption damages the environment. 
</P>
<P>
 On the islands, the animals destroy native grasses and shrubs with grazing and 
in Brazil the ranchers cut down the forest to make way for pastures for grazing 
or, in some areas, coal mining. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmers there are on contract with large companies that own the land, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are very poor people who go inside the forest to cut for the industry," 
she said. "They do not know what they are allowed to do and the industry does 
not tell them." 
</P>
<P>
 It is her task to educate them, helping them understand the law and why it is 
important to protect the waterways and hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the island, the problems are not what the farmer does not know," she said. 
"It is more of a management problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranching is still allowed on Santa Cruz and Santa Rosa islands until the 
property can be acquired by the National Park Service or until leases run out. 
</P>
<P>
 In Minas Gerais, which is considered more advanced than the rest of Brazil in 
its environmental laws, landowners must set aside 20% of their property to 
remain wild. That segment is chosen by the government so the state will always 
have contiguous wild areas. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, all of the watershed is protected. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rivers and lakes are owned by the federation," Sola said. She gave slide 
presentations on the programs that her institute operates. 
</P>
<P>
 Sola said she takes home a wealth of ideas that she is eager to put into 
place. She looks to the strong models she saw here as a means to marry the 
people with the conservation goals of her agency.  
</P>
<P>
 "The real origin of our problems is that we did not consider ourselves and our 
culture as part of the environment," she said. "We have tended to separate the 
two." 
</P>
<P>
 Her intention is to use what she learned to help people "better understand 
where we are in the planet." 
</P>
<P>
 And by so doing, Sola said, she intends to help preserve it.

GETTING FIRED FOR A LIVING; CIRCUS FANS ARE THRILLED BY SPECIAL CALIBER OF 
HUMAN CANNONBALL'S DARING AND SKILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Even among co-workers who kiss lions, ride horseback upside down and 
somersault on the high wire, Jon Weiss is something of a spectacle. 
</P>
<P>
 Five hundred times a year, the 32-year-old Long Island native shimmies down 
the barrel of a huge cannon and waits for an audience countdown to catapult him 
across the Big Top to circus glory. Three, two, one, BOOM! 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss flies out of the cannon's mouth at speeds up to 65 m.p.h. About four 
seconds and 120 feet later, the durable veteran hits the safety net, does a 
forward half-somersault and bounces up to relieved applause. 
</P>
<P>
 Meet the Human Cannonball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the tradition of the cannon," Weiss said. "To think people still get 
shot out of a cannon, it's still amazing even to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss' bit of human rocketry -- the final act each day for the Ringling Bros. 
and Barnum & Bailey Circus, which finishes its Southern California run today at 
The Pond in Anaheim -- thrills crowds wherever he goes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought he was awesome," said Gail Moore, 35, of Moreno Valley, who was at 
the circus this week with her three children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I liked it the way he shot out and flew," said her son Travis, 8. "It was 
cool." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking cool in a daredevil costume while hurtling through midair is no 
accident, Weiss said. It takes lots of practice. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, who joined the circus as a clown in 1982, trained for three months 
before ever crawling inside a cannon. Since 1987, he has been airborne more 
than 3,000 times, including one flight down New York City's 52nd Street for 
"The Late Show With David Letterman." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all technique," said Weiss, who uses his hips and arms to adjust his 
trajectory during his performance. "I want to make sure I don't over-rotate and 
also make sure I'm not coming in straight as an arrow. Otherwise I'll skid on 
my face." 
</P>
<P>
 Before technique, however, you need to be the right body size and type. Only 
if you're small and sturdy can you dream of becoming a human projectile, Weiss 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm built like a fireplug," said the 5-foot-6, 140-pound cannonballer. "You 
have to be compact. Six-foot-two, 190 pounds is way too big." 
</P>
<P>
 Before becoming cannon fodder, Weiss prepares the equipment and himself. 
Depending on the arena, he calibrates the cannon to avoid wires and ceilings, 
and measures the distance and alignment to the net. Then he checks and rechecks 
the height and angle of the barrel. 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to takeoff, Weiss also warms up by jumping rope or running in place. And 
finally, when he's nearly ready to slide down the cannon's throat, he dons 
special knee and back braces for extra support during his flight. 
</P>
<P>
 The force that propels Weiss from the cannon is five times that of gravity. 
Weiss described the sensation this way: "Picture yourself in a car parked in 
the center lane of an expressway, hit from behind by another car going 65 
m.p.h. Even though you are ready for the impact and you've locked every muscle 
in your body, it's still quite a jolt." 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Weiss has sustained his share of injuries being a human 
cannonball. He sometimes has trouble with his neck and a shoulder. He has 
strained an Achilles' tendon. And last year he broke his nose when his knee 
smacked into his head on a landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "My nose has never been the same since," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss said there have been a few deaths associated with the art of flinging a 
human body so far so fast since it began in the late 19th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't like to talk about it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does his wife, Laura, 31. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, I'm worried that he could get killed," she said. "It's a very 
dangerous job, but I have faith in what he does. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather see him in a suit and tie," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 But in spite of her reservations, Laura still pulls the switch that fires her 
husband 11 stories across circus arenas nationwide. The Human Cannonball 
wouldn't have it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only person I can trust on the trigger is my wife," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple, who were married during a performance at Madison Square Garden in 
1986, are expecting their first child in December. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having a little cannonball," Weiss said. "Maybe when he or she is 19 or 
20 they can take my place."

SEEKING JUSTICE, HONOR FOR SLAIN DAUGHTER; SOUTH AFRICA: LINDA BIEHL IS ON HER 
THIRD TRIP TO CAPE TOWN FOR KEY PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH FOUR MEN ACCUSED OF 
KILLING THE FULBRIGHT SCHOLAR MIGHT BE FREED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Soon after Amy Biehl went off to South Africa on a Fulbright Scholarship two 
years ago, she tried in vain to persuade her mother to visit her in Cape Town. 
But at the time, Linda Biehl felt she could not afford the time away from work 
and her teen-age son at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "She kept saying, 'Mom, why don't you come on down,' " said Biehl, 51, of 
Newport Beach. "Those words have come back to haunt me." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a year ago, Amy Biehl, 26, was stoned and stabbed to death in the 
township of Guguletu outside Cape Town. The white student activist, who was 
helping to develop voter registration programs, was driving some black friends 
home when her car was set upon by a crowd of young black men shouting racial 
slurs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bitter irony, it is her daughter's death that eventually took Biehl to 
South Africa. She has gone to attend the criminal proceedings for her 
daughter's accused killers and to look for constructive ways to preserve her 
daughter's memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl now visits a radically different nation than the one her daughter knew 
-- one taking its first tentative steps toward a future without apartheid. 
Biehl has begun to witness the political and social changes that her daughter 
had worked to bring about through her involvement in grass-roots organizations, 
but tragically never lived to see. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Biehl and her eldest daughter, Kim, boarded a plane to Cape Town. 
It was Biehl's third trip to South Africa since her daughter's death. On 
Monday, they will attend a key court hearing that could determine whether the 
accused killers go free. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Cape Town courtroom, Judge President Gerald Friedman is expected to 
decide whether the four men's incriminating statements to police should be 
admissible as evidence in the trial. The four -- Mongezi Manquina, Mzikhona 
Nofemela and Vusumzi Ntamo and an unidentified 15-year-old, say they did not 
commit the crimes and were beaten by police until they confessed. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been charged with murder, robbery and public violence and have been 
free on $70 bail since their arrests. Four other men also were charged, but 
they were freed when witnesses refused to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 If the confessions are thrown out, prosecutors say, they will have no case. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would virtually ruin us because we don't have any other evidence against 
them," said State Advocate Nollie Niehaus, who is handling the case. "One of 
the girls in the car testified that she could identify one of the defendants, 
but then under cross-examination said she could only identify him by his hair. 
That's a bit dicey." 
</P>
<P>
 Several people who allegedly witnessed the attack have refused to talk to 
police or recanted their statements out of fear for their lives, Niehaus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, thousands of miles away in Newport Beach, the Biehls have been 
trying to pick up the pieces of their lives. In addition to Biehl, there is her 
husband, Peter, daughters Molly, 24, and Kim, 28, and a son, Zach, 17. 
</P>
<P>
 As the first anniversary of the slaying approaches, the family continues to 
struggle with the loss of the bright, idealistic young woman who became an 
unlikely martyr in the struggle to free South Africa from apartheid. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been really hard on all of us," Linda Biehl said. "I worry a lot more 
about the kids and trying to help them deal with this in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The Aug. 25, 1993, slaying -- which occurred days before Amy Biehl was to 
return home, gained widespread international attention because she was one of 
the first foreigners killed in South African civil disturbances during 
pre-election violence that claimed more than 9,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the savage nature of the attack, the Biehl family and friends have 
blamed the system of apartheid for fueling the kind of hatred that led to the 
slaying, rather than the individuals involved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't really blame anyone," Biehl said on the eve of her latest trip. "I 
want to understand it. We're just trying to understand it as best we can." 
</P>
<P>
 According to police accounts, Amy Biehl was driving three friends home in 
Guguletu, an impoverished black township, when a brick smashed the windshield 
of her Mazda. 
</P>
<P>
 Her friends frantically urged her to drive on, but she was disoriented after 
reportedly being struck in the face. Screaming, "One settler, one bullet!" a 
group of black youths pulled her from the car, then stabbed and beat her, 
police said. She was dead within half an hour. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors that the four accused men might be pardoned under the new government's 
political amnesty program disturb Biehl. Prosecutor Niehaus says those fears 
are groundless, but Biehl is unconvinced. 
</P>
<P>
 During her trip to South Africa, Biehl plans to meet with Justice Minister 
Dullah Omar to express these concerns. Her daughter had worked for Omar when he 
was director of the University of Western Cape's Community Law Center. Biehl 
said she still has a picture of Omar and her daughter, holding hands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to remind him that Amy was still an important person to us, and 
there should be some accountability in some way for the loss of her life," 
Biehl said. "We're understanding, but we're not forgetting. There's a balance 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl said she tries not to dwell too much on developments at the criminal 
trial. She is doing all she can, she said, to commemorate the anniversary of 
her daughter's death in a way that she would have wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would rather help keep her memory going in a positive way," Biehl said. "If 
they can remember her as a person who was trying to help, then that's the best 
way to honor her legacy." 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing how much the country's first historic, multiracial elections meant to 
her daughter, Biehl traveled to South Africa in February to share in the 
euphoria. She will be in the audience Aug. 18 when President Nelson Mandela 
gives his 100-day State of the Union address before Parliament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Biehls have established the Amy Biehl Fund to help finance grass-roots 
projects, mostly in South Africa, such as those in which the young woman was 
involved before her death. During her 10-month stint as a Fulbright scholar, 
Amy Biehl joined several women's rights groups and helped set up a voter 
education program. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund gave $4,000 to a battered women's shelter in South Africa. The money 
came from the proceeds of a jazz concert in Washington that Molly Biehl helped 
organize. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Biehl plans to visit the shelter this week and says she also will be on 
the lookout for other worthy projects. She is being careful, knowing that her 
presence could inflame passions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be done very carefully and out of concern for not upsetting the 
township," she said. "You don't want to just go bouncing into a situation where 
you're going to cause more havoc than give help." 
</P>
<P>
 When she returns to Newport Beach on Aug. 22, the monumental task of sorting 
through her daughter's research papers and personal effects will await her. 
</P>
<P>
 Biehl plans to send some of the research to Stanford University to help the 
next Fulbright scholar who goes to South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 There also could be a movie in the offing, Biehl said. The family is 
considering an offer, solely to raise money for the nonprofit organization, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With so much activity, Biehl quit her job in December to devote her attention 
to the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just still flooded with things to do," she said. "But you just have to 
kind of roll with it."

WORLD IN BRIEF; RWANDA; MORE HUTUS FLEE AS FRENCH TROOPS LEAVE 
</P>

 A new refugee exodus appeared under way after 5,000 Hutus crossed into Bukavu, 
Zaire, from the Rwandan border town of Cyangugu. U.N. officials said that, in 
the coming week, a million Hutus could stream out of the French-protected zone 
in southwestern Rwanda and into eastern Zaire. International relief workers in 
the French "safe zone" distributed food, shelter and medical supplies -- as 
well as leaflets urging people not to leave -- in a desperate effort to avert a 
new tragedy. The new Hutu refugees are driven by panic over withdrawal of 
French troops and by fear of an ensuing slaughter by the new Tutsi-controlled 
government to avenge the half-million or more deaths of Tutsis by Hutu 
extremists during Rwanda's three-month civil war.

BOSNIAN SERBS SPURN U.N. ENVOY'S PLEA ON BEHALF OF PEACE PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leaders on Saturday rebuffed a top U.N. official's plea to accept 
an international peace plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic said after meeting with U.N. envoy 
Thorvald Stoltenberg that maps calling for Bosnian Serbs to settle for 49% of 
the republic "cannot be accepted." 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs currently hold 70% of Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Stoltenberg met with Bosnian Serb leaders at their headquarters in Pale on 
Saturday after holding talks Friday in the capital of Serb-dominated Yugoslavia 
with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at U.N. headquarters in New York characterized Stoltenberg's trip as 
an urgent mission to persuade Bosnian Serbs to accept an international peace 
plan they repeatedly have rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 Milosevic, widely regarded as the instigator of Bosnia's war, is trying to 
force Bosnian Serbs to agree to a peace plan, hoping his efforts will lead to 
the lifting of international sanctions against Yugoslavia. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnia's Croats and the Muslim-led government have accepted the plan, which 
would give their federation 51% of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian war began in April, 1992, when Serbs rebelled against a vote by 
Muslims and Croats, who together formed a majority in Bosnia, to secede from 
Yugoslavia.  
</P>
<P>
 In other developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Explosions and machine-gun fire erupted Friday night around Sarajevo's 
Jewish cemetery, one of the most hotly contested fronts in the Bosnian capital. 
There was no clear indication of what started the fighting, and no word on 
casualties.  
</P>
<P>
 Sarajevo's airport partially reopened Saturday, after both sides reassured the 
United Nations. Flights have been canceled for most of the past three weeks 
because of shooting at aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.N. spokesman Maj. Rob Annink reported three more abortive efforts by 
Bosnian Serbs on Friday to remove heavy weapons from U.N. collection points 
around Sarajevo. One such effort on Aug. 5 led to a NATO air strike. 
</P>
<P>
 * Croatian President Franjo Tudjman warned the U.N. Security Council in a 
letter that his country would not tolerate persistent attacks from rebel Serbs 
in Croatia, such as the shelling of the Dubrovnik airport Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A cease-fire agreement 2 1/2 years ago ended six months of war between Croatia 
and the republic's Serbs that killed 10,000 people, but efforts to negotiate a 
more comprehensive peace have stalled.

WALLS OF FRUSTRATION HAVEN'T TUMBLED IN JERICHO; MIDEAST: MANY IN THE WEST BANK 
TOWN ARE AS UNHAPPY WITH SELF-RULE AS THEY WERE WITH ISRAELI OCCUPIERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the summer of Jericho's discontent. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaking off its reputation as a sleepy, sun-scorched desert oasis whose 
residents are concerned more with farming than with politics, Jericho has 
emerged as an unexpected focal point of unhappiness with the new Palestinian 
self-governing authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, Jericho merchants pulled down the steel doors that shutter 
their shops and joined a citywide protest against the Palestinian Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first such protest in the territories since the Palestinians began 
taking over government functions from the Israeli occupiers in May. Every few 
days, another protest rally is held by one faction or another with a new list 
of complaints about the authority. 
</P>
<P>
 Jericho residents also are bombarding Palestine Liberation Organization 
Chairman Yasser Arafat with petitions imploring him to visit Jericho and deal 
with its many problems. 
</P>
<P>
 They complain openly about Arafat's decision to make his home in the Gaza 
Strip rather than the West Bank, his failure to spend more than a single day in 
Jericho and what they say is the incompetence of the Palestinian authorities 
who are supposed to be running their daily lives. They fret about the high 
profile of Palestinian police in the city and the tight limitations on 
self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people are always suffering," said Mansour Salaima, head of the Jericho 
Chamber of Commerce. "They used to suffer before, when the Israelis were here, 
and they are still suffering now. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a problem between the people and the authorities now," Salaima said. 
"The people haven't seen any changes since the Israelis left. The authority 
here is just a mediator, or a machine in the hands of the Israelis." 
</P>
<P>
 Other West Bank Palestinians used to joke about the lack of enthusiasm among 
Jericho residents for the Palestinian uprising, or intifada , against Israel's 
military rule of the occupied territories. Jericho's 12,000 permanent residents 
didn't hear about the intifada until seven months after it erupted, the other 
Palestinians would say. Activists scornfully referred to the town as 
"collaborator city," an allusion to the good relations many Jerichoans 
maintained with the Israeli civil and military administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Jericho has always been a popular tourist stop, a town of graceful date palms 
and archeological sites that recall a history dating back 10,000 years. Trinket 
shops and fruit and vegetable stands still far outnumber portraits of Arafat in 
the town's main square. Some of the restaurants that cater to tourists never 
bothered to close on designated strike days throughout the seven-year 
Palestinian revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jericho's profile began to change when Israel and the PLO agreed to begin 
the experiment with Palestinian self-governance in Gaza and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 Jericho was the symbolic toehold for the PLO in the West Bank. Its inclusion 
in the September, 1993, accord on self-rule in the territories was meant to 
reassure Palestinians that Israel wasn't simply ceding Gaza to them but was 
promising eventual self-government in most of the territories that Israel 
captured in the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. 
</P>
<P>
 After Israel and the PLO signed the agreement, "every bastard in the West Bank 
opened an office in Jericho," said a senior Israeli official who spoke on 
condition of anonymity. Suddenly, groups ranging from the Islamic 
fundamentalist organization Hamas to the former Communist Party rushed to 
establish a presence in Jericho. Various factions began holding rallies in the 
town, preparing for the Israeli troop withdrawal and hand-over of municipal 
functions. 
</P>
<P>
 Tensions were exacerbated, according to Palestinian analysts, when PLO 
officials and police officers from outside the territories began to converge on 
the town. Police officers, with no place to live and little pay, soon began 
imposing on local residents for lodging, food and other essentials. Friction 
developed between residents and the newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Israelis withdrew their troops from downtown Jericho in May, "they 
left behind nothing, administratively speaking," said Saeb Erekat, minister of 
local government in the Palestinian Authority. The new administrators were left 
with problems ranging from a disintegrating water supply system to a shortage 
of housing for 300 freed Palestinian prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 Erekat, a former member of the Palestinian peace negotiating team, is the most 
senior Palestinian civilian official based in Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people have a point" when they complain that life has not improved since 
the Palestinian Authority took over, Erekat conceded. But he blames most of the 
problems on a combination of Israeli lack of cooperation with the Palestinian 
Authority, the authority's acute lack of funds and residents' high 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people come home and switch their lights on, they expect light. They get 
furious if they throw the switch and nothing happens; that's normal," Erekat 
said. "Texts of agreements mean nothing to the man on the street. The agreement 
is not Arafat and (Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak) Rabin signing a piece of 
paper, it is changes on the ground, and people feeling these changes on the 
ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Erekat speaks proudly of now having 24 municipal offices up and 
running in the freshly whitewashed former vocational school that is his 
headquarters, he says those offices have been able to do little yet that makes 
a difference in people's lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of Erekat's problem is that there is no clear line of authority in 
Jericho. He issues orders, but so does Maj. Gen. Hajj Ismail Jaber, the colonel 
in charge of what used to be the Palestine Liberation Army and is now the 
1,000-strong Palestinian police force in town. There also are three separate 
intelligence services. There are joint Israeli-Palestinian police patrols 
through the city. Another joint committee is responsible for issuing permits, 
and Jerichoans say the bureaucratic tangle is nightmarish. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were expecting, with peace, we would be able to move freely," said Tawfiq 
Nweiser, head of the Chamber of Commerce's agricultural committee. "But now it 
takes much more time to move from Jericho to, say, Jerusalem. We must wait for 
permissions. Then we must wait at checkpoints. And sometimes we get turned back 
from checkpoints." 
</P>
<P>
 Nweiser and other Jerichoans complain that they used to go to the Israeli 
civil administration to obtain such documents as birth certificates and permits 
allowing them to work in Israel. Now, they must apply to the 
Palestinian-Israeli joint committee. Documents that used to be processed in a 
matter of days often take a month or more, or simply disappear into the 
still-chaotic bureaucracy. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, many Jerichoans insist, lies in getting Arafat to pay attention to 
their town and troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people want Arafat to be in Jericho, to see the situation in Jericho. 
They want Arafat to hear their requests, to tell him personally about their 
problems. They don't want a mediator," Salaima said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need months, probably years to convince people that we have a system now," 
Erekat said. "They think that if they don't meet Arafat, they're not important. 
They want the chance to complain to him about us." 
</P>
<P>
 Erekat indicated that he thinks it might be a good idea for Arafat, who 
visited Jericho for only four hours after choosing to base his operations in 
Gaza, to visit soon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jericho is ignored, which means the West Bank is ignored," Erekat said. "The 
people want to see their leader." 
</P>
<P>
 "I have met with Arafat, I have asked him to come to Jericho," Nweiser said. 
"He always says: ' Inshallah (God willing) I will come. Soon.' "PALESTINIAN AU

 Saudi Arabia and AT&T signed a $4-billion contract for what the company called 
the world's most extensive telecommunications project.The contract will almost 
double Saudi Arabia's number of telephone subscribers, giving the kingdom 1.5 
million new digital lines and 200,000 mobile lines for its 17 million people. 
AT&T will install a digital system that turns signals into the language of 
computers, allowing them to be handled by more devices than ordinary 
telephones, AT&T Chairman Robert E. Allen said. The project is expected to be 
completed in about seven years.

 A Bangladeshi soldier was killed and two others were wounded when U.N. 
peacekeepers were ambushed on the Iraqi side of the demilitarized zone between 
Iraq and Kuwait, the Kuwait News Agency reported.Sources with the U.N. 
Iraq-Kuwait Observation Mission said the shooting occurred near the Iraqi town 
of Safwan in the zone, which runs six miles into Iraq. They provided no details 
of the incident. The official Iraqi News Agency, monitored in Cyprus, said the 
attack was carried out by smugglers after the Bangladeshis confiscated liquor 
they had intended to bring into Kuwait. It was the third time since November 
that U.N. personnel have come under fire in the Iraqi sector of the zone.

GERMAN POLICE CONFIRM SEIZURE OF NUCLEAR FUEL SMUGGLED FROM RUSSIA; EUROPE: 
CACHE ON FLIGHT FROM MOSCOW WAS THIRD FOUND THIS YEAR. OFFICIALS THINK IT WAS 
HEADED FOR BLACK MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 German police have made their third and largest seizure this year of 
weapons-grade nuclear material apparently smuggled from the former Soviet Union 
for sale on the world black market, officials said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bavaria state police in Munich confirmed reports by the weekly magazines Der 
Spiegel and Focus that they confiscated a stash of highly enriched plutonium 
hidden in the suitcase of a passenger on a Lufthansa flight from Moscow on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 German media reported that three suspects, two Spaniards and a Colombian, were 
arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The seizure supports warnings by U.S. and German officials of a growing 
post-Cold War black market in radioactive materials. German authorities say 
their country is a primary transit route for the smugglers, and they suspect 
that the buyers of the nuclear materials could be terrorist organizations or 
the governments of Iran, Iraq, Libya or North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a grave danger, not only for us but for many (countries)," Chancellor 
Helmut Kohl told the German television network ZDF. 
</P>
<P>
 On a trip through Germany, Poland and Russia in early July, FBI Director Louis 
J. Freeh called nuclear smuggling operations "the greatest long-term threat to 
the security of the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The exact quantity of plutonium confiscated Wednesday was still uncertain, but 
it was at least 10 times as great as the previous find and potentially worth 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said experts at a European atomic research institute in Karlsruhe were 
examining 100 to 300 grams of what could be pure plutonium-239, which can be 
used to build a nuclear bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Der Spiegel reported that 500 grams of a "fine dark-brown powder" was 
confiscated by police but that nuclear experts had indicated only about 50 
grams of it was usable for nuclear weapons. Final test results are not expected 
for several days. 
</P>
<P>
 About three to five kilograms -- approximately seven to 11 pounds -- of 
plutonium are needed to build an atomic bomb, according to one scientific 
expert. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course the worry is that it might be we only catch one of five (shipments) 
and they all have the same buyer," the expert said. 
</P>
<P>
 German authorities have handled about 250 cases involving supposed radioactive 
substances since the collapse of the Soviet Union. All but three turned out to 
be scams in which con men were trying to peddle fake bomb material. 
</P>
<P>
 The three exceptions, however, have alarmed officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Last May, police in the southwestern state of Baden-Wurttemberg arrested 
businessman Adolf Jaekle on suspicion of counterfeiting and found six grams of 
nearly pure plutonium-239 in his garage. Tests showed that the sample was of 
Russian origin, probably from a nuclear weapons factory. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Bavarian police announced that during June and July they arrested 
five East European men and a German woman for smuggling one gram of enriched 
uranium-235, believed to have come from a Russian nuclear power station or 
submarine. The woman, a real estate agent, was believed to be the leader of 
that smuggling band. 
</P>
<P>
 Several German media reported Saturday that a police informant helped obtain 
the most recent arrests at the Munich airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Der Spiegel quoted German intelligence officials as saying that the operation 
possibly had been organized by Libyan, Iranian or Iraqi diplomats. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said the plutonium was carried in a lead-lined steel box and that no 
passengers, flight crew or ground crew had been exposed to danger. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not known if the three seizures in Germany are related. The exact 
sources of the nuclear materials are unknown, although all are believed to have 
come from Russia or the former Soviet republics.  
</P>
<P>
 Germany's DPA news agency said Russian government agencies had no information 
on the most recent seizure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up to now, not a single plutonium loss has been recorded," one Russian 
official told DPA. 
</P>
<P>
 But Russian police also have announced several arrests and seizures of nuclear 
materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Kohl said he wrote to Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin on the issue before 
leaving for vacation in Austria last month and that the two will speak about 
the issue when Kohl returns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will also very quickly send an envoy to him to find out what we can do to 
establish once and for all where these things come from. We do not know this. 
Secondly, every possible step must be taken to prevent such things from 
happening in the future," Kohl said. 
</P>
<P>
 Poorly paid workers at former Soviet nuclear facilities are among those 
suspected of selling the nuclear material. The smuggling is being done by 
low-level criminal gangs willing to peddle anything from narcotics to currency 
to weapons, authorities say. But they also fear that organized crime in Russia 
or Italy will get into the business. 
</P>
<P>
 Der Spiegel reported that the Russian deputy minister for nuclear energy, 
Viktor Sidorenko, was aboard the flight from Moscow on which the latest stash 
was discovered. He was flying to Germany to meet with Bavarian officials about 
civilian nuclear projects. 
</P>
<P>
 A police spokesman would not comment on whether Sidorenko was a suspect in the 
smuggling, but one source said his presence was believed to be an "ironic 
coincidence."

N. KOREAN SEES NEW ERA IN U.S. RELATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A senior North Korean official said Saturday that a nuclear accord between 
North Korea and the United States will help forge a new era of normal relations 
between the two countries by establishing a basis for enhanced "trust and 
confidence" on nuclear issues and other matters. 
</P>
<P>
 In a rare interview, Deputy Foreign Minister Kang Sok Ju, the chief North 
Korean negotiator on nuclear matters, hailed the two-page statement of 
understanding approved by the U.S. and North Korean governments as an 
expression of "our clear intentions to resolve our nuclear issue." 
</P>
<P>
 The deal calls for Washington to arrange for construction of several 
Western-style nuclear reactors in North Korea and to move toward establishing 
normal diplomatic relations. In return, it commits North Korea to halting its 
production of plutonium for possible use in nuclear arms, and eventually to 
halting work on several reactors that are considered tailor-made for plutonium 
production. 
</P>
<P>
 Kang declined to express confidence that all unresolved disputes can be 
settled, but he said all would be addressed in discussions with U.S. technical 
experts. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Secretary of State Robert L. Gallucci, who spoke at a news 
conference at 2 a.m. Saturday, agreed that the talks had reduced suspicion 
about the likelihood of progress. He said the level of trust between the 
delegations was "higher than it was before this round of talks" and called the 
accord an important "first step" toward a broader nuclear agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Further negotiations are scheduled in Geneva on Sept. 23 on the interim energy 
alternatives North Korea has been promised, establishing liaison offices in 
Washington and Pyongyang as a first step to full mutual recognition, final 
disposal of about 8,000 spent nuclear fuel rods now corroding in a cooling pond 
north of Pyongyang, and providing the new reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid hefty costs to the U.S. taxpayer, Gallucci is trying to arrange for 
Germany and Japan, and perhaps South Korea, to pay most of the cost of the new 
reactors, which would be provided by South Korea or Russia. The United States 
would supply technical experts.

JAPANESE OFFICIAL TO QUIT POST

<P>
 The head of Japan's Environmental Agency said he will resign to take 
responsibility for protests over comments he made about Japan's role in World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 He is the second Japanese Cabinet member to be forced out of office this year 
over remarks about Japan's role in the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Shin Sakurai said he informed Deputy Prime Minister Yohei Kono this morning 
that he plans to resign, the Kyodo news service reported. It wasn't known when 
he would formally submit his resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy began Friday, when Sakurai said Japan did not intend to wage a 
war of aggression and that its policies led to Asia's independence and economic 
growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours later, he retracted his statement as "inappropriate" after the South 
Korean government protested. 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama sharply rebuked Sakurai for the comment, and 
apologized to both South Korea and China, which also protested. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, Justice Minister Shigeto Nagano was forced to resign after he denied 
that the Rape of Nanking -- in which scholars say between 200,000 and 300,000 
people were killed in what is now Nanjing, China -- ever occurred.

THOUSANDS TO OVERSEE MEXICO VOTE; ELECTION: GOAL OF OBSERVERS IS TO DETER 
FRAUD. SOME DECRY RESTRICTIONS ON FIRST-EVER FOREIGN POLL WATCHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUANITA DARLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the big questions as next Sunday's presidential election nears is 
whether there will be room in the polling places for the voters after all the 
observers arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of fraud-ridden elections over six decades have created a distrust so 
profound that the only hope of convincing Mexicans that the balloting will be 
clean seems to be layer upon layer of vigilance. 
</P>
<P>
 Each polling place will be staffed by four precinct officers; each of the nine 
political parties is entitled to have a representative present, and 21,439 
Mexican observers are accredited to watch over the voting process. But by far 
the most controversial of the poll watchers who will crowd into 94,147 
precincts across the country are the international visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even accorded the status of observers in sovereignty-conscious Mexico, 
more than 654 visitors from nations as diverse as Haiti and Germany, but 
predominantly from the United States, will arrive this week to start training 
as poll watchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as Donald Coan of Sacramento, are veteran observers. The 
67-year-old retired Sacramento County welfare department employee observed 
elections in Nicaragua and El Salvador, which he termed exemplary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm concerned about U.S. policy in that part of the world," said Coan, who 
has cultivated an interest in Mexico since 1951, when he spent a year in the 
tiny Pacific Coast state of Nayarit, working with the American Friends Service 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as 28-year-old Eric Quezada of San Francisco, will be watching a 
foreign election for the first time. Quezada said he became more aware of 
Mexico's importance to the United States when he was coordinating an education 
program in a predominantly Mexican neighborhood in East Palo Alto, helping 
students with homework and organizing workshops for their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is really important that we as North Americans play a positive role in 
supporting a movement toward democracy that will help relations between the 
United States and Mexico," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there is the usual list of dignitaries: former Canadian Prime Minister 
Joe Clark; Jim Wright, former Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, and 
Hortensia Bussi, widow of slain Chilean President Salvador Allende. The think 
tanks of the two major U.S. political parties -- which are funded by the U.S. 
Congress -- are sponsoring a combined delegation of 60 visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican observers have become fixtures at state elections over the past six 
years. Opposition parties and citizens groups routinely ask out-of-state 
intellectuals to tour their precincts, looking for electoral fraud. Their 
reports have been used with mixed results to bolster opposition claims of foul 
play on the part of the ruling party. 
</P>
<P>
 Political party precinct representatives have also made inroads. At a recent 
election in the northern state of Sinaloa, a representative of the conservative 
National Action Party (PAN) insisted that the voting booth in the mountain 
village of El Verano be set up to assure voters of secrecy. 
</P>
<P>
 In that election, for the first time any villagers could remember, two people 
voted for PAN. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection of precinct officers has also become increasingly more 
democratic, making ballot-stuffing and ballot-burning less likely. For this 
election, precinct officers were chosen from voter rolls by a double lottery, 
selected first by birth month, then by first letter of the last name. 
</P>
<P>
 But the innovation that has attracted the most attention is the presence of 
accredited foreigners. Nationalistic Mexicans are deeply divided on whether 
their government should have authorized foreign visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecilia Soto, presidential candidate for the Workers' Party, which with 
110,000 members is unlikely to be able to send representatives to all 
precincts, said the presence of foreign visitors signals that Mexico is bowing 
to international pressure. Shrugging, she added, "I don't think this is a good 
idea, but there is nothing to be done about it now." 
</P>
<P>
 Others say the restrictions that have been placed on foreign visitors make 
them all but ineffectual as observers. For example, Mexico's Civic Alliance, an 
umbrella organization for Mexican election observers, will coordinate the 
visits of many foreigners as well -- on the condition that they do not make any 
public statements until a joint news conference with Mexican observers after 
the official announcement of the vote tallies on Aug. 24, three days after the 
balloting. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, rules for accreditation were strict. Mexico's Federal Electoral 
Institute rejected only 10 applications outright: four for inadequate proof of 
identification, four because the applicants were Mexican and two from minors. 
But others have been left hanging. 
</P>
<P>
 "They certainly are not making it easy," said Medea Benjamin, who is 
coordinating the biggest single contingent, 110 people whose visit was 
organized by the San Francisco-based Global Exchange Network, which has also 
organized tours to observe elections in El Salvador and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign visitors had less than three weeks to provide the electoral institute 
with copies of passports, resumes and photographs, she said. Many would-be 
visitors were unprepared because Mexico does not require passports from U.S. 
tourists.

2ND ATTEMPT TO LIFT ROBOT OUT OF VOLCANO SUCCEEDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Dante II robot that spider-walked its way into a volcanic crater was 
lifted out by helicopter Saturday, more than a week after a misstep sent the 
1,700-pound NASA explorer sprawling in the boulder-strewn landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists from Carnegie Mellon University took advantage of good weather to 
mount the rushed retrieval of the eight-legged robot, developed for NASA and 
brought to Alaska to test its ability to explore terrain similar to that 
encountered on other planets. 
</P>
<P>
 A Kenai Air Alaska helicopter lifted the robot from its rocky perch about 400 
feet below the rim of the volcanic crater at Mt. Spurr and set it down on a 
runway several thousand feet lower on the mountain, said Terry Keith, 
scientist-in-charge at the Alaska Volcano Observatory here. 
</P>
<P>
 From the remote volcano, the robot was to be flown about 60 miles across Cook 
Inlet to Kenai, where the helicopter that lifted it is based. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith said one of her workers and another experienced rock climber from 
Anchorage climbed down into the crater and manually wrapped a sling around 
Dante and attached it to a line hanging down from the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very easy slinging job," Keith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dante got into trouble while climbing out of the crater after a week of 
walking and gathering scientific data deep inside the volcano, which erupted 
three times in 1992 after 39 years of dormancy. 
</P>
<P>
 While picking its way up from the crater floor, the $1.7-million robot tipped 
over Aug. 5 after getting mired in a 30-degree slope of mud created when sunny, 
warm weather melted snow cover that had made walking down into the crater easy 
for Dante.

SENATE OKS DIETARY SUPPLEMENT BILL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate passed a compromise bill Saturday that would prevent the Food and 
Drug Administration from regulating dietary supplements as strictly as it does 
prescription drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the measure would make manufacturers of vitamins, minerals, herbal 
products and amino acids comply with a nutrition labeling law for two years 
until a new commission decides the most appropriate way to deal with dietary 
supplements. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, the Nutrition Labeling and Education Act says there must be 
"significant scientific agreement" before a manufacturer could claim a vitamin 
prevents a certain disease. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate-passed bill would put health claims for foods and dietary 
supplements on the same basis for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Orrin G. Hatch (R-Utah), who has led the fight against stricter FDA 
regulation of the $4-billion-a-year dietary supplements industry, called it a 
major breakthrough.

THE FINE LINE BETWEEN HEROISM AND A MISTAKE; SHOOTING: POLICE CONFRONTED A 
YOUTH WHO THEY BELIEVED HAD A GUN. THE DECISION WAS DEADLY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By City by City Here are the nation's six biggest urban police departments and 
the number of people shot to death by officers last year. Los Angeles had the 
second-highest rate of fatalities per officer among the group, behind 
Washington, D.C. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tip came on Halloween: Tensions were running hot between two gangs in the 
Adams district, and there might be a drive-by shooting that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover officers David Rosenberg and Donald Williams, with trash from their 
fast-food dinner still strewn in the back of their Oldsmobile, were cruising 
Hoover Street when they saw two carloads of teen-agers trading gang signals. 
With youngsters trick-or-treating nearby, the officers worried that the trouble 
might escalate. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer came quickly, according to police reports and court documents, and 
the outcome that night four years ago underscored the fine and often 
frustrating line between heroism and tragic mistakes in the policing of a 
violence-torn city. 
</P>
<P>
 One teen-ager in one car suddenly jumped out, wrapped a sweat shirt around his 
hand and pointed it at two rivals as they fled down the street. This was it, 
the officers figured. They sped up to the curb, within about 10 feet of the 
suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg yelled, "I'm a police officer -- stop!" he recalled in his report. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the officers said, the youth -- 17-year-old Julio Cesar Moran, who 
had been in and out of juvenile halls for increasingly violent offenses -- 
walked up to the officers' car and raised his arms toward them with both of his 
hands wrapped in the sweat shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 The two officers fired -- 18 rounds in all. Seven shots hit Moran, killing 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Only after the youth had fallen face-up on the sidewalk with the sweat shirt 
still wrapped around one hand did the officers discover the truth: There was no 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors declared the shooting justified. They said that "(Moran) not only 
fooled the two gang members walking on the street, but the officers as well, 
and it cost him his life." 
</P>
<P>
 As in dozens of previous cases, police ordered training for both men in light 
of errors that had put them at a "severe tactical disadvantage." Their biggest 
problem, police found, was that they had confronted Moran so closely that they 
had little time to defuse the situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The case did not end there. Rosenberg later went on disability leave and began 
taking medication for anxiety because of the shooting, he said in a deposition. 
The city paid $165,000 this year to settle the Moran family's claim. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervising investigator who was on the scene that night gave a deposition 
on the family's behalf. He said he believed Moran died in "a bad shooting." 
</P>
<P>
 "This young man was 17 years old," investigator Zvoncko Pavelic said. "We 
can't be going around doing these kind of things, and then send a green light 
to the officers: 'Hey, buddy, everything you did was right.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg, testifying in his own defense, said he had no choice. "Have you 
ever had a gun pointed at you?" the officer asked the plaintiff's attorney. "He 
pointed his hands at me as if he was about to blow my face off." City by City 
Here are the nation's six biggest urban police departments and the number of 
people shot to death by officers last year. Los Angeles had the second-highest 
rate of fatalities per officer among the group, behind Washington, D.C.

BABBITT JOINS EFFORT TO PUT OUT WILDFIRE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt joined the front fire lines Saturday, 
shoveling and stamping out embers of a 1,300-acre wildfire. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Babbitt's third time assisting hot shot crews in the fires throughout 
the Western states this season, said Jan Bedrosian, a spokeswoman for the 
Bureau of Land Management. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was doing pretty good. The guys were just treating him like one of the 
guys," Bedrosian said of Babbitt, who earned his certification to fight fires 
this spring.  
</P>
<P>
 The fire, which is burning in a forest area between Truckee and Reno, Nev., 
was 100% contained at 6 a.m. Saturday. It was unclear when the fire would be 
controlled, said Karen Finlayson, a spokeswoman at the fire information center. 
</P>
<P>
 Finlayson said that 1,301 firefighters were battling the blaze. Four 
firefighters were injured, including one who suffered a broken collarbone, she 
added.  
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in Northern California, firefighters launched an aggressive effort 
to smother the last embers of two other fires. Moderate weather conditions 
helped their efforts, fire officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Near Nevada City in the Sierra Nevada foothills, the 100-acre Champion Fire 
that destroyed two homes was expected to be controlled by 9 p.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuolumne County, residents who were chased from their houses by a 
1,400-acre wildfire were back home as firefighters finished quelling the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The creek fire was contained Friday evening and was expected to be out by 
Sunday evening, said Mary Hale, a spokeswoman for the U.S. Forest Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a fire burning since late May in a remote area southeast of Glacier 
Point in Yosemite National Park expanded Friday, park officials said.

RARE WEEKEND HEALTH CARE SENATE DEBATE BOGS DOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate, convening in a rare weekend session to continue its debate on 
health care reform, quickly became mired in partisan bickering Saturday and 
adjourned after about seven hours of nonstop talk, but no action. 
</P>
<P>
 Frustrated Democrats accused Republicans of engaging in a poorly disguised 
filibuster designed to block floor action, while Republicans accused Democrats 
of trying to rush through a complex piece of legislation without allowing 
enough time for members to study it. 
</P>
<P>
 The partisan wrangling -- and the passing of another day with no tangible 
progress on health care -- was another ominous sign for President Clinton's top 
domestic priority, particularly in light of the House's decision Thursday to 
put off debate on the issue indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate was to have begun a monthlong summer vacation on Saturday, but it 
now appears it could stay in session for several weeks. Majority Leader George 
J. Mitchell (D-Me.) has said the Senate will continue meeting six days a week 
until it completes action on health care reform. 
</P>
<P>
 The ostensible point of debate Saturday was a two-page amendment by Sen. 
Christopher J. Dodd (D-Conn.) that would require private health plans to offer 
perinatal care and childhood immunizations by January, well before the 
effective date of other reform provisions.  
</P>
<P>
 But as one Republican after another took to the floor to criticize the 
Mitchell bill, a frustrated Dodd called a press conference to accuse the 
Republicans of engaging in "a good old-fashioned filibuster." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell himself lamented on the Senate floor: "We are in a situation where 
debate will continue with no assurance, as of today, as to whether votes will 
be permitted." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas denied that his forces were 
engaging in a filibuster, a parliamentary tactic that allows senators to engage 
in nonstop debate unless a three-fifths majority votes to end it. Even so, 
Dole's remarks all but confirmed that the Republicans were indeed 
filibustering. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we have the right to make opening statements. This is a very 
important bill," Dole said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the House Democratic leadership -- faced with insufficient support 
for its health care reform plan -- put off debate on the measure indefinitely.

ON THE WATERFRONT; LITTLE PORT HUENEME TOUGHS IT OUT IN SHIPPING WORLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The sun set with a pinkish glow as ship's pilot Andrew Harvey maneuvered the 
rusty, 500-foot Sun Belt Dixie out of tiny Port Hueneme harbor and into the 
open sea. 
</P>
<P>
 His firm voice echoed through loud speakers on two tugboats that pulled the 
old ship, which was loaded with grapefruit, oranges, lemons and tangerines 
bound for Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Move right," he commanded. "Back easy." 
</P>
<P>
 After 45 minutes of barking orders, Harvey had guided the ship out of a narrow 
slip, into the port's main channel and a mile out to sea, where he turned over 
control to the captain and climbed down a dangling rope ladder to a waiting 
tugboat. 
</P>
<P>
 For Harvey and dozens other dockworkers and ship hands, the Sun Belt Dixie's 
departure was just the beginning of a sometimes hectic, mostly tedious night 
shift at the port. 
</P>
<P>
 Situated at the southernmost tip of Port Hueneme, near the end of Ventura 
Road, the 80-acre, five-berth port is small -- moving just 1% as much cargo as 
the Port of Los Angeles -- but it is still the only deep-water harbor between 
Los Angeles and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 It operates 24 hours a day, unloading Mazdas, BMWs and Volvos and loading 
California citrus and vegetables onto ships headed to the nations of the 
Pacific Rim. The port pours $200 million into the local economy each year and, 
directly and indirectly, creates about 2,000 jobs, spokesman W. Kam Quarles of 
the Oxnard Harbor District said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a typical day, three ships will come and go. But nights are sometimes busy 
too, since delays are so costly that ships cannot afford to wait for the dawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can go from having a few dozen people working one night, to a few hundred 
(another)," said Harvey, 50, one of two harbor district pilots employed to 
steer large ships in and out of the port, a job they do instead of regular sea 
captains because of their local knowledge. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends," added Harvey, "on when the ships are arriving and leaving."  
</P>
<P>
 Quiet and dimly lit, the port bustled one recent night only when the Sun Belt 
Dixie departed and, seven hours later, when a second cargo ship arrived to 
gather tons of onions for customers in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 After putting the Sun Belt Dixie to sea, those who helped pilot and tug it 
free settled into a comfortable stillness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now we sit here, drink coffee and tell old sea stories we have already told," 
Harvey said as he joined wharfinger Karl Britt, a port traffic manager, in a 
small metal office. "That is, until we go crazy again." 
</P>
<P>
 The office was lit only by a dim red light, so Britt could peer without glare 
through a large window at ships in the harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 Each told a story about the single most dangerous act ship pilots regularly 
endure -- the leap from one ship to another in open sea. Harvey told of a pilot 
who fell into the ocean near San Francisco and nearly froze to death before 
being rescued. 
</P>
<P>
 Britt told of a Port Hueneme pilot who, buffeted by high swells, had trouble 
bridging the gap from a ship to a tugboat and ended up stranded on a rope 
ladder. He eventually took the ship to Long Beach before returning home by car. 
</P>
<P>
 As the two veteran seamen told stories, the smell of onions wafted through the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to a giant open-air storage shed, dozens of longshoremen hoisted hundreds 
of pallets of onions off big rig trucks from Stockton, Bakersfield and farm 
communities beyond. 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Hernandez and his son, David, worked side by side, whirling their 
forklifts to hook pallet after pallet and deposit them under the shed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am celebrating my birthday here with a lot of onions," said Joel Hernandez, 
57. "I think I will be smelling and dreaming of onions for a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hernandezes, dressed in blue jeans and T-shirts, would unload onions their 
entire shift, except for a quick trip to their nearby home for a birthday 
dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By 10 p.m. a strange quietness had settled over the port. Only the cry of sea 
gulls, the bark of seals and the distant hum of the forklifts broke the 
silence. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in a while, a taxi would drop off a sailor at the Crystal Pilgram, a 
small cargo ship that had brought bananas from Equador earlier that day. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the Sea Angler, a sport-fishing boat returning from an evening 
excursion. Toting fishing poles and bags of calico bass and barracuda, 14 
shivering men and women rushed from the boat to their cars, leaving only the 
crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeping the boat's kitchen floor, 19-year-old Becky Lidz of Ventura had 
already worked a 17-hour day: "I'm ready to hit the sack." 
</P>
<P>
 Lidz, a 1993 Buena High School graduate, has been boat cook for a year, making 
hamburgers, hot dogs and chicken sandwiches for one or two trips a day. This 
day there were two, and Lidz had reported to work at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a summer job, you can't beat it," she said. "I saw dolphins yesterday, 
and today I am taking fresh bass home. But it gets cold in the winter." 
</P>
<P>
 As Lidz tossed her broom aside and grabbed a brown backpack to leave, 
16-year-old Jeff Gardener hosed down squawking sea gulls that were scavenging 
left-over anchovy bait. 
</P>
<P>
 "They love that staff," Jeff said. A student at Camarillo High School, he said 
he has worked on the Sea Angler every recent summer, pulling the anchor, 
cutting bait and scrubbing the boat. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff said he replaced his older brother as the boat handyman years ago. But he 
has no plans to leave the salt air and open sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Harvey was deep into the tedium of waiting for another ship to come 
in. 
</P>
<P>
 Since returning from the Sun Belt Dixie, the pilot had waited for the Jorgen 
Lauritzen, the Danish ship that would take the Hernandezes' onions to Japan. 
Because of engine problems, it was four hours late. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever you can, you grab some sleep," Harvey said, before catching a nap on 
a tugboat bunk. "You got to be totally alert when you are out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Harvey's familiarity with local water currents, turning basin and 
tugboats, he is better equipped to avoid accidents than the ship captains who 
come only once in a while, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The captain of a ship could navigate a vessel in and out of the harbor," 
Harvey said. "But he would be asking for trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At midnight four big rigs loaded with broccoli from Stockton arrived at the 
port's security gate. The drivers flashed documents to a guard who alternately 
glanced at some, then closely examined others. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recognize a lot of the truck drivers," said guard Doug Devine, 66, a 
retired sailor who has worked at the port for two years. 
</P>
<P>
 Devine said his life at the port is problem-free, except for drunk sailors and 
skate-boarding youths who try to slip past him into the port. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have many problems," Devine said, as he poured coffee from a 
thermos. 
</P>
<P>
 But not too long ago, Devine and the wharfinger had to carry a drunk sailor 
back to his ship after he tried to ride a bike onto the wharf at 2 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Between truck arrivals, Devine reads history books while listening to police 
scanners and easy-listening radio. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the type of job I can do until I die," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, a fisherman lolled patiently in an old pine chair and gazed into the 
harbor's dark water. Eric Najolia of Ventura had come to the port three hours 
early to get a good spot on a fishing boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fishing runs through my veins," he said. "Getting a good spot makes a big 
difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in faded jeans and a floppy fishing hat, carrying four poles and a 
tackle box, Najolia fantasized about catching the large, aggressive calico 
bass. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's what everyone wants to catch," Najolia said, sipping a cola. "They put 
up a good fight."  
</P>
<P>
 It was 2 a.m., and Najolia was not due to depart until 4. 
</P>
<P>
 But time had begun press on Harvey, who had been rousted from his bunk by 
wharfinger Britt. 
</P>
<P>
 After brushing his teeth and pouring a steaming cup of coffee, Harvey was on 
the radio with the captain of the Jorgen Lauritzen, which was churning up the 
coast from Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying to get my act together," Harvey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot's crew and the dockworkers who would load the ship with onions also 
wrested themselves from sleep and began to emerge from their night caves. Some 
had slept inside their cars. Others had gone to nearby homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Longshorewoman Janet Ritza, 36, bolted into the wharfinger's office, rubbing 
her eyes and thirsty for coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "I need a strong and large cup," said Ritza, who already had come in twice 
only to find the ship delayed. "This is the down side of this job. You don't 
have a set schedule." 
</P>
<P>
 One of 30 longshorewomen at the port, she has worked the docks for 13 years. 
Although she has earned the men's respect, she still has to prove herself every 
day, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's OK, because it keeps me on my toes," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While Ritza headed toward the dock, a tugboat took Harvey to the open sea. 
</P>
<P>
 In the tugboat's churning wake, an aqua-green fluorescence flashed in the dim 
light -- the result of the summer emergence of a top-floating, warm-water 
algae. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am psyching myself," Harvey said in anticipation of his jump to the Jorgen 
Lauritzen. "This will be a good jump." 
</P>
<P>
 He would have to leap from the tugboat to a rope ladder that hung 30 feet down 
the ship's hull.  
</P>
<P>
 "The new ships have elevators," he said, "but with the old, you still have to 
get onto them the old-fashioned way."  
</P>
<P>
 As both the tugboat and the ship moved into position, the ocean swelled to 
five feet. But Harvey made a clean jump onto the moving ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most dangerous time for a pilot is boarding and disembarking," said the 
tugboat's captain, Jon Belchere. "The timing has to be just right." 
</P>
<P>
 In the darkness, Harvey climbed to the deck then piloted the 530-foot ship 
into the harbor. It tied up at 3:35 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Ritza and 20 other dockworkers took over. Driving forklifts, they loaded 
the onion pallets onto huge nets that lifted them into the ship's hold. They 
would load onions until their shift ended at 8 a.m., when the day crew would 
take over. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be a long day," Ritza said. "And when I'm done, I will go home and 
be a mom."

OFFICIALS TAKE SIDES ON WORTH OF PROP. 187; POLITICS: CONTROVERSY BUILDS OVER 
'SAVE OUR STATE' MEASURE THAT WOULD DENY MANY PUBLIC BENEFITS TO ILLEGAL 
IMMIGRANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors opposes it. So does the local chapter 
of the Mexican-American Bar Assn. and a countywide advisory panel to the public 
health department. 
</P>
<P>
 But so far, the true depth of feeling over the so-called "Save Our State" 
initiative has not been demonstrated locally. Stay tuned. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters and opponents of the Nov. 8 ballot measure -- which would deny 
schooling, non-emergency health care and other public benefits to illegal 
immigrants -- have spent the summer gearing up countywide campaigns aimed at 
winning over voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, less than three months before Election Day, both sides say they are set 
to go toe-to-toe over a proposition that holds the promise -- or the threat -- 
of further fueling the already fiery immigration debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law needs to be upheld and government should not act as a magnet for 
lawbreakers," said Steve Frank, coordinator of the Ventura County campaign in 
support of the measure. "If they can't get jobs and they can't get benefits, 
they will have to go back where they came from." 
</P>
<P>
 Polls show the initiative gathering widespread support among voters. And it 
could play a significant role this fall in at least one of the races for 
Ventura County's two congressional seats. 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, groups throughout Ventura County have launched a series of 
efforts aimed at reversing the public mood. Opponents say they hope to reveal 
the initiative for what they believe it is: a misguided measure that violates 
the California and U.S. constitutions, turns citizens into immigration agents 
and casts a shadow of suspicion on Latinos, Asians and other nonwhites. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very divisive initiative," said Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez, who on 
Tuesday will urge his fellow councilmen to adopt a resolution opposing the 
measure. "As time goes on, and people see it for what it really is, I think 
more and more agencies are going to take a position against it." 
</P>
<P>
 Its official name is Proposition 187. Supporters have dubbed it "Save Our 
State," or SOS for short. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would bar illegal immigrants from public education, 
non-emergency health services and other publicly funded programs. To accomplish 
this, teachers, police officers, social workers and health care providers would 
be enlisted to weed out illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the desire to limit public benefits to U.S. citizens or legal 
residents, supporters of the measure acknowledge that what they really want to 
do is reshape national immigration policy by forcing judicial review of court 
rulings that guarantee education and other services to the undocumented. 
</P>
<P>
 It is likely that even if voters pass the measure, major provisions of it will 
be tied up for years by protracted legal battles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a sad situation that it has to be done in the form of initiative 
because the federal government has not done its job in enforcing immigration 
law," said Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley), a Proposition 187 supporter and 
longtime advocate of tougher controls on illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I'll tell you," Gallegly added: "If it passes the way I think it's going 
to pass, it will send a very strong message to those in the Congress that the 
people of California can't take any more." 
</P>
<P>
 Many opponents of the initiative do not argue the need for some type of 
immigration reform. They simply question the wisdom of a measure that would 
deny education and health care to people who are unlikely to return to their 
homelands simply because they can no longer get public benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that it is unhealthy public policy," said Barbara Thorpe, chairwoman 
of the Ventura County Public Health Community Advisory Board. "We are not 
saying that illegal immigration isn't a problem. But what we are saying is that 
this is not the way to go about solving that problem." 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory board to county public health has officially opposed Proposition 
187. Thorpe points out that the initiative overlooks a simple public health 
concept: If the health of one segment of a community is allowed to decline, the 
health of the entire community is jeopardized. 
</P>
<P>
 Thorpe said she doesn't believe that illegal immigrants drain health services 
the way framers of Proposition 187 say they do. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see them as heavy users or, as this initiative would have you think, 
abusers of the system," she said. "They've picked the wrong crowd, I think." 
</P>
<P>
 In perhaps the most drastic provision of the initiative, school officials 
would be obligated to verify the legal status not only of students but of 
parents and guardians, even if their children are U.S. citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 This provision will probably trigger a court challenge and possibly a review 
of state and U.S. Supreme Court rulings that guarantee public schooling to 
illegal immigrant children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we need some discussion about whether or not it will, in the long 
run, benefit this county and this state to not provide education and public 
health services to children who are here," said Chuck Weis, Ventura County 
superintendent of schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern," Weis added, "is that this dialogue is really about trying to 
find a scapegoat for our economic problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the measure acknowledge that hard times have a lot to do with 
the creation of Proposition 187. But more to the point, they argue that illegal 
immigrants have overrun the state and that California simply has had enough. 
</P>
<P>
 So deep is public sentiment on the issue that it could have repercussions this 
fall in several political races, including the contest in the 24th 
Congressional District, which includes Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 In that race, Rep. Anthony Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) is being challenged by 
Calabasas Republican Richard Sybert, a former aide to Gov. Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are on record in support of legislation to curb illegal immigration. 
But Sybert supports Proposition 187 and Beilenson does not. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tony Beilenson has done a very good job of engaging in anti-illegal 
immigration rhetoric while at the same time doing absolutely nothing about it," 
Sybert said. "I certainly plan to make it (Proposition 187) an issue. On 
immigration, as with so many things, he says one thing here at home and he does 
another thing in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said his record in support of legislation to stem the tide of 
illegal immigration speaks for itself. But he said he believes that many of the 
provisions of the ballot measure will be ineffective, and that some are 
downright offensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem of illegal immigration is extremely serious and has to be dealt 
with in a substantive way," Beilenson said. "But if one truly cares about this 
issue . . . then you concentrate on the things that hold out some real promise 
of stopping illegal immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly, Ventura County's other congressman, said he thinks the practical 
effect of Proposition 187 will be to spur changes in immigration policy on 
Capitol Hill and the White House. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he believes measures he has long championed -- such as denial of 
citizenship to U.S.-born children of illegal immigrants and calling for 
counterfeit-resistant identification cards -- will gain widespread support 
because of the measure's passage. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've never heard me say that this is a panacea or a perfect initiative," 
Gallegly said. "What this is is a public expression of frustration that says 
we've got to do something about the problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the ballot measure say they fear that the practical effect of 
Proposition 187 will be to unfairly pin the state's economic woes on those who 
can't stick up for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "People look for easy answers and this is the easy way out," said Moorpark 
Councilman Bernardo Perez, president of the Latino advocacy group El Concilio 
del Condado de Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Perez will debate the issue with Steve Frank early next month. The two squared 
off in another debate last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern," Perez said, "is that Proposition 187, and the political rhetoric 
from both sides of the aisle, are getting us away from responsible and 
reasonable dialogue on immigration policy."

THOUSAND OAKS BUILDS ON CULTURE FOR FUTURE; ARTS: AT A CROSSROADS, CITY WORKS 
TO MESH CREATIVE PUSH FOR SEVERAL NEW MUSEUMS WITH THE DESIRE TO KEEP ITS 
SEMIRURAL AMBIENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Calling the expansion of cultural centers in Thousand Oaks a sign of 
self-reliance, residents and city leaders have started to look past the opening 
of the Civic Arts Plaza and forge ahead with plans for several new museums. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the backers of new centers for art, history and science are 
optimistic about their projects, city planners said balancing the public's 
desire for more cultural amenities with the wish to keep Thousand Oaks 
semirural will be tougher than ever. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is the most challenging time for Thousand Oaks," Councilwoman 
Jaime Zukowski said.  
</P>
<P>
 "This city drew people because it was an escape," she said. "But with the 
arrival of the civic center, I think there's a creative push which is taking 
the city in a new direction." 
</P>
<P>
 That new direction includes a flurry of activity to find a permanent home for 
the city art museum and to establish new Native American and children's science 
museums. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley Art Museum, which has displayed art in rental galleries for 
more than a decade, is now actively searching for a permanent location. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired of having its works hidden in a corner of the Janss Mall where there is 
little foot traffic, the museum's volunteer president said the time is right 
for a move. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have the performing arts in Thousand Oaks, so it's only 
natural that we have the visual arts," said Maria Dessornes, museum president. 
"That's what makes a city complete." 
</P>
<P>
 Dessornes said she envisions a museum with a strong permanent collection and 
rotating exhibits from around the world. Of course, she added, the museum's 
shoestring budget will require some creativity. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, a private collector has promised to donate his wealth of contemporary 
art once the museum has a permanent home. And Dessornes said rotating exhibits 
ranging from Ukrainian art to an exhibit of intricate dolls have proven popular 
and inexpensive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can make something work," she said, "because I think it's 
something that the city is ready for." 
</P>
<P>
 Another group, which grew out of a failed attempt to bring the Southwest 
Museum from Los Angeles to Thousand Oaks, is arguing that the city is also 
ready for a native peoples museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Councilman Frank Schillo, this effort involves the establishment of a 
museum that would tell the story of local Native American groups through talks, 
displays and interactive programs linking Thousand Oaks to the Smithsonian 
Institute in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Schillo said the group has narrowed its search to two locations -- one across 
from Oakbrook Park and another off Erbes Road -- that would be perfect for such 
a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I first moved out here, we had to get everyone in the car and 
spend a whole day just to go shopping," said Schillo, a 23-year Thousand Oaks 
resident. "Now we're talking about having a museum less than five minutes 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Attempts to bring a third museum, this one aimed at sparking children's 
interest in science through interactive exhibits, is also under way. A group, 
which has dubbed the new facility the Ventura County Discovery Center, has 
located a site and is obtaining nonprofit status. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members of the proposed science museum said they hope to team up with 
the city's large scientific community to help them create programs that get 
young people excited about science. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's plenty of focus here on athletics and soccer, but we are lacking in 
exposing our children to other areas," said Linda Parks, a board member and 
city planning commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of these museums would be great for the city, as long we are careful when 
we put them together," Parks said. While residents want these amenities, she 
said, they also want to ensure that the city protects the semirural atmosphere 
that drew residents here. 
</P>
<P>
 New cultural centers, in addition to the new two-theater Civic Arts Plaza, are 
sure to bring the added traffic, smog and other problems associated with an 
urban area. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city's recently completed survey of resident attitudes, the desire for 
an art museum and a children's museum finished 13th and 14th on a list of 27 
items needed in the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 First on the list was more public open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to always keep in mind when we're planning the future of the city 
that foremost on people's minds is the semirural atmosphere," City Planner 
Larry Marquart said. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary means of achieving that during a period of growth, Marquart said, 
has been to limit the size of buildings, keep the city's hilltops free from 
development and continue to purchase open space. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those things help, but the city is still growing," Marquart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several residents who submitted comments for the city's attitude survey 
complained that the rural feel has been lost. 
</P>
<P>
 And some, Zukowski said, grew so frustrated that they decided to leave the 
city for such places as Oregon or Idaho, where the lifestyle resembles that of 
Thousand Oaks' 20 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are those who have given up, but there are more who have not lost 
hope," Zukowski said. "I still think we can find a way to get these amenities 
and still maintain the remarkable beauty of this area." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can do that balancing act," she said, "we will be quite a city."

VALLEY BRIEFING: BEWARE OUT THERE; EXAMINING DANGERS IN THE GREAT OUTDOORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer is the season of sun and fun. But it's also the season for bee stings, 
poison oak and snake bites. 
</P>
<P>
 Each summer day, the Los Angeles County Regional Poison Control Center 
receives about 20 spider bite calls and 10 to 15 inquiries about bee and wasp 
stings. Once a week an inquiry is made about rattlesnakes. Last year, the 
center confirmed 20 black widow spider bites. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black widows don't walk across the floor or get in your bed," said Dr. Greg 
Thompson, the center's director. "You've got to reach into their area." 
</P>
<P>
 Other good news: Although many people believe the highly poisonous brown 
recluse spider lives in Southern California, it really doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule of thumb with poisonous critters is to be aware of your surroundings 
and learn to identify the creatures. If you leave them alone, they will 
generally leave you alone. But strange encounters do occur. Although most snake 
encounters happen outdoors, a Leona Valley man was seriously injured last month 
when he poked his head through a trapdoor in his attic and was bitten by a 
rattlesnake. Black Widow Spider 
</P>
<P>
 Latrodectus mactans  
</P>
<P>
 Female black widows are more aggressive and venomous than their male 
counterparts. The venom toxicity of the female is greatest in the warm months. 
</P>
<P>
 * Identification: Female black widows are nearly half an inch long, with the 
distinctive red hourglass pattern on the belly. Male black widows are slightly 
smaller, with red and white markings on the sides. Their young, which are also 
poisonous, are brown with pink markings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat: Sheltered dark places, such as brush piles, hollow stumps, 
outhouses and garages. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms of a bite: Muscle spasms and cramps within an hour of bite. Severe 
reactions include tingling and burning sensations, headache, dizziness, 
vomiting and difficulty breathing. Symptons usually dissipate within 48 hours. 
Bites are rarely fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treatment: Place ice bag on the wound and keep victim calm. Seek medical 
treatment. Honeybee 
</P>
<P>
 Apis mellifera  
</P>
<P>
 Walkers should avoid wearing bright colors when treading in bee territory and 
carry a bee-sting kit if allergic to them. Bees can only sting once, since they 
die afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 * Identification: Workers are up to half an inch long, with hairy, brownish 
thorax and orange and black banded abdomen. Queen is larger and rarely seen. 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat: Crop lands, orchards, gardens, fields, woodlands. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms of a sting: Pain and swelling with most people. Signs of an 
allergic reaction include excessive swelling, difficulty breathing and red 
lines running alongside of the sting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treatment: Remove stinger by scraping the area with a flat edge, such as a 
credit card or matchbook, wash area well and apply an ice pack. Those who are 
allergic should seek medical attention. Poison Oak 
</P>
<P>
 Toxicodendron diversilobum  
</P>
<P>
 And if crawly things and snakes aren't enough, there's poison oak. Those who 
venture into the back country should wear long sleeves and pants and learn how 
to identify this plant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Identification: Stands 4r to eight feet tall, though it grows like a vine, 
twining 15 to 20 feet up a tree trunk. Green leaves turn red in the fall. 
During the winter, plant has no leaves but is still poisonous. 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat: Moist, shaded areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms of contact: Red rash with blisters. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treatment: Wash area with strong soap and cold water within two hours of 
contact. Calamine lotion is among the over-the-counter products available to 
give relief. Seek medical attention if inflammation is excessive. Western 
Black-Legged Tick 
</P>
<P>
 Ixodes pacificus  
</P>
<P>
 Ticks found locally can transmit Lyme disease, which gets its name from Old 
Lyme, Conn., where it was first described in 1975. California reported 1,780 
Lyme disease cases to the Centers for Disease Control from 1984-93, the 
sixth-highest number in the country. People in the outdoors should wear 
light-colored clothing and regularly check themselves and their pets for ticks. 
</P>
<P>
 * Identification: Dull, reddish-brown body one-eighth-inch long with dark legs 
and prominent mouth parts. Most active from May to October. 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat: Shrubs, plant stems. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms of a bite: In case of Lyme disease, rash or lesion that develops a 
few days to a few weeks after a bite. Flu-like symptoms may also appear, 
including a stiff neck, chills, fever, sore throat, headaches, fatigue and 
joint pain. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treatment: Seek medical attention. If left alone, the symptoms may 
disappear, but worse problems like arthritis or meningitis may follow. Yellow 
Jacket 
</P>
<P>
 Vespula  
</P>
<P>
 One of the most aggressive and vicious stinging insects, yellow jackets can 
cruise at 12 m.p.h., about the speed of a honeybee. An estimated 15 to 20 
people die each year in the United States as a result of stings by wasps and 
bees. 
</P>
<P>
 * Identification: Workers are about a half-inch long with distinctive yellow 
and black banded abdomen and dark wings. (Some species marked by black and 
white.) Queens, most likely to be sighted in the early spring, are larger than 
workers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat: Paper nests constructed underground, although sometimes built in a 
hollow trunk, attic, thick bush or tree branches. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms of a sting: Pain, swelling with most people. Allergic reactions are 
same as a bee sting. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treatment: Same as a bee sting, however no stinger is left behind. Wasps can 
sting more than once. Southern Pacific Rattlesnake 
</P>
<P>
 Crotalus viridis helleri  
</P>
<P>
 April to October is snake season, when rattlers are most likely to be seen 
sunning themselves on a road or a rock. Hikers should wear boots when walking 
in tall grass. If you to see one, leave it alone. The Mojave green, found in 
the Antelope Valley, is considered among the world's most poisonous rattlers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Identification: Up to nearly 5 1/2 feet long, brownish blotches down the 
back, generally edged with dark brown or black, often surrounded by light 
border. 
</P>
<P>
 * Habitat: Holes in the ground, rocky crevices, also under bushes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Symptoms of a bite: Localized pain and swelling that may spread to a whole 
limb. Moderate bites bring nausea, vomiting and tingling. Serious bites may 
result in shock, coma, paralysis and death. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treatment: Splint bitten limb and keep victim calm. Do not suck out the 
venom. Call for medical help. Questions about poisonous animals, insects, 
spiders or plants?

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; HEAT LINKED TO DEATH OF MAN RIDING BIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The continuing high temperatures this weekend may have contributed to the 
death of a 51-year-old Thousand Oaks man, who died Saturday morning while 
bicycling at Point Mugu State Park, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Park officials said they suspect that Kenneth Bonebrite died of a heart attack 
brought on by the extreme heat.Pending an autopsy, however, no cause of death 
was given by the Ventura County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonebrite was riding fairly slowly down a steep hill near Sycamore Canyon 
about 10:45 a.m. when he went off the road and crashed into some brush, park 
ranger Simon Cavazos said. Bystanders rushed to help Bonebrite, who appeared to 
be having a heart attack, Cavazos said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When one of our rangers arrived, he was already in full cardiac arrest, but 
people were administering (cardiopulmonary resuscitation)," Cavazos said. "We 
don't know, but the heat appears to have been a factor." 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures at Point Mugu were hovering around 95 degrees when Bonebrite 
collapsed, Cavazos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonebrite was taken by sheriff's helicopter to Los Robles Regional Medical 
Center in Thousand Oaks, where he was pronounced dead, Cavazos said.  
</P>
<P>
 Warm weather prevailed across the county Saturday, but temperatures were 
slightly lower than on Friday, meteorologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 Temperatures reached a high of 100 degrees in Fillmore and Piru, and the 
mercury peaked at 99 in Simi Valley and 97 in Ojai, the county Air Pollution 
Control District reported. Temperatures on the coast stayed around 80. 
</P>
<P>
 The hot temperatures are expected to continue today as a high pressure system 
over Arizona stifles cooling onshore breezes, said Curtis Brack, a 
meteorologist from WeatherData Inc., which forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's really no relief in sight from these highs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county pollution control district predicted moderate to unhealthy air 
pollution conditions today. SCOTT HADLY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: VENTURA; BYSTANDERS COME TO AID OF ROBBERY VICTIM, 75

<P>
 Bystanders came to the rescue of a 75-year-old man who was robbed as he walked 
to church Saturday, capturing the teen-age suspect, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Donathan was walking on North Ventura Avenue around 11:30 a.m. on his way 
to the Avenue Community Church when the teen-ager ran up behind him and yanked 
Donathan's wallet out of his back pocket, said senior pastor Clifford Musgrove, 
who witnessed the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paul's just a little guy, and he couldn't really fight back," Musgrove said. 
"But everybody knows Paul around here and everybody loves him. Not two seconds 
later, three men went after that boy and caught him." 
</P>
<P>
 The men wrestled the youth to the ground and held him until police arrived, 
Musgrove said. Meanwhile, other witnesses picked up Donathan's wallet, which 
the youth had thrown under a car, and returned it to him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Donathan, a retired Ventura city employee who has a pacemaker, was shaken but 
unhurt, police said. SCOTT HADLY

OFFICER STABS SUSPECT DURING ARREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura police officer stabbed a suspect he was attempting to arrest when 
the man reached for the officer's service revolver early Saturday morning, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Christopher Davis, a four-year veteran, had chased the man, Benjamin 
Aragon, 33, from a Mobil gas station at 776 S. Seaward Ave., where Aragon had 
reportedly terrorized a woman locked in her car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 When officers arrived on the scene about 4:20 a.m., Aragon reportedly fled 
from the gas station and climbed onto the roof of a nearby building in the 2300 
block of Vista Del Mar Drive. Police and members of the Ventura Fire Department 
and the county Mental Health Crisis Team tried to coax Aragon down and into 
custody, the spokeswoman said. Instead of surrendering, Aragon swung down from 
the roof on a loose electrical cable and started running, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis followed on foot, trapping Aragon near a chain-link fence, police said. 
Aragon tried to fight his way free after refusing to be arrested, the 
spokeswoman said. As Davis struggled to restrain him, Aragon hit, bit, and 
tried to choke the officer, police said. Finally, Aragon tried to grab the 
officer's gun, and Davis pulled a knife and stabbed the suspect in the chest, 
authorities said.  
</P>
<P>
 Aragon was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder and taken to Ventura 
County Medical Center, where he was treated and was being held for observation, 
a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aragon had a previous outstanding warrant for resisting a prior arrest, police 
said.

OBITUARIES; WILLIAM GROSSBACH; ASSISTANT SCHOOLS CHIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William Grossbach, a former Ventura County assistant superintendent of 
schools, has died at age 72. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossbach served as county assistant superintendent for business services from 
1973 to 1987.During that time, he was a driving force in establishing 
self-funded insurance programs for all of Ventura County's 21 school districts, 
said James F. Cowan, who was a county superintendent of schools during 
Grossbach's tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1979 to 1987, Grossbach also served as the president of the Ventura 
County Schools Self-Funding Authority, a coalition made up of the county's 
public school districts. Through the self-funded insurance programs, the 
authority freed money for educational programs while still providing 
significant levels of coverage for workers compensation, liability and other 
forms of self-insurance, authority officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowan said county school districts shared resources under the self-funded 
insurance programs to lower their insurance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It enabled the schools to save considerable money in terms of their various 
insurance premiums, enabling that money to flow right into the classroom," 
Cowan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossbach, a native of Minnesota and a former resident of Ventura, was living 
in Sacramento at the time of his death.

QUAKE DOUBLES USE OF COMMUTER TRAINS, SURVEY FINDS; TRANSIT: MANY OF THE NEW 
RIDERS CITE DAMAGED FREEWAYS AS THEIR REASON FOR TAKING METROLINK. BUT WHITE 
MALE PROFESSIONALS ARE STILL MOST FREQUENT USERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY CHU, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California's commuter trains carry twice as many passengers now as 
before the Northridge earthquake, and the average rider is a well-heeled white 
male professional from the suburbs, according to results of a survey released 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of women and minority group riders increased only slightly, if at 
all, in the past year, the survey found. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly half the Metrolink system's 15,500 daily riders began taking the 
periwinkle and white trains after the January quake. Many of those new 
customers -- one-sixth of the current passengers -- identified quake damage to 
the freeways as the reason they ride Metrolink. 
</P>
<P>
 Metrolink passengers overall -- the majority of whom receive subsidies from 
their employers to take the train -- continue to report high satisfaction with 
the 2-year-old train service, although some complain of high fares, delays and 
poor connections at their destinations. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey results, based on a Metrolink poll of 4,527 riders in June, show 
little change in the typical passenger profile since a similar study last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some official attempts to diversify ridership, the trains still 
attract affluent white-collar workers -- mostly male executives and managers -- 
from households with an average annual income of $64,450. More than half (55%) 
receive subsidies from their employers to ride the trains. The subsidies 
average $58 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 The socioeconomic status of Metrolink customers continues to stand in stark 
contrast to that of the region's bus users, who are overwhelmingly members of 
ethnic minority groups with household incomes of less than $30,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 That disparity was recently brought into the debate over the decision to raise 
bus fares for the first time in six years. Metrolink officials slashed fares 
for several months as an earthquake-relief measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The surveyed riders gave Metrolink high marks for service, personal safety and 
professional courtesy from staff. They said they are under less stress because 
they no longer have to drive to work. Three out of five passengers surveyed had 
commuted alone by automobile. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, 75% of riders -- even those who live within five miles of their 
stations -- drive alone to the train station, which means they "cold start" 
their cars each workday morning. Cold starts are the single biggest contributor 
to air pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, which has a margin of error of less than 2 percentage points, 
found that: 
</P>
<P>
 * Nearly half of all passengers began using the system after the January 
earthquake. About 48% of these new customers identified the temblor as their 
reason for turning to the trains. They account for one-sixth of the current 
ridership. On the Santa Clarita line, three out of four passengers traced their 
ridership to the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 52% of riders are men -- the same proportion as last year -- while 48% of 
passengers are women, up from 45%. (In last year's survey, 3% of respondents 
did not specify whether they were male or female.) 
</P>
<P>
 * As was the case last year, whites make up two-thirds of those who ride the 
trains. The proportion is even higher along some routes, such as the Ventura 
line and the Santa Clarita line (74%). 
</P>
<P>
 * The percentage of African Americans using Metrolink rose to 9.4% this year 
from 7% last year. Latinos registered a tiny rise, from 13% to 13.1%. Asian 
American ridership dropped from 13% to 9.1%.

BOXING ROUNDUP; CHEAP SHOT LEAVES BOWE WITH A NO-CONTEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Riddick Bowe, the former heavyweight champion, returned to the ring in 
controversial fashion Saturday night, hitting a kneeling Buster Mathis Jr. with 
a right uppercut that left him unable to continue. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight was stopped at 2:11 of the fourth round and was declared a "no 
contest" amid a chorus of boos from a crowd of 3,200 in a ballroom at the 
Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Shaw, a member of the New Jersey State Athletic Control Board, said 
referee Arthur Mercante Sr. told the board he felt the punch was intentional. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Hazzard, the board's commissioner, said, "We knew Bowe was winning, but 
we felt we should not let Bowe win the fight because the referee said the blow 
was intentional." 
</P>
<P>
 "Disqualifying Bowe was an option, but in this particular case we didn't think 
he should be disqualified. We're not discounting it was intentional, but it 
happened in the heat of battle." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if he thought the controversy would affect Bowe's planned match against 
WBC champion Lennox Lewis, Rock Newman, Bowe's manager, laughed and said, "It 
makes it better." 
</P>
<P>
 While a Bowe-Lewis fight is signed, it has not received WBC sanction nor is 
there a date or site. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathis was taking punishment when he dropped to his right knee in the center 
of the ring in the fourth round. Bowe then delivered the right uppercut that 
put Mathis on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercante immediately halted the fight as Hazzard climbed into the ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the fight, Bowe went to Mathis and said, "You were down. I 
didn't know. I'm sorry." 
</P>
<P>
 "I went down on one knee," Mathis said. "I didn't know what he was going to 
do, but he came over and hit me up." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe explained that the much-shorter Mathis had been fighting in a crouch the 
whole fight. 
</P>
<P>
 It was certainly an attention-getting return for Bowe, 27, fighting for the 
first time since losing the IBF and WBA heavyweight titles in a rematch with 
Evander Holyfield last Nov. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the kind of attention a fighter wants. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-5 Bowe, who weighed 247 pounds, came out to finish Mathis, 6-0, 224 
1/4, at the opening bell. 
</P>
<P>
 He landed a couple of hard rights to the head in the first round, but was 
missing badly. In the second round, Bowe again landed some power punches to the 
head, but Mathis kept moving and landed a couple of left hooks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third round, Bowe got his powerful left jab working, and a big right to 
the head hurt Mathis with 20 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Mathis kept scrapping, however, and in the fourth round Bowe's left eye began 
to close. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, the fight was over and the controversy had begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Mercante, 75, also was the referee when Mathis' father, Buster Sr., was 
stopped in the 11th round by Joe Frazier in 1968. The elder Mathis trains his 
son, but does not travel to his fights because of health problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe's record remained 34-1 with 29 knockouts. Mathis, 24, from Grand Rapids, 
Mich., remains 14-0 with three knockouts. 
</P>

 Two-time world champion Lupe Pintor's comeback bid for a third crown stalled 
when he failed to come out for the ninth round against Puerto Rico's Leonardo

 Pintor (55-10-2), who previously held the WBC bantamweight and super 
bantamweight titles, lost his second consecutive fight since beginning his 
comeback earlier this year from an eight-year retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 The tone of what was to have been a 12-round bout was set in the opening 
round, when Mas (13-0) floored Pintor, of Mexico, with a left hook to the head. 
Pintor, 39, had trouble establishing any attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mas, 22, built his advantage, landing left leads with jabs or straight 
punches.

ROBIN ABCARIAN: A WARNING ABOUT THE DANGERS OF SELF-INVOLVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not everyone in Los Angeles will remember the Center for Feeling Therapy. But 
those who do may get a shiver when they hear about "Therapy Gone Mad," a book 
by Los Angeles writer Carol Mithers about the Hollywood therapy cult and 
community that had its roots in the pop psychology of the late '60s, flourished 
in the feelings-obsessed '70s, and crashed in the dawn of the money-mad '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Feeling Therapy left wrecked careers, relationships and lives 
in its wake. And, of course, multimillion-dollar lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 Mithers' book is a case study of how idealism goes sour, of the dangers of 
self-involvement, of how victims and predators will always find each other, and 
how people will tolerate only so much abuse before they rebel, even if 
rebellion comes too late to avert permanent degradation of the soul. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also a cautionary tale for the victim-oriented '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Mithers had firsthand experience with the Center for Feeling Therapy. Twenty 
years ago, she was about to graduate from UC Irvine when her boyfriend 
announced that he was joining a radical new psychology movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The boyfriend, she said, had taken classes about a new kind of therapy -- 
primal scream -- taught by an Irvine psychology professor named Joe Hart. When 
Hart announced that he was starting his own therapy center in Los Angeles -- 
the Center for Feeling Therapy -- with a graduate student named Richard (Riggs) 
Corriere and several other therapists, Mithers' boyfriend decided he had to be 
part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am learning how to feel," he wrote to Mithers. "It is exciting and 
difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, she moved to the neighborhood where the center's clients were 
renting and buying homes. Over time, about 350 young men and women would pass 
through about 40 houses scattered among 10 streets west of La Brea between 
Hollywood and Sunset. Another 600 or so received therapy at the center's 
out-patient clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she never became a patient, Mithers befriended many. She had no idea 
that brutalization was part of their "therapy." 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they were a bunch of sweet people engaged in a really sappy '70s 
pursuit and this endless talking about 'my feelings,' 'my this,' 'my that,' 
'I'm getting afraid,' 'I'm having thoughts.' It was just silly," Mithers said. 
What she didn't know was that on the night they went to "Group," they were 
beating each other up and being humiliated. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody talked about it. I think many, but not all, had a sense deep in their 
hearts that something really screwed up was going on." 
</P>
<P>
 In scores of TV and radio interviews throughout the '70s, Hart and Corriere 
promoted themselves as pioneers of a great new experimental psychotherapy, as 
"the Butch Cassidy and Sundance Kid of psychology," as "the new Freuds." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, a judge would later write, they were cult leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 On a late-summer morning in 1994, the neighborhood of original bungalows and 
Craftsman homes seems a throwback to an earlier time. 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling along the 1600 block of North Gardner, there is no hint that -- as 
the book and news reports detailed -- some of these homes were turned into a 
compound for the "founding therapists." No hint that patients were told who 
they could marry, that men and women were ordered to have sex with each other 
as part of their "therapy," that women were counseled to abort wanted children 
because they were not "sane" enough to have kids, that people were forced to 
strip or submit to beatings in "Group," or that they were made to take 
low-paying jobs with center-run companies that financially benefited the 
therapists. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the longtime neighbors, if you talk to them, can tell stories about 
the young, good looking men and women who walked around the neighborhood back 
in the '70s, yelling about their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors called them "the Screamers." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The crash came in late 1980 and could initially be blamed on that most '80s of 
motivations: money. 
</P>
<P>
 According to "Therapy Gone Mad," about a million dollars -- raised and donated 
by patients for a building fund -- had been appropriated by Corriere and spent 
to maintain a money-losing Arizona cattle ranch owned by the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money had been stolen," Mithers writes. "The fact hit like a sledgehammer to 
the skull. It was one thing that no one had ever reached the dreamy end point 
of sanity the therapists had promised. That goal had been vague and elusive, 
and failure to reach it was something a patient always could blame on him- or 
herself. But money was hard and absolute . . . and if the therapists had stolen 
money, they were not the good men they had always claimed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuits and license-revocation hearings lasted most of the decade and 
were covered extensively by The Times. Nearly 100 patients eventually settled 
for millions of dollars, paid by the center's insurance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, Mithers writes, an administrative law judge revoked the state 
psychology licenses of Hart, Corriere and others. In his decision, the judge 
said they had developed a "therapist centered" therapy in which they had 
"developed and enjoyed the seat of power in a cult . . . by any definition it 
was a cult." Hart and Corriere were found guilty of acts of gross negligence, 
incompetence, patient abuse, and aiding and abetting the unlicensed practice of 
psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of the center therapists would talk to Mithers for the book. One said the 
center was not his "reality" anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Patients with whom she spoke were promised anonymity. Some have gone on to 
professional and personal success and do not want it known they once belonged 
to a cult; some regard the experience as a positive one; some are very bitter. 
</P>
<P>
 A few are so damaged they have never recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 You finish the book half-wondering whether this kind of thing could happen 
again, half-knowing it will. This decade, after all, is increasingly infused 
with the notion that even the most evil deeds are excusable, that individual 
responsibility is becoming an outmoded concept, that everybody is a victim of 
something.  
</P>
<P>
 What fertile ground for exploitation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people are filled with fears and insecurity," Mithers said. "People like 
Joe Hart and Riggs Corriere could tap right into that." Their secret, she said, 
"was to make people feel loved and then threaten to take the love away. Under 
that dynamic, people will do anything. It is totally parental. It doesn't work 
on everybody, but if you have that kind of hole in you, you're gone."

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; FOREVER ON CALL; BY DAY, DR. SCOTT HITT TIRELESSLY -- AND 
WITH MUCH COMPASSION -- WAGES WAR AGAINST AIDS. BY NIGHT, HIS FOCUS TURNS TO 
WHAT HE CALLS THE LAST CIVIL RIGHTS STRUGGLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 T his is what it was like fighting for AIDS patients' lives during the 
Republican '80s:  
</P>
<P>
 The patient was weak, near death, losing precious body weight by the day. His 
doctor recommended an expensive intravenous-feeding treatment in hopes of 
kick-starting the man's immune system. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital refused. 
</P>
<P>
 "The attitude was 'This man's going to die, so let him die,' " Dr. Scott Hitt 
recalls. "I explained to the family that the procedure probably wouldn't have 
been any use. But I knew that the real reason was economic." 
</P>
<P>
 This is what it was like fighting for the attention of politicians back then:  
</P>
<P>
 A county official cornered Hitt and other gay activists at a public meeting to 
ask why an ACT UP member had spray-painted his office door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember telling him, 'You just don't get it, do you?' " says Hitt, who is 
not in ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power). "People are dying and you're 
not doing enough. Sure, you're spreading the word about the epidemic but you 
have to do more. Time is running out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Today, money and promises are a little easier to come by. But Hitt's AIDS 
patients are still dying. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time he enters his Beverly Hills clinic, he finds young men and women 
waiting in the tiny examination rooms, their expressions a bitter blend of 
fear, guarded hope and resignation as they confront some unbridled, 
otherworldly army. 
</P>
<P>
 At 35, Hitt has already seen hundreds die, many of them his friends. And so 
the faces that crowd his mind are more than just snapshots of a perplexing 
medical war -- they are images from a lost generation he has known and loved. 
</P>
<P>
 For six years, he has specialized in AIDS treatment as a partner in the 
Pacific Oaks Medical Group, one of the country's largest and most aggressive 
private health-care providers for HIV patients. Hitt sees more than 600 
HIV-positive men and women, and another 250 with full-blown AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Each night, with his healing efforts done, he starts a second life as a gay 
activist: staging fund-raising and strategy meetings at his Hollywood Hills 
home, speaking his mind to benefactors and politicians, clattering at the 
computer keyboard, working for "The Cause." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, AIDS activists say, Hitt is an influential cog in the local gay 
political machine and has recently become a serious contender for an 
appointment to the President's AIDS Commission, a policy-making advisory group. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, though, the doctor has learned that political activism can be a 
tightrope walk: He was accused in 1991 of violating a patient's privacy for 
political purposes, and the fallout endangered his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the encouragement of friends and supporters, he might have snuffed out 
his own activist fire. And the loss would have been profoundly felt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put Scott Hitt in the top 10 astounding figures I've known since working on 
national politics over 34 years," says David Mixner, a Los Angeles political 
consultant described by Newsweek as "the most powerful gay man in America." 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows what needs to be done. He's already doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eric, a studious-looking man with a shadow of shaved red hair, is struggling 
through the early days of AIDS, worried that a neck rash is a bad sign of 
things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had this zit on my chin that turned into a hideous thing," he says with a 
look of boyish revulsion. "The scab fell off and it's all weird. Now, it's 
moved to my neck." 
</P>
<P>
 As Hitt examines the rash, Eric continues in a stream of consciousness: "I'm 
stressed out, Doctor. I just feel like there's this gunk flowing through my 
blood. I can't sleep at night. I have these nightmares. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 And so it goes. Hitt listens to such stories a dozen times a day at his 
clinic. Sometimes, they turn out well. Eric's rash is not AIDS-related. And 
later in Hitt's office, where a poem by his lover hangs, the doctor revels in a 
patient's favorable test results: "Hey, that's great! That's good news! That's 
really good news!" 
</P>
<P>
 On rounds at the Immune Suppression Unit of Midway Hospital in Hollywood, 
where Hitt has worked in the past few years, the mood is more grave. The very 
worst cases lay in white-washed rooms -- anonymous save for a lover's 
photograph pinned to a wall -- men on the cusp of death. 
</P>
<P>
 For these patients, Hitt can only try to answer their questions, explain the 
newest treatments and offer heartfelt hope and good humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Because AIDS is a whole grab bag of conditions that may appear alone or in 
gangs, he often feels like a kid with one of those plastic fortune-telling 
eight balls. Turn it upside down and see which malady will strike next: 
pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, wasting syndrome, Kaposi's sarcoma. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Each day, there's a new mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 In one baffling case, a patient inexplicably lost his ability to speak 
coherently during a night out with friends, his thoughts suddenly pouring out 
in the garbled language of sickness. 
</P>
<P>
 CMV retinitis also ambushes the unsuspecting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had patients who didn't even know they carried the HIV, complaining 
innocently of some (spots) in their eyes," Hitt says. "I'll find that half of 
the back of their eye is inflamed. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, not only do I have to tell this person he's HIV positive, I have to break 
the news that he has full-blown AIDS. And that he is probably going to go 
blind." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such horrific moments, Hitt retains an unflagging optimism, debunking 
the notion that contracting HIV signals an imminent countdown to death. Some of 
his patients have been healthy for a decade or more. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pacific Oaks Medical Group, which also has an office in Sherman Oaks, has 
been described as "one-stop shopping" for HIV patients. It offers an array of 
on-site specialists -- from nutritionists to respiratory therapists -- as well 
as chemotherapy and radiology services. Physicians' assistants help the doctors 
monitor hospital patients and make house calls to the sickest shut-ins. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors elsewhere often look to Hitt and his colleagues for news of the latest 
medical options. 
</P>
<P>
 "This epidemic is new territory for all of us," Hitt says. "There are no 
guidebooks to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the clinic is seen as a model for managed care. 
</P>
<P>
 "A patient who comes to Pacific Oaks need look no further," says Dr. Howard 
Grossman, a New York physician who recently visited the clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're light-years ahead of the way other doctors are treating this 
disease." 
</P>
<P>
 Hitt's goal is to see AIDS tamed, as diabetes has been, into a disease whose 
symptoms are largely manageable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see patients with T-cells that are mildly depressed who say, 'Doctor, I'm 
going to die, aren't I?' And I always say, 'Where have you been living?' We are 
making strides in the treatment of AIDS," Hitt says. "The more progress we 
make, the safer it will be to say that those people just might be around long 
enough to see the cure." 
</P>
<P>
 That outlook inspires patients. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott is optimistic, but he's also a realist," says Doug Halter, a 
34-year-old computer software salesman from Ventura. "He tells things the way 
they are, but he also treats you as though you're going to live a long time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe the reason I'm still alive today is because of Scott," says 
Halter, who learned he had AIDS six years ago. "But if I don't make it through 
this epidemic, I know that he gave me the best shot I ever could have had." 
</P>
<P>
 The survivors of other patients share that feeling. Some have kept in touch 
long after losing their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was there for us -- always so straightforward and optimistic," says Tommie 
Lee, a Mississippi mother whose son, Barry, died in early May. 
</P>
<P>
 "His enthusiasm kept Barry optimistic. It's good to know Barry had Dr. Hitt 
because we were not there all the time. I'm so grateful for that doctor, for 
who he is and what he stands for, from the depths of my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 In his will, Barry Lee bequeathed a watercolor painting of his father and 
brother. "I would like the original painting of Dad and Chris in my hallway to 
be given to Doctor Scott Hitt," he wrote. "His care and compassion for the 
duration of my illness was profound. I would like him to know how much this 
meant to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So there he was, 15 years old, in the front passenger seat, giving wide-eyed 
directions to his blind father behind the wheel of a car weaving along Pacific 
Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 On this night, Bob Hitt had forced his son into service as chauffeur after his 
date became ill and fell asleep in the back seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scotty did all right," says his father, a retired stockbroker who lost his 
eyesight as a result of injuries suffered during a building collapse in the 
1971 Sylmar quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did some pretty crazy things. I shocked my boy sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 The son later returned the favor when his father asked him if he was gay. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was 23, just out of medical school," Bob Hitt says. "Scott said, 'I sure 
am.' I shook my head, got myself under control and we talked about it. I'm OK 
with it now." 
</P>
<P>
 He was on hand recently to watch Scott receive an award from an Oregon human 
rights committee for his work on gay issues. "I'm proud of my son. He's a hell 
of a guy. He's daring. And he's a good doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Scott Hitt grew up without his father in a Tucson 
mobile-home park. After his parents' divorce when he was 6, his mother 
remarried and had two daughters. Her only boy was a loner. 
</P>
<P>
 He remembers wincing when his grandmother, who lived in an adjacent trailer, 
would make bigoted comments about gays, about how they were destined to become 
mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 High school was a dual life of feigning interest in girls while knowing he was 
a homosexual. Early on, he thought about what obstacles he might face as a gay 
man. He could have become a lawyer but doubted his chances of landing a job at 
a top law firm. "As a doctor, I felt I could have my own practice. I knew there 
was a shortage of physicians and therefore, less discrimination." 
</P>
<P>
 At 20, he graduated from the University of Arizona -- a scholastic stint paid 
for in part by his father. During medical school on the same campus, he began 
frequenting the gay bar scene, where he met his partner, Alex Koleszar. 
</P>
<P>
 The two have been together 14 years, moving in the late '80s to Los Angeles 
for Hitt's residency. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, on a tour of the Sistine Chapel, Hitt turned suddenly to his 
lover and said, "Will you marry me?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer was yes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was so happy," recalls Koleszar, a painter and computer consultant. "It 
couldn't have been more romantic. I was waiting for the lightning bolt to 
strike." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A moneyed crowd is doing the social shake-and-bake at a recent Beverly Hills 
benefit for AIDS Project Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 As the three-piece band plays before the displays of Armani and Calvin Klein 
suits at Neiman Marcus, half a dozen male models with piercing eyes and pouty 
looks sashay along a makeshift runway. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience stands in silent rapture. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one man, however, with his back to the entertainment. Hitt is lost in 
conversation with James Loyce Jr., executive director of APLA. 
</P>
<P>
 A slender man with deeply set eyes, the doctor is as ubiquitous at such events 
as the miniature quiches -- leaning into the ear of some listener, showing the 
flag of political interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, keeping pace with him is like following some driven head of state. 
There are such functions as the annual Los Angeles Gay & Lesbian Pride 
Celebration; Hitt was among its official honorees this year. And he meets 
regularly with fellow members of APLA, the Gay and Lesbian Victory Fund and 
Access Now for Gay and Lesbian Equality (ANGLE). 
</P>
<P>
 ANGLE convenes monthly at the contemporary one-story house Hitt and Koleszar 
share in the Hollywood Hills. In a living room decorated with leather 
furniture, modern art and paintings by Koleszar, high-profile gay men and 
lesbians -- attorneys, aspiring politicians, business owners and movie people 
-- talk and laugh, gently ribbing each other. 
</P>
<P>
 When the meeting comes to order, matters turn serious, centering on spreading 
the activist spirit to college campuses and on the status of several political 
races. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitt sits at the center of the group and the conversation. He looks alert, 
despite having delivered a late-night speech the previous day at a political 
fund-raiser. In the weeks and months before that, he helped coordinate 
door-to-door campaign blitzes, fund-raising efforts, and he personally made 
vote-getting trips to Sacramento and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 During the last presidential campaign, Hitt's home was also the scene of 
informal round-table discussions between the local gay lobby and each 
Democratic candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Clinton, he says, represented hope. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1992 campaign speech at the Palace Hotel in Los Angeles, the 
then-Arkansas governor had proclaimed the gay and lesbian cause as one of basic 
human rights. Hitt and others had worked hard to sell $100 tickets to the 
event, meeting resistance from gays who viewed Clinton as a "redneck 
conservative Democrat." 
</P>
<P>
 The activists videotaped the speech and sent copies to gay groups nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The speech was the first time Clinton found a cause," Hitt says. "The next 
day's headline in the Washington Post read, 'Clinton Finds a Voice.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The gay community had found a voice as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last five years, local groups have raised more than $100 million for 
The Cause, activists say. And the Clinton Administration, Hitt says, has 
already spent more than $1 billion on AIDS research than its predecessor. 
</P>
<P>
 But there have also been disappointments, such as the President's compromise 
on gays in the military and his failure to overturn the ban on HIV-positive 
immigrants entering the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitt has no time for setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "AIDS is the Holocaust of our generation," he says. "Soon, the toll from the 
disease will exceed the number of Americans who have died in all of our wars 
combined. How many people in their 30s know a hundred friends who have died?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gays, he says, are waging the last civil rights struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are lots of evil people out there who . . . believe that AIDS is 
retribution for an evil lifestyle and that being gay is against nature's laws. 
There is so much discrimination. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, Hitt has learned some bitter lessons about mixing medicine and 
politics. 
</P>
<P>
 He became the focus in 1991 of a controversy surrounding doctor-patient 
confidentiality when he telephoned a colleague's patient -- a man sick with 
AIDS -- in hopes of eliciting support for Bob Burke, a candidate for the state 
Assembly from Silver Lake. 
</P>
<P>
 The patient accused Hitt of breaching medical ethics by using his influence to 
acquire the man's name for political purposes. Hitt acknowledges that the man's 
name was on a list of Silver Lake residents provided by a doctor friend. But he 
insists that he did not know the man was gay or had AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejecting an apology from Hitt, the patient appeared on TV's "Larry King Live" 
to air his grievances. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Board of Medical Quality Insurance investigated and eventually 
cleared Hitt of any wrongdoing, but the dispute nearly damaged his medical and 
political reputations, the doctor says. 
</P>
<P>
 When his patients called to ask for an explanation, Hitt was able to ease 
their concerns. Still, he was angry: How could his best intentions have gone so 
wrong? And was it all worth it? 
</P>
<P>
 "The question came up repeatedly, 'What are you doing this for?' and I asked 
myself, 'Well, why was I?' I tried my best to do good and somebody 
misinterpreted my efforts. I spent a week trying to decide if it was all worth 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends eager to keep him in the fight for gay rights ultimately made the 
difference. "They were convincing," he says. "They made me realize such things 
come with the turf." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In rare moments when Hitt isn't busy with medicine or politics, taking long 
drives in his new Mercedes 500SL convertible or romping with his yellow 
Labrador named Austin, he's throwing parties. 
</P>
<P>
 On an overcast Saturday in June, a string of beach balls bob over the pool and 
Jacuzzi for his fourth annual Gay Pride Pool Party. "Damn, I'm going to miss 
this year's party," an out-of-town gay activist had said days earlier about the 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Koleszar and Hitt play the perfect hosts, each entertaining different groups 
of guests, throwing each other the occasional glance. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple has come a long way since 1992, when Koleszar was struggling with a 
substance-abuse problem that surfaced, they both say, after the AIDS deaths of 
several close friends -- and at a time when Hitt was putting long hours into 
The Cause. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had let certain things take over my life," Hitt recalls. "That presidential 
campaign became my life, like a coach watching a football game. Only it was a 
lot longer. Each night, we'd watch news reports as if they were footage of the 
big game, seeing how the other side reacted to our play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just had this fantasy of Alex and I doing everything together. I pulled him 
into something that had become my dream. It took its toll." 
</P>
<P>
 Hitt eventually noticed that something was wrong. Koleszar was withdrawn, 
irritable, distracted. He was hooked on alcohol and sedatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "One night I just confronted him," Hitt recalls. "I said 'Alex, either you're 
having a nervous breakdown or it's drugs. It has to be one or the other.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Koleszar remembers that night as the most emotional of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "He asked me, 'What is it that I can do at this point?' " he says. "Scott told 
me that, for the first time in his life, he felt powerless." 
</P>
<P>
 But he did persuade Koleszar to get into a treatment program. And in a show of 
support, he curbed his own moderate drinking for several months and cut back on 
his political schedule. He stopped asking Koleszar to accompany him to every 
dinner and event. When he went alone, he came home by 9 p.m. Now, when Hitt 
manages political meetings at the house, Koleszar often slips off to an 
Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people see Scott as an enigma, as some sort of machine that goes 
nonstop, that's too afraid or doesn't know how to turn itself off," Koleszar 
says. "And Scott does keep his personal side close to his chest, even with his 
lover. Our relationship is going on 14 years now, and sometimes he's even 
guarded with me. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken me a long time to see certain sides of Scott. It's like he's 
almost afraid to stop at any point. Because if he did, and acknowledged the 
emotionally volatile issues around him, seeing his friends die on a daily 
basis, it would be too much for him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And so Hitt remains Out There, taking half a dozen red-eye trips to Washington 
each year to press the political flesh and always feeling guilty when a patient 
calls while he's away. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a doctor first and foremost, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hitt wants to keep his promise to be there for those who are estranged from 
their families and have survived their lovers, for those left to die alone. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a nightmare," he says, "that I want to prevent." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he cherishes the living-large moments, such as the night he and 
Koleszar attended a White House party thrown by the Clintons. Hand in hand, 
they walked through the East Gate, announcing themselves to the stern-faced 
Marines as "Mr. and Mr." 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in his home office, surrounded by pictures of himself and Koleszar 
with various politicians, Hitt stops briefly to point out his favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "That one," he says, pointing to a framed snapshot of himself and Koleszar 
together -- each smiling, arms wrapped around shoulders. "That one right 
there." Russell Scott Hitt 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 35. 
</P>
<P>
 Native?: No. Raised in Tucson, lives in Hollywood Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: His partner for 13 years, Alex Koleszar. 
</P>
<P>
 Passion: Fighting AIDS, as a physician and an activist. 
</P>
<P>
 On the challenge of treating AIDS patients: "This epidemic is new territory 
for all of us. There are no guidebooks to follow." 
</P>
<P>
 On the mounting loss of life: "Soon, the toll from the disease will exceed the 
number of Americans who have died in all of our wars combined. How many people 
in their 30s know a hundred friends who have died?" 
</P>
<P>
 On succumbing to demands of politics: "That (1992) presidential campaign 
became my life, like a coach watching a football game. Only it was a lot 
longer. Each night, we'd watch news reports as if they were footage of the big 
game, seeing how the other side reacted to our play."

GALLERY: OVER AND UNDER

<P>
 The wall -- 10 feet high and 14 miles long -- went up a year ago along the 
U.S.-Mexico border to stem the flow of illegal drugs and immig rants. And 
officials say it works. 
</P>
<P>
 The average number of "drive- throughs" by smugglers crashing the old cyclone 
fence with truckloads of drugs and immigrants has dropped from "200 to 300 a 
month before the wall to virtually none now," U.S. Border Patrol spokeswoman 
Ann Summers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Plus, border patrol apprehensions of illegal immigrants trying to slip into 
the United States are down 15% since last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But what can't be stemmed is the desire to seek a better life. So the 
immigrants keep coming. Some circumvent this barrier that stretches to the 
ocean; others may be heading to the border in Arizona, which has seen an 
increase in apprehensions. 
</P>
<P>
 And the wall is no monument to goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Tijuanans see the gray, rusting wall as a visual insult, a reminder of 
the harsh differences in how the two nations perceive each other, of the 
friction over the immigration issue. 
</P>
<P>
 With the newly added row of floodlights that run nearly the entire length of 
the fence, the wall resembles the edge of prison camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Javier Barros Valero, Mexico's foreign ministry undersecretary, understatedly 
described the fence as "not an act of friendliness or neighborliness." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Border Patrol is continuing with plans to build similar 
fences in Tucson and El Paso. After all, this one was a bargain -- a mere 
$482,000. 
</P>
<P>
 It was made entirely with several hundred tons of "landing mat": obsolete 
steel planks dating from the Vietnam era that were used for Army and Navy 
airstrips and roadways. 
</P>
<P>
 Labor was provided by Navy Seabees and Army Reserve welders who built the 
fence as a training exercise. CHRIS KRAUL

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP ALL NIGHT: WINGING IT; DC3, THE SANTA MONICA AIRPORT 
RESTAURANT, HAS A LITTLE OF EVERYTHING. JET ON OVER FOR A JAZZ COMBO, BALCONY 
DINING AND CHILD CARE. 
</P>

<P>
 The view is terrific. 
</P>
<P>
 The jazz group jams. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambient lighting makes everyone look good. 
</P>
<P>
 The collection of contemporary art is well-chosen and inspired, occupying a 
cavernous postmodern space that is a cross between a tasteful living room and a 
museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The salmon in Dijon cream sauce is divine, and the kids, if you've got 'em, 
are somewhere else out of earshot, being entertained and fed on the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Not bad, one might say, for an airport restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 DC3, the restaurant and jazz bar at the Santa Monica Airport, is something of 
an all-purpose evening spot. 
</P>
<P>
 The balcony overlooking the runway would be a perfectly reasonable place to 
propose marriage, especially around sunset, when the planes are taking off into 
the sunset through wispy clouds and the strains of the Dialect Quartet are 
wafting out on the evening air. 
</P>
<P>
 And it would be just as good a place to go with the kids a few years later, 
for a whine-free dining experience. 
</P>
<P>
 All this for about what you'd pay for a bottle of Inglenook Chablis and a 
piece of leathery veal in canned marinara just down the road at Los Angeles 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Every Tuesday through Thursday from 6 to 9 p.m. DC3 offers free supervised 
child care and a three-course prix fixe meal for parents who are undoubtedly 
too frazzled to order for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 The children are plied with pizza and Caesar salad, then given a tour of the 
adjacent Museum of Flying, including a ride in a simulator that will take them 
flying, surfing and downhill skiing. 
</P>
<P>
 Any munchkin out of diapers is welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 Make it Wednesday or Thursday, and you'll be entertained by the Dialect 
Quartet, featuring Jon Whinney, Paul Astin, Chris Wilson and a host of regular 
guest musicians for variety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Finding the band was kind of the story of 'Goldilocks and the Three Bears,' " 
says Jim Ryan, assistant general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "The acoustics here are kind of tricky. The first band was too loud, the 
second played too soft, and the third -- the Dialect -- was just right." 
</P>
<P>
 The band starts up at 5:30 p.m. for what may be the best happy hour in town, 
running from 4 to 7 and featuring complimentary hors d'oeuvres and pizza made 
to order from a special menu. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's real food," Ryan explains, "served at your table by a real waiter." 
</P>
<P>
 For those whose tastes and budgets favor the unreal, there is the Saturday 
night Helicopter Tour and dinner package. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Where: DC3, 2800 Donald Douglas Loop N., Santa Monica (hidden just off 28th 
Street south of Ocean Park Boulevard); (310) 399-2323. 
</P>
<P>
 When: Jazz every Wednesday through Friday, 5:30-9:30 p.m.; Saturdays until 11 
p.m. Free child care Tuesday through Thursday, 6-9 p.m. Happy hour 4-7 p.m. 
</P>

 Cost: Prix Fixe dinner $19.95. Drinks $4. Helicopter packages from $125 per 
person.

RSVP / THE SOCIAL CITY: COUNTY MUSEUM PLANS TO WHET L.A.'S PALATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Which one? That's what everyone is asking themselves about "The Art of the 
Palate," the Los Angeles County Museum of Art's first collaboration by its 11 
volunteer councils. 
</P>
<P>
 Patterned after the New York Public Library's biennial "Table of Contents" 
fund-raiser, the Los Angeles benefit Sept. 29 and 30 will present 46 dinners. 
Patrons send checks of either $500 or $150 and prioritize the six dinners 
they'd most like to attend. Then it's wait and see. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Irresistible Choices: From Chantilly, France, trustee liaison Dona Kendall, 
and from chilly Big Bear, chairman Jann McCord are providing irresistible 
parties. It's such a good cause -- a goal of $300,000 to reopen the museum on 
Tuesdays after county cutbacks. Among hosts: Bill (museum chairman) and Tally 
Mingst and Herb and Beverly Gelfand, planning a progressive dinner with Eskimo 
art at the Mingsts and American art at the Gelfands; Dona and Dwight Kendall, a 
dinner concocted by chef Joachim Splichal with Anjelica Huston and Robert 
Graham the guests. Hannah and former museum chairman Ed Carter will show off 
their Dutch art at a seated dinner for 12; trustee Terry and Lionel Bell will 
exhibit their African art at another sit-down. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More Hard Choices: Consul General of Japan Seiichiro Noboru and his wife, 
Yoko, will open their Hancock Park residence for a feast; Margie and Bob 
Petersen will entertain in the penthouse of the new Petersen Automotive Museum; 
Jacque and Robert Heeber will incorporate their amethyst geodes with gilded 
autumn leaves for a razzle-dazzle party hosted at the Westwood Marquis with 
general manager John Strozdas; Mumsey Neimiroff will stage a Gatsby evening 
slicked up with artists such as Laddie John Dill; Hutton and Ruth Wilkinson 
plan an East Asia soiree with designer icon Tony Duquette; Ed and Ruth Shannon 
will accept 36 to meet former President Gerald Ford and Mrs. Ford; Universal 
Studios will introduce guests to those who worked with Alfred Hitchcock. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Honorary Chairs: Lending enthusiasm -- honorary chairs Robert Altman, Anjelica 
Huston and Steve Martin. Wolfgang Puck and Splichal are culinary advisers, and 
tastemaker Paige Rense, honorary adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nonagenarian Gala: The 90th anniversary of the Children's Bureau of Los 
Angeles on Sept. 27 is a gala in the offing. Just recovered from pneumonia, 
Mary Marshall will transform the Regent Beverly Wilshire grand ballroom into a 
New Orleans panorama with gazebos. Co-chairs Connie Gavin and Shel Ausma plan 
for 800 to say farewell to Lod Cook, who is retiring as Arco CEO (but staying 
as chairman). His wife, Carole, will be there. Five Presidents have been 
invited, and the Bushes, the Reagans and the Fords are expected to attend. 
Party polishers, too: Carolyn Singleton, Betty Williams, Onnalee Doheny, Betty 
Wilson and daughter Marcia Hobbs, Jenny Jones and Nanci Denny. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Missing No Beats: Those Vista Del Mar leaders Suzanne Sidy, Elaine Wolf and 
Laura Fuhrman miss no beats. Already they're booked for a major January opening 
of "Miss Saigon" at the Ahmanson Theater. Elsewhere on the Social Circuit 
</P>
<P>
 * Ebullient Elaine Adams will chair the Festival of the Autumn Moon gala Oct. 
8 for Pacific Asia Museum. Trustees fete patrons at a reception Sept. 8 at the 
home of Drs. Edgardo and Lucy Arcinue in Pasadena. Patrons co-chairs: Marilyn 
Brumder, Nancy Neal Davis and Georgianna Erskine. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thinking big -- the Wolfgang Puck Charitable Foundation. It expects to make 
a record-breaking $400,000 (a cumulative of $2.4 million over the past 12 
years) with its American Wine and Food Festival Sept. 24. Sixty renowned 
winemakers and 24 of America's acclaimed chefs will be featured on the back lot 
at Universal Studios. Indulgers will raise funds for Meals-on-Wheels to deliver 
hot meals to the homebound elderly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Circle in Red: Sept. 30 for the Museum of Flying's salute to aviation headed 
by Dallas Price (we left out the date last week!) . . . The Peninsula Committee 
of Childrens Hospital Los Angeles' 37th annual A-rated Portuguese Bend National 
Horse Show Sept. 9 at Ernie Howlett Park in Rolling Hills . . . The autumn 
harvest-inspired Planned Parenthood of Pasadena dinner dance Oct. 1 with a goal

HOT PROPERTY: COTTAGE FIT FOR A KINGSLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 BEN KINGSLEY, who co-stars with Sigourney Weaver in the upcoming psychological 
thriller "Death and the Maiden," has leased a Beverly Hills-area home on nearly 
five acres for three months. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oscar-winning actor is in town to work with Forest Whitaker and Michael 
Madsen on the MGM sci-fi action-thriller "Species," which begins shooting on 
Monday. "Death and the Maiden," shot in France and Spain last spring, is 
expected to be released in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsley, 50, lives primarily in his native England, where he was an 
accomplished stage performer with the Royal Shakespeare Company before he won a 
best actor Academy Award with his first major film performance, the title role 
in "Gandhi" (1982). 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, he has appeared in a number of films, including "Bugsy" (1992), 
playing gangster Meyer Lansky, and "Schindler's List" (1993), as Schindler's 
Jewish accountant. Kingsley also played Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal in an HBO 
movie (1988). 
</P>
<P>
 Kingsley leased a three-bedroom home for a bit more than $8,000 a month, 
sources say. The home, described as "a 2,000-square-foot cottage," has detached 
guest quarters and a sunny pool area. It is situated on a promontory with 
canyon views. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Robinson of Rodeo Realty, Beverly Hills, represented Kingsley, and 
Elaine Young and Paul Czako of Coldwell Banker Residential Real Estate, Beverly 
Hills, represented the lessor. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A Malibu home once owned by businessman-turned-art collector NORTON SIMON, who 
died last year, and his wife, actress Jennifer Jones, has come on the market at 
$8.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally built in the 1950s, the residence was also owned at one time by 
director John Frankenheimer ("Birdman of Alcatraz," "52 Pick-Up"). 
</P>
<P>
 Beverly Hills real estate broker Stan Herman has owned the home, with its 100 
feet of Carbon Beach frontage, for the past four years. During that time, 
Herman totally remodeled it. 
</P>
<P>
 The home has five bedrooms in about 5,500 square feet plus an 80-foot-long 
swimming pool, 19-foot-high living room ceiling and a beach-facing wall of 
glass, which opens hydraulically. 
</P>
<P>
 Herman decided to sell the home to move to Montecito, where he plans to open a 
satellite office. He also listed the house next door to his Malibu home at $2 
million, including 50 feet of beach frontage. That house, which Herman also 
owns, could be used for staff, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 PATRICK LEONARD -- a songwriter and keyboard player famous as a favorite 
writing/producing collaborator with Madonna and Bryan Ferry -- and his wife, 
Susan, have sold their Flintridge home for nearly its $2.1-million asking price 
and moved to a ranch they bought in Colorado, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard, who also has worked with Rod Stewart and others, won a BMI award for 
his movie score "No Way Out." 
</P>
<P>
 The Flintridge home, which has four bedrooms in 5,000 square feet and a guest 
house, was sold to the first person who looked at it and represents the highest 
priced home sale to date in La Canada Flintridge, according to listing agent 
John Tartaglione, Douglas Properties director with Jon Douglas Co.'s Pasadena 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 The buyer was described as a businessman who is relocating from Northern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Lakers forward-center JACK HALEY, now with the San Antonio Spurs, and 
his wife, Stacey, a model and actress, have purchased a Westwood townhouse, 
where they will live off-season while he is training at UCLA, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Haley, a Southern California surfer who was on the Bruins' team for three 
years but never played high school basketball, was in the NBA for the Chicago 
Bulls, the New York Nets and the Lakers before he joined Magic Johnson's 
All-Star squad in a series of exhibition games. A veteran free agent, Haley 
signed with the Spurs last December. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haleys purchased a newly built, three-level townhouse for $385,000, after 
an escrow period of only five days, sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haleys were represented in the purchase by Alex Olmedo Jr., whose father 
led the United States to victory over Australia in the Davis Cup matches of 
1958 and who won the U.S. indoor and Wimbledon championships in 1959. Olmedo 
Jr. is with Jon Douglas Co., Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. architect CORKY KORKOWSKI, who has owned the Northern California town of 
Dinsmore since 1972, has put it on the market at $1.75 million. When he first 
listed the town in 1992, he was asking $3.75 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The recession prompted him to take the town off the market for awhile, but 
Korkowski, a grandfather in his 60s, is now living in Los Angeles to be closer 
to his children, who grew up in Dinsmore fishing for salmon and hiking through 
the hillsides. 
</P>
<P>
 The town, which is in Humboldt County about 290 miles north of San Francisco, 
has five miles of river frontage and is a gateway to a national forest. It also 
has a 10-bedroom lodge and conference center, horse-training facilities, three 
houses, 13 cabins and 21 mobile home/RV spaces. Bernice Gershon of Coldwell 
Banker, Beverly Hills, has the listing.

YOUR MORTGAGE; DISCLOSURE ON CREDIT RATINGS GETS FTC PUSH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH R. HARNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Trade Commission is on the verge of giving borrowers -- including 
all home mortgage applicants -- a major new tool for understanding how lenders 
evaluate them as potential credit risks. 
</P>
<P>
 In mid-August, the FTC plans to begin shaping final ground rules requiring for 
the first time that credit reporting agencies disclose and explain all your 
"credit scores" -- the little-understood but highly influential rankings that 
frequently determine whether you get a loan or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Credit scores are gaining special importance in the home mortgage field 
because lenders are shifting rapidly to electronic underwriting. Mortgage loan 
officers taking your application can now access not only your credit history 
files in a matter of seconds, but can also obtain credit scores evaluating your 
likelihood of default, bankruptcy, foreclosure or other risk categories. 
</P>
<P>
 Scoring programs take varying forms but generally are based on 
interrelationships among select bits of data contained in your credit files at 
the big three financial information repositories -- TRW, Equifax and 
TransUnion. The data scrutinized aren't always what you might guess. Not only 
might a score reflect how many times you paid late on a credit card, for 
example, but how many open lines of credit you have at a given time. Or how big 
a down payment you made on your last home purchase. 
</P>
<P>
 Using sophisticated statistical models, credit score programs assign numerical 
weights to certain pieces of information in your file. The resulting total is 
your score for that program -- a number that typically ranges somewhere between 
zero and 1,000. 
</P>
<P>
 How high or low you score isn't necessarily the key to a loan decision. One 
lender may consider a score of 550 to be a perfectly acceptable risk. To a 
lender down the street, on the other hand, it may portend future repayment 
troubles. 
</P>
<P>
 Complicating scores even further is the fact that they are dynamic. They 
change as the data in your credit files change. Your credit score in January -- 
based on 1993 reports from your creditors -- may be substantially different 
from your score this June. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the FTC wants credit reporting agencies to reveal not only raw 
scores to any consumer who requests them, but to provide intelligible 
explanations of what the scores mean and how they may be used. 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent proposal to the credit reporting industry, the FTC said it wants 
agencies to provide consumers with "each type of risk score" they have provided 
to lenders in the last six months or during the last two years for 
employment-related credit checks. The scores should be current -- calculated at 
the time of the consumer's request to the agency for disclosure -- and should 
be accompanied by a brief statement that explains "how the score may be applied 
by the user, and how the consumer ranks against other consumers under the 
scoring model." 
</P>
<P>
 Typically you'd get your scores and rankings along with a copy of your current 
credit report. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is for people to get as full and as relevant a disclosure as 
possible" about what creditors are obtaining on them from commercial credit 
reporting agencies, said Ed Mierzwinski, consumer program director for the U.S 
Public Interest Research Group, which has urged the FTC to mandate credit score 
disclosures. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current FTC policies, mortgage applicants who get rejected because of 
sub-par credit scores "often have no idea about it," said Mierzwinski, "and 
they have no access to the scores themselves or how they're interpreted" by the 
lender who said no. 
</P>
<P>
 By examining one or more credit scores, home loan applicants "will see where 
they fell short (in the lender's eyes)," according to Mierzwinski, "and can 
then either correct that -- if there's some factual error -- or can work on the 
problem and correct it." 
</P>
<P>
 If, for example, a borrower learns he's getting poor scores because his 
monthly credit card balances are seen as ominously high, he may be able to pay 
some of them off and improve his rating. Without scores and explanations, he 
might never comprehend that despite a solid monthly income, his debt level is 
setting off alarm bells inside an electronic underwriting program. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the main trade group representing the credit industry -- 
Washington-based Associated Credit Bureaus -- has not formally responded to the 
FTC's new proposals, a spokesman indicates the industry will likely go along 
with the broad thrust of expanded disclosures to consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot for you? Sometime in the coming months it's highly likely you'll 
probably get your first opportunity to see yourself as your mortgage lender 
does: Not only through your credit report but your competitive risk score -- 
ranked against thousands of unseen fellow borrowers.

AT HOME: BEING ON WATERWAY IS LIKE LIVING OUTDOORS; VENICE CANALS: SECLUDED 
ISLAND-LIKE LIVING ALONG COMMUNITY'S SIX CANALS IS ONLY MINUTES AWAY FROM 
CONGESTED VENICE STREETS.

<P>
 When Venice Canals resident Luis Rivas steps into his garlanded gondola, 
families of geese and ducks accompany him on a cruise along the tranquil 
waterways that border his backyard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Living in Venice Canals is like living outdoors," Rivas said. "This is one of 
the last spots in Los Angeles where you are in touch with nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Although just a few minutes east of Venice's crowded boardwalks, the 
community's six canals (Grand and Eastern canals run north-south; Carroll, 
Linnie, Howland and Sherman stretch east-west) are a serene sanctuary. 
</P>
<P>
 Accessible by car on just one road, Venice Canals offers secluded island-like 
living away from congested streets and traffic noise. The community features 
turn-of-the-century cottages with offbeat gardens of herbs and palm trees, 
pallazo-style villas and stylish contemporary homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivas, 53, and partner Lynn Miller, 55, moved to Venice Canals with their two 
dogs, Chelsea and Bubbles, in July, 1992. Rivas, an employment benefits broker, 
and Miller, a travel agent, sold their homes in Encino and Culver City, looked 
for a place with character close to the ocean and found their dream house in 
Venice Canals. 
</P>
<P>
 They paid $660,000 for a three-bedroom contemporary home. The peach-colored 
house was built in 1977 at the junction of Eastern and Howland canals. "I fell 
in love with it immediately. The view over the canals is breathtaking," Miller 
said. "We spend most of our evenings out on the deck enjoying the stunning 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Venice Canals is a small neighborhood of 351 homes. It is bounded by South 
Venice Boulevard on the north, by Washington Street on the south, by Ocean 
Avenue on the east and Pacific Avenue on the west. The 1,200 residents of the 
middle- to upper-middle class community are primarily Anglo, with Latinos as 
the second largest group. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is best known for its two miles of inland waterways accentuated by 
picturesque bridges that make it a favorite tourist attraction. In June, 1993, 
the community made the news when animal lovers unsuccessfully tried to prevent 
state wildlife officials from killing Venice ducks infected with a deadly 
virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Ducks have been part of Venice's charm since 1905 when tobacco tycoon Abbot 
Kinney recreated the idyllic waterways of Italy's ancient city of canals on 
what was then a tract of swamp and sand. Kinney, a broadly educated 
romanticist, envisioned the beach community as starting point of an American 
Renaissance that would begin on Californian shores. 
</P>
<P>
 The once-worthless salt marshes, drained by 40-foot-wide, 5-foot-deep canals, 
featured column-lined arcaded streets, luxury hotels, upscale shops and 
lavishly decorated restaurants. Even before the official opening of Kinney's 
Venice of America in 1905, most of the 592 residential lots had sold for as 
much as $2,700 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Some eight decades later, in 1985, Connie Blackwell paid $150,000 for a 
30-foot-by-95-foot lot at the junction of Eastern and Howland canals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew immediately that Venice Canals was the perfect neighborhood for me. 
The moment you get into the community, it feels like the countryside," 
Blackwell said. "At the same time you are close to beach and airport." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years and $250,000 later, Blackwell, 46, moved into her 3,500-square-foot 
dream house. "I wanted to create a real homey atmosphere, especially for the 
kids I planned to adopt," the owner of a school for insurance agents said. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Blackwell's daughters Katie, 6, and Molly, 5, whom she saved from a 
Romanian orphanage in 1991, roam her house. They leave the quaintness of the 
community only for school, (both attend the private Waldorf School in Santa 
Monica and for such necessities as trips to the mall or visits with friends.) 
"With the water and the wildlife, Venice Canals is a wonderful place for my 
girls to grow up in," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the community often point to Blackwell's unique home as one of the 
canals' architectural highlights. It features such rarities as wooden 
ornaments, antique stained glass windows and a pre-Civil War fence from New 
Orleans, all collected from salvage yards in Louisiana by Blackwell. 
</P>
<P>
 The famed canals have long attracted people searching for a life off the 
beaten path. "Every house has a different feel to it," said Gail England, 
realtor with Jon Douglas Co. "Most people who buy here choose the location 
first and the house second." 
</P>
<P>
 Home prices range from $300,000 for a charming 750- square-foot Craftsman 
bungalow from the 1920s to $850,000 for a sun-splashed contemporary villa with 
prime island location. An average single-family home sells for about $500,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the diversity in architectural styles attracts people from all walks 
of life, Venice Canals residents share the preservation of their lifestyle as a 
common goal. 
</P>
<P>
 After most of Kinney's original canals were filled in 1929, the remaining 
canals deteriorated. Crumbling sidewalks, rotten footbridges and algae-green 
water caused the city to close the canals to the public in 1942. 
</P>
<P>
 After 50 years of fighting between residents and city officials and 18 months 
of restoration, the Venice Canals area was reopened in October, 1993. With 
residents' input and labor, the $6-million overhaul replaced sidewalks and 
bridges, lined the canal walls with concrete blocks and removed tons of junk 
from the canals' bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an amazingly conscientious community," said Maxine Leral, who is a 
member of the Venice Canals Assn. "We were involved in the restoration from day 
one, proposed concrete blocks for the canal banks and planted wetland 
vegetation." 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a year Venice Canals residents join together for a workday to clean 
their beloved bridges of graffiti, a continuing problem in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 As for other crime problems, Officer Lori Taylor of the Los Angeles Police 
Department said: "It's still Venice, but the crime rate in the Canals is 
relatively low in comparison to the surrounding neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Leral, 55, and her husband, Murray, 63, bought a lot on Grand Canal in 1959 as 
an investment for $5,000. The original plan to sell the lot was soon thrown 
overboard when they fell in love with the romantic ambience of the Canals. 
Murray, a builder, started designing their home, and in 1979 they moved into 
the 1,800-square-foot Spanish-style home with big windows. "We wanted to let 
the outside in," said Leral. "We wanted to be as close to nature as you can 
possibly be." 
</P>
<P>
 The community's picturesque scenery was discovered as movie settings early on. 
For silent pictures, Harold Lloyd leaped from canal bridges and Mary Pickford 
was rowed down Grand Canal. More recently, the arched bridges served as 
background for television series such as "Simon & Simon" and "Baywatch." 
</P>
<P>
 Venice Canals is also a source of inspiration for singer Ann White, who paid 
$32,500 for a 1,200-square-foot Hansel and Gretel-style home on Howland Canal 
in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 "After my house in Beverly Glen Canyon had burnt down I wanted something close 
to the water," White said. "When the broker showed me the house, I bought it on 
the spot." White is a former member of the folk group the New Christy Minstrels 
who works as background singer for Burt Bacharach and recently sang on the 
soundtrack for Oliver Stone's moviec"Heaven and Earth." 
</P>
<P>
 When White, 55, and husband Michel DeMers, 50, a writer, remodeled their 
two-story home in 1990, they added 600 square feet of floor space and larger 
windows but kept the fairy tale aura intact. "We changed windows and walls but 
not the character. This is here to stay," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 The same is true for Anita Henkens, 69. She's lived in Venice Canals since 
1948, when she and her husband, Robert, moved into a one-bedroom, $10-a-month 
apartment on Carroll Canal. For her 10th wedding anniversary Henkens' father, 
who owned the one-story 1924 building, gave her the keys to the two adjacent 
units. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tore down walls, demolished two kitchens and walled up doors," Henkens 
said, to create a long, narrow Craftsman bungalow. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Henkens' home, the community also has undergone massive changes. "First 
came the beatniks, then the hippies, then the flower children and today it's 
the yuppies," said Henkens. "Venice Canals and I, we have seen some rough 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 "Venice Canals is not like anywhere else. Nobody tells you what to do, but at 
the same time we are a close-knit community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't even imagine living anywhere else. After all those years I still love 
it here." At a Glance

ASK THE INDOOR GARDENER; TRY IVY BETTER SUITED TO LIFE IN POT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOEL RAPP, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Rapp is a Los Angeles free-lance writer 
who, as Mr. Mother Earth, has written several best-selling books on indoor 
gardening. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I love the look of ivy, and I've tried to grow an ivy plant in an 
east window, a west window and recently a south window, but in each case the 
plant has slowly withered up, turned brown and died. I've tried fertilizing and 
not fertilizing. Nothing works. Please help! 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: My guess is you're trying to grow Hedera ivy, which includes 
ubiquitous varieties such as English ivy (H. helix). This type of ivy is very 
difficult to grow indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 I recommend that your next ivy plant be a member of the Cissus family, such as 
a grape ivy (C. rhombifolia). The look is the same, but the difference is that 
Cissus ivies are extremely easy to grow indoors. Keep your grape ivy in medium 
light, allow the soil to dry out between waterings, spray with a fine mist of 
water as often as possible, and fertilize once a month with a good liquid plant 
food. I guarantee you'll be delighted with the results. Can Staghorn Fern Be 
Mounted on Board? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I recently bought a staghorn fern that came in a six-inch plastic pot. I've 
seen these plants mounted on boards and they look great. Is there any way I can 
mount this potted staghorn onto a board? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Yes. Staghorn ferns, botanically Platycerium bifurcatum, are ephiphytes, or 
air plants -- plants which need not be potted in soil to survive. Hung on a 
board on a wall, this majestic plant could be mistaken for a hunter's trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 A staghorn fern that's been raised in a pot will do very well if removed and 
affixed to practically anything, as long as it gets medium filtered light, and 
frequent mistings with a water and plant food solution. Another tip: About once 
a month, take your staghorn fern and whatever it's attached to and give it a 
good dunking in the bathtub. Let it soak in cool water overnight if possible. 
How to Get Peace Lily to Start Blooming 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I have a peace lily that won't bloom. The leaves are all lovely and green, 
but in the year and a half I've had the plant in the entryway of my house, it 
hasn't bloomed once. What should I do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You have two choices: Leave it in your entryway and continue to enjoy the 
peace lily (Spathiphyllum spp.) for its lovely foliage, or move it to a spot 
where it gets lots and lots of light. If you keep the soil moist and feed every 
other week, it will most likely start producing the beautiful lily-like blooms 
for which it is coveted.

WHAT THE UNHANDY NEED THIS SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY M. GALLES, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Galles is an associate professor of 
economics at Pepperdine University. His wife claims he is unhandy, but he 
insists he would do just fine if he only had the right tools. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer is here. And with it comes stories of home and garden improvements for 
the handyman. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, almost all those stories start with the tools necessary to do 
the job. This eliminates most of us, who have neither the appropriate tools nor 
the appropriate skills, at the start. Most real men (as opposed to "real men") 
are "unhandy," shudder at the phrase "some assembly required," and panic at any 
job so complex it requires instructions (as if we would read them). Our 
"Tooltime" behavior differs from those of handymen in ways that even "more 
power" cannot solve. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are unhandy, the most obvious characteristic of your toolbox is that 
you "never have the right tool for the job." Since the cost of having a 
complete set of tools you never intend to use clearly exceeds the benefits, 
when an emergency forces you into the handyman role, you curse the fact that 
you don't have what you need. Of course, having such tools before they are 
necessary is really a form of insurance against unforeseen household 
contingencies, and being without the right tool for the job is simply a 
consequence of choosing not to pay for toolbox "insurance." 
</P>
<P>
 A further consequence of never having the right tool is that, to abuse Hamlet, 
"Always a borrower; never a lender be." Since you don't have the right tools 
and you don't want to buy them, you prey on your neighbors' toolboxes. 
Professionals (who quickly learn to leave their tools at work) and other 
handymen in the neighborhood (who learn not to be home when you knock) are 
particularly at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, since you have no tools that others want to borrow to serve as 
collateral to force the return of their tools, there is typically little 
incentive to return them, as the same sort of emergency might arise again, 
especially since the odds that you fixed it "right" the first time are slim. 
Given that your borrowing victims also know this, with just the right "pity me" 
approach, you can sometimes even succeed in borrowing your neighbor along with 
his tools, since that is the only way he can be sure of getting the tools back 
when the job is done. 
</P>
<P>
 Failing the attempt to lay your hands on some neighbor's tools, you try to use 
the tool closet in intended use to what you need (e.g., your heaviest wrench, 
in the absence of a hammer). When combined with the fact that you bought the 
cheapest tools you could find because you didn't intend to use them much (which 
is also why you can't ever justify to yourself the extra money for power tools 
instead of "grunt-powered" ones), your tools often get broken. Then, in 
desperation, you turn to the kitchen and sewing box, using kitchen knives as 
screwdrivers and even the "good" scissors as an X-acto knife (if you are really 
desperate and unhandy, you might even go for the pinking shears, though the 
results won't look pretty). 
</P>
<P>
 Despite having fewer tools in general, "unhandymen" tend to have messier 
toolboxes. Those who use their tools intensively find it is worth the effort 
not only to use the right tool for the job, but also to put it back where it 
belongs; those who hope to never touch one of them again are much less careful. 
This negligence leads to a proliferation of incomplete tool sets, as those 
crucial sockets and drill bits soon go to tool heaven. It also eventually leads 
to having too many screwdrivers and other simple tools, since the ones already 
in the house were misplaced and forgotten the last time they were used, and a 
new one must be bought. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, since unhandymen have no organized place for various chore remains 
(like the instructions they didn't read, but think they might if the emergency 
just past has a sequel, all the unused washers and miscellaneous "what did this 
go to?" plumbing pieces, and the stolen kitchen utensils they refused or forgot 
to return), they all end up thrown away (in which case they are soon needed) or 
dumped in the toolbox. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why the risk of getting impaled on leftover nails and other 
miscellaneous cutting edges is borne every time someone reaches in. Because 
toolboxes have limited storage space, this also soon leads to an overflowing 
toolbox that cannot be shut or easily moved, which in turn eventually leads to 
the inability to even find the toolbox under the avalanche of the other junk 
thrown in the garage to avoid putting it where it belongs. 
</P>
<P>
 It is wonderful to know that there is a virtual cornucopia of thrilling 
do-it-yourself projects for us to do this summer. But most of us have no 
intention of actually doing them. All that the majority of us unhandymen really 
want to know is what tools we need to simply appear to be handy. Beyond that, 
all we need is some guidance on where to find them, so that we don't have to 
wander aimlessly around the nearest warehouse store looking for them.

 My neighbor has a potbelly pig that smells and grunts. Can my condo 
association take action to get rid of this nuisance? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the association can try to both enact and enforce pet restrictions. But 
such restrictions are currently being challenged in a case before the 
California Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 The case of "Nahrstedt v. Lakeside Village Condominium Association" set the 
stage for a legal conflict between the rights of homeowners and the powers of 
condo association boards. 
</P>
<P>
 Natore Nahrstedt, a resident of Lakeside Village Condominiums in Culver City, 
believed it was reasonable for her to keep three cats even though her deed 
restrictions read, "No animals (which shall mean dogs and cats), livestock, 
reptiles or poultry shall be kept in any unit." She filed suit after the board 
assessed fines of $500 a month against her. 
</P>
<P>
 In overturning a lower court decision that ruled in favor of the Lakeside 
Village association, a California appeals court "sought to limit overly 
technical and petty rule enforcement and to make sure that CC&R violations 
would only be prosecuted if they involved some provable harm or inconvenience 
to other owners," according to Evan McKenzie, author of "Privatopia, Homeowner 
Associations and the Rise of Residential Private Government," (Yale University 
Press: 1994).

APARTMENT LIFE: CHECKLIST FORMS AVAILABLE FOR RENTERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN POSTEMA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Postema is the editor of Apartment Age 
magazine, a publication of the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los Angeles, an 
apartment owners' service group. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I am a renter and I live in Tustin. In your July 3 column, under the 
question titled "Using Move-In Checklist Avoids Move-Out Woes," you recommended 
that owners and renters alike use inventory checklists before moving into 
apartments to determine the condition of everything inside them. 
</P>
<P>
 You also mentioned in the column that the Apartment Assn. of Greater Los 
Angeles (AAGLA) produces such a form. I understand that AAGLA is an apartment 
owners' service group, but getting such a from is immensely important to me as 
a renter. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any way you can send me a copy of the form? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Although AAGLA is a membership organization that generally dispenses 
forms only to its members, as a public service for the next 30 days, renters 
may pick up copies of AAGLA's Inventory Checklist form (one per person) at any 
of AAGLA's three Los Angeles County offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The offices are at 621 S. Westmoreland Ave., Los Angeles (213) 384-4131; 12012 
Wilshire Blvd., West L.A. (310) 820-7651; 17707 Crenshaw Blvd., Suite 210, 
Torrance (310) 532-9245. 
</P>
<P>
 The Westmoreland Avenue office is open from 9 a.m.-5 p.m., Monday through 
Friday. The West L.A. and South Bay offices are open the same hours, except 
they are closed from noon-1 p.m. for lunch. What Is Policy on Credit-Checking 
Fees? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: For the past six years, I have been a summer tenant at a Newport Beach 
apartment complex. This year, for the first time, when I paid the first month's 
rent I was asked to pay an additional $20 credit checking fee, which I did. 
</P>
<P>
 Since I have a five-year record of prompt payment of rent and no problems at 
this complex, I am wondering whether this fee is legal or just a gimmick. If it 
is legal, am I entitled to a copy of my credit report? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Perhaps the owners of this complex have had a bad experience with a 
formerly good renter, or they may just be tightening their rental policies 
because of the recession. Either way, credit checking fees are legal and some 
institutions charge even more than $20 for them. 
</P>
<P>
 You are entitled to a copy of your credit report, but you must get it directly 
from the credit reporting agency. The owners or managers of the complex are 
prohibited by law from giving it to you. 
</P>
<P>
 However, they must provide you with the name and phone number of the credit 
reporting agency from which they got the report, which must provide you with a 
copy of the report upon your written request. He's Off Deep End Over Pool 
Changes 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I live in Fullerton and I have a problem. The main reason I moved into this 
apartment about a year ago was for the large swimming pool areas it provided me 
and my guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, after this privilege was abused by a few occupants whose guests 
had small children, the pool rules were drastically altered by the management. 
Now, no guests are allowed in the pool and the hours have been shortened. 
</P>
<P>
 Why should adults be punished for the transgressions of children? Even though 
the hours on the pool sign were changed to the new ones, it still reads "2 
guests per apartment." Does that matter? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I am assuming that you were given a written notice of the pool rule 
changes, so it would be difficult to argue that you were confused by the 
unchanged poolside sign, which could be altered by the management anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 As you say in your letter, the pool " . . . privilege was abused by a few 
occupants whose guests had small children;" while the apartment's management 
might have found a better solution to the problem, the one they found seems to 
be legal and rational. Interest on Security Deposit Is Overdue 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I lived in a West Los Angeles apartment for two years before moving to 
Alexandria, Va., earlier this year. When I left I asked the owner if he owed me 
any interest on my security deposit, he said that law was no longer effective. 
</P>
<P>
 A friend's mother inquired about the interest on my behalf. She was told that 
the law, passed in November, 1990, is still in effect and that it requires 5% 
interest payments on security deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 When I got my deposit refund there was, of course, no interest payment 
included. I have notified the owner several times by certified mail that he 
owes me the money, over $100, but he refuses to even respond to my requests for 
payment. 
</P>
<P>
 If I have to come to L.A. to sue in Small Claims Court to recover the 
interest, can I also get the cost of air fare, hotel accommodations, lost wages 
and so forth? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The Los Angeles City Interest on Deposits law is still in effect for 
rent-controlled rental properties in the city. If you had a $1,000 security 
deposit for two years with the owner, he owes you $100 in interest for that. 
</P>
<P>
 And while you generally cannot recover lost wages, travel and housing costs in 
Small Claims Court, the court can penalize an owner $600 for the "bad faith" 
retention of a security deposit, of which the interest would seem to be a part. 
</P>
<P>
 Sending the owner a copy of this column, with a written request for payment of 
the interest owed, and subsequently not being paid, might prove your "bad 
faith" claim in court, which may pay for your air fare and lodging. What's 
Easiest Way to Evict Two Lodgers? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I live in Dana Point and I read your May 15 column in which you told how 
easy it is for a homeowner to rid himself of a lodger when there is only one on 
the premises because of a special law. 
</P>
<P>
 My question is how does that law apply to a homeowner who has two lodgers in 
his home? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It doesn't. As I emphasized in the previous column, "this remedy only 
applies to lodgers in owner-occupied dwellings where there is only one 
lodger/tenant." 
</P>
<P>
 Where there is more than one lodger/tenant, you must evict a renter just like 
a residential renter in an apartment building.

WRONG BRACE MAKES DAMAGE WORSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding the article headlined "Securing Your Chimney in Case of Quake" (July 
31), the Uniform Building Code, Section 3704(c) requires anchor straps to be 
connected to 2-by-4 ties crossing a minimum of four joists or rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 If done as shown (only one or two joists), this bracing could cause more 
damage to the house during an earthquake than before the remedial work 
suggested. The whole job is not for a novice; use only those experienced in 
wood-frame construction in the local area.

 As I looked at the diagram with the chimney-bracing article ("Securing Your 
Chimney in Case of Quake," July 31), certain obvious problems caught my eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely, the rafters were 2-by-4s or 2-by-6s spaced 24 inches apart. 
Obviously, the two lag bolts shown could not be bolted to a typical rafter and 
a single bolt would be difficult to properly attach on a 1 1/2-inch rafter (the 
finished dimension of a 2-by-4), and even if connected, would be rendered 
ineffective in a significant earthquake by either splitting or breaking the 
rafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, most pitched roofs do not have solid sheathing nailed to the rafters. 
Over the years, spaced 1-by-6 boards have been the common construction practice 
in attic areas beneath roof shingles, so even if bolts were attached to the 
rafters, the roof system would be unable to offer much resistance to support 
the chimney. 
</P>
<P>
 A solution would be to place wood blocking beneath the bolts and between 
adjacent rafters and wood sheathing on the underside of the rafters.

 Abrams replies: It's my experience after the Northridge quake that a chimney 
brace bolted into even one rafter is better than nothing, but clearly it's 
preferable to bolt it to as many rafters as possible or to add blocking in the 
attic across several joists. However, in most modern Southern California homes, 
with vaulted ceilings and no attic, blocking or bracing is not possible.

MOST UNFORGETTABLE APPRAISAL OF A HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In defense of Robert J. Bruss on appraisers and appraisals, here is the most 
unforgettable appraisal I ever saw: 
</P>
<P>
 Several years ago, I requested a copy of the appraisal from a company that was 
trying to sell me a second-trust deed. The independent appraisal showed a 
two-story house of sizable square footage in Laguna Beach with a high value.A 
drive to the address showed a one-story bungalow in then-unlivable condition, 
with two guys on the roof hammering away in after-work hours on what might have 
been the gleam of a second story in the owner's eye. 
</P>
<P>
 No, I didn't report the appraiser to the licensing bureau, although I should 
have. And no, it is not the only dubious appraisal I ever received. And yes, I 
do think most appraisers are ethical and conscientious.

HATS OFF TO REALTORS WHO DON'T 'ESCREW' US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Carrie Wulf's short essay on the evolution of getting "escrewed" perpetrates 
the false reality in real estate today. 
</P>
<P>
 Her comparison to a sales assistant is misrepresentative of the complexity of 
gaining a real estate license. Did you know even after a realtor is licensed 
that it is renewable every four years, and every year realtors must continue 
their education by attending a certain number of courses. 
</P>
<P>
 When you put your house up for sale, you employ a qualified real estate sales 
agent to make comparative market analysis of your house and neighborhood. They 
also hold brokers' open houses, office caravans, public open houses, they place 
ads in the Multiple Listing Service, local and major newspapers and create and 
distribute flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Where do you think the money comes from to advertise your home all these ways? 
Let's not forget the realtor's fees -- brokerage fees, taxes, license and MLS 
fees, errors and omissions and car insurance, gas, stationery, just to name a 
few.  
</P>
<P>
 When I bought my house, I was extremely glad to have these professionals 
around to explain the complexity of buying real estate in California. Our 
forefathers had gun battles over land ownership. 
</P>
<P>
 So, from a very supportive spouse of a Coldwell Banker, Hancock Park, real 
estate agent, it's my hat off to the realtors of this world and may you all be 
driving $70,000 autos.

 Carrie Wulf obviously doesn't have a clue as to the countless hours realtors 
spend before a sale can be completed. Hours of schooling to get our licenses, 
45 continuous education classes every four years, not to mention countless 
seminars and lectures we attend each year. We spend time and money 
merchandising our listings, hold open houses, previews, look at hundreds of 
homes a month, as well as spend money on brochures, and keeping abreast of 
money markets, all for the benefit of our clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing an offer and getting it accepted is just the beginning of completing a 
successful closing. Escrows are always full of problems, but, problems that a 
professional realtor is able to solve.  
</P>
<P>
 Your article was a kick in the teeth to all those people who aided you in the 
home you bought. You owe them a debt of gratitude and certainly an apology for 
your ignorant perception of what we service people really do.

MIKE DOWNEY: FERTILE GROUND FOUND TO CREATE FIELD OF ESTEEMED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DOWNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Roberto Clemente stole three bases, Willie Mays homered and tripled, and Sandy 
Koufax scattered six hits as the National League defeated the American League, 
3-2, in this week's memorial flashback game inside a baseball fan's mind.  
</P>
<P>
 The game was interrupted by a bench-clearing brawl after Ty Cobb said 
something about Lou Gehrig's wife. Joe DiMaggio told Cobb that he should be 
ashamed of himself, but Babe Ruth advised DiMaggio to mind his own business.  
</P>
<P>
 The game took only two hours to play and ended long before children went to 
bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Mickey Mantle, who has no incentive clauses in his contract for statistics or 
appearances because "that's what they pay me for," began the game with a 
leadoff hit against Koufax that he legged into a double.  
</P>
<P>
 After dusting himself off, Mantle pinched the bridge of his nose as though 
suffering from a painful headache, then whispered to shortstop Ernie Banks, 
"You'll never know how hard that was." 
</P>
<P>
 Banks smiled at Mantle and said, "Yes, but oh, isn't this a beautiful 
morning?" 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Robinson followed by hitting behind the runner, exactly the way he had 
been taught, and advanced Mantle to third with a deep drive to Clemente in 
right field, for which he was justifiably given a sacrifice fly. The runner 
then scored on Ruth's single off the top of the right field fence.  
</P>
<P>
 Ruth nearly ruined the game before it began by holding out for free hot dogs, 
but was talked out of it by American League starting pitcher Satchel Paige, who 
said: "Man, how many chances like this will I ever get?" 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibition was broadcast to a nationwide radio audience, sponsored by 
Burma Shave lather and Van Heusen dress shirts. The $1 parking fee was donated 
to war relief.  
</P>
<P>
 A twi-night doubleheader was originally scheduled, but Game 2 had to be 
suspended because of an approaching thunderstorm and the fact that baseball was 
naturally being played outdoors. Also, Gehrig had promised his wife that he 
would be home by 5 o'clock.  
</P>
<P>
 Second baseman Jackie Robinson beat out a bunt to begin the bottom of the 
first. In the press box, broadcaster Red Barber tousled the red hair of his 
young partner and said, "We may be seeing the beginning of something here." His 
partner agreed and said: "Pull up a chair, because this one should be a dandy." 
</P>
<P>
 Pete Rose collected $2 bills from several teammates in the dugout.  
</P>
<P>
 "Told you that kid would get on," Rose said.  
</P>
<P>
 The next batter was National League first baseman Marv Throneberry, who said 
he still couldn't understand what he was doing in this game. He struck out on 
three pitches and was immediately replaced in the lineup by Stan Musial.  
</P>
<P>
 Henry Aaron struck out, but Mays drove home Robinson with a triple to the gap 
in right-center. Tagged out by Yogi Berra trying to stretch it into an 
inside-the-park home run, Mays shook hands with Robinson -- a simple handshake, 
in which one man grips the other's hand and squeezes.  
</P>
<P>
 Pee Wee Reese put an arm around Robinson's shoulders and brought him his 
glove.  
</P>
<P>
 The score remained 1-1 until the bottom of the seventh, right after the 
lucky-number program drawing. Batting for the pitcher, pinch-hitter Vic Wertz 
crushed a ball that drove Mays all the way to the warning track in center, 
scoring Cobb, who tagged up at third and slid spikes-first into Johnny Bench's 
mask. On the bench, Don Drysdale told Koufax to be sure to stick one in Cobb's 
ear.  
</P>
<P>
 American League Manager Miller Huggins had made a suggestion not to have 
pitchers bat for themselves, but the National Leaguers all looked at him as 
though he were nuts.  
</P>
<P>
 At one point, hundreds of fans rose and sat, rose and sat, waving their arms, 
until older customers told them to sit down and stop blocking their view. 
Several elderly women, admitted at half-price on Ladies' Day, got into an 
argument with a man smoking a cigar, but it ended quickly when a fast-thinking 
vendor gave everyone a free bottle of beer.  
</P>
<P>
 In the ninth inning, Brooks Robinson saved a run with a diving grab at third, 
but Mays followed with a game-winning two-run homer on a suspiciously slow 
fastball by relief pitcher Eddie Cicotte. The ball cleared the left field fence 
and went into the corn. Shoeless Joe Jackson toppled over the fence trying to 
make the catch and was never seen again.  
</P>
<P>
 Mays really belted that apple off the vanquished hurler, ending the tussle 
with his round-tripper in the final stanza.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would play this game for free," Mays said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Me, too," Paige said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Like hell," Cobb said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Money isn't everything," DiMaggio said.  
</P>
<P>
 "What's important is the game," Frank Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "And the fans," Brooks Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "And opportunity," Jackie Robinson said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I consider myself the luckiest man on the face of the Earth," Gehrig said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, give it a rest," Ruth said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Let's play two," Banks said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Let's play forever," Musial said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Wish I could," Clemente said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Me too," Drysdale said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Not me," Koufax said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to break some records," Aaron said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Ten bucks says you do," Rose said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You should switch-hit," Mantle said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Mickey's amphibious," Berra said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we made more money," Cicotte said.  
</P>
<P>
 "We will," a younger man said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lots more," a second man said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Tons more," a third man said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Who are you guys?" a fan asked.  
</P>
<P>
 "The future," they replied.

JIM MURRAY: ON STRIKE AGAIN: IT'S THE SAME OLD STORY, ISN'T IT? 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All baseball is Mudville today. No joy. More than Mighty Casey has struck out. 
The whole game has.  
</P>
<P>
 Accordingly, I think I will reprise a column I wrote the last time the grand 
old game became just another labor dispute. Went on a protracted walkout. 
</P>
<P>
 The game hasn't changed. Neither have I. Here is what I wrote then. And would 
again now:  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is not crabbed old men sitting around a negotiating table, 
serenading each other with the stilted prose of 'whereases' and 'in 
consideration of the specifications thereto' and 'parties of the second part 
hereinafter referred to as the bargaining committee of the employees of said 
major league clubs.' 
</P>
<P>
 "That's not baseball.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is Willie Mays scuttling out after a long one with his back to home 
plate and that peculiar sideways gait of his, clutching his glove in a pouch at 
his waist as his hat flies off. Baseball is Willie Mays robbing Vic Wertz of a 
three-base hit and the World Series. That's baseball.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is not some London insurance man in a frock coat dangling a policy 
that will cost his company more than a ship sinking.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is DiMag waiting at the plate in that classic straight-up stance of 
his for a Bob Feller fastball.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is not labor lawyers and contract negotiators and federal mediators. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is Musial crouched at the plate like a leopard on a limb, guessing 
curve, but coiled for the heater if it comes. Baseball is Koufax staring down 
the barrel where Mickey Mantle waits, waggling the biggest bat you've ever 
seen.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball isn't codicils and writs and preliminary injunctions.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is Pete Rose going in headfirst with the winning run. Baseball is 
Clemente settling under a high one and turning slightly sideways so he can 
throw out the runner trying to go home on the out.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is not cold men with agate eyes fighting over balance sheets and 
player pools and player depreciation.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is Rod Carew with the pitcher in a hole and the left fielder shading 
too far to his left, leaving a tiny pocket to drop an extra-base hit down the 
left-field line.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is Babe Ruth pointing, Ty Cobb sliding. It's Whitey Ford loading one 
up for Campanella with the Series on the line. It's Lou Gehrig standing in 
Yankee Stadium for the last time, trying not to cry as he tells the world how 
lucky he is to be a Yankee. That's baseball.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball players are not migrant workers. They don't pick grapes for a 
living. They don't find work out of waterfront shape-ups, they don't sew 
dresses in dingy factory lofts. They're custodians of little boys' dreams. 
Little boys of all ages -- 8 to 80.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball has to do with our youth. We're all 25 years younger when we take 
our seats, hot dog in hand, at the ballpark, yelling, 'Play ball, you donkeys!' 
and it's like the day again when our fathers took us to our first doubleheader 
at the old ballgrounds out of town where the open trolleys dumped off the loads 
of fans in straw hats and sleeve garters. Baseball is 'The Boys of Summer' and 
we're all the boys of summer.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is 'Why dint he bunt?' or 'Why dint he start Drysdale?' or 'Why dint 
he walk 'im?' or 'Why dint he pinch-hit for 'im?' Baseball is controversy, 
lovely controversy, happy controversy. Not the controversy of 'parties of the 
first part' or 'in consideration whereof.' A strike in baseball is a belt-high 
fastball, not a national catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is the Big Six, the Big Train, Shoeless Joe. It's Grover Alexander 
with bloodshot eyes sneaking the fast one by Lazzeri with the bases loaded and 
Ruth coming up next. Baseball is 'Alston, yer a bum!' and 'Call yerself an 
umpire, do you, Shag? You couldn't see Alaska!' 
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is not pompous rich men exercising their arrogance. Baseball is 
coddled by society like an over-protected child. Baseball owes this society. It 
is the beneficiary of millions in free advertising, and in exemptions from the 
basic laws of the republic. Baseball is a temple into which the money-changers 
should not have been allowed to creep.  
</P>
<P>
 "Baseball is wondrous eccentrics, Dizzy and Rube, Billy Loes -- and Casey 
Stengel hobbling out to the mound on lumpy legs, a creature out of a Black 
Forest treehouse, a Rumpelstiltskin in pin stripes. Baseball is our exemption 
from the clangorous world of commerce, or the burning blocks, the seamy 
streets, that other world where there are never any clear-cut winners, only 
degrees of losers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Oliver Wendell Holmes himself said baseball was a sport, not a business. It's 
not Wall Street, it's Dream Street. It's three hours on a desert island for a 
guy who has to go home to a peeling tenement and a 6 o'clock alarm when it's 
over and maybe a job with a broom. It's our great escape, our uncommon 
denominator. So, get the lawyers out, leave the little boys in.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just do me a favor. Leave it alone. Go louse up your other businesses."

FOUR MORE YEARS FOR ROTHENBERG; SOCCER: FIFA INFLUENCE FELT AS WORLD CUP '94 
CHIEF IS REELECTED ON SECOND BALLOT IN CLOSE USSF PRESIDENTIAL RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE CART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan Rothenberg narrowly won reelection to his second four-year term as 
president of the U.S. Soccer Federation on Saturday, thanks in large measure to 
the intervention of FIFA, the sport's international governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing a battle for his political life, Rothenberg called in all of his 
favors. That meant bringing in the most powerful man in soccer, Brazil's Joao 
Havelange, the FIFA president, who spent the weekend campaigning for 
Rothenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with FIFA's help, Rothenberg did not gain the landslide victory he had 
predicted. Needing 51% of the vote to win, Rothenberg polled 48.8% on the first 
ballot. USSF treasurer Richard Groff had 46.9% and USSF executive vice 
president Hank des Bordes had 4.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 20-minute second vote, the huge hotel ballroom grew quiet and 
tense. "Somebody told me that penalty kicks were bad," U.S. World Cup Coach 
Bora Milutinovic, a Rothenberg supporter, said during the lull. "This is 
worse." 
</P>
<P>
 Des Bordes withdrew after the first vote and Rothenberg prevailed on the 
second ballot, 53.4% to 46.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the success of the World Cup, which he helped organize, Rothenberg has 
been a controversial figure within the USSF during his four-year team. His 
current difficulty centers on Rothenberg's twin positions as president of the 
USSF and head of the proposed new professional league, Major League Soccer. 
Many within the USSF, particularly from the pro division, see this as a 
conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The pro vote, which delivered the election to Rothenberg in 1990, nearly cost 
him the presidency this time. The three voting blocks -- professional, amateur 
and youth -- split among the candidates. Only one of the four pro leagues voted 
for Rothenberg. His strength came from the amateur division and Groff took most 
of the pro vote and some of the youth. 
</P>
<P>
 Havelange's unprecedented attendance here has angered some delegates who 
resent FIFA's interference in the election. Most voters remember FIFA's support 
for Rothenberg's election in 1990. FIFA's role then consisted merely of a phone 
call to one presidential candidate, asking him to withdraw from the race. 
</P>
<P>
 FIFA's role in this election has been far more open. At a banquet Friday 
night, Havelange spoke for several minutes and lavished praise on Rothenberg, 
mentioning him by name some 16 times. On an evening that was meant to celebrate 
the sport of soccer in the United States, Havelange's nomination speech seemed 
out of place. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Rothenberg admitted that Havelange's dinner speech lacked subtlety and 
ran the risk of backfiring -- USSF delegates might not have appreciated an 
international body meddling in the internal politics of a member federation. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little heavier-handed than I would have written it," Rothenberg 
said. "I was cringing." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the day, Havelange had summoned candidate Des Bordes to his hotel 
room. Speculation was that FIFA would request that Des Bordes, who had little 
chance to win, withdraw. Des Bordes would not reveal what was said but 
reiterated late Friday night that he was still in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Des Bordes dropped out after the first ballot. Further fueling the 
FIFA-deal theory, apparently all of Des Bordes' delegates went over to 
Rothenberg on the second ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Groff, for all of his conciliatory talk after the vote, was clearly angry with 
the FIFA influence on the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 "FIFA is very insensitive to the operation of individuals with their 
constituents in the United States Soccer Federation," Groff said. "They didn't 
need to push so hard. FIFA is so scared to death that if Alan is not in front 
of MLS, it won't succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took that one step further -- if Alan is not president of the U.S. 
Soccer Federation, MLS won't succeed. It was all totally inappropriate." 
</P>
<P>
 Havelange and FIFA senior vice president Guillermo Canedo were present to 
observe Saturday morning's voting, but their interest apparently extended only 
to observing the presidential election. Havelange briefly addressed delegates 
before the vote, then left the room immediately after Rothenberg was reelected. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg's reelection, whatever it might hold for the future of soccer, does 
seem to settle the issue of Milutinovic's future. Milutinovic would have been 
unlikely to remain as national coach had Rothenberg lost the election.

MORNING BRIEFING: THE PROFITS AREN'T HARD TO SWALLOW 
</P>

 The refreshment of Rose Bowl champions can be yours, Wisconsin Badger fans, 
courtesy of the makers of Badger Max, a new sports drink. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Sporting News, the University of Wisconsin is marketing the 
drink, with proceeds going to the school. In a test, 8,000 cases were shipped 
in June. By August, it had orders for 100,000 cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Badger Max is a fruit-flavored mix of vitamins and minerals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our version of Gatorade," says David Ellis, the nutritionist who developed 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatorade was developed by Dr. Robert Cade for University of Florida football 
players in the mid-'60s, then marketed. 
</P>
<P>
 It does $900 million to $1 billion in sales annually. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Designated hitter Bob Hamelin recently broke the Kansas City 
Royals' record for most home runs by a rookie. Before the strike, Hamelin had 
24 home runs. Who holds the American League record for most homers by a rookie, 
and whose record did he break? 
</P>
<P>
 Field general: Dave Brown, who had a dual major in history and political 
science at Duke, recently was chosen as the probable regular-season starting 
quarterback by New York Giant Coach Dan Reeves. 
</P>
<P>
 But Brown sounded more affected by practicing at Maifeld in Berlin, where the 
Giants played the San Diego Chargers on Saturday and where Adolf Hitler once 
mustered 500,000 troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's awesome," Brown told Newsday's George Willis. "I could envision the 
troops lined up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Willis estimates that the stadium, which is surrounded by concrete seats, 
could accommodate four football fields. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish we had half this (space) back at Fairleigh Dickinson," offensive line 
coach Pete Mangurian said, comparing it to the Giants' training facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Won't get fooled again: At least one NFL player looks at the way the baseball 
players union is handling the current impasse and wishes the NFL players had 
the same kind of leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota Viking kicker Fuad Reveiz blames executive director Gene Upshaw of 
the NFL Players Assn. for the football union's problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was the one who came to all of our meetings and said under no 
circumstances is there going to be a cap," Reveiz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, we wake up one day and there's a salary cap. It was just 
deceitfulness. Why do you think the guy hasn't come to any training camps yet 
this year?" 
</P>
<P>
 Of the baseball players, Reveiz said, "Obviously, they have better leadership 
in their union. Without a doubt, they're sitting back there thinking, 'Do I 
want to be as stupid as the football players are?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: On Aug. 11, 1987, Mark McGwire of the Oakland Athletics broke 
Al Rosen's American League rookie record by hitting his 38th home run. McGwire 
finished his rookie season with 49 homers. 
</P>
<P>
 Quotebook: Montreal Expo Manager Felipe Alou as his first-place team headed 
into the strike: "I feel like the fisherman who has made a record catch, but 
has to throw the fish back." TIM KAWAKAMI

POINT OF VIEW / BOB OATES: THE SECOND-BIGGEST SEASON; EXHIBITION GAMES GET 
FOOTBALL FANS' ATTENTION; NFL NEEDS ONE IMPROVEMENT: BETTER PLAY-CALLING 
</P>

<P>
 Again it's late summer in America, and to sports fans, that means, among other 
things, the reappearance of pro football. This is the NFL's 75th anniversary 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 And as the fun begins, here are three of the year's most frequently asked 
questions: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why do so many Americans spend so many summer days and evenings viewing 
exhibition football -- a fall sport? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Why do pro football players spend so much of their summer in training 
camps? 
</P>
<P>
 -- Who should call NFL plays -- coaches or quarterbacks? 
</P>
<P>
 Some answers: 
</P>
<P>
 * Football fans like exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
 There is more public support for the NFL exhibition season than many people 
realize. To American spectators, according to TV ratings, it is the second-most 
popular of all sports seasons -- behind only the NFL regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pro football's training camps are indispensable. 
</P>
<P>
 They are often wrongly compared to baseball's spring training -- which is in 
part a publicity gimmick. Football is an arduous, intricate team sport whose 
appeal would diminish without a lengthy series of hard days at training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 * Quarterbacks call better plays than coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 In a more perfect world, the NFL's training camps and the exhibition schedule 
would be used to give quarterbacks leadership experience. 
</P>
<P>
 The needless sameness of pro games, often criticized, stems mainly from the 
league's many conservative coaches, who keep sending in similar, safe, 
conventional plays. Most pro clubs would improve noticeably with 
quarterback-called plays, leading to improvements in the quality of their 
sport. 
</P>
<P>
 In particular, the Raiders would have been a Super Bowl team last season with 
better game-day decisions. They can win it this season if they let quarterback 
Jeff Hostetler call the plays. That should be their top priority. THE FINAL 
SCORE: LEAST IMPORTANT EXHIBITION STAT 
</P>
<P>
 To measure public interest in the various U.S. sports, one significant 
barometer is the number of TV viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent Nielsen findings: 
</P>
<P>
 For every 2 million Americans who watch NFL regular-season games, there are 
1,150,000 viewers for NFL exhibitions, 742,000 for NBA regular-season games, 
and 530,000 for baseball's regular-season games. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest full-schedule national rating averages: 
</P>
<P>
 NFL regular season, 13.2; NFL exhibition season, 7.6; NBA regular season, 4.9; 
major league baseball regular season, 3.5. 
</P>
<P>
 On ABC in recent weeks, the average American TV rating for the 11-game, 
once-in-a-lifetime World Cup tournament in the U.S. was 5.3. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhibition football seems out of place in that company, some would say. What's 
there to like about an exhibition? 
</P>
<P>
 Not the result, obviously. The least-important exhibition-game statistic is 
the final score, and largely for that reason sports fans prefer regular-season 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 In most NFL cities, indeed, the distribution of exhibition tickets is tied to 
regular-season ticket sales. 
</P>
<P>
 For TV spectators, however, there are no tie-ins. It's a fact that nobody 
forces Americans to turn to televised exhibition football. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet thousands do. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some of the reasons why: 
</P>
<P>
 First, there are more fans for football than other sports. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, in a typical exhibition-game first half, the teams tend to match their 
best players in what becomes something of a test of comparative strengths. 
Football fans view it as a mini-preview of the fall season. 
</P>
<P>
 Third, during the exhibition schedule, they also compare new and old players. 
Football fans enjoy keeping up, forecasting the future, nudging the coach. 
</P>
<P>
 And, fourth, the better TV commentators -- John Madden, Pat Haden, Bob Trumpy 
-- are usually informative. 
</P>
<P>
 And for football fans, that's enough. ARE YOU (PHYSICALLY) READY FOR SOME 
FOOTBALL? 
</P>
<P>
 As for the training-camp season, the excitement has always appealed to many of 
the hangers-on. 
</P>
<P>
 For the better part of half a century, it has seemed that the three best days 
of the year are Christmas, the first day of vacation, and the first day at 
training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 To football players, however, the camp season is something else. To many, it 
can be a grind. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who have been training in California for 49 years, once brought in 
150 candidates and ran them around in the oppressive Redlands heat until 
several passed out and dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 Said former Ram coach Sid Gillman, "That's how they used to cut the squad." 
</P>
<P>
 Training camp in those days was for running players into condition. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, most veterans, insuring their $700,000 salaries, work out 
year-around. And with as many as 80 candidates at any training camp, modern 
coaches prey on the players' minds, mainly, not their muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, for instance, on their first day at camp last month on the 
grounds of Oxnard's Radisson Suite Hotel, seemed physically ready for a game. 
</P>
<P>
 But they wouldn't have played well. Theirs is a sport with hundreds of 
different offensive and defensive procedures -- each involving precise teamwork 
-- that must be learned, practiced, and mastered. 
</P>
<P>
 That takes time. 
</P>
<P>
 So their summers are still crowded with all-day and all-evening meetings and 
practices. And although they still don't like it much, they wouldn't be a team 
in September without the grind of July and August. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp followers don't always understand the extent of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, hotel man Barron Hilton was unfamiliar with most training camp 
routines in 1960, when he founded the Los Angeles -- now San Diego -- Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilton, a former prep receiver, had made a fast start in pro ball by hiring 
the most distinguished coaches of his day, with Gillman in charge assisted by 
Al Davis, Al LoCasale, Jack Faulkner, Joe Madro and Chuck Noll. Today, three of 
the six, Gillman, Davis and Noll, are in the Hall of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the Chargers' first training camp, when a photographer wanted Hilton to 
pose with his four best receivers, he readily agreed -- and asked LoCasale to 
pick them out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm afraid I can't do that," said LoCasale, who is now No. 2 to the No. 1 
Raider, Davis. "We've got 12 prospects at those positions, and I never saw any 
of them before."  
</P>
<P>
 Said Hilton, "Don't worry about it, Al. Just pick out the four who are going 
to make the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Those were difficult days -- for others, too. Absent were two modern 
training-camp landmarks, the camera tower and a helmet pump. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years ago, NFL coaches waited a week for practice-field movies. Today's 
videotapes are instantly ready for viewing. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty years ago, nobody's helmet fit. That's one reason football players look 
so funny in the old pictures. Today, the players, using an air pump, carefully 
shape their expensive helmets to their heads vary considerably in size. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players are different, too," said Raider equipment manager Richard 
Romanski, whose opening day this summer was his 32nd. "Give me the old-timers. 
These millionaires are tough to handle." 
</P>
<P>
 But they work just as hard. WHY RUN ONE MAN INTO EIGHT DEFENSIVE LINEMEN? 
</P>
<P>
 NFL executives are missing another chance this summer to school their passers 
as play-callers in training-camp scrimmages and exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, fretting about noisy stadiums, they have wired their quarterbacks 
with helmet radios to make it easier for coaches to call the plays. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a major NFL mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Coaches have too much control already. 
</P>
<P>
 Too often on game day, all around the league, their first thought is for 
survival -- and, too often, that leads coaches to send in safe, unimaginative, 
unexciting plays that they can plausibly explain. 
</P>
<P>
 An off-tackle run that fails can be blamed on the blockers, or, in Los 
Angeles, on the ballcarrier. 
</P>
<P>
 The single most misunderstood aspect of today's high-tech football is the 
value of judicious play-calling. 
</P>
<P>
 We're talking about a lost art. 
</P>
<P>
 In a notorious recent example, Raider coaches, with the better players, were 
taken out of the playoffs last winter by the plays they called at Buffalo, 
where they opposed a team they should have eliminated -- a team they led at the 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 For 30 minutes, the Raiders had run the ball with some success, after which TV 
announcer O.J. Simpson asked both teams about their second-half strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Said the Raiders, "We're going to come out running." 
</P>
<P>
 Said the Bills, "We're going into a four-four front to stuff their run." 
</P>
<P>
 And with millions of sports fans apprised of their intentions, both teams did 
just as they had said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders kept running and punting to the Bills until they blew the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But it needn't have happened. 
</P>
<P>
 With a player as their play-caller, the Raiders, in the critical moments that 
day, would surely have thrown more often. For players are aware of sudden 
shifts from three-four to four-four fronts. They become immediately aware of 
any front that leaves only three opponents in the pass defense. 
</P>
<P>
 And Hostetler is more than just another player. A Super Bowl winner as 
recently as 1991, he is by far the best quarterback the Raiders have had since 
Jim Plunkett, who called the plays the last two times they were in the Super 
Bowl -- where they won games XV and XVIII. 
</P>
<P>
 What a good signal caller understands -- what Hostetler should be working on 
this summer in training camp and exhibition games -- is the gospel according to 
John Unitas, the Hall of Fame quarterback who said, "Take what the defense 
gives you." 
</P>
<P>
 Although that hasn't been a favorite Raider way, it's the way most Super Bowls 
are won. 
</P>
<P>
 It can mean passing when the opponents brace for a run. It can mean running if 
they're lining up in a pass defense. 
</P>
<P>
 And any good quarterback can be taught to call plays that way. In fact, it is 
his natural tendency. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterbacks know how easy it is to complete a pass on first down. They know 
how hard they're hit when asked to stand in the pocket on third and long. 
</P>
<P>
 Give a quarterback his head, he'll move you down the field the easiest way. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the above is crucial to this year's Raiders, whose chief executive, 
Davis, has signed -- for the second year in a row -- Super Bowl talent in most 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Raider coaches, Art Shell and his assistants, are experienced, 
proficient leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 They just shouldn't be calling the plays. 
</P>
<P>
 They do deserve prior knowledge of what their quarterback is up to. The radios 
should be in their hats.

 Don Fehr, executive director of the Major League Baseball Players Assn., and 
Richard Ravitch, chief negotiator for the owners, have received more air time 
than Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the Dick and Don Show or, as others have suggested, Fehr and Loathing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brothers Grimm. 
</P>
<P>
 Never have two officials supplied the same answers to the same questions on so 
many channels. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dick has a real bad PR writer," Fehr said the other day. "He has the same 
phrases no matter what the question is. I assume his answers are meant for 
someone." 
</P>
<P>
 Back in line, Geraldo. Wait your turn, Oprah. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are still more questions and answers pertaining to the players' strike, 
baseball's eighth work stoppage since 1972: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: The owners seem nervous. Are they ready to capitulate? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Nervous? Merely because Peter Angelos, owner of the Baltimore Orioles, 
compared their revenue-sharing plan to a welfare state "and you've seen what 
welfare has done to the country?" Merely because Jerry McMorris of the Colorado 
Rockies blindsided Ravitch by saying the pivotal salary cap issue should be 
negotiable and endorsed the view of New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner 
that the owners should be at the table? So far they are only brush fires, but 
there definitely is unrest among the bigger market clubs in regard to a 
prolonged stoppage. Acting commissioner Bud Selig has re-imposed a gag rule in 
an attempt to quiet it, but history suggests that owner unanimity is an 
oxymoron. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why aren't the owners at the table? 
</P>
<P>
 A: For the same reason that the owners have yet to hire a commissioner. 
Ravitch and Selig, who might be about to relent on this, knew that too many 
cooks had spoiled too many previous negotiations, so they decided Ravitch and 
staff would be their lone representatives. Problem is, the owners stripped him 
of the authority to make significant changes in their proposal, and the players 
keep fueling the fire by asking what Ravitch is trying to hide by not allowing 
owners to join him. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Cincinnati Red owner Marge Schott questioned Ravitch's negotiating 
experience. Does he have any? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Schott has again fallen victim to foot-in-mouth disease. Ravitch has a 
broad and impressive resume that prompted the owners to hire him for four years 
at $750,000 per year specifically to redesign the compensation system. Now they 
are biting at his back. True, he isn't an experienced baseball negotiator, but 
he negotiated a New York subway strike as chairman of the Metropolitan Transit 
Authority, and he is familiar with the give and take of politics. He received a 
modest 5% of the vote running for mayor of New York in a Democratic primary, 
but how many owners would receive 5% running in the city where their team 
plays? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is at stake financially? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The owners have $140 million in TV revenue at stake during the postseason 
and some of their biggest attendance dates in September. The Angels estimate 
they will lose $6 million if the rest of the season is canceled. The Chicago 
White Sox say they will lose $10 million. The owners do not have strike 
insurance as they did during the 50-day strike of 1981, primarily because some 
of the biggest carriers, such as Lloyds of London, determined that the 
insurance motivated the insured to keep the strike going. The owners do have a 
$260-million line of credit that was opened in 1992 and against which some 
clubs have already borrowed heavily. The players estimate they will lose $5 
million per day in salaries. The union, over the last four years, has retained 
a portion of each player's licensing check -- about $70,000 a year -- in 
amassing a strike fund of more than $175 million. The first checks, if the 
strike is still going, will be mailed Sept. 15, a normal pay day for the 
players, who are paid on the 15th and 30th of each month. They will be paid by 
their clubs on Monday for the first 11 days of August, and any performance 
bonus that has been achieved will be paid by the clubs on a prorated basis. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do managers and coaches get paid? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Although they are union members in that they are covered by the union's 
pension and benefit plans, managers and coaches will continue to be paid 
because they are under league contracts. Injured players who are undergoing 
treatment now or who need follow-up medical treatment or rehabilitation will 
continue to receive it through their clubs, but the clubs will not otherwise 
provide facilities or equipment to striking players. The union picked up travel 
expenses for players returning from the road when the strike began -- some 
clubs allowed players to travel on already booked charters -- but the union has 
asked players not to work out collectively during the strike because of 
insurance considerations. Fehr, who received $1 million in salary last year, 
and his administrative staff will not be paid during the strike, but the 
union's clerical help will be. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: When would the strike have to end for the postseason to be saved? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Both sides have dates in mind but aren't saying what they are. The regular 
season ends Oct. 2. The general feeling is that play would have to resume by 
Sept. 20, meaning the strike would have to end several days before that, giving 
the players time to recondition with their teams. The 50-day strike of 1981 
began June 12 and ended July 31. The All-Star game was played Aug. 9. The 
second half began Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How is this strike different from 1981? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The salary cap issue is more ideological and complex than '81, when the 
issue was compensation for the signing of free 
</P>
<P>
 agents. There is less middle ground this time, fewer areas of compromise, 
stronger feelings among all but the biggest clubs that the industry's overall 
economic and compensation system have to be changed. At the same time, owners 
might be under more pressure to find a quick resolution. They do not have 
strike insurance -- the '81 strike ended about the same time their insurance 
did -- and they lack breathing room if introduction of their new playoff and TV 
formats are to be saved. Mediation didn't help in '81 and is unlikely to help 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is the union so opposed to the salary cap and the owners' proposal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Four basic reasons: The union believes it would create an artificial 
ceiling and transfer millions of dollars from players to owners, who currently 
spend about 58% of revenue on player compensation and would spend 50% under 
terms of the proposal, although the percentage is negotiable; it would destroy 
free agency by taking many clubs near or at the cap out of the market and 
further restrict movement in many cases by providing a players' current club 
with the right of first refusal; it would inhibit rather than help (as Ravitch 
claims) competitive balance, since many roster decisions would be made on the 
basis of economics rather than ability (because 23 of the 28 teams have reached 
the postseason in the last 15 years, the union sees no problem with competitive 
balance and cites the World Series victories of the small-market Minnesota 
Twins in 1987 and '91, along with the success this year of the small-market 
Montreal Expos); clubs would be less inclined to aggressively market and 
generate revenue because they would be guaranteed a profit under the cap. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How many clubs are actually losing money? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The owners initially said 19 to 21 were projected to lose money this year. 
They included two cash cows, the Dodgers and Chicago White Sox, on that list. 
They now say 12 to 14 will lose money, a reduction the union cynically claims 
is the only progress made in these negotiations. No one knows how many clubs 
are losing money -- some believe only four or five, if that -- because the 
owners won't open their books. They have provided the union with figures, but 
the union remains skeptical. For the union, the real bottom line is this: An 
industry with revenue of $1.9 billion, up from $200 million in 1977, can't be 
in distress, as Selig claims, and shouldn't have to ask the players to pay back 
the bigger markets for helping out the smaller by linking a salary cap to 
increased revenue sharing. Also, if it's such a troubled business, why is the 
respected Larry Lucchino, former president of the Orioles, heading a group 
trying to buy the allegedly destitute Pittsburgh Pirates while only the strike 
is holding up sale of the Tom Werner-wrecked San Diego Padres? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Might not the owners have a case? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure. Salaries are up 800% since 1976. The major league average is $1.2 
million. The union subscribes too deeply, perhaps, to the Marvin Miller edict 
that you never give negotiating gains back. No one should feel sorry for the 
players. The owners' proposal still guarantees them the $1.2 million per year 
with a chance, according to the owners' figures, to more than double that over 
the course of a seven-year contract. The proposal also includes a floor that 
would actually force some of the small-market clubs to bring their payrolls up 
to it. There simply is so much doubt about the owners' contention of a troubled 
industry. So much doubt about the need for a salary cap when the owners 
themselves seemed reluctant for so long to help out their allegedly troubled 
smaller clubs with increased revenue sharing and only did so by linking it to 
the salary cap that Fehr calls a "Rube Goldberg contraption." It's the owners' 
house, of course, but is it raining hard enough to require a ceiling, 
artificial or otherwise? The doubt lingers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is there any area of compromise? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Only if the owners withdraw the salary cap, and even then it's murky. 
Presumably, the owners would ask the players to give up salary arbitration in 
exchange for unrestricted free agency after three or four years of major league 
service rather than six. Sources say the union would do that if the minimum 
salary of $109,000 also received a healthy boost, enabling younger players to 
move up the financial ladder quicker, compensating for the loss of arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What happens if owners declare an impasse and unilaterally implement their 
new system? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No one is sure. None of the previous stoppages have gone that far, but the 
union suspects that this is the owners' goal, despite the financial and public 
relations toll from the loss of 52 regular-season dates and the postseason. 
There are 167 players under contract for 1995, but would they choose to play 
under terms of a new system? Would the 500-plus unsigned players choose to 
sign? Would minor leaguers fill the empty spots and automatically become union 
members and possible scabs if they did? Would the union take its players and 
start a new league? Average Baseball Salary

 Average baseball salary as compiled by the Major League Baseball Players Assn. 
and the minimum salary. The 1994 figure is based on a survey by the Associated 
Press. Beginning in 1979, salary deferrals without interest are discounted at 
9% per year. For 1987-93, signing bonuses are increased at 9 percent per year:

 USC defensive coordinator Don Lindsey was enthusiastically discussing several 
freshman players the other day, explaining why he couldn't wait until contact 
work begins Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "Just looking at these new kids, they look great," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But you never know what you have until they put on pads.  
</P>
<P>
 "I'll never forget the first day of practice in 1976. Gary Jeter was a senior, 
Anthony Munoz was a freshman. On the first practice snap, Munoz bent Jeter over 
backward. 
</P>
<P>
 "None of the coaches said anything, but we all looked at each other, thinking 
the same thing: 'Hooray for us!' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson is calling his receivers, a season after Johnny Morton's 
departure, "the most underrated part of our team." 
</P>
<P>
 "This group is as good or better than our receiving corps last year," he said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, quarterback Rob Johnson passed for 3,285 yards, with Morton 
catching 88 passes for 1,520 yards and 14 touchdowns.  
</P>
<P>
 Morton is now with the Detroit Lions, but USC has his 1993 running mates, Ken 
Grace and Ed Hervey. The promising newcomers are freshmen Larry Parker of 
Bakersfield, Ken Haslip of Pasadena Muir and All-American junior college player 
Keyshawn Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Deon Strother, who caught 57 passes out of the fullback position, is now with 
the Denver Broncos. Offensive coordinator Mike Riley hopes quick, fast junior 
college transfer Leonard Green can run and catch in the Strother manner. 
</P>

 Injuries: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Backup tight end Jeff Diltz suffered a knee injury in the morning drill and 
watched the afternoon practice on crutches. His knee will be X-rayed Monday.

 -- Starting linebacker Gerald Caruthers broke a bone in his foot running last 
week and will sit out the Washington game Sept. 3. EARL GUSTKEY

STROM SAYS TROJANS STRONGER THIS YEAR; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: STRENGTH AND 
CONDITIONING COACH CITES A GREATER EMPHASIS ON OFF-SEASON WEIGHT TRAINING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the plays in USC's 1993 season, one stands out in John Robinson's 
memory of his first year back at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the kind of play he does not want to see repeated in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second play of the game at Notre Dame last Oct. 23.  
</P>
<P>
 At Notre Dame's 30-yard line, a split second after the Irish center snapped 
the ball, most Trojan defensive linemen were knocked on their backs. Another 
was sent airborne. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing film of the play later, Trojan coaches saw Notre Dame tailback Lee 
Becton step through the jumble of fallen Trojans and sprint 70 yards down the 
sideline -- right past Robinson, in fact -- for a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Notre Dame's more powerful offensive line continued to overpower USC's 
defensive line in the first half and the Irish went on to win, 31-13. 
</P>
<P>
 It became clear to everyone that day that while USC had one of the country's 
best passing games, one thing it could not do well was stand up to bigger, more 
powerful offensive lines.  
</P>
<P>
 It happened in two other games: a 21-20 loss at Penn State and a 27-21 loss to 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 At Notre Dame, Robinson made a mental note: Talk to Jim Strom after the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Strom, the Trojans' strength and conditioning coach, got a call the first 
Monday after the season ended. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked for about an hour," Strom said Saturday, watching what he says is a 
stronger team on USC's first full day of football practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said to me: 'Look, we've got to get stronger than this. We can't compete 
this way.' 
</P>
<P>
 "The big change here now is that there's a great emphasis on the weight 
training program, and the head coach is backing me up. My job is to make the 
players want to come to the weight room, to make it fun. Coach made it plain to 
me that day that if the players don't get stronger, then I have a big problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson and Strom decided that the Iron Horse competition, the culmination of 
the off-season weight training program, would become a major event. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it was last Thursday night, when all the trophies were moved out of the 
Heritage Hall lobby, two benches were brought in, and the players conducted 
their "World Series" of Trojan football weight lifting. 
</P>
<P>
 Six-foot-7, 305-pound offensive tackle Norberto Garrido bench-pressed 445 
pounds to win the competition. Tony Boselli, 6-7 1/2 and 320, was second at 435 
pounds. The pound-for-pound winner was defensive back Micah Phillips, who is 
listed at 185 pounds and lifted 370. 
</P>
<P>
 "We now have nine guys bench pressing over 400 pounds," said Strom, who worked 
for Robinson in his Ram years. "Last year, it was four." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the first day of full-team workouts, Robinson and his staff sent 
the Trojans through steamy morning and afternoon practices. 
</P>
<P>
 With frequent one-minute water breaks, offensive, defensive and kicking drills 
were held on Howard Jones Field and on the outfield of Dedeaux Field next door. 
</P>
<P>
 The last to arrive was Mt. San Antonio College transfer Leonard Green, who 
finished up his classwork at Mt. SAC on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 A running back whom Robinson wants to catch passes coming out of the 
backfield, Green looked slightly quicker and more polished Saturday than 
freshmen backs Delon Washington and Rodney Sermons. 
</P>
<P>
 Player and coach enthusiasm seemed high on a long Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Everything considered, Robinson seemed happy with the first day, but reserved 
further comment until Wednesday, when the Trojans lace up their pads for the 
first time.  
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Mike Garrett said of the Trojans' highly regarded freshman 
class: "Before, we'd play our opponents and hope to catch them on a bad day. 
Where we want to be talent-wise is having an attitude that we don't care if the 
other team plays well or not -- we're going to beat them anyway."

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It probably began with George Kase. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, Psycho," linebacker Mitch Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, me and Rod Smalley and the defensive line," Kase, alias Psycho, said 
Saturday as the afternoon sun glinted off his bald head. 
</P>
<P>
 Kase, a nose guard, and Smalley, an inside linebacker, had the hair clippers 
and plenty of help in a Friday night raid of the Dykstra Hall rooms of the UCLA 
freshmen. When they were finished, the new players had reason to keep their 
helmets on when fall practice began Saturday in Westwood. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the aches and pains of two-a-day practice sessions, they didn't need 
to add sunburned scalps. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kase, Smalley and a growing party of instant barbers decided that bald 
freshmen weren't enough. "They said if I got my hair done, the rest of the 
offense would follow," said short-haired quarterback Wayne Cook, who didn't 
much like the idea. "They had about 20 guys in my room, and there wasn't much I 
could do." 
</P>
<P>
 By Saturday morning, some strange hairdos, many of them compromises, were 
shown, including Troy Aldrich's Mohawk, Rob Walker's top knot and Sale Isaia's 
ponytail growing out of an otherwise bald head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Solidarity," said Kase, pointing out his motive and declaring war on some 
players who escaped the hair party. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One thing you will see only at practice: a passing-drill series in which the 
defensive backfield consisted of Javelin Guidry, Glenn Thompkins, Shaun 
Williams and DuVal Hicks, all freshmen. . . . After the first 11-on-11 play of 
the first practice, Coach Terry Donahue stepped in to remind the players they 
were in shorts and jerseys with helmets and no pads, and that it was a 
non-contact drill. A couple of players had decided football, in any form, meant 
hitting. . . . Non-scholarship wide receiver Kevin Walker is the new holder for 
All-American kicker Bjorn Merten. . . . Most likely to be redshirted: freshman 
quarterback Steve Buck. JIM HODGES

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; FOREMAN'S NEXT OPPONENT: THE WBA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Foreman had finished a run along the beach and, with his heart and 
anger pumping, was not feeling like a man too old to fight for the heavyweight 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Too old to fight? Foreman growled at the question, and promised that he will 
battle as hard as it takes -- in court if necessary -- to prove that, as he 
says, "I have a right to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman acknowledges being 45 or older. His scheduled bout against champion 
Michael Moorer on Nov. 5 was wiped out this week by the World Boxing Assn., 
which refused to sanction Foreman as a legitimate challenger. 
</P>
<P>
 A WBA attorney has said the organization feared for Foreman's safety, and 
added that in a boxing atmosphere chilled by the recent death of Robert Wangila 
after a Las Vegas fight, precautions must be heightened. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to fight this," Foreman said Friday from the house he rented in 
Malibu to prepare for the Moorer fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't go on that, that I'm 45 and could get hurt. If you're 25 years 
old or if you're 45, the concern has to be equal, unless there are other 
medical reasons. And I was checked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't be fearful. You can't just say, 'Well, he's 45, he can't 
fight.' 
</P>
<P>
 "And I just can't stick my head in the ground and say, 'Oh, I guess I am too 
old for this.' I'm young. I'm not an old man. People come up to me, they say, 
'George, you're getting up there.' But I'm not getting up there. I can fight. 
I've never met a boxer who can outdo me in the gym, on the road, anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it were just George Foreman being affected, you might say, 'Hey, I'll 
leave this alone, I've got a dollar or two . . .' But this is not just about 
me. If I don't fight this, then we're telling people if you're over 30, you're 
dead as an athlete. That's not right." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman plans to stay in the Los Angeles area while his attorney, Henry 
Holmes, pursues legal avenues -- against either the WBA or the Moorer camp, 
with whom Foreman had a contract. That contract stipulated that in order for 
the fight to take place, it had to be sanctioned by the WBA and the 
International Boxing Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman's camp argues that Moorer's camp did not fight the WBA aggressively 
enough on the sanctioning issue. The IBF, after a medical examination of 
Foreman last week in New York, had approved the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman's promoter, Bob Arum, said he is considering suing the Moorer camp and 
promoter Dan Duva for breach of contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman scoffs at the WBA's apparent concern for his health -- especially 
because Joe Hipp probably will replace Foreman as Moorer's opponent for the 
November fight. The WBA attorney, Jimmy Binns, was quoted as saying that 
Foreman's loss to Tommy Morrison last year was evidence that his skills had 
eroded dangerously. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's strange," Foreman said. "I lost to Tommy Morrison in a decision and 
Joe Hipp got creamed by Tommy Morrison (in a ninth-round technical knockout on 
June 27, 1992). And Joe Hipp's OK to fight and I'm not. Strange. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to know, who is this WBA guy? I heard he's an attorney who never 
had one day of medical training. Can you just say things like that if you're a 
lawyer? What, does he have my DNA or something?" 
</P>
<P>
 Others in Foreman's camp have suggested that this isn't about health concerns 
at all, that as always in boxing, politics has everything to do with it. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreman believes Moorer, after listening to how serious Foreman sounded during 
their media tour, was looking for a way out of the bout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they got scared," Foreman said. "I showed Michael Moorer up. I think 
I showed the whole camp up. So I think they found a way out, with an 
organization that you can't even find in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 John Davimos, Moorer's manager, laughed at that, saying Moorer would have 
loved to fight Foreman but was not going to risk having his title taken by the 
WBA. 
</P>
<P>
 "What did they want us to do?" Davimos asked. "Get stripped for George 
Foreman? Are they crazy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Others around Foreman point to Don King's hidden influence, noting that if 
Moorer had gone ahead with the bout and his title was taken away by the WBA, 
the next five heavyweights in line in the WBA rankings are all King's fighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "You realize things are very political," Foreman said. "I've been dealing with 
the politics of boxing since the early '70s, so I know they exist. Then all of 
a sudden it hits you, hey, certain times politics shouldn't get up and ruin 
things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am like Patrick Henry. I am fighting for liberty. And liberty does not end 
because of a birthday. It doesn't say, 'Life, liberty and the pursuit of 
happiness until you turn 40.' " Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Before Saturday night's bout, ruled a no-contest against Buster Mathis Jr., 
Riddick Bowe went back to conditioner Mackie Shilstone, who had worked with 
Bowe before he beat Evander Holyfield for the title. Bowe and Shilstone then 
had a breakup. But Bowe's recent back problems -- which caused the cancellation 
of two bouts -- appear to have convinced Bowe about Shilstone for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I had something like a herniated disk," Bowe said recently. "Mackie's 
helping me use muscles I've never used before, strengthening the weak spots." 
Bowe acknowledged that he was "very anxious" heading into the fight. "This has 
been the longest inactive period of my professional career. I want to go out 
there, make a little noise and let people know I am the best heavyweight out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Angel Gonzalez, the World Boxing Council lightweight champion, who drew 
more than 10,000 in Mexico for his last title defense, has asked the Forum to 
try to match him with Oscar De La Hoya. . . . Why did Pernell Whitaker, after 
months of saying Buddy McGirt didn't deserve a rematch, agree to fight McGirt 
on Oct. 1 on HBO at Virginia Beach? Because the only fight Whitaker really 
wants is a rematch with Julio Cesar Chavez, who is unavailable. Chavez will be 
fighting Meldrick Taylor on Sept. 17 at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than Chavez, what other opponent is there for Whitaker, who has proved 
himself beyond doubt? Maybe IBF welterweight champion Felix Trinidad, but he, 
like Chavez, is promoted by Don King. So, with HBO and the New York media 
pushing hard for the New York-based McGirt, the agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest beneficiary of the Moorer-Foreman cancellation might be the 
still-in-planning James Toney-Roy Jones super-middleweight showdown. Promoter 
Bob Arum has it scheduled as a pay-per-view bout on Nov. 19, but hasn't found a 
site. Because the MGM Grand was set to hold Moorer-Foreman on Nov. 5, the 
hotel-casino wasn't interested in another bout only two weeks later. But with 
the MGM Grand apparently ready to take a pass on Moorer-Hipp, suddenly 
Toney-Jones becomes its best bet for a winter fight. Calendar 
</P>
<P>
 Monday: Marco Antonio Barrera vs. Israel Gonzalez, super-bantamweights; Sammy 
Fuentes vs. Gilberto Flores, junior-welterweights; Forum, 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday: Rodney Toney vs. Bastante Blanco, middleweights; Irvine Marriott, 
7:30 p.m.

TENNIS / ELLIOTT ALMOND; 'STUPID SYSTEM' BLAMED FOR NAVRATILOVA'S DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Reeling from the loss of Martina Navratilova in the third round of the 
Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, tournament director Jerry Diamond took exception 
to the way women's tennis organizes its events. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martina lost to the system, the stupid system that requires players (to) play 
a 56 (player) draw because they want to make room for the 190th player in the 
world (to) make an $800 paycheck," said Diamond, a past director of the Women's 
Tennis Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's crazy. It doesn't make any sense." 
</P>
<P>
 Navratilova was by far the biggest draw in Diamond's week-long event at the 
Manhattan Country Club in Manhattan Beach. Adding to the lure was her impending 
retirement after the Virginia Slims Championships in New York in November. 
</P>
<P>
 As an eight-time winner of the tournament, Navratilova was hoping to say 
farewell to Los Angeles in style by reaching today's final. Instead, after 
playing almost five hours of grueling tennis Wednesday night -- she had a 
three-set singles victory and then played doubles -- she returned to the court 
Thursday afternoon exhausted. Navratilova, 37, lost in three sets to No. 46 Ann 
Grossman. 
</P>
<P>
 With a 56-player draw, the top players must compete five days during the week 
if they reach the final. Diamond said if they reduced the draw to 28, the 
sport's stars would have a better chance to recover during the week. The 
lesser-ranked players would still have a chance because the qualifying field 
would be expanded to include all 56. 
</P>
<P>
 And tournament directors would not be left with a weakened field for the 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're killing the top players," Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Davies, general manager of the International Tennis Federation in London, 
said no system will please everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, if you give the top players a bye, they have one less match to 
play and they are protected a little bit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other reasons to keep the field at 56 for the Tour's Tier 1 
($750,000) and Tier 2 ($400,000) events. 
</P>
<P>
 The tournaments are scheduled when a maximum number of players want to 
compete, said Ann Person Worcester, managing director of the Women's Tennis 
Council in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 With the U.S. Open two weeks away, all players want the chance to hone their 
skills against the best competition possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Also) we have about 500 players on the computer (rankings)," Worcester said. 
"So, giving 56 players jobs is kind of a minimum." 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond suggests the sport is run by the "also-rans" who want to play every 
week because they lose in the first or second rounds. For them, fatigue is not 
a factor. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't care because they get a paycheck every week," he said. "But the 
sport can't support that many players. It is ridiculous to have anybody in this 
tournament ranked above 125." 
</P>
<P>
 Diamond had 15. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 159, Mercedes Paz of Argentina, a member of the Women's Tennis Assn. board 
of directors, dismissed such sentiment. She said today's tour is so 
competitive, the lower-ranked players deserve berths. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, when Grossman defeats Navratilova one day and Amy Frazier upsets No. 3 
Conchita Martinez the next, as was the case in Los Angeles, it does appear the 
competition is tightening. 
</P>
<P>
 "The players here, they don't want to play on the farm clubs," said Diamond, 
who thinks a minor league system is needed. "They want the big-time right now. 
You tell them they are not good enough for the big-time, they say, 'Well, I 
know, but I want a shot at it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 And because of that, Diamond says, the fans lose. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now the people who bought tickets for the weekend are cheated out of seeing 
Martina because she had to play two nights in a row and she ran out of steam," 
Diamond said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does that benefit the sport?" 
</P>
<P>
 It is a question that needs to be addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to make the game more relevant, the ATP recently passed several 
measures to speed up play and allow more fan involvement. Not all the players 
are receptive to the changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they want to make it more attractive, have nude girls on the tennis 
court," Boris Becker said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most controversial rule reduces the time between points from 25 to 20 
seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking so much about the (20) seconds that I couldn't think about the 
serve," Becker said of his play at the recent Los Angeles Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-ranked Pete Sampras was not so concerned. He said in a statement, "I think 
that there is too much toweling off and there are too many other delays." 
</P>
<P>
 In another change, spectators will be allowed to react during points, as long 
as they do not intend to distract players. Andre Agassi, a crowd favorite, 
welcomes the participation.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think giving the crowd a little bit more freedom to support the players 
they want to support or cheer against the players they don't like is what 
sports is all about," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, spectators seated above the lowest tier of seats near the court will be 
allowed to move freely in and out of the stadium during play. Chair umpires 
will no longer delay play for spectator movement in the upper tier, unless it 
is meant to distract players. 
</P>
<P>
 "To take 15 extra seconds waiting to serve because somebody is not seated 
straight up and down in their chair is a little bit ridiculous," Agassi said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With a dearth of stars on the women's tour, and no sponsor for next season, 
the sport seems to be going through a transition. But as Navratilova retires 
and Monica Seles and Jennifer Capriati remain on the sidelines, others are 
filling the void. 
</P>
<P>
 As evidenced at the Virginia Slims of Los Angeles, dramatic, entertaining 
tennis still is being played. The names simply might not be recognizable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just that the young players are going to have to realize they have to 
take over and control the sport that they get money from," said Zina 
Garrison-Jackson, who at 32 is nearing the end of her career. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have to understand that it's not just about being on the court, that you 
have to do things you don't want to do." 
</P>
<P>
 She said such players as Mary Joe Fernandez, Arantxa Sanchez Vicario and 
Conchita Martinez must emerge as the next generation of personalities. Tennis

PGA CHAMPIONSHIP / DAILY REPORT; NORMAN NEEDS BIG COMEBACK TO WIN TODAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been close but no PGA for Greg Norman, who twice has come tantalizingly 
close. 
</P>
<P>
 He lost last year's PGA Championship when Paul Azinger beat him in a playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, he squandered a four-shot lead with nine holes to go and finished 
second to Bob Tway. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman needs to make up five shots in a hurry today if he is going to have any 
chance at winning his first PGA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I'm going to have to shoot something low," he said. "Anything below 
65, they'll look at. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know I've got a chance. I know I've played well. As far as I'm concerned, 
I'm playing for a win tomorrow. I'm not playing for second." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Jay Haas remembered some good advice he once got from his uncle, Bob Goalby. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to qualify for the national junior and I was a lock for it, but 
I shot an 85," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My uncle came by and asked he what I shot. I said 'I shot 85' and he said, 
'Well, it won't be the last time you shoot 80.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Here I was expecting some kind of pep talk. But, you know, he was right." 
</P>

 Falling stars: First-round co-leader Colin Montgomerie shot 76 Friday and 70 
Saturday and is tied for 34th. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Couples, one shot off the lead after the first round, is tied for 59th 
after back-to-back rounds of 74 and 75. THOMAS BONK

MANAGER TURNS OTHER CHEEK, IS SUSPENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The manager of the Bellingham Mariners was suspended and fined for "mooning" 
an umpire during a Northwest League baseball game last week, league president 
Bob Richmond said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Goff pulled the top of his pants down at home plate while protesting a 
fair-ball call on a hit by the Southern Oregon Athletics Tuesday night in 
Medford, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident was shown Wednesday night on ESPN. 
</P>
<P>
 Richmond recommended to the parent Seattle Mariners that Goff be allowed to 
return to work Monday night, after being suspended Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mariners had suspended him indefinitely pending a league decision, Dave 
Aust, Seattle Mariners public relations director said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're definitely not going to condone what he did," Aust said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We obviously can't have that kind of behavior," Richmond said. "I don't like 
it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 He declined to give the amount of the fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Goff and Mariners officials could not be reached by telephone for comment 
Saturday.

RAM NOTEBOOK; RUBLEY INJURY LEAVES TEAM WITH DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS and MIKE REILLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Team doctors met with Ram quarterback T.J. Rubley before Saturday night's game 
and decided he would rest his sore arm for another two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical decision will force the Rams to decide whether to keep Rubley when 
they trim the roster to 60 players on Aug. 23 without having watched him 
perform in exhibition play. 
</P>
<P>
 An MRI test Thursday revealed no structural damage to Rubley's elbow, ruling 
out the need for immediate surgery. Rubley has reported improvement in his arm, 
but said his hand remains swollen and his forearm sore. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflammation in Rubley's throwing arm and hand have plagued him since March. 
After attempting to compete in training camp, Rubley was forced to the sideline 
two weeks ago, unable even to hold the ball in his hand. Coaches -- who were 
unaware of Rubley's arm injury -- had become critical of his performance during 
the off-season and early stages of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 If the team decides to place him on injured reserve, they lose his services 
for the entire season, and he would not be allowed to practice with the team.  
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams release Rubley with an injury they lose his rights, although he 
would earn his salary until pronounced healthy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams also will have the option of carrying Rubley on their final 53-man 
roster, which would allow them to use him when he recovers. But can they afford 
to carry both a healthy Jamie Martin and an injured Rubley as the No. 3 
quarterback? Probably not. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams announced a last-minute change in their defensive starting lineup -- 
a change some predicted would come just before the regular-season opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Kelly, who left the Raiders to sign with the Rams during the off-season, 
replaced linebacker Henry Rolling to start Saturday night's game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Rookie strong safety Toby Wright, a second-round pick out of Nebraska, all but 
guaranteed himself full-time employment with two big hits on kickoff and punt 
coverages. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright made a diving stop on the opening kickoff, then teamed with Marquez 
Pope to level New England wide receiver Kevin Lee on a punt return early in the 
second quarter. Lee suffered a broken jaw on the play. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright has been backing up starting strong safety Deral Boykin while learning 
the Rams' defense in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Leadership skills: Quarterback Chris Miller completed all five of his pass 
attempts for 51 yards, but perhaps his best effort Saturday night didn't show 
up in the statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 After tailback David Lang's second-quarter fumble set up New England's first 
touchdown, the first person to greet him on the sideline was Miller, offering 
words of encouragement and trying to show the leadership from his position that 
was lacking last season with Jim Everett. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Coming on: Rookie wide receiver Chris Brantley, a fourth-round pick from 
Rutgers, began to show signs of promise in the second quarter. Brantley 
returned a punt 11 yards and caught two passes for 51 yards, including a 
39-yard reception from Chris Chandler that set up Tony Zendejas' 41-yard field 
goal as time expired in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Add Brantley: The rookie was one of a handful of Ram players to have big plays 
wiped out by penalties. The Rams had seven penalties for 56 yards in the first 
half, including four penalties on rookie left tackle Wayne Gandy for lining up 
off the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Gandy penalties wiped out a 28-yard catch by Brantley and a 13-yard catch by 
Johnny Bailey, and a holding penalty on guard Chuck Belin nullified a 10-yard 
run by Jerome Bettis.

BACK AT BACK; USC'S BARNUM RETURNS TO OFFENSE AFTER 2 LEAN YEARS AS A 
CORNERBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC tailback Terry Barnum weaves through the line and breaks free for a long 
touchdown run. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Usher, happens to be standing behind that end zone, smiling from 
ear to ear. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly, they walk toward each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a long time, hasn't it?" Usher asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yup," his son answers. "Too long." 
</P>
<P>
 It was April, and it was only spring practice. But to Barnum, the former 
Alemany High standout, it seemed like a lifetime since he even carried a 
football, much less score a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 In the beginning, Barnum was just like every other kid who grew up dreaming of 
playing football for USC. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted to be the impact player, the All-American, the Heisman Trophy 
winner. 
</P>
<P>
 In other words, Barnum wanted to be the tailback. 
</P>
<P>
 What else could you be at Tailback U? Years of watching Charles White, Marcus 
Allen and Student Body Right seduced him. Barnum even committed to USC early, 
before his senior season at Alemany High in 1991.  
</P>
<P>
 He knew where he wanted to go and he didn't want to waste time getting there. 
</P>
<P>
 But only now has he finally gotten a real chance to make his childhood dream a 
reality.  
</P>
<P>
 After spending his first two years at USC as a reserve cornerback, Barnum, a 
junior, is No. 3 on the depth chart at tailback as preseason drills began 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a long and frustrating struggle for Barnum, who was converted back 
to tailback after talking with USC Coach John Robinson before spring drills 
began last April. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who has vowed to improve on the Trojans' paltry rushing totals of 
last season, was impressed by Barnum during the spring.  
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-10, 180-pounder might even play fullback this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave him a shot and he's done very well," Robinson said. "He's an 
excellent receiver, extremely smart, smart in the classroom . . . just a smart 
man. So we may use him (this season)." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnum should have known what he was in for when he was switched to defense 
during his first practice as a Trojan in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 To him, defense was always an afterthought on the football field. But he 
didn't mind, as long as he got a chance to play. 
</P>
<P>
 So instead of going for the Heisman Trophy, Barnum thought, "Fine, I'll be the 
next Thorpe (an award given annually to the best defensive back in college 
football) winner." 
</P>
<P>
 During that first practice, reality set in for the eager freshman when Barnum 
was run over by Curtis Conway, now a wide receiver for the Chicago Bears. He 
quickly realized it was not going to be as easy as he first thought. 
</P>
<P>
 In his first two years, Barnum was on the field for four defensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
 His only significant playing time came on special teams, appearing in 11 games 
as a sophomore and making six tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 The odds were stacked against Barnum from the outset. In front of him at 
cornerback last season were Jason Sehorn and Jason Oliver.  
</P>
<P>
 Sehorn went on to be drafted by the New York Giants in the second round, and 
Oliver already had 10 starts under his belt in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was having to learn to play defense on the college level, which was going 
to take some time," he said. "It's not the easiest place to learn to play 
defense." 
</P>
<P>
 As times became tougher, Barnum leaned on his family, especially his father, 
for support. After every practice, no matter how Barnum did, he could always 
find comfort when he saw Usher waiting for him on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been a big part of me getting through this," Barnum said. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the frustration of not playing mounted, it got to the point where 
Barnum didn't want to talk about football, especially his playing time. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hurt too bad," Usher said. "The most difficult part of it was that he was 
mentally and physically ready to play every week. Doing that 13 times a season 
(and not playing) is a difficult thing to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnum's frustrations came to a head whenever he saw former high school 
opponents on television get playing time at other schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough because it started to play on his confidence and talent," said 
Barnum's girlfriend, Brenda Quintana.  
</P>
<P>
 "He started to think he wasn't NCAA Division I material. He was always wanting 
to play so badly, but he was always standing on the sidelines." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Usher: "I think the frustration of not playing tailback was not as big as 
not playing at all. That was pretty much the low point in his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Barnum figured the only way he was going to get a chance to play again was if 
he went back to offense, where he is more comfortable. Robinson relented, and 
Barnum was impressive. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a tremendous game," White said. "His skills were a little rusty, but 
from the spring to what I've seen in the first day of practice, he's got some 
stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 White should know. The former San Fernando High football and track standout 
was the 1979 Heisman Trophy winner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a bright guy," added White, USC's running backs coach since last season. 
"He's just had to bring his old shoes out of the closet. It'll come with time."

SHE'S NOT IN IT FOR A NET GAIN; AVID FAN SUFFERS SLINGS, ARROWS AS A LOW-PAID 
TENNIS UMPIRE, BUT LOVES EACH VICARIOUS MINUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lois Goodman has received dirty looks from John McEnroe. She has been the 
target of Jim Courier's sexist remarks and has heard enough bickering among the 
world's best tennis players to lose track of who said what. 
</P>
<P>
 And the 52-year-old Calabasas resident loves it. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman, an avid tennis fan for most of her life, got a job 15 years ago that 
allowed her to stand on the court with the world's top players. She became an 
umpire. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the years she has seen the sport's biggest names up close: Jimmy 
Connors, McEnroe, Chris Evert, Martina Navratilova. And the list goes on.  
</P>
<P>
 Last week she worked at the Virginia Slims of Manhattan Beach, where she 
officiated about five matches a day at the Manhattan Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the week she served as a linesman for a first-round match between 
this year's Wimbledon champion, Conchita Martinez, and two-time NCAA singles 
champion Lisa Raymond of the University of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
 No biggie. Goodman has served as an official at the U.S. Open and Australian 
Open for eight years and the 1991 Davis Cup in Hawaii. She also works at the 
men's annual Volvo tournament at UCLA and is a regular at NCAA matches. She 
does about 15 tournaments a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's exciting," Goodman said. "This is my favorite sport and I'm out there 
rubbing shoulders with the best players. There's no real way to describe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working (the Virginia Slims) is great. The players are wonderful and they're 
courteous and they appreciate good officiating." 
</P>
<P>
 But that isn't always the case. Goodman also deals with athletes who make rude 
comments and fans who often taunt her. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't let anything bother you," Goodman said. "And you can't take 
anything personally. If you do, you're in big trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman won't mention the name, but said a top male player once told her she 
should be "at home having babies."  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of men players feel women should not be calling men's matches," Goodman 
said. "Jim Courier has made no secret about the fact that he doesn't like women 
umpires.  
</P>
<P>
 "He has said publicly that women should not call lines in men's matches. Well, 
right after he said that he got almost all women umpires in one of his matches 
and he noticed it and said, 'Look at all the lady umpires. This must be on my 
behalf.' That was fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the men, however, are polite and respectful. Goodman says Pete 
Sampras, the world's No. 1 player, is always that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's wonderful," she said. "He is always quiet and he really doesn't show 
much emotion. It's great because with a lot of the men, you just never know 
what they're going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Even Stefan Edberg, the mellow Swede who rarely displays emotion, made a 
sarcastic gesture after losing a match in which Goodman called him for 
foot-faulting three times. 
</P>
<P>
 "He turned to me and bowed a couple of times, waving his hands like, 'Thank 
you very much. I lost because of you,' " Goodman said. "You just have to laugh 
at things like that. We're just out there doing our job." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman says women's matches are easier to officiate. They are usually cordial 
and respectful, and their method of disputing a call is mild compared to most 
men, she says. 
</P>
<P>
 "You look at players like Chris Evert and Martina, that's class with a capital 
C," Goodman said. "They are just gracious. With most women we never have any 
problems because they are more mature." 
</P>
<P>
 Fans usually aren't, Goodman says, and they tend to side against officials, 
though on one occasion the crowd agreed with her. 
</P>
<P>
 Andre Agassi had served what he thought was an ace. Goodman called it out. 
</P>
<P>
 "He carried on and complained and complained," Goodman said. "Then he came 
back to the line where I was standing and asked the crowd behind me how they 
saw the ball. Everyone yelled that the ball was out and he got real mad but he 
came up to me and said, 'I stand corrected. I apologize.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to smile but we're not even allowed to. We're supposed to have a 
deadpan face." 
</P>
<P>
 Umpires can't interact with players or fans and they must get permission from 
a supervisor before speaking to the media.  
</P>
<P>
 One night, however, at the end of an exhibition match between Navratilova and 
Connors at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, Goodman broke policy. 
</P>
<P>
 As the match proceeded, several unruly fans behind her kept saying her calls 
were so off she must have cataracts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, at the end I looked up at them and said, 'Not only can I see well, I 
can hear well too!' They were very embarrassed," Goodman said. "They couldn't 
believe I heard them or that I would say anything." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And it's not as if Goodman is raking in big bucks to take all this abuse. 
Umpires make $60 to $120 a day depending on how big the event is and often that 
means 10 to 12 hours of work.  
</P>
<P>
 "You have to be able to afford to be an umpire," Goodman said. "You do it for 
the love of it. I really think it complements my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodman and her husband have owned an auto parts business in Los Angeles for 
32 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple and their three daughters lived in Tarzana for more than 20 years 
before moving to Calabasas.  
</P>
<P>
 Goodman began playing tennis socially at the age of 20 and was a regular at 
the Braemar Country Club in Reseda. 
</P>
<P>
 That's where she got into officiating. A fellow club member was recruiting 
prospective umpires and Goodman signed up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now she's one of the most-dedicated umpires out there," said umpire Sylvia 
Watts, who flew from her home in England to work at the Virginia Slims. "She 
obviously enjoys it a great deal and she has the perfect personality for it 
because she has a great sense of humor." 
</P>
<P>
 How else could she take all the complaining and criticism that comes with such 
a low-paying job? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult and thankless job," Goodman said. "Players always thank 
volunteers and ball kids but they never thank the umpires. Never!" 
</P>
<P>
 And rarely do they apologize for sexist comments or dirty looks.

DODD, WHITMARSH DIG WAY INTO FINAL; VOLLEYBALL: DEFENDING CHAMPIONS REACH 
TODAY'S FINAL AT SEAL BEACH BY BEATING KIRALY AND STEFFES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's no secret to any professional beach volleyball player what the strategy 
of Mike Dodd and Mike Whitmarsh will be when they step on the court. 
</P>
<P>
 And they will be the first to admit it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way we get points is off the block or dig because we won't get any off 
the serve," Whitmarsh said after a 12-7 victory over Karch Kiraly and Kent 
Steffes in the winners' bracket final at the Miller Lite Open beach volleyball 
tournament Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd and Whitmarsh will find out this morning whether they will face Kiraly 
and Steffes again or Randy Stoklos and Adam Johnson. Those two teams face off 
in the consolation final at 9 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The men's final will then follow around noon. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd and Whitmarsh, the defending Seal Beach champions, kept the the 
top-seeded duo of Kiraly and Steffes from staging any of their trademark 
rallies and held a lead the entire match. 
</P>
<P>
 "They couldn't get any rallies," Whitmarsh said. "It's really important to 
stay on top of them." 
</P>
<P>
 After Dodd and Whitmarsh jumped out to a 6-2 lead, Kiraly and Steffes put 
together their only challenge of the match, cutting the lead to one point 
before the second-seeded pair rolled off four in a row for a 10-5 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The highlight of the run was a fake spike by Dodd who then spun in the air 
and, with his back to the net, reeled off a backhand spike that landed on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd and Whitmarsh then were able to keep Kiraly and Steffes in the check 
until the rally clock expired. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Dodd, who will be 37 Saturday, said he is enjoying the twilight of his career 
more than he did his younger days on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really enjoying the second phase of my career," he said. "I have a new 
baby, a great family and a terrific partner." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was younger I would just party all night and then let 'Hov' (former 
partner Tim Hovland) scream at me all day," he said with a grin. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the women's semifinals, the fourth-seeded team of Sandra Pires and Jackie 
Silva advanced to the final with a 12-8 victory over defending champions Cammy 
Ciarelli and Holly McPeak. 
</P>
<P>
 The Brazilian pair will be looking for their second AVP tournament victory in 
a row when they face top-seeded Nancy Reno and Angela Rock this morning at 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Pires and Silva defeated Reno and Rock, 15-9, in the second round Saturday 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One player who left with more money in his pocket than usual is Matt Unger, 
who wound up in fifth place along with new partner Scott Friedrichsen. They 
will split $5,700. 
</P>
<P>
 Unger, whose previous highest AVP finish was ninth, delighted the crowd with 
his ability to hold his own at the net despite being only 5 feet 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Unger and Friedrichsen came into the tournament seeded 13th, but impressive 
victories over some talented teams, including No. 7 Bill (Beef) Boullianne and 
Eric Fonoimoana, had them playing late into the day. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Unger leaped above Boullianne to win a ball that was even with 
the net and the crowd roared with applause. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The team of Brian Gatzke and Jeff Rodgers also made an impressive leap from 
the 14th seeding all the way to fifth-place money. 
</P>
<P>
 Gatzke and Rodgers sent Stoklos and Johnson into the consolation bracket with 
a 14-11 victory Friday in the second round, forcing the third-seeded pair to 
win five consecutive matches Saturday to stay alive. 
</P>
<P>
 After Dodd and Whitmarsh sent Gatzke and Rodgers into the consolation bracket, 
15-5, Stoklos and Johnson got revenge and ended their dream run.

BIG RED MERCHANDISE; RUSSIAN HOCKEY TEAM TURNS TO CAPITALISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBYN NORWOOD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Viktor Tikhonov was once the very symbol of the Soviet hockey system, the Big 
Red Machine that dominated international competition for so many years. 
</P>
<P>
 As coach of the national team, he watched his players celebrate Olympic gold 
three times -- as well as mourn an ignominious defeat, the loss to the U.S. 
team at Lake Placid, N.Y., in 1980. His Central Red Army teams, made up of men 
whose service to their country was to train 11 months out of the year, won 13 
national championships. 
</P>
<P>
 But since the collapse of communism, Central Red Army -- once among the elite 
teams in the world -- has been sapped of much of its financial support and more 
critically, its best players. Young men such as Sergei Fedorov, Pavel Bure and 
Alexander Mogilny -- all once promising young Central Red Army players -- now 
make millions starring in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 By last March, it had come to this: Tikhonov, 63, sat in a Moscow meeting with 
a Walt Disney Co. official, discussing what sort of logo Disney should put on 
the chests of Central Red Army players. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the Central Red Army team -- or CSKA -- entered an unprecedented 
working agreement with American investors led by Pittsburgh Penguin owner 
Howard Baldwin. The group quickly renamed the team the Russian Penguins and 
worked capitalist magic with a new logo, creating an incongruous but marketable 
design -- a cartoonish penguin on skates wearing the army's red star and 
Cyrillic lettering on his jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 This June, Disney Sports Enterprises, flush with the success of the Mighty 
Duck logo after it led the NHL in sales -- bought a 32.5% interest in the group 
and set out to create still another logo. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Gilmore, who is director of hockey operations for the Ducks and is 
overseeing many aspects of the project, had a feeling before he entered the 
meetings in Moscow that something like 'Mighty Penguins of Moscow' was not what 
Tikhonov had in mind. 
</P>
<P>
 The team wanted to return to something more traditional, Tikhonov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditional? Gilmore asked him to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, something with red, white and blue, Tikhonov said. 
</P>
<P>
 And eagles. And a star. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmore almost fell out of his chair. What he'd just heard sounded like a 
cross between the Stars and Stripes and the Presidential seal. And had he 
looked at Tikhonov's biography, he would have seen that the coach was born on 
the Fourth of July. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thinking, 'Wrong country there, Viktor,' " Gilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Gilmore realized, the colors are those of the old Russian tricolor 
flag, which has replaced the hammer and sickle. And the double-headed eagle, he 
learned is another traditional symbol, as is the army star. So Walt Disney 
Imagineering, given the symbols of Russia's past as raw material, created an 
official-looking logo much as it might for an imaginary entity in one of its 
parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is that this one becomes semi-official because a real team will 
wear it. Naturally, the design will soon be available on T-shirts, jerseys, 
ball caps, pennants, water bottles and the like on at least two continents. The 
merchandise will be sold on the Russian team's U.S. tour and probably will find 
its way into many of the Ducks' outlets, if not the Disney parks as well. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement emphasizes merchandising -- it's the Disney way -- but it also 
brings other advantages. With travel within Russia and the other former Soviet 
republics now considered dangerous enough that the U.S. government has warned 
its employees against flying the local airlines, NHL teams are concerned about 
their ability to scout out the best talent. By affiliating with CSKA, the 
Penguins and Ducks have access to scouting input from not only Tikhonov, but 
also American employees who work in Russia as liaisons, such as Mark Kelley, 
who is the son of Penguin President Jack Kelley. 
</P>
<P>
 Another likelihood is that newly drafted players from the former Soviet Union 
might play for CSKA for a year before coming to North America. Less likely, but 
still possible, is that young North American players might play in Moscow. And 
just perhaps, Tikhonov might come to the U.S. to conduct clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney was brought into the deal, though, for the merchandising. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Jacobson, an editor at Sporting Goods Dealer magazine, said the 
popularity of the logos of expansion teams has led to a stream of what he calls 
"novel licenses," where companies try to take advantage of the appeal of 
virtually anything "new" related to sports. An example would be the designs 
pairing Warner Brothers characters with pro sports logos. 
</P>
<P>
 "One company even came up with logos from fake minor league teams, with weird 
towns or weird nicknames," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 CSKA is real, but it still has an otherworldly aura. Though the players wear a 
Coke patch on their uniforms and American pop music plays over the sound 
system, the atmosphere is not all-American. For one thing, tickets cost the 
equivalent of 25 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's this huge marketing opportunity, or merchandising opportunity," 
Gilmore said. "What you're doing is taking a team with so much tradition and 
you've got the ability to merchandise that, worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
 Having scored big with the youth market with the Duck logo, Disney is looking 
to attract older buyers with this one. Clearly, though, this is a tiny venture 
in comparison. Last year, sales of Russian Penguin paraphernalia reached about 
$250,000 during the team's U.S. tour. The Duck logo was the biggest seller 
among the 26 NHL teams, with the league total reaching an estimated $1 billion, 
according to the NHL, which will not release figures for individual teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the CSKA logo) is directed more toward hockey purists," Gilmore 
said. "You tell kids about CSKA and they won't know what you're talking about. 
But then, you hope not only to get the hockey purist, but kids who will buy the 
merchandise just for the look." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' involvement in Moscow gives Disney a tiny toehold in a vast new 
market -- and something else to put on T-shirts.

HOMEWISE: PROBLEMS WITH TOO MUCH, LITTLE MOISTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Special to The Times 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: I read somewhere it's recommended to set the bathroom fan to run 20 
minutes past your shower to make sure all the moisture is removed. The article 
also said to use the kitchen fan anytime you use the stove, because moisture 
trapped inside the house is bad. My problem is I have a terrible time with my 
house being too dry! I suffer from dry lips, throat, nose, etc. I was told to 
reduce these effects I should place bowls of water beside the furnace vents to 
add moisture to the air. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm now confused . . . should I be running fans to remove moisture or placing 
pans of water near the furnace vents to add moisture? Please set me straight. 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: Too much or too little moisture in the indoor air is a problem for 
many homeowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Dry air can lead to health problems, increased static electricity (oops, there 
goes the home computer!), cracking of furniture joints and finishes, and other 
problems. On the other hand, too much moisture in the air can cause other 
health problems, mold growth and severe structural damage. Moisture levels 
should generally be maintained between 30% to 60% relative humidity. 
</P>
<P>
 Two major factors determine whether the indoor air is too dry or too moist; 
the amount of moisture being generated indoors -- or entering the house from 
the outside or soil, and the amount of moisture that escapes or is ventilated 
out of the home. 
</P>
<P>
 The average family of four generates about two to three gallons of water vapor 
per day from activities such as bathing, laundry, breathing of occupants, dish 
washing, etc. Since most existing houses were not fully air-sealed during 
construction, this moisture quickly leaks out and is replaced by cooler, drier 
air -- creating the dry-air conditions that you're experiencing. 
</P>
<P>
 Houses built tightly, or subsequently weatherized (air-sealed), allow the 
occupants to control indoor moisture levels because the houses are able to 
retain the moisture. If the moisture builds up too much, the occupants simply 
turn on an exhaust fan. The amount of time fans need to run depends upon the 
fan size and the amount of moisture needing to be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 In your situation, you are either producing too little moisture through your 
day-to-day activities -- or the moisture is being lost to the outside through 
the use of the bath fan and kitchen range hood, or by air leakage through the 
building shell. Air leaks in the furnace duct system can also contribute to 
loss of moisture. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming you're generating a typical amount of moisture, you shouldn't 
immediately add lots of additional moisture. Instead, attempt to retain the 
moisture to a "leaky" house can have some severe consequences -- moist air that 
leaks into walls and ceilings can condense and cause insulation to become damp 
and lose some of its insulation value. Moisture in these areas can also cause 
exterior paint to peel, siding to warp and lead to rot and structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, don't automatically run the bath fan and kitchen range hood. Let some of 
the moisture recirculate through the house (your thermostat may have a "fan 
only" switch that will let you use the furnace blower to help mix the air). 
You'll discover it's easy to regulate the moisture level in your house by 
balancing fan operation with moisture production. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaks in furnace duct systems can dry out your home and are extremely wasteful 
from an energy standpoint. Check your ductwork to ensure all the connections 
are secure and the joints and seams are sealed. If the ducts are not sealed or 
insulated, you should upgrade as soon as possible. Energy savings will often 
pay for the cost of the materials in a very short time. Seal all the joints and 
seams, including where the ducts meet the floor at the registers. Use an 
approved brush-on sealant instead of duct tape. Insulate the ducts after 
sealing is complete.

MERCHANTS, CITY HOPE TO REVIVE PROSPEROUS PAST OF OLVERA STREET; BUSINESS: A 
NEWLY APPOINTED COMMISSION BEGINS WORK ON REVERSING THE DECLINE OF THE DOWNTOWN 
HISTORICAL LANDMARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Vivien Bonzo and other Olvera Street merchants have waited more than two years 
to bring new life to the city's birthplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they have that chance. After a long delay, a commission has been appointed 
to oversee the historic El Pueblo de Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to turn it into a Universal Studios," said Bonzo, president of 
the Olvera Street Merchants Assn. "We want it to be real. We want to promote 
the (historical) qualities that are inherent here." 
</P>
<P>
 The 18-year owner of La Golondrina restaurant plans to go over a five-page 
wish list with the new El Pueblo de Los Angeles Historical Monument Authority 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Her concerns and those of the 76 other Olvera Street merchants have piled up 
because it has taken more than two years for the mayor's office to make 
appointments to the commission, which will take over operation, management and 
maintenance at El Pueblo from the city's Department of Parks and Recreation.  
</P>
<P>
 Five of the seven commissioners were confirmed by the City Council Tuesday, 
while the remaining two are scheduled to appear before the council by the end 
of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I want to do is quickly start meeting with the merchants," said Lydia 
Lopez, speaking for the commission. "There's a lot of sorting out to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants and commissioners agree that the fledgling commission will have much 
to learn in the next few months about the two-block Downtown area where 11 
families founded Los Angeles in 1781. The El Pueblo Authority will also need to 
understand the history and political squabbles behind the Mexican-flavored 
marketplace known as Olvera Street and the vacant undeveloped landmarks at the 
south end of the monument, such as the Pico Hotel and the Garnier Building. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners and merchants alike say they want to see a detailed plan for the 
historic park and to develop ways to promote El Pueblo as a multicultural 
center highlighting the history of its Mexican, European, Asian and African 
American settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 But some sticking points will have to be smoothed over once the commission 
takes over operations. 
</P>
<P>
 A key issue is that of the Pico and Garnier buildings south of the park, Bonzo 
and other merchants said. The Pico Hotel was built by Don Pio Pico, the last 
Mexican governor of California. The first three-story building in Los Angeles, 
it opened for business on June 9, 1870. At the two-story Garnier building, 
Chinese businesses set up shop and Chinese community groups formed in the mid- 
to late 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonzo has been opposed to any major commercial or office development in that 
area. Instead, she prefers to renovate the historic buildings as cultural 
centers or museums. 
</P>
<P>
 But Peter Martinez, president of another merchants group, Business Leadership 
of Olvera Street, wants to draw the business crowd by turning some of those 
buildings into office space and by offering a variety of non-Mexican-style 
restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to stay competitive with the other theme parks around Southern 
California," said the owner of Margarita's Gift Shop and Lozen's Trading Post. 
"It's like Universal CityWalk, where you've got Tony Roma's and all sorts of 
selection of foods." 
</P>
<P>
 "Olvera Street has its own character. . . . You're (still) going to draw 
people to the area," he said. "I'd rather have those buildings be occupied than 
empty." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the commissioners polled about this issue said they need more time to 
listen to both sides. But some did agree to try to find ways to merge 
commercial and historical interests, if possible, to create a more attractive 
El Pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the two merchant leaders disagree on development, both have claimed 
that the monument has suffered from mismanagement and neglect by the parks 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, however, has gone so far as to ask for the removal of El Pueblo 
director Anthony Gonzales. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first point (commissioners) should address, if anything, is to either 
remove or transfer some of the staff we have right now," he said. Gonzales 
"hasn't cared in three years. He's not going to care now." 
</P>
<P>
 The merchant and his wife, Emily Martinez, say the streets are dirty and 
Olvera Street maintenance staff are lax about picking up trash. The couple also 
questioned the nearly $1.6 million Gonzales budgeted this year for staff 
salaries and benefits -- more than half the total 1994-95 budget of $2.4 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales said the 45 full-time and 20 to 25 part-time staff are doing the best 
job they can with the resources they have. The staff includes attendants at 
five parking lots, and clerical and maintenance workers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the landlord and they're the tenant," he said. "It's how the person views 
the cup, half-empty or half-full." 
</P>
<P>
 Gonzales intends to provide all the information that commissioners may request 
about budget or staff supervision. "Based on the information, they will make 
the decisions," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have yet to determine exactly what role the commission will 
have in selecting staff and appointing a general manager. The panel will also 
have to review a recent city controller's audit report on El Pueblo that listed 
fund-raising problems and previous audit recommendations that have yet to be 
implemented. Those include the failure to recover $3,919 in overpayments to 
part-time employees and the need for cash registers at parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has also required the commission to find ways to renovate such 
buildings as the Italian Hall on the west end of the park and to establish a 
Chinese history museum to reflect the Asian influence in the early history of 
El Pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, merchants, city officials and commissioners hope to increase the 
average 1 million visitors to the monument, which has declined in the recession 
and since the 1992 riots. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't draw a lot of people as we used to because Los Angeles doesn't draw 
the people," said Rudy Madrid, 67, owner of Rudy's Gift Imports on Olvera 
Street.  
</P>
<P>
 Some even see the commission's future actions as a do-or-die effort to 
revitalize El Pueblo. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this (does not bring) an improvement, then you're writing a death 
certificate for Olvera Street," Bonzo said. "For many of us, it has to be an 
improvement. . . . This is our livelihood. This is our family history." 
</P>
<P>
 The commissioners are: Antonio Cardenas, 31, a Mission Hills real estate agent 
and Sylmar resident; Stewart Kwoh, 45, executive director of the Asian Pacific 
American Legal Center, of Silver Lake; Lydia Lopez, 52, of Lincoln Heights, 
owner of a fund-raising consulting firm; Josephine Ramirez, 36, of Venice, an 
arts consultant; and Andres Topacio, of Montecito Heights, owner of a Downtown 
architectural firm and a member of the California Hispanic Cultural Society.  
</P>
<P>
 Commission appointees who still must be confirmed by the City Council are 
Philip W. Bartenetti, a partner in the law firm of Clark & Trevithick, and Juan 
Gomez Quinones, a UCLA history professor, of Pacific Palisades.

PROGRAM TAKES THE HEALING ARTS INTO THE NEIGHBORHOODS; WORKSHOPS: LOCAL ARTISTS 
SPREAD THE WORD TO INNER-CITY YOUTHS ABOUT SONG, DANCE AND THEATER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While Los Angeles smoldered and burned-out lots stood suddenly fallow after 
the 1992 riots, Sheila Scott-Wilkinson got the chance to bring a long-held 
vision of hers to life. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Arts Council and the National Endowment for the Arts called on 
the film and television actress to begin working some kind of healing magic for 
the scarred city. 
</P>
<P>
 With a $60,000 grant, Wilkinson immediately began formulating on paper what 
had been in her head for years: a grass-roots series of arts workshops for 
youths that would employ as many local artists in as many parts of the inner 
city as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, hundreds of teen-agers around the city are not only sharing Wilkinson's 
vision but are shaping it into their own through song, dance, theater and a 
host of other art forms. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a long time, I had been seeing a tremendous need for high-quality arts 
programs in places like South-Central. Not enough artists even think about 
working there," said Wilkinson, her rapid words punctuated by an energy that 
rarely allows her to sit still. "They (the state and federal arts agencies) 
didn't really know what I was going to do," She laughed. "But I did."  
</P>
<P>
 An acting teacher who also operates Art Reach, an arts workshop for prisons 
and correctional youth facilities, Wilkinson had experience coordinating arts 
programs, though not on so grand a scale. She drove constantly throughout the 
city checking out potential sites and single-handedly assembled a summer 
Artists-in-Residence program. She placed artists for up to six weeks of 
workshops from Compton to Pico-Union that offered young people ages 12 to 18 
free training in theater, dance, visual arts, comedy, music, video production 
and creative writing.  
</P>
<P>
 The best part of the job, said Wilkinson, was turning places that don't 
usually house art happenings -- churches, libraries and community centers -- 
into meeting points for artists and the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of set up shop where the space was available or centrally located," 
said Wilkinson, herself an artist-in-residence at the William Grant Still 
center in the Crenshaw district. "And I talked a lot to artists and community 
people to see what program was needed or wanted most."  
</P>
<P>
 For Edward Grice, associate pastor at True Growth Inspiration Missionary 
Baptist Church in South-Central, the twice-weekly music and drumming workshops 
did more than intended. From the core of more than 20 arts students, Grice 
formed a teen round-table discussion group that meets once a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of shootings recently at Washington High School, and the 
teens wanted to address that on a regular basis," Grice said. "This was a great 
opportunity to do that. . . . Parents say part of the violence problem is that 
the kids have nothing to do, particularly in the summer. This (the arts 
program) satisfies everyone's needs."  
</P>
<P>
 Now in its third year, the program has expanded to 45 artists and includes 
Venice's Oakwood district -- on the same $60,000 shoestring budget. Despite 
that, Wilkinson has a strict policy of paying artists relatively high hourly 
wages to ensure she gets quality instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Artists get so preoccupied with the Hollywood scene, the established gallery 
scene, certain areas are neglected," said Wilkinson, whose stage and film 
credits include best-actress honors in a 1978 Jamaican film, Dramalogue critic 
awards for two local plays, and performances in London's National Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted this program to not only fulfill kids, but make the artists more 
complete by bringing them into the community and forcing them to deal directly 
with cultures other than their own."  
</P>
<P>
 While the program's teaching staff reflects the ethnic makeup of Central Los 
Angeles -- half are black, half are Latino and a few are Anglo -- all deal with 
students of other colors and cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 Master drummer Ernesto Salcedo teaches a universal language of rhythm during 
workshops, when attentive students perfectly mimic his beats on a variety of 
African, pre-Columbian, Native American and Latin American instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The drums tell myths and stories of cultures these kids have never been 
exposed to," said the East Los Angeles native of his African-American students. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "What's interesting is that I'm introducing them to an African heritage, their 
own heritage, that they don't really know."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: CHINATOWN; PHOTOGRAPHER PAYS TRIBUTE TO 4 WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One woman flew commercial planes for a living in the 1930s and '40s. 
</P>
<P>
 Another opened one of the first restaurants in Chinatown in 1946 and continued 
cooking meals there until she reached the age of 95. 
</P>
<P>
 A third helped lead the drive for a Chinatown branch library, which opened in 
1977. And a fourth devoted 25 years of her life as a teacher, assistant 
principal and principal on Los Angeles Unified School District campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their different occupations, these women can be considered four of a 
kind -- recognized in the Chinatown community as living Chinese American 
pioneers of their day. 
</P>
<P>
 Artist/photographer Carol Nye became so fascinated with the background and 
contributions of aviator Katherine Sui Fun Cheung, restaurateur Yiu Hai (Mama 
Quon) Seto, librarian Ruby Ling Louie and educator Ella Yee Quan that she 
initiated a public art project featuring the four. 
</P>
<P>
 Nye's work is on display outside the Metro Plaza Hotel, 658 N. Spring St. in 
Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Chinese American Women of Los Angeles," four large black-and-white 
photo murals are attached along the hotel facade. Each consists of a woman's 
portrait juxtaposed with images related to the subject. A brief biography of 
each woman is inscribed onto plaques below the murals. 
</P>
<P>
 The murals, which range in size from 8-by-10-foot to 13-by-10-foot, also 
include imprints of Chinese characters and English words identifying the four 
women, who all live in Chinatown except for Quan, a Highland Park resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Nye explained that she had four main objectives for the $13,000 city-funded 
exhibit: bring contemporary Asian American art to an area lacking a much-needed 
museum; raise community awareness about Chinese American women's contributions; 
provide role models for youths, and counter historical stereotypes that portray 
Asian women as "sensual objects or housewives." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Chinese American culture, we don't have many role models," said the 
West Hills free-lance photographer, who was raised in Macau and now runs her 
own photo studio in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 And those who made significant contributions, like the four featured women, 
often maintained a low profile, Nye said. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist eventually learned about the four after interviewing Chinatown 
residents and reading the book, "Linking Our Lives," published by the Chinese 
Historical Society. She then contacted them for interviews and photo sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The spirit of these women is just unbelievable," Nye said. "Mama Quon, (for 
example), cooked all her life" at the Grand Star Restaurant on Sun Mun Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheung, who retired in the 1940s, flew with Amelia Earhart, Nye said, and was 
a member of the 99 Club when the famed pilot was president. 
</P>
<P>
 After seeing her larger-than-life portrait, 63-year-old librarian Ruby Ling 
Louie felt a sense of nostalgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Metro Plaza is on the site of the old China City, which is where my 
parents had their three shops," Louie said. "The tribute to the women is 
important because I think they symbolize my mother and my mother-in-law . . . 
who didn't (make) any mark except for their children."  
</P>
<P>
 But Chinatown activist Don Toy would like Nye to develop follow-up programs to 
explain the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people just drive by and see (the murals), they wouldn't know who the 
women are," Toy said. "There needs to be additional types of events to tie it 
in together. . . . People have to participate and have that emotional link."

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: CHINATOWN; RESIDENTS INSPECT RAIL WALKWAY PLANS

<P>
 After meeting with the community for five months, an architectural firm is 
close to completing designs for a walkway to the planned light-rail station on 
Alameda and College streets, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The community expressed the need (for) a landmark, a gateway" at the station, 
said Helena Lin Jubany, an architect and owner of Jubany-Mutlow Architecture.  
</P>
<P>
 The Downtown company was hired by the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 
March to conduct a $71,000 study on various methods of connecting the 28-foot 
elevated station to Chinatown. 
</P>
<P>
 That stop will be one of 14 the Pasadena Blue Line will make when it opens 
sometime after 1998, MTA officials said. The $841-million project, which 
received only $123 million in construction funds this fiscal year, covers a 
13.6-mile stretch that will also serve Pasadena, South Pasadena, Highland Park 
and Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no funding has been secured for a pedestrian connection to the 
Chinatown station, MTA officials and Chinatown community activists hope 
detailed plans for a walkway will make it easier to solicit financial support 
from the state or federal government or private developers. 
</P>
<P>
 The connection could also boost the appeal of a historic community that over 
the years has lost clientele to the San Gabriel Valley, residents and business 
leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This alone is not going to revitalize Chinatown, but I think it's going to be 
pointed in the right direction," said David Wayne Louie, vice president of the 
Chinatown Economic Development Council, who was among more than 100 people who 
attended an Aug. 4 community meeting with the architect. "It's going to embrace 
and not inhibit the community." 
</P>
<P>
 During the meeting at Chinatown's Cathay Manor, representatives from 
Jubany-Mutlow presented 10 concept drawings and focused on an elaborate walkway 
that would include a lower- and upper-level plaza design. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience of mainly senior citizens evaluated a model of the 375-foot ramp 
that would stretch from the station to North Broadway. From the station, Blue 
Line passengers would be able to take an elevator to the lower plaza or remain 
on the upper plaza, where they can walk to a small park or shop at the stores 
along the ramp. 
</P>
<P>
 Next to the walkway would be a three-story, 300-space parking structure. And a 
second pedestrian connection could be built diagonally from the upper plaza to 
a building on North Broadway, which could be developed as a senior citizens 
housing complex, Jubany-Mutlow officials said.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents also addressed the need for a public information booth manned by a 
bilingual speaker, restrooms and security patrols. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA officials want to hold another community meeting later this month or early 
next to discuss all the suggestions since March and present more detailed 
drawings of the upper and lower plazas. TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: CENTRAL: DOWNTOWN; APARTMENT OWNER TO FACE SLUM CHARGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 38-year-old Encino man is scheduled to be arraigned Thursday in Los Angeles 
Municipal Court on 22 counts of slum violations at his South Hope Street 
apartment building, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Youdai and his company, Advance Project Management Inc., were named on 
the misdemeanor complaint filed by the city attorney's office last month, said 
Deputy City Atty. Lawrence P.V. Punter. The charges were filed after the city's 
housing task force inspected the building at 1355 S. Hope St. between May 2 and 
June 16. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the four-story, 56-room brick apartment complex, inspectors discovered 
rodent and cockroach infestations, defective plumbing, missing and defective 
smoke detectors and damaged walls, the deputy city attorney said. Youdai could 
not be reached for comment.

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: MID-CITY; REWARD OFFERED IN SLAYING OF MINISTER

<P>
 A reward of $50,000 is being offered for information leading to the arrest of 
the killer of an 81-year-old minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Blanche Thomas, former pastor of Mt. Zion Churches United in Watts and a 
minister at the Holy Light Baptist Church at 96th Street and Normandie Avenue, 
was bound, gagged and sexually assaulted in her Mid-City apartment. The cause 
of death was under investigation last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas' grandson, Daniel Better, found the body when he checked in on her July 
25 after she did not respond to phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said her killer entered the apartment in the 1700 block of South La 
Brea Avenue between midnight and dawn the day she was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Although a few things were stolen, investigators doubt that robbery was the 
motive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just overwhelming to know she died like that," said Thomas' daughter, 
Dr. Shirley Jean Better, a professor of social work at Cal State Los Angeles. 
"You don't want your mother to die like that. You want her to die peacefully, 
in her sleep." 
</P>
<P>
 Better said that her mother, a former country schoolteacher in her native 
Arkansas, was a strong advocate of expanding women's roles in religion. 
</P>
<P>
 She also worked to inspire African American and Latino youths in her parish to 
pursue education as an alternative to the violence on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Several parishioners and members of the community have established a fund in 
Thomas' name to provide food and clothing for the homeless, who had become one 
of her most recent causes, Better said. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday, the City Council approved the posting of a $25,000 reward in 
order to encourage anyone with information to come forward. 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, televangelist Rev. Gene Scott donated a check matching that 
amount to the reward pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Galloway, press deputy for Councilman Nate Holden, who represents the 
Mid-City area, said a posthumous resolution acknowledging Thomas' 
accomplishments will be presented to her family Thursday by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone with information about Thomas' slaying can contact the Police 
Department's Wilshire Division at (213) 847-3990 or at (213) 485-4022 after 4

COMMUNITY NEWS: MID-CITY: KOREATOWN; HE HOPES MERCHANTS WILL SIGN UP FOR IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Television images of Koreatown businesses being burned and looted during the 
1992 riots struck a deep chord within Hyung Suk Kim as he watched from the 
safety of his La Habra home. 
</P>
<P>
 A Korean national, Kim had moved to the Los Angeles area only three years 
earlier to study graphic design at the Art Center College of Design in 
Pasadena. He was about to graduate and planned to pursue a master's degree that 
fall when the riots struck.  
</P>
<P>
 "I got a bad impression during the riots because the Korean community was 
targeted," said Kim, 36. "I wanted to help my people in the Koreatown 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Haunted by images of some of his countrymen losing their American dreams, Kim 
dedicated his graduate study to determining what had caused Koreatown to become 
a target of racially motivated violence, and what could be done to prevent 
another occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 In his research, Kim found that Latinos and African Americans make up most of 
Koreatown's population and that this non-Korean base felt alienated from Korean 
business owners for several reasons: their own poor economic conditions, envy 
of successful immigrants and the language barrier, especially in the form of 
signs.  
</P>
<P>
 "African Americans and Latinos don't understand this signage," he said. "These 
signs appear foreign to them so they feel uncomfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim concluded that changing the signage in Koreatown to include English could 
be an effective means of letting non-Koreans feel more welcome. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to make Koreatown's signage more culturally egalitarian, Kim's 
graduate thesis proposes bilingual English-Korean signs, with the English 
message slightly larger than and above the Korean message. 
</P>
<P>
 "Korean people here are well-educated," he said. "They understand at least 
some English, and are familiar with English signs. This would let people know 
that Koreatown does not belong to Korea, it is part of American society."

<P>
 Ramon Munoz, Kim's graduate adviser, supports the idea of bilingual signage. 
"To some extent, when you'd go down the street, you'd almost feel as though you 
understood Korean, seeing all the translations," he said. "That would make a 
lot of people who don't speak Korean feel more at ease." 
</P>
<P>
 Kim has also designed a master's project consisting of a series of posters 
calling for harmony in the community, displaying inspirational photographic 
images juxtaposed against equally balanced English and Korean-language 
messages.  
</P>
<P>
 A sample message reads: "Los Angeles is a unique historical circumstance. We 
are a diverse city with people from over 100 nations. If we learn to respect 
other cultures, we can grow as one community. It is like a tree with red, 
yellow and green leaves. It's more colorful to live in harmony."  
</P>
<P>
 Although his project does not include Spanish, Kim said the posters and signs 
could easily be adapted to include a third language. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim, who graduates next week, will display his posters, as well as models of 
some bilingual signs, from 6 to 8 p.m. Monday at Hollytron Electronics, 4641 W. 
Santa Monica Blvd. The exhibit will run through Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Kim said he hopes to generate interest in his signs and posters from city and 
community leaders, many of whom he has invited to the opening. However, he 
acknowledges that many merchants may be reluctant to change their all-Korean 
signs.  
</P>
<P>
 "He found that there were some Korean store owners who were very apathetic to 
what he was doing," Munoz said. "It's not all open arms." 
</P>
<P>
 Although merchants may be unwilling to adopt Kim's bilingual signs, five local 
businesses and organizations in addition to Hollytron will be showcasing his 
posters in their storefronts for the next few weeks. Kim hopes the city will 
take an interest in sponsoring the posters as billboards. 
</P>
<P>
 If either of his projects catch on, he said he will stay in the United States 
long enough to follow it through before returning to Korea to set up his own 
graphics firm. LESLIE BERESTEIN

 A peaceful solution to the nuclear arms tensions between the United States and 
North Korea was the primary focus of a recent education forum at the Korean 
Youth and Student Union.  
</P>
<P>
 About 40 students, peace activists and other concerned Korean Americans 
gathered to discuss the situation, questioning the veracity of recent reports 
that point to the existence of nuclear weapons in North Korea and trying to 
determine whether there is a threat of war. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants in the July 28 forum also discussed the need felt by many Korean 
Americans to replace the Korean War Armistice -- approved as a cease-fire 
treaty on July 27, 1953 -- with a binding peace treaty among the United States, 
North Korea and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been almost half a century since the Korean peninsula was divided," said 
Yong Un Yuk, of the Korean Youth and Student Union. "Now even in the Middle 
East, there is talk of peace." 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the current weapons scare, Yuk said, a Korean peace treaty is 
especially necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to the U.S., the war can resume at any moment," he said, adding 
that Korean Americans all over the country have begun to fear the worst. 
</P>
<P>
 Following presentations by a number of speakers, organizers introduced a 
petition they plan to circulate calling for support of negotiation efforts to 
lessen tensions between the United States and North Korea, as well as for 
normalization of relations and reunification of the Korean peninsula. Addressed 
to the U.S., North Korean and South Korean governments, the petitions will be 
circulated by Korean peace activists nationwide, forum leaders said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minsu Lee, a Korean immigrant, said reunification would spur a morale boost in 
Korean communities nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "If any of my children ask me, 'Where are you from, Papa,' I have to point to 
the south," he said. "I want to be able to show them the whole country." LESLIE

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: EAST LOS ANGELES; GOLDEN GATE THEATER IS SAFE -- FOR NOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY ANNE PEREZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For now, the Golden Gate Theater at Whittier and Atlantic boulevards is safe 
from the wrecking ball, but East Los Angeles activists can only wonder for how 
long. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners have mounted an effort to get the theater, which was built in 1927, 
off the National Register of Historic Places to clear the way for demolition. 
They believe, according to a report filed by the Los Angeles Conservancy, that 
the property would be easier to sell without the 11,000-square-foot movie 
theater. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-member State Historical Resources Commission voted Aug. 5 to defer a 
decision on the owner's request until its Nov. 4 meeting. The commission wants 
to gather more information about the theater's interior. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that we won the battle but the war still goes on," said Aurora 
Castillo, the president of Mothers of East Los Angeles who traveled to speak 
before the commission in Sacramento on behalf of her organization. "We feel 
that we should preserve our heritage," she said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo said she can remember as a teen-ager going to see first-run movies at 
the theater, one of fewer than two dozen buildings in Los Angeles in the 
Spanish Churrigueresque style, according to the conservancy. The entrance to 
the theater replicates the portal of the University of Salamanca in Spain.  
</P>
<P>
 The effort to preserve the theater has become all the more urgent because the 
Vega Building, another structure in the same architectural style on the site, 
was demolished in 1992 after officials determined that the 1987 Whittier 
Narrows earthquake had rendered it a hazard.  
</P>
<P>
 The Angelopoulos family, which has owned the property for 20 years, could not 
be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The family wants to pursue getting the theater off the national register so 
that it might be demolished in the future if other options have been exhausted, 
said their attorney, Jerold B. Neuman. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have looked for a project that could accommodate the theater and have 
proposed to preserve historic elements of the architecture," Neuman said. One 
proposal would have made the theater the headquarters for the El Gallo Giro 
restaurant chain. The company planned to build a restaurant where the Vega 
Building once stood and open the main part of the theater for community 
gatherings, he said, but those plans fell through. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from their effort to keep the historical designation intact, those 
interested in saving the Golden Gate Theater are looking to the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority, which decided last month to find funds to buy the 
site for a Metro Red Line station. The MTA's vote was unusual because, although 
the property had been targeted for the station, it lies in the second phase of 
the Eastside extension, which has not yet been funded. 
</P>
<P>
 Another ray of hope came at an Aug. 2 meeting of the County Board of 
Supervisors. The board voted 3-2 to approve Supervisor Gloria Molina's motion 
to designate the theater as a "historical resource." 
</P>
<P>
 Neuman said that the supervisors have made it nearly impossible to demolish 
the theater, as the owners would have to do a costly environmental-impact 
report as well as receive a demolition permit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a victory for the community," said Frank Villalobos, president 
of Barrio Planners Inc., an Eastside architectural firm. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: LINCOLN HEIGHTS; IT'S HIS BUSINESS TO HELP YOUTHS

<P>
 Four years after starting a program to help gang members get out of the city 
to cool off their rivalries, Edward Byrom, a Franciscan brother, plans to 
expand his efforts into a more business-oriented venture. 
</P>
<P>
 In a partnership with The East Los Angeles Community Union (TELACU), the 
Dismas Youth Program will now be known as the Dismas Development Corp. TELACU 
had first contracted with Dismas in September, 1993, to hire 21 gang members 
from around its City View Terrace townhome development for construction jobs.Of 
those, 16 have been hired by construction contractors, said TELACU spokeswoman 
J.C. Flores. 
</P>
<P>
 The new corporation, although still a nonprofit, will take on community 
development projects of its own. The goal is to become more self-sufficient and 
to provide long-term employment for its workers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is negotiating with the city of Los Angeles for contracts to rehabilitate 
condemned buildings. Other projects under way include a program to establish a 
union on the construction site of an apartment complex, and a contract to build 
single-family residences for an affordable-housing developer. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrom founded Dismas Youth Program in 1990 when he learned of a youth whose 
brother was shot to death right in front of him. Byrom arranged to have the 
young man removed from his neighborhood to give him a chance to cool off. He 
then founded Dismas, named after the repentant thief who was crucified with 
Jesus, to give gang members an opportunity to spend a few days at a Malibu 
retreat owned by the Catholic Church and have job training when they return. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that people can change and people do change; all they have to do is 
ask," said Byrom. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH LOS ANGELES; GROUP SEEKS TO SAVE DETERIORATING 
PARKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LAVIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Perched on a picnic bench beneath a shade tree, community activist Charles 
Rachal told a group of listeners about what his park used to be: a common 
ground for neighbors to gather in harmony. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be here at 9:30 in the morning to go to the pool," the former gang 
member said, pointing at a dried-out, grave-like pool at South Park. "It's a 
real frustrating situation . . . this park symbolized a safe ground." 
</P>
<P>
 Rachal's audience Aug. 5 was a group of park advocates brought together by 
People for Parks, a nonprofit outfit dedicated to revitalizing urban parks and 
recreation centers. The group, which included city officials and community 
activists, was taken on a tour of five city and county parks in South Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides giving participants a firsthand look at the deterioration of 
underfunded parks, the four-hour tour served as a prelude to a conference 
titled "Reinventing Urban Recreation," which took place the next day in West 
Hollywood.  
</P>
<P>
 "We want to develop partnerships with different agencies to increase the life 
chances of poor children," said tour organizer Jack Foley, a founder of People 
for Parks and a professor of recreation and leisure studies at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The common denominator at each park on the Aug. 5 tour was a lack of funds to 
provide services for children using the facilities, Foley said.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's clearly a problem of 'recreational apartheid,' " Foley said. "There's 
two separate and unequal public parks systems. One is in the affluent areas 
where they can afford to charge fees, and the other is in lower income areas."  
</P>
<P>
 During the group's visit to the Will Rogers Memorial Park swimming pool in 
Watts, Rachal reminisced about activities that were available for youths. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back when I was a kid, I went to the park every day. There were carnivals and 
festivals on holidays and the youth was involved with the parks," said Rachal, 
a member of South-Central Youth Community Services, a gang prevention group. 
"Now they're getting involved with gang activity instead." 
</P>
<P>
 Violence in the park came to the public's attention in June, when six 
lifeguards at the Will Rogers pool were attacked within three days. One 
lifeguard remains in a coma. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the attack was prompted in part by tensions that grew out of 
the county's decision in April to charge admission to the pool. Shortly after 
the violence, Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke stepped in and obtained 
private contributions to pay the fees at the pool. ENRIQUE LAVIN

 Get educated: Travel. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity to experience life outside of South Los Angeles was given last 
week to 40 lower-income area youngsters, who got a taste of life in Northern 
California for three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "California is large," said Darwin Laidley, 12, from a telephone at Monterey's 
Fisherman's Wharf. "I've never seen these beautiful things before. There's more 
trees out here." 
</P>
<P>
 The trip was sponsored by the Los Angeles Urban League through a donation from 
the private sector. The 9- to 12-year-olds left from the Urban League's 
headquarters in the Crenshaw District Tuesday morning, traveling up the coast 
with stops in Santa Barbara at Kids World and in Carmel for dinner. After two 
days of checking out the sites at Monterey Bay, including a visit to the city's 
aquarium, the travelers returned Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mack, president of the Los Angeles Urban League, said an important 
criteria in selecting the youngsters was that their parents couldn't afford a 
trip of this nature. "We also wanted to make sure and recognize that they were 
not youngsters in the streets making trouble," he said. "Travel and exposure of 
this type is only secondary to formal education." 
</P>
<P>
 The main source of funding for the tour was provided by Noel Irwin-Hentschel, 
chairwoman of AmericanTours International, through the Noel Foundation, which 
she created last year. The foundation is a seven-year commitment to foot the 
cost of taking 40 youths from South and East Los Angeles to destinations 
throughout the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked (Mack) what needed to be done in the community to help make a 
change," said Irwin-Hentschel. "He said, 'Children have nothing to look forward 
to.' So I asked if they've ever been outside of their area." 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin-Hentschel, who grew up in South-Central and has traveled extensively, 
said Monterey was this year's destination because of its historic significance 
as the state's first capital and because of the area's natural beauty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tremendous eye-opener for those youth, for them to see what there is 
in life," Mack said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's the first time that I'm away from home . . . and I'm not scared," said 
Roxana Luevano, a 10-year-old student at San Miguel Catholic School in Watts. 
"I learned that some people are nice." ENRIQUE LAVIN

<P>
 Faced with overcrowding at middle schools feeding into Jefferson and Fremont 
high schools, the Los Angeles Unified School District last week broke ground on 
the site for an elementary school at 56th Street near Slauson Avenue.  
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the school will begin in mid-October, with completion slated 
for July, 1996, district officials said. Funds for the $29-million school come 
from 1992 school construction bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, temporarily named Jefferson New Middle School No. 1, will help 
ease campus density at Adams and Carver middle schools in the Jefferson 
cluster, and Bethune and Edison middle schools in the Fremont cluster.  
</P>
<P>
 "The schools in that area have been capping out kids for a long time," said 
Joyce Payton, director of the district's office of school utilization. "Even 
though the schools are (year-round), they don't have enough space. " 
</P>
<P>
 Many youngsters who live in the area have been bused to other schools, usually 
in the Westside and the San Fernando Valley, to alleviate overcrowding, Payton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Bethune, the school district anticipates the student population to increase 
an additional 1,900 by the time the school is completed, said Lynn Roberts, the 
district's director of facility planning.  
</P>
<P>
 Jefferson New Middle School No. 1 will accommodate up to 2,900 seventh- 
through ninth-graders on a year-round schedule, Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14.8-acre school will feature a three-story classroom building and a 
separate five-classroom shops building. There will be 51 general classrooms, 
with space reserved to build up to eight additional classrooms if needed. 
</P>
<P>
 The facilities will include two computer laboratories, 10 science classrooms 
and two rooms each for art, business education, home economics, music, drama 
and speech, and communications. 
</P>
<P>
 "Rather than building a single-story design, we went with the multistory 
building to avoid the displacement of businesses and people in the community," 
Roberts said.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the school will have a gymnasium, a multipurpose room with a 
kitchen and outdoor lunch area, and subterranean parking for approximately 150 
vehicles. ENRIQUE LAVIN

<P>
 The owner of an apartment complex was ordered to pay $10,084 in fines and 
costs after he pleaded no contest July 21 to criminal slum charges in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold W. Dickens, a South-Central-based attorney, was sentenced by Judge 
Barry Taylor after entering pleas to 10 violations of fire, health, and 
building and safety codes at the two-story, 20-unit stucco complex he owns at 
1241-1245 Martin Luther King Jr. Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickens was placed on three years' probation and ordered to complete repairs 
by Sept. 13 or face the possibility of jail time, said Deputy City Atty. 
Lawrence P.V. Punter, who handled the case.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Dickens said he will work on the improvements with "limited funds," 
he contends that the apartments are in livable condition. "I don't believe my 
buildings are in slum-like conditions," Dickens said. "The word slum, to me, is 
very vague." 
</P>
<P>
 Punter said the case was based on code violations found at the complex during 
city Slum Housing Task Force inspections between Jan. 26 and April 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Those violations included over-fused electrical panels, inadequate electrical 
services, missing and defective smoke detectors, inadequate fire doors, lack of 
heat in some units, damaged walls, windows and floors, defective plumbing, 
cockroach and rodent infestations, and accumulations of trash and debris around 
the premises. ENRIQUE LAVIN

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: VERNON; TOXIC-WASTE FOES: VICTORY IN DEFEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SIMON ROMERO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the community group lost in a state appellate court last week, 
Mothers of East Los Angeles has succeeded in helping prevent a local company 
from transporting toxic waste in what has been called one of the state's most 
polluted cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The 2nd Appellate Court's decision Wednesday upheld a Superior Court ruling 
that the city was justified in granting a conditional-use permit in 1992 to JCI 
Environmental Services Inc., 4133 Bandini Blvd., to transport hazardous waste. 
</P>
<P>
 Mothers of East L.A. sued JCI and the city that year over the issuance of the 
permit after it was discovered that the company failed to properly store 
hazardous waste on its property and that other conditions were not being met. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, following pleas from Mothers of East L.A., the City Council revoked 
the company's permit after a monitoring system detected that a waste tank was 
leaking. 
</P>
<P>
 City inspectors also cited potential soil contamination and violation of 
frontage requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave JCI every opportunity to do the right thing and they failed to," said 
Roger Wilner, an attorney helping represent the city in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Aurora Castillo of the nonprofit Mothers of East L.A.: "We still claim 
this as a victory, since their permit was removed,"  
</P>
<P>
 JCI representatives were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 With a fleet of about 25 tank trucks, service trucks and other company 
vehicles, JCI transported hazardous waste for companies in Los Angeles and 
several Southeast cities. By definition, hazardous waste can explode, ignite, 
corrode metal and poison or damage organisms. 
</P>
<P>
 JCI handled wastes mainly in liquid form, contained in steel drums, said Andy 
Yamamoto, an attorney representing the Mothers of East L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, this will teach JCI to clean up its act," said Yamamoto. "JCI has 
been a repeat offender when it comes to environmental regulations in the state 
of California." 
</P>
<P>
 According to documents submitted in the case:  
</P>
<P>
 * In 1992, the California Regional Water Quality Control Board fined JCI -- 
then J.C. Inc. Liquid Waste Disposal -- $32,000 for soil contamination and 
potential threats to ground water at a former South El Monte hazardous-waste 
facility it operated before it opened its Vernon facility. 
</P>
<P>
 * In 1984, the company was charged with two criminal violations involving one 
of its vacuum trailers that was left abandoned on a Vernon city street. An 
investigation revealed that the trailer, which contained paint stripper, had 
sat unattended on a public street for eight days. 
</P>

 * In 1982, a company trailer carrying 11,380 pounds of coal tar slurry 
reportedly spilled 84 pounds of the sludge onto Azusa Avenue in South El Monte.

 According to Carlos Porras, Southern California director of the Venice-based 
Citizens for a Better Environment, Vernon has been documented as the dirtiest 
ZIP code in the state. The city is home to steel and chemical manufacturers and 
distributors and the West Coast's largest lead battery recycler. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by the California Public Interest Research Group revealed 
that the city annually emits, processes or stores 27 million pounds of toxics 
-- more than three times as much as the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 With 150 residents, Vernon has the smallest residential population of any 
incorporated city in the state. Its daytime population swells to about 50,000.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; T. J. MAXX STORE GIVES PLAZA A BOOST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 T. J. Maxx, the national discount retail chain, has begun construction at the 
Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza, and plaza officials are hoping the store will be 
a major boost for a mall marred for years by empty shops. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect it to be a big draw," plaza manager Joe Rouzan said of the 
30,000-square-foot store, scheduled to open in November. "They're (T. J. Maxx) 
moving real fast. Just over the past weekend, the construction workers made a 
lot of progress." 
</P>
<P>
 Nine storefronts on the plaza's upper level -- cleared for a theater complex 
that will be constructed outside the mall -- will be utilized for the 
department store. 
</P>
<P>
 The addition of T. J. Maxx and two women's clothing stores scheduled to open 
within the next two months -- Trapp's and Forever 21 -- will increase tenant 
occupancy from 70% to 85%, Rouzan said. The average for malls in Southern 
California is 85% to 90%. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a T. J. Maxx is open in Culver City, a few miles west of the Baldwin 
Hills mall, spokeswoman Jane Joyce said company officials decided that the 
Crenshaw Plaza area fit the store's demographic profile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at a variety of things -- household income, population density, 
number of families," she said. "Some people pointed out that we do have a store 
not very far away from the plaza. But we tend to cluster stores in areas that 
like our merchandise." 
</P>
<P>
 T. J. Maxx operates 44 stores in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall has been struggling for four years to attract major retailers. The 
plaza, the first shopping center on the West Coast when it opened in the 1940s, 
is anchored by Robinsons-May, the Broadway and Sears. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the center was enclosed and refurbished, opening as the Baldwin Hills 
Crenshaw Plaza in 1988, it has struggled with low occupancy rates, the 
recession and other problems.  
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, Robinsons-May shut down for six 
months, hurting nearby stores that depended on its customers for business. Two 
stores, McLendon's Hats and Buster Brown shoes, closed during that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, controversy erupted after city officials accused developer 
Alexander Haagen of trying to cut the city out of the mall's future profits. 
</P>
<P>
 After the city threatened to sue, Haagen reinstated the city's stake in the 
mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, the eight-day Metropolitan Transportation Authority mechanics 
struck a blow to the mall; many customers and employees take the bus to get 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Rouzan said, the new T. J. Maxx shows the mall is on the rebound. 
</P>
<P>
 And there are other signs as well: The Disney Store, which opened last year, 
has consistently reported the highest video sales of all Disney stores in the 
Southern California region, he noted, and Wilson's House of Suede and Leather 
has out-grossed its sister stores for the past three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson manager Felicia Fredieu, whose store is on the upper level, opposite 
the T. J. Maxx site, said she is looking forward to the increased foot traffic 
it is expected to bring. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really good news," she said. "The more stores in the mall, the better."

CITY TIMES COVER STORY; LOFTY DREAMS; THE DOWNTOWN ARTS SCENE, ONCE CONSIDERED 
DEAD, IS TRYING TO REVIVE ITS VISION OF BECOMING THE 'SOHO OF THE WEST.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE SEO

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During the late 1970s and early '80s, hundreds of artists and gallery owners 
searching for spacious lofts and cheap warehouse space moved Downtown to be 
part of an emerging art scene envisioned as a new "SoHo of the West." 
</P>
<P>
 But by the mid '80s, the galleries clustered just west of the Los Angeles 
River began to languish and artists began abandoning their industrial work 
spaces to be closer to their wealthy patrons in Santa Monica and other Westside 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The Downtown art scene had grown passe. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, after years of relative obscurity, a group of artists is fighting 
back. Convinced that Downtown has the potential to become Los Angeles' 
undisputed art center, they have begun an aggressive campaign to draw attention 
to the strengths of their beleaguered community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been declared as dead, but we're not dead," said Barbara Mendes, a 
painter and advocate for the Downtown arts revival. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're seen as a pitiful hellhole, but we know that we're really a groovy 
neighborhood. We want people to see that." 
</P>
<P>
 Although optimism is strong, the future of Downtown's art district remains 
dubious. Despite the vibrancy of the area's unique art colonies and loft 
buildings, the streets in east Downtown rarely bustle with pedestrians. 
Galleries and other small businesses are struggling to stay afloat, and art 
connoisseurs from other areas rarely patronize local galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 "In order to make a living here running a gallery, you need money behind you, 
you need to have a vision of the future and you need to know a lot of rich 
people," said Marc Kreisel, an artist and owner of Al's Bar on Hewitt Street. 
"People are creatures of convenience. If they live on the Westside, and can go 
to a gallery on the Westside, they'll do it. They won't come Downtown." 
</P>
<P>
 However, members of the Downtown Arts Development Assn., or DADA, are 
convinced that their struggling arts community can realize its second heyday -- 
with a little help. 
</P>
<P>
 In December, the 300-member group sponsored its first "Downtown Lives" art 
show, which involved 400 artists and attracted 4,000 people to its opening 
reception. The organization expects an even bigger turnout at this year's 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 In conjunction with the nonprofit L.A. Artcore Center gallery, the association 
also plans to sponsor a studio bus tour next year to introduce the public to 
Downtown artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "When people come down here, they love it," Mendes said. "That's why we're 
doing all this. We want the public to come here and enjoy themselves and buy 
our art." 
</P>
<P>
 While sipping an espresso at the Troy Cafe, playwright and Downtown arts 
activist Joel Bloom talked of his plan to open a small magazine and sundries 
shop on Traction Avenue. "There's a spark here -- hopefully we can light it," 
he said. "We're just going to have to think about how we can make this area 
more attractive and amicable." 
</P>
<P>
 Bloom, who used to live near Hancock Park, moved Downtown because he said 
there's no other place in Los Angeles with as much energy or sense of 
community. "I get a feeling here I haven't gotten anywhere else," he said. "It 
may look desolate, but it's not. There's no place I'd rather be." 
</P>
<P>
 Touting the virtues of Downtown is one thing, but creating an enduring arts 
scene appears to be a much more elusive goal. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, there is little more to catch the eye in Downtown's industrial 
corridor than rows of lifeless warehouses, freight trucks and the homeless 
hoping for a handout. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the streets are sprinkled with a few hip restaurants and night spots, 
such as Traction Cafe, Troy Cafe and 410 Boyd Street, old-time hangouts such as 
Gorky's Cafe and the Atomic Cafe are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Peterson, a painter and loft building owner, was among the first wave of 
artists to move into the area in 1976. While lofts now lease for $800 to $1,300 
a month, Peterson paid $75 a month for his first 2,500-square-foot studio in 
Little Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 By the early 1980s, hundreds of other artists had moved into Downtown 
warehouses that had been refurbished into apartments. Art dealers also took 
advantage of the area's relatively low rents and large spaces and began opening 
galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 It was common for artists to flock to two or three gallery openings every 
weekend. When Gorky's opened in 1981, it quickly became a place where artists 
met to discuss philosophy and their works over bottomless cups of coffee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just like New York's SoHo around that time, except there were less 
people," said Kreisel, who moved Downtown in 1971 and opened Al's Bar eight 
years later. "There were a conglomerate of galleries, but they're all gone now. 
They just couldn't make a living. I think Cirrus Gallery is the only one left." 
</P>
<P>
 Jean Milant, director of Cirrus Gallery on Alameda Street, said most galleries 
were doomed after rents rose, the recession hit and Santa Monica became the 
new, fashionable place for artists and art dealers. Milant said the only reason 
his gallery endured is because he was able to build a national clientele 
through contacts and years of successful shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's possible for galleries to open Downtown, but there's not a lot 
of financial incentive right now," he said. "It's difficult to run a gallery 
anywhere in Los Angeles because this town just doesn't support the arts." 
</P>
<P>
 The 1992 riots also devastated the area by making tourists even more leery 
about coming Downtown. This summer, Los Angeles Contemporary Exhibitions, or 
LACE, abandoned its Downtown warehouse space on Industrial Street for a leased 
gallery in Hollywood. Some in the arts community say LACE's departure marked 
the end of the Downtown arts era. 
</P>
<P>
 Matt Easton, executive assistant at the nonprofit gallery, said LACE decided 
to sell its Downtown site because its audience dwindled and it was struggling 
to pay its mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We wanted to cut costs, but we also wanted to be closer to people," he said. 
"We now see between 150 to 180 people at our gallery every weekend. At our old 
site, we didn't see that many people in a month. The riots marked a turning 
point. We lost 30% of our audience after that." 
</P>
<P>
 But amid the gallery departures and the talk of gloom and doom, there are 
signs that the Downtown arts scene may be rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
 After abandoning its Downtown location for Universal City in February, the 
Museum of Neon Art recently announced plans to open a second, larger gallery at 
a new site on Olympic Boulevard near Grand Avenue. Having received a $415,000 
Community Redevelopment Agency grant, the museum expects to open early next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think Downtown is a unique place because it's where a lot of cultures 
meet," said Mary Carter, director of the museum. "It may take some time and 
distance from the riots before people want to come Downtown again, but we were 
always interested in coming back Downtown because we feel it's the place to 
be." 
</P>
<P>
 Also, an Asian American arts complex will open in 1996 at the old Union Church 
of Los Angeles on San Pedro Street, said Erich Nakano, project manager of the 
Little Tokyo Service Center. The $4.9-million complex, equipped with a gallery 
and theater, will house L.A. Artcore, the East West Players and Visual 
Communications of Asian American Studies. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be the first Asian American multimedia complex in Los Angeles," 
Nakano said. "And it should help to revive the Little Tokyo community by 
increasing foot traffic in the area, especially at night. The businesses in the 
area should see a positive economic spinoff from that." 
</P>
<P>
 Plans to build a subway station at 3rd Street and Santa Fe Avenue could 
further revitalize the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "The subway will definitely bring in more pedestrians, and pedestrians will 
want street lighting and trees," said Drew Lesso, president of the Los Angeles 
River Art and Business Assn. "I think by the year 2000, the area will be 
completely different. There will be more businesses, more commerce and more 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Along with those new projects, efforts are under way to improve living 
conditions in the east Downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 The river art and business association, which was founded two years ago to 
improve city services, was instrumental in getting the city to install 29 
street lights in the area. Neighborhood Watch and graffiti-abatement programs 
have also been initiated. 
</P>
<P>
 Although crime does occur in the industrial corridor, many perceive the area 
to be far more dangerous than it really is, said Valerie Cardot, a senior lead 
officer in the Police Department's Central Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burglaries are common in that area, but in general, there's very little 
crime," she said. "There's more nuisance incidents than anything. People will 
call to say they're tired of the graffiti, transients or trash. But the violent 
crime rate is very low." 
</P>
<P>
 Life in the loft district is also more communal than outsiders might think, 
artists say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came from the East Village in New York, and moved here because I needed to 
have huge ceilings and space," said photo-realist painter Marc Greenblum, who 
lives at Factory Place. "I also like being surrounded by other artists. It's 
definitely the right place to be." 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent Friday evening, Graydon Dyck sat in his Factory Place loft amid 
piles of his work. Although a painter by trade, Dyck now creates automobile 
sculptures using everything from broken bottles and oatmeal boxes to scraps of 
fabric. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find a lot of the stuff from the railroad tracks," he said. "This area is a 
gold mine for my work." 
</P>
<P>
 And like most other artists, Dyck came Downtown for the space and to be part 
of Los Angeles' only artistic loft community. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also love this part of the city," he said. "I think it's very energetic and 
the people here are wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Downtown area, there are 1,200 to 1,500 lofts, according to a 1993 
survey by the Downtown art association. Peterson estimates that about 20 
galleries are in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a lot of ways, there's a lot more happening now than in its heyday," 
Peterson said. "We just need more amenities, like restaurants, bars and basic 
services. When that happens, I think more people will move down here and the 
area will thrive."

3 SITES CHOSEN FOR ANTI-GRAFFITI PROJECT; TAGGING: UNDER THE $500,000 PILOT 
PLAN, MARKINGS WILL BE REMOVED WITHIN 24 HOURS OF BEING REPORTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pico-Union, Westlake and Temple-Beaudry have been chosen as trial zones for an 
experimental six-month "zero-tolerance" anti-graffiti program recently approved 
by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in October, graffiti in these communities, as well as in parts of 
the San Fernando Valley, will be removed within 24 hours of the time it is 
reported.Until now, city graffiti abatement crews have worked within a 72-hour 
turnaround time. 
</P>
<P>
 The $500,000 project falls under the auspices of Operation Clean Sweep, a 
Department of Public Works program. Program director Delphia Jones said the 
pilot project will help the city determine whether quick removal helps deter 
tagging. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the program, she said, the city will use state-of-the-art paint 
mixing units for the first time to restore surfaces to their original quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar to the computer-matching systems found in paint stores, the hand-held 
units -- now being used in San Jose and San Francisco -- will analyze paint to 
come up with the perfect color match on the spot to eliminate the mismatched 
blotches that mar painted-over walls. 
</P>
<P>
 "People deserve a community that looks the way it did before (graffiti)," said 
Jones, adding that blotches often end up encouraging more graffiti. "If you 
paint out an area, it's a little square canvas that they can come back and 
paint graffiti on. Sometimes, they paint right over our paint-outs." 
</P>
<P>
 The city will accept bids for graffiti-removal contractors for the 
zero-tolerance zones, Jones said. Three crews will be hired, she said: one for 
the "high-frequency" inner-city, one for the "medium-frequency" Northridge and 
Reseda zones and another for the "low-frequency" Mission Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the city will continue hiring community-based groups to paint out 
graffiti in various areas, Jones said, these groups will not participate in the 
experimental program because the city needs to determine actual costs.

SOAP MAKER TO APPEAL FOR PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOMMY LI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A public hearing will be held Tuesday on a cleaning-solvent factory owner's 
appeal to turn a vacant, 1.75-acre parcel into a 25-space parking lot for 
employees, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Rosenbaum, president of Mission Kleensweep Products Inc., wants the 
five-member Board of Zoning Appeals to overturn a city zoning administrator's 
denial of a conditional use permit for the property. 
</P>
<P>
 The permit would allow Rosenbaum to build the parking lot at 2428 Birkdale 
St., next to Mission Kleensweep. The land is zoned for single-family homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum has said a parking lot would benefit the neighborhood because it 
will reduce the number of vehicles left on streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But a group of Elysian Valley residents oppose the plan, concerned that it is 
a sign the company plans to expand. 
</P>
<P>
 A parking lot packed with vehicles would also create additional space on 
public streets for large trucks to rest, said Virginia Adams, co-president of 
the Elysian Valley Property Owners, Renters & Businessmen's Assn. The trucks 
deliver cargo for Mission Kleensweep, which manufactures detergents, hand soaps 
and cleaners for commercial use. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenbaum denied that the trucks would flood the streets throughout the day, 
adding that deliveries are usually made at the company's own yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would they do that? (Trucks) just want to make a delivery and get out," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing will be at 9:45 a.m. in City Hall, Room 561 A. TOMMY LI

MANUAL LABOR; AS A COACH AND A COUNSELOR, ANDREA ANTHONY WILL HELP GIVE HER 
PLAYERS A GAME PLAN ON AND OFF THE BASKETBALL COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIRBY LEE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the eyes of Andrea Anthony, there's little difference between coaching and 
counseling. Anthony will offer a little of both in her job as the new girls' 
basketball coach at Manual Arts High. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a counselor, you're kind of coaching people to deal with their lives and 
give them a game plan," Anthony said. "Basketball gives an opportunity to 
different people with different personalities to work together." 
</P>
<P>
 Counseling and basketball are subjects, Anthony, an All-City forward at Locke 
High in 1980 and '81, knows well. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony, 32, is working for a master's degree in counseling with an emphasis 
on marriage, family and child counseling at Cal State Los Angeles and is 
completing her field work as a counseling assistant at Manual Arts. 
</P>
<P>
 Playing alongside two-time Olympian Cynthia Cooper, the 5-foot-8 Anthony 
helped the Saints to the City Section and State titles as a senior in 1981. 
Anthony scored 15 points in a 73-61 victory over San Jose's Lynbrook High in 
the State championship game, capping a 19-2 season for Locke, which won its 
last 18 games after a 1-2 start. 
</P>
<P>
 No City girls team has won a State championship since. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ability in City basketball is still there, but I think the dedication and 
the hunger for the game is lacking," Anthony said. "If you don't have that, 
it's very hard to be competitive. We had fun when we played, but the intensity 
was unbelievable. If we were told to run in practice, we asked 'Where?' You 
tell players that today and they'll ask 'How long?' and complain and whine." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a problem Anthony's predecessor, Jack Mitchell, who stepped down to 
become a crisis counselor at the school, has seen as well. He notes other 
factors in the decline of City girls' basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 "Talent-wise, City teams are comparable in skill and depth with Southern 
Section schools," Mitchell said. "But you go to a summer league game at 
Peninsula (High in Rolling Hills Estates) and there are 40 parents. When we 
were playing for the conference title, we had three parents show up. It makes 
it an uphill battle when you don't have that kind of support from the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Mitchell, who had a 38-28 record in four seasons and will continue to 
assist with the girls' basketball program, helped the Toilers rebound from a 
2-12 season to finish 15-3 in 1992 and win their first conference title in more 
than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we've gained the respect of coaches and changed the reputation," 
Mitchell said. "I just wanted the team to have a good coach, especially a 
female athlete as a role model to help them not just with basketball, but with 
academic advisement and relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony also plans to draw on the expertise of one of her role models, Lucious 
Franklin, an assistant under Art Webb during Anthony's days at Locke. Anthony 
faced her former coach in her first game as coach in the Crenshaw summer league 
against Locke, but suffered a defeat.  
</P>
<P>
 "Lucious played a big part in my development and I want to utilize the talent 
of the people who shaped me as a player and a person," Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony played two seasons at Oxnard Community College, where she was the 
Western State Conference most valuable player and inducted into the Ventura 
County Hall of Fame as a sophomore in 1983. As an elementary education major, 
she played a season at UC Irvine before transferring to Northern Montana and 
earning All-Frontier Conference honors as a senior in 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony returned to Los Angeles and worked as a counselor at Hollygrove 
Children's home, a treatment facility for emotionally disturbed children, for 
the next three years. She worked with special education students at Hillside 
Elementary School until 1991 when she started her graduate work at Cal State 
L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to talk to her," said Manual Arts senior guard Martha Angol. "You 
can talk to her about stuff other than basketball." 
</P>
<P>
 Basketball, however, has still remained a big part of Anthony's life over the 
years. She still plays in weekly pickup games at Rancho Cienega Park. Anthony 
offers her services at basketball camps in Montana in the summers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Montana was definitely a learning experience, but I wanted to come back to 
L.A. and a community where my talents can be used," Anthony said. "I feel I can 
be a valuable asset to a girls' basketball team. It's important to expose them 
to women my age to see you can play ball and be a lady with a career."

TRAILBLAZER PAUL GONZALES FINISHES A GOLDEN CAREER; BOXING: EAST L.A. HERO 
BECAME THE FIRST LATINO TO WIN AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL. BUT LIFE AS A 
PROFESSIONAL FIGHTER BROUGHT MIXED RESULTS.

 On Aug. 11, 1984, Paul Gonzales started a gold rush at the Los Angeles 
Olympics, becoming the first of nine American boxers to win a gold medal. The 
victory also was significant because Gonzales became the first Latino to win an 
Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 On the 10th anniversary of his achievement, Gonzales announced his retirement 
from boxing at the Amateur Athletic Foundation in the Adams District. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boxing has been a very important and exciting period of my life," Gonzales 
said during Thursday's press conference. "But it's time to close that chapter 
of my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Al Stanke, the Los Angeles Police Department officer who transformed Gonzales 
from a barrio street punk to a Olympic champion, spoke first about his protege. 
</P>
<P>
 "I met Paul when he was 9 years old," Stanke said. "He was a mischievous kid. 
A cute kid. . . . He was scrappy, and good and tough. And he had attitude." 
</P>
<P>
 Stanke brought Gonzales to the Hollenbeck Division, where the building's 
basement had been converted to a boxing gym. "(Paul) threw punches even when he 
was on the ground. I knew he had all the D's: dedication, desire and 
determination." 
</P>
<P>
 Coached by Stanke, Gonzales won 18 national Amateur Athletic Union titles. As 
a pro, Gonzales had an 18-4 record as a flyweight and a bantamweight. His 
success was limited by injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he announced his retirement, Gonzales asked Danny Valdivia, who was 
ring announcer of that fight, to re-enact his gold medal victory announcement 
from the 1984 Games. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gold medal winner of the 106-pound division, from East L.A., Paul 
Gonzales!" Valdivia said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his farewell speech, Gonzales said that he wants to end his much-publicized 
feud with Oscar De La Hoya, the 1992 Olympic champion and fellow East L.A. 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oscar and I, as Olympians, need to work together and need to show kids a 
brighter future," Gonzales said. 
</P>

 The Great Western Forum reshuffled its boxing card for Monday night when Mark 
Johnson of Washington failed to recover from a shoulder injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, ranked No. 2 by the International Boxing Federation, dislocated his 
right shoulder during workouts for his scheduled 12-round bout against Narcisco 
Rodriguez of the Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one feels worse about this than me," said Johnson, who is 20-1 with 13 
knockouts. Rodriguez, who was making his U.S. debut, is 13-0 with seven 
knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
 The main event will match Marco Antonio Barrera (31-1, 21 knockouts) against 
Vinicio (Junior) Rodriguez (14-3-1, 11 knockouts) in a super bantamweight bout. 
Preliminary bouts begin at 7:15 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Of local interest, Julio Cesar Borboa of East Los Angeles will make his sixth 
IBF junior bantamweight title defense against Harold Grey of Colombia on Aug. 
29 at the Forum. Borboa, originally of Sonora, Mexico, is 23-4 with 21 
knockouts. Grey is 15-0 with 14 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Frankie Avelar of San Diego will challenge undefeated Roberto Garcia of Oxnard 
in a 10-round featherweight bout as one of two main events Aug. 27 at the 
Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Avelar is 16-4 with eight knockouts, and Garcia is 14-0 with 11 knockouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepe Reilly of Glendale (7-1, 6 KOs) will be the other headliner, against an 
opponent to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In amateur boxing, Carlos Navarro returned to Los Angeles after an impressive 
showing at the Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg, Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro, the U.S. National flyweight champion from South Central, took the 
silver medal in the 112-pound division.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Amateur bouts will be held today at the Toberman Settlement House, 131 N. 
Grand Ave., San Pedro. Weigh-ins begin at 9 a.m. The Bassett Boxing Club 
canceled its amateur bouts last week because of lack of interest.

 A July 31 Film Clip about Dark Horse comics incorrectly referred to RoboCop as 
a character created by the comic-book company. The original "RoboCop" 
screenplay was created by Ed Neumeier and Michael Miner; Dark Horse comics 
subsequently picked up the character and based a comic on it.

SCILLY SEASON; NOTHING MUCH HAPPENS ON THE ISLES OF SCILLY. BUT THAT'S EXACTLY 
THE POINT OF VISITING A SPOT REMINISCENT OF RURAL ENGLAND GENERATIONS AGO. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD HOMAN, Homan is an assistant foreign editor at the Washington Post. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For a yuppie couple from Britain's Midlands, a high point of their week's stay 
on the Isles of Scilly, 30 miles off the southwest tip of England, was the 
whistling concert they heard one night from the parking lot below their hotel 
window when the Mermaid, the islands' most popular pub, closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really rather interesting," the woman related in the breakfast room 
the next morning. "It wasn't just little tunes they whistled, it was whole 
songs, all the way through. They started with "Rule Britannia" of course, and 
then somebody whistled something else. Then people would call for more and 
someone else would whistle something. I don't know how they have the muscles to 
whistle for so long, but it beats fighting -- and it sent me right off to 
sleep, I'll tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 For a boy on a rented bicycle, it was pumping his way to the top of the road 
to the 16th-Century Garrison overlooking Hugh Town on St. Mary's Island. "My 
whole family is down there, cheering me on," he volunteered proudly to a 
passerby, as he gulped for air. 
</P>
<P>
 For Petra, a dental nurse in her 20s, the Scillies provided a place to let the 
stress of a frantically paced London melt away. "In London, people measure time 
by the second," she said. "Here they hardly measure it at all. I'm sure the 
people who live here can see the tension in Londoners' eyes when they first 
arrive -- before they've realized they can relax." 
</P>
<P>
 The Scillies -- a compact cluster of dozens of islands, only five of them 
inhabited, and each of those small enough to be walked easily from one end to 
the other -- look like a chunk of rural England of a couple generations ago, 
maybe lifted from coastal Cornwall or Devon and flung out into the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 Burial artifacts give evidence of prehistoric settlement 1,000 or more years 
BC, and skimpily recorded history puts Christian monks on the Scillies in the 
5th or 6th Centuries AD, when, according to maps they left behind, the islands 
were a single land mass, not yet eroded by the ocean into their present 
fragments. Arthurian legend places the idyllic land of Lyonnesse on portions of 
a Greater Scilly now submerged beneath the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 What still remains above water (the highest point is just 160 feet above sea 
level and geologists give the islands only another 49,500 years before they 
vanish) constitutes, today, the Isles of Scilly, with patchwork fields covering 
the leeward sides and moors of tougher vegetation braving those exposed to the 
ocean winds. Between them are shoals, and waters shallow enough that at some 
seasons one can walk between the islands at low tide. Standing on a hill on one 
of the islands one afternoon, a Scillies resident looked at a neighboring 
island, across two miles of ocean whipped by a breeze into frothy whitecaps. "I 
walked over to that island once at low tide," he reminisced. "It was hardly 
more than thigh deep. But bear in mind, it was March then." 
</P>
<P>
 To understand the Scillies -- and to avoid disappointment if you're put 
together differently than the people who flock there yearly -- it's important 
to know what they are not. 
</P>
<P>
 They're not hot, although the people who live there think they are. "Yesterday 
was a scorcher," one told me by way of warning the August morning I arrived. It 
had gotten up to 69, she said with a grimace. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it's not hot, there's no ocean swimming or sunbathing to speak of. Most 
of the few people in the water on an August day are hardy children wading, or 
adults, with nets, shrimping. A woman who complained that she had fallen asleep 
on the beach and "got sunburned" acknowledged, under questioning, that what had 
gotten burned was her left ankle -- the only part of her otherwise fully 
dressed body left uncovered against the chill breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for a couple of pubs and some hotel bars, there's virtually no night 
life. One evening a community theater presented J.B. Priestley's "An Inspector 
Calls," and other nights there were slide lectures on local birds, flowers and 
shipwrecks. On a Sunday night, I walked the six-block length of the main street 
of Hugh Town, the Scillies' only commercial center, without seeing or hearing a 
moving vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's definitely not a jet-set destination. Access to the Scillies from 
London is by train or car to Penzance, the closest city on the English 
mainland, and then a 20-minute helicopter ride or three-hour ferry trip. The 
biggest of the islands' 10 hotels has only 40 rooms, and most are much smaller. 
When former Prime Minister Harold Wilson, who has a modest house on St. Mary's, 
and Prince Charles, who, with his family, stays on privately owned Tresco 
Island, come to the Scillies, it's to escape clamor, not to cause it. 
</P>
<P>
 What does a visitor do then on the Scillies? Well, the chief pastime, it 
seems, is simply moving about and coming to a stop when necessary, to rest, eat 
lunch or refuel at a pub and, later, to indulge in calorie-laden pastries with 
clotted cream at a tea garden. This moving about can be walking or biking the 
miles of paths -- up and down hills covered with gorse and heather, through 
fields of flowers, along rocky coasts and sandy beaches. Or it could be taking 
a 15-minute boat ride to one of the other islands and then walking or biking 
it, exploring its coves and fields and examining its ruins. And on Friday 
nights there's the big social event of the week: gathering on the quay or in 
boats to watch Scillies' boatmen race six-oared gigs, some of them more than a 
century old, between the islands. 
</P>
<P>
 This low-key formula packs them in on the Scillies, it turns out. Most of the 
hotels and guest houses are booked up well before summer (many people reserve 
for the following year at the same time they check out) and the islands, which 
have a resident population of only 2,000, are at their carefully controlled 
tourist capacity for much of the spring and summer. "What brings you all the 
way out here?" Tony, the headwaiter at Tregarthen's Hotel, asked me at 
breakfast my first morning. "You're an American, aren't you?" Unmasked at the 
start. So much for trying to blend in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do many Americans come here?" I asked. I hadn't seen any, nor, it turned out, 
did I in the remainder of my stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not many," he said, "but a few have recently. One of your big newspapers did 
an article on us and that might have started it." 
</P>
<P>
 Was it a good article? 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, mostly, there was nothing really wrong -- but they do have to be a bit 
artistic, don't they?" 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't artistic enough to come up with a good reason for being there, other 
than that I'd wanted someplace pleasant that I'd never visited, to relax for a 
few days and look at English birds. The Scillies are famed in British birding 
circles as a place to see rarities, but the time for seeing them is October and 
the rarities are usually North American birds that have been blown off course 
and wind up in the Scillies as their first landfall. In October, the placid 
pace of life in the Scillies is ruptured by the presence of 200 or more 
"twitchers," as the British call birders who maniacally chase rarities, darting 
from island to island. 
</P>
<P>
 When I wrote birding friends in England to ask recommendations for staying in 
the Scillies in August, I received anguished pleas that I change my plans. I'd 
see nothing then but English birds, they warned. There's nothing happening in 
the Scillies in August, it would be dead quiet, they implored. It sounded 
ideal. 
</P>
<P>
 Resigned to my going in the wrong season, the friends gave me some helpful 
advice: Allow time in my travel connections for possible delays due to fog or 
wind; stay at Tregarthen's Hotel (and make contact with Will Wagstaff, a 
top-notch birder and botanist who is field officer for the Isles of Scilly 
Environmental Trust, which administers the public lands of the islands and 
promotes conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 I treated myself to the overnight sleeper from London's Paddington Station to 
Penzance, although there also are several daytime trains that make the trip in 
about five hours. In Penzance, hungry from my trip, I spotted the Baker Boy's 
Oven Door and promptly was overwhelmed by my first brush with Cornish pastry. 
There, in two big show windows, were 52 (I counted them) different kinds of 
pastries, with such baffling names as "tiger baps," "granary bloomers," "white 
twinnies" and "long white unders." I grabbed a meat-stuffed "Cornish pasty" 
(pronounced PASS-tee), took a shuttle bus to the heliport a mile away and 
boarded the 32-passenger Sikorsky S61 helicopter that makes the quick flight to 
the Scillies several times a day, weather permitting, for a fare of $60. 
</P>
<P>
 From an altitude of 1,000 feet, I had stunning views of Cornwall's 
jigsaw-patterned fields, then the promontory of Land's End, and, after a brief 
expanse of ocean in which I was close enough to see gannets and shearwaters 
crisscrossing at water level, I was over the rocky southeast coast of St. 
Mary's, the largest of the Scillies, and dropping softly onto the grassy 
landing field. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes later, I was at Tregarthen's, surveying the quiet garden where, a 
discreet plaque said, Alfred Lord Tennyson, a regular guest in the hotel's 
early days, spent long hours writing "Enoch Arden." The view -- the long stone 
quay and the harbor, crowded with dinghies and small sailboats -- probably 
hadn't changed much in the intervening century, but since I had only five days, 
I didn't let it inspire me to write an epic poem and instead headed out to 
tramp the island. 
</P>
<P>
 I walked through Hugh Town, situated at a point where the island is squeezed 
together like an hourglass, with beaches facing the sea on either side, just 
three blocks apart. Sooner than I expected, I was out of town, past a pottery 
shop and a stately house named Nowhere and onto the Lower Moor. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere I looked, I could see people in motion -- walking or biking, singly 
or in family groups, silently plodding with canes and butterfly nets, or 
chatting -- or, in the case of many of the children, polishing their debating 
skills. "Pick it up, Tobin, pick it up like a nice little girl," I heard a 
mother implore from somewhere on the other side of a hedgerow. "I shan't," came 
the small-voiced but firm answer. "Colin," I heard from a father-voice behind 
me, "you mustn't keep doing that. You really mustn't keep sitting down." "And 
you really mustn't keep kicking me," in measured response. 
</P>
<P>
 I turned onto a rocky nature trail and met an elderly woman leaning on a 
walking stick. "Bit rough going here, isn't it," she observed. "Yes, but at 
least there's a nice cool breeze," I said, having just rolled down my 
shirt-sleeves. "Not here," she said, looking at me as though uncertain whether 
I'd tried to make a joke. "It's really rather hot." 
</P>
<P>
 By nightfall, I was back in my room, resting my aching feet and savoring the 
memory of the first of five sumptuous four-course meals I was to enjoy at the 
hotel, as well as an entertaining slide lecture by Wagstaff on the natural 
attractions of the Scillies. Then I began boning up on the "off-islands" (the 
catch-all term for those that aren't St. Mary's) in preparation for the one 
daily ritual that produces crowds on the Scillies: the morning gathering on the 
quay to board the boats that transport visitors to Tresco, St. Martin's, St. 
Agnes, Bryher or Samson. 
</P>
<P>
 Tresco is the jewel of the Scillies. It contains, on its 1-by-2-mile expanse 
of wooded hills and rolling moors, the islands' most interesting ruins -- a 
12th-Century Benedictine abbey and castles and fortifications from the 16th and 
17th Centuries -- and the Abbey Gardens, which contain native plants and 
flowers as well as hundreds of subtropical varieties gathered over the past two 
centuries from around the world. Tresco is the only island in private hands, 
the descendants of Augustus Smith, who was given a lease to the island by the 
Duchy of Cornwall in 1834. 
</P>
<P>
 As I walked a roadway on Tresco, a resident pointed out an 
aristocratic-looking gentleman driving by in a three-wheeled cart, the only 
kind of motor vehicle allowed on Tresco. It was Robert Dorrien Smith, the 
island's current lease-holder and resident of Tresco Abbey, not really an abbey 
but an imposing manor house built in 1843 near the original abbey's ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 To get to Tresco, I joined the crowd on the quay at St. Mary's about 9 a.m. 
and scanned a blackboard that lists the boats and their destinations for the 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 I joined 85 people and two dogs, squeezed onto every bit of horizontal space 
on a broad, open motorized boat called the Britannia. The docking sites on all 
the islands vary according to tides and, after a placid 15-minute voyage across 
a couple miles of flat sea, we landed at Cairn Near, on the southern tip of 
Tresco, the dock used at low tide. 
</P>
<P>
 With Wagstaff pointing out plants and birds and guiding us through a 
meandering network of trails, our group of a dozen walked the island. We 
studied the birds at two wooded ponds and found, in addition to the expected 
swans, herons and ducks, two very unexpected visitors from far away that would 
have excited even those British birding friends who shun the islands until 
October. They were a citrine wagtail, a pipit-like bird of Siberia and a 
semipalmated sandpiper, a shorebird common in the United States but rarely seen 
in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 We climbed a hill to see the gutted exterior of the Blockhouse, a stone 
fortification built in the 1500s and destroyed in the civil war in 1651 by 
supporters of Oliver Cromwell. To the north were the ruins of Cromwell's 
Castle, built in 1651, and King Charles' Castle, a century older. 
</P>
<P>
 Lunch at Tresco's only pub was Cornish pasties and ploughman's platters (salad 
of lettuce, cucumbers, beets and onions; two huge wedges of white Cheddar 
cheese, size depending on the cook's generosity; two generous slabs of coarse, 
fresh bread; dollops of mayonnaise and sour cream and a mound of pickle relish 
in a piquant brown sauce). For some of us, it was all washed down by a pint of 
aleand, for a hardy few, dessert followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should have been there one day last year," a woman at the next table said 
to me at supper back in the hotel that night when she heard me say I'd spent a 
quiet day on Tresco. "Police everywhere. They were dropping in by helicopter. A 
man had dug up some human bones and they thought somebody had been murdered. 
What a commotion. Then I heard on the telly later that it turned out the bones 
were more than a thousand years old. But I suppose it still could have been a 
murder." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night -- gig race night -- I sat with a group in Tregarthen's lounge, 
peering through the big picture window that usually provides a panoramic view 
of the harbor and the quay, the finish line for the St. Martin's-to-St. Mary's 
race that was supposed to be underway. But what we were looking at was an 
impenetrable fog that had rolled in while we ate, swallowing up the harbor, the 
spectator boats lined up at the finish line, the quay where hundreds more had 
gathered to watch, and most of the 200 yards of hillside between us and 
whatever action there was down below. 
</P>
<P>
 This prompted a round of storms- from- hell- that- really- screwed- things- 
up- for- visitors- to- the- Scillies stories from the regulars, amusing to them 
but enough to raise the consternation level of at least this visitor, with a 
nonrefundable ticket back to the States a few days hence. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the 1967 storm that broke up the Torrey Canyon on a reef just eight 
miles off the Scillies and loosed what was then a record oil spill. Although 
most of the oil washed eastward, away from the islands, some Scillies hotels 
still have mats in front of their doors that, instead of wishing "Welcome" 
inquire politely, "Tar?" 
</P>
<P>
 And there was the 1979 "Fastnet disaster," when a sudden storm exploded on a 
world-class yacht race as it passed the Scillies and, for days after, de-masted 
yachts were being dragged into the harbor, one of them having lost its entire 
seven-man crew. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the stories got closer to home: A storm five years ago, when two days of 
80 m.p.h. gales halted all departures from the islands, and the "big blow" of 
1990, when the Scillonian III, the 1,000-ton, 600-passenger ferry that is the 
island's commercial lifeline to the mainland, had to anchor off Land's End for 
three days riding out the storm, with a full complement of seasick 
holiday-goers aboard. 
</P>
<P>
 By now, mercifully, it was obvious something was happening out there in the 
fog. Some blinking lights were visible, and people were coming into view, 
returning from the quay. The gig race was over.

 Andreja, an effervescent Dubliner who is a musician with that city's National 
Symphony Orchestra, had joined one of the spectator boats that accompany the 
gigs in the race, each boatload selecting a favorite to root for. Her gig, the 
160-year-old Bonnet, rowed in the winner, "and we were pretty noisy, screaming 
away out there in the fog," she said later.

 When I arranged my visit to the Scillies months before, I'd wondered if five 
days wasn't too long to be spending on a little set of islands well out of the 
mainstream of activity. Now, as I packed my bags in the early morning darkness 
and prepared to leave, I thought of a dozen things I hadn't had time to do -- 
or things I wanted to do again. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd spent a day on St. Martin's, where tons of daffodils are grown for export 
in the mild winter months and fulmars and kittiwakes nest in cliffs topped by 
the Daymark, a red-and-white, torpedo-shaped tower that has stood there 
majestically since 1687 as a daytime navigation marker. But I hadn't made it to 
St. Agnes, or Bryher or Samson.

 I'd gone back to Tresco to visit the Abbey Gardens. And with Andreja and 
Petra, I'd taken a final hike through the moors and across the promontories of 
St. Mary's, and by now Petra, who also was leaving the next day, was 
unconsciously shifting back into a London mode, measuring time by the second 
again and urging us on, as if to meet a schedule.

 Tony, the hotel's headwaiter, had opened the dining room early to be sure I 
got a decent breakfast before leaving, and he saw me and my luggage to the stop 
for the heliport shuttle bus a block away. "Yes, people either like it or they 
don't," he'd observed philosophically to my declaration of full satisfaction 
with the Scillies.

 In a sparkling sky, the helicopter brought us back across the pale blue sea to 
Land's End and the fields of Cornwall and then Penzance. As it landed, I 
watched the waiting ground crew inexplicably putting on rain parkas and then as 
we stepped out onto the mainland once more, a suddenly dark sky erupted with a 
lashing downpour. As we dashed toward the terminal, the sun broke through and a 
beauteous rainbow formed, dropping down to the west.

 If I were a romantic, I would have said that the end of it seemed to drop into 
the sea right in the midst of the isles I'd just left. GUIDEBOOK: The Scillies:

 Getting there: From London's Paddington Station, 10 express trains a day make 
the five-hour trip to Penzance (about $60 one way); an overnight sleeper (about 
$120 one way) leaves at midnight and arrives at 8 a.m. From Penzance by sea, 
the Scillonian III (telephone 011-44-736-62009) makes one trip each way on 
weekdays, two on Saturday (none Sundays); one-way fare for the three-hour trip 
is about $45. British International Helicopters' 32-passenger aircraft make 
seven 20-minute flights on weekdays during summer, additional flights on 
Saturday (none Sundays); one-way fare is about $60, and there is a special $90 
round-trip fare for travel during specified times (tel. 011-44-736-63871). 
Reservations are essential in summer, and flights occasionally are delayed or 
canceled because of bad weather. (For the return trip, I made my train 
reservation for a few hours after the helicopter flight to allow for possible 
weather delay.)

 When to go: June through August is the best season for weather, and also the 
busiest. Spring and fall are said to be pleasant, but chillier, and storms are 
more likely.

 Where to stay: There are 10 hotels in the Scillies. Most rates include 
mandatory half-board -- full English breakfast plus dinner-although some accept 
guests for bed and breakfast at lower rates. Three hotels highly recommended by 
recent visitors are Star Castle (tel. 011-44-720-22317, fax 011-44-720-22343) 
atop Garrison Hill overlooking Hugh Town on St. Mary's (with tennis courts and 
heated swimming pool); Tregarthen's (tel. 011-44-720-22540, fax 
011-44-720-42089), halfway up the same hill and close to the harbor, with 
splendid views from public rooms, and Atlantic (tel. 011-44-720-22417, fax 
011-44-720-423009) on the waterfront in Hugh Town. Half-board rates at all are 
about $75 to $105 per person. There are about 70 smaller guest houses, offering 
varying meal arrangements. "Self-catering" accommodations -- apartments or 
rooms rented by the week, with no meals -- are booked up the earliest. The 
Scilly Tourist Information Center, listed below, publishes monthly computer 
printouts, beginning in the winter, showing what dates rooms are available at 
each of the islands' tourist accommodations.

 Where to eat: The hotels' dining rooms all seem to serve good food, and 
Tregarthen's, one of several open to non-guests, provided far more in its tasty 
four-course meals than I could do justice to. There are a number of restaurants 
that passed my sniff test and, on menus posted outside, had tempting daily 
specials, most of them based on local fish and produce. Some examples I jotted 
down: shark steak and Stilton; leek and Stilton soup; baked gray mullet with 
mussels; grilled brill with lime butter; cockles and (yes) mussels; fresh John 
Dory with parsnips; grilled plaice. There are also tea gardens that serve 
sinful pastries, with homemade jams and clotted cream. One of the best 
restaurants for scenery and sweets is Juliet's Garden, a short walk out of Hugh 
Town.

 For more information: The British Tourist Authority, 551 Fifth Ave., New York, 
N.Y. 10176; tel. (800) GO2-BRIT (462-2748), can provide basic information about 
the Scillies. Then contact the Tourist Information Center, St. Mary's, Isles of 
Scilly TR21 0JL, England (tel. 011-44-720-22536) for hotel and transportation 
specifics. I ordered the useful "Standard Guidebook to the Isles of Scilly" 
from them for $4; it describes each of the islands, and their roads and trails 
and gives information about the plant and animal life.
