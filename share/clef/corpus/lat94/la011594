FINAL BOARDING CALL; NOSTALGIA: HUNDREDS TURN OUT EARLY TO WATCH THE LAST TRAIN 
PULL OUT OF PASADENA'S PICTURESQUE STATION. THE DEPOT IS BEING CLOSED AND THE 
TRACKS CONVERTED FOR COMMUTER SERVICE.

<P>
 For 108 years, the tiny train station was a place of emotional farewells when 
people came to see their friends off. 
</P>
<P>
 The saddest came Friday, however, when hundreds turned out to say goodby to 
the Pasadena train depot itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The picturesque station, famed as a backdrop for movies and as a favored 
departure point for Hollywood stars, was closed so its tracks can be converted 
for a future commuter rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, the transcontinental Southwest Chief passenger train that 
stopped twice daily at the downtown Pasadena station will be rerouted through 
Orange County by its Amtrak operators. Start-up of the $847-million light-rail 
line is expected in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to preserve the station itself -- perhaps as a museum or 
community center. But it will be boarded up until its fate is decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 400 people showed up before dawn Friday to watch the last westbound 
passenger train pull into the station. Some brought cameras. Others brought 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very sad day," Altadena resident Paula Aghajanian said as she sat 
on a curb next to the tracks with son Gregory, 5, and daughter Lauren, 3. 
Gregory was wearing a pint-size conductor's hat and talking of becoming a train 
engineer when he grows up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Carlson, a Pasadena video distributor, was with 13-month-old Lindsay 
Johnston and her brother, Timothy, 3. "I was determined that my grandkids get 
to ride a train out of this station," Carlson said. "They may not remember it, 
but I will." 
</P>
<P>
 Near the rusty signal tower that once flagged down crews from trains with such 
proud names as the California Limited, El Capitan and the Grand Canyon Limited, 
Barbara Boekenoogen stood clutching a blowup of a photo of the station taken in 
1941 by her husband, Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Little seemed to have changed about the elegant little structure, built of 
stucco and concrete with a red tile roof and pastel-framed windows. It was 
constructed in 1935, the third depot building to serve the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the first Super Chief come through when I was a kid in the '30s," said 
Glenn Boekenoogen, a lithographer from Altadena. "I'll tell you, it was 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Bob Finan surveyed the lights shining from inside the station for the 
last time. The morning gloom around him matched his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swapped shifts with someone at work and got up at a quarter to 4 to come," 
said Finan, 41, a high-rise building engineer from West Los Angeles. "This is a 
melancholy day." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, ticket agent Susie Brown was experiencing something rarely seen during 
her seven years there: People clamoring for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 She was pleased that the depot's waiting room -- with polished wooden benches 
and ornate Western-style chandeliers beneath a ceiling of hand-hewn open beams, 
was busy on its last day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The roof leaks. And sometimes I think there are ghosts in here," said Brown, 
who will be transferred to Amtrak's Fullerton depot. "But this is a lovely 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the last train was late. Snowy weather encountered two days ago 
near its Chicago starting place was blamed. The crowd passed the time 
reminiscing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1930s and '40s, celebrities such as Clark Gable, Mae West, Will Rogers, 
Gary Cooper and Jeannette MacDonald favored the Pasadena station over the 
larger Union Station in Los Angeles, remembered Ralph Melching of the Pasadena 
Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 About 320 passengers were already aboard when the train finally pulled into 
Pasadena moments before 8 a.m. There was room for only 75 more to ride the last 
10 miles to Downtown Los Angeles. And only one true traveler was among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Smith, 20, of Monterey Park was headed for Seattle. "I didn't expect so 
many people would come to see me off," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The others, such as Barbara Sibert of Alhambra and Greg Gneier and Janine 
Duffy of Pasadena, were more subdued as they climbed aboard and took seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to miss the trains' whistle," said Thelma Vickroy. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally came Susie Brown's voice over the station loudspeaker: "And now, for 
the final time, this is the final boarding call. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 To the toot of its horn and the cheers of its friends, the train pulled out.

PROPOSED SUPER-AGENCY WOULD COORDINATE ECONOMIC PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to focus and improve Los Angeles' business promotion efforts, 
two top city administrators Friday released their plan to consolidate economic 
development operations from four departments into a new super-agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Economic Development Department could open as soon as April, 
if the City Council and Mayor Richard Riordan reaffirm their earlier conceptual 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The new agency would take over many responsibilities now assumed by the 
Community Redevelopment Agency, Community Development Department, Board of 
Public Works and Mayor's Office. It would be headed by a commission that would 
plot a business growth strategy and consolidate loan programs now divided among 
three offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization plan -- designed by city administrative officer Keith 
Comrie and chief legislative analyst Ron Deaton -- could cut the city work 
force by 42 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the need for such a centralized operation was demonstrated by 
another event Friday at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved a plan to divide $60 million in federal loan funds 
between housing construction and rehabilitation and programs for economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 More telling than the decision, several officials said, was the fact that the 
economic development component of the program has still not been defined, 11 
months after the federal government agreed to loan the city the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Such inertia would be averted by the new Economic Development Department, 
which would function as a clearinghouse for all pro-business initiatives in the 
city, proponents said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency would be run by a seven-member commission appointed by the mayor 
and confirmed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers said the consolidation would make it easier for business people and 
others to understand the city's economic development efforts and for the city 
to respond to changing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how we can be far more effective in articulating a vision for 
economic development and laying out a work plan to do it," said Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, who led the move to streamline the bureaucracy. "It's a 
recognition that what we have done to date has been inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's separate action Friday on the $60-million federal loan fund 
should also begin to instigate economic activity, council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal budget includes $2 billion for cities to borrow against future 
grants they will receive from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) had been instrumental in creating the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' $60-million share was approved in February for use throughout 
riot-torn neighborhoods. Since then, little has been done to spend the money, 
despite the region's continuing economic deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Housing Department stepped into the void, suggesting it could use 
as much as $40 million of the money to refurbish homes and to build new ones. 
The proposal was backed by Ridley-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Waters was disturbed that money would be diverted from economic 
development, which she considers the area's greatest need. "They had not 
developed any economic development programs," Waters said. "It was very 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Waters and city officials agreed to split the money between the 
housing programs and economic development. Waters said she agreed to the 
compromise because the housing work is ready to proceed, while the business 
plans are languishing. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing funds will help rehabilitate about 1,630 houses and apartments and 
build 375 new homes. Housing Department general manager Gary Squier said the 
work will have economic benefits of its own, creating jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This $30 million will enable the Housing Department to substantially turn 
around deteriorated pockets of the city,"' Squier said. "And that is essential 
at a time when the recession is destabilizing our rental housing stock." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer said Riordan's Administration is looking for ways to 
use the $30 million in economic development money. 
</P>
<P>
 The city does not have much time to dawdle. A specific plan must be submitted 
by Feb. 28 or HUD will cut off the funds.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS GET STREET-LEVEL VIEW ON VERMONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY and PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Testifying before government officials is often a stuffy affair in a sterile 
conference room. But on Friday, Tony Love and other small business owners along 
Vermont Avenue were able to share their views without having to leave their 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming to the front doors of their struggling businesses were members of the 
House of Representatives, the Clinton Administration and the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Love, who owns Sir Tony's Fashion, told the officials of his daily struggle to 
make a living and the difficulty he faces in getting loans. He said he has sold 
drugs, spent time in jail but had settled on a new enterprise -- 
entrepreneurship. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioning him from the sidewalk were two members of the House Banking 
Committee, Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros and Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by Waters, the tour was designed to examine the credit problems 
facing residents of the inner city as part of a review of the Community 
Reinvestment Act, which requires financial institutions to issue loans in their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Cisneros promised to assist in creating a commercial development 
plan for Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said he decided this week to appoint an aide to develop and 
implement an economic plan for Vermont. Cisneros said he will seek federal 
funds to help plan a commercial corridor along the struggling area of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said the funds might be funneled to Community Build, a South-Central 
Los Angeles community development organization that has received $3 million in 
HUD funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros brought along good news on another front when he announced that the 
city and county of Los Angeles, and the neighboring cities of Glendale and Long 
Beach, would be the site of the country's second "Homeless Initiative" and 
would receive a significant increase in funding for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no amount was specified, Washington, D.C., received $20 million over 
three years when it was selected last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that there are 80,000 homeless in Los Angeles County, which 
Cisneros called "one of the largest homeless populations in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which will drastically expand the $1 million that the city 
receives for emergency shelters, will focus on those who live in urban 
encampments, the mentally ill, homeless families and those who recently became 
homeless. The city and county recently combined their homeless initiatives in 
the new Los Angeles Services Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is terrific news for Los Angeles," said Riordan, who applied for the 
funding last month. 
</P>
<P>
 At a neighborhood association meeting held at a community center a few blocks 
from Waters' home, she complained about the lack of adequate city planning in 
the neighborhood, citing a Payless shoe store -- one of the few chain stores to 
build in the neighborhood since the riots -- as an eyesore.

L.A. SCHOOLS TRUMP BUILDER ON HOTEL SITE; COURTS: RULING IS A DEFEAT FOR DONALD 
TRUMP, WHO FOUGHT TO MAKE THE DISTRICT STICK TO ITS PLAN TO BUY AMBASSADOR 
SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 In a victory for the Los Angeles school district over developer Donald Trump, 
a court ruled Friday that the district is free to drop its bid to buy the 
historic Ambassador Hotel property, clearing the way for it to purchase another 
sorely needed high school site. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Barnet M. Cooperman threw out Trump-Wilshire 
Associates' lawsuit to force the school district to stick to its plans to buy 
the Ambassador from them. 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of elementary schoolchildren, the ruling means a new high school 
will be built closer to their homes in Downtown Los Angeles in four to five 
years, saving them from long bus rides to other campuses, district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The protracted battle over ownership and value of one of the city's most 
widely known landmarks is likely to be the focus of more court battles, as 
Trump representatives fight to keep the school district's $48-million deposit 
for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district has treated us terribly and has been extremely cavalier about 
this," said Trump spokeswoman Barbara Res. She said Trump's next step will be 
to sue the district for damages because it unfairly tied up the Wilshire 
corridor property. "We are going to end up with the lion's share of the $48 
million." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the district decided to walk away from its pursuit of the 
Ambassador land, citing its tight finances and the dramatic decline in real 
estate values. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the district has negotiated with another developer to buy a 
24-acre plot near Temple and Beaudry avenues Downtown. The state's school 
construction board gave the district tentative approval to buy the new site 
with $30 million of the $50 million it had allocated to buy the Ambassador. The 
district forfeited the remaining $20 million in construction funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump attorneys argued that the district should not renege on its plans 
because it unfairly hurts Trump's financial standing with the site. They 
claimed that he lost development opportunities while paying $1 million a month 
in maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an abuse of power. . . . They don't want to buy it now because it is 
too expensive," charged William M. Bitting, who said the district's real plan 
is to buy the property for less money at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 James W. Colbert, an O'Melveny & Myers attorney representing the district, 
argued that the contractual agreement with Trump allowed the district to drop 
the bid. He also contended that Trump has benefited from the interest-free use 
of the district's $48-million deposit on the land, which Trump used to help pay 
off the mortgage. Trump paid $64 million for the site in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperman sided with the district, saying that Trump-Wilshire Associates had 
not proven that its financial position with the site has worsened. He said 
Trump has the right to seek damages through other court avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friday ruling forces Trump to refund the district's deposit with interest 
within a year. However, litigation could stall or prevent the pay-back if a 
judge later rules that Trump has been hurt by the district's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials put up district headquarters as collateral to obtain the 
$48-million loan for the deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990 the district has been fighting with Trump over the value of the 
Ambassador site. Trump set its worth at more than $110 million. The district 
offered $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
 When the parties failed to agree on the price, the district used its authority 
to take property through eminent domain proceedings, which give government 
entities the power to buy land from property owners for fair market value. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the early fight, school board members were adamant about the need 
to build a high school in the area, where about 3,000 Mid-Wilshire teen-agers 
are bused to Valley and Westside high schools because their neighborhood 
schools are overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides were headed for trial this fall to determine the cost. Under state 
laws, the jury would be required to set the Ambassador price at land values in 
1990, when eminent domain proceedings began. With today's depressed real estate 
market, the district would have faced the likelihood of paying an inflated 
price for the land.

PROSECUTORS WON'T ACT AND JUDGE WON'T BUDGE; COURTS: U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
SAYS IT HAS NO CASE AGAINST A MAN WHO SAYS HE BROUGHT GUN INTO COURTHOUSE BY 
MISTAKE. BUT AN ANGRY JURIST HAS KEPT HIM IN JAIL SINCE OCT. 4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though prosecutors decided a month ago they have no case against him, a 
63-year-old man who carried a loaded .357 magnum into a Los Angeles federal 
courthouse remains jailed because an angry judge is refusing on principle to 
dismiss the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir Flint was arrested Oct. 4 after federal marshals seized the gun he 
was carrying in a portfolio as he passed through a metal detector at a Downtown 
courthouse. In mid-October, he was ordered held without bail as a flight risk 
and a trial date was set. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Dec. 13, one day before Flint was to go on trial, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Alicia Amador told U.S. District Judge David W. Williams that the charge should 
be dismissed because the government had less of a case than it originally 
believed. "We initially indicted the case because we didn't know a whole lot 
about the defendant," Amador said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought he could be a foreign national. We thought that he could be an 
assassin. We didn't know why he was here in the courthouse."  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Flint, a Nicaraguan native, is a naturalized U.S. citizen, Amador 
said. He had come to the courthouse on legitimate business involving his 
bankruptcy case and had simply forgotten to leave the gun in his car, Amador 
said. The law requires that the government prove that Flint knowingly entered 
the courthouse with a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, however, called Amador's explanation "baloney" and accused the U.S. 
attorney's office of taking the matter too lightly. "It's a very serious 
offense for . . . a person to bring a gun in the courthouse. Judges have been 
shot. Witnesses have been shot," Williams said from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it appears likely that Flint will be freed by the end of the month, 
the standoff has mushroomed into a cause celebre from Los Angeles to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The escalation began the day after the mid-December court hearing, when Amador 
filed a written declaration once again urging dismissal. She said Flint's 
neighbor told her that Flint had been rushing to go to the courthouse that day 
and inadvertently brought with him a gun that he sleeps with for protection 
against crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams sharply questioned whether it was an innocent mistake, noting that 
the weapon was placed in a sock and wrapped in a plastic bag. Amador countered 
that Flint regularly wrapped up the gun and kept it buried in his Lennox back 
yard during the daytime. 
</P>
<P>
 Amador, 32, who joined the U.S attorney's office in 1992, had the backing of 
her bosses. One of them, Steven G. Madison, told the judge that under Justice 
Department guidelines, prosecutors have an ethical obligation to drop a case 
"if at any time we believe that there is a doubt about the defendant's guilt, 
irrespective of what we think a jury might do." 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams, 83, a 24-year veteran of the federal bench, again refused to 
dismiss the indictment, steadfastly maintaining that a jury was entitled to 
hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 After the government filed a notice of appeal, Williams became so infuriated 
that he wrote to U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and asked her to dispatch a special 
prosecutor to handle the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision not to prosecute is too important to be made by a reasonably 
inexperienced assistant U.S. attorney backed up by her two lame duck superiors, 
who will leave office in two weeks," he wrote. Reno has not responded, but 
Justice Department sources say she will not grant the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not unusual for Justice Department lawyers to drop a 
prosecution, the Flint case is unique, according to all sides. No one 
associated with the case can remember a judge accusing federal prosecutors of 
being insufficiently aggressive. In fact, the reverse has often been the case 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Flint, confined in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Downtown Los Angeles, 
was not available to discuss his case. But there were plenty of emotional 
comments from judges, U.S. attorneys and the federal public defender's office, 
which is representing Flint. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is inconceivable that the government will not prosecute a case such as 
this one that goes to the heart of law and order in the house of law and 
order," U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler wrote to Williams, applauding 
his stand. "We may want to barricade the front door, purchase our own 
magnetometer and perhaps carry our own side arm!" 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian also expressed outrage at the U.S. 
attorney's office: "They really are saying, 'You judges are expendable,' " 
Tevrizian said. "This sends the wrong message to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But another federal judge, speaking anonymously, was bewildered by Williams' 
actions. The judge suggested that Williams may be overly sensitive because the 
incident occurred in his own back yard -- the Edward R. Roybal federal 
building, where Williams has his chambers. "If this had been a prosecution of 
someone going into the Metropolitan Detention Center or a post office, I don't 
think he would have reacted this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Then-U.S. Atty. Terree A. Bowers told Reno in a Dec. 20 letter that he knew 
the office's decision had been controversial, particularly because the Justice 
Department's No.1 priority is "combatting violent crime." But he maintained 
that it was correct. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand that there is greater concern with these types of cases because 
of a spate of recent random shootings that have received considerable 
publicity. . . . While I understand our district court judge's concern with the 
security of the courthouse, we cannot allow such visceral reactions to override 
our obligations to see that justice is served." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers also told Reno "that on a fairly regular basis, individuals enter our 
courthouses having forgotten to remove a weapon from a satchel or briefcase. It 
is up to the Federal Protective Service and this office to determine who should 
be prosecuted criminally. Virtually all individuals are simply cited for an 
infraction ($50 fine), and released." 
</P>
<P>
 The new U.S. attorney, Nora M. Manella, has picked up where Bowers left off. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we discover information that leads us to have substantial doubt as to a 
defendant's guilt, we take whatever steps may be necessary, consistent with our 
ethical obligations, to prevent a miscarriage of justice," Manella said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she told Williams she understood his concerns -- "It remains of 
primary importance to us that the federal judges be protected and feel 
protected" -- but said the office was honor bound not to try the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria E. Stratton, the chief federal public defender in Los Angeles, 
frequently clashes with the U.S. attorney's office, but she praised her 
traditional adversaries for continuing their investigation and seeking a 
dismissal: "I have to credit them for going toe to toe with the judge. I 
thought it was terrific the way they didn't back down." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stratton said she is outraged that Flint is still in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 He may not be for long, though. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, responding to a motion from the U.S. attorney's office, the U.S. 
9th Circuit Court of Appeals paved the way for Flint to be released. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney had appealed Williams' refusal to dismiss the case. 
Ironically, that had the effect of keeping Flint in jail as long as the appeal 
was pending. So earlier this month, the prosecutors asked for permission to 
withdraw their appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 That request was granted Thursday and will send the case back where the 
controversy began -- Williams' courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Manella said the U.S. attorney's office will renew its request to drop the 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 If Williams again refuses, the U.S. attorney's office will decline to put on a 
case, Manella said, and under the federal Speedy Trial Law, Flint should be 
released within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he still believes the case should be tried, but acknowledged 
that although he can refuse to dismiss the case, he does not have the power to 
make the U.S. attorney's office bring it to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hands are tied. I can't put on witnesses." He said that if the U.S. 
attorney does not change her mind, he will bring the case to a close. "I don't 
think he (Flint) should stay in jail forever."

JUDGE AGREES TO RESENTENCE SINGER'S FIANCEE IN DRUG AND ASSAULT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid allegations that a district attorney's investigator provided drugs to a 
key witness, a judge Friday agreed to resentence funk singer Rick James' 
fiancee for assaulting another woman in a sensational drug and assault case. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff set aside a four-year sentence 
given to Tanya Anne Hijazi, in light of a deal that James struck with 
prosecutors that could have him out of jail by September. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoff's decision comes in the midst of what sources say is an investigation 
into allegations that a district attorney's investigator provided drugs to a 
key witness in the case against James and Hijazi. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijazi had pleaded guilty to assaulting a woman in a Sunset Boulevard hotel 
while James watched. In a plea bargain negotiated Aug. 11, she admitted 
attacking Mary Sauger of West Hollywood at the St. James' Club and hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijazi was sentenced to four years in prison on Sept. 21, four days after 
James was convicted of assaulting Sauger, 35, and of providing drugs to another 
woman who alleged that she was tortured.

 Decent exposure: Journal of the Senses, the Elysium Institute's publication, 
shows its followers standing by an "Adopt a Highway/Litter Removal" sign, which 
the group is sponsoring. The members of the nudist colony even made the supreme 
sacrifice of finding some clothes to wear while working. They no doubt figured 
that drivers on Topanga Canyon Boulevard are erratic enough.

 The first cookie opening: As we have often noted, L.A. has claimed its share 
of culinary inventions -- the chili size (Ptomaine Tommy's), the cheeseburger 
(short-order cook Lionel Sternberger), the Shirley Temple cocktail (Brown 
Derby), and the Moscow mule (Cock 'n' Bull), among others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smithsonian magazine reminds us that L.A. should be credited with another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fortune cookie is indisputably American," writes Stanley Karnow in the 
January issue. "It was invented in 1916 by David Jung, a Los Angeles noodle 
manufacturer." Karnow says Jung "borrowed the idea from the practice among 
ancient Chinese rebels of exchanging covert messages inside buns." 
</P>
<P>
 One country that has long spurned the prophetic dessert, by the way, is China. 
But, Karnow adds, a state-owned company in Canton will soon be churning out 
fortune cookies. The factory is being built by a noodle company from that 
well-known suburb of Beijing, Brooklyn.

 Luckily, he has a thick skin: Even if it is an L.A. invention, Joe Roubal of 
Marina del Rey has lost faith in the sagacity of the fortune cookie. He sent 
along a message he found in a take-out order, adding that so far "no fruit or 
vegetable has shown me the slightest sign of respect."

</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, other books quote Mencken as having said that L.A. "stank of 
orange blossoms." We wonder if his nose ever made up its mind about our fair 
city.

 Some roadways have turnouts that are observation spots. The Santa Monica

feature turnouts that are Accident Investigation Sites. The 12 screened-off

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: PRISON INMATE'S ESCAPE 
IN GARBAGE TRUCK BACKFIRES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHIL SNEIDERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 25-year-old inmate was back in custody Friday after escaping from a state 
prison in Lancaster by stowing away inside a garbage truck -- only to wind up 
compacted into a bale of trash and dumped in a landfill, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured prisoner, Steven Charles Brigida, called for help Thursday morning 
as a landfill tractor closed in on the trash mound in which he had been 
discarded. The startled driver saw the inmate floundering in the garbage heap, 
slammed on his brakes and summoned his supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigida, who was sent to prison for shooting a California Highway Patrol 
officer in 1987, was turned over to prison guards and Los Angeles County 
sheriff's deputies. 
</P>
<P>
 He was in satisfactory condition Friday at Antelope Valley Hospital Medical 
Center, where he was treated for several broken ribs, a spokesman for the 
California State Prison at Lancaster said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigida was serving a sentence of life plus eight years for attempted murder, 
auto theft and burglary, spokesman Kenn I. Hicks said. The district attorney's 
office will be asked to file charges stemming from the escape, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigida is lucky to have survived in a truck that compresses garbage into a 
bale four or five times smaller than the original load, said Mike Muller, 
general manager of Waste Management of Lancaster, which operates the dump. 
</P>
<P>
 "The load comes out (shaped) like a loaf of bread," Muller said. "He was 
fortunate he was in the middle of the load." 
</P>
<P>
 Brigida apparently had climbed inside a prison garbage bin that was hoisted 
above a truck and dumped into the vehicle. Prison guards always escort trash 
trucks in and out of the facility, but apparently did not see Brigida drop into 
the vehicle, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 After landfill workers discovered the injured inmate, the prison began an 
emergency inmate count and lock-down and determined that an escape had 
occurred, Hicks said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prison houses about 4,000 prisoners. Hicks said the staff is investigating 
to determine how Brigida was able to hide in one of the garbage bins, which are 
stored in a restricted area. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's incident was the fourth escape since the prison opened in February, 
1993. In July, two minimum-security prisoners walked away from their barracks 
but were quickly recaptured. In October, a murderer escaped by scaling a block 
wall and two chain-link fences without being seen by guards. He was recaptured 
about five hours later outside a market, several miles from the prison. PHIL

LIBEL AWARD AGAINST NEWSPAPER SET ASIDE; COURTS: JUDGE RULES VERDICT 
INCONSISTENT AND $7.5-MILLION DAMAGE AWARD EXCESSIVE AND ORDERS RETRIAL OF 
BUSINESSMAN'S CLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles judge ruled Friday that a $7.5-million libel award was excessive 
and ordered a new trial in a lawsuit by Beverly Hills attorney-businessman 
Leonard M. Ross against the Santa Barbara News-Press and its owner, the New 
York Times Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Harvey A. Schneider also ruled that the jury verdict was 
flawed by internal inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In his eight-page opinion, Schneider rejected a motion for a defense verdict 
-- refusing to rule that Ross had not been libeled. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said he agreed with "the jury's conclusion that the defendants were 
negligent, in some respects." But in ordering a new trial, Schneider said that 
was not "a sufficient basis for upholding a verdict that is inconsistent and 
excessive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in October had awarded Ross the damages after a four-week trial 
involving investigative articles on Ross' business career. Among other things, 
Ross contended that the Santa Barbara paper falsely linked him to the misdeeds 
of his former partner, investment whiz Barry Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gratified that the court has reversed the jury's unjustified verdict," 
said Rex Heinke, a lawyer for the News-Press, the New York Times and their 
co-defendants, reporter Kathleen Sharp and editor David McCumber. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony M. Glassman, Ross' attorney, said he will file a motion for 
reconsideration because "we think the judge has made an error." If Schneider 
refuses to reinstate the judgment, Glassman said he probably will challenge 
Friday's ruling before the state Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Filed more than four years ago, the lawsuit stems from articles in November, 
1988, and February, 1989, that Ross said ruined his efforts to establish a new 
business and social life in Santa Barbara. The reports described the business 
career of the man who had become the largest shareholder in Santa Barbara 
Savings & Loan, then the city's largest financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, 49, contended that the articles contained four false statements and had 
a defamatory "tenor and tone." After deliberating 3 1/2 days, jurors agreed 
that three disputed statements were false, and awarded damages of $5 million 
for harm to Ross' reputation and $2.5 million for emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of Ross' claim was that the reports falsely linked him to two 
federal criminal investigations that took place in the 1970s, early in his 
business career, although in fact he was investigated only once. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that the newspaper correctly stated he was investigated -- but 
not charged -- by a federal grand jury, the FBI and the Organized Crime Strike 
Force in the early 1970s in an alleged extortion attempt against his former 
partner, Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ross contended -- and jurors agreed -- that the paper falsely linked him 
to a subsequent investigation of investor fraud that sent Marlin to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 It was here, however, that Schneider found the inconsistencies in the jury's 
answers to a series of special-verdict questions. While jurors said Ross had 
proven that "the tenor and tone" of the first report was that Ross was 
investigated along with Marlin for investor fraud, they elsewhere said Ross had 
not proven the falsity of a specific statement that linked him to the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 In ruling the award excessive, Schneider noted that jurors awarded $2.5 
million for emotional distress, although Ross never sought professional 
counseling and "there was no testimony . . . that he suffered severe or 
permanent harm." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Schneider said, "the court is mindful of the chilling effect that 
such an award would have on First Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also found Ross was libeled by a statement suggesting that he had 
arranged an auto accident that severely injured his former lawyer, Lynn Boyd 
Stites, with whom Ross had had a falling out. Coincidentally, Schneider's 
ruling in the Ross case came a day after Stites was sentenced in federal court 
in San Diego to more than 12 years in prison for masterminding an elaborate 
insurance fraud.

A SPORTING CHANCE; PARALYZED ATHLETE PRESENTED WITH SPECIAL HONOR FOR BEING AN 
INSPIRATION TO OTHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Martin Hernandez is not bitter, or even angry. But sometimes, he says, seeing 
a baseball "gets me a little bit down." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 19, was an aspiring baseball player and police officer when he was 
wounded in a drive-by shooting last January that left him paralyzed from the 
waist down. But with the same indomitable spirit that made him a standout 
athlete, Hernandez is determined to overcome his injury and move on with his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 While undergoing therapy at Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey, he 
kept up with his studies and graduated with classmates at Leuzinger High School 
in Lawndale last June. Now a mass communications major at El Camino College 
near Torrance, Hernandez also finds time to play wheelchair basketball and 
tennis and to continue serving as a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition of his accomplishments, Colours 'N Motion, an Anaheim-based 
wheelchair manufacturer, joined Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block on 
Friday in presenting Hernandez with a specially designed lightweight wheelchair 
made of aluminum. The chair is easier to maneuver, especially on a basketball 
or tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to improve my ability to play sports, and most of the things I'm 
trying to accomplish," Hernandez said of his new gift, presented during a brief 
ceremony at the Audrey and Sidney Irmas Youth Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you very much," Hernandez said. "I won't let you down. I'm going to 
keep improving myself more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Box, owner of Colours 'N Motion who himself was paralyzed after a 
motorcycle accident in 1981, said he first learned about Hernandez during a 
conversation with Block in November and wanted to do something for the young 
man. Box said the wheelchair, which he designed and would normally cost about 
$1,800, will enable Hernandez to play a variety of sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are proud to make this donation," Box said. "He deserves it." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's brother Alberto, 22, stood a few feet away, beaming. "After the 
accident, I thought he would give up," Alberto Hernandez said. "But he hasn't. 
It's taught me a lesson. Never give up on your dreams. No matter what happens, 
just keep on going." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Hernandez of Inglewood was standing with a group of friends outside a 
party in Hawthorne last Jan. 22 when he was struck by a bullet fired from a 
passing car. The bullet pierced his chest, just missed his heart and lodged in 
his spine, crippling him for life. 
</P>
<P>
 The news shattered family members, who had watched him work hard at baseball 
in hopes it could be a ticket to higher education. Hernandez, a B student who 
took advanced classes, had been trying to obtain such a baseball scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hernandez said his ultimate goal was to become a sheriff's deputy, "to 
help people out anyway I can." A 1992 graduate of the sheriff's Explorer 
program, he was working at the Lennox station at the time he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes him extra special is that here is a young man in the very prime of 
his life who was cut down," Block said. "It would have been very easy for him 
to give up. Instead, he was determined to fight this. I think he is an 
inspiration not only to other young people but to all of us." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Block said that the two individuals responsible for Hernandez's injury were 
arrested and convicted of the crime, with one now serving a 16-year sentence 
and the other a seven-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said he is not angry at his assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a grudge against anybody," he said. "I just hope they learned 
their lesson, just by seeing what they did, by realizing what they did was 
wrong and making a change. That would be the best thing that could happen. 
Instead of them getting out of jail and doing the same thing."

CHURCHES TRYING TO BRING 'BABY BUSTERS' BACK INTO THE FOLD; YOUTH: SPECIAL 
SERVICES AND OUTREACH EFFORTS ARE AIMED AT 18-TO-35 AGE GROUP NOT SERVED BY 
FAMILY MINISTRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Ed Young is not afraid to throw a football at "baby busters" in his 
Southern Baptist church. Other churches will schedule special services just for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Roman Catholic Church, seeking to capitalize on the success of World 
Youth Day last summer, recently decided to develop a national pastoral plan for 
its 18- to 35-year-old members. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the in-between generation, many of whom have left the sanctum of 
religious youth education but have not found their place in churches that 
emphasize family ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, many churches were resigned to losing some youths in their early 
20s, writing them off as part of a youthful search for independence that would 
end with their return after marriage when they would seek a religious home for 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 But new research shows that in an increasingly secular society where the 
traditional two-parent family and social pressures for religious affiliation 
are declining, there are no guarantees that baby busters will ever return. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, religious groups are learning new ways to attract and keep young 
adults in the pews. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to build on the enthusiasm of the tens of thousands of high school 
students who attended World Youth Day called by Pope John Paul II in Denver, 
U.S. Catholic bishops recently approved a three-year project to develop 
ministry programs for young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that the development of a ministry for this age group will say loud 
and clear that not only is there a place for young adults in the Catholic 
Church, but there is also a need for them to take on more responsibility for 
what the church does," said Msgr. Dennis Schnurr, executive director of World 
Youth Day. "We're not about to squander the idealism and enthusiasm we saw at 
World Youth Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Henderson, a national youth specialist for the Catholic Church, said many 
young adults have said they are looking for a sense of belonging in a church 
that often orients its ministries to families. 
</P>
<P>
 They do not necessarily have to lead the parish council, he said. "A lot of 
times, it's something much more simple -- just to be acknowledged that they're 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some important differences in the baby buster generation, church 
leaders say. In general, they are waiting longer to marry, postponing a natural 
port of entry into the church when they have children. 
</P>
<P>
 And clergy can forget about many members of the 22-to-35 age group sticking 
around if there are no programs for their age groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to jump in with both feet," said the Rev. Linda Grenz, coordinator 
of adult education for the Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Some successful ministries for young adults include offering four- to six-week 
classes that give them lots of options and do not force them to make long-term 
commitments, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some churches even create "parallel congregations" to offer services for baby 
boomers and busters that give them the environment and music that is meaningful 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are not involved in the church by the third or fourth visit, young 
adults may look elsewhere, Grenz said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Fellowship of Las Colinas in a Dallas suburb, Young does not even wait 
that long to get people involved. After their first visit, he enlists young 
adults in such ministries as greeting people in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Young also keeps his services under an hour, and uses videotape and drama to 
get his message across to young adults. On "Cowboy Days," Young may dress in a 
football uniform and throw a pigskin into the seats at services. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they sometimes seem like a demanding generation, they also can be 
rewarding to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited about this age group because they're spontaneous. They're 
fun to talk to and they add a lot of excitement to the church," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an enthusiasm for the faith. At the same time, there is a certain 
frustration . . . what are the channels" for participation, Schnurr said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he sees change occurring. The Second Vatican Council gave the laity an 
increased role in several ministries. Although older adults tended to be the 
first to take on those roles, Schnurr said, the church has gone through a 
generation of increased lay participation and "the young adults are beginning 
to make their presence known."

AILING HEIR TO MORMON PRESIDENCY BACK AT POST; SUCCESSION: IF THE 86-YEAR-OLD 
SENIOR APOSTLE IS TOO ILL TO ASSUME LEADERSHIP, IT WILL LEAVE CHURCH IN 
'TERRIBLE QUANDARY,' OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 He is frail and cannot walk without help, but the 86-year-old heir to the 
mantle of prophet to more than 8 million Mormons worldwide is back at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard W. Hunter, president of the Council of the 12 Apostles, spent nearly 
six months recuperating from gallbladder surgery in May. He has made the trip 
from his home to the church's Administration Building almost daily for the past 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of Hunter's health is critical to the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, whose president, Ezra Taft Benson, 94, has been frail for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The church will not comment on Benson's condition except in the vaguest terms. 
However, this summer, his grandson, Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist 
Steve Benson said the church president is confined to his apartment under a 
nurse's care. Age, he said, has stilled the elder Benson's voice and clouded 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter's health is also a concern because at no time in the faith's 163-year 
history has a designated successor been too frail or sick to assume the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a situation would leave the church "in a terrible quandary," and not just 
for ecclesiastical reasons, said D. Michael Quinn, author of an upcoming book 
on the Mormon hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 The governing First Presidency -- made up of Benson and his two counselors -- 
has become the center of the faith's multibillion-dollar corporate structure, 
Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Church presidents serve for life and are chosen through a strict tradition of 
apostolic succession based on seniority within the Council of the 12 Apostles. 
If the senior apostle, in this case Hunter, were mentally disabled, either 
through age or for some other reason, there is no doctrinal precedent for 
filling the role and the corporation could founder. 
</P>
<P>
 But the church may not be faced with that dilemma. Those close to Hunter, who 
suffered a recent bout of the flu, say that his overall health is relatively 
good. "He's doing remarkably well," said Hunter's son, Richard, of San Jose, 
Calif. "I find it incredible, bouncing back the way he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hunter and church spokesman Don LeFevre said that for the past month 
or so, the senior Hunter has been at the office "virtually every day," often 
working six or seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has felt well enough to attend his regular meetings and to handle his 
responsibilities as president of the Council of 12 Apostles from his office," 
LeFevre said in a statement. Hunter declined to be interviewed, as did other 
council members.  
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, a Boise, Ida., native and a corporate attorney who lived in Los 
Angeles for more than 30 years before moving here, has suffered a variety of 
ailments: a heart attack, bypass surgery and weakened legs that have forced him 
to use a walker. He spends much of his time in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Hunter lost his balance and fell while speaking at the church's 
general conference. He pulled himself back to the podium and completed the 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
 His health problems and the loss of his first wife in 1983 led to a bout with 
depression. He remarried in 1990, at age 82. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter requires help getting into his walker, Richard Hunter said, although 
sometimes he can push himself up from a sitting position. 
</P>
<P>
 His most serious problems came last spring when he went into the hospital for 
a gallbladder operation. Hunter's condition deteriorated after the May 10 
surgery and he spent four weeks in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we all would have hoped the recovery would have happened more 
quickly," Richard Hunter said. "But before the surgery, he was told then that 
he wouldn't be doing what he's doing now, so you have to measure by that." 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every conversation about Hunter includes the caveat, "For a man of 
his age . . . " It is no secret that his 86 years have left him physically 
frail, although apparently mentally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter was named to the council in 1959. If he becomes president, he will be 
the first Mormon leader born in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon B. Hinckley, 83, Benson's first counselor, follows Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Since church founder Joseph Smith's murder in 1844, the 11 presidents before 
Benson averaged 85 years of age at death. The average age today of the 
three-member First Presidency and the Council of the 12 Apostles is 74. 
</P>
<P>
 When a church president dies, the First Presidency is dissolved and the 
council and former counselors meet in the Salt Lake Temple to ordain the new 
president. He picks his counselors, and the trio immediately execute a variety 
of documents that ensure a smooth transition. 
</P>
<P>
 That could not happen if the senior apostle were mentally incapacitated, Quinn 
said. In the 19th Century, the church was able to operate without a First 
Presidency, and did so on three occasions. It would be more difficult, if not 
impossible, for that to happen now. 
</P>
<P>
 Given his understanding of Hunter's health, Quinn said a change in leadership 
now would be relatively uneventful.

 The life and work of civilrights leader Martin Luther King Jr. will be 
celebrated Sunday and Monday at Occidental College in Los Angeles with an 
interfaith observance and conference titled "Building a Human Rights Agenda for 
the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) will kick off the 
conference at 8 p.m. Sunday with a keynote address, "Human Rights and the 
Legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr." Norton has served two terms in 
Congress and chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under 
President Jimmy Carter. She is a professor of law at Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Crahan, Luce professor of religion, power and the political process 
at Occidental, said she organized the conference at the request of students 
because "although many human rights crises were resolved in the '60s, '70s and 
'80s, new crises around the world now threaten the survival of democracy in the 
21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 After a 9 a.m. session Monday of student-led panels on human rights concerns, 
there will be a discussion from 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. of some proposals on civil 
and human rights, and environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The panelists include Ilene Cohn, election officer for the U.N. Observer 
Mission in El Salvador; Clarence J. Dias, president of the International Center 
for Law and Development; Abdullahi An-Na'im, executive director of Africa 
Watch; Jan Urban, activist with the Center for Independent Journalism; William 
Weinberger, co-chairman of the National Lesbian and Gay Law Assn.; Carol Lujan, 
assistant professor in the School of Justice Studies at Arizona State 
University; Dorothy Thomas, director of the Women's Rights Project of Human 
Rights Watch, and Ellen Lutz, California director of Human Rights Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Crahan will lead a 7 p.m. discussion of international perspectives on human 
rights. Joining some of the afternoon panelists will be Elizabeth Lira, 
executive director of the Latin American Institute of Mental Health and Human 
Rights; Eric Goldstein, research director of Middle East Watch, and Elahe 
Sharif-Pour, an attorney with the U.N. International Civilian Human Rights 
Monitoring Mission in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Preceding the conference is an interfaith celebration, "Reflections on the 
Dream," at 1 p.m. Sunday. The Rev. John M. Perkins, author and founder of the 
John M. Perkins Foundation for Reconciliation and Development and the Harambee 
Christian Family Center in Pasadena, will be the keynote speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental College is at 1600 Campus Road, Eagle Rock. The interfaith 
celebration will be held at Herrick Memorial Chapel and Interfaith Center (213) 
259-2621. The conference will be at Thorne Hall (213) 259-2677. The conference 
is free and open to the public.

PERSPECTIVES / LETTERS; HOORAY FOR YOUTHS PLEDGING CHASTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was refreshing to read that thousands of youth all over America are saving 
sex for marriage. ("Youths at Baptist Convention Pledge Chastity Till 
Marriage," Jan. 8). 
</P>
<P>
 In the '60s, the saying was "never trust anyone over 30." Perhaps teens today 
could say the same thing. So many adults in their lives, including authority 
figures, say the young can't control their sexual urges and must be medicated, 
fitted and rubberized. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps these youngsters see through the "safe sex" message because sexually 
transmitted diseases are now epidemic in our country. Today there are about 20 
significant STDs (compared to two 30 years ago). . . . Sixty-three percent of 
new infections occur in the under-25 age group. 
</P>
<P>
 The teens who are taking the Chastity Pledge have decided not to listen to 
their unwise elders -- including Dr. Joycelyn Elders, surgeon general. Hooray!

JUDGE SENDS EXACTLY THE RIGHT MESSAGE; HATE-MONGERING SKINHEADS FEEL THE FULL 
FORCE OF THE LAW -- AND THEREFORE JUSTICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two young skinheads who plotted to ignite a race war in Southern California 
will now spend years in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher David Fisher, 20, and Carl Daniel Boese, 17, pleaded guilty to 
conspiracy charges stemming from a federal investigation of their racist and 
violent activities. U.S. District Judge William Matthew Byrne Jr. refused to 
coddle them. He sentenced Fisher, a leader of the Fourth Reich Skinheads, to 
eight years and Boese to nearly five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Those appropriate sentences should put others who hate on notice: If they 
break the law, they will not get off lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 The youth of Fisher and Boese cannot excuse what they did with other members 
of their hate group. They used pipe bombs and Molotov cocktails against homes 
and synagogues; they plotted to attack the historic First African Methodist 
Episcopal Church, kill prominent African Americans, murder Jews, blow up 
Asians, harm Latinos. They served as lookouts for other criminals. They spewed 
hatred and, worse, they acted on their beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 They were serious and they had the means -- guns and explosives -- to maim and 
murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Before anyone was killed -- and that was their racist group's avowed aim -- a 
federal investigation into weapons trafficking by white supremacists stopped 
the plotting. Agents of the FBI, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and 
Firearms and Los Angeles police made arrests in July before Fisher, Boese and 
others could put more of their murderous plans into action. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were sending absolutely the wrong message," Judge Byrne said. 
"Hopefully, what occurs in this courtroom sends a different kind of message." 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor, Assistant U.S. Atty. Marc R. Greenberg, is satisfied with the 
sentences. He can also take pride in the unusual counseling that he initiated 
last month for Fisher, Boese and others associated with the skinhead group. 
During three days of emotional sessions they met with Holocaust survivors, a 
black federal judge, Jewish and other minority students, rabbis and the black 
minister they had plotted to assassinate at First AME -- the Rev. Cecil Murray, 
who put his beliefs into practice when he forgave them. They also toured the 
Simon Weisenthal Center's Museum of Tolerance, watched the Holocaust movie 
"Schindler's List" and visited the Men's Central Jail, where inmates warned 
them to change. 
</P>
<P>
 Boese seemed less than guilt-ridden about the consequences of his hatred, but 
Fisher appeared contrite, tearfully voicing remorse at the sentencing. 
Regardless of the defendants' demeanor, their tough sentences will warn others 
who share their awful beliefs.

LIFTING VIETNAM TRADE EMBARGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I agree with your editorial, "Vietnam Trade: Time for the Leap" (Jan. 5). It 
is time to end the U.S. economic embargo of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Our government initiated the embargo against North Vietnam in 1964 and against 
the entire country in 1975. It has been kept in place since then ostensibly to 
punish its government for its intransigence and non-cooperation with the MIA 
issue. Our current policy needs to be revised not only because it hasn't worked 
but also because it is becoming obvious that the Vietnamese are being as 
forthcoming and cooperative as can reasonably be expected.

 On Jan. 6 the United States launched its biggest search ever in Vietnam for 
Americans missing in action. The Vietnamese have turned over uncounted tons of 
evidence, records, personal effects and remains of the missing. They have 
allowed continuous and thorough investigations of all air crash sites and 
so-called "live sightings" reports. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when the U.S.-led embargo really hurt Vietnam. That is no 
longer the case. The rest of the world long ago disregarded the embargo and 
began to make large-scale investment and trade with Vietnam a high priority.  
</P>
<P>
 I traveled to Vietnam this last summer as part of a delegation of Vietnam 
veterans and others interested in healing the wounds of that war. We came away 
from that experience convinced that the people there bear us no ill will. They 
want to put the bad times behind us -- they want to be friends. What made me 
sad was the realization that while the embargo seems to have had little impact 
on the way that their government makes its decisions, it nevertheless has an 
injurious effect on the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Without question, Vietnam has a long way to go toward opening up or 
liberalizing its society. What seems most obvious is that the surest road to 
democratic reform there lies in the breaking down of the barriers to the 
exchange of culture and information, which will come as a natural result of 
commerce once things are normalized.

KEEPING KIDS' HEADS OFF COLLISION COURSE; ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD BICYCLIST SHOWS WHY 
IT'S COOL TO WEAR A HELMET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcia White's cracked bicycle helmet left her schoolmates at Isaac L. Sowers 
Middle School in Huntington Beach imagining in horror what might have been. 
They got plenty to think about when the sixth-grader returned to class wearing 
a smile the day after she collided with a car as she bicycled home from school. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Her helmet shattered the windshield and then broke on impact with the 
pavement. The 11-year-old was wearing the headgear in compliance with the state 
law, effective Jan. 1, that requires minors to wear state-approved helmets 
while cycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia was one of the first in the state to realize the practical wisdom of 
the new law. And like hundreds of other students at Sowers, she was obeying a 
school district policy that went into effect at the same time.  
</P>
<P>
 This is one youngster whose own good sense was supported actively by parents 
and school authorities. That's the kind of cooperation it takes to win over 
those children who think "it's not cool" to wear a helmet. Moreover, the 
penalties for violating the new law aren't likely to be much of an incentive, 
nor are busy police likely to enforce it heavily. In the first year, only 
warnings will be issued; warnings are to be followed in 1995 by fines of up to 
$25. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the most persuasive case for the new law is made through experiences 
like Marcia's. There no doubt are still many stragglers around Southern 
California, like the dozen or so of Marcia's schoolmates who have been scolded 
by the principal for not wearing helmets. If these students were not persuaded 
by the new law -- and their parents have not already been convinced by 
statistics showing bicycle-related accidents to be the No. 1 cause of death and 
brain injury among children between 5 and 14 -- then the sight of a healthy 
Marcia White returning to ride another day should be an inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature should hold hearings later this year to assess the effects of 
the requirement and whether the helmet standards, as they now stand, are 
adequate or require further toughening.

CAREFUL, HE'S NOT MR. NICE GUY; SURE, SHAKE ASSAD'S HAND, BUT DON'T GO MUCH 
BEYOND THAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few hours from now, President Clinton is scheduled to shake hands in Geneva 
with President Hafez Assad of Syria, a gesture of high-level recognition -- if 
not of approbation -- that Washington hopes will help induce one of the Arab 
world's more durable and ruthless dictators to resume peace negotiations with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Syria-Israel talks, which have been held sporadically along with other 
bilateral negotiations as part of the U.S.-sponsored Middle East peace process, 
were suspended last fall. Syria has said there's nothing more to talk about 
until Israel first commits itself to withdraw from the Golan Heights, the 
strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel that Israeli troops occupied in 
the 1967 war. Israel says discussion of its withdrawal will go on the table as 
soon as Syria spells out what kind of a peace agreement it is ready to make. 
Such incompatible conditions inevitably have led to deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 HAPPY AS A SPOILER: It would of course be desirable to re-enlist Syria as a 
fully involved partner in the peace process, alongside Jordan and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. (Lebanon, the fourth Arab party in the talks, remains 
under partial occupation by the Syrian army, and is compelled to do what 
Damascus wants in this regard.) 
</P>
<P>
 If Syria commits to ending its long war with Israel the prospects for lasting 
accommodation in the eastern Mediterranean -- including, probably, an explosion 
in economic growth -- would be far brighter. If it stays outside the peace 
process, Syria almost certainly would continue to play its familiar role of 
spoiler, supporting the radical Iran-inspired Islamic group Hezbollah in 
southern Lebanon and doing what it could generally to subvert whatever progress 
Jordan and the Palestinians might make with Israel. If nothing else, Assad 
would be able to claim that he continues to stand at the head of those Arabs 
who reject all political and territorial compromises with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad might well indicate to Clinton that he could be drawn back into the 
peace process if the price was right. One thing he very much wants is for the 
State Department to drop Syria from its list of countries that support 
international terrorism. That would be a mistake. Syria has richly earned a 
place on the list by its deeds. It should be erased from the list not for 
expedient political reasons but only when it has clearly shown that it no 
longer supports terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 CREDITOR'S CALL: The fact is that Syria is not playing with a very strong hand 
when it comes to setting terms for rejoining the peace process. The 
considerable economic, military and political support Assad could once count on 
from the Soviet Union has disappeared. Indeed, Russia now wants the 
hard-pressed Damascus regime to repay its $8-billion debt to Moscow, and 
reportedly is holding up shipments of military spare parts until it starts to 
do so. Syria needs good relations and closer economic ties with the West. Even 
more important for the long term, it would benefit, along with others in the 
region, from the economic dividend that a successful peace process surely would 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching an accommodation with Israel and behaving responsibly after that are 
not gifts to be bestowed, but something Syria should do in its own interests. 
Not least, it could help promote Assad's ambition to restore Damascus as the 
hub of Arab cultural and political affairs. The self-interest argument is one 
Clinton should emphasize. What he should not do is hand Assad any unearned 
rewards to try to lure him back to the conference table. He should not get 
involved, either, in any substantive negotiations over either the terms for his 
return or -- more dangerously -- the terms of an Israel-Syria agreement. The 
strongest message Clinton can deliver is that peace will bring its own rewards. 
But peace can come about only through negotiations.

BIRTHS TO 59-YEAR-OLD

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is amusing to note that with all the hue and cry about the 59-year-old 
woman giving birth to twins (Dec. 28), resulting in calls to limit the use of 
"enhanced fertility technology" to women of appropriate childbearing age, no 
one has thought to, in parallel, require vasectomies on all men over the same 
appropriate childbearing age.

REBELLION IN MEXICO AND NAFTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The rebels in Chiapas followed their own timetable (Jan. 4). Such a 
large-scale operation obviously required long-range planning. The fact that it 
coincided with the implementation of NAFTA may or may not have been deliberate. 
But the relationship to NAFTA is evident. 
</P>
<P>
 NAFTA is one of several recent actions by the Mexican government which favor 
wealthy investors over Mexico's people. Another such action was the abolishment 
of the ejido system of land tenure, which had previously protected small 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 The elite of the world ignore the rights of the poor until the poor force them 
to pay attention. Indigenous people of Chiapas reacted to policies of which 
NAFTA is a part. 
</P>
<P>
 What NAFTA is to Mexico, GATT is to the world. Indigenous and poor people 
everywhere have much to fear from this so-called free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 PATRICK BONNER 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * The violent uprising in Mexico indicates not everyone is completely sold on 
free trade and capitalism. Since the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, 
capitalism has become synonymous with freedom and human rights. But history has 
shown that capitalism also can breed economic slavery and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweatshops of the early 1900s are a good example of the underside of 
capitalism. A few men became wealthy while others, including children, were 
exploited and made to work long hours just to survive. These abuses spawned 
unions to protect workers and laws like the minimum wage to even the playing 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 While NAFTA may be economically good for Mexico, it will surely destroy the 
country's way of life. I enjoy Mexico for its slow pace and uniqueness, not its 
beaches or accommodations. It would be a shame to see Mexico sell its soul for 
a few more pesos. 
</P>
<P>
 CLEM DOMINGUEZ 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach 
</P>
<P>
 * Your articles concerning the uprising in Chiapas miss the most obvious 
(unmentioned) fact: These peasants are rebelling against Mexico because it is a 
brutal despotism which practices institutionalized torture and death 
squad-style executions. Any union organizer or an opposition journalist is 
likely to be found face down in a ditch outside Mexico City, his (or her) body 
covered with bruises, cuts, or missing appendages, courtesy of the 
American-trained paramilitary counterinsurgency squads (which would explain any 
puzzling request of the rebels for the U.S. to stop training Mexican "police"). 
Until the government corresponds to internationally accepted norms of conduct 
and the corporate-owned PRI is replaced with a liberal democracy, there can be 
no end to the bloodshed.

NURSE ANESTHETISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As president of the American Assn. of Nurse Anesthetists, and educator in 
the Kaiser Permanente system here in Los Angeles, I felt it important to set 
the record straight after reading the Dec. 17 letter of Dr. Marie Kuffner's 
(immediate past president of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn.) on the role 
of nurse practitioners, with special focus on certified registered nurse 
anesthetists (CRNAs). It is notable that Dr. Kuffner, although addressing nurse 
anesthetists, neglected to mention her own specialty -- she is a practicing 
anesthesiologist.  
</P>
<P>
 CRNAs are most definitely sole providers in 85% of rural hospitals in the 
United States (whereby they serve 60 million Americans -- a population mix 
three times the size of Canada.) These practitioners enable the rural medical 
facilities to provide obstetrics, essential surgical, emergency and trauma 
stabilization services. As professional registered nurses, CRNAs are 
independently licensed to practice nursing within the scope of nurse practice 
acts and other regulations in each of the 50 states. Some licensing laws 
require the CRNA to work under the "supervision" of or in "collaboration with" 
a physician, such as a surgeon, dentist, or podiatrist. (In the state of 
California, no such "supervision" clause is utilized in the statute.) However, 
as far as anesthesia is concerned, as CRNAs we are legally responsible for our 
own decisions and services. 
</P>
<P>
 CRNAs administer anesthesia for all types of surgical cases. Based upon a 1988 
study by the Center for Health Economics Research, nurse anesthetists were 
regularly involved in the same kinds of anesthesia procedures -- from the most 
simple to the most complex -- as were anesthesiologists. Furthermore, multiple 
studies have not demonstrated any significant difference in quality of care 
between nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologists. 
</P>
<P>
 And, what about education? The most substantial difference between CRNAs and 
anesthesiologists is that prior to anesthesia education, anesthesiologists 
receive medical education while CRNAs receive nursing education. However, the 
anesthesia part of the education is very similar for both providers. Nurse 
anesthesia education programs involve 24-36 months of graduate work, including 
both classroom and clinical experiences. The classroom curriculum emphasizes 
the following in relation to anesthesia: anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, 
biochemistry, chemistry, physics and a minimum of 90 hours of pharmacology. The 
primary clinical component provides experience with a variety of anesthesia 
techniques and procedures for all types of surgery and obstetrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, to hold the credential of CRNA, the graduate must pass a 
national certification examination, and thereafter, meet specific continuing 
education requirements biennially for the rest of his or her professional life.

BALLOT INITIATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * This is one citizen who was less than saddened to learn that it will be a 
bad year for ballot initiatives (Jan. 5). 
</P>
<P>
 While noble in intention, this lawmaking process is a disaster. To expect the 
average voter to read, research and understand the volumes of information 
required to make intelligent decisions is unrealistic. Prop. 103, for example, 
was an absurd, simplistic approach to rising insurance costs.  
</P>
<P>
 The death of potentially harmful initiatives such as pay-at-the-pump should be 
a cause for celebration.

O.C. THEATER REVIEW; TEACHERS HELP 'LOUNGE' EARN 'A'; A SHARPLY DEFINED CAST, 
SUPERB DIRECTION AND DETAILED SET RAISE JOHN TWOMEY'S DEBUT COMEDY BEYOND 
STEREOTYPED VIGNETTES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN HERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 His gallows humor about teachers on the brink of disaster has TV sitcom 
written all over it. And his best one-liners have the cute sound of Neil Simon 
Lite. But count John Twomey a success anyway in his first outing as a 
playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Playhouse premiere of "Teachers' Lounge," Twomey's amusing take on 
the apparently unredeemable New York City school system, was a crowd-pleaser 
that drew peals of laughter Thursday night from a lively, nearly full house at 
the Moulton Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 Surely all this play means to do is entertain, notwithstanding a slight bow to 
substance and a pat ending to prick the conscience. Contrary to pre-opening 
publicity, "Teachers' Lounge" does not raise "serious questions." It has no 
satirical bite. Nor does it send a message, unless it's the one we get from the 
New York Post, in which the play's chief cynic -- Marty Goldberg, a teacher 
suffering from third-degree burnout -- has his nose buried at the top of the 
first act. 
</P>
<P>
 The boldfaced headline on the Post's front page -- IT HURTS SO BAD! -- more or 
less sums up the tone and spirit of Twomey's comic theme. Or, as another 
veteran teacher -- Nora O'Reilly, a tall blond earth goddess still fighting off 
burnout -- rephrases the headline for us: "Schools Reopen; Thugs Off Streets." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What "Teachers' Lounge" has in spades is not only a set design that recreates 
the drab environment of a New York high school down to the last detail but a 
sharply defined handful of teachers, all verging on caricatures nicely played 
and superbly directed, and a series of vignettes that takes us through a 
semester's slice of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Marty and Nora, we meet Sal Vincent, the smooth wiseguy; Susan Wagner, 
the ambitious brown-nose; Felix White, the prissy mama's boy; Stan Cohen, the 
imminent retiree, and Wallace Johnson, the new kid on the block. They kvetch, 
mostly with cynical frustration, about everything from their illiterate 
students and a beleaguered educational system to their unhappy private lives. 
</P>
<P>
 If all their complaints have been heard before -- and "Teachers' Lounge" seems 
like nothing so much as "Barney Miller" transferred to the local high school -- 
the production itself lends the script a freshness that transcends stereotype. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the playhouse has set something of a new standard for itself with 
this effort. It has created an original piece of work admirably suited to its 
audience, while avoiding the pitfall of artistic overreaching that plagued 
"Manet" four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Twomey, 31, has experienced "Teachers' Lounge" in his life. He is a 
New York City high school teacher. But writing from experience is no guarantee 
of success, and the playhouse took a big chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudos to all, not least to playhouse artistic director Andrew Barnicle, who 
plucked the script from a pile that came over the transom, staged it and helped 
Twomey shape it (a third of the dialogue is said to have been rewritten during 
rehearsals). 
</P>
<P>
 This is a comedy that has earned its applause.

TV REVIEW; DIANA ROSS IN 'DARKNESS' SPOTLIGHT; HER IMPRESSIVE ACTING IN ABC'S 
'OUT OF DARKNESS' ON SUNDAY IS A SHATTERING PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN BESET BY 
'VOICES AND DEMONS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diana Ross, essentially forgotten as an actress, has re-emerged after a 
shockingly long, self-imposed 16-year absence from the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a considerable return it is. "Out of Darkness" (at 9 p.m. Sunday on 
ABC, Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42) is Ross' shattering portrait of a woman's battle 
with paranoia/schizophrenia, experienced even in her better moments as "voices 
and demons." 
</P>
<P>
 The pop diva image is nowhere to be seen. Instead Ross galvanizes essentially 
every scene in a performance so impressively controlled and cliche-free that 
Ross must rank as Hollywood's best-kept acting secret. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems her acting debut 22 years ago in "Lady Sings the Blues," for which 
she deserved but lost the Oscar to Liza Minnelli (for "Cabaret"), was no fluke 
after all. But after her steep nose dive with "Mahogany" (1975) and a so-so 
attempt to reignite her screen career with "The Wiz" (1978), Ross dropped out 
of the acting business like a falling comet. 
</P>
<P>
 True, special scripts were hard to come by and Ross did recently get "scooped" 
(her own description) trying to lift a Josephine Baker project off the ground, 
but 16 years? 
</P>
<P>
 Out of darkness, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Ross, in her dramatic TV debut, has reinvented herself in a 
performance certain to recharge her acting career. And as co-executive 
producer, she helped flap together a distinguished production, beginning with 
the richly observant, well-researched screenplay by Barbara Turner and the 
expressive direction of Larry Elikann. 
</P>
<P>
 As Norma Desmond might say, Ross does bring a face to the screen. But only 
slowly do the feverish eyes and hard edges melt away following the last-ditch 
recourse of a psychiatrist (Lindsey Crouse) to free her with an experimental 
drug called clozapine. 
</P>
<P>
 When we meet Ross' deteriorating Paulie Cooper, she's in mad repose, staring 
through her bedroom window. She's 42, a onetime promising medical student and 
flower of everyone's eye whose life stopped at 25 and who's been in and out of 
mental hospitals for 17 years. We never sense the real source of Paulie's 
illness, except once when she self-mockingly describes herself as "my father's 
son," a curdling line. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera glides over Paulie's physical world, a wonderful old California 
Craftsman-style house on a peaceful block in L.A. and a protective, loving, 
expanded family that is helpless and even caged in its love: Paulie's vigorous 
mother (Ann Weldon), her endearing grandmother (Beah Richards), her wary, 
bright 10-year-old daughter (Chasiti Hampton) and her simmering sibling rival 
of a sister (Rhonda Stubbins White). 
</P>
<P>
 In "Out of Darkness," glamour takes a big holiday. But Ross doesn't need a 
stylish performance number to lean back on -- unlike her previous three movies 
and Ross' future ABC movie about the true-life Nazi concentration camp ordeal 
of little-known American jazz singer Valaida Snow (which was recently produced 
as a play in Studio City). 
</P>
<P>
 For the first half of the movie, Ross' stringy hair, puffy eyes and 
alternately glazed and fierce demeanor create evocative imprints. The dialogue 
is frequently jolting. "I'm a slut and I'm rotting inside," Paulie tells her 
mother. Later she tells a shrink that "my brain's been stolen, and it's going 
to the master machine that collects all brains." Later comes a sudden, blunt 
self-portrait: "I'm black and I'm getting blacker in here" (a psychiatric 
center). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Caroming between stays at home and psychiatric live-in centers (where team 
therapy sessions catch some of the flavor of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's 
Nest"), Ross rips apart a bathroom shower, sheds her clothes and cowers naked 
in the rain in a public street, and, subtle cruelty cracking the corners of her 
mouth, pours poison into her sister's soda pop. 
</P>
<P>
 As fear rules the deceptive warmth inside the house, her mom, the 
larger-than-life Weldon, bars her bedroom door at night and remarks of her 
daughter: "She has a terminal illness but never dies." 
</P>
<P>
 The material, which could have been so bloody predictable, is kept surging by 
not only Ross and a fine cast (especially check out Juanita Jennings' vibrant 
health specialist) but also by the movie's episodic blackouts, which enhance 
the action and the rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Paulie's return to health is sobering. Emblematic is a failed 
romantic encounter with an eligible bachelor too good to be true (Carl Lumbly) 
and a quietly numbing fade-out -- the perfect way to end this story.

MOVIE REVIEW; A GOOD PREMISE GETS LOST IN 'WEEKEND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The budget for Gregory Neri's "A Weekend With Barbara Und Ingrid" is so micro 
-- $59,313, according to the press kit -- that knocking it makes one feel like 
a clomping Godzilla. But despite an intriguing premise, this maundering malaise 
of a comedy is a chore to sit through (clomp).The pacing is slack (clomp, 
clomp), the acting doodly ( clomp ) and -- well, why go on?  
</P>
<P>
 It's about a failed L.A. poet (Jim Metzler) who writes bird cage manuals and 
whose girlfriend walks out on him just in time for Labor Day weekend. He wants 
to wall himself in with his misery but he's visited by two German performance 
artists, Barbara (Anna Katarina) und Ingrid (Michelle Holmes), who claim they 
hooked up with his former flame overseas. They camp out in his pad and before 
long we're inundated with life lessons and free-spirited falderal. (It plays 
Saturday and Sunday matinees at the Laemmle Sunset 5.) Metzler, who was 
excellent in "One False Move" a few years back, tries to excavate the comedy 
from his role and, in a bit part as a Jerry Lewis-like telethon host -- he's 
called Jerzy Louis here -- performance artist John Fleck has some tart moments 
of (very) low comedy.

THEATER REVIEW; 'FUNNY GAY MALES' LACKS TOGETHERNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Truth in advertising is alive and well at Highways. "Funny Gay Males," the 
latest comedy act to occupy the Santa Monica alternative theater's stage, 
delivers as promised. The New York-based trio is funny, gay and male. But 
what's implied in the title -- collective creation by an ensemble operating for 
a common cause -- never materializes. 
</P>
<P>
 These three guys claim to have been on the road together for five years. But 
they're not on stage as a troupe more than five minutes. The evening is divided 
into thirds. Each comic performs a solo turn showcasing his talent. We could be 
in any comedy club, witnessing more stand-up shtick. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny McWilliams has an impish size and elastic face. He describes a childhood 
in Queens, N.Y., as an Irish Catholic homosexual avoiding grim nuns. He 
brilliantly impersonates heavy-set, elderly women, but his cliched sketches on 
the "Wizard of Oz" belong in a comedy museum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Smith is tall, austere and literary. He outlines a childhood in Buffalo, 
N.Y., as "a gay kid who wasn't afraid of the dark, but was afraid of 
unflattering light." An inspired ploy occurs when Smith reads from actual 
grade-school report cards. The teacher's comments suggest that even in 
elementary school, Smith's sexual orientation was obvious. But his family 
denied it, and a gay comic was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe Cohen's Jewish Angst humor provides slight variations on familiar 
themes. Being gay has little to do with his modest jokes. But his routine about 
high school gym class is hysterical. (Remember "dodge ball"?) Otherwise, 
Cohen's sketches, like those of McWilliams and Smith, prove rather soft-focus 
and PG, lacking political comment or psychological insights. 
</P>
<P>
 After their 30-minute stand-up routines, the three briefly reunite to thank 
the audience, then gather at the exit, shaking hands as if it's a gay wedding 
party. Maybe that last gesture should become part of their act. At least then 
they're working the room together. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Funny Gay Males," Highways, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica. Tonight at 8:30, 
Sunday, 7:30 p.m. Ends Sunday. $10. (213) 660-8587. Running time: 1 hour, 30 
minutes.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; WILLIAMS BROTHERS SINCERE BUT LIMITED AT TROUBADOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Don't Look Now," the Williams Brothers' AIDS lament, typifies the duo's chief 
strength and major weakness. Their performance of the song at the Troubadour on 
Thursday was intensely earnest, but its message is stated so obviously and 
blandly that it registers only lightly on the emotional scale. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, Andrew and David Williams have become fixtures on 
L.A.'s bohemian folk-pop scene, and at the Troubadour you could see how their 
sincere, coffeehouse-casual manner and attractive sound would draw a following. 
Their limitations were equally evident. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in an austere, downbeat folk mode and building to a full, amplified 
folk sound, the 30ish twins framed their wistful romanticism, their 
psychotherapy-style childhood recollections and their pleas for tolerance in 
society in well-crafted settings that occasionally created a rich, evocative 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
 They ultimately added accordion and mandolin (by frequent playing and writing 
partner Marvin Etzioni) to their drums and cello support, but, despite these 
instrumental resources, their music was surprisingly monochromatic, and the 
brothers' smooth harmonies lacked the kind of bite that creates character and 
delivers complex emotions. They seem to come by their earnestness honestly 
enough, but they simply don't appear equipped to test deep waters. RICHARD

TUNE IN LOCAL TV NEWS TO CATCH THE JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for your informative interview with John Beard ("At Channel 11 News, 
'It Just Feels Better,' " Jan. 8). We concur absolutely with Beard regarding 
KNBC-TV local news coverage -- frankly, it's a joke. KNBC, along with KCBS and 
KABC, delivers news that insults every viewer's intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 We could care less about the Michael Jackson situation until all the facts are 
in. (Thanks anyway, KNBC!) 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas KABC previously led the pack in sensationalizing the news, KNBC has 
now taken over that ranking. If blood, gore, porn and trivia are the only 
platforms on which our newscasts choose to compete, then we should all just 
face up to the fact that local news has become one of the worst daily soap 
operas -- something along the lines of "As the Stomach Churns."

 As a board member of Big Brothers of Los Angeles, I met with Beard and 
then-General Manager John Rohrbeck about the problem we were having recruiting 
enough qualified men as Big Brothers to the hundreds of needy boys on our 
waiting lists. The result of that meeting more than four years ago was a series 
of news inserts, "Friday's Pal," which the station produced and telecast weekly 
until Beard left for KTTV. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friday's Pal" was the best recruitment campaign Big Brothers ever had. It 
succeeded solely because Beard gave of his time and himself so generously.

<P>
 In the last year, the management at KNBC has made judgment calls that have 
deprived us of valuable reporters and reporting on consumerism, education and 
the environment, and now we're losing the guidance we used to get about movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Hoffman, KNBC-TV's news boss, seems to be responsible. Not only has he 
driven away top KNBC anchors (Beard and Linda Alvarez) but word is that his 
decisions are causing movie critic David Sheehan to want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC should at least try to salvage some of the well-liked, established local 
talent that Hoffman is driving away.

 REALLY EXCITED BY MANILOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Paul Grein's review "Could It Be Magic? Yes, If You're Barry 
Manilow" (Dec. 29), as I was the woman who was called up to the stage to sing 
"Can't Smile Without You" with Manilow, I feel compelled to respond to Grein's 
quotation of mine: 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, my answer to the question, "Do you know the words?" to "Can't Smile" was, 
indeed, "I did !" However, that was because I was excited and in total shock to 
be on stage with this talented, inspirational superstar Barry Manilow. I feared 
the words I knew so well might fly right out of my head; not that the song was 
so old I couldn't remember it, as Grein implied. 
</P>
<P>
 As a fan of Manilow, I would never insult or embarrass him. When he and I were 
singing together, he asked the audience to join in -- and they did, and that 
only proves that everyone knows the words to "Can't Smile."

WELLES' 'SHADOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan King's article about the forthcoming film version of the old radio 
serial "The Shadow" states that "Orson Welles was the seductive voice of the 
super-hero on the famed '40s radio series" ("Putting the Shadow in His Place," 
Jan. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Welles was the radio voice of the Shadow in 1937 and 1938 and might have 
continued in that capacity if he hadn't done the 1938 "War of the Worlds" 
broadcast.He suddenly became too well known, and the powers-that-be at the 
network decided he could not continue as the Shadow.

<P>
 "The Shadow" debuted Aug. 1, 1930, and ran until Dec. 26, 1954. It was 
re-syndicated in the '60s and '70s and still can occasionally be heard on local 
radio.

ARMED FOR SELF-DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Had Polly Klaas grabbed a gun and shot her assailant dead, would Calendar have 
condemned her for not "sensibly hiding in her room," from where she would have 
otherwise been abducted by but one "unarmed burglar" who grabbed a kitchen 
knife? (" 'Armed' With a Message," Jan. 4). Would your writer take a 
sympathetic account of that much-happier story as his cue to blast her family 
as "gun-obsessed," "macho," "shallow" and "thick-headed"? Is Polly Klaas better 
dead than "warped"? 
</P>
<P>
 The consequences of exercising one's right to self-defense are, as evidenced 
by the CBS drama "Armed and Innocent," severe enough without the pious judgment 
of television critics. Call them "the psychological price of keeping guns in 
the home" if you must, but recognize the source: criminals who leave their 
victims no choice but self-defense. And note it's a price that might be 
"sensibly" preferred by those who won't be made to hide in their own homes, 
reward any felon who successfully breaks in with the right to decide their fate 
and ultimately pay the non-psychological but nevertheless real price of being 
dead.

TV REVIEWS; 'CARLIN' SHOWS SOME GLIMMER OF HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Carlin waited all these years to star in a sitcom, and he still doesn't 
get to blurt the "Seven Words You Can't Say on Television." No, not even on 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 He does get to be a couple of those words, however, on "The George Carlin 
Show" (premiering Sunday at 9:30 p.m. on Channels 11 and 6), where he's utterly 
irascible, to use the civil terminology. His George O'Grady, an unencumbered 
New York cab driver, is broke, bitchy and practically invented the word 
misanthropy.  
</P>
<P>
 He has good reason to be cranky in the first episode -- having just lost his 
job because he won't cut his ponytail, having lost thousands of dollars he 
doesn't have to gambling debts, and having found a tiny dog that makes everyone 
who sees him walking it assume he's gay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hope sucks," he tells the downtrodden waitress at his favorite beer bar, 
encouragingly. "People who have hope, they're constantly worried about when 
it's gonna kick in. They don't get to have a good time. On the other hand, a 
guy gives up hope, he's free to enjoy himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Will folks who tune in enjoy themselves? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there's hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was created by Sam Simon, who directed and co-wrote (with Carlin) the 
series opener, so it shouldn't come as any surprise when a fair amount of 
zingers approach home plate. Besides Carlin being a cab driver, recalling 
Simon's "Taxi" stint, he spends a lot of his down time as the cynical anchor of 
a working-class tavern populated by a dim bartender, a busty waitress, errant 
yuppies and a lot of other foils, not coincidentally bringing to mind "Cheers," 
another Simon alma mater. He knows his way around these comedic habitats, and 
the dialogue is properly tart. 
</P>
<P>
 If not quite properly heartfelt. Carlin makes for a very viable, potentially 
lovable loser, but he and Simon will need to flesh out a back story to 
rationalize the character's sourness if they're interested in establishing the 
distinction between curmudgeon and jerk, which is blurry in the premiere. CHRIS 
WILLMAN

TV REVIEWS; 'STELLAR AWARDS' SPOTLIGHT ON GOSPEL SINGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now may be a more appropriate time than ever for mainstream music fans to tune 
in to that annual celebration of gospel, "The Stellar Awards" (at 11 p.m. 
Sunday on KCAL-TV Channel 9). Not because black gospel has been making inroads 
commercially, but because R&B as a genre has so been tipping its hat to its 
roots lately -- and, conversely, gospel growing so contemporized -- that a lot 
of this stuff won't sound all that foreign to anyone who skips church to listen 
to hit radio. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-hour telecast is a first-class affair that, for the moment, makes you 
forget the commercial ghettoization of gospel. The presenters -- more than a 
dozen African American TV series regulars -- may be better known to most 
viewers than the nominees themselves, but the performances offer a quick, 
appealing primer. (And unlike most other opportunities to experience live 
gospel, there's the safety of a definite ending time.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not all the genre's aficionados will appreciate the fairly glitzy trappings in 
this special (taped at Chicago's Auditorium Theater in November, but scheduled 
for airing in conjunction with Martin Luther King Day celebrations). And the 
extremity of co-host Clifton Davis' cheerful enunciation cuts the grit factor 
in half all by itself.  
</P>
<P>
 But the grins and gowns are a small price to pay for a lineup that ranges from 
legend Albertina Walker to new-artist nominees, the Kurt Franklin Family 
Singers. 
</P>
<P>
 Highlights include perpetual gospel chart-toppers the Mississippi Mass Choir; 
Stephanie Mills fronting the crowd-pleasing Tri-City Singers; Ricky Dillard, 
the "Leap of Faith" film's choir director, with his New Generation Chorale; 
Mavis Staples, providing some welcome lower-register fireworks with a track 
from her recent Prince-produced album; and Company, a male sextet that, while 
not the hottest thing happening here, does effectively demonstrate the bridge 
between this body of work and all the gospel-influenced vocal groups out now 
like Boyz II Men. CHRIS WILLMAN

TV REVIEWS; DID U.S. CREATE TERROR MONSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The very title of Peter Arnett's CNN report -- "Terror Nation? U.S. Creation?" 
(at 6 p.m. Sunday) -- suggests the Frankenstein syndrome that seems to dog so 
many of the political monsters created during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, one person's monster is another person's freedom fighter: Arnett's 
particular monster here is militant Islamic leader and Afghanistan Prime 
Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who may be viewed as the loosest of loose 
cannons, arming and training terrorists for assaults on the West and Western 
allies.His Muslim brothers, though, posit him as a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this devotion, and the suicidal martyrdom that results from it, that 
makes Hekmatyar's alleged brand of terror so potentially dangerous. The first 
salvo in this war: the bombing of the World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnett, hardly a favorite of the U.S. defense Establishment since his 
spectacular Baghdad reports during the height of the Gulf War, will make no new 
friends with "Terror Nation?," which convincingly explains how the Trade Center 
bombers received their initial training, under CIA sponsorship, during the war 
to free Afghanistan of the invading Soviet army. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnett is remarkably free to explore Hekmatyar's network of Afghanistan 
terrorist training camps -- he even arranges a talk with Hekmatyar himself. 
</P>
<P>
 With cash derived from a resurgent drug trade through the Khyber Pass, and a 
huge U.S. and Soviet arms supply left behind by the war, Hekmatyar, Arnett 
reports, has been able to wage a two-pronged battle. First, he is embroiled in 
a civil war to oust Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani. Second, with his 
control of between 5,000 and 10,000 militants, Hekmatyar has been able to 
extend his fundamentalist jihad (or holy war) into India's Kashmir province, 
Egypt, Algeria and the Islamic-dominated southern provinces of the former 
Soviet Union. ROBERT KOEHLER

 MIDDLE GROUND: Irvine politics is often a struggle between conservative and 
liberal forces. These days conservatives control its City Council. But in an 
effort to go beyond partisanship, the council this week appointed Paula Werner 
as mayor pro tem. She's considered the last of the "Agranistas" -- a reference 
to liberal former Mayor Larry Agran, whose forces once were in control. Says 
Werner: "I hope this is the end of the divisiveness and the idea of 'us versus 
them.' "

 BREAKING SILENCE: "The Story of Truong Chi," based on a Vietnamese folk tale, 
will be part of Seattle Mime Theatre's presentation tonight at Fullerton's 
Plummer Auditorium (F2). The touring troupe often encounters children of 
Vietnamese immigrants "who come up and say they've heard a version of the story 
in their families," says troupe co-founder Bruce L. Wylie. Don't expect 
complete silence: The mime company breaks with tradition by adding spoken word 
to its interpretations.

 GENTLE FIGHTER: Bob Pusavat, county redevelopment director, is fighting gangs 
his own way. He's recently helped a group of 40 El Modena gang members organize 
a carwash, then used the money to take them to Big Bear. Around a campfire, the 
youths listened to former gangbangers decry that lifestyle. Says Pusavat: 
"There, up in the mountains with the trees, they could see things they can't 
see on the streets. They can see things around them, and inside themselves, 
too."

 A NO-SHOW: La Habra officials were beaming proudly this week at the outdoor 
party for their new community health clinic at Las Lomas Elementary School. But 
why did Kathleen Hurwitz, the clinic's doctor, skip the ceremonies? . . . 
Because she was inside the clinic, treating a 9-year-old girl for pneumonia. 
"Patient care never stops to party," Hurwitz said later. The new clinic, 
designed to help the low income or uninsured, expects to treat 3,500 children a 
year.

R. BRINKLEY SMITHERS; GAVE MILLIONS FOR ALCOHOLISM RESEARCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 R. Brinkley Smithers, 86, a recovering alcoholic who funneled more than $41 
million into alcoholism research. A native of New York's Long Island, Smithers 
was educated at Johns Hopkins University.He was the son of investment banker 
Christopher D. Smithers, who helped create Computing-Tabulating-Recording Co., 
which became IBM. The younger Smithers worked for IBM as a marketing executive, 
but quit after a few years, saying that work "interfered with his . . . 
drinking." He also served eight years as an Army officer before using his 
inheritance to create a foundation to combat alcoholism. He took his last drink 
in 1953, a year after his father's death. Among Smithers' largest gifts were 
$6.7 million to Cornell and Rutgers universities in 1986 for the R. Brinkley 
Smithers Institute for Alcoholism Prevention and Workplace Problems, and $10 
million to New York's Roosevelt Hospital in 1971 for the Smithers Alcoholism 
Treatment and Training Center. On Tuesday in New York.

S. BRONSTON; PRODUCER OF 'EL CID,' OTHER EPICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Samuel Bronston, producer of such grandiose films as "El Cid," "55 Days at 
Peking," "Fall of the Roman Empire" and similar epics, has died at his son's 
home in Sacramento, it was reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronston was 85 and had moved from his home in Houston when his health began 
to fail. The Russian-born, Sorbonne-educated photographer and film executive 
died Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bronston served for years as official photographer to the Vatican, producing 
in the 1940s a series of films for the Roman Catholic Church. He began in film 
sales with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer in France. He formed an independent production 
company and came to the United States in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 His early films included "Jack London" with Susan Hayward in 1943, "And Then 
There Were None" in 1945 and "Walk in the Sun," another 1945 movie that focused 
on the exploits of an Army patrol during the Italian campaign of World War II. 
Today it is considered among the most pristine of the anti-war pictures. 
</P>
<P>
 He also made "Ten Little Indians" and "City Without Men" in the 1940s. 
</P>
<P>
 Encouraged by his successes, he moved his operations to Madrid in the early 
1950s, where he was credited with establishing Spain as an international film 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 There he produced "John Paul Jones," with Robert Stack and Bette Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the apex of his commercial film career came in 1961 with the release 
of "El Cid," the recently re-released tale of the legendary 11th-Century 
adventurer who drove the Moors from Spain. 
</P>
<P>
 It starred Charlton Heston and Sophia Loren, and Heston has said the 
high-budget epic is among his favorites. 
</P>
<P>
 "El Cid" brought Bronston awards at the Charleston International Film Festival 
and the Golden Glove Hollywood Press Assn. award. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his last films was "Circus World" with John Wayne and Rita Hayworth, 
which won the 1964 Gran Prix Exceptionnel award in Brussels. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his former wife, Dorothea, six children, 10 grandchildren 
and a brother and two sisters. 
</P>
<P>
 Memorial services are pending.

JAMES ELLISON; BUFFALO BILL IN 'THE PLAINSMAN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James Ellison, who played major roles in 82 films, including Buffalo Bill in 
Gary Cooper's "The Plainsman," has died. He was 83. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison, who switched from acting to real estate and contracting in the 1950s, 
died Dec. 23 after breaking his neck in a fall near his Montecito home. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born James Ellison Smith on May 4, 1910, in Guthrie Center, Iowa. His 
father, an English-born rancher, and his mother, a writer, moved with him to 
Los Angeles when he was a youngster. He attended Hollywood High School and was 
graduated from Polytechnic High School, where he was student body president. 
</P>
<P>
 He studied acting at the Pasadena Community Theater and the Moscow Art Theater 
in Hollywood, and made his screen debut in the 1932 film "Play Girl" with 
Loretta Young. 
</P>
<P>
 The handsome, outdoors-loving Ellison soon found a niche in Westerns -- 
notably as William Boyd's sidekick Johnny Nelson in eight "Hopalong Cassidy" 
films. 
</P>
<P>
 Cecil B. De Mille liked his "Hoppy" work and cast him with Cooper in the 
legendary 1937 Western "The Plainsman." Ellison always felt he was miscast as 
Buffalo Bill, and neither he nor De Mille was happy with his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 That film won him grander roles, however, in non-Westerns such as "Vivacious 
Lady" with Ginger Rogers in 1938, which revealed his unrealized talent for 
light comedy. He went on to "Next Time I Marry" with Lucille Ball and "Mother 
Carey's Chickens" with Ruby Keeler, both in 1938, and "Hotel for Women" in 1939 
with Linda Darnell. His last film was "The Man From Black Hills" in 1952. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no illusions about my abilities on the screen," Ellison said in his 
later years, despite his considerable credits. "The best review I ever got was 
when a woman came over to me in a bank and asked if I was James Ellison. I 
thought she was a fan. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out she just wanted to tell me how much she and her family were 
enjoying the home I'd built a number of years before. I was delighted. I think 
I'll be remembered more for Ellison Drive, which I developed in Beverly Hills, 
than for any of my pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellison's first wife, Gertrude Durkin, died in 1970 after 33 years of 
marriage. He is survived by his second wife, former ballerina Shelly Keats, a 
son, two stepdaughters and five grandchildren.

OFFICIAL ADMITS ERROR IN ALLOWING SHERIFF'S CAPTAIN TO RECEIVE DOUBLE PAY; 
FINANCE: L.A. COUNTY WILL NOT SEEK RECOVERY OF $70,000 IMPROPERLY PAID FOR HIS 
EXPERT TESTIMONY AT TRIALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH REICH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 1990 ordinance prohibiting Los Angeles County employees from receiving any 
pay beyond their regular salaries for testifying as expert witnesses in cases 
involving the county was violated over a 2 1/2-year period, but there is 
apparently nothing that can be done to collect the $70,000 illegally paid, 
officials say. 
</P>
<P>
 S. Robert Ambrose, the attorney in the county counsel's office who directed 
that the ordinance be drawn up, blames himself for not knowing what was in it 
and for unintentionally allowing the violation to occur. 
</P>
<P>
 But asked whether he will seek to recover the $70,000 paid to a sheriff's 
captain commanding the West Hollywood station for providing expert testimony 
and other assistance in 35 civil "excessive force" cases from early 1991 to 
late 1993, Ambrose responded: 
</P>
<P>
 "Heavens no. He earned it. He did, in fact, earn it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, representatives of the district attorney's office and the Sheriff's 
Department say they agree with Ambrose that nothing can be done about what he 
calls his "oversight." 
</P>
<P>
 It is "somewhat pointless" to go into the matter further, said Capt. Dan Burt, 
a spokesman for Sheriff Sherman Block, because "the ordinance in question 
appears to have no criminal sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Paul W. Turley, who conducted an inquiry into the matter, 
said: "A violation of one of these ordinances is not a crime. I don't know 
exactly what kind of personnel actions are available to the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Turley said it could have been a punishable offense under a provision of the 
California Penal Code if the sheriff's captain, Clarence R. Chapman, had 
received compensation for his expert testimony at the same time he was 
performing his duties. 
</P>
<P>
 In a formal conclusion to an inquiry regarding the state code, Turley wrote: 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence suggests that Capt. Chapman has engaged in a variation of 
double-dipping, getting paid twice by Los Angeles County for the same hours 
worked. While such a practice may offend elementary principles of propriety, it 
does not support the filing of a criminal action.  
</P>
<P>
 "In view of our factual and legal analysis of this matter, we will take no 
further action in this case and consider the case to be closed." 
</P>
<P>
 His report discussed only the double-dipping question and the penal code and 
did not mention the county ordinance. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, a 27-year veteran of the Sheriff's Department, said in interviews 
that he had not double-dipped, and he was supported in those assertions by 
Block. The sheriff said that station commanders are not held to any particular 
working hours because they are considered subject to be on duty at any time. 
</P>
<P>
 Block said he ordered a routine audit last fall of the county counsel's 
payments to the captain and had referred the matter to the district attorney 
for investigation to be sure nothing wrong had occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambrose said he had ordered a staff member to draw up the ordinance in 1990 
when he was told that Ronald Kornblum, who was county coroner at the time, was 
enhancing his income by testifying against the county, and his deputies, in a 
number of civil cases in which people were suing the county for damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Kornblum, now an independent pathologist, denies he did that. "I did have 
cases (where I testified) in other areas of the country," he said, but "I did 
not engage in anything within L.A. County." 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors approved the ordinance and it went into effect 
in late 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Ambrose said in an interview that he thought the ordinance merely prohibited 
testimony by county employees against the county for remuneration, not pay to 
those who testified for the county's position. 
</P>
<P>
 He began using Chapman because he was an excellent, compelling witness, and 
believes that the sheriff's captain was so convincing to juries that he saved 
the county a lot of money that it would have had to pay in judgments, Ambrose 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Ambrose was informed by the Sheriff's Department that the ordinance 
made Chapman's work for him illegal, he said, and he informed Chapman on Sept. 
28 that all such expert witnessing by him was being suspended. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman, who has formed his own company to pursue expert witnessing in and out 
of Los Angeles County, said he is considering retirement from the Sheriff's 
Department within the next several months and may decide to pursue the 
specialty on a full-time basis, unless he lines up another law enforcement 
position. 
</P>
<P>
 Two county supervisors, asked for comment on the apparently toothless 
ordinance, differed on what should be done now. 
</P>
<P>
 Board Chairwoman Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said: "If there's no way to enforce 
the ordinance, maybe we should put in sanctions." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ed Edelman said: "I think the ordinance needs to be rethought. Maybe, it 
should only prohibit paid testimony when it's against the county."

people came to see their friends off. 
</P>
<P>
 The saddest came Friday, however, when hundreds turned out to say goodby to 
the Pasadena train depot itself. 
</P>
<P>
 The picturesque station, famed as a backdrop for movies and as a favored 
departure point for Hollywood stars, was closed so its tracks can be converted 
for a future commuter rail line. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting today, the transcontinental Southwest Chief passenger train that 
stopped twice daily at the downtown Pasadena station will be rerouted through 
Orange County by its Amtrak operators. Start-up of the $847-million light-rail 
line is expected in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials hope to preserve the station itself -- perhaps as a museum or 
community center. But it will be boarded up until its fate is decided. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 400 people showed up before dawn Friday to watch the last westbound 
passenger train pull into the station. Some brought cameras. Others brought 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very sad day," Altadena resident Paula Aghajanian said as she sat 
on a curb next to the tracks with son Gregory, 5, and daughter Lauren, 3. 
Gregory was wearing a pint-size conductor's hat and talking of becoming a train 
engineer when he grows up. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Carlson, a Pasadena video distributor, was with 13-month-old Lindsay 
Johnston and her brother, Timothy, 3. "I was determined that my grandkids get 
to ride a train out of this station," Carlson said. "They may not remember it, 
but I will." 
</P>
<P>
 Near the rusty signal tower that once flagged down crews from trains with such 
proud names as the California Limited, El Capitan and the Grand Canyon Limited, 
Barbara Boekenoogen stood clutching a blowup of a photo of the station taken in 
1941 by her husband, Glenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Little seemed to have changed about the elegant little structure, built of 
stucco and concrete with a red tile roof and pastel-framed windows. It was 
constructed in 1935, the third depot building to serve the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the first Super Chief come through when I was a kid in the '30s," said 
Glenn Boekenoogen, a lithographer from Altadena. "I'll tell you, it was 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, Bob Finan surveyed the lights shining from inside the station for the 
last time. The morning gloom around him matched his own. 
</P>
<P>
 "I swapped shifts with someone at work and got up at a quarter to 4 to come," 
said Finan, 41, a high-rise building engineer from West Los Angeles. "This is a 
melancholy day." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, ticket agent Susie Brown was experiencing something rarely seen during 
her seven years there: People clamoring for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 She was pleased that the depot's waiting room -- with polished wooden benches 
and ornate Western-style chandeliers beneath a ceiling of hand-hewn open beams, 
was busy on its last day. 
</P>
<P>
 "The roof leaks. And sometimes I think there are ghosts in here," said Brown, 
who will be transferred to Amtrak's Fullerton depot. "But this is a lovely 
place." 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, the last train was late. Snowy weather encountered two days ago 
near its Chicago starting place was blamed. The crowd passed the time 
reminiscing. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1930s and '40s, celebrities such as Clark Gable, Mae West, Will Rogers, 
Gary Cooper and Jeannette MacDonald favored the Pasadena station over the 
larger Union Station in Los Angeles, remembered Ralph Melching of the Pasadena 
Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 About 320 passengers were already aboard when the train finally pulled into 
Pasadena moments before 8 a.m. There was room for only 75 more to ride the last 
10 miles to Downtown Los Angeles. And only one true traveler was among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Smith, 20, of Monterey Park was headed for Seattle. "I didn't expect so 
many people would come to see me off," he said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 The others, such as Barbara Sibert of Alhambra and Greg Gneier and Janine 
Duffy of Pasadena, were more subdued as they climbed aboard and took seats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to miss the trains' whistle," said Thelma Vickroy. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally came Susie Brown's voice over the station loudspeaker: "And now, for 
the final time, this is the final boarding call. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 To the toot of its horn and the cheers of its friends, the train pulled out.

PROPOSED SUPER-AGENCY WOULD COORDINATE ECONOMIC PLANNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES RAINEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to focus and improve Los Angeles' business promotion efforts, 
two top city administrators Friday released their plan to consolidate economic 
development operations from four departments into a new super-agency. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Economic Development Department could open as soon as April, 
if the City Council and Mayor Richard Riordan reaffirm their earlier conceptual 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 The new agency would take over many responsibilities now assumed by the 
Community Redevelopment Agency, Community Development Department, Board of 
Public Works and Mayor's Office. It would be headed by a commission that would 
plot a business growth strategy and consolidate loan programs now divided among 
three offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The reorganization plan -- designed by city administrative officer Keith 
Comrie and chief legislative analyst Ron Deaton -- could cut the city work 
force by 42 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the need for such a centralized operation was demonstrated by 
another event Friday at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council approved a plan to divide $60 million in federal loan funds 
between housing construction and rehabilitation and programs for economic 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 More telling than the decision, several officials said, was the fact that the 
economic development component of the program has still not been defined, 11 
months after the federal government agreed to loan the city the money. 
</P>
<P>
 Such inertia would be averted by the new Economic Development Department, 
which would function as a clearinghouse for all pro-business initiatives in the 
city, proponents said. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency would be run by a seven-member commission appointed by the mayor 
and confirmed by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 Backers said the consolidation would make it easier for business people and 
others to understand the city's economic development efforts and for the city 
to respond to changing conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is how we can be far more effective in articulating a vision for 
economic development and laying out a work plan to do it," said Councilman Mark 
Ridley-Thomas, who led the move to streamline the bureaucracy. "It's a 
recognition that what we have done to date has been inadequate." 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's separate action Friday on the $60-million federal loan fund 
should also begin to instigate economic activity, council members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal budget includes $2 billion for cities to borrow against future 
grants they will receive from the Department of Housing and Urban Development. 
Rep. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) had been instrumental in creating the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' $60-million share was approved in February for use throughout 
riot-torn neighborhoods. Since then, little has been done to spend the money, 
despite the region's continuing economic deprivation. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Housing Department stepped into the void, suggesting it could use 
as much as $40 million of the money to refurbish homes and to build new ones. 
The proposal was backed by Ridley-Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 But Waters was disturbed that money would be diverted from economic 
development, which she considers the area's greatest need. "They had not 
developed any economic development programs," Waters said. "It was very 
frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Waters and city officials agreed to split the money between the 
housing programs and economic development. Waters said she agreed to the 
compromise because the housing work is ready to proceed, while the business 
plans are languishing. 
</P>
<P>
 The housing funds will help rehabilitate about 1,630 houses and apartments and 
build 375 new homes. Housing Department general manager Gary Squier said the 
work will have economic benefits of its own, creating jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "This $30 million will enable the Housing Department to substantially turn 
around deteriorated pockets of the city,"' Squier said. "And that is essential 
at a time when the recession is destabilizing our rental housing stock." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Mayor Robin Kramer said Riordan's Administration is looking for ways to 
use the $30 million in economic development money. 
</P>
<P>
 The city does not have much time to dawdle. A specific plan must be submitted 
by Feb. 28 or HUD will cut off the funds.

FEDERAL OFFICIALS GET STREET-LEVEL VIEW ON VERMONT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY and PAUL FELDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Testifying before government officials is often a stuffy affair in a sterile 
conference room. But on Friday, Tony Love and other small business owners along 
Vermont Avenue were able to share their views without having to leave their 
shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming to the front doors of their struggling businesses were members of the 
House of Representatives, the Clinton Administration and the mayor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Love, who owns Sir Tony's Fashion, told the officials of his daily struggle to 
make a living and the difficulty he faces in getting loans. He said he has sold 
drugs, spent time in jail but had settled on a new enterprise -- 
entrepreneurship. 
</P>
<P>
 Questioning him from the sidewalk were two members of the House Banking 
Committee, Reps. Maxine Waters (D-Los Angeles) and Joseph Kennedy (D-Mass.), 
Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros and Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized by Waters, the tour was designed to examine the credit problems 
facing residents of the inner city as part of a review of the Community 
Reinvestment Act, which requires financial institutions to issue loans in their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan and Cisneros promised to assist in creating a commercial development 
plan for Vermont Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said he decided this week to appoint an aide to develop and 
implement an economic plan for Vermont. Cisneros said he will seek federal 
funds to help plan a commercial corridor along the struggling area of Vermont. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros said the funds might be funneled to Community Build, a South-Central 
Los Angeles community development organization that has received $3 million in 
HUD funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cisneros brought along good news on another front when he announced that the 
city and county of Los Angeles, and the neighboring cities of Glendale and Long 
Beach, would be the site of the country's second "Homeless Initiative" and 
would receive a significant increase in funding for the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Although no amount was specified, Washington, D.C., received $20 million over 
three years when it was selected last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials estimate that there are 80,000 homeless in Los Angeles County, which 
Cisneros called "one of the largest homeless populations in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which will drastically expand the $1 million that the city 
receives for emergency shelters, will focus on those who live in urban 
encampments, the mentally ill, homeless families and those who recently became 
homeless. The city and county recently combined their homeless initiatives in 
the new Los Angeles Services Authority. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is terrific news for Los Angeles," said Riordan, who applied for the 
funding last month. 
</P>
<P>
 At a neighborhood association meeting held at a community center a few blocks 
from Waters' home, she complained about the lack of adequate city planning in 
the neighborhood, citing a Payless shoe store -- one of the few chain stores to 
build in the neighborhood since the riots -- as an eyesore.

L.A. SCHOOLS TRUMP BUILDER ON HOTEL SITE; COURTS: RULING IS A DEFEAT FOR DONALD 
TRUMP, WHO FOUGHT TO MAKE THE DISTRICT STICK TO ITS PLAN TO BUY AMBASSADOR 
SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In a victory for the Los Angeles school district over developer Donald Trump, 
a court ruled Friday that the district is free to drop its bid to buy the 
historic Ambassador Hotel property, clearing the way for it to purchase another 
sorely needed high school site. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Barnet M. Cooperman threw out Trump-Wilshire 
Associates' lawsuit to force the school district to stick to its plans to buy 
the Ambassador from them. 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of elementary schoolchildren, the ruling means a new high school 
will be built closer to their homes in Downtown Los Angeles in four to five 
years, saving them from long bus rides to other campuses, district officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The protracted battle over ownership and value of one of the city's most 
widely known landmarks is likely to be the focus of more court battles, as 
Trump representatives fight to keep the school district's $48-million deposit 
for the land. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district has treated us terribly and has been extremely cavalier about 
this," said Trump spokeswoman Barbara Res. She said Trump's next step will be 
to sue the district for damages because it unfairly tied up the Wilshire 
corridor property. "We are going to end up with the lion's share of the $48 
million." 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the district decided to walk away from its pursuit of the 
Ambassador land, citing its tight finances and the dramatic decline in real 
estate values. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the district has negotiated with another developer to buy a 
24-acre plot near Temple and Beaudry avenues Downtown. The state's school 
construction board gave the district tentative approval to buy the new site 
with $30 million of the $50 million it had allocated to buy the Ambassador. The 
district forfeited the remaining $20 million in construction funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Trump attorneys argued that the district should not renege on its plans 
because it unfairly hurts Trump's financial standing with the site. They 
claimed that he lost development opportunities while paying $1 million a month 
in maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an abuse of power. . . . They don't want to buy it now because it is 
too expensive," charged William M. Bitting, who said the district's real plan 
is to buy the property for less money at a later date. 
</P>
<P>
 James W. Colbert, an O'Melveny & Myers attorney representing the district, 
argued that the contractual agreement with Trump allowed the district to drop 
the bid. He also contended that Trump has benefited from the interest-free use 
of the district's $48-million deposit on the land, which Trump used to help pay 
off the mortgage. Trump paid $64 million for the site in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooperman sided with the district, saying that Trump-Wilshire Associates had 
not proven that its financial position with the site has worsened. He said 
Trump has the right to seek damages through other court avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Friday ruling forces Trump to refund the district's deposit with interest 
within a year. However, litigation could stall or prevent the pay-back if a 
judge later rules that Trump has been hurt by the district's decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials put up district headquarters as collateral to obtain the 
$48-million loan for the deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990 the district has been fighting with Trump over the value of the 
Ambassador site. Trump set its worth at more than $110 million. The district 
offered $45 million. 
</P>
<P>
 When the parties failed to agree on the price, the district used its authority 
to take property through eminent domain proceedings, which give government 
entities the power to buy land from property owners for fair market value. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the early fight, school board members were adamant about the need 
to build a high school in the area, where about 3,000 Mid-Wilshire teen-agers 
are bused to Valley and Westside high schools because their neighborhood 
schools are overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 Both sides were headed for trial this fall to determine the cost. Under state 
laws, the jury would be required to set the Ambassador price at land values in 
1990, when eminent domain proceedings began. With today's depressed real estate 
market, the district would have faced the likelihood of paying an inflated 
price for the land.

PROSECUTORS WON'T ACT AND JUDGE WON'T BUDGE; COURTS: U.S. ATTORNEY'S OFFICE 
SAYS IT HAS NO CASE AGAINST A MAN WHO SAYS HE BROUGHT GUN INTO COURTHOUSE BY 
MISTAKE. BUT AN ANGRY JURIST HAS KEPT HIM IN JAIL SINCE OCT. 4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Even though prosecutors decided a month ago they have no case against him, a 
63-year-old man who carried a loaded .357 magnum into a Los Angeles federal 
courthouse remains jailed because an angry judge is refusing on principle to 
dismiss the charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Vladimir Flint was arrested Oct. 4 after federal marshals seized the gun he 
was carrying in a portfolio as he passed through a metal detector at a Downtown 
courthouse. In mid-October, he was ordered held without bail as a flight risk 
and a trial date was set. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Dec. 13, one day before Flint was to go on trial, Assistant U.S. Atty. 
Alicia Amador told U.S. District Judge David W. Williams that the charge should 
be dismissed because the government had less of a case than it originally 
believed. "We initially indicted the case because we didn't know a whole lot 
about the defendant," Amador said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought he could be a foreign national. We thought that he could be an 
assassin. We didn't know why he was here in the courthouse."  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Flint, a Nicaraguan native, is a naturalized U.S. citizen, Amador 
said. He had come to the courthouse on legitimate business involving his 
bankruptcy case and had simply forgotten to leave the gun in his car, Amador 
said. The law requires that the government prove that Flint knowingly entered 
the courthouse with a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, however, called Amador's explanation "baloney" and accused the U.S. 
attorney's office of taking the matter too lightly. "It's a very serious 
offense for . . . a person to bring a gun in the courthouse. Judges have been 
shot. Witnesses have been shot," Williams said from the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it appears likely that Flint will be freed by the end of the month, 
the standoff has mushroomed into a cause celebre from Los Angeles to 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The escalation began the day after the mid-December court hearing, when Amador 
filed a written declaration once again urging dismissal. She said Flint's 
neighbor told her that Flint had been rushing to go to the courthouse that day 
and inadvertently brought with him a gun that he sleeps with for protection 
against crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams sharply questioned whether it was an innocent mistake, noting that 
the weapon was placed in a sock and wrapped in a plastic bag. Amador countered 
that Flint regularly wrapped up the gun and kept it buried in his Lennox back 
yard during the daytime. 
</P>
<P>
 Amador, 32, who joined the U.S attorney's office in 1992, had the backing of 
her bosses. One of them, Steven G. Madison, told the judge that under Justice 
Department guidelines, prosecutors have an ethical obligation to drop a case 
"if at any time we believe that there is a doubt about the defendant's guilt, 
irrespective of what we think a jury might do." 
</P>
<P>
 But Williams, 83, a 24-year veteran of the federal bench, again refused to 
dismiss the indictment, steadfastly maintaining that a jury was entitled to 
hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 After the government filed a notice of appeal, Williams became so infuriated 
that he wrote to U.S. Atty. Gen. Janet Reno and asked her to dispatch a special 
prosecutor to handle the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The decision not to prosecute is too important to be made by a reasonably 
inexperienced assistant U.S. attorney backed up by her two lame duck superiors, 
who will leave office in two weeks," he wrote. Reno has not responded, but 
Justice Department sources say she will not grant the request. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not unusual for Justice Department lawyers to drop a 
prosecution, the Flint case is unique, according to all sides. No one 
associated with the case can remember a judge accusing federal prosecutors of 
being insufficiently aggressive. In fact, the reverse has often been the case 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Flint, confined in the Metropolitan Detention Center in Downtown Los Angeles, 
was not available to discuss his case. But there were plenty of emotional 
comments from judges, U.S. attorneys and the federal public defender's office, 
which is representing Flint. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is inconceivable that the government will not prosecute a case such as 
this one that goes to the heart of law and order in the house of law and 
order," U.S. District Judge Alicemarie H. Stotler wrote to Williams, applauding 
his stand. "We may want to barricade the front door, purchase our own 
magnetometer and perhaps carry our own side arm!" 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Dickran Tevrizian also expressed outrage at the U.S. 
attorney's office: "They really are saying, 'You judges are expendable,' " 
Tevrizian said. "This sends the wrong message to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 But another federal judge, speaking anonymously, was bewildered by Williams' 
actions. The judge suggested that Williams may be overly sensitive because the 
incident occurred in his own back yard -- the Edward R. Roybal federal 
building, where Williams has his chambers. "If this had been a prosecution of 
someone going into the Metropolitan Detention Center or a post office, I don't 
think he would have reacted this way." 
</P>
<P>
 Then-U.S. Atty. Terree A. Bowers told Reno in a Dec. 20 letter that he knew 
the office's decision had been controversial, particularly because the Justice 
Department's No.1 priority is "combatting violent crime." But he maintained 
that it was correct. 
</P>
<P>
 "I understand that there is greater concern with these types of cases because 
of a spate of recent random shootings that have received considerable 
publicity. . . . While I understand our district court judge's concern with the 
security of the courthouse, we cannot allow such visceral reactions to override 
our obligations to see that justice is served." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowers also told Reno "that on a fairly regular basis, individuals enter our 
courthouses having forgotten to remove a weapon from a satchel or briefcase. It 
is up to the Federal Protective Service and this office to determine who should 
be prosecuted criminally. Virtually all individuals are simply cited for an 
infraction ($50 fine), and released." 
</P>
<P>
 The new U.S. attorney, Nora M. Manella, has picked up where Bowers left off. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we discover information that leads us to have substantial doubt as to a 
defendant's guilt, we take whatever steps may be necessary, consistent with our 
ethical obligations, to prevent a miscarriage of justice," Manella said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she told Williams she understood his concerns -- "It remains of 
primary importance to us that the federal judges be protected and feel 
protected" -- but said the office was honor bound not to try the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Maria E. Stratton, the chief federal public defender in Los Angeles, 
frequently clashes with the U.S. attorney's office, but she praised her 
traditional adversaries for continuing their investigation and seeking a 
dismissal: "I have to credit them for going toe to toe with the judge. I 
thought it was terrific the way they didn't back down." 
</P>
<P>
 But Stratton said she is outraged that Flint is still in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 He may not be for long, though. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, responding to a motion from the U.S. attorney's office, the U.S. 
9th Circuit Court of Appeals paved the way for Flint to be released. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney had appealed Williams' refusal to dismiss the case. 
Ironically, that had the effect of keeping Flint in jail as long as the appeal 
was pending. So earlier this month, the prosecutors asked for permission to 
withdraw their appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 That request was granted Thursday and will send the case back where the 
controversy began -- Williams' courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 Manella said the U.S. attorney's office will renew its request to drop the 
charge. 
</P>
<P>
 If Williams again refuses, the U.S. attorney's office will decline to put on a 
case, Manella said, and under the federal Speedy Trial Law, Flint should be 
released within 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he still believes the case should be tried, but acknowledged 
that although he can refuse to dismiss the case, he does not have the power to 
make the U.S. attorney's office bring it to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hands are tied. I can't put on witnesses." He said that if the U.S. 
attorney does not change her mind, he will bring the case to a close. "I don't 
think he (Flint) should stay in jail forever."

JUDGE AGREES TO RESENTENCE SINGER'S FIANCEE IN DRUG AND ASSAULT CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid allegations that a district attorney's investigator provided drugs to a 
key witness, a judge Friday agreed to resentence funk singer Rick James' 
fiancee for assaulting another woman in a sensational drug and assault case. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff set aside a four-year sentence 
given to Tanya Anne Hijazi, in light of a deal that James struck with 
prosecutors that could have him out of jail by September. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoff's decision comes in the midst of what sources say is an investigation 
into allegations that a district attorney's investigator provided drugs to a 
key witness in the case against James and Hijazi. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijazi had pleaded guilty to assaulting a woman in a Sunset Boulevard hotel 
while James watched. In a plea bargain negotiated Aug. 11, she admitted 
attacking Mary Sauger of West Hollywood at the St. James' Club and hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijazi was sentenced to four years in prison on Sept. 21, four days after 
James was convicted of assaulting Sauger, 35, and of providing drugs to another 
woman who alleged that she was tortured.

 Decent exposure: Journal of the Senses, the Elysium Institute's publication, 
shows its followers standing by an "Adopt a Highway/Litter Removal" sign, which 
the group is sponsoring. The members of the nudist colony even made the supreme 
sacrifice of finding some clothes to wear while working. They no doubt figured 
that drivers on Topanga Canyon Boulevard are erratic enough.

 The first cookie opening: As we have often noted, L.A. has claimed its share 
of culinary inventions -- the chili size (Ptomaine Tommy's), the cheeseburger 
(short-order cook Lionel Sternberger), the Shirley Temple cocktail (Brown 
Derby), and the Moscow mule (Cock 'n' Bull), among others. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smithsonian magazine reminds us that L.A. should be credited with another. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fortune cookie is indisputably American," writes Stanley Karnow in the 
January issue. "It was invented in 1916 by David Jung, a Los Angeles noodle 
manufacturer." Karnow says Jung "borrowed the idea from the practice among 
ancient Chinese rebels of exchanging covert messages inside buns." 
</P>
<P>
 One country that has long spurned the prophetic dessert, by the way, is China. 
But, Karnow adds, a state-owned company in Canton will soon be churning out 
fortune cookies. The factory is being built by a noodle company from that 
well-known suburb of Beijing, Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Luckily, he has a thick skin: Even if it is an L.A. invention, Joe Roubal of 
Marina del Rey has lost faith in the sagacity of the fortune cookie. He sent 
along a message he found in a take-out order, adding that so far "no fruit or 
vegetable has shown me the slightest sign of respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Bathing in luxury: Jerry Cowle of Pacific Palisades found an ad in a local 
paper for a mansion that seems to have recreational facilities for some of the 
hired help. But what about the chauffeur?

 Faulting the Southland: L.A. is one of the few cities that has a section to 
itself in the recently published "But I Wouldn't Want to Live There! (Wicked 
Wisdom from Seasoned Travelers)," edited by Michael and Lisa Cader. Some 
excerpted taunts: 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing is wrong with Southern California that a rise in the ocean level 
wouldn't cure." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mystery novelist Ross Macdonald 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame to take this country away from the rattlesnakes." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Attributed to early-century film-maker D.W. Griffith, while shooting in the 
San Fernando Valley 
</P>
<P>
 "In Southern California the vegetables have no flavor and the flowers have no 
smell." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Author H.L. Mencken 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly enough, other books quote Mencken as having said that L.A. "stank of 
orange blossoms." We wonder if his nose ever made up its mind about our fair 
city. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But why should L.A. take this abuse alone?Let's at least quote author Molly 
Ivins on what the license plates should say in the state that sent out a Rose 
Bowl winner Jan. 1: 
</P>
<P>
 "Wisconsin -- Eat Cheese or Die." 
</P>
<P>
 There, we feel a little better now. miscelLAny: 
</P>
<P>
 Some roadways have turnouts that are observation spots. The Santa Monica 
Freeway, however, has the honor of becoming the first Southland thoroughfare to 
feature turnouts that are Accident Investigation Sites. The 12 screened-off 
sections allow drivers whose bumpers have met to exchange information (and 
insults, if necessary) in private.

LIBEL AWARD AGAINST NEWSPAPER SET ASIDE; COURTS: JUDGE RULES VERDICT 
INCONSISTENT AND $7.5-MILLION DAMAGE AWARD EXCESSIVE AND ORDERS RETRIAL OF 
BUSINESSMAN'S CLAIM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles judge ruled Friday that a $7.5-million libel award was excessive 
and ordered a new trial in a lawsuit by Beverly Hills attorney-businessman 
Leonard M. Ross against the Santa Barbara News-Press and its owner, the New 
York Times Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Harvey A. Schneider also ruled that the jury verdict was 
flawed by internal inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 In his eight-page opinion, Schneider rejected a motion for a defense verdict 
-- refusing to rule that Ross had not been libeled. 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said he agreed with "the jury's conclusion that the defendants were 
negligent, in some respects." But in ordering a new trial, Schneider said that 
was not "a sufficient basis for upholding a verdict that is inconsistent and 
excessive." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in October had awarded Ross the damages after a four-week trial 
involving investigative articles on Ross' business career. Among other things, 
Ross contended that the Santa Barbara paper falsely linked him to the misdeeds 
of his former partner, investment whiz Barry Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gratified that the court has reversed the jury's unjustified verdict," 
said Rex Heinke, a lawyer for the News-Press, the New York Times and their 
co-defendants, reporter Kathleen Sharp and editor David McCumber. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony M. Glassman, Ross' attorney, said he will file a motion for 
reconsideration because "we think the judge has made an error." If Schneider 
refuses to reinstate the judgment, Glassman said he probably will challenge 
Friday's ruling before the state Court of Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Filed more than four years ago, the lawsuit stems from articles in November, 
1988, and February, 1989, that Ross said ruined his efforts to establish a new 
business and social life in Santa Barbara. The reports described the business 
career of the man who had become the largest shareholder in Santa Barbara 
Savings & Loan, then the city's largest financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, 49, contended that the articles contained four false statements and had 
a defamatory "tenor and tone." After deliberating 3 1/2 days, jurors agreed 
that three disputed statements were false, and awarded damages of $5 million 
for harm to Ross' reputation and $2.5 million for emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of Ross' claim was that the reports falsely linked him to two 
federal criminal investigations that took place in the 1970s, early in his 
business career, although in fact he was investigated only once. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged that the newspaper correctly stated he was investigated -- but 
not charged -- by a federal grand jury, the FBI and the Organized Crime Strike 
Force in the early 1970s in an alleged extortion attempt against his former 
partner, Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ross contended -- and jurors agreed -- that the paper falsely linked him 
to a subsequent investigation of investor fraud that sent Marlin to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 It was here, however, that Schneider found the inconsistencies in the jury's 
answers to a series of special-verdict questions. While jurors said Ross had 
proven that "the tenor and tone" of the first report was that Ross was 
investigated along with Marlin for investor fraud, they elsewhere said Ross had 
not proven the falsity of a specific statement that linked him to the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 In ruling the award excessive, Schneider noted that jurors awarded $2.5 
million for emotional distress, although Ross never sought professional 
counseling and "there was no testimony . . . that he suffered severe or 
permanent harm." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Schneider said, "the court is mindful of the chilling effect that 
such an award would have on First Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also found Ross was libeled by a statement suggesting that he had 
arranged an auto accident that severely injured his former lawyer, Lynn Boyd 
Stites, with whom Ross had had a falling out. Coincidentally, Schneider's 
ruling in the Ross case came a day after Stites was sentenced in federal court 
in San Diego to more than 12 years in prison for masterminding an elaborate 
insurance fraud.

A SPORTING CHANCE; PARALYZED ATHLETE PRESENTED WITH SPECIAL HONOR FOR BEING AN 
INSPIRATION TO OTHERS

 Martin Hernandez is not bitter, or even angry. But sometimes, he says, seeing 
a baseball "gets me a little bit down." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, 19, was an aspiring baseball player and police officer when he was 
wounded in a drive-by shooting last January that left him paralyzed from the 
waist down. But with the same indomitable spirit that made him a standout 
athlete, Hernandez is determined to overcome his injury and move on with his 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 While undergoing therapy at Rancho Los Amigos Medical Center in Downey, he 
kept up with his studies and graduated with classmates at Leuzinger High School 
in Lawndale last June. Now a mass communications major at El Camino College 
near Torrance, Hernandez also finds time to play wheelchair basketball and 
tennis and to continue serving as a Los Angeles County Sheriff's Explorer. 
</P>
<P>
 In recognition of his accomplishments, Colours 'N Motion, an Anaheim-based 
wheelchair manufacturer, joined Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block on 
Friday in presenting Hernandez with a specially designed lightweight wheelchair 
made of aluminum. The chair is easier to maneuver, especially on a basketball 
or tennis court. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to improve my ability to play sports, and most of the things I'm 
trying to accomplish," Hernandez said of his new gift, presented during a brief 
ceremony at the Audrey and Sidney Irmas Youth Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "Thank you very much," Hernandez said. "I won't let you down. I'm going to 
keep improving myself more and more." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Box, owner of Colours 'N Motion who himself was paralyzed after a 
motorcycle accident in 1981, said he first learned about Hernandez during a 
conversation with Block in November and wanted to do something for the young 
man. Box said the wheelchair, which he designed and would normally cost about 
$1,800, will enable Hernandez to play a variety of sports. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are proud to make this donation," Box said. "He deserves it." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin's brother Alberto, 22, stood a few feet away, beaming. "After the 
accident, I thought he would give up," Alberto Hernandez said. "But he hasn't. 
It's taught me a lesson. Never give up on your dreams. No matter what happens, 
just keep on going." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Hernandez of Inglewood was standing with a group of friends outside a 
party in Hawthorne last Jan. 22 when he was struck by a bullet fired from a 
passing car. The bullet pierced his chest, just missed his heart and lodged in 
his spine, crippling him for life. 
</P>
<P>
 The news shattered family members, who had watched him work hard at baseball 
in hopes it could be a ticket to higher education. Hernandez, a B student who 
took advanced classes, had been trying to obtain such a baseball scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 But Hernandez said his ultimate goal was to become a sheriff's deputy, "to 
help people out anyway I can." A 1992 graduate of the sheriff's Explorer 
program, he was working at the Lennox station at the time he was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "What makes him extra special is that here is a young man in the very prime of 
his life who was cut down," Block said. "It would have been very easy for him 
to give up. Instead, he was determined to fight this. I think he is an 
inspiration not only to other young people but to all of us." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Block said that the two individuals responsible for Hernandez's injury were 
arrested and convicted of the crime, with one now serving a 16-year sentence 
and the other a seven-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said he is not angry at his assailants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a grudge against anybody," he said. "I just hope they learned 
their lesson, just by seeing what they did, by realizing what they did was 
wrong and making a change. That would be the best thing that could happen. 
Instead of them getting out of jail and doing the same thing."

CHURCHES TRYING TO BRING 'BABY BUSTERS' BACK INTO THE FOLD; YOUTH: SPECIAL 
SERVICES AND OUTREACH EFFORTS ARE AIMED AT 18-TO-35 AGE GROUP NOT SERVED BY 
FAMILY MINISTRIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rev. Ed Young is not afraid to throw a football at "baby busters" in his 
Southern Baptist church. Other churches will schedule special services just for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Roman Catholic Church, seeking to capitalize on the success of World 
Youth Day last summer, recently decided to develop a national pastoral plan for 
its 18- to 35-year-old members. 
</P>
<P>
 They are the in-between generation, many of whom have left the sanctum of 
religious youth education but have not found their place in churches that 
emphasize family ministries. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, many churches were resigned to losing some youths in their early 
20s, writing them off as part of a youthful search for independence that would 
end with their return after marriage when they would seek a religious home for 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 But new research shows that in an increasingly secular society where the 
traditional two-parent family and social pressures for religious affiliation 
are declining, there are no guarantees that baby busters will ever return. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, religious groups are learning new ways to attract and keep young 
adults in the pews. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to build on the enthusiasm of the tens of thousands of high school 
students who attended World Youth Day called by Pope John Paul II in Denver, 
U.S. Catholic bishops recently approved a three-year project to develop 
ministry programs for young adults. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that the development of a ministry for this age group will say loud 
and clear that not only is there a place for young adults in the Catholic 
Church, but there is also a need for them to take on more responsibility for 
what the church does," said Msgr. Dennis Schnurr, executive director of World 
Youth Day. "We're not about to squander the idealism and enthusiasm we saw at 
World Youth Day." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Henderson, a national youth specialist for the Catholic Church, said many 
young adults have said they are looking for a sense of belonging in a church 
that often orients its ministries to families. 
</P>
<P>
 They do not necessarily have to lead the parish council, he said. "A lot of 
times, it's something much more simple -- just to be acknowledged that they're 
there," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some important differences in the baby buster generation, church 
leaders say. In general, they are waiting longer to marry, postponing a natural 
port of entry into the church when they have children. 
</P>
<P>
 And clergy can forget about many members of the 22-to-35 age group sticking 
around if there are no programs for their age groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to jump in with both feet," said the Rev. Linda Grenz, coordinator 
of adult education for the Episcopal Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Some successful ministries for young adults include offering four- to six-week 
classes that give them lots of options and do not force them to make long-term 
commitments, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some churches even create "parallel congregations" to offer services for baby 
boomers and busters that give them the environment and music that is meaningful 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
 If they are not involved in the church by the third or fourth visit, young 
adults may look elsewhere, Grenz said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Fellowship of Las Colinas in a Dallas suburb, Young does not even wait 
that long to get people involved. After their first visit, he enlists young 
adults in such ministries as greeting people in the parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Young also keeps his services under an hour, and uses videotape and drama to 
get his message across to young adults. On "Cowboy Days," Young may dress in a 
football uniform and throw a pigskin into the seats at services. 
</P>
<P>
 But if they sometimes seem like a demanding generation, they also can be 
rewarding to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm really excited about this age group because they're spontaneous. They're 
fun to talk to and they add a lot of excitement to the church," Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an enthusiasm for the faith. At the same time, there is a certain 
frustration . . . what are the channels" for participation, Schnurr said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he sees change occurring. The Second Vatican Council gave the laity an 
increased role in several ministries. Although older adults tended to be the 
first to take on those roles, Schnurr said, the church has gone through a 
generation of increased lay participation and "the young adults are beginning 
to make their presence known."

AILING HEIR TO MORMON PRESIDENCY BACK AT POST; SUCCESSION: IF THE 86-YEAR-OLD 
SENIOR APOSTLE IS TOO ILL TO ASSUME LEADERSHIP, IT WILL LEAVE CHURCH IN 
'TERRIBLE QUANDARY,' OFFICIALS SAY. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 He is frail and cannot walk without help, but the 86-year-old heir to the 
mantle of prophet to more than 8 million Mormons worldwide is back at work. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard W. Hunter, president of the Council of the 12 Apostles, spent nearly 
six months recuperating from gallbladder surgery in May. He has made the trip 
from his home to the church's Administration Building almost daily for the past 
two months. 
</P>
<P>
 The state of Hunter's health is critical to the Church of Jesus Christ of 
Latter-day Saints, whose president, Ezra Taft Benson, 94, has been frail for 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 The church will not comment on Benson's condition except in the vaguest terms. 
However, this summer, his grandson, Pulitzer Prize-winning editorial cartoonist 
Steve Benson said the church president is confined to his apartment under a 
nurse's care. Age, he said, has stilled the elder Benson's voice and clouded 
his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter's health is also a concern because at no time in the faith's 163-year 
history has a designated successor been too frail or sick to assume the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a situation would leave the church "in a terrible quandary," and not just 
for ecclesiastical reasons, said D. Michael Quinn, author of an upcoming book 
on the Mormon hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 The governing First Presidency -- made up of Benson and his two counselors -- 
has become the center of the faith's multibillion-dollar corporate structure, 
Quinn said. 
</P>
<P>
 Church presidents serve for life and are chosen through a strict tradition of 
apostolic succession based on seniority within the Council of the 12 Apostles. 
If the senior apostle, in this case Hunter, were mentally disabled, either 
through age or for some other reason, there is no doctrinal precedent for 
filling the role and the corporation could founder. 
</P>
<P>
 But the church may not be faced with that dilemma. Those close to Hunter, who 
suffered a recent bout of the flu, say that his overall health is relatively 
good. "He's doing remarkably well," said Hunter's son, Richard, of San Jose, 
Calif. "I find it incredible, bouncing back the way he does." 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hunter and church spokesman Don LeFevre said that for the past month 
or so, the senior Hunter has been at the office "virtually every day," often 
working six or seven hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has felt well enough to attend his regular meetings and to handle his 
responsibilities as president of the Council of 12 Apostles from his office," 
LeFevre said in a statement. Hunter declined to be interviewed, as did other 
council members.  
</P>
<P>
 Hunter, a Boise, Ida., native and a corporate attorney who lived in Los 
Angeles for more than 30 years before moving here, has suffered a variety of 
ailments: a heart attack, bypass surgery and weakened legs that have forced him 
to use a walker. He spends much of his time in a wheelchair. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, Hunter lost his balance and fell while speaking at the church's 
general conference. He pulled himself back to the podium and completed the 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
 His health problems and the loss of his first wife in 1983 led to a bout with 
depression. He remarried in 1990, at age 82. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter requires help getting into his walker, Richard Hunter said, although 
sometimes he can push himself up from a sitting position. 
</P>
<P>
 His most serious problems came last spring when he went into the hospital for 
a gallbladder operation. Hunter's condition deteriorated after the May 10 
surgery and he spent four weeks in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, we all would have hoped the recovery would have happened more 
quickly," Richard Hunter said. "But before the surgery, he was told then that 
he wouldn't be doing what he's doing now, so you have to measure by that." 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually every conversation about Hunter includes the caveat, "For a man of 
his age . . . " It is no secret that his 86 years have left him physically 
frail, although apparently mentally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunter was named to the council in 1959. If he becomes president, he will be 
the first Mormon leader born in the 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon B. Hinckley, 83, Benson's first counselor, follows Hunter. 
</P>
<P>
 Since church founder Joseph Smith's murder in 1844, the 11 presidents before 
Benson averaged 85 years of age at death. The average age today of the 
three-member First Presidency and the Council of the 12 Apostles is 74. 
</P>
<P>
 When a church president dies, the First Presidency is dissolved and the 
council and former counselors meet in the Salt Lake Temple to ordain the new 
president. He picks his counselors, and the trio immediately execute a variety 
of documents that ensure a smooth transition. 
</P>
<P>
 That could not happen if the senior apostle were mentally incapacitated, Quinn 
said. In the 19th Century, the church was able to operate without a First 
Presidency, and did so on three occasions. It would be more difficult, if not 
impossible, for that to happen now. 
</P>
<P>
 Given his understanding of Hunter's health, Quinn said a change in leadership 
now would be relatively uneventful.

 The life and work of civilrights leader Martin Luther King Jr. will be 
celebrated Sunday and Monday at Occidental College in Los Angeles with an 
interfaith observance and conference titled "Building a Human Rights Agenda for 
the 21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 Congressional Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton (D-D.C.) will kick off the 
conference at 8 p.m. Sunday with a keynote address, "Human Rights and the 
Legacy of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr." Norton has served two terms in 
Congress and chaired the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission under 
President Jimmy Carter. She is a professor of law at Georgetown University. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Crahan, Luce professor of religion, power and the political process 
at Occidental, said she organized the conference at the request of students 
because "although many human rights crises were resolved in the '60s, '70s and 
'80s, new crises around the world now threaten the survival of democracy in the 
21st Century." 
</P>
<P>
 After a 9 a.m. session Monday of student-led panels on human rights concerns, 
there will be a discussion from 1:30 p.m. to 5 p.m. of some proposals on civil 
and human rights, and environmental issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The panelists include Ilene Cohn, election officer for the U.N. Observer 
Mission in El Salvador; Clarence J. Dias, president of the International Center 
for Law and Development; Abdullahi An-Na'im, executive director of Africa 
Watch; Jan Urban, activist with the Center for Independent Journalism; William 
Weinberger, co-chairman of the National Lesbian and Gay Law Assn.; Carol Lujan, 
assistant professor in the School of Justice Studies at Arizona State 
University; Dorothy Thomas, director of the Women's Rights Project of Human 
Rights Watch, and Ellen Lutz, California director of Human Rights Watch. 
</P>
<P>
 Crahan will lead a 7 p.m. discussion of international perspectives on human 
rights. Joining some of the afternoon panelists will be Elizabeth Lira, 
executive director of the Latin American Institute of Mental Health and Human 
Rights; Eric Goldstein, research director of Middle East Watch, and Elahe 
Sharif-Pour, an attorney with the U.N. International Civilian Human Rights 
Monitoring Mission in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Preceding the conference is an interfaith celebration, "Reflections on the 
Dream," at 1 p.m. Sunday. The Rev. John M. Perkins, author and founder of the 
John M. Perkins Foundation for Reconciliation and Development and the Harambee 
Christian Family Center in Pasadena, will be the keynote speaker. 
</P>
<P>
 Occidental College is at 1600 Campus Road, Eagle Rock. The interfaith 
celebration will be held at Herrick Memorial Chapel and Interfaith Center (213) 
259-2621. The conference will be at Thorne Hall (213) 259-2677. The conference 
is free and open to the public.

PERSPECTIVES / LETTERS; IT IS ARROGANT TO DEBATE WHAT JESUS REALLY SAID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: "Two Views of What Jesus Really Said" (Book review, Jan. 8): 
</P>
<P>
 The Times reported that biblical scholars have determined that Jesus Christ 
didn't utter most of the sayings ascribed to him in the Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 The crass arrogance of these so-called scholars to contend that they know what 
Jesus said and what he didn't is beyond description.

PERSPECTIVES / LETTERS; HOORAY FOR YOUTHS PLEDGING CHASTITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was refreshing to read that thousands of youth all over America are saving 
sex for marriage. ("Youths at Baptist Convention Pledge Chastity Till 
Marriage," Jan. 8). 
</P>
<P>
 In the '60s, the saying was "never trust anyone over 30." Perhaps teens today 
could say the same thing. So many adults in their lives, including authority 
figures, say the young can't control their sexual urges and must be medicated, 
fitted and rubberized. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps these youngsters see through the "safe sex" message because sexually 
transmitted diseases are now epidemic in our country. Today there are about 20 
significant STDs (compared to two 30 years ago). . . . Sixty-three percent of 
new infections occur in the under-25 age group. 
</P>
<P>
 The teens who are taking the Chastity Pledge have decided not to listen to 
their unwise elders -- including Dr. Joycelyn Elders, surgeon general. Hooray!

LIFTING VIETNAM TRADE EMBARGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I agree with your editorial, "Vietnam Trade: Time for the Leap" (Jan. 5). It 
is time to end the U.S. economic embargo of Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Our government initiated the embargo against North Vietnam in 1964 and against 
the entire country in 1975. It has been kept in place since then ostensibly to 
punish its government for its intransigence and non-cooperation with the MIA 
issue. Our current policy needs to be revised not only because it hasn't worked 
but also because it is becoming obvious that the Vietnamese are being as 
forthcoming and cooperative as can reasonably be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 6 the United States launched its biggest search ever in Vietnam for 
Americans missing in action. The Vietnamese have turned over uncounted tons of 
evidence, records, personal effects and remains of the missing. They have 
allowed continuous and thorough investigations of all air crash sites and 
so-called "live sightings" reports. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when the U.S.-led embargo really hurt Vietnam. That is no 
longer the case. The rest of the world long ago disregarded the embargo and 
began to make large-scale investment and trade with Vietnam a high priority.  
</P>
<P>
 I traveled to Vietnam this last summer as part of a delegation of Vietnam 
veterans and others interested in healing the wounds of that war. We came away 
from that experience convinced that the people there bear us no ill will. They 
want to put the bad times behind us -- they want to be friends. What made me 
sad was the realization that while the embargo seems to have had little impact 
on the way that their government makes its decisions, it nevertheless has an 
injurious effect on the people. 
</P>
<P>
 Without question, Vietnam has a long way to go toward opening up or 
liberalizing its society. What seems most obvious is that the surest road to 
democratic reform there lies in the breaking down of the barriers to the 
exchange of culture and information, which will come as a natural result of 
commerce once things are normalized.

KEEPING KIDS' HEADS OFF COLLISION COURSE; ELEVEN-YEAR-OLD BICYCLIST SHOWS WHY 
IT'S COOL TO WEAR A HELMET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marcia White's cracked bicycle helmet left her schoolmates at Isaac L. Sowers 
Middle School in Huntington Beach imagining in horror what might have been. 
They got plenty to think about when the sixth-grader returned to class wearing 
a smile the day after she collided with a car as she bicycled home from school. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Her helmet shattered the windshield and then broke on impact with the 
pavement. The 11-year-old was wearing the headgear in compliance with the state 
law, effective Jan. 1, that requires minors to wear state-approved helmets 
while cycling. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia was one of the first in the state to realize the practical wisdom of 
the new law. And like hundreds of other students at Sowers, she was obeying a 
school district policy that went into effect at the same time.  
</P>
<P>
 This is one youngster whose own good sense was supported actively by parents 
and school authorities. That's the kind of cooperation it takes to win over 
those children who think "it's not cool" to wear a helmet. Moreover, the 
penalties for violating the new law aren't likely to be much of an incentive, 
nor are busy police likely to enforce it heavily. In the first year, only 
warnings will be issued; warnings are to be followed in 1995 by fines of up to 
$25. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the most persuasive case for the new law is made through experiences 
like Marcia's. There no doubt are still many stragglers around Southern 
California, like the dozen or so of Marcia's schoolmates who have been scolded 
by the principal for not wearing helmets. If these students were not persuaded 
by the new law -- and their parents have not already been convinced by 
statistics showing bicycle-related accidents to be the No. 1 cause of death and 
brain injury among children between 5 and 14 -- then the sight of a healthy 
Marcia White returning to ride another day should be an inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature should hold hearings later this year to assess the effects of 
the requirement and whether the helmet standards, as they now stand, are 
adequate or require further toughening.

CAREFUL, HE'S NOT MR. NICE GUY; SURE, SHAKE ASSAD'S HAND, BUT DON'T GO MUCH 
BEYOND THAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A few hours from now, President Clinton is scheduled to shake hands in Geneva 
with President Hafez Assad of Syria, a gesture of high-level recognition -- if 
not of approbation -- that Washington hopes will help induce one of the Arab 
world's more durable and ruthless dictators to resume peace negotiations with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 The Syria-Israel talks, which have been held sporadically along with other 
bilateral negotiations as part of the U.S.-sponsored Middle East peace process, 
were suspended last fall. Syria has said there's nothing more to talk about 
until Israel first commits itself to withdraw from the Golan Heights, the 
strategic plateau overlooking northern Israel that Israeli troops occupied in 
the 1967 war. Israel says discussion of its withdrawal will go on the table as 
soon as Syria spells out what kind of a peace agreement it is ready to make. 
Such incompatible conditions inevitably have led to deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 HAPPY AS A SPOILER: It would of course be desirable to re-enlist Syria as a 
fully involved partner in the peace process, alongside Jordan and the Palestine 
Liberation Organization. (Lebanon, the fourth Arab party in the talks, remains 
under partial occupation by the Syrian army, and is compelled to do what 
Damascus wants in this regard.) 
</P>
<P>
 If Syria commits to ending its long war with Israel the prospects for lasting 
accommodation in the eastern Mediterranean -- including, probably, an explosion 
in economic growth -- would be far brighter. If it stays outside the peace 
process, Syria almost certainly would continue to play its familiar role of 
spoiler, supporting the radical Iran-inspired Islamic group Hezbollah in 
southern Lebanon and doing what it could generally to subvert whatever progress 
Jordan and the Palestinians might make with Israel. If nothing else, Assad 
would be able to claim that he continues to stand at the head of those Arabs 
who reject all political and territorial compromises with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Assad might well indicate to Clinton that he could be drawn back into the 
peace process if the price was right. One thing he very much wants is for the 
State Department to drop Syria from its list of countries that support 
international terrorism. That would be a mistake. Syria has richly earned a 
place on the list by its deeds. It should be erased from the list not for 
expedient political reasons but only when it has clearly shown that it no 
longer supports terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 CREDITOR'S CALL: The fact is that Syria is not playing with a very strong hand 
when it comes to setting terms for rejoining the peace process. The 
considerable economic, military and political support Assad could once count on 
from the Soviet Union has disappeared. Indeed, Russia now wants the 
hard-pressed Damascus regime to repay its $8-billion debt to Moscow, and 
reportedly is holding up shipments of military spare parts until it starts to 
do so. Syria needs good relations and closer economic ties with the West. Even 
more important for the long term, it would benefit, along with others in the 
region, from the economic dividend that a successful peace process surely would 
produce. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaching an accommodation with Israel and behaving responsibly after that are 
not gifts to be bestowed, but something Syria should do in its own interests. 
Not least, it could help promote Assad's ambition to restore Damascus as the 
hub of Arab cultural and political affairs. The self-interest argument is one 
Clinton should emphasize. What he should not do is hand Assad any unearned 
rewards to try to lure him back to the conference table. He should not get 
involved, either, in any substantive negotiations over either the terms for his 
return or -- more dangerously -- the terms of an Israel-Syria agreement. The 
strongest message Clinton can deliver is that peace will bring its own rewards. 
But peace can come about only through negotiations.

BIRTHS TO 59-YEAR-OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * It is amusing to note that with all the hue and cry about the 59-year-old 
woman giving birth to twins (Dec. 28), resulting in calls to limit the use of 
"enhanced fertility technology" to women of appropriate childbearing age, no 
one has thought to, in parallel, require vasectomies on all men over the same 
appropriate childbearing age.

REBELLION IN MEXICO AND NAFTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The rebels in Chiapas followed their own timetable (Jan. 4). Such a 
large-scale operation obviously required long-range planning. The fact that it 
coincided with the implementation of NAFTA may or may not have been deliberate. 
But the relationship to NAFTA is evident. 
</P>
<P>
 NAFTA is one of several recent actions by the Mexican government which favor 
wealthy investors over Mexico's people. Another such action was the abolishment 
of the ejido system of land tenure, which had previously protected small 
farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 The elite of the world ignore the rights of the poor until the poor force them 
to pay attention. Indigenous people of Chiapas reacted to policies of which 
NAFTA is a part. 
</P>
<P>
 What NAFTA is to Mexico, GATT is to the world. Indigenous and poor people 
everywhere have much to fear from this so-called free trade. 
</P>
<P>
 PATRICK BONNER

</P>
<P>
 * The violent uprising in Mexico indicates not everyone is completely sold on 
free trade and capitalism. Since the fall of communism in Eastern Europe, 
capitalism has become synonymous with freedom and human rights. But history has 
shown that capitalism also can breed economic slavery and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweatshops of the early 1900s are a good example of the underside of 
capitalism. A few men became wealthy while others, including children, were 
exploited and made to work long hours just to survive. These abuses spawned 
unions to protect workers and laws like the minimum wage to even the playing 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 While NAFTA may be economically good for Mexico, it will surely destroy the 
country's way of life. I enjoy Mexico for its slow pace and uniqueness, not its 
beaches or accommodations. It would be a shame to see Mexico sell its soul for 
a few more pesos. 
</P>
<P>
 CLEM DOMINGUEZ

</P>
<P>
 * Your articles concerning the uprising in Chiapas miss the most obvious 
(unmentioned) fact: These peasants are rebelling against Mexico because it is a 
brutal despotism which practices institutionalized torture and death 
squad-style executions. Any union organizer or an opposition journalist is 
likely to be found face down in a ditch outside Mexico City, his (or her) body 
covered with bruises, cuts, or missing appendages, courtesy of the 
American-trained paramilitary counterinsurgency squads (which would explain any 
puzzling request of the rebels for the U.S. to stop training Mexican "police"). 
Until the government corresponds to internationally accepted norms of conduct 
and the corporate-owned PRI is replaced with a liberal democracy, there can be 
no end to the bloodshed.

NURSE ANESTHETISTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As president of the American Assn. of Nurse Anesthetists, and educator in 
the Kaiser Permanente system here in Los Angeles, I felt it important to set 
the record straight after reading the Dec. 17 letter of Dr. Marie Kuffner's 
(immediate past president of the Los Angeles County Medical Assn.) on the role 
of nurse practitioners, with special focus on certified registered nurse 
anesthetists (CRNAs). It is notable that Dr. Kuffner, although addressing nurse 
anesthetists, neglected to mention her own specialty -- she is a practicing 
anesthesiologist.  
</P>
<P>
 CRNAs are most definitely sole providers in 85% of rural hospitals in the 
United States (whereby they serve 60 million Americans -- a population mix 
three times the size of Canada.) These practitioners enable the rural medical 
facilities to provide obstetrics, essential surgical, emergency and trauma 
stabilization services. As professional registered nurses, CRNAs are 
independently licensed to practice nursing within the scope of nurse practice 
acts and other regulations in each of the 50 states. Some licensing laws 
require the CRNA to work under the "supervision" of or in "collaboration with" 
a physician, such as a surgeon, dentist, or podiatrist. (In the state of 
California, no such "supervision" clause is utilized in the statute.) However, 
as far as anesthesia is concerned, as CRNAs we are legally responsible for our 
own decisions and services. 
</P>
<P>
 CRNAs administer anesthesia for all types of surgical cases. Based upon a 1988 
study by the Center for Health Economics Research, nurse anesthetists were 
regularly involved in the same kinds of anesthesia procedures -- from the most 
simple to the most complex -- as were anesthesiologists. Furthermore, multiple 
studies have not demonstrated any significant difference in quality of care 
between nurse anesthetists and anesthesiologists. 
</P>
<P>
 And, what about education? The most substantial difference between CRNAs and 
anesthesiologists is that prior to anesthesia education, anesthesiologists 
receive medical education while CRNAs receive nursing education. However, the 
anesthesia part of the education is very similar for both providers. Nurse 
anesthesia education programs involve 24-36 months of graduate work, including 
both classroom and clinical experiences. The classroom curriculum emphasizes 
the following in relation to anesthesia: anatomy, physiology, pathophysiology, 
biochemistry, chemistry, physics and a minimum of 90 hours of pharmacology. The 
primary clinical component provides experience with a variety of anesthesia 
techniques and procedures for all types of surgery and obstetrics. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, to hold the credential of CRNA, the graduate must pass a 
national certification examination, and thereafter, meet specific continuing 
education requirements biennially for the rest of his or her professional life.

BALLOT INITIATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * This is one citizen who was less than saddened to learn that it will be a 
bad year for ballot initiatives (Jan. 5). 
</P>
<P>
 While noble in intention, this lawmaking process is a disaster. To expect the 
average voter to read, research and understand the volumes of information 
required to make intelligent decisions is unrealistic. Prop. 103, for example, 
was an absurd, simplistic approach to rising insurance costs.  
</P>
<P>
 The death of potentially harmful initiatives such as pay-at-the-pump should be 
a cause for celebration.

3 TOURISTS SHOT OUTSIDE SAN FRANCISCO BAR; VIOLENCE: ATTACK IS THE LATEST IN A 
SERIES ON VISITORS. WOUNDED MEN APPEAR TO BE BYSTANDERS TO AN ARGUMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three tourists were shot and wounded early Friday in San Francisco's 
Haight-Ashbury district, the latest in a series of attacks on visitors during 
the past six months. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two victims in the 2 a.m. shooting outside a bar appeared to have 
been bystanders, San Francisco police Inspector James Spillane said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nobody has been arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 The trouble began when an argument erupted at closing time between two men 
walking their dogs and a group of about 20 patrons leaving the bar, Spillane 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the dog walkers pulled out an automatic pistol and fired into the 
crowd, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 William Hunt, 25, of Richmond, Va., was shot five times. He was in critical 
condition at San Francisco General Hospital on Friday, a nursing supervisor 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two men who were not with him and did not get involved in the argument were 
shot in the legs. Those two, William Wilson, 29, of San Diego and Miles 
Decotiis, 23, of Santa Cruz were treated and released from Mt. Zion Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men with the dogs fled. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting follows four other attacks on tourists this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Two French teachers were beaten and robbed in the Western Addition, two 
Japanese women were mugged at the cable car turnaround near Fisherman's Wharf, 
an Irish student was shot during a robbery on the wharf and an elderly woman 
from Brooklyn, N.Y., was assaulted outside the St. Francis Hotel.

TV REVIEW; DIANA ROSS IN 'DARKNESS' SPOTLIGHT; HER IMPRESSIVE ACTING IN ABC'S 
'OUT OF DARKNESS' ON SUNDAY IS A SHATTERING PORTRAIT OF A WOMAN BESET BY 
'VOICES AND DEMONS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Diana Ross, essentially forgotten as an actress, has re-emerged after a 
shockingly long, self-imposed 16-year absence from the movies. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a considerable return it is. "Out of Darkness" (at 9 p.m. Sunday on 
ABC, Channels 7, 3, 10 and 42) is Ross' shattering portrait of a woman's battle 
with paranoia/schizophrenia, experienced even in her better moments as "voices 
and demons." 
</P>
<P>
 The pop diva image is nowhere to be seen. Instead Ross galvanizes essentially 
every scene in a performance so impressively controlled and cliche-free that 
Ross must rank as Hollywood's best-kept acting secret. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems her acting debut 22 years ago in "Lady Sings the Blues," for which 
she deserved but lost the Oscar to Liza Minnelli (for "Cabaret"), was no fluke 
after all. But after her steep nose dive with "Mahogany" (1975) and a so-so 
attempt to reignite her screen career with "The Wiz" (1978), Ross dropped out 
of the acting business like a falling comet. 
</P>
<P>
 True, special scripts were hard to come by and Ross did recently get "scooped" 
(her own description) trying to lift a Josephine Baker project off the ground, 
but 16 years? 
</P>
<P>
 Out of darkness, indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anyway, Ross, in her dramatic TV debut, has reinvented herself in a 
performance certain to recharge her acting career. And as co-executive 
producer, she helped flap together a distinguished production, beginning with 
the richly observant, well-researched screenplay by Barbara Turner and the 
expressive direction of Larry Elikann. 
</P>
<P>
 As Norma Desmond might say, Ross does bring a face to the screen. But only 
slowly do the feverish eyes and hard edges melt away following the last-ditch 
recourse of a psychiatrist (Lindsey Crouse) to free her with an experimental 
drug called clozapine. 
</P>
<P>
 When we meet Ross' deteriorating Paulie Cooper, she's in mad repose, staring 
through her bedroom window. She's 42, a onetime promising medical student and 
flower of everyone's eye whose life stopped at 25 and who's been in and out of 
mental hospitals for 17 years. We never sense the real source of Paulie's 
illness, except once when she self-mockingly describes herself as "my father's 
son," a curdling line. 
</P>
<P>
 The camera glides over Paulie's physical world, a wonderful old California 
Craftsman-style house on a peaceful block in L.A. and a protective, loving, 
expanded family that is helpless and even caged in its love: Paulie's vigorous 
mother (Ann Weldon), her endearing grandmother (Beah Richards), her wary, 
bright 10-year-old daughter (Chasiti Hampton) and her simmering sibling rival 
of a sister (Rhonda Stubbins White). 
</P>
<P>
 In "Out of Darkness," glamour takes a big holiday. But Ross doesn't need a 
stylish performance number to lean back on -- unlike her previous three movies 
and Ross' future ABC movie about the true-life Nazi concentration camp ordeal 
of little-known American jazz singer Valaida Snow (which was recently produced 
as a play in Studio City). 
</P>
<P>
 For the first half of the movie, Ross' stringy hair, puffy eyes and 
alternately glazed and fierce demeanor create evocative imprints. The dialogue 
is frequently jolting. "I'm a slut and I'm rotting inside," Paulie tells her 
mother. Later she tells a shrink that "my brain's been stolen, and it's going 
to the master machine that collects all brains." Later comes a sudden, blunt 
self-portrait: "I'm black and I'm getting blacker in here" (a psychiatric 
center). 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Caroming between stays at home and psychiatric live-in centers (where team 
therapy sessions catch some of the flavor of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's 
Nest"), Ross rips apart a bathroom shower, sheds her clothes and cowers naked 
in the rain in a public street, and, subtle cruelty cracking the corners of her 
mouth, pours poison into her sister's soda pop. 
</P>
<P>
 As fear rules the deceptive warmth inside the house, her mom, the 
larger-than-life Weldon, bars her bedroom door at night and remarks of her 
daughter: "She has a terminal illness but never dies." 
</P>
<P>
 The material, which could have been so bloody predictable, is kept surging by 
not only Ross and a fine cast (especially check out Juanita Jennings' vibrant 
health specialist) but also by the movie's episodic blackouts, which enhance 
the action and the rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 But even Paulie's return to health is sobering. Emblematic is a failed 
romantic encounter with an eligible bachelor too good to be true (Carl Lumbly) 
and a quietly numbing fade-out -- the perfect way to end this story.

MOVIE REVIEW; A GOOD PREMISE GETS LOST IN 'WEEKEND' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The budget for Gregory Neri's "A Weekend With Barbara Und Ingrid" is so micro 
-- $59,313, according to the press kit -- that knocking it makes one feel like 
a clomping Godzilla. But despite an intriguing premise, this maundering malaise 
of a comedy is a chore to sit through (clomp).The pacing is slack (clomp, 
clomp), the acting doodly ( clomp ) and -- well, why go on?  
</P>
<P>
 It's about a failed L.A. poet (Jim Metzler) who writes bird cage manuals and 
whose girlfriend walks out on him just in time for Labor Day weekend. He wants 
to wall himself in with his misery but he's visited by two German performance 
artists, Barbara (Anna Katarina) und Ingrid (Michelle Holmes), who claim they 
hooked up with his former flame overseas. They camp out in his pad and before 
long we're inundated with life lessons and free-spirited falderal. (It plays 
Saturday and Sunday matinees at the Laemmle Sunset 5.) Metzler, who was 
excellent in "One False Move" a few years back, tries to excavate the comedy 
from his role and, in a bit part as a Jerry Lewis-like telethon host -- he's 
called Jerzy Louis here -- performance artist John Fleck has some tart moments 
of (very) low comedy.

THEATER REVIEW; 'FUNNY GAY MALES' LACKS TOGETHERNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Truth in advertising is alive and well at Highways. "Funny Gay Males," the 
latest comedy act to occupy the Santa Monica alternative theater's stage, 
delivers as promised. The New York-based trio is funny, gay and male. But 
what's implied in the title -- collective creation by an ensemble operating for 
a common cause -- never materializes. 
</P>
<P>
 These three guys claim to have been on the road together for five years. But 
they're not on stage as a troupe more than five minutes. The evening is divided 
into thirds. Each comic performs a solo turn showcasing his talent. We could be 
in any comedy club, witnessing more stand-up shtick. 
</P>
<P>
 Danny McWilliams has an impish size and elastic face. He describes a childhood 
in Queens, N.Y., as an Irish Catholic homosexual avoiding grim nuns. He 
brilliantly impersonates heavy-set, elderly women, but his cliched sketches on 
the "Wizard of Oz" belong in a comedy museum. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Smith is tall, austere and literary. He outlines a childhood in Buffalo, 
N.Y., as "a gay kid who wasn't afraid of the dark, but was afraid of 
unflattering light." An inspired ploy occurs when Smith reads from actual 
grade-school report cards. The teacher's comments suggest that even in 
elementary school, Smith's sexual orientation was obvious. But his family 
denied it, and a gay comic was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe Cohen's Jewish Angst humor provides slight variations on familiar 
themes. Being gay has little to do with his modest jokes. But his routine about 
high school gym class is hysterical. (Remember "dodge ball"?) Otherwise, 
Cohen's sketches, like those of McWilliams and Smith, prove rather soft-focus 
and PG, lacking political comment or psychological insights. 
</P>
<P>
 After their 30-minute stand-up routines, the three briefly reunite to thank 
the audience, then gather at the exit, shaking hands as if it's a gay wedding 
party. Maybe that last gesture should become part of their act. At least then 
they're working the room together. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Funny Gay Males," Highways, 1651 18th St., Santa Monica. Tonight at 8:30, 
Sunday, 7:30 p.m. Ends Sunday. $10. (213) 660-8587. Running time: 1 hour, 30 
minutes.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; WILLIAMS BROTHERS SINCERE BUT LIMITED AT TROUBADOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD CROMELIN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Don't Look Now," the Williams Brothers' AIDS lament, typifies the duo's chief 
strength and major weakness. Their performance of the song at the Troubadour on 
Thursday was intensely earnest, but its message is stated so obviously and 
blandly that it registers only lightly on the emotional scale. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, Andrew and David Williams have become fixtures on 
L.A.'s bohemian folk-pop scene, and at the Troubadour you could see how their 
sincere, coffeehouse-casual manner and attractive sound would draw a following. 
Their limitations were equally evident. 
</P>
<P>
 Starting in an austere, downbeat folk mode and building to a full, amplified 
folk sound, the 30ish twins framed their wistful romanticism, their 
psychotherapy-style childhood recollections and their pleas for tolerance in 
society in well-crafted settings that occasionally created a rich, evocative 
mood. 
</P>
<P>
 They ultimately added accordion and mandolin (by frequent playing and writing 
partner Marvin Etzioni) to their drums and cello support, but, despite these 
instrumental resources, their music was surprisingly monochromatic, and the 
brothers' smooth harmonies lacked the kind of bite that creates character and 
delivers complex emotions. They seem to come by their earnestness honestly 
enough, but they simply don't appear equipped to test deep waters. RICHARD

TUNE IN LOCAL TV NEWS TO CATCH THE JOKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thank you for your informative interview with John Beard ("At Channel 11 News, 
'It Just Feels Better,' " Jan. 8). We concur absolutely with Beard regarding 
KNBC-TV local news coverage -- frankly, it's a joke. KNBC, along with KCBS and 
KABC, delivers news that insults every viewer's intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 We could care less about the Michael Jackson situation until all the facts are 
in. (Thanks anyway, KNBC!) 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas KABC previously led the pack in sensationalizing the news, KNBC has 
now taken over that ranking. If blood, gore, porn and trivia are the only 
platforms on which our newscasts choose to compete, then we should all just 
face up to the fact that local news has become one of the worst daily soap 
operas -- something along the lines of "As the Stomach Churns."

 As a board member of Big Brothers of Los Angeles, I met with Beard and 
then-General Manager John Rohrbeck about the problem we were having recruiting 
enough qualified men as Big Brothers to the hundreds of needy boys on our 
waiting lists. The result of that meeting more than four years ago was a series 
of news inserts, "Friday's Pal," which the station produced and telecast weekly 
until Beard left for KTTV. 
</P>
<P>
 "Friday's Pal" was the best recruitment campaign Big Brothers ever had. It 
succeeded solely because Beard gave of his time and himself so generously.

 In the last year, the management at KNBC has made judgment calls that have 
deprived us of valuable reporters and reporting on consumerism, education and 
the environment, and now we're losing the guidance we used to get about movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Hoffman, KNBC-TV's news boss, seems to be responsible. Not only has he 
driven away top KNBC anchors (Beard and Linda Alvarez) but word is that his 
decisions are causing movie critic David Sheehan to want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC should at least try to salvage some of the well-liked, established local 
talent that Hoffman is driving away.

 REALLY EXCITED BY MANILOW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to Paul Grein's review "Could It Be Magic? Yes, If You're Barry 
Manilow" (Dec. 29), as I was the woman who was called up to the stage to sing 
"Can't Smile Without You" with Manilow, I feel compelled to respond to Grein's 
quotation of mine: 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, my answer to the question, "Do you know the words?" to "Can't Smile" was, 
indeed, "I did !" However, that was because I was excited and in total shock to 
be on stage with this talented, inspirational superstar Barry Manilow. I feared 
the words I knew so well might fly right out of my head; not that the song was 
so old I couldn't remember it, as Grein implied. 
</P>
<P>
 As a fan of Manilow, I would never insult or embarrass him. When he and I were 
singing together, he asked the audience to join in -- and they did, and that 
only proves that everyone knows the words to "Can't Smile."

WELLES' 'SHADOW' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Susan King's article about the forthcoming film version of the old radio 
serial "The Shadow" states that "Orson Welles was the seductive voice of the 
super-hero on the famed '40s radio series" ("Putting the Shadow in His Place," 
Jan. 6). 
</P>
<P>
 Welles was the radio voice of the Shadow in 1937 and 1938 and might have 
continued in that capacity if he hadn't done the 1938 "War of the Worlds" 
broadcast.He suddenly became too well known, and the powers-that-be at the 
network decided he could not continue as the Shadow.

 "The Shadow" debuted Aug. 1, 1930, and ran until Dec. 26, 1954. It was 
re-syndicated in the '60s and '70s and still can occasionally be heard on local 
radio.

ARMED FOR SELF-DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Had Polly Klaas grabbed a gun and shot her assailant dead, would Calendar have 
condemned her for not "sensibly hiding in her room," from where she would have 
otherwise been abducted by but one "unarmed burglar" who grabbed a kitchen 
knife? (" 'Armed' With a Message," Jan. 4). Would your writer take a 
sympathetic account of that much-happier story as his cue to blast her family 
as "gun-obsessed," "macho," "shallow" and "thick-headed"? Is Polly Klaas better 
dead than "warped"? 
</P>
<P>
 The consequences of exercising one's right to self-defense are, as evidenced 
by the CBS drama "Armed and Innocent," severe enough without the pious judgment 
of television critics. Call them "the psychological price of keeping guns in 
the home" if you must, but recognize the source: criminals who leave their 
victims no choice but self-defense. And note it's a price that might be 
"sensibly" preferred by those who won't be made to hide in their own homes, 
reward any felon who successfully breaks in with the right to decide their fate 
and ultimately pay the non-psychological but nevertheless real price of being 
dead.

TV REVIEWS; 'CARLIN' SHOWS SOME GLIMMER OF HOPE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 George Carlin waited all these years to star in a sitcom, and he still doesn't 
get to blurt the "Seven Words You Can't Say on Television." No, not even on 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 He does get to be a couple of those words, however, on "The George Carlin 
Show" (premiering Sunday at 9:30 p.m. on Channels 11 and 6), where he's utterly 
irascible, to use the civil terminology. His George O'Grady, an unencumbered 
New York cab driver, is broke, bitchy and practically invented the word 
misanthropy.  
</P>
<P>
 He has good reason to be cranky in the first episode -- having just lost his 
job because he won't cut his ponytail, having lost thousands of dollars he 
doesn't have to gambling debts, and having found a tiny dog that makes everyone 
who sees him walking it assume he's gay. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hope sucks," he tells the downtrodden waitress at his favorite beer bar, 
encouragingly. "People who have hope, they're constantly worried about when 
it's gonna kick in. They don't get to have a good time. On the other hand, a 
guy gives up hope, he's free to enjoy himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Will folks who tune in enjoy themselves? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there's hope. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was created by Sam Simon, who directed and co-wrote (with Carlin) the 
series opener, so it shouldn't come as any surprise when a fair amount of 
zingers approach home plate. Besides Carlin being a cab driver, recalling 
Simon's "Taxi" stint, he spends a lot of his down time as the cynical anchor of 
a working-class tavern populated by a dim bartender, a busty waitress, errant 
yuppies and a lot of other foils, not coincidentally bringing to mind "Cheers," 
another Simon alma mater. He knows his way around these comedic habitats, and 
the dialogue is properly tart. 
</P>
<P>
 If not quite properly heartfelt. Carlin makes for a very viable, potentially 
lovable loser, but he and Simon will need to flesh out a back story to 
rationalize the character's sourness if they're interested in establishing the 
distinction between curmudgeon and jerk, which is blurry in the premiere. CHRIS 
WILLMAN

TV REVIEWS; RANCOR AND VIOLENCE IN 'THE BEST OF FAMILIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON MATSUMOTO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "In the Best of Families: Marriage, Pride and Madness" (airing at 9 p.m. 
Sunday and Tuesday on CBS, Channels 2 and 8) is what you might call a 
no-brainer. Featuring a sensationalistic true-crime plot and a collection of 
skin-deep characters, it comes across like a four-hour dramatic version of 
"Hard Copy." 
</P>
<P>
 The overly long TV movie basically hinges on the combustive and ultimately 
violent behavior of Susie Sharp Newsom (Kelly McGillis), a comely Southern blue 
blood who plunges off the emotional deep end after her failed marriage to a 
dentist (Keith Carradine). 
</P>
<P>
 The rather tedious Part One gives the viewer a mostly exterior view of the 
couple's relationship as it moves from premarital bliss to post-wedding rancor. 
Susie's innumerable tantrums are more apt to set the eyes rolling in 
exasperation than to elicit significant alarm or sympathy. She seems less a 
fully realized character than a formidable bundle of hostility and neurotic 
mannerisms. 
</P>
<P>
 Part Two establishes a little momentum with a few bizarre plot developments. 
Susie begins a relationship with her deranged cousin Fritz, a paramilitary gun 
nut who ostensibly thinks he's running missions for the CIA. Suddenly, Susie's 
two young sons are being treated like grunts in the Marines rather than kids 
starving for love and comfort. Fritz is so far gone that he even dresses his 
little troop up in Army fatigues and has them ready to ingest cyanide in the 
event of "enemy" capture. 
</P>
<P>
 All of this leaves ex-husband Tom understandably desperate to gain legal 
custody of his sons. Unfortunately, his actions also serve to further rile the 
violent souls of Susie and Fritz. From here the pace of the movie quickens and, 
while as a character study it's still not "Crime and Punishment," "In the Best 
of Families" at least finishes with a pulse you can feel. JON MATSUMOTO

TV REVIEWS; DID U.S. CREATE TERROR MONSTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The very title of Peter Arnett's CNN report -- "Terror Nation? U.S. Creation?" 
(at 6 p.m. Sunday) -- suggests the Frankenstein syndrome that seems to dog so 
many of the political monsters created during the Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, one person's monster is another person's freedom fighter: Arnett's 
particular monster here is militant Islamic leader and Afghanistan Prime 
Minister Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, who may be viewed as the loosest of loose 
cannons, arming and training terrorists for assaults on the West and Western 
allies.His Muslim brothers, though, posit him as a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 It is this devotion, and the suicidal martyrdom that results from it, that 
makes Hekmatyar's alleged brand of terror so potentially dangerous. The first 
salvo in this war: the bombing of the World Trade Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnett, hardly a favorite of the U.S. defense Establishment since his 
spectacular Baghdad reports during the height of the Gulf War, will make no new 
friends with "Terror Nation?," which convincingly explains how the Trade Center 
bombers received their initial training, under CIA sponsorship, during the war 
to free Afghanistan of the invading Soviet army. 
</P>
<P>
 Arnett is remarkably free to explore Hekmatyar's network of Afghanistan 
terrorist training camps -- he even arranges a talk with Hekmatyar himself. 
</P>
<P>
 With cash derived from a resurgent drug trade through the Khyber Pass, and a 
huge U.S. and Soviet arms supply left behind by the war, Hekmatyar, Arnett 
reports, has been able to wage a two-pronged battle. First, he is embroiled in 
a civil war to oust Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani. Second, with his 
control of between 5,000 and 10,000 militants, Hekmatyar has been able to 
extend his fundamentalist jihad (or holy war) into India's Kashmir province, 
Egypt, Algeria and the Islamic-dominated southern provinces of the former 
Soviet Union. ROBERT KOEHLER

1993 REPORT WITHHELD INFORMATION ON EL TORO; CONVERSION: PORTION FAVORING BASE 
AS A COMMERCIAL AIRPORT WAS NOT RELEASED IN PUBLIC VERSION OF STUDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEBE MARTINEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As political tension mounted last summer between factions that either favored 
or opposed a commercial airport at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station, a 
regional planning agency suppressed parts of an FAA-funded study showing that 
El Toro had the greatest potential to succeed of three area military bases 
coming available for conversion. 
</P>
<P>
 "El Toro could be a very viable commercial airport in terms of serving demand, 
since it would attract about 4 million passengers per year, which is more than 
Burbank Airport currently serves," the study found after an extensive survey of 
airline passengers and booking agents, and weighing factors ranging from 
proximity to travelers' homes to potential parking fees. 
</P>
<P>
 "These results are not surprising since it has long been known that Orange 
County has the largest problem in the region in terms of having inadequate 
airport capacity to serve its own demand" -- a situation that obliges Orange 
County travelers to take flights from airports in Los Angeles and San 
Bernardino counties. 
</P>
<P>
 The study also found that "John Wayne (Airport) would be little affected," 
even if 40% of the flights from a new El Toro airport were so-called 
"long-haul" flights to cities more than two hours distance in a commercial jet. 
</P>
<P>
 While the existence of the study was an open secret last spring and some of 
its conclusions were generally known to Orange County officials involved in the 
debate over El Toro, the Southern California Assn. of Governments (SCAG) 
withheld the specific findings about the base from a version of its April, 
1993, report released to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 But the El Toro results were included in another version of the report -- also 
dated April, 1993, and identical in every other respect -- submitted to 
officials at John Wayne Airport. The report was recently obtained by The Times 
in response to a request under the California Public Records Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Pisano, the executive director of SCAG, acknowledged Friday that two 
versions of the base study indeed existed. He said the one that included El 
Toro had been supplied to the technical staffs of other local agencies months 
ago as a "work in progress" and he does not think the agency was obligated to 
share it with the public. He said an expanded version of the study is expected 
to be released in February or March. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1974, the California Supreme Court has held that "selective disclosure" 
of information by a public agency is unlawful, and that every citizen has the 
right to government information when an agency releases it to another party. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we cannot work together (with other agencies) as a technical team, I don't 
think that's a good process," Pisano said. He said he did not think that SCAG 
had actually run afoul of the selective disclosure ruling, because the report 
had not been transmitted in a manner he deems official. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaddi H. Vasquez, the current chairman of SCAG and an Orange County supervisor 
whose district borders the base, said Friday he did not think that SCAG 
officials had been playing politics in their handling of information about the 
Marine base's suitability as a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been very deliberate (as the chairman of SCAG) to ensure that the 
process runs its course in the way that SCAG would do any other analysis," said 
Vasquez, who has been in the thick of the debate over the base's future. 
Vasquez said he has never seen the El Toro report. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, however, Mike Armstrong, the SCAG project manager overseeing the 
study, told a gathering of airport officials that the El Toro results were in, 
but were being held up because the issue had become a political "hot potato." 
Added Armstrong: "What I can tell you right now is that El Toro does work 
pretty well" as a commercial airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Armstrong said SCAG officials were "waiting for the political dust to settle" 
before releasing the study's results to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was undertaken to help local governments decide whether closed or 
downsized military bases could be converted into commercial airports. A key 
objective was to see if the potential new airport sites were "close enough to 
urban population centers to serve the traveling public. . . . This is extremely 
important since many military bases are simply located too far away from 
population centers to serve them commercially." 
</P>
<P>
 When the first report was publicly released last April without findings on El 
Toro, SCAG officials said that part of the study had not been completed. The 
report that was released addressed the impact on existing regional airports, 
such as Orange County's John Wayne Airport, only in light of the possible 
closures or downsizing of Norton Air Force Base in San Bernardino County and 
March Air Force Base in Riverside County. 
</P>
<P>
 The bound copy of the report contained in John Wayne Airport files is 
virtually identical to the one publicly released, except that it includes the 
El Toro information along with three full-page charts that show passenger 
demand scenarios if El Toro were turned into a commercial aviation facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The report "really did not show anything that was not known before," executive 
director Pisano said, adding that he, too, had never laid eyes it. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors of the report's existence began circulating in political circles last 
spring, just as the battle was beginning over who would decide El Toro's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that the Orange County Board of Supervisors claimed sole authority 
to determine the future of the 4,700-acre base, only to have that claim 
challenged by South County cities that oppose its conversion to a commercial 
airport, fearing that an airport would bring more noise and congestion to their 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the report been released last summer, it probably would have placed county 
officials in the middle of a political firestorm, with South County city 
officials questioning the county's objectivity on the airport issue because of 
the county's influence at SCAG, and North County cities trumpeting the results 
in their fight for an airport. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials on both sides of the airport issue said Friday that if SCAG 
delayed releasing the report to avoid political flak, then it was mistaken. 
</P>
<P>
 Garden Grove Councilman Mark Leyes, who has been organizing the pro-airport 
movement in North County, said he did not think that release of the report last 
summer would have made any difference, and that the uproars in North and South 
County cities probably would have canceled one another out. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is troubling is that withholding that information about El Toro might 
not only skew the decisions on El Toro, but it might impact the decisions on 
Norton or even some of the other existing airports, and that would be 
unfortunate," Leyes said. "I would hope that that kind of information, prepared 
at public expense, would not be withheld from the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcia Rudolph, the mayor of Lake Forest, said SCAG has long favored the 
development of a commercial airport at El Toro, so the study's findings come as 
no surprise. "The thing I find amusing is that they would play games with when 
they were going to release the report, as though it were going to be some major 
thunderbolt of lightning or a surprise to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Vasquez also played down the shock value and the significance of the report, 
saying "whatever analysis is done in the end is not going to drive the 
(decision-making) process. There are many, many other considerations that need 
to be taken into account." 
</P>
<P>
 The report concluded: 
</P>
<P>
 * If Norton and El Toro were added to the airport system, with 80% of El 
Toro's service made up of short-haul flights and the balance consisting of 
long-haul service, it would attract about 4 million passengers a year -- 1 
million below the number of passengers who would use John Wayne. The airport 
would draw passengers from all of the airports, with most of the clients coming 
from Los Angeles, John Wayne and Ontario airports. 
</P>
<P>
 * If El Toro's short-haul flights were reduced to 60%, with 40% consisting of 
medium- and long-haul service, the number of annual passengers would increase 
to 5 million, almost equaling John Wayne. El Toro would become the 
third-busiest airport of the seven included in this scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 * If March, Norton and El Toro were added to the airport system, with El Toro 
offering mostly short-haul service, El Toro would have about 1 million fewer 
passengers than John Wayne, but would draw more business than Burbank, Long 
Beach, Norton and March. 
</P>
<P>
 The two airports with the fewest passengers, Norton and March, would be 
competing against each other, with March drawing travelers from Norton, the 
study concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the summer, SCAG analysts have expanded their study to update the 
current passenger demand figures and to forecast what the needs of air 
passengers will be in the year 2010. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the El Toro, March and Norton bases, the new report expected in 
February or March also will consider possible civilian use of the former George 
Air Force Base in San Bernardino County, and joint military and civilian 
operations at Point Mugu Naval Air Station in Ventura County.

AQMD MOVES RIDE-SHARING TO BACK SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving toward overhauling one of its most far-reaching and unpopular efforts 
to combat smog, the Southland's air quality board on Friday formed a task force 
to search for new ways to remove solo commuters from the region's roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the South Coast Air Quality Management District board was 
applauded by many businesses that have complained for years that they have 
unfairly had to shoulder the burden of trying to revolutionize the way Southern 
Californians commute. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to forming the task force, the board voted to allow businesses to 
delay implementing new ride-sharing incentives as long as they still meet their 
current goals. The agency's enforcement staff also was directed to issue 
warning notices -- instead of imposing fines -- when businesses do not fulfill 
ride-sharing requirements, unless the violations are "clearly flagrant." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the AQMD's ride-share rule adopted six years ago, companies in Orange, 
Los Angeles, Riverside and San Bernardino counties with more than 100 employees 
must establish programs that encourage employees to car-pool, take mass transit 
or use other means of getting to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Covering 5,200 companies with 1.3 million employees, the groundbreaking rule 
has been one of the AQMD's most ambitious efforts to fight smog. Its goal is to 
increase rush-hour ridership to an average of 1.5 people per car. To comply, 
companies must subsidize train and bus tickets for employees, form van pools 
and offer free parking or other incentives to car-poolers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule has been unpopular because thousands of offices and other 
non-industrial businesses must spend large amounts of money to create elaborate 
ride-share plans. Collectively, employers in the four-county area spend about 
$160 million a year on the programs, according to one recent study done for the 
AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD's effort to revamp its program will be monitored nationally because 
dozens of other smoggy cities have begun to model ride-sharing regulations on 
Southern California's. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD Board Chairman Henry W. Wedaa, a Yorba Linda councilman who spearheaded 
the effort to review the regulation, said the new task force will face the 
challenge of coming up with less costly and onerous ways to persuade commuters 
to leave their cars at home.  
</P>
<P>
 Members of the task force will be appointed by the AQMD board. Its size and 
makeup has yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 But a number of ideas for revamping the program have surfaced. Among them is 
setting auto registration fees according to the number of miles driven, or 
charging motorists for driving during peak traffic hours. Such efforts, 
however, would require new state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa stressed that the AQMD cannot abandon or weaken the program because 
state and federal laws require the agency to remove a large number of cars from 
Southland roads by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not scaling it back. I am not a supporter of that," said Wedaa. "But I 
am a supporter of supplying more options to obtain the same goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Before voting unanimously for the task force, several board members advocated 
rescinding the ride-share regulation completely. Its strongest critic on the 
board is Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich, who called it an 
excessive case of "Big Brother" government imposing its will on private 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're regulating the wrong people," agreed Stephen Albright, an AQMD board 
member who was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson. "We're regulating the employer, 
who has no authority to force the employee (to ride-share)." 
</P>
<P>
 Other board members, however, hailed the regulation as an efficient and 
relatively inexpensive way to reduce smog, compared with other, harsher 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we going to substitute instead? What is the cost to society . . . if 
we scrap this program entirely?" asked AQMD board member and Los Angeles City 
Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa said the task force "can't just throw rocks, you have to come up with 
solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Harriett M. Wieder, an Orange County supervisor, said she did not 
"want the task force to be an excuse for studying it to death and going back to 
business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Although AQMD staff members acknowledge that the ride-share rule is unwieldy 
and time-consuming for businesses, they say it has been one of the most 
effective methods of reducing smog-causing emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The average number of riders per car has increased to 1.24 from 1.13 when the 
program was adopted in 1987, according to the AQMD. During that time, the 
agency estimates that 11 million one-way trips per year have been eliminated in 
the four counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics among business leaders and government officials have condemned it 
as a costly attempt at social engineering that is bound to fail because so many 
Southland residents depend on their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have found it very difficult to sell alternative modes to our employees 
when the cost of fuel is so low and the available alternatives to the 
drive-alone mode are so few," said Bill Gemmill, a transportation manager at 
Continental Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Gemmill said Continental spends $300,000 annually on a ride-share program for 
its 4,000 employees in the Los Angeles Basin, and has raised its ridership 
average to 1.3 people per car from 1.05 a few years ago. But it is still short 
of the required 1.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Others on Friday urged the board to leave the ride-share requirements intact. 
The rule "is not a failure. (It) does work," said Bruce Roberts, the city of 
Los Angeles' ride-share program administrator.

WORN WHEELS CAUSE DELAYS ON RED LINE 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<P>
 Train wheels on Los Angeles' year-old subway have worn out up to 20 times 
faster than designed, and problems related to the deterioration forced transit 
officials late this week to cut by two-thirds the number of trains in service. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Thursday, passengers have had to wait more than twice as long for trains 
during peak hours, and the trains are traveling at greatly reduced speeds. 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority officials said the disruptions in service 
are expected to continue through the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The delays began Thursday morning after a machine recently purchased by the 
MTA to lubricate the rails dumped too much grease onto tracks leading southwest 
from Union Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The lubrication is intended to protect against derailment and extend the life 
of the wheels, which records show have been wearing out much more quickly than 
designed since the 4.4-mile Red Line opened last January. 
</P>
<P>
 During the disruptions this week, the MTA has removed from service 20 of its 
30-car fleet for the subway, MTA spokesman Bill Heard said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the entire southwest-bound track, from Union Station to MacArthur 
Park, was shut down while workers attempted to remove the excess grease. On 
Friday, the track was reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 The diminished fleet and reduced train speeds have caused longer waits for 
passengers and crowding. Some passengers rushing from Downtown late Thursday to 
catch above-ground Metrolink commuter trains at Union Station said they missed 
their connections. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got all the way down into the station at Civic Center and finally a 
(transit) cop said: 'You'll have to catch a bus to Union Station.' I couldn't 
figure out what was happening and no one seemed to know," said Russell Mun, a 
Municipal Court employee. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of six-minute intervals during peak hours and maximum 10-minute waits 
at other hours, the trains have been arriving at stations every 15 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Line trains traveling Friday between the Metro Center station at 7th and 
Flower streets and Union Station were observed operating at maximum speeds of 
22 m.p.h. instead of the usual 37 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 MTA spokesman Heard said normal passenger service is to be restored Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The service disruption is the most recent fallout from the excessive wheel 
wear, an issue brought to the attention of transit officials last spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The MTA has since hired two consulting firms to determine why wheels designed 
to last 250,000 miles often are worn out within 12,000 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also acknowledged that the premature wear could cause derailments. 
That is why the MTA in June ordered that the trains, capable of traveling 70 
m.p.h., be operated at slower speeds. Lubrication of the rails began more 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 One MTA official said that even with the lubrication, the wheels are 
continuing to wear prematurely. "The wear is very bad, and this affects the 
condition of the track," said the official, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
 A memo issued Friday by MTA operations chief Arthur T. Leahy said the 
lubricating machine was purchased in part because of the high number of workers 
needed to apply the grease-like substance by hand. 
</P>
<P>
 But for reasons unknown, Leahy said, the machine dumped too much grease onto 
the tracks. This interfered with the normal operation of the trains and caused 
the on-board computers to apply emergency brakes, damaging the surface of the 
wheels, he said.

PEACEMAKER AMONG GANGS IS CUT DOWN BY GUNFIRE; CRIME: TONY THOMAS HELPED FORGE 
TRUCE. HE WALKED FINE LINE BETWEEN HERO AND TARGET OF CULTURE HE TRIED TO 
REFORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Tony Thomas' transformation from gangbanger to peacemaker ended Thursday night 
when he was gunned down at the Imperial Courts housing project, an attack that 
has sparked anguished soul-searching about the future of the Watts truce and 
about the violent culture it has struggled to mend. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas, a 30-year-old veteran of the streets who walked with a limp from an 
earlier shooting, was one of the most celebrated architects of the movement to 
unite South-Central Los Angeles' black gangs. After the 1992 riots, he founded 
the nonprofit Hands Across Watts corporation, appeared on "Oprah" and is 
featured in an upcoming book about the history of the Bloods and Crips. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was like a real diplomat in the 'hood," said rapper Ice-T, who serves on 
the Hands Across Watts board of directors. "Ice-T might say, 'Stop,' but Ice-T 
makes records. When these brothers, like Tony, said 'Stop,' that means 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 But even as he gained stature, Thomas found himself walking a fine line. Some 
gang members resisted his nonviolent preaching. Others resented the notoriety 
he won. Sometimes, friends said, he packed a pistol for protection. Along with 
his trademark Georgetown cap, he also donned a bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you stand up against your homeboys, like Tony did, you face that 
danger," said T. Rodgers, a former Bloods leader who runs a consulting firm 
known as Sidewalk University. "Once you make that change in your life, you no 
longer believe in what they believe in. Your thinking has changed. And that's 
what's scary to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Details of Thomas' slaying remained sketchy Friday, despite three news 
conferences -- one a curt report from police detectives, the other an emotional 
farewell attended by grieving homeboys, and a final one at a Watts mosque in 
which activists sought to dispel what they termed false rumors that the truce 
was unraveling. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Los Angeles Police Department's South Bureau homicide detail, officials 
described the shooting only as an "act of gang violence" that also led to the 
wounding of Andre Wicker, 22, who was in critical condition with multiple 
gunshots at a hospital, and Rodney Compton, 20, who was treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were dozens of rounds shot that night," said Lt. Sergio Robleto, adding 
that Thomas got the worst of it, being hit "multiple times throughout his body 
-- from head to toe." 
</P>
<P>
 Officers were looking for eight to 10 potential witnesses, but no arrests had 
been made. 
</P>
<P>
 In a teary gathering at the Kedren Community Center in Watts, friends said 
Thomas had gone to the housing project to play dice because he needed money to 
pay the phone bill at the Hands Across Watts office, which has tried to 
translate the gang truce into increased economic empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 As he did almost every day, they said, Thomas also searched out a few of the 
younger PJ Crips, urging them to lay down their weapons and do something 
positive for the community. Although police could not confirm this account, 
Thomas reportedly made the mistake of lecturing several suspected drug dealers 
who apparently did not want his advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brother Tony did not approve of drug dealers," said a sobbing Malik Spellman, 
30, who worked with Thomas at Hands Across Watts. "He took a stand." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate interview, Becky Hammonds, Thomas' girlfriend of 14 years, said 
she believed he was "ambushed by some PJ Watts Crips who wasn't keen on the 
peace." She added that witnesses told her that Thomas was carrying a pistol and 
that he fired back at his assailants, possibly wounding two of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," she said. "All the wrong we done, then we start doing 
right, and this happens." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, Thomas had come to symbolize the truce's redemptive spirit, 
turning his life around after spending nearly nine years behind bars. Barbara 
Cottman Becnel, a writer who has interviewed him extensively for her upcoming 
book about the Crips and Bloods, said his death brought home just how difficult 
the transition was that Thomas had been attempting. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you and I decide that there's some little glitch in our psyche that we 
want to work on, it's usually a little, minor, internal project," she said. 
"Tony was making the kind of change that few of us ever demand of ourselves. He 
was this man of the streets, working with everything he had in him, with all of 
his heart, to claim a solid place in the legitimate world. It was very, very 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 She attributed the change in Thomas, widely known as Tony Bogard, or "TB," to 
two pivotal events that he frequently spoke of -- the death of his mother and 
his brush with mortality. 
</P>
<P>
 The first occurred in the 1980s, during one of his stays in County Jail, when 
he was unable to comfort his terminally ill mother. "That really hurt him," 
Becnel said. "He didn't want to keep living the kind of life that, when his 
mother was dying, he couldn't be there." 
</P>
<P>
 After his release, rivals shot him eight times with an AK-47, a nearly lethal 
attack that kept him disabled for almost two years and left several slugs 
lodged in his body. In what Becnel described as "a sort of deathbed epiphany," 
Thomas vowed to forever change his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "His deal with God was that: 'If I survive this situation, I'm going to do 
good,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 By most accounts, he worked feverishly to make good on his vow. Earning a 
small stipend from county Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke's office, he 
initiated a youth program that took hundreds of youngsters from the Watts 
projects to Dodger games, amusement parks and the beach. He helped secure a 
$200,000 grant for a job-training program launched last month for 150 young 
adults. In honor of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday, he had planned to hold a 
peace treaty picnic today at Imperial Courts. 
</P>
<P>
 "There might have been some who didn't agree with him, but he reached people," 
said Cynthia Mendenhall, president of the Imperial Courts residents council. 
"He took the time and explained to kids what he did, where he came from, why he 
walked with a limp. . . . Tony as a child grew up rough, and he wanted it 
better for these kids who's coming up now." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though he was candid about the challenge of undoing decades of violent 
rivalry, he also believed that the people of Watts -- steeped in the 
community's sense of history and identity -- had a special responsibility to 
lead the way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watts is showing all the other communities that we can get together, that 
we're all one," he told The Times in a 1992 interview. "But all we can do is be 
an example. You can't go out there and make nobody do what they don't want to 
do."

CLINTON HAS TV AUDIENCE IN THE BAG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CAREY GOLDBERG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton charmed a live studio audience of rapt Russians so 
thoroughly on Friday that one starry-eyed member considered wrapping her hand, 
which had just shaken his, in a Baggie to retain the sensation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked with him just as if he were a guy from my street," marveled Natasha 
Vysotskaya, a 36-year-old sociologist. "I should put my hand in a cellophane 
bag." 
</P>
<P>
 From Vyborg to Vladivostok, millions of viewers who tuned in to Russia's first 
direct, live address and Q&A session by a U.S. President were subjected to the 
full force of the down-home salesmanship he used to woo American voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton quoted Abraham Lincoln. He assured a 13-year-old Russian boy that with 
hard work and luck he, too, might grow up to be president. He praised the 
energy, education and rich heritage of Mother Russia and promised "a light at 
the end of this long tunnel." 
</P>
<P>
 He was so persuasive that he even won a round of applause for Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin, whose popularity lately is lukewarm at best, by 
pointing out that Russia is lucky to have "a president who's willing to wade 
into the tides of history and make decisions."  
</P>
<P>
 If the studio audience was any indication, Clinton's rating may well be higher 
now in Russia than at home.  
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the old Soviet days, when a lecture on democracy and economics from a 
U.S. President would have drawn bellows of outraged pride from Communist 
patriots, the Russians in Friday's audience -- largely university students -- 
took his preaching with equanimity. Several noted that he seemed to want to 
teach Russia how to run its affairs, but their comments held little rancor. 
</P>
<P>
 "His assessment of our situation, especially of the economy, is about right," 
said Viktor Mikheyev, a technician at the Ostankino television center where 
Clinton spoke. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a skillful politician," said Natasha Sokolova, a Moscow State University 
student. "No matter what the question was, he brought the answer around to 
friendship and democracy." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some queries from the audience carried an undertone of the humiliation 
of lost power that has helped spur Russia's new wave of ultranationalism. 
</P>
<P>
 One questioner implied that Clinton was trying to prescribe a single, 
American-style recipe for Russian democracy and that Americans tend to say, " 
'Come on, comrades, be just like us.' And isn't that incorrect?" 
</P>
<P>
 The strongest applause came when a Russian teacher asked why school exchange 
programs all seemed to bring Russian children to America but not vice versa, 
and Clinton acknowledged that they should be more two-sided and that American 
children could learn much here. 
</P>
<P>
 One Russian broadcaster appeared miffed that so many people in the audience -- 
which had been meant to consist of typical Russians -- knew English. He 
wondered on the air if a hall of nearly 400 Russian-speakers could be gathered 
in America. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton, obviously aware of the pitfalls awaiting him, tried openly to avoid 
them; he asserted repeatedly that the United States was not trying to dominate 
Russia, saying, "I want to have an equal partnership here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to have any dictatorial control in Russia," he maintained, 
repeatedly referring to the United States and Russia as partners. 
</P>
<P>
 But sometimes even his attempted compliments appeared to backfire; he sounded 
like a teacher encouraging a lazy pupil when he told Russians, "It is clear 
that you have the capability to do well." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton sounded pedantic as well as he described almost in outline form his 
vision of Russia's three main challenges now: developing a free-market economy, 
strengthening democracy and learning to redefine itself as a great power 
without expanding its borders. 
</P>
<P>
 He moved from teaching Poli. Sci. 101 to Econ. 101 when he explained to 
Russians intimately acquainted with rampant inflation and its causes that the 
government must cut its spending if it wants to slow the price spiral. 
</P>
<P>
 He was facing a much tougher forum than the campaign-trail town meetings he 
set up to sell Americans on his candidacy and such issues as the North American 
Free Trade Agreement. Even the large part of the audience that spoke English 
did not respond to most of his light jokes, and only a faint laugh greeted his 
comically understated retort to Russian extremists' demand that America return 
Alaska: "I don't think I can go along with that." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor were there any grateful murmurings when he promised to deliver on pledges 
of American aid and praised Russia's past as "a history of heroism." 
</P>
<P>
 When Clinton said that he believes the greatest difference between Russia and 
the United States is that Russia is one of the world's youngest democracies 
while America is one of its oldest, one Russian cameraman muttered: "Great. Now 
we have a big brother." 
</P>
<P>
 One woman called Clinton on not having praised Russia's great spiritual energy 
-- he remedied that immediately -- and a man pressed him on continuing to give 
aid to Baltic countries where the Russian minorities say they are treated as 
second-class citizens. Clinton said he was awaiting a report from Latvia and 
that its conclusion on whether Russians' rights were violated there would 
affect U.S. policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, the audience was a gentle one, as hospitable Russian 
audiences tend to be to foreigners. Warm smiles lit many faces at the show's 
best moment, when a 13-year-old Russian boy who had seen a photo of Clinton as 
a teen-ager shaking hands with President John F. Kennedy asked when his 
presidential ambitions had begun to take root. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come shake hands with me, and maybe you'll be president of Russia some day," 
Clinton told him. 
</P>
<P>
 And he did.

COLUMN ONE; BOYS ONLY: SEPARATE BUT EQUAL?; DOES PLACING BLACK YOUTHS IN THEIR 
OWN CLASSES HELP THEM DO BETTER? SOME PUBLIC SCHOOL EDUCATORS THINK SO AND ARE 
RUNNING MAVERICK PROGRAMS THAT OTHERS CALL ILLEGAL OR A CIVIL RIGHTS RETREAT. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Michael Hunt is a roly-poly fifth-grader who wants to become a minister -- or 
maybe a singer. He suddenly has found himself at the center of a bitterly 
controversial educational and social experiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael is enrolled at an all-black inner-city elementary school where the 
principal and teachers have decided that their pupils may learn better if 
segregated by sex. 
</P>
<P>
 The school is one of at least two dozen throughout the country, mostly in 
heavily African American districts in the East, that in the past five years 
have been quietly skirting the law by separating boys from girls. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice, now something of a grass-roots movement, is aimed at improving 
the academic performance of black boys, who in many districts have lower 
achievement and higher dropout rates than other groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents believe -- more from gut feeling than hard proof -- that all-male 
classes might help provide boys with black, male role models and an education 
more tailored to their needs. 
</P>
<P>
 But federal education officials say the classes are illegal. And civil 
libertarians, feminists and some prominent black educators say they represent a 
retreat from equality and a return to the discredited notion of "separate but 
equal." 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, research on the benefits of single-gender education is 
inconclusive at best, experts say. If such programs help anyone, they say, it 
is girls, not boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Though support for boys-only classes does not divide along racial lines, the 
debate has placed largely white organizations such as the American Civil 
Liberties Union and the NOW Legal Defense and Education Fund in the awkward 
position of opposing black educators and parents on what is best for their 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ultimate question is who's going to determine what's in the best 
interests of African American children," said Jawanza Kunjufu, a well-known 
black writer who has advocated all-boys schools and other radical educational 
reforms.  
</P>
<P>
 "The ACLU and the NOW organization think they can decide that," said Kunjufu, 
president of African-American Images, a consulting company in Chicago. "I think 
black parents need to make that decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Some say they should decide against single-gender schooling. "They're doing 
the wrong thing for the right reasons," said Hugh J. Scott, the first black 
superintendent of the Washington, D.C., school system who now is dean of 
education programs at Hunter College in New York. "What these students need, 
and the heart of the problem, is good teachers," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest experiment in single-gender classes is in Baltimore, where boys 
and girls attend separate classes in more than a dozen schools, and where 
district administrators not only know about the practice but, for now, support 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 The most elaborate example is the Robert W. Coleman Elementary School, 
crouched on a wind-swept promontory in the crumbling neighborhood of Coppin 
Hill, where crack cocaine became such a scourge a few years back that a grand 
jury visited the school to see how the children were holding up. 
</P>
<P>
 At Coleman, Principal Addie Johnson started the first all-male class four 
years ago after learning that certain boys were falling behind. Now, almost all 
classes are single-gender. Girls and boys mix for music class and meals and on 
the playground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been doing reading about how boys learn differently from girls," 
Johnson recalled recently, referring to controversial theories that boys have 
shorter attention spans and are more energetic and physical. "I thought, let's 
test this. . . . We did it kind of quietly." 
</P>
<P>
 In Rochester, N.Y., Principal Anita Boggs took a similar approach five years 
ago at the Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. School -- a large elementary school whose 
student body is 97% minority and mostly low-income, evenly divided between 
blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was extremely upsetting to me to look at my fresh-faced, exuberant, happy 
children and know that 10 years from now, they might be dead," she said in an 
interview. "I could see that they were hungry for a significant male role model 
in their lives, for something to be proud of." 
</P>
<P>
 So when two teachers asked Boggs whether they should move more girls into a 
boy-heavy second-grade class, Boggs suggested they just move the girls out. To 
teach the boys, she assigned a young male teacher who was born in Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be frank with you, I kept a real low profile," said Boggs, who ran the 
single-gender classes for four years until the district and state stopped the 
practice and transferred her to another school. 
</P>
<P>
 In Philadelphia, where a lawsuit forced the city a decade ago to admit girls 
to Central High School, the principal of Robert Fulton Elementary School, in a 
lower-income, racially mixed neighborhood, has set up a second-grade class this 
year for boys only. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, I guess it's against the law. But I wasn't trying to break the law," 
said Principal Dietra Spence, who organized the class at a teacher's request. 
"I'm sure once this gets out, someone will come and disband it." 
</P>
<P>
 Some districts have toyed with the idea but decided against it for fear of 
litigation. They have turned instead to "heritage immersion" programs that 
emphasize the accomplishments of African Americans. The Savannah-Chatham 
County, Ga., district is beginning such a program this month because its 
lawyers advised against boys-only classes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit district, which is 89% African American, has opened three 
so-called African-centered schools. The ACLU and the NOW Legal Defense and 
Education Fund had sued in 1991 and blocked plans for all-male academies. 
</P>
<P>
 The heritage immersion programs also were conceived to help African American 
boys, whose rates of suspension, absenteeism and delinquency were the highest 
in those school systems. In some districts, administrators say the boys have 
the lowest course-passage rate and are the most likely to be held back a grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts disagree on the reasons behind such statistics. But some black 
theorists believe they stem in part from a clash between the male culture of 
young black boys and what some describe as the female-dominated culture the 
boys encounter at home and in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunjufu, whose controversial writings inspired Johnson, has found that boys' 
test scores begin to drop during the third and fourth grades. He believes the 
heavily female ranks of elementary schoolteachers have failed to accommodate 
what he describes as black male learning styles -- a notion that is vigorously 
disputed by some feminists, among others. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers have measured boys against female standards of behavior, Kunjufu 
argues, faulting them for their failure to be quiet and eager to please. 
Naturally energetic, boys have wrongly been labeled hyperactive and forced into 
special education classes in disproportionate numbers, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunjufu, who is best known for a three-volume work called "Countering the 
Conspiracy to Destroy Black Boys," wants mandatory training for teachers, 
especially white women, in what he describes as black, male learning styles -- 
their shorter attention spans, higher energy levels, competitiveness and 
stronger motor skills. He would also like curricula modified. 
</P>
<P>
 Those views are partially shared by Spencer Holland, an educational 
psychologist at Morgan State University in Baltimore and another prime advocate 
of boys-only classes. He and others say these programs may be needed only to 
get through the crucial elementary school years. 
</P>
<P>
 Holland believes that African American boys who grow up in households headed 
by women develop attitudes toward girls and women that inhibit learning. For 
example, they may refuse to imitate a female teacher, when imitation and 
modeling are crucial to elementary school learning. 
</P>
<P>
 So in the late 1980s, Holland began advocating single-gender classes -- taught 
by men who understand "boy behavior" from personal experience. "It caused a 
furor," he recalled recently. "I was accused of sexism: 'You can't do this in 
public school! Where's the research?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The research, as it turns out, is not clear-cut and does not explicitly 
examine the merits of special schooling for black boys. Studies of the 
single-gender education are few, relatively recent and plagued by 
methodological questions. What's more, they have focused on secular private 
academies and Catholic schools. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the best-known researchers is Valerie Lee, an associate professor of 
education at the University of Michigan. Lee found some favorable effects of 
single-gender Catholic schools, mostly in girls; she found few positive, and 
some negative, effects of single-gender, independent schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at girls Catholic schools seemed to have higher educational 
aspirations and achievement, and less tendency to engage in sexual 
stereotyping. But in private boys schools, Lee found examples of girls and 
women being treated as sex objects. 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly different conclusions were reached by Cornelius Riordan, a professor 
of sociology at Providence College in Rhode Island, who has found that female 
and minority students do better in single-gender Catholic schools, while white 
boys do better in coeducational schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Although single-gender schools are not necessarily more effective than others, 
they tend to have certain positive attributes, Riordan said. Those include a 
greater degree of order, a "pro-academic culture," and fewer anti-intellectual 
values. 
</P>
<P>
 They also offer more successful "same-sex role models" among the students, 
Riordan said, and greater leadership opportunities. If there are indeed gender 
differences in learning, as some people argue, Riordan said single-gender 
schools might cater to those differences. 
</P>
<P>
 On the issue of legality, a report released last month by the U.S. Department 
of Education stated that federally funded, single-gender classrooms are illegal 
under Title IX, which prohibits discrimination on the basis of sex in federally 
subsidized school programs. The only exceptions are classes in human sexuality 
and contact sports, and classes for pregnant girls, on grounds of privacy or 
safety. 
</P>
<P>
 As for single-sex schools, the report said they are allowed only if comparable 
schools exist for both genders. But Norma V. Cantu, assistant secretary for 
civil rights, said in an interview that the education department is 
reconsidering that policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantu attributed any rise in interest in single-gender schooling to "the lack 
of enforcement of the civil rights laws." As soon as the government comes out 
clearly against "certain types of groupings, then you'll see administrators 
cease to experiment," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others see a worrisome philosophical shift behind the interest in boys-only 
classes and single-race schools -- as well as in girls science and math 
classes, such as those offered at Ventura High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Included among those critics are such prominent black intellectuals as Kenneth 
B. Clark, a key figure in persuading the U.S. Supreme Court to rule that 
"separate but equal" schools violate the Constitution. Clark has argued that 
the ruling should apply no less to gender than to race. 
</P>
<P>
 Some sense a growing preoccupation with the differences, rather than 
similarities, between races and between genders, and a loss of enthusiasm for 
the traditional liberal ideal of integration as the route to equality. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think a lot of people committed to integration have been so disappointed 
for so long that when the new medicine man comes to town and has a new bromide 
in the bottle, people are in such pain they'll try anything," said Norman 
Siegel, executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, critics fear that single-gender classes reinforce ideas 
about gender differences -- for example, that the opposite sex is a distraction 
and that boys cannot learn with girls. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, a group of 10- and 11-year-olds at Baltimore's Coleman 
school talked animatedly about the advantages and drawbacks of single-gender 
classes. Both boys and girls agreed that they found it easier to concentrate 
and that they had learned something about self-respect and self-control, in 
part because they felt more comfortable airing personal issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators said test scores and achievement levels have also improved 
significantly. They were also struck by how much the girls seemed to flourish 
and how many more were now taking math. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents, too, are pleased with the experiment. Boys and girls both "are able 
to focus on the correct kind of competition," said Sidney Matthews, a Baltimore 
father who teaches at Coleman and whose daughter is in an all-girls class 
there. Matthews said boys no longer fear appearing to be "sissies" and girls do 
not hesitate to use their intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 In Rochester, too, attendance improved, suspensions dropped and achievement 
levels rose, according to Boggs. 
</P>
<P>
 After four years, the principal says, state and district officials 
discontinued the classes. A lawyer for the district said they were stopped as 
soon as the district learned of them. The lawyer said Boggs' subsequent 
transfer had nothing to do with the single-gender classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, Boggs still believes single-gender classes should exist as an 
option. 
</P>
<P>
 In Baltimore, fifth-grader Michael Hunt agrees. He says life at his school is 
more harmonious. Parents have become more involved in the school -- and no 
longer simply to gripe about fights among their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "From what I see the parents are not coming up that much (to complain)," he 
said. "They're coming up to help."

COURTHOUSE IS CLUBHOUSE FOR THE MENENDEZ WATCHERS; TRIAL: SYMPATHIZERS OR 
SKEPTICS, THEY SUSPEND EVERYDAY LIVES AND GATHER DAILY TO FOLLOW THE FATE OF 
THE BROTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They've been called groupies, fanatics, voyeurs. "People think we're just 
these nutty girls who want to have sex with Erik and Lyle," says one, shaking 
her head. 
</P>
<P>
 They've been sneered at by smug reporters, derided as gullible, pathetic 
hangers-on. But the Menendez-watchers, an informal, predominantly female club 
that meets most mornings at the Van Nuys Courthouse, hold their heads high. 
</P>
<P>
 "We," says one woman proudly, "have heard more than the jury." 
</P>
<P>
 Every high-profile trial has its looky-loos, especially if the charge is 
murder. The Night Stalker drew a standing-room-only crowd. So did the Hillside 
Strangler. And now the trial in the killings of Jose and Kitty Menendez by 
their sons have lured an unusual group to the drab courthouse hallways, all 
hoping for a seat in the courtroom or at least a glimpse of the action. 
</P>
<P>
 One regular, who called herself simply Theresa, was in the original pool for 
the Lyle Menendez jury, was excused and just kept coming back. Another, Sherman 
Oaks makeup artist Joan Villarreal, says her own experience as a battered wife 
made her come to the courthouse after the Menendezes alleged that they had been 
sexually abused by their parents. She has rarely missed a day since. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Spreckels, a Beverly Hills native who once helped Elvis Presley answer 
his fan mail, has become the case's unofficial historian, compiling news 
clippings in two indexed binders that have come to be known around the 
courthouse as "the bibles." Several reporters have purchased copies -- for $85 
or more -- to use as reference material. 
</P>
<P>
 Gender is one thing that sets these observers apart. Hard-core court-watchers 
usually tend to be men, often retirees, who hop from trial to trial like repeat 
offenders. But these loyal Menendez-watchers -- some of whom have competed for 
as few as six available courtroom seats every day for months -- are mostly 
women who had never been to a trial before. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something different about this case, they say -- something that has 
made it worth their while to take time out from school, work and children to 
bear witness to the brothers from Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Dominick Dunne, who is covering the trial for Vanity Fair magazine, has a 
theory about what it might be: "The fact that the defendants are young, 
handsome and used to be rich has a certain appeal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's vulnerability. The defense attorneys' portrayals of "the 
boys" as victims have clearly struck a chord among some of the trial-watchers. 
One elderly woman wanted to bring them homemade chicken soup. Several others, 
like a 38-year-old businesswoman who regularly commutes three hours from San 
Diego, have sent some of the thousands of letters of support received by the 
brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lyle Menendez's testimony changed my life. . . . And I do have a life," the 
San Diegan said Friday as she waited to hear if Lyle Menendez's jury would 
reach any conclusions. Like some of the regulars, she was reluctant to give her 
name for fear of being "exploited." 
</P>
<P>
 But she had no hesitation relating that, when the brothers described being 
tormented by their parents, she heard the ring of truth. "I believe in them and 
I wanted to stand alongside them," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 To Marybeth, a Valencia mother who put her two young children in day-care for 
the first time in order to attend the closing days of the trial, the belief in 
the brothers is a leap of faith. And she thinks it's no accident that more 
women seem to make that leap than men -- who find it easier, she says, to 
dismiss the brothers' accounts as self-serving lies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not wanting to be made a fool of, that's an issue for men more than women," 
she said. "If you open your heart and allow (the brothers') emotions to come 
in, and then you find out they're lying, you would feel like a sucker. . . . 
You can't ever trust yourself again." 
</P>
<P>
 Marybeth believes the brothers' dramatic account precisely because some parts 
of it are so incredible. "I looked at it closely (asking myself) 'Is that real 
emotion? Is that something you could make up in jail?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Her conclusion: "They didn't want their parents to die. They just wanted to 
live." 
</P>
<P>
 But not everybody in the courthouse crowd buys the brothers' story. 
</P>
<P>
 Villarreal, the makeup artist whose own experiences with abuse impelled her to 
court, says she greeted the testimony of Lyle and Erik Menendez with an open 
mind. The more she's heard, however, the less she's been able to swallow. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lyle? His testimony was Laurence Olivier," said Villarreal, 48. "I think it's 
a bunch of b.s." 
</P>
<P>
 Villarreal wanted first-degree murder convictions for both brothers and 
considers the mistrial in Erik's case a "travesty." She makes no attempt to 
disguise her contempt for the court-watchers who express pity for Erik Menendez 
-- and it is he, she points out, not his older brother, who has attracted the 
bigger following. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody is really interested in poor Lyle," she said. "The fan club in all 
this is going to Erik because Erik is more pathetic. He can't cope. He's been 
deprived. That's what (his supporters) say. Honey, it's the twilight zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Villarreal sets herself apart from the pro-defense observers, 
Spreckels -- the unofficial case historian -- tries to keep a polite distance 
from all other spectators. Spreckels, 62, is a veteran court-watcher -- she has 
been attending Los Angeles-area trials off and on for 46 years. Procedure, not 
personalities, is what keeps her coming back, she says. And it is a point of 
pride with her that she will not align herself with one side or the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never discuss the outcome," Spreckels said. "I like the courtroom 
atmosphere, the discipline, the points of law, the brilliance of people coming 
up with the better lie and telling it often enough to be believed." 
</P>
<P>
 For all their differences of opinion, the Menendez-watchers share much in 
common. All refer to the lawyers in the case strictly by their first names -- 
as in "Leslie (Abramson, Erik Menendez's attorney) threw a fit." 
</P>
<P>
 When court is not in session, they can be found in the second-floor cafeteria, 
staking out window seats in order to keep their eyes on the action outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's one of our jurors," they can be heard to say, nodding toward a man or 
woman they've sighted at the main entrance below. To pass the time, they argue 
points of law, tossing around terms such as "honest but unreasonable belief" 
and "implied malice," often continuing debates conducted among the lawyers and 
the judge without the jury present. 
</P>
<P>
 At times, they have been joined by tourists and day-trippers. One young man 
from Texas stopped by when he was in Los Angeles visiting colleges he hopes to 
attend. A group of flight attendants on a stopover from Washington, D.C., stuck 
their heads in as well. 
</P>
<P>
 But only the faithful kept coming, on exciting days and dull ones. Whether it 
is scholarly interest, romantic fantasy or eagerness for attention that pulls 
at them, they dutifully place their purses on the conveyor belt, walk through 
the metal detector and stake out a spot in line. Maybe today, they'll see a bit 
of history. Maybe today, some of them say, their presence will do some good. 
</P>
<P>
 They speak of it as an obligation -- one that is likely to demand their 
presence when Erik Menendez is tried again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once I commit," Spreckels said, " . . . I don't miss anything."

3RD MAN JAILED IN ATTACK ON SKATER KERRIGAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The man suspected of carrying out the attack on Olympic figure skater Nancy 
Kerrigan surrendered Friday to authorities in Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Shane Minoaka Stant, 22, of Chandler, Ariz., was charged with conspiracy to 
commit assault in the second degree and unlawful flight to avoid prosecution. 
Authorities allege the attack on Kerrigan was arranged by the bodyguard of 
figure skating champion Tonya Harding, one of Kerrigan's rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Stant surrendered in Phoenix and was being held in the Maricopa County Jail. 
He is the third person arrested so far in the attack, joining Shawn Eric 
Eckardt, 26, and Derrick Brian Smith, 29, who were arraigned Friday in 
Portland, Ore., and entered pleas of not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair were arrested in Portland Thursday night and charged with conspiracy 
to commit assault. Eckardt is Harding's bodyguard. Bail for Eckardt and Smith 
was set at $20,000 each. Eckardt posted bail Friday night and was released. 
</P>
<P>
 Stant did not enter a plea in an appearance before a U.S. magistrate in 
Phoenix on Friday. He was appointed a public defender and ordered detained 
until a Wednesday hearing on extradition to Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile on Friday, Harding and her ex-husband, Jeff Gillooly, who have 
reconciled since their Aug. 28 divorce, were seen leaving their home outside 
Portland together, but they did not respond to questions from reporters. 
Harding later met with two attorneys, Robert Weaver and Chris Kovack. 
</P>
<P>
 According to an affidavit filed by the FBI, Stant conspired with others during 
a meeting in Portland in late December to injure Kerrigan in an attempt to 
prevent her from competing in last week's U.S. Figure Skating Championships, 
which served as the Olympic trials, then flew to Detroit to commit the assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Kerrigan was struck on the right knee by a baton-wielding assailant shortly 
after a practice session on Jan. 6, the day before the championships, which 
Harding won. 
</P>
<P>
 An FBI spokesman called Stant "a paramilitary sort of guy who is familiar with 
weapons." 
</P>
<P>
 The 24-year-old Kerrigan, who was waived onto the Olympic team by the U.S. 
Figure Skating Assn. even though she was forced to withdraw from the national 
championships, said Friday that she plans to return to practice at her Cape 
Cod, Mass., training rink within a few days and expects to be fit for the 
Olympics. The women's competition begins in Lillehammer, Norway, on Feb. 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm assuming I can do the program of my life," said Kerrigan, a bronze 
medalist in the 1992 Games. "It's up to the judges, not me. I'm really just 
focusing on my skating." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the swelling in her right knee, even Kerrigan seemed to be having 
difficulty grasping the reality of the situation after learning that the three 
men arrested since Thursday have a connection to Harding, her U.S. Olympic 
teammate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't understand any explanation of why something like this would occur," 
Kerrigan said at a news conference Friday outside her Stoneham, Mass., home. "I 
don't think I could ever understand the answer because I can't think that 
viciously." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how she will react to competing in the Winter Olympics with Harding, 
Kerrigan said: "I have nothing to say to her." 
</P>
<P>
 Harding, however, has not been charged in the attack, and, although NBC News 
reported Friday night that she is under "active criminal investigation," 
authorities denied that she is a suspect at this point. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are investigating everything," said John Bradley, deputy district attorney 
for Multnomah County, Ore. "So, I mean, we are going to be as complete as we 
can. Whatever you make of that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Detroit Free Press also quoted unnamed law enforcement officials as saying 
Harding was under investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver, Harding's attorney, said Friday night that Harding was cooperating 
with the district attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do know that there are no charges outstanding," Weaver said. "That was 
confirmed to me an hour ago in a meeting I had in the district attorney's 
office. This continuous reporting by some people that there are charges 
outstanding needs to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is quite exhausted by all of this. While she will be making a statement, 
she's not prepared to do that today." 
</P>
<P>
 Multnomah County Dist. Atty. Michael Schrunk would not disclose the roles 
believed to have been played by the three men in custody, but Fox News 
identified Smith as the driver of his nephew Stant's getaway car.  
</P>
<P>
 Schrunk also would not say whether other arrest warrants would be filed. 
</P>
<P>
 According to NBC News, Eckardt has accused Harding of being involved in the 
"planning and cover-up" of the attack on Kerrigan. The Detroit Free Press 
reported that Eckardt, in an attempt to gather evidence that also would 
implicate Gillooly, planned to tape-record a meeting between the two earlier 
this week, but Gillooly did not show. 
</P>
<P>
 A Portland private investigator, Gary Crowe, said that he heard a recording of 
Gillooly and Eckardt planning the attack in an earlier conversation, but that 
tape has not been located. Also, an unidentified woman told Detroit police that 
she heard a recording a few months ago of a conversation involving four people 
who were discussing a possible assault on Kerrigan. The names of the four men 
were reported to the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless Harding, 23, is implicated in the attack, she will not be asked to 
relinquish her berth in the Olympics, U.S. Olympic Committee and U.S. Figure 
Skating Assn. officials said. She earned the berth by winning the national 
championship last Saturday night.

CLINTON AND YELTSIN END SUMMIT WITH NEW UNITY, PACTS; RUSSIA: THE TWO LEADERS 
SIGN ARMS, ECONOMIC ACCORDS. THEY ALSO AGREE ON A SERIES OF STEPS DESIGNED TO 
HELP MOSCOW STAY ON THE ROAD TO A FREE-MARKET ECONOMY.

<P>
 President Clinton and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin concluded their 
two-day Moscow summit with a blizzard of new agreements on economic and 
security issues Friday, cementing what aides described as a new, more realistic 
relationship between the United States and Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 In solemn Kremlin ceremonies, the two leaders, joined by Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk, signed an accord to remove all nuclear weapons from Ukraine 
and agreed to stop aiming long-range missiles at any of the world's countries. 
</P>
<P>
 And Washington and Moscow reached agreement on a series of steps designed to 
help Russia continue its progress toward a free-market economy while cushioning 
the impact of change on ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin, in the only significant public disagreement with Clinton in two days 
of determinedly positive exchanges, sharply rejected the admission of East 
European countries to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization -- unless Russia 
joins at the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Yeltsin deftly turned his endorsement of Clinton's "Partnership for 
Peace" into a formula for forestalling NATO membership for individual countries 
such as Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. The beauty of the American 
plan, he said, was that it provides for taking none of the European states into 
the alliance until they are admitted en masse, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That is not the way Washington sees the partnership at all, but Clinton and 
other Administration officials let Yeltsin's assertion pass without direct 
challenge. Who joins NATO and when is a question to be answered down the road, 
they made clear; what matters now are concrete steps to deal with the problems 
immediately at hand. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome, Russian and American officials said, reflected a significant 
evolution in the relationship, a step beyond both the terrors of the Cold War 
and the starry-eyed illusions of the first years of peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, we had the romantic phase," said Russian scholar Alexander Konovalev, 
an expert on East-West relations. "Now this is becoming a normal working 
relationship between two countries." 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes are still high. The United States desperately wants Yeltsin's 
economic and political reforms to succeed, U.S. officials note, because behind 
the Russian president stands the threat of aggressive nationalism in the form 
of neo-fascist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 But the negotiations are much easier now. "When we were adversaries, we had to 
negotiate every understanding line by line," said a senior U.S. diplomat with 
long experience in Moscow. "Clinton and Yeltsin are willing to give each other 
the benefit of the doubt." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Foreign Minister Georgy Mamedov called the meeting "the most 
substantive, businesslike and concrete" of any he had attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton agreed to meet with Yeltsin again in July, when the two will attend 
the annual economic summit of big industrial powers in Naples, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 And he invited Yeltsin to make a state visit to Washington this fall, making 
three meetings in the span of one year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing a lot of business," a senior U.S. official said. 
</P>
<P>
 That was confirmed by the long list of agreements finalized in a flurry of 
signing ceremonies. They included: 
</P>
<P>
 * A new joint effort to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. Clinton and 
Yeltsin pledged to take "energetic measures" to block the spread of nuclear 
weapons, and they called on North Korea to comply with international demands to 
open its nuclear facilities for inspection. 
</P>
<P>
 * Common concerns on human rights. The leaders issued a statement saying 
"aggressive nationalism and political extremism are the main threat to peace 
and democracy" and pledged to combat human rights violations, including 
anti-Semitism and xenophobia. 
</P>
<P>
 * A $100-million investment fund to help turn large Russian state firms into 
private enterprises. Clinton appointed Michael Blumenthal, former Treasury 
secretary in the Jimmy Carter Administration, to chair the so-called Fund for 
Large Enterprises in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the Overseas Private Investment Corp. announced three protocols 
supporting U.S. private investment projects in Russia, including plans to 
modernize telecommunications systems, restart idle oil wells and boost crude 
oil production. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Yeltsin discussed at length a social welfare system that would 
help Russians make the transition to a free market system with less pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made it perfectly clear to the President that we would expand the scope of 
reforms, focusing more on the social dimension," Yeltsin said. "I am confident 
that this country will have greater stability and durable social peace." 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the leaders disagreed, it reflected the overall improvement of their 
relationship, Russian and American officials said: The two countries can now 
argue candidly over individual issues without threatening each other with dire 
consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin was characteristically blunt at the summit's final news conference 
when asked whether he agrees with Clinton's policy of holding out possible NATO 
membership to some former Soviet Bloc countries in Eastern Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Admitting us one by one is no good," Yeltsin said. "I am against that." 
</P>
<P>
 He said NATO should invite Russia and all other East European countries to 
join the alliance at the same time -- an approach NATO leaders rejected at 
their summit meeting in Brussels this week. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials shrugged off the dispute, saying it would not get in the way of 
other dealings with Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 The President made a determined public show of support for his Russian 
"partner," as he repeatedly dubbed Yeltsin, talking up his reforms and 
expressing respect for Russia's greatness both in official public meetings and 
in events designed to reach out to average Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 He paid his respects to the war dead at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, 
attended a formal Kremlin dinner and accepted an invitation from Yeltsin to 
stay overnight in a guest apartment inside one of the Kremlin palaces. And he 
led Russia's first live TV "town hall," modeled on the campaign events that 
became Clinton's political trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 Hillary Rodham Clinton and daughter Chelsea arrived in a snowstorm to join the 
President on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton visited the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier at 8 a.m., looking still tired 
from the previous night's three-hour dinner at Yeltsin's dacha.  
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and a party that included Secretary of State Warren Christopher and 
Russian Foreign Minister Andrei V. Kozyrev followed three goose-stepping 
soldiers, who carried a wreath to the black-and-red granite tomb, which is next 
to the Kremlin wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton stood with bowed head before the memorial, which contains the remains 
of soldiers who died in what Russians call "the Great Fatherland War" of 1941 
to 1945. It is inscribed: "Your name is unknown but your deed is eternal." 
</P>
<P>
 Such visits are part of the standard rituals of summitry, but this visit 
carried an added message to the Russian people, the White House hopes: Clinton 
respects both the enormous suffering that has marked their history and the 
greatness of their role in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Both presidents hailed their agreements on nuclear weaponry as a significant 
step toward security from nuclear attack. Most important, they said, was the 
three-nation agreement to remove nuclear weapons from Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether Kravchuk can keep his end of the bargain remains in doubt. Kravchuk 
has agreed to remove the weapons several times since 1992, only to run into 
stiff resistance from Ukraine's Parliament, the Rada. This week, after the new 
agreement was announced, some leading members of the Rada denounced it, and 
almost all said the Parliament would insist on debating the pact. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement on missile targeting, Russia and the United States will 
alter the guidance data for their long-range missiles so that by May 30 the 
weapons are not trained on any country. 
</P>
<P>
 Most U.S. missiles will simply be left without target data, but the aging 
Minuteman III system, which requires targeting, will be aimed at remote areas 
in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike most arms control agreements, this one does not include any procedure 
for verifying that it has been carried out -- because that would be virtually 
impossible, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 And, they noted, either side could restore targeting data to its missiles in a 
matter of minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the agreement is not merely symbolic, they said. Removing the targeting 
data from long-range missiles means that in the event of an accidental launch 
of Russian missiles, New York, Washington and Los Angeles would no longer be 
among the likely landing points. 
</P>
<P>
 In their human rights declaration, the two presidents denounced "aggressive 
nationalism . . . xenophobia and anti-Semitism." U.S. officials said they 
believe it is the first time Russia has specifically condemned anti-Semitism in 
a diplomatic statement. 
</P>
<P>
 But human rights also figured in the two presidents' disagreements. Yeltsin 
complained about the treatment of ethnic Russians in the Baltic republics of 
Latvia and Estonia, where Russia still has an estimated 20,000 troops, saying, 
"There should be no double standard, whether it happens in Haiti or the 
Baltics." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton has already pressed the leaders of Latvia and Estonia to treat ethnic 
Russians fairly, but he is also pressing the Russians to withdraw their troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The two sides also disagreed over their policies toward Iran, where Russia 
wants to continue selling weapons. And they disagreed over Russia's military 
peacekeeping operations in neighboring Georgia and other former Soviet 
republics. 
</P>
<P>
 But the disagreements did little to spoil an overall mood of satisfaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have certain disagreements between ourselves," Yeltsin told reporters. "We 
do not agree with each other on everything. But the main thing is that we have 
goodwill and partnership." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Richard Boudreaux contributed to this report. An Array of 
Accords 
</P>
<P>
 Steps announced Friday by President Clinton and Russian President Boris N. 
Yeltsin at a joint news conference: REDIRECTING MISSILES 
</P>
<P>
 A declaration signed by the two said that by May 30, no country will be 
targeted by the missiles of either the United States or Russia. "For the first 
time since the earliest days of the nuclear age, the two countries will no 
longer operate nuclear forces, day-to-day, in a manner that presumes they are 
enemies." Three of the four U.S. strategic missile systems -- Trident I, 
Trident II and Peacekeeper -- will contain no targeting information. 
Older-technology Minuteman III missile computers, which require alignment, will 
be aimed at oceans. NUCLEAR WEAPONS 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Yeltsin signed a three-way agreement with Ukrainian President 
Leonid Kravchuk under which Ukraine pledged to transfer all the nuclear 
warheads it inherited from the Soviet Union to Russia for dismantling "in the 
shortest possible time." The 46 SS-24 missiles in Ukraine, the most potent 
weapons, would be deactivated within 10 months. The agreement still faces 
opposition in Ukraine's Parliament. NON-PROLIFERATION 
</P>
<P>
 The two issued a joint statement listing goals and priorities on efforts to 
discourage the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and to control 
sensitive dual-use technologies. They called on North Korea to honor the treaty 
requiring inspection of its nuclear facilities and urged India and Pakistan to 
join in treaties to ban nuclear-weapons tests. HUMAN RIGHTS 
</P>
<P>
 A joint statement said respect for basic human rights is "indispensable for 
the maintenance of good relations between countries." It pledged joint efforts 
to combat human rights violations, including anti-Semitism and xenophobia. The 
statement answered concerns about ultranationalism in Russia and discrimination 
against Russian-speaking people in other former Soviet republics. URANIUM 
</P>
<P>
 Under a contract signed in Moscow, Russia will convert 500 tons of highly 
enriched uranium extracted from dismantled nuclear weapons into low-enriched 
uranium that can be used for nuclear power plants. The uranium then will be 
sold to the United States Enrichment Corp., which will use the material to 
supply nuclear power stations around the world. Over the 20-year life of the 
contract, Russia will earn about $12 billion at no net cost to the U.S. 
government. Ukraine, Kazakhstan and Belarus get compensation for the value of 
the uranium in warheads they transfer to Russia.

AGENCY TO SEEK NEW WAYS TO FIGHT SMOG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving toward overhauling one of its most far-reaching and unpopular efforts 
to combat smog, the Southland's air quality board on Friday formed a task force 
to search for new ways to remove solo commuters from the region's roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the South Coast Air Quality Management District board was 
applauded by many businesses that have complained for years of unfairly 
shouldering the burden of trying to revolutionize the way Southern Californians 
commute. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to forming the task force, the board voted to allow businesses to 
delay implementing new ride-sharing incentives as long as they still meet their 
current goals. The agency's enforcement staff also was directed to issue 
warning notices -- instead of imposing fines -- when businesses do not fulfill 
ride-sharing requirements unless the violations are "clearly flagrant." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the AQMD's ride-share rule adopted six years ago, companies in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties with more than 100 
employees must establish programs that encourage employees to car-pool, take 
mass transit or use other alternative means of getting to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Encompassing 5,200 companies with 1.3 million employees, the rule has been one 
of the AQMD's most ambitious and groundbreaking efforts to fight smog. Its 
target is to increase rush-hour ridership to an average of 1 1/2 people per 
car. To comply, companies must subsidize train and bus tickets for employees, 
form van pools and offer free parking or other incentives to car-poolers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule has been unpopular because thousands of offices and other 
non-industrial businesses must spend large amounts of money to create elaborate 
ride-share plans. Collectively, employers in the four-county area spend about 
$160 million a year on the programs, according to one recent study done for the 
AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD's effort to revamp its program will be monitored nationally because 
dozens of other smoggy cities have begun to model ride-sharing regulations 
after Southern California's. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD Board Chairman Henry W. Wedaa, who spearheaded the effort to review the 
regulation, said the new task force will face the challenge of coming up with 
less costly and onerous ways to persuade commuters to leave their cars at home. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the task force will be appointed by the AQMD board. The size and 
makeup has yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 But a number of ideas to revamp the program already have surfaced. Among them 
is setting auto registration fees according to the number of miles driven, or 
charging motorists for driving during peak traffic hours. Such efforts, 
however, would require new state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa stressed that the AQMD cannot abandon or weaken the program because 
state and federal laws require the agency to remove a large amount of cars from 
Southland roads by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not scaling it back. I am not a supporter of that," said Wedaa, a 
Yorba Linda city councilman. "But I am a supporter of supplying more options to 
obtain the same goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Before voting unanimously for the task force, several board members advocated 
rescinding the ride-share regulation completely. Its most voracious critic on 
the board is Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich, who called it an 
excessive case of "Big Brother" government imposing its will on private 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're regulating the wrong people," agreed Stephen Albright, an AQMD board 
member who was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson. "We're regulating the employer, 
who has no authority to force the employee (to car-pool)." 
</P>
<P>
 Other board members, however, hailed the regulation as an efficient and 
relatively inexpensive way to clean up smog, compared with other, harsher 
options. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we going to substitute instead? What is the cost to society . . . if 
we scrap this program entirely?" said AQMD board member and Los Angeles City 
Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa said the task force "can't just throw rocks, you have to come up with 
solutions."  
</P>
<P>
 Board member Harriett M. Wieder, an Orange County supervisor, said she did not 
"want the task force to be an excuse for studying it to death and going back to 
business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Although AQMD staff members acknowledge that the ride-share rule is unwieldy 
and time-consuming for businesses, they contend it has been one of its most 
effective efforts in reducing smog-causing emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of average riders per car has increased to 1.24 from 1.13 when the 
program was adopted in 1987, according to the AQMD. During that time, the 
agency estimates that 11 million one-way trips have been eliminated per year in 
the four counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics among business leaders and government officials have condemned it 
as a costly attempt at social engineering that is bound to fail because so many 
Southland residents depend on their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have found it very difficult to sell alternative modes to our employees 
when the cost of fuel is so low and the available alternatives to the 
drive-alone mode are so few," said Bill Gemmill, a transportation manager at 
Continental Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Gemmill said Continental spends $300,000 annually on a ride-share program for 
its 4,000 employees in the Los Angeles basin, but has raised its ridership 
average to 1.3 people per car. That is more than its average of 1.05 a few 
years ago, but still far short of the required 1.5.

VETERAN OF GANGS' WAR AND PEACE DIES BY GUNFIRE; VIOLENCE: TONY THOMAS IS 
KILLED BY SUSPECTED DRUG DEALERS. HE MAY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO COUNSEL THEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Tony Thomas' conversion from gangbanger to peacemaker ended Thursday when he 
was killed by suspected drug dealers whom he apparently had been trying to 
counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 His journey had never been an easy one. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas was a 30-year-old veteran of the PJ Watts Crips His mother died while 
he was locked away in County Jail. After his release, rivals shot him eight 
times with an AK-47, a nearly fatal attack that left him with a limp and 
several bullets still lodged in his body. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after he helped forge the highly publicized truce on the eve of the 1992 
riots -- emerging as one of South-Central Los Angeles' most celebrated 
peacemakers -- Thomas continued to walk a fine line. He co-founded the 
nonprofit Hands Across Watts corporation and Oprah Winfrey invited him on her 
talk show. But on the streets he was challenging a violent culture that had 
been decades in the making. Friends said he rarely left the house without a 
bulletproof vest. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you stand up against your homeboys, like Tony did, you face that 
danger," said T. Rodgers, a former Bloods leader who runs a consulting firm 
known as Sidewalk University. "Once you make that change in your life, you no 
longer believe in what they believe in. Your thinking has changed. And that's 
what's scary to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Details of Thomas' slaying remained sketchy Friday, despite two news 
conferences -- one a curt appearance by Los Angeles Police Department 
officials, the other an emotional farewell attended by ex-gang leaders, rapper 
Ice-T and the Nation of Islam's top West Coast representative. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Chief Mark A. Kroeker, commander of the LAPD's South Bureau, said only 
that Thomas was involved in a confrontation at the Imperial Courts housing 
project Thursday night that "erupted in gunfire that took his life." He 
described the shooting as an "act of gang violence," but added that detectives 
did not know whether Thomas was targeted or if drugs were involved. No arrests 
had been made. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Sergio Robleto, commander of the bureau's homicide detail, said the gun 
battle also resulted in injuries to Andre Wicker, 22, who was in critical 
condition Friday with multiple gunshots, and Rodney Compton, 20, who was 
treated and released. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were dozens of rounds shot that night," Robleto said, adding that 
Thomas was hit "multiple times throughout his body -- from head to toe." 
</P>
<P>
 In a teary gathering at the Kendren Community Center in Watts, friends said 
that Thomas, widely known as Tony Bogard, had gone to the housing project to 
play dice in hopes of earning enough money to pay a phone bill at the nearby 
Hands Across Watts office. As he did almost every day, they said, he also 
sought out a few of the younger members of his former gang, urging them to lay 
down their weapons and do something positive for the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police could not confirm this account, Thomas reportedly lectured 
several suspected drug dealers who apparently did not want his advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brother Tony did not approve of drug dealers," said Malik Spellman, 30, who 
worked closely with Thomas at Hands Across Watts. "He took a stand." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Carl Washington, a truce negotiator who serves as a deputy to County 
Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke, said he could not understand why "such a 
little, minute situation" had cost Thomas his life. "The only thing we can tell 
you today is that our brother paid the price," Washington said. "He died for a 
just cause." 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate interview, Becky Hammonds, Thomas' girlfriend of 14 years, said 
she believed he was "ambushed by some PJ Watts Crips who wasn't keen on the 
peace." She added that witnesses told her that Thomas was carrying a pistol and 
that he fired back at his assailants, possibly wounding two of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe it," she said. "All the wrong we done, then we start doing 
right, and this happens." 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday afternoon, the bullet shells and the blood stains had been washed 
away from the spot on the 2200 block of East 114th Street where Thomas had lain 
dying less than 24 hours before. There was no memorial, no sign of mourners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never seen it this quiet," said Cynthia Mendenhall, president of the 
Imperial Courts residents council. "Nobody is talking about what they think 
happened or who they think did it." 
</P>
<P>
 The killing signaled a troubling turn for the truce movement and Hands Across 
Watts, whose other co-founder, Tyrone (Ty-Stick) Baker, has been held on 
weapons charges for the past several months by federal authorities in Kansas 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization had planned to hold a peace treaty picnic todayat Imperial 
Courts in honor of Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday and had recently received 
a $200,000 job training grant that Thomas was helping to implement at the 
housing project, said Patrick Mulligan, former executive director of Hands 
Across Watts and a consultant for the corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some respects, the truce has been decapitated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ice-T, who serves on the organization's board of directors, also expressed 
concern about the loss of Thomas' nonviolent message. "He was like a real 
diplomat in the 'hood," the rapper said. "Ice-T might say, 'Stop,' but Ice-T 
makes records. When these brothers, like Tony, said, 'Stop,' that means 
something." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite those concerns, truce leaders and other community activists made a 
point Friday of emphasizing that Thomas had not died in vain. Others would rise 
to the occasion, they said, picking up where he left off. "Tony gave his life 
for what he believed in," ex-gang leader Rodgers said. "There will be 10 that 
will take his place." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas had been working with writer Barbara Cottman Becnel, who is featuring 
him as a central character in a book she is writing about the history of the 
Bloods and Crips to be published this fall by Macmillan Books. She said Friday 
that his death brought home just how difficult the transition was that Thomas 
had been making in his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you and I decide that there's some little glitch in our psyche that we 
want to work on, it's usually a little, minor, internal project," she said. 
"Tony was making the kind of change that few of us ever demand of ourselves. He 
was this man of the streets, working with everything he had in him, with all of 
his heart, to claim a solid place in the legitimate world. It was very, very 
hard." 
</P>
<P>
 She attributed his reformation as a hardened gangster who spent nearly nine 
years behind bars to two pivotal events that he frequently spoke of -- the 
death of his mother and his brush with death. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really loved his mother," Becnel said. "He didn't want to keep living the 
kind of life that, when his mother was dying, he couldn't be there. That really 
hurt him." 
</P>
<P>
 Later, when Thomas was riddled with semiautomatic gunfire in front of his 
house on Jan. 17, 1991, there was little hope he would survive. Becnel said he 
had "a sort of death-bed epiphany." 
</P>
<P>
 "He made some real decisions about the rest of his life," she said. "His deal 
with God was that, 'If I survive this situation, I'm going to do good.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But after the truce, he again was struck by tragedy. Last February, his sister 
was killed by a bullet that ripped through her apartment window while she 
cooked in her kitchen at Imperial Courts.

BOBBITT TESTIFIES ABOUT MUTILATION OF HER HUSBAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sobbing uncontrollably, Lorena Bobbitt told a hushed and tense courtroom 
Friday that she cut off her husband's penis with a carving knife because she 
could no longer endure the rape, beatings and other abuse to which she said she 
was subjected during their four-year marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the fourth day of her trial on a charge of malicious wounding, the 
prosecution sought to discredit Mrs. Bobbitt's story during cross-examination 
by pointing out several contradictions between her latest testimony and the 
story she told both before and during the earlier trial of her husband, John 
Wayne Bobbitt, on charges of sexual assault. 
</P>
<P>
 As the cross-examination began, Assistant Commonwealth Atty. Mary Grace 
O'Brien zeroed in on Mrs. Bobbitt's contention that she could not remember 
actually cutting off her sleeping husband's penis after he allegedly raped her 
following a night of bar-hopping with a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien noted that Mrs. Bobbitt had described the actual mutilation in 
previous statements and she indicated that a prosecution witness will testify 
that Mrs. Bobbitt once threatened to cut off her husband's penis if she ever 
learned that he was having an affair. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecution also asked Mrs. Bobbitt about a history of theft -- noting she 
had embezzled $7,200 from the beauty parlor where she worked as a manicurist 
and once shoplifted a department store dress. The line of questioning appeared 
designed to portray Mrs. Bobbitt as a dishonest, disturbed and vengeful woman 
who became insanely jealous after learning that her husband indeed was having 
affairs with several women. 
</P>
<P>
 Relying mostly on testimony from about a dozen witnesses who said that they 
saw Bobbitt abuse his wife on numerous occasions, the defense has tried to 
portray Mrs. Bobbitt as a classic example of a battered wife who should not be 
held responsible for a desperate act committed in a moment of extreme emotional 
distress. 
</P>
<P>
 As the sensational trial that has both fascinated and horrified the nation 
nears a conclusion, with a verdict expected sometime next week, it was clear 
that Lorena Bobbitt's fate would depend on which portrait -- battered spouse or 
vengeful woman -- the jury of seven women and five men finds more believable. 
If convicted, the 24-year-old Ecuadorian-born manicurist faces up to 20 years' 
imprisonment and deportation to Venezuela, where she grew up. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bobbitt, a 26-year-old bar bouncer and former Marine, has steadfastly 
denied his wife's accusations of abuse. He was acquitted of marital assault 
charges in the same courtroom in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Nervously clutching the small gold crucifix that she has worn around her neck 
throughout the trial, Mrs. Bobbitt took the stand Friday for the second day. 
She testified that near the end of their first year of marriage her husband 
pressured her into having an abortion, threatening to leave her if she refused 
and saying that "the baby would be ugly and I would be a terrible mother." 
</P>
<P>
 Testifying again about the physical abuse that she has said he visited upon 
her, Mrs. Bobbitt said that her husband was fascinated by "karate guy movies" 
and would sometimes practice the moves on her, kicking her in the stomach, 
karate-style, whenever their arguments turned violent. 
</P>
<P>
 "He thought he was Jean Claude Van Damme," she said in a soft voice, referring 
to the Belgian-born martial arts actor. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was at the point where she began relating her version of the events 
that led to the mutilation on the morning of June 23 that Mrs. Bobbitt lost the 
composure she clearly had been struggling to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Awakened by the sound of a door slamming about 3 a.m., Mrs. Bobbitt said that 
she heard her husband and a house guest return home to their small Manassas 
apartment 30 miles from Washington after a night of drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 She went back to sleep, she said, but awoke again to find her husband "on top 
of me" pinning her arms to her side and pulling down her underclothes with his 
foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "His chest was on top of me. I couldn't breathe. I said: 'What are you doing?' 
He wouldn't say anything. I said I don't want to have sex. He wouldn't let me 
go. . . . I tried to keep my legs closed. I tried to keep my underwear on but I 
couldn't. . . . Hurt, he hurt me, he was hurting me," she sobbed 
uncontrollably. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Bobbitt said that when her husband had finished with her, she went into 
the kitchen to get a glass of water from the refrigerator. Standing there in 
the dim light cast by the open refrigerator door, she said that she saw the 
carving knife lying by the sink. She picked it up, she said, and stared at it 
while memories of past abuse raced through her head. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remembered many things," she said in a quavering voice. "I remembered the 
first time he raped me. I remembered the insults. . . . I remembered the first 
time he forced me to have anal sex (and) the bad things he said. I remember the 
abortion. I remember everything," she shuddered in her broken English. 
</P>
<P>
 She remembered nothing after that, Mrs. Bobbitt said, until she was driving 
her car to the home of a friend. Looking down, she saw with horror that her 
husband's severed penis was in her left hand. She said that she immediately 
threw it out of the car window into a field, where police subsequently found 
it. It was later reattached in a nine-hour operation. 
</P>
<P>
 During her cross-examination, O'Brien questioned Mrs. Bobbitt's memory lapse 
by noting that she had previously recalled returning to the bedroom, pulling 
back the sheets and looking at her husband before using the knife. 
</P>
<P>
 She also questioned Mrs. Bobbitt about several other conflicting statements in 
her most recent testimony. Referring to a rebuttal witness who has not yet been 
called, she asked the defendant whether she had ever threatened to mutilate her 
husband for having an extramarital affair. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Bobbitt denied making a threat. But she broke into tears once more when 
she was asked about her history of theft. She said that she felt "ashamed" of 
her actions but was "desperate" because her husband was frequently out of work 
and took money from her, leaving her without enough to pay bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial is scheduled to continue on Tuesday with testimony by psychiatrists 
who have examined Mrs. Bobbitt.

NIGERIAN CAMPAIGNS FOR A PRESIDENCY HE ALREADY WON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chief Moshood Abiola, wearing his finely pressed white robes, raced around 
this teeming city in an armed convoy the other night, kissing the bride at a 
wedding reception, pressing the flesh at cocktail parties and chatting 
privately with the British ambassador. 
</P>
<P>
 After an hour's sleep, the chief was up for Muslim prayers, and by midmorning 
he was leading 2,000 Christians in Bible songs. 
</P>
<P>
 A politician on the hustings? Not exactly. The bearish, 56-year-old 
multimillionaire businessman won a democratic election for president of Nigeria 
-- seven months ago. And the army is still in charge. 
</P>
<P>
 As Abiola's campaign for the office he has already won suggests, Nigeria's 
experiment with democracy has left Africa's most populous nation reeling. Since 
Nigerians elected Abiola in a free and fair election last June, the country has 
endured one puppet civilian government and two military governments. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, eight long years after military rulers promised a return to civilian rule 
in Nigeria, the hopes for democracy treasured by so many here seem as distant 
as ever. And the nation, though still producing 2 million barrels of oil a day, 
has been virtually bankrupted by unchecked corruption and dictatorial 
mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so unfortunate how things have turned out," said Beko Ransome-Kuti, 53, 
a chain-smoking physician who heads the Campaign for Democracy, the country's 
leading liberal coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Nigerian head of state is Gen. Sani Abacha, who seized power about 
nine weeks ago amid angry street protests that many feared had brought Nigeria 
to the brink of civil war. In the time-honored tradition of Nigerian dictators, 
Abacha has promised to oversee a new transition to democracy, beginning with a 
national conference to write a new constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, as the trek toward civilian rule begins anew, the country is mired in its 
deepest economic depression since the free-spending oil boom of the 1970s. 
Despite its still-substantial oil reserves, unemployment stands at 50%, 
inflation is running at 65% a year, the country owes $33 billion to foreign 
lenders, and the middle class that once thrived here has disappeared, leaving 
only the very rich and the very poor. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are hoping to be surprised by this regime," Ransome-Kuti said. "But I have 
my doubts. In Nigeria, it is always the man who has eaten who tells the hungry 
man to be patient." 
</P>
<P>
 The patience of Nigerians has been tested since June 12, when 15 million 
voters went to the polls for the election long promised by the military ruler, 
Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. 
</P>
<P>
 The general had done his best to stage-manage the process. He created two 
political parties, one slightly right of center and one slightly left. He wrote 
their platforms. He even selected their candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 But it seems clear now that he never really intended to hand over power. 
</P>
<P>
 Abiola was elected with a solid national majority that successfully bridged 
the traditional differences among Nigeria's 250 ethnic groups. And Babangida 
promptly annulled the results. 
</P>
<P>
 Pro-democracy riots broke out in July, leaving 168 Nigerians dead. And when 
Babangida finally agreed to leave in August, he handed power to a feeble, 
unelected interim government headed by Ernest Shonekan and backed by Abacha, 
Babangida's longtime deputy. 
</P>
<P>
 Shonekan's efforts to heal the deep economic wounds, without benefit of a 
democratic mandate, only hastened the country's slide. When he removed the 
government subsidy on gasoline, sending prices at the pump rising from the 
equivalent of 6 U.S. cents a gallon to 45 cents, he was confronted with strikes 
and demonstrations in the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 When Abacha informed Shonekan that junior military officers planned a coup, 
the relieved leader promptly submitted his resignation, calling his interim 
government "a child of circumstance." 
</P>
<P>
 Abacha took over Nov. 17. He banned "processions, political meetings and 
associations of any kind," which defused the immediate civil crisis. He 
dissolved the National Assembly, dismissed the elected state governors and 
abolished the two political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 In private chats with foreign envoys, he promised to stage a constitutional 
conference to lay a "solid foundation" for democracy; he even sought their 
advice on the way forward. 
</P>
<P>
 In the streets of Lagos, a city of 8 million people, and across the country of 
95 million, there was more relief and resignation than anger. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't mean we like this Abacha regime," said Samuel Madu, 32, who works 
for a car service company in Lagos. "We are fed up with these military regimes. 
But people were afraid of war." 
</P>
<P>
 In his brief tenure, Abacha already has managed to divide his political 
opposition. His most surprising accomplishment was to co-opt several key 
opponents of military rule into his Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Olu Onagoruwa, a respected civil rights lawyer, accepted a job as Abacha's 
attorney general. He now argues that the general's promise of a constitutional 
conference was what the pro-democracy forces had been seeking all along. 
</P>
<P>
 Abiola's vice president-elect took a job as the new foreign minister, and the 
publisher of a newspaper critical of the government also accepted a portfolio, 
as internal affairs minister. In a bid to distance himself from the past, 
Abacha "retired" 17 military officers closely associated with Babangida's 
discredited regime. 
</P>
<P>
 "This administration has shown that it is action-oriented," said Jerry Gana, 
Abacha's information minister. "Nigerians admire that." 
</P>
<P>
 The central question now is whether Abacha is serious about democracy or, as 
his detractors contend, merely using his own promises of democracy to stay in 
power as long as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure, but it is a question that has divided Abacha's 
opponents and left Abiola suspended between an election he won and an 
inauguration he demands. 
</P>
<P>
 After more than a month of silence, Abiola announced in December that he would 
cling to the results of the June 12 election and hope that Abacha will have 
"the wisdom," as he puts it, to hand over power peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 "They want to kill my mandate, but they are wasting their time," Abiola said 
in an interview. "All the man (Abacha) wants is to be president and stay there. 
I can assure you, my mandate is alive and well and will never die." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps. But other pro-democracy leaders say Abiola's chance has come and 
gone. They contend that the popular leader lacked the nerve to form his own 
government and fight the military rulers last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Abiola is finished," said Olisas Agbakoba, a lawyer and chairman of the Civil 
Liberties Organization in Lagos. 
</P>
<P>
 Gani Fawehinmi, a widely respected civil rights campaigner in Lagos, added: 
"He went to sleep with the mandate. People were prepared to die for him, and he 
didn't show enough courage." 
</P>
<P>
 Abiola's answer: "I'm a politician, not a guerrilla leader." 
</P>
<P>
 Some Nigerians were also worried by Abiola's meetings with Abacha, shown on 
state-run television in the days after the coup. 
</P>
<P>
 Wole Soyinka, the Nigerian author and human rights campaigner, said he found 
it "shocking and disappointing." Soyinka, the 1986 winner of the Nobel Prize 
for literature, has called on foreign governments to "not say or do anything to 
give hope to this regime." 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought I had sold out," said Abiola, who acknowledges meeting four 
times with Abacha. "But I didn't sell out. To kiss somebody, you have to get 
near them. But to bite them, you have to get near him too." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Abiola's grass-roots support still appears strong. Being a Muslim but 
also a Yoruba, he bridges the historic gulf between the Muslims of the north 
and the Yoruba and mostly Christian ethnic groups in the south. 
</P>
<P>
 His substantial wealth, amassed in private enterprise, is respected. 
</P>
<P>
 He owns a publishing house, a large farm and an oil company; he has 
international connections, having spent 16 years as a vice president of the 
U.S. corporation ITT. 
</P>
<P>
 Many here believe that those personal riches would make him immune to any 
temptation to steal from the treasury. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every major Western government has demanded that Nigeria recognize 
Abiola's victory, and many Nigerians would also like to see him given a chance 
to run the country. 
</P>
<P>
 At the recent church service in Lagos, Abiola was greeted by a standing 
ovation. The pastor, the Rev. Chris Okotie, a former pop music star in Nigeria, 
said Abiola "has come to symbolize the principles of democracy in our land." 
</P>
<P>
 On the clogged streets of Lagos, Abiola's motorcade, complete with his own 
private security service, is frequently stopped by cheering, waving crowds of 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Abacha has shown no inclination to give the keys to Abiola. 
</P>
<P>
 "June 12 was a watershed for democracy," said Gana, Abacha's information 
minister. "We have learned many lessons. But we are not likely to go back." 
</P>
<P>
 While some pro-democracy leaders are heartened by Abacha's promise of a 
constitutional conference, others are not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can ill-afford another journey to no destination," said Fawehinmi, who has 
been jailed 18 times by military regimes. "It's not necessary. It is a 
buying-time strategy by the military." 
</P>
<P>
 But Onagoruwa, the new attorney general and Fawehinmi's good friend, thinks 
Abacha is sincere. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not fools," he said. "If the government does not show any seriousness 
in the constitutional talks, I will get out." 
</P>
<P>
 It is still not clear how much power Abacha will be willing to surrender to 
constitutional negotiators, some of whom will be elected and others appointed. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has already suggested that certain topics, such as whether 
Nigeria should remain a unified country, will be off limits. 
</P>
<P>
 Gana promises that decisions "will be deeply respected and implemented." But 
he characterizes the decisions as "recommendations," suggesting that Abacha 
will still have the final say. 
</P>
<P>
 Although foreign governments denounced Abacha's coup, most diplomats in 
Nigeria now have decided to wait and see what the general does. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their moves so far have been positive," one Western ambassador said. "But 
power sometimes becomes a heady thing." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton recently announced that the U.S. government will deny visas 
to members of Nigeria's military government, a decision that may be painful 
this year for rich government officials who want to follow their national 
soccer team to the World Cup in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 But no more biting sanctions are in the offing for Nigeria, which exports $5 
billion a year in oil to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Abacha himself remains an enigma. Some opponents contend that he is more 
cunning than Babangida, the close friend he helped bring to power in 1985. But 
Abiola, who has known both men for years, said Abacha "isn't 1% as bright as 
Babangida." 
</P>
<P>
 Trained in the United States and Britain, Abacha has, like most men in uniform 
in Nigeria, become wealthy. Among his holdings is a charter airline, which flew 
between Lagos and New York until August, when the U.S. government banned direct 
flights because of lax security at the Lagos airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Abacha has called for "a new era of discipline" to end corruption in the 
government as well as private industry. 
</P>
<P>
 But his spokesman said, "We won't waste our time" with probes into the past, 
investigations that would likely target him. 
</P>
<P>
 Optimists in Nigeria believe that Abacha just wants a comfortable retirement. 
Soldiers have ruled Nigeria for 22 of the last 26 years, but the pressure for 
democratic change now sweeping Africa, evident in last June's elections in 
Nigeria, has never been greater. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nigeria realizes it has to pay decent regard for the opinions of the world 
now," said a Western diplomat with more than three decades' experience in 
Nigeria. "They can't just go their own way any longer."

 CONS ON THE RUN: The fourth escape from the new Lancaster state prison since 
it opened last February has local civic leaders grumbling (B1). Although the 
fugitive was quickly recaptured -- he was injured by the compactor of the 
garbage truck he hid in -- "I can't convince people it's a safe prison when we 
keep having these escapes," said the head of the prison's community advisory 
committee.

 SIGN OF JUSTICE: It may be unusual to have two different types of sign 
language interpreter in one trial, such as the Val Lamar Smith case (A1), but 
signing is not uncommon in the courts. Los Angeles County Superior Court has 10 
sign language specialists, out of 550 contracted court interpreters for 80 
languages. They get $210 a day. . . . Sign language interpreters are the 
second-most used, after Spanish.

 WHERE'S THAT BALL? Valley football fans -- some in comfy local bars and others 
bundled against the cold in Orchard Park, N.Y. -- will be watching the Raiders' 
playoff today against the Buffalo Bills (C1). In Orchard Park, where the 
wind-chill factor is expected to hit 40 below zero today, Raiders defensive end 
Howie Long (above) tried to clear away snow without losing his grip on a cup of 
hot coffee.

 FANSICLES: "We're prepared," said Debra Zeldin of Canoga Park, typical of the 
die-hard fans who traveled east. "I have three or four pairs of socks, 
thermals, about four sweat shirts and coats and blankets." Zeldin and her 
mother were among about a dozen Raider Booster Club members who flew into 
Buffalo on Friday -- staying at the same hotel as their heroes. "They need all

VALLEY MURDER TRIAL WILL RELY ON 2 SIGN LANGUAGES; COURTS: DEAF WITNESSES WILL 
USE STANDARD AND INFORMAL HAND GESTURES TO GIVE TESTIMONY ON ALLEGED GANG 
SLAYING. 
</P>

<P>
 The prosecutor calls it "a very straightforward murder case," and in many ways 
the Val Lamar Smith case is depressingly similar to scores of other killings 
that occur in Los Angeles every year: Young men, allegedly members of rival 
gangs, meet up with each other and somebody winds up dead. 
</P>
<P>
 But what sets the Smith murder case apart is that most of the key figures are 
deaf. Smith, the defendant, is deaf, as was the man he is accused of killing, 
James E. Powell Jr. Several of the key witnesses also are deaf. Even the trial 
judge is hearing-impaired. 
</P>
<P>
 At the trial, scheduled to begin Tuesday in Van Nuys, the legal system will 
not only have to bridge the gap between the hearing world and the silent, but 
also that between two different forms of sign language -- one the formal 
American Sign Language, the other a less stylized form or dialect of sign 
language that has its roots in the segregated American South and lives on today 
in poor, predominantly African American neighborhoods where access to special 
schools and training for the deaf are often limited. The informal sign language 
often uses broad gestures and pantomime-style movements to get the message 
across.  
</P>
<P>
 Sign interpreters for deaf jurors or other trial participants are almost an 
everyday sight in Los Angeles courtrooms. But because Smith and some of the 
witnesses use the informal sign language, which few court-approved sign 
interpreters know, another interpreter who is herself deaf will translate a 
deaf witness' answers from informal sign into American Sign, and another 
interpreter will translate the American Sign into spoken words for the jury and 
other hearing trial participants. When the witness is asked a question, the 
process will be reversed. 
</P>
<P>
 Although not unheard-of in Los Angeles courts, the two-stage sign language 
interpreting format will be a new experience for most participants in the 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it will be interesting," said Superior Court Judge Michael Farrell. 
"I'm curious as to how it's going to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell said he is hearing-impaired, with below 50% hearing in both ears in 
conversational range -- the result, he believes, of his Army service as a tank 
crew member. However, Farrell does not understand sign language. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Shellie Samuels said it will be her first trial involving a 
deaf defendant and witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's different, and it may be a little more difficult," Samuels said. "It may 
be a little harder to judge the demeanor of a witness. . . . Uncertainty, 
anger, indignation, all the emotions -- sometimes you don't get that with sign 
language. I don't know how that's going to play to a jury. But I don't think it 
will pose any big problems." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's attorney, Tony Bryan, was unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Farrell and Samuels said they were somewhat concerned that the double 
sign interpretation process might slow down the proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had cases (with signing deaf participants) where the people are slow, 
and my gosh, it can just take forever," Farrell said. He also must be concerned 
about the accuracy of the signing, particularly the translation of the informal 
sign language. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing I have to look at is, are (the defendant and deaf witnesses) 
completely understanding what's being said?" Farrell said. "And how will I 
know?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Joseph Padilla, who supervises interpreter services for the Los Angles 
County courts, said he doesn't think there will be any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Sign interpreting "is done in split-seconds," Padilla said. "You'd be amazed 
at how fast they are. It's fascinating to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla said that Karen Bowman, a court interpreter who can sign in both 
American Sign and the informal language, will be one of the interpreters at the 
Smith trial. Bowman, who is deaf, is widely recognized as an expert in both 
sign language forms and is among the few interpreters who is court-qualified in 
the informal sign language, Padilla said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles courts employ 10 American Sign interpreters, Padilla said, adding 
that next to Spanish, American Sign is the most frequently translated language 
in the court system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Smith case began in January, 1992, when Smith, now 23, and two male 
friends, who also are deaf, drove from South-Central Los Angeles to an 
apartment complex on Vanowen Street in Van Nuys to visit friends. While there, 
the men encountered Powell, 27, a deaf Long Beach resident who had been staying 
in the apartment of Yvonne Lane, who also is deaf. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, an argument -- conducted in sign language -- broke out 
among the men, allegedly over rival gang affiliations. Smith allegedly drew a 
revolver and shot Powell, killing him. He was later arrested and held without 
bail. One of the men with him later pleaded guilty to voluntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Lane, who originally told police she had been taking a nap when the shooting 
occurred and hadn't been aware of it -- because of her hearing impairment, 
police at first believed her -- now is expected to testify in informal sign 
language that she saw Smith shoot Powell. Smith faces a life sentence if 
convicted.

BRITAIN; SEX SCANDALS CONTRADICT TORY MORALIZING; PRIME MINISTER JOHN MAJOR 
CAN'T SEEM TO PLUG ALL THE LEAKS IN HIS 'BACK TO BASICS' POLICY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Sex, that traditional despoiler of Conservative Party politicians, is creating 
yet more scandals threatening Prime Minister John Major's enfeebled government. 
</P>
<P>
 The running scandals involve sexual, political and financial peccadilloes 
among Tory politicians, which flatly contradict earnest, upright Major's new 
policy, dubbed "back to basics" -- the British equivalent of the American 
"family values" campaign in which God, church and family are stressed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tory Party has a long history of failed government ministers, enmeshed in 
scandals over extramarital sexual activities -- the most infamous modern 
incident involving Defense Secretary John Profumo, who resigned from Harold 
Macmillan's Cabinet over his relationship with call girl Christine Keeler. 
</P>
<P>
 After him, Lords Lambton and Jellicoe quit as ministers when their high jinks 
with prostitutes were exposed. Then came Cecil Parkinson -- Margaret Thatcher's 
handsome, married and favorite Cabinet secretary -- who departed during a 
Conservative Party conference when it was revealed that he had fathered a child 
with his researcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Major -- who had hoped to enjoy the political boost from an ailing economy 
that is turning upward and the Brussels NATO summit that has been deemed a 
success -- has been seen as a model of rectitude; voters expected him to 
appoint only high-minded Cabinet members and junior ministers. He had sought to 
capitalize on his public image with a call for a return to "basic" values and 
standards. 
</P>
<P>
 But this plan quickly was unwound by David Mellor, the fun-loving minister who 
was sharing the bed of would-be actress Antonia de Sanchez. She told all to 
Britain's voracious tabloid press. Mellor resigned amid blazing headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, Tim Yeo -- the engaging, well-liked environment minister and 
Tory in Parliament -- was revealed by the tabs to have fathered a child with an 
unmarried, Conservative London City Council member. Yeo publicly had spoken out 
against single mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 The disclosure about his latest offspring was followed by the revelation that 
Yeo had a previous child born out of wedlock who was given up for adoption. 
This generated a feeding frenzy in the British press, whose salaciousness is 
exceeded only by its sanctimoniousness. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeo, reflecting Tory arrogance and unmindful of Major's call for a return to 
traditional values, refused to do the gentlemanly thing and go quietly. 
Instead, he proclaimed that his private life had nothing to do with his job. He 
insisted he would remain in office. 
</P>
<P>
 But this infuriated proper Tory women in his constituency, South Suffolk in 
East Anglia; he also became a whipping boy for the righteous editorialists of 
the tabs. So Yeo was ousted -- but, in the view of Major's critics, much too 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 The floodgates then seemed to open: 
</P>
<P>
 * The newspapers recalled that Transport Minister Steven Norris was still in 
government, even though he admitted to five affairs that largely overlapped. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last weekend, the Countess of Caithness, wife of shipping minister Lord 
Caithness, committed suicide, because, her father said, her husband was 
involved with a divorced woman. Caithness resigned the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 * Then the longtime wife of David Ashby, a Tory member of Parliament, accused 
him of leaving her for a man, with whom he shared a hotel room in France 
recently during a "gastronomic holiday." Ashby, who is wealthy, said he shared 
a room and a bed with his friend to save money; he said he had done it many 
times before.  
</P>
<P>
 Two other, recent scandals have also mocked Major's moralizing: 
</P>
<P>
 * Alan Duncan, a Tory member of Parliament, ministerial assistant and a 
millionaire, lent money to a pensioner to buy a public apartment at reduced 
prices; this was part of a Tory policy meant to make ownership available to the 
underprivileged. But Duncan, it was revealed, then bought the cut-price unit 
from the purchaser. While no crime was involved, Duncan resigned as a 
ministerial assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 * Senior Tory officials in London have been accused of the "disgraceful" 
selling of public apartments in the Westminster borough -- just before the 1990 
local election -- to Conservative buyers to secure a Tory vote in marginal 
wards. 
</P>
<P>
 For Major, the scandals have diverted attention from other parts of his "back 
to basics" program, such as sterner policies on education, crime and the 
economy. Instead, the public focus now seems to be on Tory morality. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor opposition has criticized Conservative morality as "hypocrisy," and 
even Tory wags in the House of Commons refer to the "back to basics" program as 
"back to my place." Tories in a Sexual Tango 
</P>
<P>
 Britain's Conservative Party has been buffeted by the fallout from its attempt 
to push a "back to basics" campaign. A seemingly innocuous phrase at first, it 
has come instead, to symbolize efforts by party hard-liners to preach about 
morality and "family values." That approach has backfired: John Major, Prime 
minister 
</P>
<P>
 He's needed his sense of humor as criticism has mounted . . . Lord Caithness, 
Former shipping minister 
</P>
<P>
 . . . about scandals, such as circumstances surrounding suicide of this key 
party leader's wife . . . Tim Yeo, Former environment minister 
</P>
<P>
 . . . and this official's siring of children . . . David Ashby, Conservative 
member of Parliament 
</P>
<P>
 . . . and this legislator's admission that he went on vacation with a male 
friend with whom he shared a bed.

BRAZIL; ALLEGED COUP PLOT A PUZZLING PIECE OF POLITICAL THEATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAC MARGOLIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a region where military men have so often held sway, stirrings in the 
barracks make Latin Americans sit up and take notice. Brazilians paid special 
attention to a recent television newscast on which Justice Minister Mauricio 
Correa screwed his brow into a frown and unveiled what he branded a conspiracy 
against democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to say something extremely serious," he told TV Manchete, a major 
network. Not long ago, "some people" had called on President Itamar Franco with 
the mission of prodding him into endorsing a coup. 
</P>
<P>
 These "people" -- Correa never identified them -- "encouraged the president to 
promote a 'Fujimori-zation,' " he said, referring to the Brazilian term for the 
"self-coup" fashioned by Peruvian President Alberto Fujimori; Fujimori, after 
his election, temporarily shut his nation's Congress in April, 1992, and tore 
up its constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 As Correa told it, Franco, a democrat at heart, demurred; the tender Brazilian 
democracy was rescued from a threat it never knew was coming. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Correa's interview made for a dramatic but puzzling piece of political 
theater. Why did it take three months for him to reveal the plot? Why were the 
conspirators never punished? 
</P>
<P>
 Days later, outraged legislators demanded Correa appear before Congress to 
elaborate. He answered vaguely that he could not name names, and the 
legislators apparently lost interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The military command issued disclaimers and pledges to uphold democracy. 
Franco downplayed the matter, prohibiting Radiobras, the public broadcast 
network, from running a reprise of Correa's interview. In a few days, the whole 
affair dropped off the national screen. 
</P>
<P>
 But the questions lingered. Was there an imminent military takeover looming in 
Brazil? Is there still? Virtually all political observers here say no. 
</P>
<P>
 The military, which ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985, has neither the support 
nor the stomach to seize power. After all, generals had a heavy hand in making 
the mess -- the huge public debt, staggering inflation and spend-thrift 
bureaucracy -- that threatens to swallow Brazil today. 
</P>
<P>
 Last October, when the alleged plot was hatching, times were especially ripe 
for intrigue. Inflation, already a scorching 30% a month, was climbing ever 
higher, melting workers' wages and patience. The legislature, president and 
judiciary -- the pillars of this fledgling democracy -- were at war over 
everything from taxes to personnel policy. Waves of scandal were buffeting the 
Brazilian capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Fernando Collor de Mello, ousted from office after a giant 
corruption scandal, was mounting his comeback in the courts. His victory would 
have been a slap to Congress, which impeached him, and to the people, who 
poured into the streets to be rid of him. A dozen legislators were fingered for 
charging up to $50,000 to switch political parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a senior government economist admitted to having taken millions of 
dollars in kickbacks for helping divert government money into pet projects and 
the pockets of select legislators. Then came an opinion poll confirming the 
political malaise, ranking Congress as one of the country's least prestigious 
institutions, placing well below the armed forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The military have always proved to be true leaders in times of turbulence," 
Gen. Benedito Onofre Leonel, the army chief, declared in a speech. "Beware of 
the choler of the legions," he added darkly, invoking Roman centurion Marcus 
Flavinius' warning. 
</P>
<P>
 No one expected Brazil's centurions to roll their tanks into the streets, but 
their meaning was clear. In democratic Brazil, military intervention still 
serves as a default mode: Like a walking nuclear deterrent, just knowing, or 
saying, that soldiers are near is argument enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are already operating under a military half-anchor," said Walder de Goes, 
a Brazilian political scientist. "For months, the military has been saying to 
authorities 'Be careful, straighten up.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The authorities appear to be listening. Late last year, a federal court 
blocked Collor's comeback, upholding the congressional ruling of 1992 barring 
him from seeking political office until the year 2001. The confessions of the 
thieving government economist sparked an investigation into the congressional 
"budget mafia." In the coming weeks at least 20 light-fingered legislators are 
expected to be expelled from Congress.

UKRAINE DISARMAMENT DEAL MET WITH A NOTE OF DISDAIN; WEAPONS: HISTORIC 
AGREEMENT IS OVERSHADOWED BY NATIONALIST SENSITIVITY. SOME SAY CLINTON WAS 
CONDESCENDING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Even before President Leonid Kravchuk signed a historic agreement with the 
United States and Russia on Friday to give up all of Ukraine's nuclear weapons, 
the headlines here were scornful. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of the signing ceremony in Moscow, three of Kiev's leading 
newspapers reported not on the details of the groundbreaking trilateral accord 
but on what some Ukrainians considered to be condescending behavior by 
President Clinton during his two-hour visit to Kiev late Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton kept Kravchuk waiting on the tarmac of Boryspil Airport in freezing 
temperatures for at least 12 minutes before descending from Air Force One. The 
visit ended, the Kiev Vedemosti newspaper said, "with the absolutely tactless 
joke by Clinton that 'If he did not have such an important job, I would invite 
President Kravchuk to the United States to run my press conferences.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The joke was clearly intended to laud Kravchuk's skill in handling the fierce 
White House press corps. But to some Ukrainians, it sounded as though Clinton 
fancied Kravchuk his lackey. 
</P>
<P>
 Kiev Vedemosti said the meeting was meant "to put Ukraine in its place," and 
two other newspapers trumpeted Clinton's remark in Page One headlines. Though 
the flap will pass, it shows how dicey it will be for Kravchuk to sell his 
balky Parliament and nervous public on a disarmament deal -- even one that the 
White House has bent over backward to make palatable. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton praised Kravchuk's "courage and vision" in agreeing to dismantle 
Ukraine's 1,800 nuclear warheads in exchange for fuel, economic aid and 
security guarantees. But many lawmakers still view with suspicion the 
U.S.-sponsored initiative to denuclearize their nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ukrainian nationalists are still fuming over the so-called "Chicken Kiev" 
speech by former President George Bush here in 1991. Bush argued that Ukraine 
should drop its bid for independence and remain part of a newly democratic 
Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and his aides have been careful to avoid any suggestion that the 
United States views Ukraine -- a country larger than France -- as a junior 
political partner. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States is offering at least $155 million in economic aid. Equally 
important are security guarantees that Kravchuk can present to Ukrainians 
anxious that a Russia led by neo-fascist Vladimir V. Zhirinovsky might try to 
seize the Crimean peninsula from a disarmed Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 The trilateral statement says that Clinton, Kravchuk and Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin "reiterated that they will deal with one another as full and 
equal partners and that relations among their countries must be conducted on 
the basis of respect for the independence, sovereignty and territorial 
integrity of each nation." 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk underlined the "inviolability" of Ukraine's borders in remarks later 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying that nationalism "always tends to spill over the boundaries of any 
single state," Kravchuk warned that if Zhirinovsky prevails in Russia, Ukraine 
will not be the only victim. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement does not bind the United States or Russia to intervene if 
Ukraine is attacked. 
</P>
<P>
 An attachment to the statement signed Friday says that Ukraine will eliminate 
all nuclear weapons on its territory within seven years. But Ukraine will 
deactivate the SS-24 missiles, the most powerful in the Ukrainian arsenal, 
within 10 months. 
</P>
<P>
 The attachment, whose contents had not previously been made public, states 
that within 10 months, Russia must give Ukraine 100 tons of uranium fuel for 
use in nuclear power plants, and Ukraine must send Russia at least 200 nuclear 
warheads from SS-19 and SS-24 missiles for dismantling. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States will pay Russia a $60-million advance against payments 
Russia will eventually receive for reprocessing the uranium from the Ukrainian 
warheads for use as enriched uranium fuel for nuclear power plants. 
</P>
<P>
 A clear majority of Ukrainians say they see no reason to keep the atomic 
missiles left on their soil after the breakup of the Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fewer nuclear weapons we have, the more peacefully we will live," said 
Julia Dmitrienko, 40, an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we going to do with them -- fight Russia?" said Vladimir Nazaruk, 
45, a Kiev building official. "No one would win." 
</P>
<P>
 But they want "fair compensation" for the weapons. As Parliament put that sum 
at $3 billion, Kravchuk will have to try to convince voters and lawmakers that 
the current deal -- by some estimates worth about $1 billion -- is the best he 
can get. 
</P>
<P>
 A poll published Thursday found that 17.4% of Ukrainians would agree 
unconditionally to exchange the weapons in return for oil and gas and 31.4% 
would agree to such a deal if absolutely necessary. The Socis-Gallup poll found 
that 36% oppose giving up the weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk has not yet indicated whether he will try to persuade the current 
Parliament to accept the agreement, present it to the new Parliament to be 
elected March 27 or insist that the "statement" signed Friday is not a treaty 
and thus does not require parliamentary ratification. Lawmakers have already 
said they will insist on the right to decide. 
</P>
<P>
 Key lawmakers, including the Speaker of the Parliament and his deputy, have 
been silent on the deal. Neither met Clinton at the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk supporters say the economic crisis has become so acute -- Ukraine's 
monthly inflation rate hit 80% in December, compared to 12% in Russia -- that 
even hard-line lawmakers will be inclined to compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man (Kravchuk) has signed a paper saying he can do it," one senior 
American official said. "Am I 200% sure he can deliver? Let's see how it plays. 
He has a lot of incentives." 
</P>
<P>
 But pro-nuclear lawmaker Serhij Semenets said Kravchuk's authority has been 
eroded. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kravchuk does lobby, but the deputies are less and less influenced," he said. 
"It's considered unseemly to support Kravchuk." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmaker Tatiana Jakheeva joked that America has nothing to fear -- even from 
a nuclear Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be afraid of us," she said. "The worst Ukraine can do to America is 
send Kravchuk to be (Clinton's) press secretary." 
</P>
<P>
 Special correspondent Mary Mycio contributed to this report. Global Gun 
Control 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement to peacefully dismantle Ukraine's huge nuclear arsenal signed in 
Moscow on Friday would work like this: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Ukraine ships warheads to Siberia, where Russian technicians extract the 
highly enriched uranium and turn it into less powerful civilian reactor fuel. 
The United States has offered to help pay for the cost of dismantling the 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 2. In return, Ukraine receives fuel rods for its civilian power plants and 
debt relief from Russia.

NEWS ANALYSIS; COMPETING WITH BOBBITTS AND ICE SKATERS, SUMMIT FALLS SHORT; 
MEDIA: AIDES' HOPES FOR ENDURING IMAGES THAT WOULD CAPTURE A NATION AND 
STRENGTHEN A PRESIDENT FIZZLE. 
</P>

<P>
 As summit trips go -- and such events almost always go well -- President 
Clinton's journey to Belgium, the Czech Republic, Ukraine and Russia has been 
successful but not spectacularly so, at least as measured through the lens his 
advisers care most about: newspaper and television coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 No enduring images or phrases have emerged from the trip. But Clinton did 
finish stronger than he began, winning the hearts, or so the press inferred, of 
the carefully selected and polite Russian citizens he encountered during a walk 
through Moscow and a town-hall-style television show. 
</P>
<P>
 In such events, however, communications strategy and political theater work 
best in the service of real substance -- and here the press thought this summit 
was lacking. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Washington Post complained on Friday: "Summits . . . once were electric 
affairs. . . . This one . . . seemed almost dull by contrast. The most detailed 
briefing (Thursday) . . . occurred after the dinner at Yeltsin's dacha and 
focused as much on the 26-dish menu, which included lip of moose, as on 
policy." 
</P>
<P>
 The President's trip was also matched all week against competing stories: the 
investigation into Clinton's Arkansas business dealings as an investor in 
Whitewater Development Corp.; the trial of Lorena Bobbitt, charged with 
malicious wounding for cutting off her husband's penis, and the attack on 
ice-skating star Nancy Kerrigan. At one point, Cable News Network anchors 
apologized to the avalanche of callers who complained that the network had 
broken away from the Bobbitt trial to cover the President. 
</P>
<P>
 To the White House, how the summit plays at home -- especially on television 
-- is critical. Foreign travel can be a shot of adrenaline for a President's 
domestic prestige. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trip to Tokyo last year was enormously helpful in passing the budget," 
presidential adviser Paul Begala said. "If he (Clinton) had screwed up, the 
budget would have failed." 
</P>
<P>
 On that scale, this trip had a tough send-off. "This is the most disorganized 
presidential trip I can remember," said a veteran White House reporter before 
leaving last week. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Times columnist William Safire wrote that he doubted Clinton had 
thought enough about foreign policy to have a coherent world view. 
</P>
<P>
 And logistics were a problem. The Administration, searching desperately for a 
photogenic place for Clinton to begin the trip with a speech, had to settle on 
an undefined audience of young people in the ornate Brussels town hall. 
</P>
<P>
 By Thursday, however, the Administration had reversed the press's skepticism. 
Even conservative critics were conceding the summit's successes. "He has done a 
nice job," former George Bush Labor Secretary Lynn Martin said on a talk show, 
adding, "but we tend to overrate summits." 
</P>
<P>
 How much Clinton has helped his image is debatable. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the strategists who conceived foreign policy for Bush and Ronald Reagan, 
the key test of coverage was turning off the sound on the television set and 
looking for enduring moments or visual images that would register with people 
who were not paying close attention. Those were the images that would 
strengthen a President. 
</P>
<P>
 There appear to have been none. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the elaborately staged pictures, the images highlighted by The Times, 
the Washington Post and the New York Times featured the President stuffing food 
or drink into his mouth. 
</P>
<P>
 To some extent, the business of creating enduring images has grown more 
difficult. With the media becoming cynical about staged "photo opportunities," 
the television pictures of Clinton walking across the Charles Bridge in Prague 
highlighted not the President himself but the throng of photographers behind 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the problem can be blamed on the White House. Clinton made his most 
important announcement of the trip -- that Ukraine would dismantle its nuclear 
weapons -- in front of a North Atlantic Treaty Organization poster -- hardly a 
powerful visual metaphor. 
</P>
<P>
 And Clinton's staff still falls short of the standards set by the Reagan White 
House for creating images that capture the story the President wants to tell. 
Reagan's team knew how to inject seemingly spontaneous events into their boss' 
schedule. The press regularly reported these moments because they seemed 
unrehearsed, even if they weren't. 
</P>
<P>
 Republican television strategist Roger Ailes charged that the media are mostly 
interested in attacks and gaffes, and that the job of presidential aides is to 
shield their boss or at least make sure he controls himself. On Wednesday, this 
White House failed to do either. 
</P>
<P>
 The enduring image from Wednesday was of the President abruptly standing up, 
pulling a wire out of his ear and ending an interview with NBC's Jim 
Miklaszewski because the correspondent asked about Whitewater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry you're not interested in the trip," the President snapped.

YELTSIN FOE IS ELECTED SPEAKER OF LOWER HOUSE; POLITICS: COMMUNIST'S WIN IN 
DUMA COMES A DAY AFTER A SUPPORTER OF THE RUSSIAN LEADER IS CHOSEN TO LEAD THE 
UPPER CHAMBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 As Boris N. Yeltsin basked in the limelight of a summit with President Clinton 
on Friday, the lower house of Russia's new Parliament elected one of the 
president's Communist opponents as its Speaker after a raucous dispute over a 
single paper ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivan Rybkin, leader of the Communist faction in the old Soviet-era Parliament, 
won the leadership of the 444-member Duma with 222 clearly marked ballots in 
his favor and one in which his name was underlined and his rival's crossed out. 
</P>
<P>
 A special vote-counting panel of lawmakers, after two hours behind closed 
doors, overruled a protest by Yeltsin's supporters and awarded the disputed 
ballot to Rybkin, a member of the Agrarian Party that is led by Communist 
collective-farm bosses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rybkin's only challenger also was a foe of Yeltsin's reforms: Yuri Vlasov, a 
onetime Olympic weightlifting champion who got 23 votes. Pro-reform deputies, 
whose candidates had been knocked off the ballot Thursday, abstained Friday, 
trying to force the Duma to consider new candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote came on the fourth day of the new Parliament's session and a day 
after Yeltsin ally Vladimir F. Shumeiko was elected to lead the Federation 
Council, the upper house. The votes showed the two houses divided roughly 
evenly between pro- and anti-Yeltsin camps. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had been wondering, 'How many people do we have on each side in 
Parliament?' " said economist Grigory Yavlinsky, leader of a pro-reform faction 
in the Duma. "Today, we saw it is exactly half. That's workable. We can have 
some hope." 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Yeltsin forcibly dissolved a Soviet-era Parliament that was stacked 
even more against him and jailed its chairman, Ruslan I. Khasbulatov. The new, 
smaller Parliament is less powerful, having come to life last month under a new 
constitution that strengthens the presidency. Yeltsin has stripped the 
Speaker's office of funds to dole out perks such as cars, dachas and city 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the new Duma promises to be a major headache for Yeltsin -- if only 
because it is the bully pulpit of neo-fascist firebrand Vladimir V. 
Zhirinovsky, whose party showed surprising strength in the Dec. 12 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 After a week of ranting and bellowing and pounding on the Speaker's podium, 
Zhirinovsky got into a fistfight Friday with a pro-Yeltsin deputy who accused 
him of cutting into the Duma cafeteria line. The Interfax news agency said 
Zhirinovsky exploded, "Shut up while you're still in one piece!" 
</P>
<P>
 The Duma has provided entertainment for President Clinton, who called it a 
"product of democracy" and said he had followed its sessions on television 
during his European tour this week. "I enjoy watching the news every night," he 
said. "It's nice to be in a place where some other president's having trouble 
with his Parliament instead of me."

RUSSIAN ADJUSTS TO THE EXECUTIVE SWEET; ECONOMICS: DIRECTOR OF MOSCOW CHOCOLATE 
FACTORY STRUGGLES TO RECONCILE HIS CAPITALIST DUTY WITH HIS COMMUNIST VALUES. 
</P>

<P>
 For Americans struggling to understand the agonies of Russia's conversion to 
free-market economics, meet Anatoly Nikolaevich Daursky. 
</P>
<P>
 Outwardly, he would have been perfectly at home standing, grim-faced, atop a 
Kremlin wall with his fellow Communists reviewing Red Army tanks in a May Day 
parade. But here he is, talking like the 59-year-old capitalist he has become. 
</P>
<P>
 Daursky is general director of a chocolate factory called Red October -- a 
name imposed by the Bolsheviks after the 1917 Revolution. And on his shoulders, 
more than broad enough to fill out his double-breasted suit, rest the problems 
and potential of capitalism in Russia. 
</P>
<P>
 Red October is now a privately held company turning out 240 tons of chocolate 
daily and, of all things, a profit each month. In the company's lobby, a 
plaster statue of V. I. Lenin, seemingly coated with shiny white icing, is 
largely ignored by workers scurrying to and fro. 
</P>
<P>
 Daursky has survived an ouster attempt by shareholders, but he still struggles 
daily with the last vestiges of state control and his own lingering uncertainty 
about how to reconcile capitalist duty with the Communist values ingrained in 
his apparatchik soul. 
</P>
<P>
 He fights to hold costs down and productivity up, for example. But ignoring 
strict capitalist discipline, he still ships some candy to the far north, 
despite the higher transportation costs and lower profits. Why? Because the 
people there, including soldiers, "are still Russians" and deserve their 
sweets. 
</P>
<P>
 The old factory on the banks of the Moscow River is a favored stop for 
visiting politicians touting capitalism's advantages. Treasury Secretary Lloyd 
Bentsen toured the plant floor Friday as ribbons of chocolate poured out of 
vats and turned into candy bars. Removing a $20 bill from his pocket, he bought 
a share of stock valued at 100 rubles, worth roughly 7 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Daursky, who would not disclose his own salary, pays his workers an average of 
$140 a month and managers roughly $260. The plant employs more than 3,000 
people, an increase of 600 over the past two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase in workers reflects the complex pressures facing management in 
the transition to a profit-based operation. A marketing department has been 
created to help sell the product, for example. There is also a new financial 
department to manage costs and investment. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in line with the Communist pattern of factory-based social services, the 
company payroll also includes a medical department for the employees. And 
inside the factory near the entrance, the company cobbler works. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an artist. He can do anything," Daursky said. "Why do we keep him? To 
make life easier for our lady employees." The shoemaker's presence allows them 
to drop off shoes needing repair each morning and pick them up at the day's end 
without having to take time off to stand in line at a private repair shop. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer must Daursky turn over 10% of his product to the state. But, 
questioned whether he is truly free to manage his company -- which he joined as 
an engineer fresh out of college in 1958 -- he said: "You cannot say there is 
no government control. There is control. There is taxation." 
</P>
<P>
 Has his life changed? He paused, smiled, and said yes, it has. 
</P>
<P>
 "My blood pressure is all right, thank God," he said. But now there are 
worries. And the Communist Party membership that he maintained as he rose in 
the company hierarchy -- "I wouldn't have been a director otherwise," he said 
with no apology -- offers him no protection today. 
</P>
<P>
 He must keep up with new legislation affecting businesses. He must plot the 
next moves of the company. He must set prices. He must report to a chairman of 
the board. And the shareholders can fire him. In short, he said, "everything 
has to be rethought."

WITH U.N. APPROVAL, SHIP BRINGS FUEL TO HAITI; EMBARGO: AUTHORIZED DELIVERY IS 
MEANT TO EASE THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC SANCTIONS ON THE POOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A faded red tanker slipped into Port-au-Prince's harbor at dawn Friday and 
unloaded 400,000 gallons of gasoline and diesel fuel in an officially 
sanctioned violation of the economic embargo of Haiti's military dictatorship. 
</P>
<P>
 The shipment was authorized by the United Nations under pressure from the 
United States, which is concerned that public revulsion over the deadly impact 
of the sanctions on Haiti's desperately poor majority could ultimately weaken 
the Clinton Administration's effort to force the military out of power. 
</P>
<P>
 Haiti has been under an international boycott since mid-October, when the 
military reneged on an agreement to permit the return of President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who has lived in exile in the United States since his 
violent overthrow in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than force the military to accept Aristide's return, however, the 
embargo, particularly against the importation of fuel, has all but destroyed 
the country's economy and infrastructure and has pushed much of the 
impoverished majority to -- if not over -- the edge of starvation. 
</P>
<P>
 That situation led the United States to ease the embargo and permit enough 
fuel in to allow such groups as CARE, Catholic Relief Services and others to 
restore deteriorating feeding programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The tanker, named the Eupleta Douglas and accompanied by a destroyer sent by 
the United Nations, was tied up to the petroleum dock for no more than nine 
hours in hopes of avoiding threatened efforts to prevent either its docking or 
unloading. 
</P>
<P>
 The day passed without incident, unlike the events of Oct. 11, when a U.S. 
military cargo ship, the Harlan County, was prevented from landing and 
unloading unarmed Army engineers and road-building equipment by a rampaging mob 
sponsored by Haiti's military leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite threats to repeat the Harlan County episode, no attempts were made to 
keep the Eupleta Douglas away from the unloading pipe or to interfere with the 
pumping operation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the danger is not over, according to diplomats, even though the military 
high command has pledged not to interfere with the distribution of the fuel -- 
300,000 gallons of which is dedicated strictly to non-governmental humanitarian 
agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The great fear now," one diplomat said, "is when they (the humanitarian 
groups) come to get the gas. There is no way we can protect them; they will be 
on their own." 
</P>
<P>
 Various groups, all virulently anti-Aristide, have threatened to stop trucks 
trying to pick up the fuel or even to steal it on grounds that the distribution 
is not truly equitable. 
</P>
<P>
 According to U.N. spokesman Erik Falk, starting Monday approved agencies will 
be allowed to buy specified amounts of fuel for $1.20 a gallon, with smaller 
groups getting 100 gallons and larger ones, such as CARE, as much as 20,000 
gallons. 
</P>
<P>
 With 100,000 gallons being kept in reserve for emergencies, the remaining 
300,000 is supposed to last two months. According to Douglas Greene of Catholic 
Relief Services, the fuel will permit his organization to resume two feedings a 
day for the 170,000 people it serves in Port-au-Prince and nearby cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of CARE, which normally provides daily meals to about 600,000 
people, mostly in the impoverished northwest, said they had been forced by a 
lack of fuel to cut back to feeding only 200,000 on some days. 
</P>
<P>
 The new shipment, if it holds together, will enable CARE to restore its 
program at least until mid-February. 
</P>
<P>
 One segment of Haiti that has survived is the bull's-eye of the embargo 
target: the military. According to diplomats and other sources close to the 
army high command, the military has about 200,000 gallons of fuel in storage 
and is smuggling in enough from the neighboring Dominican Republic to resell at 
a large profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The border is leaking like a sieve," one foreign military expert said. "The 
military is selling it to the country's electric and telephone companies and 
then using part of the profits to pay its soldiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't care about the people, and as far as I can tell they have no plans 
to deal with, let alone solve, the conflict with the world."

MILITARY NO-SHOWS DON'T FAZE HAITI MEETING'S BACKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE CLARY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials in the government of exiled Haitian President Jean-Bertrand Aristide 
expressed hope that a three-day conference that began here Friday would hasten 
the return of democracy to that troubled Caribbean nation, despite the apparent 
refusal of any leaders of the entrenched military regime to attend the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Herve Denis, Aristide's minister for information and culture, said that the 
purpose of the conference is to rally international support "for a political 
solution" to the crisis in Haiti, where a clique of military strongmen has 
ruled since Aristide's overthrow in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 250 people expected at the conference are many business people and 
politicians from Haiti as well as Lawrence A. Pezzullo, President Clinton's 
special adviser on Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Denis said that he is not surprised by the failure of Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras or 
any of his representatives to show up. "The military doesn't respect their 
commitments; we are used to it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Denis and Jean Casimir, Haiti's ambassador to Washington, told 
reporters in a briefing that the conference would be useful in reaffirming the 
commitment of both Aristide and the Clinton Administration to a 3-month-old oil 
and arms embargo that is causing increased hardship in Haiti for both the poor 
and the business elite. 
</P>
<P>
 "The embargo will cause the population to suffer a little more, but that will 
drive out the military," Casimir said. "The embargo is the only way to create 
the conditions to change the social and political situation." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide also could use the weekend meeting to settle on a replacement for 
Prime Minister Robert Malval, a respected businessman who resigned last month. 
He remains in Port-au-Prince as acting prime minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some signs that the Clinton Administration's support for Aristide, a 
leftist priest who became Haiti's first democratically elected president, had 
been flagging in recent months, the Administration has signaled its approval of 
the conference by sending Pezzullo. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide is to address the conference today. 
</P>
<P>
 One plan to restore democracy to Haiti was reached in an agreement signed on 
Governors Island in New York Harbor in July. In that pact, Cedras was to 
relinquish power and Aristide was to be returned to the presidency Oct. 30. But 
Cedras reneged on his promise to resign, and Aristide decided it was too 
dangerous to return to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the embargo has been reimposed and the Haitian impasse has grown 
more intractable. 
</P>
<P>
 When Aristide first proposed a Miami conference, its announced focus was 
refugee issues. But Administration officials persuaded Aristide to broaden its 
scope to include the means to a political settlement of the Haitian crisis -- 
and to invite the military rulers as well as opposition Haitian politicians and 
business people. 
</P>
<P>
 Casimir told reporters that the military had tried to intimidate many Haitians 
to keep them away from the meeting. "The minister of finance's house was 
sprayed with bullets to frighten her," he said. The minister, Marie Michele 
Rey, was not injured. But she is not coming to the conference.

PROSECUTOR SAYS GERMAN CARVED SWASTIKA HERSELF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A wheelchair-bound German schoolgirl who caused a public outcry with a story 
that skinheads carved a swastika on her cheek probably did it herself, a 
prosecutor said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Public prosecutor Juergen Hossfeld said the investigation showed that the 
17-year-old girl apparently was lying when she said three skinheads had cut her 
for refusing to shout Nazi slogans. 
</P>
<P>
 German radio said the girl and her parents had disappeared from the east 
German city of Halle on Thursday, three days after the alleged attack, which 
was denounced by German leaders and even drew condemnation from the Vatican. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said doubts were raised early in the search because no suspects 
and no witnesses could be found despite a hunt by more than 100 policemen.

 Five Palestinians and an Israeli were killed in clashes in Israel's occupied 
territories.It was the highest single-day death toll in the occupied 
territories since a peace accord was signed Sept. 13. A nine-hour gun battle 
with soldiers in Hebron ended in the deaths of three prison escapees and a 
fourth man. One soldier was wounded. In the Gaza Strip, an Islamic militant 
stabbed an Israeli to death and seriously wounded another before being shot and 
killed.

 Former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir acknowledged ordering the 
execution of a rogue member of his pre-state underground, according to his 
autobiography. The account is the first time Shamir has discussed his role in 
the pre-state underground, although he never denied others' reports. He does 
not write how the execution was carried out, but some historians say Shamir did 
it personally after a quick trial on the sand dunes south of Tel Aviv.

 A wheelchair-bound German schoolgirl who caused a public outcry with a story 
that skinheads carved a swastika on her cheek probably did it herself, a 
prosecutor said. Public prosecutor Juergen Hossfeld said the investigation 
showed that the 17-year-old girl apparently was lying when she said three 
skinheads had cut her for refusing to shout Nazi slogans.

IN JAPAN, PARENTS PLAY DEVIL'S ADVOCATE IN NAMING CHILD; CONTROVERSY: COUPLE 
FIGHTS AUTHORITIES' BAN ON SATANIC MONIKER. NOW THE CABINET HAS GOTTEN 
INVOLVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 "A Boy Named Sue," the American country music classic, plays the name game for 
laughs. But in Japan, a real boy, who really is named Devil, has become a 
serious matter for bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
 And Friday, the case -- which has turned into a battle over whether parents 
have the inalienable right to name their children or whether the government can 
intervene -- reached the attention of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's 
Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 The bedeviling case began when Shigeharu Sato, 30, and his wife, Ayako, 22, 
went to register their first-born son as Akuma (Devil) last August. Authorities 
in Akishima, a town within Tokyo, initially agreed to list the name in the 
family register, a move that gives it official recognition in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But two months later, higher officials, citing fears the boy would be 
subjected to ridicule and discrimination, overruled the judgment and asked the 
couple to choose another name. These officials called the Satos' selection "an 
abuse of the right of parents to name a child" and said the earlier decision to 
allow it ran against "healthy social concepts." 
</P>
<P>
 The Satos, intent on their choice, have taken the case to Family Court, which 
will decide the matter, possibly next week. 
</P>
<P>
 But in an indicator of Japanese sensitivities on the issue, Justice Minister 
Akira Mikazuki, in a Cabinet meeting Friday, spoke out about Devil, opposing 
the official intervention in the boy's naming via an "administrative guidance," 
a ruling made without specific legal basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not appropriate to instruct parents to change children's names without 
legal basis," Mikazuki said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Home Affairs Minister Kanju Sato defended the ruling, calling for new 
legislation to empower such decisions explicitly. 
</P>
<P>
 The two ministers agreed on one point: Devil is not a good name for a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Naming a child in Japan is considered one of the biggest decisions parents 
make. Fortune-tellers are often consulted to ensure that lucky choices are 
made; even the average bookstore has a special section jammed with 
do-it-yourself instruction books on choosing a fortuitous name. 
</P>
<P>
 The Satos made their decision without help. The father, who runs a snack 
restaurant, said he picked the name to show he wants his son, whatever he 
became in the future, to "stand at the top." He also wanted his son to have a 
name different from other boys and was sure that "there will be only one 
Japanese with this name," he told Japanese reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you hear it once, you'll never forget the name. . . . It is the best 
possible name," Sato said, adding he intended to raise Devil in a way to 
overcome any bullying that he might suffer. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, he admitted, was "surprised" but agreed to the name. The couple call 
Devil, who was born July 30, by the nickname Aku, the equivalent of "Dev" in 
English. The baby, still officially nameless, already responds to that name. 
Children in Japan officially may not change their given names until they reach 
age 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Sato told reporters he has already chosen a name for a second son: Teio 
(Emperor). He said he would choose "an ordinary cute name" for a daughter.

NEWS ANALYSIS; CROATIA RISKS CUTTING ITS OWN THROAT; BALKANS: MILITARY 
INTERFERENCE IN BOSNIA OPENS DOOR TO SANCTIONS AND COULD ENCOURAGE SERBIAN 
AGGRESSION. 
</P>

<P>
 An ethnic carve-up of Bosnia-Herzegovina might fulfill nationalist dreams of a 
Greater Croatia, but opposition leaders, human rights advocates and even some 
allies of President Franjo Tudjman are beginning to see the expansion drive as 
the greatest peril confronting the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Partitioning Bosnia into three ethnic ministates would lead to a Greater 
Serbia on Croatia's border and maroon at least two-thirds of Bosnia's 750,000 
Croats in resentful Serbian and Muslim enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Zagreb's conscription of Croatian reservists to fight for territory in central 
Bosnia is also provoking threats of economic sanctions by the West, which has 
imposed punitive embargoes on Serbia for similar interference in the Bosnian 
crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Most dangerous, in the view of increasing numbers of Croats and U.N. 
observers, is the precedent of accommodating forced border changes that would 
be set by dividing Bosnia. That could cement rebel Serb control over occupied 
territory in Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Morality and sentimentality aside, (it) would not be in Croatian national 
interests" if Bosnia were to be divided, warned Ante Tripalo, head of the Soros 
Foundation's Open Society Fund and a leading member of the liberal Croatian 
People's Party. "If you can change borders in Bosnia, it sets a precedent that 
allows Croatian borders to change too." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebel Serbs conquered and occupied nearly one-third of Croatia in a six-month 
war in 1991 and have declared it the independent Republic of Serbian Krajina. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 14,000 U.N. peacekeeping troops were deployed to the occupied 
territory almost two years ago to await a breakthrough in paralyzed peace talks 
between Zagreb authorities and the Serbian rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 But no sooner had the U.N. soldiers taken up patrols than the Serb nationalist 
quest for a Greater Serbia turned its attention to Bosnian territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebels armed and instigated by Belgrade laid siege to Sarajevo and other 
cities, setting in motion a bloody cycle of attack and retaliation that now has 
all three Bosnian ethnic groups -- Serbs, Croats and Muslims -- battling for 
territory on which to build segregated states. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been clear since 1991 that Tudjman and (Serbian President Slobodan) 
Milosevic have a deal to divide Bosnia that does not take into account the 
Muslims," Tripalo said. "The deal was to divide Bosnia in two. But what has 
happened when they have tried to divide into three is genocide among all three 
peoples." 
</P>
<P>
 Tudjman and Milosevic met in early 1991, before their own conflict, in what 
one senior Croatian government source confirmed was a session in which they 
discussed how they should divide Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The rival presidents have met several times since to mark off borders in 
Bosnia, and last May they dispatched their Bosnian proxies, Serb nationalist 
Radovan Karadzic and his Croat counterpart, Mate Boban, to draw a map detailing 
a three-way carve-up at a secret meeting in Montenegro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Karadzic-Boban formula has been used as a basis for partition talks in 
Geneva being mediated by Britain's Lord Owen and special U.N. envoy Thorvald 
Stoltenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bosnia's largest nationality, Muslim Slavs who made up 44% of the 
population before the war, have spurned their attackers' plans for uneven 
partitioning; they have lately been putting up a fierce fight for the country's 
survival. 
</P>
<P>
 Muslim-led government troops have taken village after village from their 
former allies, the Bosnian Croat forces that turned on them more than a year 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Tudjman threatened in a New Year's Day speech to send more government troops 
to back Croats in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 Croatian Foreign Minister Mate Granic conceded in an interview that Bosnian 
Croats "made some mistakes" that led to collapse of the Muslim-Croat alliance, 
including the massacre of Muslim civilians in the central Bosnian villages of 
Ahmici and Stupni Do and the destruction of a historic 400-year-old stone 
bridge in the southern city of Mostar. 
</P>
<P>
 In the face of mounting Bosnian Croat losses to poorly armed but determined 
Bosnian government troops, Granic said the Zagreb leadership has come to regard 
repair of the Croat-Muslim alliance as the highest priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that trust between the peoples is at a very, very low level," 
he said of Croats and Muslims, now engaged in a seemingly unstoppable 
bloodletting. 
</P>
<P>
 While Granic seemed reluctant to openly criticize Tudjman or Gojko Susak -- 
the Bosnian-born, ardently nationalist Croatian defense minister -- others in 
the leadership have expressed concern that Croatian involvement in Bosnia is 
endangering the nation's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it is in our interest to risk our image as a nation prepared to 
come to a peaceful agreement by getting involved in open military 
intervention," parliamentary Speaker Stipe Mesic told the weekly Globus. 
</P>
<P>
 Mesic pointed out that partitioning Bosnia and letting Croatian and Serbian 
regions annex to their neighboring mother states would extend Serb rule along 
most of Croatia's border, making it easier for Greater Serbia to supply rebels 
in Krajina. 
</P>
<P>
 "Croatia's major strategic interest is that no borders be changed," Mesic told 
the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 Mario Nobilo, Croatia's U.N. ambassador, conceded that dividing Bosnia poses 
"the risk of a precedent" that could result in losing international support for 
Zagreb's campaign to recover Krajina. 
</P>
<P>
 But, like most in the inner circle of Tudjman's ruling Croatian Democratic 
Union, he appeared confident that Croatia can somehow annex part of Bosnia 
without sacrificing its own territorial integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials of the U.N. Protection Force seeking to defuse the Balkan 
crisis contend that Tudjman's simultaneous push for expansion into Bosnia and 
recovery of lost land from the Serbs risks a showdown war between Zagreb and 
Belgrade that the Serbs would be likely to win. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could lead their country into an appalling disaster," one senior U.N. 
official said of Tudjman and a handful of Bosnian-born Croatian government 
ministers pursuing annexation of the Herzegovina region. "There is a very real 
danger that Croatia could crumble as a state within the next few years, if some 
of the current, very shortsighted policies are not changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Zoran Pusic, head of the Defense of Human Rights group and a prominent member 
of the opposition Social Democratic Union, has been documenting what he says 
are illegal actions by the Croatian leadership to send troops to back Bosnian 
Croats in the fight against the Muslim-led government. 
</P>
<P>
 He and other human rights monitors contend that at least 2,000 Croatian 
citizens have been called up and dispatched to Bosnia in the last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is intolerable for an independent state to allow its citizens to be 
drafted by some other army," Pusic said of the mobilizations. "These people 
have been informed at the military camps they were taken to that they were 
being drafted, not by the Croatian army, but by the HVO" -- Bosnian Croat 
forces. 
</P>
<P>
 Pusic said his groups aims to publicize government human rights violations in 
hopes of deterring them: "I can't explain -- I can't even understand -- such 
blindness on the part of the Croatian government in its policy toward Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 He lamented the lack of logic in Boban's having turned on Muslim allies, who 
outnumbered Bosnia's Croats more than 2 to 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has stated repeatedly that it sought to protect the interests 
of Croats in Bosnia, but it actually endangered most of the Croatian people 
there" by pushing for delineation of a Croatian ministate that is home to less 
than one-third of Bosnian Croats. The rest are scattered throughout the 
republic and might be pressured to migrate out of the Serbian and Muslim 
regions.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our government is still sensitive to international pressure," Pusic said, 
predicting that Tudjman may curtail support to the Bosnian Croats if Western 
leaders keep threatening sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
 Mira Ljubic-Lorger, another opposition figure, insists that there is hope for 
democracy in Croatia and predicts an ouster of the Tudjman regime by the year's 
end.

5 PALESTINIANS, 1 ISRAELI KILLED IN TERRITORIES

<TEXT>
<P>
 In the bloodiest day since Israel and the PLO signed their peace accord four 
months ago, five Palestinians and an Israeli were killed Friday in clashes in 
Israel's occupied territories. 
</P>
<P>
 A nine-hour gun battle with soldiers in Hebron ended in the deaths of three 
prison escapees and a fourth man.One soldier was wounded. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Gaza Strip, an Islamic militant stabbed an Israeli to death and 
seriously wounded another before being shot and killed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islamic Resistance Movement, or Hamas, claimed responsibility for the Gaza 
attack in announcements made over mosque loudspeakers in Gaza City. 
</P>
<P>
 The army issued a statement saying the four men killed in Hebron also belonged 
to Hamas, which opposes the accord between Israel and the Palestine Liberation 
Organization. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the highest single-day death toll in the occupied territories since a 
peace accord was signed Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty-six Palestinians and 2 Israelis have been killed since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Talks between Israel an the PLO on implementing the accord have bogged down 
over disputes. As attention focuses on a scheduled Sunday summit meeting 
between President Clinton and Syrian President Hafez Assad in Geneva, the 
latest bloodshed was likely to deepen disenchantment on all sides.

SHAMIR ADMITS EXECUTION DURING JEWISH UNDERGROUND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir acknowledged ordering the 
execution of a rogue member of his pre-state underground and said it was the 
hardest decision he ever made, according to his autobiography. 
</P>
<P>
 Shamir's recollection of his years in the Jewish underground is part of his 
recently completed autobiography, excerpts of which were published Friday in 
the daily Yediot Ahronot.The book has not been published. 
</P>
<P>
 The account is the first time Shamir has acknowledged his role in the killing 
or even discussed his role in the pre-state underground, although he never 
denied others' reports. 
</P>
<P>
 Shamir said underground fighter Eliyahu Giladi began behaving like a lunatic, 
fighting with fellow members and calling for the killing of innocent Jewish 
civilians and members of the Zionist leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man simply lost his mind," Shamir wrote. "I knew I had to make a fateful 
decision, and I never avoided it." 
</P>
<P>
 He does not write how Giladi was executed, but some historians say Shamir did 
it personally after a quick trial on the sand dunes south of Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
 The execution so traumatized Shamir that he named his daughter Gilad after 
Giladi.

 A baby elephant, separated from a herd that had strayed off its fire-ravaged 
reserve and wreaked havoc in several towns, died in a zoo from infections and 
apparent loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried, but the little elephant is dead," A.K. Das, director of the 
Calcutta Zoo, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At least six people were trampled to death by the herd during its 10-day 
odyssey in early January that brought the herd as close as 60 miles to 
Calcutta, a city of 10 million people. 
</P>
<P>
 The herd has since returned to its forest home.

EX-CLINTON AIDE FACES S&L CASE SUBPOENA; WHITEWATER: FBI FOCUSES ON WHAT CHIEF 
OF STAFF TO THEN-ARKANSAS GOVERNOR KNOWS OF THRIFT OWNER'S ROLE IN THE PAYING 
OFF OF A $50,000 LOAN. 
</P>

 The FBI has notified Betsey Wright, a senior aide to President Clinton when he 
was governor of Arkansas, that she will receive a grand jury subpoena in the 
expanding investigation of Clinton's business dealings with the owner of a 
failed savings and loan, Wright acknowledged Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI also subpoenaed documents this week from a small Arkansas bank that 
loaned Clinton and his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, $50,000 to help finance 
his 1984 campaign for governor. 
</P>
<P>
 The subpoenas are part of a wide-ranging federal investigation into ties 
between the Clintons and their former business partner, James B. McDougal, the 
owner of the now-defunct Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan here. 
</P>
<P>
 Numerous questions have been raised about whether the Clintons and McDougal 
improperly benefited financially from the relationship and Atty. Gen. Janet 
Reno is preparing to appoint a special counsel to investigate the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The primary focus of the investigation is the Whitewater Development Corp., a 
partnership formed by the Clintons and McDougal in 1978 to develop 200 acres of 
resort land in the Ozark Mountains. The Clintons have said that they lost 
$68,900 in the venture but key records apparently are missing and FBI agents 
have been trying to reconstruct the finances of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Among some of the questions investigators hope to answer is whether McDougal 
received political favors in exchange for helping the Clintons pay off the 
$50,000 loan. McDougal has told reporters that he staged a fund-raiser in 1985 
to help retire the debt. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators apparently believe that Wright may be able to shed light on the 
loan issue. She attended the 1985 fund-raiser as then-Gov. Clinton's chief of 
staff and helped collect $35,000 toward the loan repayment. 
</P>
<P>
 Although campaign laws require such contributions to be reported to the state, 
the list of contributors to the Madison Guaranty fund-raiser has disappeared 
and Wright has said that she does not know what happened to it. 
</P>
<P>
 Wright acknowledged Friday that the FBI had informed her this week that she 
would be subpoenaed. She also said, however, that she was told the subpoena had 
been withdrawn temporarily pending the naming of the special counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 In anticipation of the subpoena, Wright said that she moved several boxes of 
documents from her office at the Wexler Group, a Washington lobbying firm and 
part of the Hill & Knowlton communications firm, to her Washington home. She 
said that she plans to sort through the material over the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will be happy to help anyone to get the history sorted out," Wright said. 
</P>
<P>
 She declined to disclose the nature of the material sought by the FBI or the 
types of documents she said she is examining. 
</P>
<P>
 However, during the 1992 presidential campaign, Wright collected numerous 
documents to rebut questions raised then about the Clintons' involvement with 
McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 The Whitewater case is not the first White House controversy in which Wright 
has become involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, she took time off from her lobbying job to help senior 
presidential aide Bruce Lindsey coordinate the White House response to 
allegations made against the President by two Arkansas state troopers. They 
claimed that the President offered them federal jobs to discourage them from 
speaking publicly about his alleged extramarital affairs while he was governor. 
</P>
<P>
 FBI agents also served a new subpoena this week on the small Arkansas bank 
that actually made the $50,000 loan to the Clintons in 1984, in an apparent 
attempt to uncover the loan's paper trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The institution -- the Bank of Cherry Valley -- was owned in part by W. 
Maurice Smith, a former member of Clinton's staff. There was no collateral for 
the loan, which was used by Clinton to bolster his gubernatorial campaign in 
its final days. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, later named by Clinton to head the Arkansas highway department, is a 
longtime friend and political confidant of the President. According to Wright, 
he was Clinton's mentor and "like a father" to the young Arkansas politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators examining the failure of Madison Guaranty suspect that 
some of the money raised by McDougal may actually have come from the savings 
and loan's funds, sources said. The White House has said that Clinton and his 
campaign would have had no way of knowing the origin of the contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Leon Foust, the president of the First Bank of Arkansas, which bought the Bank 
of Cherry Valley, confirmed Friday that the institution has received three 
subpoenas in recent weeks from FBI agents, the most recent coming Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Foust declined to discuss the nature of the material sought by the subpoenas. 
But a knowledgeable source said that the FBI is seeking bank records related to 
the Clintons' loan and checks used to pay it off in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said that investigators also are interested in checks sent to the Bank 
of Cherry Valley from the Whitewater Development Corp. account at Madison 
Guaranty. 
</P>
<P>
 Some records have been located and turned over to the FBI, Foust said, and 
bank staff members are trying to find additional material. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've complied with the subpoenas to the best of our ability and we are still 
searching for records," Foust said. 
</P>
<P>
 The possibility that Madison Guaranty funds were contributed to Clinton's 
campaign is one of several questions expected to be examined by the special 
counsel.

WHITEWATER PROBE SPARKS LITTLE PUBLIC INTEREST, SURVEY FINDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Despite intense media coverage, most Americans are paying little or no 
attention to news accounts of the investigation into President Clinton's past 
business dealings, according to a survey released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, after a month in which the so-called Whitewater story has 
increasingly become the focus of White House press coverage, Clinton's approval 
rating has remained unchanged at 48%, according to the study by Times Mirror 
Center for People and the Press. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey, in which 1,494 adults were interviewed from Jan. 6 through Jan. 
13, has a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points. The results 
could have been influenced by the wording of the questions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Mirror Center is owned by Times Mirror Co., which also owns The 
Times and other newspaper and communications operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 13% of those interviewed said they had paid "very close" attention to 
questions about the First Family's investment in Whitewater Development Corp., 
an Ozark Mountain vacation resort, while Clinton was governor of Arkansas, the 
survey found. Twenty-nine percent said they had paid "fairly close" attention. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, 57% said they had followed the stories "not too closely" or "not 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Only 15% of those surveyed said they had paid very close attention to claims 
by some Arkansas state troopers that they helped arrange extramarital affairs 
for Clinton when he was governor and before his presidential inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 60% of those interviewed said they had followed that story "not too 
closely" and "not at all closely." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's approval rating was highest in February, 1993, gradually dropping to 
a low point in June and August. It has climbed since then, with a slight dip in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 The low level of interest in the Whitewater story is not out of line with past 
survey figures concerning stories about Washington controversies or allegations 
of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, when the Times Mirror Center first began examining such matters, 
the highest level of interest in such stories -- 31% -- occurred during the 
Iran-Contra trial of Oliver L. North. 
</P>
<P>
 In Clinton's tenure, the most closely watched controversy involved attorney 
general candidates Zoe Baird and Kimba M. Wood. 
</P>
<P>
 Both women lost out over issues surrounding the hiring of household workers 
who were immigrants and whether the nominees had paid Social Security taxes. 
That story was followed closely by 24% of those interviewed.

BAD WHEEL CITED IN CIRCUS TRAIN WRECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Investigators focused on a possible broken wheel in the probe of a Ringling 
Brothers and Barnum & Bailey circus train derailment that killed two 
performers, federal officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "A wheel was possibly involved in the accident.We are attempting to locate as 
many parts of the wheel as possible," said Jim Hall, a spokesman for the 
National Transportation Safety Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Once collected, the pieces of the metal wheel will be sent to the safety board 
laboratory in Washington, D.C., for tests, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 53-car train jumped its tracks Thursday while transporting about 200 
circus performers and a variety of animals to Orlando for performances 
scheduled this weekend. One elephant trainer and a woman who performed as a 
clown died in the wreck. 
</P>
<P>
 Circus officials canceled two performances originally scheduled for today, and 
said they were evaluating the impact of the derailment on their schedule of 
U.S. performances. The circus depends on trains to transport its animals and 
performers to show locations. 
</P>
<P>
 Eyewitnesses said that a wheel apparently flew off one of the cars just before 
the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 A source with the circus, who asked not to be identified, said the train 
continued moving for nearly three miles before the affected car hit a switching 
terminal in the tracks, which may have triggered the derailment.

 Former Atty. Gen. Edwin Meese III announced that he will give up a court 
battle to suppress the Iran-Contra prosecutor's final report, which accuses 
Meese of concocting a false account of a November, 1985, arms-for-hostages 
shipment to Iran by saying President Ronald Reagan had not known about it. 
Calling the conclusions by independent counsel Lawrence E. Walsh "outrageous," 
Meese said through his lawyer that he will "confront Walsh's false statements 
head-on" when the report is released next week.

 An FBI weapon expert describing the firearms found in the Branch Davidian 
compound in Waco said he had never seen so many weapons outside a gun factory. 
James Cadigan, testifying in the federal murder trial of 11 followers of David 
Koresh, told jurors in San Antonio that nearly a quarter of more than 200 
weapons he identified as having been found in the compound were fully 
automatic. Prosecutors, who contend the modified firearms are illegal, estimate 
nearly 400 firearms and more than 1 million rounds of ammunition were found in 
the compound.

<TEXT>

 An appeals court in Philadelphia refused to hear a challenge to the state's 
strict abortion law, making it likely that the law will take effect next 
month.In May, a federal judge stayed the law, saying abortion rights advocates 
deserved a chance to prove that it posed an "undue burden" to women seeking 
abortions. The state appealed to the U.S. 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals. In 
1992, the U.S. Supreme Court upheld the Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act, 
which requires women to receive counseling about alternatives to abortion and 
then wait 24 hours before undergoing the procedure. The law also requires 
unmarried girls younger than 18 to get the permission of their parents before 
obtaining an abortion.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. William F. Weld introduced dramatic welfare-reform legislation to 
eliminate traditional cash grants for able-bodied recipients, using the money 
instead to pay for day care, health care and child support for recipients who 
would then be expected to go to work. Those newly applying for welfare would 
have 90 days to find a job while receiving assistance, after which they would 
be required to perform community service or forfeit their cash benefits. Weld, 
a Republican, said the plan would put up to 50,000 welfare recipients of Aid to 
Families With Dependent Children -- about half the state's total -- to work in 
either private sector or community service jobs over 12 to 15 months.

LYLE MENENDEZ JURY HALTS DELIBERATIONS FOR WEEKEND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN ABRAHAMSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The day after the Erik Menendez jury gave up in frustration and deadlock, the 
Lyle Menendez jury continued deliberations Friday, working through a 22nd day 
with no outward sign of strain. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Erik Menendez jury dismissed, the Lyle Menendez panel took over the 
jury room the other jurors had been using -- right off the fourth-floor 
courtroom. While dozens of reporters buzzed about in a nearby hallway, the jury 
spent the day behind closed doors. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently mindful of the media frenzy that erupted Thursday after the Erik 
Menendez jury deadlock was announced, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Stanley M. 
Weisberg on Friday imposed a gag order on lawyers in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Friday, before the order was issued, defense lawyer Leslie Abramson 
told reporters she was fielding calls from around the nation from people 
interested in contributing to a defense fund for a potential Erik Menendez 
retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 But the gag order cut short Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti's expected comments on 
the case, which had drawn a standing-room-only crowd of reporters to his 
office. "I will stand by my previous comments," Garcetti said -- a reference to 
his vow earlier this week to retry the Menendez brothers for murder if the 
six-month trial produced no verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyle Menendez, 26, and Erik Menendez, 23, admit they shot their father, Jose 
Menendez, 45, a wealthy entertainment executive, and their mother, Kitty 
Menendez, 47, in the TV room of the family's Beverly Hills mansion. 
</P>
<P>
 But they testified that they fired in self-defense after years of emotional 
and sexual abuse. Prosecutors contend that the brothers killed out of hatred 
and greed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two juries heard the case because some evidence was admitted against only one 
brother. Weisberg has given jurors four options for findings in the slaying of 
each Menendez parent, ranging from first-degree murder to involuntary 
manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the Erik Menendez jury, which Thursday sent a third and final 
note to the judge announcing no hope for a verdict after 106 hours of 
deliberations, the Lyle Menendez jury has not sent any note signaling a 
deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lyle Menendez jurors did send a note Thursday asking three questions on 
legal definitions relating to manslaughter. But they asked no questions Friday 
before going home at 4:30 p.m. They will return Tuesday, after the Martin 
Luther King Jr. holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 Though jurors are instructed to ignore news reports on the trial, legal 
experts said it was almost certain that the Lyle Menendez jury knew about the 
mistrial in the younger brother's case. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports of the deadlock in the Erik Menendez jury were "hard to miss," 
dominating news reports, said John D. Gilleland, a Chicago-based psychologist 
with the trial-consulting firm FTI. 
</P>
<P>
 "It tips the scales," Gilleland said. "It's unfortunate. (The jury) may now 
see (deadlock) as an outcome that is acceptable to the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Weisberg scheduled a Feb. 28 hearing to set a new trial date for Erik 
Menendez.

ANTI-GANG COUNSELOR VOWS TO CONTINUE AFTER WOUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A popular anti-gang counselor who had been mediating a war between black and 
Latino gangs in Venice that has left 11 people dead in recent months is 
recovering from a gunshot wound, apparently inflicted by a gang member. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Jimmie Powell, 32, who is a caseworker with the nonprofit 
organization Project Heavy West, was shot in the arm Saturday night as he 
walked near 4th and Vernon avenues in Venice. 
</P>
<P>
 Community activists say the shooting illustrates the danger they encounter in 
trying to broker peace among gangs. Powell, who was released from the hospital 
Tuesday, said Friday that he remains undaunted. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want people to see that I'm not retaliating, that even after being hit, I'm 
still trying to keep the peace," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles police say Powell, who is black, waved at two Latino teen-agers, 
one of whom opened fire. Powell took cover behind a van and was wounded when he 
ran up the street. The attackers fled, said Detective Bernard Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old was arrested Sunday on an unrelated warrant and was linked to 
Powell's shooting as well as to the killing of Sean Patterson, a Venice 
resident with no gang ties who was gunned down in November, Lt. Brad Merritt 
said. The unidentified youth has been charged with attempted murder in the 
Powell shooting and murder in the Patterson shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Singleton, a Project Heavy West case manager, said that within 15 
minutes of the Powell shooting, the youth who allegedly shot Powell called 
Project Heavy West and left a stream of expletives on the answering machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Singleton recognized the voice and turned the tape over to police. ADRIAN

COURT TO REVIVE ISSUE OF LARGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES; LAW: THE JUSTICES HAVE 
STRUGGLED WITH RECENT RULINGS ON AWARDS THAT FAR EXCEED ACTUAL LOSSES. THIS 
CASE INVOLVES A $5-MILLION JUDGMENT AGAINST HONDA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID G. SAVAGE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Supreme Court announced Friday that it would once again consider the 
constitutionality of a huge award of punitive damages, this time $5 million to 
an Oregon man who was badly injured when his Honda all-terrain vehicle 
overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, expected by summer, likely will confirm that lower court judges 
must review punitive verdicts to ensure that they are not excessive. 
</P>
<P>
 That alone would be an important victory for business lawyers, but it would 
not necessarily change the practice in most states. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike in other states, the Oregon Supreme Court has said that it will not 
reduce a punitive damages verdict as long as the jurors were properly 
instructed that such an award should be imposed only for "wanton and willful 
wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 In two recent decisions, the U.S. Supreme Court has suggested that state 
judges must carefully review large punitive verdicts. 
</P>
<P>
 In their appeals, lawyers for Honda said that the hands-off approach adopted 
by the Oregon courts violated the company's right to due process of law. By 
agreeing to hear the case (Honda Motor Corp. vs. Oberg, 93-644), the high court 
renewed a nearly decade-long legal struggle over the constitutionality of 
punitive damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the court, led by Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, are 
convinced that punitive damages should be reined in. But a majority has been 
unable to agree on a formula.  
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they voted to uphold multimillion-dollar punitive verdicts in 1989, 
1991 and 1993, leading to predictions among some corporate attorneys that 
Congress or the state legislatures would have to handle the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike compensatory damages, which repay victims for their losses, punitive 
damages are intended to punish a malicious or deceitful company. In product 
liability cases, however, these damages also have been awarded in the case of 
injuries caused by products that were poorly designed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oregon case began when Karl Oberg tried to ride his three-wheeled vehicle 
up a steep embankment. The 325-pound machine flipped over backward and fell on 
Oberg. He suffered broken facial bones and some brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury awarded him $735,000 in compensatory damages and tacked on $5 million 
to punish Honda for a "wanton disregard for the health and safety" of its 
customers. The company's lawyers said that the punitive award should be 
overturned as unfair and unjustified. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other appeals were granted during an unusual Friday afternoon orders list 
as the court agreed to decide: 
</P>
<P>
 * Whether a state can restrict an accountant's right to advertise her 
expertise (Ibanez vs. Florida, 93-639). Although the high court has said that 
lawyers and accountants have a free-speech right to advertise, Florida law has 
prohibited such ads and the Florida courts upheld a sanction against a 
lawyer-accountant who advertised her specialized training.  
</P>
<P>
 * Whether the government can force coal operators to pay black-lung benefits 
to former miners when it is not clear that mining caused their lung problems 
(Labor Department vs. Greenwich Collieries, 93-744).

CLINTON AIDE APPOINTED TO TRY TO RESTART SMOG TALKS; NEGOTIATIONS: WHITE HOUSE 
INTERVENES TO GET THE EPA AND STATE OFFICIALS BACK TO WORK ON A COMPROMISE TO 
REFORM THE SYSTEM.

 The White House acted Friday to end the impasse between California and the 
federal Environmental Protection Administration over reform of vehicle smog 
checks by ordering a top environmental official to try to fashion a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the White House point of view, we just want to see the Legislature pass 
a law that meets the requirements of the Clean Air Act and the sooner the 
better," said Tom Epstein, special assistant to the President for political 
affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein said Mary Nichols, EPA assistant administrator for air and radiation, 
will attempt to bring the two sides together Tuesday when she visits 
Sacramento.  
</P>
<P>
 Nichols, a longtime smog fighter and a Californian, said that although no 
meetings with legislators and Wilson Administration officials had been 
arranged, she will try to restart the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've put out a whole series of options and there are ways to mix and match 
the various elements," she said. "(But) the program that California starts has 
to be done in a timely manner and it has to clean up the air." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiations between state representatives over how best to overhaul the 
state's automobile Smog Check program and bring California into compliance with 
federal clean air standards collapsed Jan. 7. Each side blamed the other. 
</P>
<P>
 Epstein, President's Clinton's adviser on California political issues, said 
the White House got involved because "this is a very high-profile issue between 
California and the federal government." 
</P>
<P>
 State Senate leader David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), who spoke privately with 
White House officials in trying to break the impasse, said they made clear that 
they are "interested in compromise." 
</P>
<P>
 The extra attention to California occurs at a time when economic recovery of 
the state is a high priority with Clinton and his reelection strategists. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, the same 9,000 service stations and garages that inspect 
vehicles also make emission system repairs, an arrangement that critics say can 
result in dirtier air. The federal EPA favors separating the two functions. 
</P>
<P>
 But service station operators and their supporters assert that the EPA program 
would not assure higher quality air but would run them out of business and 
trigger the loss of about 18,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The state is threatened with an annual loss of about $800 million in U.S. 
transportation funds this spring if an agreement cannot be reached. Also, if 
California does not overhaul its Smog Check program, tighter clean air 
standards could be imposed on other sources of pollution, including industrial 
plants. 
</P>
<P>
 California negotiators claim that the EPA effectively broke off talks with the 
announcement Jan. 7 that sanctions would be imposed unless an acceptable smog 
check law was enacted by the Legislature. EPA officials denied that they quit 
the negotiations, saying they merely started the countdown and wanted talks to 
continue. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, the Legislature dusted off a major smog reform bill that had been 
parked since last summer and began pushing it toward the desk of Gov. Pete 
Wilson, who has said he would sign it. EPA officials said the proposal fell far 
short of meeting federal Clean Air Act requirements, a claim denied by its 
supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the bill would authorize random roadside testing of 
exhaust emissions, require more training of mechanics, impose stiffer civil and 
criminal penalties for fraud and ban "gross" emitting vehicles from highways. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson called the bipartisan bill a "common-sense solution that will address 
air quality but do so in a way that will not impose intolerable burdens on 
California motorists." 
</P>
<P>
 The bill by Sen. Newton Russell (R-Glendale) was derailed briefly this week by 
opponent Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), but is scheduled to be debated by 
the Senate on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden told the Rules Committee on Friday that although the bill contains many 
improvements, it does not meet federal standards and would prolong the 
controversy without cleaning the air. "We are only digging a hole to bury 
ourselves in by the passage of this bill," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar), a lead California negotiator who believes 
that the bill would meet or exceed federal standards, said if negotiations are 
to be resumed, the "EPA has to put something new on the table and show some 
flexibility."

AQMD MOVES ITS RIDE-SHARING RULE TO THE BACK SEAT; SMOG: AIR QUALITY BOARD 
CREATES A NEW TASK FORCE TO FIND NEW WAYS TO REDUCE SOLO COMMUTING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving toward overhauling one of its most far-reaching and unpopular efforts 
to combat smog, the Southland's air quality board on Friday formed a task force 
to search for new ways to remove solo commuters from the region's roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the South Coast Air Quality Management District board was 
applauded by many businesses that have complained for years that they have 
unfairly had to shoulder the burden of trying to revolutionize the way Southern 
Californians commute. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to forming the task force, the board voted to allow businesses to 
delay implementing new ride-sharing incentives as long as they still meet their 
current goals. The agency's enforcement staff also was directed to issue 
warning notices -- instead of imposing fines -- when businesses do not fulfill 
ride-sharing requirements, unless the violations are "clearly flagrant." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the AQMD's ride-share rule adopted six years ago, companies in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties with more than 100 
employees must establish programs that encourage employees to car-pool, take 
mass transit or use other means of getting to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Covering 5,200 companies with 1.3 million employees, the groundbreaking rule 
has been one of the AQMD's most ambitious efforts to fight smog. Its goal is to 
increase rush-hour ridership to an average of 1.5 people per car. To comply, 
companies must subsidize train and bus tickets for employees, form van pools 
and offer free parking or other incentives to car-poolers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule has been unpopular because thousands of offices and other 
non-industrial businesses must spend large amounts of money to create elaborate 
ride-share plans. Collectively, employers in the four-county area spend about 
$160 million a year on the programs, according to one recent study done for the 
AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD's effort to revamp its program will be monitored nationally because 
dozens of other smoggy cities have begun to model ride-sharing regulations on 
Southern California's. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD Board Chairman Henry W. Wedaa, who spearheaded the effort to review the 
regulation, said the new task force will face the challenge of coming up with 
less costly and onerous ways to persuade commuters to leave their cars at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the task force will be appointed by the AQMD board. Its size and 
makeup has yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 But a number of ideas for revamping the program have surfaced. Among them is 
setting auto registration fees according to the number of miles driven, or 
charging motorists for driving during peak traffic hours. Such efforts, 
however, would require new state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa stressed that the AQMD cannot abandon or weaken the program because 
state and federal laws require the agency to remove a large number of cars from 
Southland roads by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not scaling it back. I am not a supporter of that," said Wedaa, a 
Yorba Linda city councilman. "But I am a supporter of supplying more options to 
obtain the same goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Before voting unanimously for the task force, several board members advocated 
rescinding the ride-share regulation completely. Its strongest critic on the 
board is Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich, who called it an 
excessive case of "Big Brother" government imposing its will on private 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Other board members, however, hailed the regulation as an efficient and 
relatively inexpensive way to reduce smog. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we going to substitute instead? What is the cost to society . . . if 
we scrap this program entirely?" asked AQMD board member and Los Angeles City 
Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
 Although AQMD staff members acknowledge that the ride-share rule is unwieldy 
and time-consuming for businesses, they say it has been one of the most 
effective methods of reducing smog-causing emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The average number of riders per car has increased to 1.24 from 1.13 when the 
program was adopted in 1987, according to the AQMD. During that time, the 
agency estimates that 11 million one-way trips per year have been eliminated in 
the four counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics among business leaders and government officials have condemned it 
as a costly attempt at social engineering that is bound to fail because so many 
Southland residents depend on their cars.

150 TEACHERS PROTEST OVER STALLED TALKS; COLLEGES: MANDATORY STAFF MEETINGS ON 
THE VENTURA, MOORPARK AND OXNARD CAMPUSES ARE BOYCOTTED BY SOME FACULTY 
MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 About 150 teachers at Ventura County's three community colleges boycotted 
mandatory staff meetings Friday morning to gather in outdoor protests and vent 
their frustration over stalled contract negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The boycott of the twice-annual President's Hour was not honored by all the 
colleges' teachers, though some instructors who attended the official meeting 
said they sympathized with the protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 At Ventura College, nearly 100 faculty members refused to attend college 
President Jesus Carreon's meeting, leaving fewer than 25 teachers, the college 
president, other administrators and some office staff members inside a sparsely 
filled auditorium.  
</P>
<P>
 At Moorpark College, most teachers attended the meeting held by President Jim 
Walker, saying they did not want to offend the campus' popular president. Only 
about 30 of nearly 150 full-time faculty members boycotted the meeting. Some of 
the instructors wandered between the two gatherings. 
</P>
<P>
 At Oxnard College, about 20 teachers attended the protest, leaving about 30 to 
attend the official meeting. The rest of the 78 full-time faculty members 
avoided the dilemma by not showing up or calling in sick, faculty members said. 
</P>
<P>
 The President's Hour is a gathering of each college's entire staff during 
which the president gives staff members an update on the state of the college 
and news from the district office. 
</P>
<P>
 If contract negotiations remain stalled through the end of the month, many 
teachers said they would support a districtwide walkout Feb. 1 and picket 
college district headquarters that night as board members arrive for their 
monthly board meeting.  
</P>
<P>
 "We are being realistic in what we are asking for," said Barbara Hoffman, 
teachers' union president and a counselor at Ventura College. "It has been 
since 1990 since you got a raise. We want to continue to turn up the heat!" she 
told the group of protesting teachers at Ventura College. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers' union and the district have been at an impasse over the 
teachers' 1993-94 contract negotiations since early fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The teachers, who have not received a raise since the 1990-91 school year, are 
asking for a cost-of-living adjustment and a 3% salary raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet college district leaders want to keep salaries at their present levels 
while asking teachers to contribute more to the cost of their health benefits 
and make other concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can demand and demand and demand, but they don't have to be responsible 
for a balanced budget," said district board President Allan Jacobs, with a 
touch of exasperation in his voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacobs, like other board members and administrators, said he is "empathetic" 
to the faculty's grievances. But he said the district must first find out if 
state leaders in Sacramento plan further cuts to community college budgets 
before negotiators can make a deal with teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our board is very adamant that until we know there is enough money in the 
budget to do something, we're not going to do anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers say they are getting tired of waiting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our morale is low," said Diane Lopez, a Moorpark College English teacher. "We 
feel we are not respected." 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Rithner, a Ventura College English teacher, said he has never seen such 
frustration and low morale among instructors in the 45 years he has taught at 
the college. Not only are faculty members upset with the college board of 
trustees, he said, but they're also fed up with college district 
administrators. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't trust the central administration of the district," Rithner said. "I 
feel they treat the faculty with contempt." 
</P>
<P>
 Rithner said a walkout "is not my kind of thing," but he added that given the 
way things are going he might join one for the first time in his career.  
</P>
<P>
 Many faculty members say the stalled salary negotiations are only the most 
galling symptom of a larger problem: that district administrators and board 
members seem to care more about finances than education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Education should be the No. 1 priority in the district. Right now education 
is the least important thing," said David Murphy, a Moorpark College chemistry 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, Murphy said, Moorpark College cut back on pay for substitute 
instructors, forcing his class to go without a teacher when he was sick last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, the Moorpark College English teacher, said she is disheartened by the 
district's neglect of its computers. Often, she said, there are not enough 
computers for students during a writing course she teaches, or the computers 
are too old. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators and board members vociferously disagree that education is a 
secondary consideration. The problem, they say, is that teachers have no idea 
of the district's tough financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there's some money somewhere, we would like them to show us where it is," 
said Jeff Marsee, the district's vice chancellor for administrative services. 
"We wish we had a solution. We really do. There just isn't enough money to go 
around."

OXNARD TO HONOR KING WITH PARADE, OBSERVANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Making Martin Luther King Jr.'s dream of a racially integrated society come 
alive will be the theme Monday of a parade and observance in Oxnard marking the 
slain civil rights leader's birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Other observances start today -- which is actually King's birthday. But 
Monday's King Birthday Celebration and Brunch, sponsored by the Martin Luther 
King Committee of Ventura County, will be the most visible Ventura County event 
to honor King and comes on the federal holiday named in his honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers expect more than 1,000 people to attend Monday's eighth annual 
parade and observance in Oxnard in honor of King, the Baptist minister and 
civil rights leader who preached nonviolence as a way to overcome prejudice. 
</P>
<P>
 Also celebrating Martin Luther King Jr. Day will be Ventura Harbor Village in 
Ventura, which will host jazz, gospel and blues concerts today through Monday, 
as well as an African-American art show and poetry readings. 
</P>
<P>
 The concerts, featuring the Ventura County Mass Choir and jazz and blues 
artists Henry Franklin, Jim Calire and John Marx, will be held from noon to 4 
p.m. all three days at 1559 Spinnaker Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The art exhibit, which will include African pottery, sculpture, paintings, 
drawings and jewelry, will be open from 11 a.m. to 5 p.m. through Monday at 
1583 Spinnaker Drive. Poet Daisy Cotton will give readings and orator Mikki 
Bouchard will dramatize the "I Have a Dream" speech that King delivered at the 
1963 march on Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 King, who would have celebrated his 65th birthday today, organized the 
Southern Christian Leadership Conference and led numerous marches to protest 
racial separation and prejudice. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1964. 
</P>
<P>
 King was assassinated in April, 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Monday's observance, local religious leaders, public officials and 
admirers of King will march from Oxnard's Plaza Park to the civic auditorium in 
tribute to the 1965 "freedom march" that King led from Selma to Montgomery, 
Ala. The march will begin at 8:30 a.m. at Plaza Park, at 5th and C streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Gwen Moore (D-Los Angeles) will deliver the keynote address at 
the observance, which will be held at 9 a.m. at the Oxnard Civic Auditorium, 
800 Hobson Way. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore, who was a leader in the campaign to recognize King with a state 
holiday, said she met the civil rights leader while a student at Cal State Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Ordered by her sorority sisters to get 10 of King's autographs in Alpha Kappa 
Alpha's pink and green colors, Moore said she met with King, who graciously 
complied. The only problem was her sorority sisters did not believe that 
someone of King's stature had honored the frivolous request and destroyed the 
autographs, she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just didn't believe me," Moore said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But Moore said the meeting helped inspire a lifelong commitment to civil 
rights. "I was taken with his commitment to involve and empower the people," 
Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The observance will also feature the music of the Martin Luther King Choir, a 
countywide choral group, and the interdenominational Ventura County Mass Choir. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Jackson, an Oxnard College administrator and a member of the King 
committee, said it is important for Americans to understand what King stood 
for. 
</P>
<P>
 "King believed that the integrity of each person does not depend on the color 
of his skin, but the content of his character," Jackson said. "In today's 
contemporary American society, we need to remember that." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Supervisor John K. Flynn, who will participate in Monday's 
parade and observance, also emphasized the importance of King's message. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martin Luther King helped transform this nation," Flynn said. "He did it with 
nonviolence -- and that's what is especially important to us." 
</P>
<P>
 A brunch will be served in the civic auditorium's Oxnard Room after Monday's 
observance. Tickets at $6.50 can be reserved by calling 486-2424. FYI 
</P>
<P>
 City, county, state and federal offices will be closed Monday in honor of 
Martin Luther King Jr. No mail will be delivered. Banks will be closed, but 
many retail businesses, including grocery stores, will open.

ATTACKS THAT BOMBED OCCURRED 49 YEARS AGO; WORLD WAR II: EXPLOSIVES BORNE BY 
PAPER BALLOONS DRIFTED ALL THE WAY FROM JAPAN TO VENTURA COUNTY, BUT CAUSED NO 
DAMAGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't exactly a day of infamy in Ventura County -- hardly anyone knew what 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 But 49 years ago today -- Jan. 15, 1945 -- the winds of war brought the first 
of up to three spectacularly unsuccessful and almost unnoticed Japanese 
assaults on Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks were carried out not by enemy submarines, or even by long-distance 
bombers. These bombs came by balloon -- paper balloons -- sent all the way from 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for putting up some defensive gun emplacements, Ventura County saw 
little action for most of World War II. But in the early part of 1945, Fugo 
balloon bomb attacks were recorded in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The first created a crater in the dry bed of the Santa Clara River near 
Saticoy on Jan. 15. Two days later, an entire balloon was found in Moorpark, 
still containing untriggered incendiary bombs but missing the 33-pound 
anti-personnel bomb carried by the balloons. Remnants of a third balloon bomb 
were found Feb. 21 in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloon found in Moorpark may have been the same one that dropped the 
explosive on the Santa Clara riverbed, according to Richard Senate, a Thousand 
Oaks-based historian who specializes in Ventura County's past. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's probably the only time anyone could actually say that the war came to 
Ventura County," Senate said. "These balloons were very ingeniously designed 
devices on the drawing board. Luckily for us, they didn't perform well in real 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese attack on the county wasn't revealed at the time, Senate and 
others said. Local news media agreed with government officials to squelch 
reporting of the incident to prevent the Japanese from knowing whether their 
unassuming weapons actually made it to American shores. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't until 1947 did we see any kind of news reports about the balloons," 
Senate said. "By then, people were getting on with their lives and didn't 
really seem to care too much about the incident." 
</P>
<P>
 No other landings in Southern California were recorded, although remnants of a 
balloon were found floating about 60 miles west of San Pedro. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloons, about 70 feet high and 30 feet in diameter, were first launched 
from Japan in November, 1944. The idea, according to Tom Crouch, chairman of 
the Smithsonian Institution's Department of Aeronautics in Washington, was to 
start hundreds of forest fires in California and throughout the Pacific 
Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to ride the swift west-to-east high-altitude jet stream, the 
estimated 10,000 balloons launched by the Japanese army malfunctioned by the 
hundreds. Crouch said it's possible that only one in 10 of the devices made it 
across the Pacific, to places as far-flung as Alaska and Mexico. An estimated 
355 of the airborne bombs were credited with reaching U.S. territory, some 
getting as far inland as Michigan and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted to set the Northwest on fire," Crouch said. "It was a desperation 
move. They wanted to strike back at us for our aerial bombing raids." 
</P>
<P>
 Both Crouch and Bert Webber, an Oregon-based historian who has written four 
books on the subject, agree that the balloon launches were one of the last 
gasps of the weakened Japanese war machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber said that despite their designers' intention of wreaking wide 
devastation, the bombs are known to have caused only six fatalities among U.S. 
civilians. On May 5, 1945, a woman and five children on a church picnic in 
Oregon became the only known victims when they approached a downed balloon and 
its 33-pound bomb exploded unexpectedly. 
</P>
<P>
 The balloons themselves were made of paper and glued together with potato 
paste. The air envelope was filled with hydrogen and an elaborate system of 
ballast weights linked to a barometer managed the device in flight. 
</P>
<P>
 When the balloon would lose altitude, Webber said, a small explosive device -- 
about the size of a shotgun shell -- would fire and a ballast weight would be 
released, allowing the balloon to resume its normal operating altitude -- about 
38,000 feet. A typical crossing took two to three days, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Webber said the balloon bomb attacks would have been stepped up by the 
Japanese had the American forces not started even more intensive aerial bombing 
over Japan with B-29 Superfortress bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's evidence indicating that they were ready to launch even larger 
balloons with larger bomb loads," Webber said. "What stopped them was our B-29 
raids over Japan. It literally crushed their ability to make the things." 
</P>
<P>
 For Senate, however, the balloon bombs -- despite their significant failure 
rate -- showed the resourcefulness of the Japanese military. 
</P>
<P>
 "They used Japanese schoolgirls to construct these things using non-strategic 
materials such as paper and potato paste," Senate said. "For very little money 
they were essentially making unguided missiles."

'93 FELONIES: SOME GOOD AND BAD NEWS; CRIME: VIOLENCE ROSE IN SANTA PAULA, AND 
PORT HUENEME HOMICIDES NEARED RECORD. YET OVERALL PICTURE WAS IMPROVED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Violent crime in 1993 reached its highest level in six years in Santa Paula, 
while Port Hueneme had a near-record number of homicides, according to crime 
statistics released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But the overall number of crimes in both cities was down -- dramatically so in 
Port Hueneme -- even though each town's small police force has been burdened by 
ever-tighter budgets and increasing demands for its services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We definitely feel underfunded and understaffed, considering the growth of 
the city," said Chief Walt Adair of the Santa Paula Police Department. "We've 
already had to discontinue some services we provided to the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Paula's crime rate for 1993 is again expected to be second only to 
Oxnard among Ventura County cities, Adair said. Robberies increased by 24% and 
assaults jumped by 47%, according to his department's figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge jump in assaults was due to the department's decision to include 
domestic violence cases for the first time in that crime category, Adair said. 
Domestic violence had previously been a separate category. 
</P>
<P>
 "Still, we're concerned over the increase in violent crime," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet the increasing demands on police, the department has applied for a 
federal grant similar to one awarded to Fillmore a few weeks ago. The $300,000 
grant sought from the Justice Department would be used to hire three additional 
officers for three years. The city will learn if the grant is approved in the 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 The department is also depending on a new citizens' patrol formed this month 
to offset increased demands for services, Adair said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we can concentrate on stopping graffiti and on burglary, the police can 
concentrate on other things," said Huguette Johnson, who helped form the 
citizens' patrol with her husband, Don. "It saddens me to see the statistics. 
It's not good for our image or property values." 
</P>
<P>
 Others in the city say crime rates will remain high, no matter the number of 
police, if social problems are not addressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trying to make law enforcement responsible for the year-to-year changes in 
crime just isn't realistic," said City Councilwoman Margaret Ely. "Simply 
responding with more police is an easy answer for people because it removes the 
responsibility away from them. They don't have to do anything. We're trying to 
change that by being better neighbors in Santa Paula." 
</P>
<P>
 In Port Hueneme, the city has seen a 36% drop in crime despite cutbacks in the 
city's police force. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a surprise to me," said Chief John Hopkins. "I'm happy and I'd like to 
say that the decrease was due to the aggressive work of our officers, but I 
don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 In January of last year, the department cut three positions, dropping the 
force to just 19 officers. The cut was felt acutely, Hopkins said, when police 
were faced with three homicides in three months. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we had the three women killed back-to-back, that just about overwhelmed 
us," Hopkins said. "We've caught up, though. We're able to deal with the cuts." 
</P>
<P>
 The five slayings in Port Hueneme last year were just one shy of the city 
record, which was set in the 1970s, Hopkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 Longtime council member Dorill Wright said the murder toll was way outside the 
norm. Hopkins agreed but said that, overall, the news was good. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his department, like Santa Paula's, is meeting demands through 
innovative programs like citizen patrols. He speculated that the patrols may 
have contributed to the 37% drop in burglaries.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've had a lot of interest in the Neighborhood Watch programs this year -- a 
lot of community help," said Hopkins. "It seemed to make a difference, but all 
we know for sure is the number went down." Crime in Port Hueneme, Santa Paula

SCHOOLS LOOK INTO OUSTING GANGBANGERS; THOUSAND OAKS: BOARD VENTURES INTO 
UNKNOWN LEGAL TERRITORY IN EXPLORING THE POSSIBILITY OF EXPULSIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks school officials plan to explore the possibility of identifying 
gang members so they could be expelled because of their gang connections. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that a "slowly creeping climate" of danger threatens student safety, 
board member Richard Newman said gang members are by nature violent and pose a 
threat to other students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there is an innocuous, well-meaning gang member in our town," 
Newman told his colleagues on the Conejo Valley Unified School District board 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, to legally bar students from school for gang affiliation -- not 
specific behavior -- would probably require passage of a new state law, said 
William L. Rukeyser, a spokesman for the state Department of Education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even then, it would almost undoubtedly be subject to judicial review," 
Rukeyser said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is new territory," agreed Conejo Valley Supt. Jerry Gross. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal was not on Thursday's agenda, but Newman raised the issue after 
board members approved a policy allowing principals to define and prohibit gang 
clothing in their schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said Friday that he suspects there will be legal issues surrounding his 
proposal. But he raised the point as a way to begin discussion about what the 
district should do to stop the spread of gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 "For us to wait for a catastrophe to occur, and then react, is the wrong thing 
to do," said Newman, a retired Simi Valley police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Dolores Didio asked Gross to explore the idea and return with 
more information. Although she questioned the legal implications, Didio 
expressed sympathy with Newman's motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that all of us are grappling with what we can do to 
prevent the further growth of gangs in this community," Didio said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gross said he would get an opinion from the school district's attorney and 
discuss it with police officials well-versed in the gang culture of Ventura 
County. But on its face, the proposal raises concerns, Gross said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like when somebody says, 'I'm going to commit suicide.' What do you do? 
Lock them up for the rest of their life?" Gross said. "It's a real tricky 
issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the legal issues, such a policy could create a backlash if most of the 
students expelled were minorities, said Robert J. Meadows, an associate 
professor in the sociology and criminology department at Cal Lutheran 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea is, if they haven't done anything, where do you draw the line? You 
don't want to label somebody for something they haven't done," Meadows said. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Uelmen, Conejo Valley teachers' union president, a social studies 
teacher at Newbury Park High School, agreed with Newman that gang members are 
troublemakers and should be removed from campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as I'm concerned, safety should be the No. 1 priority, and 
constitutional issues would have to be second," Uelmen said.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; MASTERMIND OF FATAL THEFT PLOT 
SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mastermind of a robbery plot that led to the shooting death of Port 
Hueneme landlord was sentenced to 25 years to life in prison Friday by a judge 
who called the defendant a sophisticated criminal. 
</P>
<P>
 George Pena, 23, of Oxnard was found guilty of first-degree murder on Nov. 9, 
but he was exonerated of a special allegation that could have put him in prison 
for life without possibility of parole. 
</P>
<P>
 He and three other suspects were charged in the case of Richard Schell, a 
52-year-old Santa Barbara man who was fatally shot Dec. 1, 1992, after 
collecting rent from tenants in a Port Hueneme apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 Schell died of a single gunshot wound that tore into his shoulder and passed 
through his heart. The robbers fled after the shooting, leaving behind $2,000 
in cash in Schell's truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Bryant A. Villagran said his client was remorseful and 
understood the gravity of his actions. He said the case deserved less than a 
25-years-to-life sentence, calling it "overkill for Mr. Pena." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a just and appropriate sentence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Donald C. Glynn disagreed. "Had it not been for Mr. Pena in 
organizing this robbery, the robbery would not have happened," Glynn said. 
</P>
<P>
 In handing down the sentence, Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath said 
Pena planned the robbery for a month before recruiting his three co-defendants 
to join the plot. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Pena's co-defendants, 16-year-old Gilbert Martinez, was convicted of 
attempted robbery and sentenced to seven years in juvenile detention. 
</P>
<P>
 The other two were convicted of first-degree murder. Jose Luis Arreguin, 20, 
received life in prison without parole. David Soto, also 20, is scheduled to be 
sentenced Jan. 20. DWAYNE BRAY

<P>
 The owner of Noren's Market, one of the few neighborhood grocery stores in 
Ventura, has announced that she is negotiating with buyers to take over her 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a dinosaur.We don't do enough business," said Peggy Carr, who has owned 
the store for more than three years. "Everyone goes to the big clubs." 
</P>
<P>
 Carr said most of her customers come in to purchase only a few things and do 
the bulk of their grocery shopping at supermarkets. The market offers fresh and 
dry goods, and its meat selection in particular has attracted a faithful group 
of customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr declined to give details of her negotiations with two potential buyers 
but said the sale may be closed as quickly as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she has been losing money on the store and has been trying to sell 
the 39-year-old market on Telegraph Road for six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Carr said she did not know what would happen to her store after she sold it. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're grocery-store people, so I'm sure it will continue to be a grocery 
store," she said. PEGGY Y. LEE

 An Oxnard man pleaded innocent Friday to the Christmas Day stabbing of his 
ex-girlfriend's son. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Municipal Judge Bruce A. Clark continued bail at $250,000 for 
32-year-old Jose Socorro Jimenez. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark also set a preliminary hearing for Feb. 9 to determine whether Jimenez 
will stand trial on the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said Jimenez stabbed 21-year-old Isaias Guerrero after showing up at 
the family's Campbell Way home about 3 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the stabbing, the victim had tried to get Jimenez off the family's 
property, witnesses said. Jimenez had smashed his hand against a living-room 
window, yelling that the victim's mother, 36-year-old Graciela Guerrero, was 
"going to pay" for breaking off their three-year relationship. 
</P>
<P>
 An earlier arraignment scheduled for Jimenez had been postponed. DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; LACEY LETTER URGES HALT OF RADAR PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY SAILLANT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supervisor Susan Lacey has sent a letter to U.S. Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, 
urging him to use his clout to halt construction of a National Weather Service 
radar tower on Sulphur Mountain near Ojai. 
</P>
<P>
 The tower "dominates the landscape of this otherwise beautiful rural 
residential area," Lacey said in the letter sent Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey also raised concerns about the health risk of long-term exposure because 
of the levels of radiation the radar antenna will emit. Opponents of the radar 
system have said they are worried about the possible adverse health effects of 
such exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 "This uncertainty and risk have substantially compromised the residents' 
enjoyment of their homes," Lacey said in the letter. 
</P>
<P>
 Many opponents of the project live near the tower, situated on a ridge along 
Sulphur Mountain Road. The tower site lies within Lacey's supervisorial 
district. 
</P>
<P>
 Lacey suggested that the radar tower be relocated to another, less-populated 
ridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather service wants to install the Doppler radar system to improve 
forecasting for Southern California. Weather service scientists have said the 
low-level, non-ionized radiation from the tower will pose no significant threat 
to the health of those who live nearby. KAY SAILLANT

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; ENVIRONMENTAL CLUB WINS STATE AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A group of environmental-minded students at St. Bonaventure High School in 
Ventura has won state honors for its efforts to reduce waste at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The Environmental Club was named the 1993 winner in the Waste Reduction Awards 
Program, presented by the California Integrated Waste Management Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the club began three years ago, students have set up a classroom paper 
recycling program, which diverts two tons per year from the area landfill. They 
also provide collection boxes to recycle aluminum cans and are setting up a 
composting bin. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't recycle stuff, it just goes to the landfill and it's not good 
for the environment," said Kim Carson, a senior from Santa Paula who is the 
club's secretary this year. "Recycling is like second-nature to me now. I just 
can't throw things away; I have to find a recycling bin." 
</P>
<P>
 The club began in 1991 with nine members and has grown to 61 members, a large 
club for the small private school, said Brandon Roth, an English teacher who 
serves as club adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 The students received a plaque from the state's top waste board. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited about this award because it shows what can be done with a lot 
of enthusiasm and ideas and very little expense," Roth said. "We're hoping the 
recognition encourages other kids at other schools to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 He said diverting the paper and other products from the landfill is an 
excellent way to help the environment. But more important, he said, is the 
education the students get about the need for recycling. 
</P>
<P>
 "This makes an impression on them that they will carry with them when they 
leave the school," he said. "Think about all the stuff that they will recycle 
over the years. Today's youth will carry it on." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Councilman Gary Tuttle, who was a speaker at the ceremony when the 
students launched the program three years ago, praised the students for their 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm encouraged to see environmental principles picked up by youth today, who 
will, of course, be tomorrow's leaders," he said. JOANNA M. MILLER

 Employees at the unemployment offices in Ventura and Oxnard were alerted by 
police Friday about a potential copycat gunman who threatened to shoot 
employees and police officers, a Ventura police spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 37-year-old Ventura man had reportedly made threats that he wanted to 
imitate slain gunman Alan Winterbourne by attacking employees at the 
unemployment offices, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man, who was recently fired from a job at Ventura Community College, was 
arrested by the Ventura Police Department and taken to the county mental health 
hospital for 72-hour observation, the spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura unemployment office closed Friday afternoon as a precaution and 
the Oxnard office was put on alert with a police car stationed in the rear of 
the building, said Vickie Lopez, an employee at the Oxnard office. 
</P>
<P>
 One employee who had been on disability leave returned to the Oxnard office on 
Friday for the first time since the Alan Winterbourne shooting spree, Lopez 
said. She left the office shaken, unable to complete her work, Lopez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state police officer was supposed to leave today and they decided to keep 
him another week. But what then? What's to keep a copycat like this guy from 
getting us? We're like scapegoats for people frustrated with not finding a 
job." SCOTT HADLY

<P>
 An 88-year-old Oxnard woman who died after crashing her car into a parked 
vehicle was identified as Gladys Elfrink, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Elfrink had just stopped by her doctor's office Thursday to make an 
appointment when she suddenly swerved into a parked car in the 900 block of 
West Fifth Street.When rescue workers arrived, Elfrink was unconscious inside 
her car but had no visible injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 She was transported to St. John's Regional Medical Center but never regained 
consciousness and was pronounced dead at 3:15 p.m., said Zelmira Isaac, a 
deputy coroner. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Elfrink had a history of heart trouble, doctors suspected she had 
suffered a heart attack inside her car. But an autopsy performed Friday showed 
that she died of chest injuries from the impact of the crash, Isaac said. JULIE

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: PORT HUENEME; VISITING WARSHIP TO BE OPEN FOR TOURS 
</P>

<P>
 One of the U.S. Navy's most technologically advanced warships will be docking 
in Port Hueneme today and open for public viewing today and Sunday, port 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego-based Merrill, a Spruance-class destroyer, just completed a 
15-month overhaul of its weapons systems, and Navy officials said they will 
begin training sailors to use the weapons during the next two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Navy traditionally opens such ships to the public so people can view the 
new weapons and meet the sailors who will be operating them, said Teri Reid, 
assistant public affairs officer for the Port Hueneme Division of the Naval 
Surface Warfare Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't get very many ships in here for open house, so this is usually an 
exciting event," Reid said. "And this particular ship has the latest, 
state-of-the-art equipment." 
</P>
<P>
 Reid said the Merrill is the first ship to visit the port for testing since 
July, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 After two weeks, the ship will set out to sea to conduct exercises and 
test-fire the new weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 Visiting hours are from 1 to 4 p.m. today and Sunday. People wishing to tour 
the ship should enter the Port Hueneme Naval Warfare Center at the Pleasant 
Valley Gate. For more information, call 982-8014. MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: OXNARD MAN TO OPPOSE GALLEGLY FOR GOP NOD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 William Clifford Winter, an Oxnard resident and former Navy Seabee stationed 
at Port Hueneme, announced Friday he will challenge Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi 
Valley) for the Republican nomination in a congressional district that 
stretches across the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter, 37, said his views calling for an open border between the United 
States and Mexico make him "more representative" of the people of Ventura 
County than Gallegly, who favors a more restrictive immigration policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Congressman Gallegly is way out in left field on immigration," Winter 
said Friday. "He wants to change the Constitution and blockade the borders." 
</P>
<P>
 Winter also favors a proposal to allow commercial airlines to share the runway 
at the Naval Air Station at Point Mugu. And he said he will work to prevent the 
county's military bases from closing. 
</P>
<P>
 Gallegly said he recently met with Winter, who was far more supportive of the 
congressman's record. "He told me when he came to visit me that he supported 
everything I was doing and promised to support me after the primary." 
</P>
<P>
 But responding to his initial comments, Gallegly said, "Obviously we disagree 
on the immigration issue." 
</P>
<P>
 Winter's political experience includes an unsuccessful bid in 1992 for Oxnard 
City Council. Born in Jacksonville, Fla., Winter grew up in New Jersey, the son 
of a hardware store owner. He came to the Naval Construction Battalion Center 
at Port Hueneme in 1987 during his second four-year stint with the Navy. He 
received an honorable discharge in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter said he holds an associate's degree from the University of Maine and a 
bachelor of arts in communications from San Francisco State University. 
</P>
<P>
 Winter, who lists his profession as journalist and free-lance writer, said he 
worked briefly for the Navy in public relations after his discharge. Since 
then, he said, he worked as a nursing assistant in several locations and now 
works for a temporary employment agency in customer service for computers.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; PONY LEAGUE GETS OK TO BUILD FIELD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks school officials have approved an agreement that allows the 
Newbury Park Pony Baseball League to build a ball field at Cypress Elementary 
School for the youth organization's spring season. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise followed a bitter confrontation at a board meeting in December, 
when baseball league supporters denounced a plan to move some games from 
Sequoia Intermediate School to Newbury Park High School. 
</P>
<P>
 They complained to board members that the high school fields were not 
available for league use until late at night because they are used by high 
school athletic teams after school. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new plan, approved Thursday by the board of the Conejo Valley 
Unified School District, the league will spend up to $30,000 to build a new 
field at Cypress. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is every penny we've saved for years," said Dennis McGurk, vice 
president of the baseball league. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, about $10,000 of joint city and school district redevelopment funds will 
be spent to improve a field at Manzanita Elementary School for use by the 
league. Some of the activities in the 500-player league were moved from Sequoia 
because of neighbors' complaints about noise and parking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some positives do come out of negatives," school board President Dolores 
Didio said. BRENDA DAY

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: PROSECUTOR BACKS OPEN-MEETINGS LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PATRICK McCARTNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County prosecutor has predicted that revisions to California's 
open-meeting law, scheduled to go into effect April 1, will make it more 
difficult for local governments to conduct public business in private. 
</P>
<P>
 "The new Brown Act will help strengthen the resolve of public officials to 
keep the public's business public," Assistant Dist. Atty. Colleen Toy White 
said Thursday at a Camarillo seminar on the pending revisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Sponsored by the Ventura County Press Club and the law firm of Nordman, 
Cormany, Hair & Compton, the panel discussion featured views of the law by a 
newspaper editor, a city attorney and local prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Coleman, a Ventura County special assistant district attorney, said the 
law will for the first time give prosecutors the power to file civil lawsuits 
against accused violators. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the current Ralph M. Brown Act, which was passed in 1953, no local 
government has ever been successfully prosecuted. Because civil lawsuits do not 
require the same standards of proof, Coleman said the change will add teeth to 
the open-meeting law. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will finally be an incentive for government to do the right thing," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard City Atty. Gary Gillig, who has clashed in the past with Dist. Atty. 
Michael Bradbury over interpretations of the existing law, criticized the 
revised act for requiring ad hoc committees to meet openly. 
</P>
<P>
 Public access to such meetings will "inflame the public and give news to the 
newspapers, but will interfere with effective governing," Gillig said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forget your confidential stamps, folks," Gillig said he would tell Oxnard 
officials. "You work in a fishbowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Julia Wilson, editor of the Ventura County Edition of the Los Angeles Times, 
said the new provision, while tightening up the Brown Act, can still be abused. 
</P>
<P>
 "Open government depends on the goodwill of public officials," Wilson said. "I 
suspect some lawyers and politicians will still find ways to keep information 
hidden." PATRICK McCARTNEY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; TRIAL ORDERED IN MOLESTATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 22-year-old Moorpark man was ordered Friday to stand trial on charges that 
he molested a 12-year-old girl after kidnaping her as she walked home from 
Chaparral Middle School in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Todd W. Howeth, who represents defendant Roberto 
Magdaleno, said his client will be arraigned Jan. 28 in Ventura County Superior 
Court.Magdaleno, who is charged with five counts of child molestation, has 
pleaded innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Howeth said the girl accused Magdaleno of taking her to an unoccupied home and 
attacking her on Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant was arrested several hours after the girl reported the incident. 
An earlier preliminary hearing was postponed after prosecutors refused to put 
the girl on the witness stand to testify against Magdaleno. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, victim testimony is not required at preliminary hearings, 
Howeth said. Victims are required to testify only at trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors eventually agreed to let the public defender question the girl out 
of court, but the victim still refused to talk to him, Howeth said. Friday's 
hearing was held without her testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 "The law is designed to protect victims of crime," Howeth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Rebecca Day, who is prosecuting the case, could not be 
reached Friday. DWAYNE BRAY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; CONCERNS ARISE OVER MOBILE CAR 
WASHERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two months after approving new regulations on mobile car washers, the Thousand 
Oaks City Council will review the issue again, focusing on concerns that runoff 
from dirty vehicles may be polluting storm drains. 
</P>
<P>
 Most council members thought they had settled the matter in November, when 
they decided to charge mobile car washers an annual $150 licensing fee and keep 
them out of the busiest shopping-mall parking lots.The mobile washers also 
agreed to stay at least 75 feet from the nearest storm drain. 
</P>
<P>
 City staff spent two months drafting a law to meet the council's 
specifications and scheduled a vote for Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The item was placed on the early portion of the agenda, which is reserved for 
non-controversial topics. Yet environmentalists and owners of drive-through 
carwashes have served notice that they will raise a fuss. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Galley, president of the Conejo Valley Car Wash Assn., wrote a letter to 
the council indicating that he will bring new evidence that his mobile 
competitors let contaminants run into storm drains. Cassandra Auerbach, the 
local leader of the Sierra Club, also wrote a letter condemning the mobile car 
washers for "dumping industrial waste into storm drains." 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider all the evidence at 5:15 p.m. Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also will decide whether to charge mobile car washers a fee of up 
to $1,032 a year to cover the city's costs for catching and treating the 
polluted runoff.  
</P>
<P>
 "The issue has always been whether or not mobile car washers pollute," 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar said. "At first, we thought they did. Then we got a 
report back (from the Regional Water Quality Control Board) saying they didn't. 
Now this. It will be interesting to listen." STEPHANIE SIMON

CITY PLAN TO STOP PAYING CROSSING GUARDS ANGERS SCHOOL OFFICIALS; BUDGET: 
VENTURA, CITING A RECENT STATE LEGISLATIVE DECISION, IS THREATENING TO PASS ON 
THE $77,000 COST TO THE DISTRICT. EDUCATORS ARGUE MORAL RESPONSIBILITY IS AT 
STAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raising the ire of some school officials, the city of Ventura is threatening 
to stop paying the wages of the 20 crossing guards who help children navigate 
busy streets on their way to school. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking advantage of state lawmakers' decision last year that cities and 
counties are no longer required to pay for crossing guards in their areas, 
Ventura city officials have proposed that the local school district take over 
the $77,000 program cost. 
</P>
<P>
 But the president of the Ventura Unified School District board said the city 
and the Police Department, which runs the crossing guard program for Ventura, 
still have a moral responsibility to provide crossing guards even if they are 
no longer legally required to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are an educational institution," board President Diane Harriman said at 
this week's meeting. "The Police Department and the city of Ventura are just as 
responsible for the safety of the kids on the street as we are." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura is not the first agency in the county to try to get out of paying for 
crossing guards. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Board of Supervisors last summer stopped funding the 
program in all unincorporated areas of the county, leaving individual school 
districts to scramble to provide the service themselves in those locations. 
</P>
<P>
 At about the same time, the city of Santa Paula asked the Santa Paula 
Elementary School District to take over the $60,000 cost of paying for crossing 
guards in that city. 
</P>
<P>
 But the school district refused, and now Santa Paula has no crossing guards, 
City Manager Arnold Dowdy said. "There's a lot of parents walking their kids to 
school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Oxnard, city officials proposed last fall that the Oxnard Elementary School 
District begin paying the $336,000 cost of their city's crossing guard program. 
The city backed down after angry parents packed City Council meetings to 
protest, but school officials have said they expect the matter to come up 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid a public uproar in Ventura, school officials have been meeting 
quietly with the chief of the Ventura Police Department, which runs the city's 
crossing guard program. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we don't want to do is get into a spitting match with the city," Supt. 
Joseph Spirito told the school board Tuesday night. He said the district is 
trying to negotiate a resolution with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Supt. Joseph Richards said he is very concerned about the potential 
liabilities that the district may face if it were responsible for the crossing 
guard program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And Harriman said she is strongly opposed to the district taking on such 
liabilities. "I think that public safety is a Police Department 
responsibility," she said. "I think that traffic control is a city 
responsibility. And our responsibility is to protect children once they get to 
school and to educate them." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura police and city officials said it is only fair that the school 
district begin paying for crossing guards. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the state Legislature left the public education budget virtually 
untouched last year, it drastically cut funding to cities and counties, Ventura 
City Councilman Gregory L. Carson said Wednesday. To help make up for these 
cuts, the state gave cities and counties permission to stop funding certain 
programs, including crossing guards. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're having to cut services right and left because of our budget situation," 
Carson said. "They were kept whole. As far as I'm concerned, they should take 
an added responsibility for staying whole." 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Ventura has cut $7.5 million from its budget over the past 2 1/2 
years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Lt. Steve Bowman said the city has proposed to gradually 
transfer responsibility for the program to the district. The Police Department 
would, for example, continue training the crossing guards after the district 
began paying their salaries and coordinating the program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to dump it on them," Bowman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman agreed with school officials that the city shares some responsibility 
for providing crossing guards, particularly because the safety workers help 
many residents other than children cross at busy intersections during school 
hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The city employs about 20 part-time crossing guards who take turns filling 16 
posts around the city during the morning, lunch period and immediately after 
school. They are each paid roughly $5 per hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Bowman said the district may be better able to monitor the program because 
school officials know best when and where crossing guards are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crossing guards cross more than students, and it obviously affects the 
whole community," he said. "But in these days of budget cuts, we need to find 
the most economical way to keep people safe. The old way may not be the best 
way."

ELECTIONS BALLOT MEASURE; OAK PARK ISSUE CAUGHT UP IN POLITICS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oak Park residents may get a chance to vote on the future of their 
unincorporated enclave this spring if the Ventura County Board of Supervisors 
approves a proposal to place an advisory measure on the June ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Maria VanderKolk has asked the board to authorize $8,500 for a 
ballot measure offering Oak Park voters three options: incorporate as an 
independent city, become part of Thousand Oaks, or continue as an 
unincorporated community. 
</P>
<P>
 But her recommendation -- to be voted on at Tuesday's board meeting -- has 
become entangled in election-year politics. 
</P>
<P>
 With VanderKolk set to retire when her term ends in January, 1995, two 
candidates for her seat have seized on the ballot proposal as an issue sure to 
attract the attention of Oak Park voters. 
</P>
<P>
 In announcing his candidacy for VanderKolk's seat representing the Conejo 
Valley, Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo this week said an advisory 
election would be a waste of money. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern for Oak Park is that residents there resent the fact that they 
have to spend their money . . . to put it on the ballot," Schillo said. "I 
think the same thing could be accomplished cheaper in a town hall forum." 
</P>
<P>
 Money for an Oak Park ballot measure would come from the county's community 
service account earmarked for public works projects in the tiny enclave. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, money from that fund is used to pay for Oak Park's street sweeping 
and maintenance, street median landscaping and bike path renovations. The 
account, which contains roughly $300,000, also funds salaries for school 
crossing guards, said Steve Williams of the county's Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Money that would be spent on the election could buy a lot of books for the 
library, keep the library open a lot longer or pay for a new crossing guard," 
said Ron Stark, a member of the Oak Park Municipal Advisory Council. Stark has 
been considering running for supervisor, but said this week that he may instead 
throw his support to Schillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Another Municipal Advisory Council member, however, said Schillo's town 
meeting idea seemed impractical. While the forum would certainly draw a large 
turnout, George Anterasian said, any informal discussion would lack the 
authoritative weight of an official ballot tally. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a pretty important decision to leave up to a show of hands," agreed H. 
Jere Robings, who has announced plans to run against Schillo in the 
supervisor's race. "You don't know who would be in the audience, who would be 
raising their hands, or who would be counting." 
</P>
<P>
 Normally a tight-fisted guardian of taxpayer dollars, Robings said he 
considered a ballot measure a worthwhile expense. 
</P>
<P>
 VanderKolk, too, insisted that only an official vote would provide an 
unequivocal picture of what Oak Park's 2,500 residents want for their future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care what anyone else says, this is my term and these are my 
decisions and it's going to go on the ballot," VanderKolk said. "I can 
guarantee you that a town meeting . . . would not give you any idea what the 
majority thinks."

FUNERAL ASSISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The "Dear Abby" column recently included a letter concerning a person who had 
been sold a $1,200 casket which the mortician told her was burned with the body 
of the deceased. She was concerned that she might have been cheated. 
</P>
<P>
 Abby consulted John Blake, executive director of the nonprofit consumer 
education organization, the Continental Assn. of Funeral and Memorial 
Societies. He stated that no casket is required in cases of cremation, that 
usually only a sturdy cardboard container that any mortuary could sell 
profitably for $30 would be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 I know the morticians of Ventura County intimately; as president of Channel 
Islands Memorial Society, I call on them annually to inspect their premises and 
compile a comparative list of the prices they charge. Not one of those honest 
merchants would try to sell a casket where cremation is involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Having said that, I must hasten to add that every mortician is a business 
person. As such, he or she wants to sell as much of the available goods and 
services as is reasonably possible. And any merchant would prefer selling a 
casket costing $2,000 to one costing $800, or an expensive vault to a cheap 
grave liner. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to note that Abby referred her readers to the Continental Assn. 
for information on dignified, low-cost funerals. The Channel Islands Memorial 
Society, one of 175 Continental Assn. members in the U.S. and Canada, can offer

RADAR WEATHER SYSTEM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a Ventura County resident, I am interested in the placement of a radar 
weather tracking station on Sulpher Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Do we really need such as system? The U.S. government has spent billions of 
our dollars creating a weather satellite tracking system for the United 
States.Why, now, the change to a microwave system that creates hazardous 
radiation over a broad area? Why establish 115 such weather stations throughout 
the United States? Is there something here that our government is not telling 
us? I would like to know the strength, intensity, and distance that the station 
will send the microwaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Any variation in the intensity and strength in the microwaves will affect the 
human immune system and lead to a host of diseases. Studies have been conducted 
in Switzerland on the effects of microwave radiation. The results indicate a 
change in the blood leading to conditions that cause cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it be that these radar weather tracking stations are designed for 
something else?

TRASH TRUCK ACCIDENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re: Dec. 29 article about trash truck driver injury in Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 On behalf of my family, our drivers and other employees, I wish to thank the 
people who came to the aid of our driver, Adrian Ochoa.He was seriously injured 
on Dec. 28 when a hydraulic arm on the trash truck he was operating crushed him 
against the vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the fast action of Doris Hackett, the first neighbor who called 911, 
and the quick response of the Ventura Fire Department and Pruner Ambulance 
Service, this accident could have been fatal to our driver. 
</P>
<P>
 The nurses and doctors at Ventura County Medical Center are also to be 
commended. We as a community can be very proud of how accidents are responded 
to, and again, our heartfelt thank you to all who helped save Mr. Ochoa's life.

DEATH PENALTY DECISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We must protest the serious mischaracterization of our remarks after the 
arraignment in the Mark Thornton case. We did not "charge" Dist. Atty.Michael 
Bradbury with basing his decision to seek the death penalty on political 
motives. 
</P>
<P>
 In our view, neither Mr. Thornton's background, nor the crime that he is 
charged with, as tragic as it obviously is, justifies the death penalty in this 
case. We described the types of cases which in Ventura County have resulted in 
a verdict of death: multiple murders, men who have been previously convicted of 
murder, murders that occurred during the course of a sexual assault, and 
murders of children. The crime that Mr. Thornton is accused of, while extremely 
grave, does not fit into any of the categories for which Ventura County jurors 
have imposed the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 We were asked by one of the reporters whether we felt that the fact that Mr. 
Bradbury has announced his decision to seek reelection on the day before the 
decision in the Thornton case had any bearing on his decision to seek the death 
penalty for Mr. Thornton. While acknowledging that the timing was "curious and 
perhaps more than a coincidence," we certainly never accused, nor did we intend 
to accuse Mr. Bradbury of being politically motivated in this decision. 
</P>
<P>
 We wish to emphasize that we feel that Mr. Bradbury's judgment in seeking the 
death penalty is not supported by other death penalty cases in this county. We 
also wish to emphasize that we have not accused him of having been politically 
motivated in making that decision.

SCHOOL BEFORE FASHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to "Clothing Clash," Jan. 6: I can only throw my hands in the air. 
 
</P>
<P>
 My children attend a private school where uniforms are worn.What many parents 
fail to recognize is that a dress code encourages children to develop their 
individual personalities based on who they are, not how they dress. Personally, 
I would prefer that my children's popularity be due to their caring, 
intelligent, witty personalities (as is the case), not because I can afford to 
keep them in what their peers feel is fashionably correct clothing.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents who feel they must neither inhibit nor restrict their children's 
freedom of expression by imposing limits on their behavior are doing their 
children a severe disservice. Children need limits and parents who are not 
afraid to set them.  
</P>
<P>
 If my children told me they didn't want to wear the uniforms, my response 
would not be "OK, sweetie. I understand and respect your right to express 
yourself by wearing nose and naval rings, and underwear as outerwear." My 
response would be "tough," period.  
</P>
<P>
 After school, they may choose their clothing (and even then, there are 
limits). During school, however, I insist their focus be on learning, not on 
making fashion statements. Today's fashion statements will not help them in 
tomorrow's job market.

 The annual service is sponsored jointly by the archdiocese and the Southern 
California Ecumenical Council. It is part of a nationally observed Week of 
Prayer for Christian Unity. 
</P>
<P>
 More information is available from the archdiocese's Office of Interreligious 
and Ecumenical Affairs at (213) 617-3433.

MUSIC REVIEW; RATTLE FINDS PATHOS AND PASSION IN MAHLER 9TH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, TIMES MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gustav Mahler was dying when he wrote his Ninth Symphony in 1909, and he knew 
it. The massive, convoluted valedictory depicts a halting journey toward 
renunciation, toward self-realization and, perhaps, transfiguration. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a painful journey, and there are many pitfalls -- emotional as well as 
technical -- along the way. In 85 minutes, Mahler tests the impact of heroic 
pathos while exploring all manner of introspective digression. The symphony is 
folksy one moment, grotesque the next, thunderously dramatic yet exquisitely 
lyrical. It represents one of the last great gasps of a romanticism in decline 
if not decay. 
</P>
<P>
 In the adagio, Mahler wove his fragmented melodic strands into a texture of 
ever-increasing transparency. It is significant, no doubt, that he marked the 
long-avoided final cadence pianissississimo . Just in case anyone missed the 
expressive point, he added a fateful dynamic instruction: "ersterbend." 
</P>
<P>
 The composer literally wanted all sound to die away. Slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruno Walter observed that the passage resembled "the melting of a cloud into 
the ethereal blue." He conducted the premiere in Vienna in 1912, 13 months 
after Mahler's death. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Philharmonic has served the Mahler Ninth in various honorable 
ways. The orchestra has played it urgently for Sir John Barbirolli, elegantly 
for Pierre Boulez, with passionate breadth for Kurt Sanderling and with mellow 
resignation for Carlo Maria Giulini. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, it was Simon Rattle's turn. 
</P>
<P>
 The 39-year-old Briton -- far too infrequent a guest on the Music Center 
podium -- did many wonderful things. But nothing was as wonderful as the 
poignant resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Rattle defied anyone to breathe as he allowed the melody to unwind at last. 
The concerted tone gradually evaporating, he filed the instrumental voice to a 
whisper. Then he made it softer. No one could be quite sure when the symphony 
actually had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience responded with the most telling of tributes: stunned silence. No 
one dared move, much less applaud. It took a long time for the noisy ovation to 
arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Rattle certainly deserved his noisy ovation. He projected Mahler's sprawling 
agonies and delirious ecstasies with pervasive clarity and with enough 
restraint to avoid any traps of vulgarity. He sustained tension not just from 
climax to climax but from movement to movement, perfectly defining the long 
architectural arch in the process. He savored supple detail and subtle charm, 
yet always respected the pervasive need for momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its intimate appeal, this remained music-making on a gigantic scale. 
It was music-making that could accommodate brutal force and noble grandeur 
without slighting finesse and intimacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rattle made the rustic Landler of the second movement a compelling 
contradiction to the sublime melancholy of the opening andante. Consequently, 
he made the bitter defiance of the third-movement rondo a perfect prelude to 
the sensitive reconciliation of the finale. 
</P>
<P>
 The Philharmonic players responded sympathetically at worst, brilliantly at 
best. They always rise to the loftiest challenges.

WOMEN AT TOP IN MUSIC; PREMIERE: LONG BEACH SYMPHONY MUSIC DIRECTOR JOANN 
FALLETTA WILL CONDUCT COMPOSER ELLEN TAAFFE ZWILICH'S NEW WORK TONIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DIANE HAITHMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Women working with women may be common in many fields, but it's still pretty 
rare in the world of music, at least at the top. But, slowly, even that is 
changing.  
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach Symphony music director JoAnn Falletta, 39, who became the first 
American-born woman ever appointed to lead a regional orchestra when she was 
appointed director in 1989, and Pulitzer Prize-winning composer Ellen Taaffe 
Zwilich will be together tonight at the Terrace Theater when Falletta conducts 
the Long Beach Symphony in the premiere performance of Zwilich's newest work, 
"Fantasy for Orchestra," which Falletta also commissioned. 
</P>
<P>
 In a telephone interview earlier this week, Falletta said she would like this 
to be a non-issue but acknowledges that it still is. She maintains a tradition 
of fostering women composers, but she wanted to work with Zwilich for her 
talent, not just because of gender issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ellen, for us is a tremendous coup; she has been commissioned by all the 
major symphonies," Falletta said. "When I asked her a couple of years ago (to 
compose a work for Long Beach) and she said yes, I was just thrilled, because I 
know this piece will go on from Long Beach to be played all over the world." 
Certainly Zwilich has a track record for such accomplishment: Her work has been 
performed by major orchestras worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Falletta, who recently signed a three-year contract to continue as the Long 
Beach Symphony director (she divides her time between three orchestras: Long 
Beach, the Virginia Symphony and San Francisco's Women's Philharmonic), said 
she often directs the Women's Philharmonic in works by contemporary women, 
including Zwilich, as well as women composers of the past whose works are 
rarely heard, including Clara Schumann, Fanny Mendelssohn and Alma Mahler. On 
Jan. 29, the Women's Philharmonic will feature North American composers in a 
"salute to uncommon women." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, while both women feel the need to nurture women in composing and 
conducting, both insist that there is no such thing as "women's" music. 
</P>
<P>
 "Really, having looked at hundreds and hundreds of scores, I can't discern any 
difference," Falletta said. "There is nothing that is gender based. . . . I 
know there are people who sit out there and think that if it's a woman 
composer, it will be very gentle and full of harp credenzas, but (Zwilich's 
music) is very strong and very powerful. All of a sudden their preconceptions 
of what women do are changed." 
</P>
<P>
 Zwilich said she believes that it is more difficult for women to break into 
conducting than composing or performing orchestra music. "The behind-the-screen 
audition process has been very beneficial for women who play orchestral 
instruments, and with a piece of music, the musician has little relation with 
the composer," she said. "But the podium issue directly raises the issue of 
power and is the last frontier, I think, of music. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the extraordinary range of what's going on in contemporary music, each 
composer is quite individual," Zwilich continued. "I suppose it would be 
possible, in time, to go back and assess it, but I think people write the music 
that is in their minds and in their hearts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also remember a time when people actually talked about whether Mozart's 
music was 'masculine' or 'feminine.' It seemed kind of silly, to invent a 
category and find things that fit." 
</P>
<P>
 Both women believe that there are as many preconceptions about orchestral 
music as a whole as there are about women in that arena. "Someone once asked me 
if I was a living composer," Zwilich said in a recent telephone conversation 
from her Florida home. "I said yes -- after I stopped laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 Zwilich, who based her four-part composition on her experiences during a visit 
to Italy last summer ("It began with a kind of free collaboration on church 
bells I was hearing"), said she hopes the audience will be energized, rather 
than turned off, by being the first to hear a piece by a "living composer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very unsettling for some audiences not to know what they are getting 
into, but, when you think about it, it's an extraordinarily exciting moment," 
she said. "My experience has been that audiences are really digging in and 
feeling something special the moment something comes alive, particularly 
something by someone whose life experience is at least contemporaneous with 
theirs." 
</P>
<P>
 Falletta said the symphony commissions new works to help change the perception 
that orchestral music is the province of dead European males. "I really feel 
very strongly that an orchestra is not a museum," said Falletta. "We do one or 
two (new) works a year by young American composers; that has become part of our 
identity." This year's commissions are Zwilich's "Fantasy" and the "Fractal 
Bow" by California composer Martin Herman, to be presented April 23. 
</P>
<P>
 "And, while some people are saying they'd just as soon hear Beethoven all the 
time, others say the new works show that we have a vision, and a mission, and 
are making a difference in the orchestral life of this country," Falletta 
continued. "(The audience) may be complaining about a new piece, but they are 
talking about it, and writing letters to us about it. We have become a model 
for other orchestras in the country because we have taken risks."

POP BEAT / Q&A WITH QUEEN LATIFAH: REIGNING IN MANY COURTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HEIDI SIEGMUND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Queen Latifah is catching the last bit of winter sunlight on the Burbank set 
of Fox's Sunday night show "Living Single." Wearing a sweat shirt and no trace 
of makeup, she looks much like a streetwise young woman from a tough New Jersey 
neighborhood (which she is), and not the successful publishing executive she 
portrays on the sitcom.  
</P>
<P>
 But playing a thriving businesswoman isn't exactly a reach for Latifah , whose 
real name is Dana Owens. To be sure, the 23-year-old rap artist wears many 
hats, both literally -- she's one of designer Todd Oldham's favorite clients -- 
and figuratively. Besides her TV career, she played a nurse in the Michael 
Keaton movie "My Life," and is also CEO of the Flavor Unit management firm 
whose artists include Naughty by Nature. And Latifah -- whose adopted Arabic 
name means delicate and kind -- recently released her third and most 
introspective rap album, "Black Reign." Along with her usual tough-minded raps, 
including the hit single "U.N.I.T.Y.," much of the album pays tender tribute to 
her older brother , Lance Owens, a police officer who was killed in an off-duty 
motorcycle accident in 1992.  
</P>
<P>
 In this interview, she spoke about the new album, the death of her brother and 
the state of rap today.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: With rap's requisite brava do, did it feel risky to put out such a 
personal album? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: This album was actually kind of a release. My brother's death played a 
big part because he died only a couple of months before I did the album. I 
intentionally chose to (record it) at that time . . . and it helped me just to 
deal with his death. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Your father is also a former police officer. Having family members on the 
force, how do you view rap songs that attack police officers? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I see both sides. I've seen abuse, and I've been the victim of police who 
abuse their authority. When people use their badge in a way that it shouldn't 
be used and treat people like everybody is some kind of criminal and look at 
every young black man like he's a killer, I have a problem. And it's not just 
white cops who behave like that; all kind of cops have this attitude.  
</P>
<P>
 On the other side, you've got cops getting shot all the time. You got people 
who don't respect them at all. A cop can't be nice to everybody. They're 
fighting criminals. They've got some serious bad guys, who have the attitude of 
kill or be killed. 
</P>
<P>
 But I would like to see police forces stepping to the officers who they know 
are abusive and personally changing their attitudes. When rappers say, "Kill 
the cops," (officers have) to deal with it, because they haven't done anything 
to make sure that their fellow officers are changing their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: In "U.N.I.T.Y.," you take men to task for casually referring to women as 
"bitches" and "ho's." Why do you think this theme has struck such a chord? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I guess people are just ready to have an anti-"bitch" record. People are 
sick of it. It's not even just women, it's women and men. Some guys are sick of 
being prejudged by women who think they're going to disrespect them or are only 
out for one thing. There are men with values out there. . . . I'm not 
nit-picking. If you're playing around, it's cool. But if someone's trying to 
hurt me by saying "bitch," I'm not gonna stand for that.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of these brothers out here just don't know how to act. I know a lot of 
young brothers out here who put their hands on their women (and beat them up). 
Young boys. They're boys! They need to figure out a better way to express 
themselves, and that's just the bottom line.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: In the same song, you have a line, "There's plenty of people with triggers 
ready to pull it, why you trying to jump in front of the bullet?" Usually 
that's a sentiment reserved for men, but you dedicate it to the "ladies." 
</P>
<P>
 A: I know a lot of young girls who saw a "Gangsta Bitch" video by Apache and 
then flipped and became gangsta bitches and thought they were hard-core. I ran 
the streets from 15 years old on . . . and that taught me a lot. You're not 
hard-core 'cause you want to be. It's necessity. You had to be (hard) because 
of where you were from. It's not something you (should) aspire to be. Aspire to 
be a doctor or a lawyer but not a (gangster). 
</P>
<P>
 I want them to understand that they're going to get through all this mess and 
grow up and graduate from high school. You go to college or go to work. And the 
damage that you've done in high school, when you go around and cut somebody's 
face, they're gonna wear that for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What differences do you see between living in Los Angeles and New Jersey? 
</P>
<P>
 A: This is a slave state as far as I'm concerned. There's a lot of classism, 
racism -- more so then where I'm from because we all live around each other so 
we have to tolerate one another to a point. Everybody gets to be so spread out 
here so they don't have to deal with people. The dividing lines are just too 
thick for me.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Where do you see your career heading five years from now? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'll probably still be doing "Living Single," and I hope to be married with 
children. I want a big family so they can be the toughest family on the block. 
They can jump everybody else's kids (she giggles). You know the family around 
the corner that had 11 kids and you couldn't (mess) with them, even if they 
were wrong? That's gonna be my family. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you feel more pressure to prove your street credibility to your fans now 
that you're on a weekly sitcom? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't have to prove anything to anybody. I prove it through my actions. 
I'm down for mine, and people know that.

KFI RENEGES ON ORAL PROMISE TO PAY BONUS, GATES CLAIMS; RADIO: FORMER L.A. 
POLICE CHIEF PLANS TO TAKE HIS COMPLAINT TO UNION ARBITRATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl Gates, who left his last full-time job 
amid controversy and acrimony, now is angry at his latest former employer, 
radio station KFI-AM (640). 
</P>
<P>
 Gates, whose 15-month stint as a talk-show host ended on New Year's Eve, says 
KFI has reneged on an oral promise by program director David Hall to pay him a 
bonus if he could improve the ratings in his 7-9 p.m. slot. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arbitron quarterly ratings survey released last week showed that Gates' 
ratings did climb by more than one share point among the 35- to 54-year-old 
audience, which was the target group that the agreement focused on, Gates said. 
Gates attracted 5.3% of these listeners during the three months of fall, 
compared to 4.2% during the summer months. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the agreement between him and Hall, the bonus for such an 
increase would be "in the five figures," Gates said. But he said that when he 
pressed Hall for the money last week, the program director claimed Gates had 
misunderstood and that there was no such contractual agreement. And when he 
took his case to General Manager Howard Neal, he said, the station came back 
with "a very modest offer, so modest that it was almost insulting." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall and Neal declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said he has contacted his attorney and intends to take the matter to 
arbitration by the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists, the 
union that represents talk-show hosts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Imagine me, contacting a union?" Gates said. "We had a warm, friendly 
relationship. I didn't want to get lawyers involved, but there's a principle 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gates said it was the promise of a bonus that convinced him to sign a new 
three-month contract with KFI last fall. "Quite frankly, I would have left in 
September if I had known there wasn't going to be a bonus," he said. "I don't 
care that much about the money. But I do think people have to be held 
accountable for what they say and do. I have been over the years." 
</P>
<P>
 The former police chief said he now believes that KFI's decision not to renew 
his contract at the end of the year was financially motivated. "I think they 
said at that point, 'Oh-oh. He's going to cost us too much money,' " Gates 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time they parted company, Hall had said that money was not a factor and 
that Gates was being released because his stay at KFI had always been intended 
as temporary. Gates did not fight to stay, explaining that he had other 
activities to pursue.

 The Icewoman Cometh?: Interest in a television movie about the alleged 
conspiracy in the recent attack on national figure skating champion Nancy 
Kerrigan is heating up. Both NBC and CBS said they are mulling over several 
pitches from producers who want to do a film on Kerrigan, Olympic rival Tonya 
Harding and suspects who have been arrested in the incident. Spokespersons for 
both networks said Friday they have not made a firm decision as of yet to 
become involved with a Kerrigan-related film. However, executives at ABC said 
they "have no interest whatsoever" in doing a Kerrigan movie, according to a

CLUB 369 IN FULLERTON TO OFFER ALTERNATIVE MUSIC; VENUES: THE FACILITY, WHICH 
IS CHANGING TO 21-AND-OVER, IS A GLIMMER OF HOPE TO ROCK FANS AFTER BOGART'S 
CLOSURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The newest hope on a local rock scene diminished by the recent closing of 
Bogart's is Club 369, which will occupy a room in Fullerton best known as the 
former site of the heavy-metal venue Goodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Club owner Greg Howell aims to feature a steady diet of local and touring 
alternative-rock bands at the club, which draws its name from the number of 
people it can hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Howell has owned the club, at 1641 Placentia Ave., since February. He 
previously ran it as an all-ages venue called NYC (for New Youth Club). Now he 
is changing to a 21-and-over format, with full bar. Howell, of Newport Beach, 
said Wednesday that Club 369 will open as soon as he has a liquor license in 
hand. He said that the license has been approved and that he simply is waiting 
for the actual document to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Clark, supervising inspector in the Santa Ana office of the California 
Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control, confirmed that the local office has 
recommended approval of Howell's license but said the application awaits final 
action by ABC authorities in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Howell, 39, said he has owned bars in Orange County for 10 years, having 
previously operated Popeye's and the Island Yacht Club in Costa Mesa. He 
acknowledged that his experience with booking and promoting alternative rock is 
limited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm pretty green in that area," he said. "I plan to learn as much as I can 
about it. I see working with outside promoters in the beginning and feeling it 
out."  
</P>
<P>
 At least for now, Howell said, he does not envision hiring a full-time, 
in-house booker, which was one of the keys to Bogart's excellence. That club, 
in Long Beach, closed last month after a run of more than six years as the hub 
of the local grass-roots rock scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Howell said he intends to continue working with John Pantle, a local 
alternative-rock promoter who ran the twice-a-week 8 1/2 Club alternative 
series for him at NYC, as well as with other independent promoters. No firm 
bookings have been announced for Club 369. 
</P>
<P>
 "The plan will be to pursue alternative type music," Howell said. "We may 
start out doing three or four nights a week live, and see how it goes from 
there. I would love it to work into seven nights a week." 
</P>
<P>
 Howell closed NYC after a New Year's Eve show, to "get the bar all tuned up" 
for its new incarnation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 8 1/2 Club's tenure, Howell said, "we (were) very successful with No 
Doubt, Pennywise, Firehose, D.I., those types of bands." But 8 1/2 had trouble 
sustaining a steady draw among the all-ages audience, especially when school 
was in session. 
</P>
<P>
 "We put on six months of shows, brought a lot of bands in that never played 
Orange County before. The club did well for what it was, but we were losing 
money," said promoter Pantle. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger fans are the biggest losers in the switch from all-ages to a 
21-and-over format. But Howell decided that too many of those younger fans were 
too much trouble -- whether they were rock fans attending 8 1/2 Club shows, or 
the hip-hop, rap and dance-music crowd that turned out on other nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "The younger kids, it was tough to handle them," he said. "They'd break stuff. 
Man, they were terrors. It seemed like they came out to destroy things. They'd 
kick holes in the walls, generally abuse the toilet facilities, write all over 
stuff, and they tended to hang around in the parking lot and drink. You 
certainly have problems in every bar business, but (with a drinking-age 
audience) I don't think we'll have the types of situations and frequency of the 
problems we had with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Howell said Club 369 will not have a pay-to-play policy: "I don't believe in 
that." However, he said untested bands who open shows will be expected to play 
for free until they have established that they can draw an audience. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they're starting out, they want to play with the big names. They do play 
for nothing, usually, just to get exposure and a place for their friends to 
come see them other than a garage," Howell said. If these novices show 
potential, "we book them higher up and on better nights, and they start getting 
a cut of the door." 
</P>
<P>
 Howell that he is forming an alliance with Club Mesa, an alternative-rock 
venue owned by his friend Dick Smith. Howell said the two clubs aim to start a 
mini-circuit, offering local bands shows at each venue, most likely on 
successive weekends, and promoting the concerts jointly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The benefit of doing it is we can give the better bands more work," Smith 
said. "Running them on (either) side of the county will work real well." 
</P>
<P>
 Club Mesa, at 843 W. 19th St. in Costa Mesa, recently expanded its capacity 
from 200 to 358 by converting kitchen space into a room with pool tables. 
However, its small performing area has not been enlarged. Nevertheless, the 
club is going ahead with some higher-profile bookings of touring attractions, 
including a show Tuesday by Agent Orange, Boar's Head and Drain Bramage, and a 
bill Friday with DOA, Guttermouth, Ragabash and Zero Hour. (714) 642-8448. 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street from Club Mesa at 720 W. 19th St. is Our House, a very 
promising new venue that recently began booking once- or twice-weekly 
alternative rock concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-capacity room is a combination bar and coffeehouse that has some of 
the coziness of Bogart's side room, the Bohemian Cafe, but without the 
Bohemian's dark, chilly cast. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent concert by Claw Hammer and a band from San Diego, Uncle Joe's Big Ol' 
Driver, drew a capacity crowd. There was no concert lighting, but the portable 
stage and hired sound system were more than adequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Best of all, the audience heeded promoter Chris Fahey's suggestion that it 
forgo slam dancing, that annoying, so-trite ritual of the alternative-rock set, 
in favor of doing the pogo, the original form of punk dancing. With slamming, 
the small space would be unbearable (and some nice glass fixtures etched with 
figures of nude Asian dancers, left over from a past incarnation as a Chinese 
restaurant, would be in extreme jeopardy). Without it, the place works 
beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 Among its amenities is a very large selection of reasonably priced beers. The 
Muffs, Flop and the Women play at Our House on Thursday, and Smile, Feeble and 
Just Plain Big perform Friday. (714) 650-8960. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new entry on the local grass-roots scene is Nomads Presents, an 
independent promoter based in Venice. Jennifer Kelton, who runs Nomads, 
operated a club of the same name in West Los Angeles until high rents drove her 
out of business about a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worked a lot at Nomads with Orange County bands," Kelton said. "I realized 
there was a lot of good talent there." She aims to book concerts at various 
clubs in Orange County and Long Beach as well as in Los Angeles. Nomads will 
present the Primitive Painters, Enduring May and National People's Gang at the 
Electric Circus in Buena Park on Friday ((714) 827-1210) and Medicine Rattle, 
Michael Bay and Jimmy Stafford & Charlie Colin at System M in Long Beach on 
Jan. 22 ((310) 435-2525).

MIME-ALTERING; THIS SEATTLE TROUPE USES DANCE AS WELL AS THE SPOKEN WORD IN ITS 
SHOWS 
</P>

 A lonely princess, a forlorn fisherman, a touch of magic and a moral at the 
end -- that's what "The Story of Truong Chi" is made of. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vietnamese folk tale will be brought to life in Fullerton today by Seattle 
Mime Theatre, a 17-year-old touring trio that uses a contemporary blend of 
traditional mime, dance, improvisation, music and the spoken word performed 
with colorful costumes and props. 
</P>
<P>
 "We first devised the work for our children's programming," said Bruce L. 
Wylie, the troupe's co-artistic director and founding member. "But we found 
that adults like the story at least as much, so for several years we've 
included it in our general shows. It's a universal story with archetypal 
characters which might be parallel to 'Beauty and the Beast.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The eight-minute piece will be part of a mixed bill presented at Plummer 
Auditorium by Cal State Fullerton's Professional Artists in Residence Celebrity 
Series. 
</P>
<P>
 It's "an adaptation, an interpretation of the Vietnamese story as we read it 
in English," Wylie said by phone recently from Seattle. "We had done Native 
American stories and several European fairy tales" before creating the work 
"but had not anything from that part of the world." 
</P>
<P>
 The allegory begins as a princess, who lives a solitary life with her father, 
the king, hears beautiful singing emanating from a river below the palace, said 
Wylie, recounting the tale in rich detail, as if telling it to a child at 
bedtime. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, the princess falls ill, and nothing seems to bring her back to 
health," he said. Nothing, that is, until she hears the singing again, which 
magically revives her. Realizing the song comes from a fisherman at the river 
below, the king summons him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fisherman comes to the palace, and the daughter sees that his face is 
grotesquely disfigured, and she sends him away," Wylie said. "But in the same 
moment that she is so repulsed, he falls in love with her. So he goes back to 
his boat, but nothing can console him, and the depth of his sadness causes him 
to die." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Years later, the fisherman's family attempts to move his body to a family 
cemetery, Wylie continued, but in place of his coffin, they find a luminous 
crystal pendant, which they decide to mount on the prow of his boat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then, as these folk-tale coincidences happen, the king sees the crystal and 
takes it to the palace, where one of his artisans transforms it into a goblet. 
Next, amazingly, while filling it with tea one day, he looks inside and sees 
the fisherman's image. 
</P>
<P>
 "He brings the princess to see this, and she too sees the image, and it so 
moves her that she realizes that she made a mistake by dismissing the 
fisherman. She is moved to tears, one tear falls and strikes the goblet, and it 
disappears into the air, liberating the fisherman's spirit." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no coming back for the fisherman, however. The moral of the story, 
Wylie said, has to do with "the tragedy of beauty that is unappreciated in its 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 If all that seems like more than a mouthful, especially for a mime troupe, 
spoken narration helps convey the story, as does the trio's vivid physical 
portrayal, said Wylie.  
</P>
<P>
 "We create still pictures with our bodies, yet each picture slowly dissolves 
into the next," he said. "We might do a palace scene, then we'll all rotate, 
changing positions, and all of a sudden the audience will see an image of a 
boat. It's like fog, gathering into an image, then regathering into another 
image." 
</P>
<P>
 Other works to be presented during the troupe's third Orange County appearance 
are an improvisational number spurred by audience suggestions and a 
rambunctious farce titled "20th Century Vector Movement." 
</P>
<P>
 The trio also does a 22-minute version of "The Secret Life of Walter Mitty," 
in which it creates a dozen different characters and recites the entire text of 
the popular James Thurber short story. 
</P>
<P>
 In a day when many theatrical presentations involve more technical 
pyrotechnics than ever, there's still a demand for the more subtle art of mime, 
said Wylie, who spends up to four months a year on the road, in the United 
States and abroad.

BILL & TED'S ADVENTURES NOT EXCELLENT TO RIVAL NETWORKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANE HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The access that ABC's "Nightline" had to President Clinton during his trip to 
Europe and Russia this week irritated the other TV networks and raised 
questions about the difficulties of extensive access by one TV news 
organization to the chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
 In an unusual arrangement for coverage of a presidential trip abroad, the 
White House agreed to "Nightline's" proposal to cover Clinton and his advisers 
behind the scenes of his meetings with foreign leaders. Over a six-day series 
of broadcasts called "The Making of a Summit," anchor Ted Koppel took viewers 
aboard Air Force One and regularly interviewed the President and other 
officials about the day's events.  
</P>
<P>
 " 'Nightline' struck a deal for coverage with (White House adviser) David 
Gergen, and the other networks have been very unhappy with it," Erik Sorenson, 
executive producer of the "CBS Evening News," said in an interview this week. 
"We were upset that the White House would make this kind of deal with one news 
organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Citing rumors that Gergen might be coming to ABC News as Washington bureau 
chief, Sorenson said, "I think this trip raises the question of whether the 
White House could have a too-cozy relationship with ABC News." 
</P>
<P>
 After correspondents and producers complained about the White House 
arrangements with "Nightline," network executives said, the White House began 
to loosen up the access granted to NBC and CBS for their nightly newscasts. 
Anchors Tom Brokaw and Dan Rather got brief interviews with Clinton on Tuesday 
and Friday, and CNN correspondent Wolf Blitzer also spoke with him Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed that we didn't have more access to the President," a CNN 
spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some ABC staffers expressed concerns that shots of Koppel alongside the 
President while Clinton played a musical instrument in a Prague restaurant made 
Koppel appear to be too much part of the story himself. And some network 
sources also questioned whether Koppel was able to be as tough in his 
questioning of the President throughout the trip as he is when facing an 
interview subject on a regular "Nightline" program. Although Koppel mentioned 
the subject of the Whitewater real estate and banking affair on Monday night, 
it was Clinton's answer Tuesday to a question from Dan Rather about Whitewater 
that made headlines in Wednesday's papers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have great admiration for Ted Koppel, but I think it is very difficult to 
ask a tough question about Whitewater when you know you're going to be with the 
President all week," Sorenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Bettag, executive producer of "Nightline," attributed the other networks' 
criticism to competition. "It's par for this business that if somebody gets 
something you don't, you raise holy hell. The fact of the matter is that 
'Nightline' was in a unique position to do this kind of program -- six hours 
consecutively to look at something this complicated." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettag noted that Koppel pointedly said that Clinton had canceled his 
agreement to be interviewed on Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "Air Force One can be a pretty seductive environment," Bettag said, "but I 
think we did bite the hand that feeds us. Ted mentioned Whitewater on Monday 
night, when the President had just come from his mother's funeral. And he got 
Clinton to admit that he may have been rash in his criticisms of George Bush's 
handling of Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gergen is said to have been a serious candidate for the ABC 
Washington job before he went to the White House, Bettag dismissed rumors of 
his coming to ABC now "as absolute nonsense" and said "the notion that he would 
get the President to talk to 'Nightline' (out of some possible relationship 
with ABC) is ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy White House Press Secretary Ginny Trezano said that officials there saw 
the ABC offer as "a great opportunity for the American people to see their 
President at work. 'Nightline' presented a creative idea, as other networks 
have done with other programs the President has appeared on. We don't think the 
other networks were shut out on this trip."

FOX VOWS TO TREAT NFL WITH 'REVERENCE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If TV critics were wondering how the NFL might feel on the Fox network, the 
new broadcast home of the National Football Conference for the next four years, 
they received a fair idea Friday when Fox kicked off its leg of the semi-annual 
gathering for them in Pasadena with all the energy of a Super Bowl halftime 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics received an "NFL on Fox" gym bag and a jersey with their name embossed 
on the back, both products licensed by the NFL. Then Fox screened a music video 
of hard-hitting football clips intercut with commentary from Fox characters, 
ranging from the Simpsons to the Bundys, all to the tune of the Beatles' 
"Revolution No. 9." 
</P>
<P>
 But despite appearances, network executives vowed that the NFL will retain its 
dignity when broadcasts begin on Fox this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to trivialize it. Homer Simpson will not be in the broadcast 
booth," said David Hill, the Australian head of Sky Sports, the United 
Kingdom's only dedicated sports channel, until media magnate Rupert Murdoch 
brought him over six days ago to preside over the newly formed Fox Sports 
division. 
</P>
<P>
 "We realize we've been given a sacred trust, in sporting terms, and we're 
going to treat it with a reverence it deserves," Hill said. "What you will see 
different is promotions, marketing and the pregame show." 
</P>
<P>
 Lucie Salhany, Fox Broadcasting Co. chairman, echoed Hill's sentiments: "The 
NFL is a tradition. We are not going to deliver a bad telecast. We respect it, 
we paid a lot of money for it, and even though this is a four-year deal, we 
want (football) forever." 
</P>
<P>
 In December, Fox outbid CBS for NFC broadcast rights for a whopping $1.56 
billion. Fox is also talking with the International Olympic Committee about 
acquiring broadcast rights to future Olympics in Fox's effort to become a major 
sports broadcasting presence, part of Salhany's plans to "build and broaden the 
reach of this network," which up until now appealed primarily to young viewers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Fox executives would not elaborate, they indicated they were in 
negotiations with at least some of CBS' longtime football personnel, most 
notably commentator John Madden, to join Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 But in other ways, Fox hopes to improve on NFL broadcasts. The pregame show 
will expand from 30 minutes to one hour and become a "combination of 'NFL 
Today,' '60 Minutes' and 'Entertainment Tonight,' " Hill said.  
</P>
<P>
 Hill also hopes to inject some youth in the broadcasts to "strike a ratio of 
old graybeards . . . and bright young kids . . . not only in front of the 
camera but behind the camera." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox believes it will enhance the value of the NFL by bringing in more youthful 
viewers. According to the network, the NFL has lost 40% of male viewers between 
the ages of 18 and 34 over the past 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 In programming news, Sandy Grushow, Fox Entertainment group president, 
announced that the network has made a three-year production deal for "The 
Simpsons" and has picked up "Living Single" and "The X-Files," Fox's best 
performing new series, for next season. 
</P>
<P>
 He also confirmed that Howard Stern will definitely not be joining the Fox 
network in late night to replace the failed "Chevy Chase Show." Fox has its 
hands full with football and does not expect to relaunch its late-night 
franchise until possibly next year, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, to keep momentum during the summer, when the other networks are 
mostly in repeats, Fox will introduce two new characters to its ensemble series 
"Melrose Place" in May, and then will spin them off into their own summer 
series from producer Aaron Spelling, "Models Inc." One character will be 
Heather Locklear's mother, who runs a successful modeling agency, and the other 
the agency's star model.

DO-IT-YOURSELFERS CAN FRAME THEIR OWN OPINIONS ON STEEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The studs or channels that are used in steel framing are made of metal that is 
rolled into varying thickness, or gauges, at a mill. 
</P>
<P>
 The studs themselves usually are formed so that in cross section they resemble 
a flat-sided C, although some lengths can be Z -shaped. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightweight bracing -- which replaces plywood shear panels in many metal homes 
-- usually comes flat. 
</P>
<P>
 The gauge refers to the thickness of the metal itself, not the overall size of 
the stud. 
</P>
<P>
 The lightest metal in common use is 25 gauge, or 0.0188 of an inch thick. It 
would take a pile of 53 sheets of 25-gauge metal to equal one inch. Looking at 
it another way, one piece is about five times thicker than a sheet of copier 
paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Studs for load-bearing walls and engineered systems are made of either 
20-gauge steel, which is 0.0346 of an inch thick, or 18-gauge, at 0.0451 of an 
inch. 
</P>
<P>
 The heftier materials are 16-gauge, which is 0.0566 of an inch thick; 
14-gauge, at 0.0712 of an inch, and 12-gauge -- the big stud of the bunch -- at 
0.1017 of an inch. 
</P>
<P>
 Pieces thicker than that are classed as structural steel and are usually used 
in residential construction only for very long, unsupported spans -- extra-wide 
garage door openings or cantilevered decks and balconies.

STEELING HOME; METAL IS MAKING INROADS IN O.C. HOUSING: IT'S ENVIRONMENTALLY 
SOUND, RESISTANT TO QUAKES AND FIRE AND IMPERVIOUS TO INSECTS AND ROT. IT'S 
ALSO STRONGER, AND NOW LESS COSTLY THAN WOOD.

<P>
 What makes the house David Busk is building in Ritz Cove at Monarch Bay 
unusual isn't its price or location or even the amenities the custom-home 
builder is adding to his personal residence. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is in the steel framing -- something Busk and others in the 
industry believe is a construction material well within the reach of most 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 Long used in the treeless outback of Australia, in the termite-infested 
Hawaiian Islands, in office construction and in custom homes around the 
country, light-gauge steel framing is turning up with increasing frequency 
across Southern California in moderately priced tract homes. One measure of the 
growing acceptance of steel framing is that the industry now has its own trade 
journal: Metal Home Digest, published by Modern Trade Communications in Skokie, 
Ill. The second issue of the quarterly magazine features articles on steel 
roofing and the new wave of steel framing in Southern California tract 
developments and educational material for builders who want to start using 
metal. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel framing even is available these days for the homeowner with a strong 
do-it-yourself orientation and a desire to try something new. It is being 
stocked alongside more traditional materials by building material suppliers and 
at big warehouse retailers. Supplies were limited at the Home Depot in Santa 
Ana earlier this week, but prices for the equivalent of eight- and 10-foot 
2-by-4s in the lightest gauge available were less than half the posted prices 
for construction-grade wood 2-by-4s. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several arguments for steel framing in houses: It's stronger and 
lighter than wood; termites and other insects won't bother it; it won't rot; it 
has more resistance than wood to the tremendous twisting forces of an 
earthquake or a blasting Santa Ana wind storm; it won't burn (although if 
things get hot enough, it can melt), and it is easy to work with. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, however, there has been one overpowering argument against steel as 
a commonplace building material: It cost more than wood. 
</P>
<P>
 That is changing, though, because of an upsurge in metal recycling and 
diminishing supplies of wood as well as the propensity of timber companies to 
ship the best grades of wood overseas, where they command premium prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Justus, whose Los Angeles-based Silverwood Structures designs and 
packages steel framing, said he supplied 11 tons of metal for the Busk project. 
</P>
<P>
 "At today's prices, the bill is probably 10% to 15% less than if he would have 
used wood for the framing," Justus said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's good news not only for those building a home but also for those 
planning to make changes or additions to a home.  
</P>
<P>
 Want to add a whole room? Or are you just building a few non-structural walls 
as you try to maximize the space in the old homestead? Steel works just as well 
as wood for framing. Maybe better, says architect Scott Martin of Laguna 
Niguel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's easy to use, nice and light, so one person can work with it comfortably, 
and it's not as messy as wood because you don't have all the sawdust," Martin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "And because you screw it together and don't have to drive nails with a hammer 
when you attach pieces to existing studs and joists, installing new steel 
framing is a lot less disruptive to existing plaster, glass and drywall." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who collaborated with Santa Ana architect Jeff Riggs on the Busk home, 
is a big fan of metal framing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I recently added a prefabricated fireplace at my house and used steel studs 
for walling it in," Martin said. "I cut it with a good pair of tin snips and 
put everything together with an electric screwdriver. It is just really clean 
and easy. You even use self-tapping screws, so you don't have to pre-drill 
holes when you put two pieces together. You can use it for just about any 
remodeling project." 
</P>
<P>
 And with steel there is no danger of importing termites as there is when using 
untreated lumber for room additions and other framing projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Metal framing comes in several styles.  
</P>
<P>
 Some builders and framing makers like "stick-for-stick" systems in which the 
steel is used in the same manner as wood -- 2-by-4 studs every 16 inches in the 
walls, with double 2-by-4s over doorways and window openings. The end product 
looks exactly like a wood-framed house except that it gleams in the sun before 
the drywall and exterior covering are added. 
</P>
<P>
 But others say stick-for-stick systems are overbuilt; they use too much 
material and too much labor and cost more than is necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative is an "engineered system," designed by a structural engineer 
to take advantage of the strength and other qualities of steel. Using an 
engineer adds to design costs but can pay for itself by cutting material costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because steel is so much stronger than wood, you can use a lot less of it to 
frame a whole house, or just a room, as long as it is designed by an engineer 
to be safe," Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
 The most common engineered systems are horizontal girt and superstructure 
framing, said Justus. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first, the steel wall studs are four feet apart, and a horizontal metal 
channel, or girt, is installed every two feet up the wall. The girt provides 
bracing and a fastening surface for the interior drywall and the exterior 
siding or stucco. 
</P>
<P>
 A superstructure system uses heavier 2-by-8 framing members every six to eight 
feet, with light gauge studs filling in every two feet. 
</P>
<P>
 The Busk house uses a hybrid -- what Justus calls a "value engineered" system. 
"It is built almost like stick-for-stick, but has the studs on 24-inch centers 
instead of 16 inches, so there's very little wasted material." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding waste is one reason builders and architects are turning to metal. 
With a designed system, all of the components are made to measure at a mill and 
then delivered to the site. Workers then assemble the pieces, using 
self-tapping screws and power screw guns. When cutting is needed -- to angle 
the ends of rafters, for instance -- it is done with a special metal-cutting 
blade on a contractors' chop saw or even on a hand-held power saw. For very 
small jobs using the lighter gauges, tin snips work well. All the shavings and 
ends trimmed are gathered at the end of the day and sent back to the mill for 
recycling into more steel framing.  
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, builders usually order 20% to 30% more wood than they think 
they'll need. The overage -- which adds to the cost of each house -- protects 
against warped and split wood and ensures there will be enough to account for 
odd lengths (they make nine-foot steel studs but they don't make nine-foot 
wooden studs -- the builder buys a 10-foot piece and cuts off a foot). 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of concern about the environment, and that's another good thing 
about steel," Martin said. "It is recyclable. One house like Dave Busk's saves 
250 trees. We are finally getting to the point where we are done wasting wood. 
Most of this steel is made from crushed cars, so it is something that is in 
ample supply." 
</P>
<P>
 Brusk cited all of those reasons for opting for metal framing in his own home 
-- the first metal-framed building he's ever done. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to think I'm on the cutting edge of the building business," he said, 
"and steel is the upcoming technology, so it made sense from that standpoint. 
And I'm tired of fighting constantly rising lumber prices. It's environmentally 
sound; I don't have to worry about termites, and it had the highest seismic 
rating available. There wasn't any waste, and all the pieces that were 
delivered were straight and true, so my walls will be straight. What more could 
I ask for?" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Busk has shown his house, which still is in the framing stages, to dozens of 
architects and builders, as well as to a number of people who lost homes in the 
disastrous Laguna Beach and Topanga Canyon fires of October. 
</P>
<P>
 "My clients are becoming converts because I'm using the house as a showcase," 
he said. "I've switched two of them from wood to steel in the last month.' 
</P>
<P>
 The total construction bill for the 2,600-square-foot stucco home will be 
about $5,000 more than if it had been framed with wood. But Busk said most of 
the extra cost came from his decision to cover the entire roof area twice -- 
once with corrugated steel and again with plywood. The steel is for fire safety 
and structural integrity, he said. The plywood "will make it easier to fasten 
down the clay roofing tile without having to use special fasteners." 
</P>
<P>
 Busk also paid a structural engineer to go over the framing design and 
incurred some costs in the extra time it took his framing contractor's crew to 
get comfortable working with metal. But the extras "aren't that much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I figure that's $5,000 I'll never have to spend getting the house fumigated 
and repairing termite damage, so in the long run the costs are a wash."

A LITTLE MOISTURE DOES A LOT OF GOOD FOR COMFORT, HEALTH

 Moisturizing the air in your home can help you feel more comfortable and 
breathe easier all winter long. But too much humidity can be harmful, 
especially if you have asthma or allergies. Here's how to strike a balance: 
</P>
<P>
 Winter air is naturally dry, and once you turn on the furnace, the situation 
gets worse. These arid conditions irritate sensitive membranes in your nose and 
leave you more susceptible to assaults from viruses and allergens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dry air triggers asthma and nasal congestion," says Dr. Marshall Plaut, chief 
of the asthma and allergy branch at the National Institute of Allergy and 
Infectious Diseases, a part of the National Institutes of Health. If you suffer 
frequent winter colds or allergy attacks, low humidity may be the culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding moisture to the air -- experts favor 35% relative humidity -- turns the 
tables on irritants. Humidification can help relieve your stuffy nose and itchy 
eyes, and it may ease asthma. Many people, including children, simply feel more 
comfortable with moisture in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 If you rarely suffer jolts of static electricity when you touch metal objects 
such as doorknobs, then the air in your home is probably humid enough. 
</P>
<P>
 For a more precise test, you'll need a hygrometer. You can find these humidity 
measuring devices at most hardware stores for about $8. Humidity between 35% 
and 45%, but not more than 50%, is an acceptable range. 
</P>
<P>
 There are inexpensive ways to raise your home's humidity -- green plants and 
trays filled with pebbles and water, for example. But for most folks, the 
easiest and most effective route is a power humidifier. 
</P>

 Free-standing humidifiers moisturize a single room or a section of your home. 
Small, portable humidifiers are easy to truck from room to room. The larger 
console models humidify larger areas but are too heavy to move easily. Expect 
to pay anywhere from $100 for a portable unit to $1,000 or more for the largest 
consoles. 
</P>
<P>
 Central humidifiers attach to your heating system and offer whole-house 
moisturizing. These units draw their water from your plumbing system, so they 
don't require constant refilling. Buying and installing a central humidifier 
will cost anywhere from $200 to $3,000 depending on the size of the unit needed 
for your home and the complexity of installation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, doctors often recommended humidifiers to combat symptoms 
arising from dry air. Today, that advice is tempered by two areas of concern: 
</P>
<P>
 * Dust mites. Many people are allergic to the waste products of these tiny, 
insect-like creatures. "You can't see them," says Michael Kaliner, head of 
allergic disorders at NIAID, "but they are found wherever the temperature is 
more than 60 degrees F and the humidity is 50% or more." 
</P>
<P>
 * Bacteria and mold. Humidifiers not properly maintained can become very 
efficient at producing and distributing illness-inducing organisms. Dirty water 
reservoirs and scaly, mineral-encrusted equipment offer an ideal environment 
for the growth of mold, mildew and other allergy-inducing fungi. 
</P>
<P>
 If you repeatedly have symptoms that mimic pneumonia or flu, your problems may 
be linked to the poorly maintained humidifier, say Dr. Harriet Burge of the 
Harvard School of Public Health. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the health problems associated with humidifiers can be prevented. Most 
important is to avoid over-humidifying your home. Room-size units rarely lead 
to excess humidity. Central units usually have controls to limit the amount of 
moisture they release. An occasional check with a hygrometer will ensure that 
your systems are adjusted properly.

DECORATING; SMALL ACCESSORIES CAN ADD LOADS OF PIZAZZ TO ROOMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They're the cream in your coffee, the spice in your apple pie. Accessories are 
important ingredients in a tasteful room, and they usually don't cut too deep 
into the budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The current emphasis is on finishing touches that look more original than 
canned. If there's an aspect of nature, so much the better. 
</P>
<P>
 Ceramic dishes made to look like vegetables or fruit are a favorite of 
decorator Howard Slatkin. He puts them on tabletops, on fireplace mantels and 
dining tables. A collection of plates might also grace a dining room or 
living-room wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who doesn't love fruit and vegetables?" Slatkin asks. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a long tradition of ceramics in the shape of cabbages, lettuce leaves 
and the like. They were made in French faience, Italian majolica and by English 
and middle European potters. Between antiques and copies, pieces are widely 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 If not the look of nature, why not its aroma? 
</P>
<P>
 "Scented candles and potpourri make you feel better," Slatkin says. "It's 
something most people overlook because they use their eyes to the exclusion of 
their other senses." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The secret of extracting the aroma from potpourri is to place it near a heat 
source, such as a lamp light. The heat releases the aroma. Potpourri scent will 
last about a month. Then, for a quick refresher, spritz it with a very small 
dose of room spray or a drop of essential oil. The same shops that sell 
potpourri usually sell room spray and vials of oils. Subtlety is the watchword; 
too much scent can be cloying. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep potpourri fragrant longer, store it in a covered container and take 
the cover off only when you want to perfume the air. Slatkin cautions against 
using home fragrance in the kitchen and dining room because it can interfere 
with the aroma of food. 
</P>
<P>
 Decorator Victoria Hagan says her favorite finishing touch is fresh flowers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of a grand arrangement once a month, I prefer to have a smaller 
arrangement each week," she says. "It's part of accessorizing a home for me to 
buy vases for my clients and to encourage them to fill them with flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan's idea of a small arrangement is a few flowers in a juice glass or an 
interesting container with a single flower. The latter, she says, is often just 
as effective as a large, expensive arrangement in a nondescript vase. 
</P>
<P>
 "I might have two bunches of different flowers, say separate bunches of 
daffodils and tulips, on the same table," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan also likes unusual containers. They can be an inexpensive accessory, 
especially if grouped -- small to large in different colors and materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "Vases look beautiful without flowers, almost like sculpture sitting on a 
tabletop," she says. "For example, a cut glass vase that dates from the 1930s 
sits on a table in my office with nothing in it. It has personality. That's 
what I look for in vases. I might buy a teapot that's a little chipped and use 
it for flowers." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagan regularly rearranges the vases on display in her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a good idea to move them around in a room and to change the type of 
arrangement -- one time a large bouquet, the next time, a miniature," she says. 
"Having a wardrobe of containers gives you that flexibility." 
</P>
<P>
 These suggestions, of course, merely scratch the surface. Taste in accessories 
is a little like fingerprints -- each person's is unique. If the world of 
nature doesn't seem exciting, almost anything else will do as long as it's 
personal. Adding a bit of trim to curtains, seating or the wall raises the room 
above the ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 Slatkin says you might use a hot glue gun to add ready-made tape to a pillow. 
Or you can add a hand-painted design to pillows. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a simple stencil, a realistic flower or any number of different 
ideas," Slatkin says. "The point is to show that there has been thought and 
care and attention to detail. It's the fact that the design is a unique 
personal expression that makes the difference."

EQUIPMENT; RISE ABOVE ACCIDENTS WITH SAFE USE OF LADDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most homes need two kinds of ladders: a stepladder for heights up to 10 feet 
and an extension ladder for greater heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure a stepladder has grooved treads, rubber or plastic non-slip safety 
shoes, and angled metal braces on the lowest tread. On an extension ladder look 
for a reinforced bottom rung as well as pivoting non-slip safety shoes and a 
device that locks the two sections together firmly. 
</P>
<P>
 If a ladder's rungs or steps aren't skid resistant, buy adhesive-backed 
anti-slip strips from a hardware store and apply them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladders are available in wood, aluminum or fiberglass -- the last being the 
costliest but the safest. (Fiberglass protects against accidental electrical 
shock.) 
</P>
<P>
 Buy a ladder that's rated Type I (heavy duty -- each rung is capable of 
supporting 250 pounds) or Type II (medium duty -- 225 pounds per rung). Or for 
300-pound support, buy Industrial IA. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some tips for the safe use of ladders: 
</P>
<P>
 When moving a ladder, avoid overhead wires. A metal or wet wood ladder that 
touches a power line can give a lethal shock. When on a metal ladder, use 
grounded double-insulated power tools only. 
</P>
<P>
 Position an extension ladder so that the distance between its base and the 
wall is one-quarter of the ladder's length up to its point of support. Don't 
lean a ladder against a window or a door. 
</P>
<P>
 When you open an extension ladder, make sure that there's at least three feet 
of overlap. Set the rung locks. 
</P>
<P>
 To raise an extension ladder, stand the ladder against the wall and lift the 
top end, rung by rung to the desired length, at least three feet above working 
level. 
</P>
<P>
 When climbing up or down, face the ladder and hold on with at least one hand. 
Haul tools up in a bucket after you are set, or carry them on a tool belt. 
</P>
<P>
 Make sure your hips stay within the side rails. Many falls from a ladder are 
caused by overreaching. Don't lean out. Move the ladder instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Open a stepladder fully, and fully lock the braces. 
</P>
<P>
 Before climbing an extension ladder, jump up and down lightly on the bottom 
rung to ensure rungs are firmly planted. 
</P>
<P>
 On muddy ground, drive a 2-by-4 stake into the ground behind the extension 
ladder. Then tie a rope around the second rung from the bottom and secure it to 
the stake. 
</P>
<P>
 When working high on a ladder against the house, lash the ladder through an 
open window so that it can't fall over. Tie one end of a rope to a rung, about 
two-thirds of the way up, and the other end to a radiator or other solid object 
inside. Or tie the rope to a 2-by-4 long enough to bridge the inside of the 
window. Pad the 2-by-4 to avoid marring the interior window frame. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall grips on ladder tops prevent slipping, and ladder-leg extensions can 
compensate for uneven ground. Or, on uneven ground, put a firm, flat block 
under a ladder's lower foot. On soft ground, place a wide board under both 
ladder feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't lean a ladder on an aluminum or vinyl gutter. Use a tall stepladder. Or 
add a U-shaped stabilizer to your extension ladder to hold it out from the 
wall.

GARDENING; CONTAINERS HOLD LOTS OF PLUSES FOR PLANTINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Containers often make it easier to cope with gardening problems such as 
weather, marginal soil, lack of space, weeds, pests, watering or too little or 
too much sun. 
</P>
<P>
 They are a major plus, too, when it becomes difficult to work at ground level. 
</P>
<P>
 Vegetables and containers seem made for each other. Although many flowers and 
shrubs also do well in them, containers really shine in producing vegetables. 
And the ornamental appearance of many vegetables is another advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about any vegetable -- even sweet corn and potatoes -- will produce a 
crop in a container. But fast growers usually are best. Most satisfactory are 
those that develop fruit over a long period of time, such as tomatoes, eggplant 
and peppers, or are harvested by picking outer leaves, such as leaf lettuce and 
herbs. They continue to grow and produce as you harvest. 
</P>
<P>
 With temperature-sensitive plants, containers can be rolled outdoors on warm, 
sunny days and back indoors at night. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain basics must always be followed: 
</P>
<P>
 * Probably the most important: Varieties must be suitable to your climate and 
the time of year during which you plan to grow them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Next, buy or make an artificial soil mix. Regular garden soil, regardless of 
how good it is, will not work well in containers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Never forget that vegetables need to be in a state of growth for best 
quality. This means close attention to watering and fertilizing. 
</P>
<P>
 * And remember that although vegetables prefer at least six hours of daily 
sunshine, most dislike heat -- and containers in full sun can get quite hot, 
cooking the roots. Avoid western exposures and windy places. 
</P>
<P>
 Just about any type of container will work. If it can hold sufficient growing 
material and its appearance pleases you, the plants should be happy. Be sure 
there are drain holes. 
</P>
<P>
 The five-gallon containers that nursery plants come in are a good starting 
point. Three-gallon size usually is minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 Many gardeners like the wooden half-barrels because they are large enough to 
hold several plants and retain a good moisture reserve. 
</P>
<P>
 Potatoes do fine in them. Leaf lettuce, peppers, green onions, shallots, 
garlic, herbs, tomatoes and carrots are excellent. Use dwarf varieties when 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 One caution: Before filling the containers with soil mix, place them where you 
want them. Otherwise, they may be too heavy to move. The mix must drain well 
and remain light and open. With only a few containers, it's simpler to buy a 
commercial mix. 
</P>
<P>
 Homemade is cheaper, and you can be sure of what's in it. A good proportion is 
equal parts of coarse sand, peat moss, vermiculite and perlite. This encourages 
strong roots. Before mixing, add horticulture lime and soil sulfur or gypsum. 
</P>
<P>
 Leave an inch or two of top space that can be filled with water at each 
watering. 
</P>
<P>
 Another plus with a soilless mix is that insects, diseases and weeds often are 
nonexistent. 
</P>
<P>
 For fertilizer, slow-release types work well. Many gardeners prefer applying a 
nutrient-balanced solution when watering. But remember that while leafy 
vegetables require heavy fertilization, fruiting vegetables grow a lot of 
foliage and produce poorly if given excess nitrogen. 
</P>
<P>
 Use the manufacturer's recommendation as a starting point, and observe 
carefully before adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
 If light comes only from one side, revolve the container a quarter turn each 
week, if this is possible. Black containers, by attracting sun in a sunny 
location, provide an early jump on summer. But be careful of this later in the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Determining watering needs can be difficult. Moisture meters are inexpensive. 
Another option: Stick a finger into the growing medium up to the first knuckle. 
If the finger feels moist when removed, try again the next day.

ASK THE HANDYMAN / JOHN MORELL: APPLYING THE 2ND COAT OF PAINT IS NO SWEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Question: I've got three bedrooms I'll be painting soon, and I want to do them 
all within a weekend. I'd like to cover them with second coats a few hours 
after applying the first coats, but I've been told it's best to wait at least 
24 hours. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
 S.V. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: "Here in Southern California, you don't need to follow those rules," 
says a representative of Tustin Paint Mart. "For areas with high humidity, you 
should wait at least overnight to allow the paint to dry. But here, lots of our 
days are warm and have low humidity, which allows you to re-coat after just 
four to six hours. I hope you have someone helping you to do the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My 1984-built condo has a textured drywall throughout that I'd like to 
smooth and get rid of. I considered getting a belt sander but was told that 
this would damage the drywall. Any suggestions? 
</P>
<P>
 R.E. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente 
</P>
<P>
 A: "I agree, taking a belt sander to the walls will probably do more harm than 
good," says contractor Bob Walters of Santa Ana. "The walls are paper over 
gypsum, so by doing some hard sanding you could damage them. Rather than 
replacing the drywall, you could coat the walls with a plastering product that 
will give you the smoothness you're looking for." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: After a large tree was removed from our back yard, our bedroom has made a 
complete transformation. The large window that was heavily shaded by the tree 
now lets in lots of light. We like the new brightness, but I'm worried that my 
expensive linens and wallpaper will fade. Can film be applied to the window 
that cuts out some of the light to protect fabrics? 
</P>
<P>
 N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange 
</P>
<P>
 A: "These glass films are available through hardware stores, but I'm not 
convinced that they're effective," says Richard Morales of Westminster Glass & 
Mirror. "They tend to shrivel and crack over time, leaving them ineffective. A 
better way to protect against fading is to use what's called Low-E glass. This 
is a replacement glass that has no tint, but it blocks the ultraviolet rays 
that cause fading. It's a more expensive alternative than the film, but if 
you're concerned about your expensive drapes and furniture, it may be a good 
choice to protect your investment." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I had carpeting installed before Christmas, but during the holidays, with 
lots of people walking through the house, several spots turned up. I heard that 
you should wait at least a year before having a carpet cleaned. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
 E.E. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 
</P>
<P>
 A: "No, you can have a carpet cleaned immediately after it's been installed," 
says Tom Nicholas of Linbrook Carpets in Anaheim. "It may be too early for your 
carpeting to have already developed 'paths' where people have walked. You may 
want to try a spot cleaner approved by the manufacturer. Most carpets today 
have some type of fabric protectant, and when it's new it's in better condition 
and can resist stains, so just a cursory cleaning should do the job as long as 
it hasn't been spotted with any serious dyes or greases." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: My 10-year-old disposal has a great, quiet motor, but I think the blades 
are losing it. It takes a while for the waste to be cut up. I'd like to try and 
remove the blades and sharpen them or get new ones. Is this a big job? 
</P>
<P>
 W.S. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 A: "It's probably more trouble than it's worth," says Manny Gwartz of B.J. 
Discount Plumbing and Heating Supply in Garden Grove. "When a disposal that old 
begins acting up, it's time to get a new one. You can fiddle with your unit and 
try to remove the blades, but there's probably another problem just waiting to 
happen. At today's prices, you can find a good quality disposal for under $100, 
and fixing your unit could cost the same amount."

9TH DEFENDANT CONVICTED IN INSURANCE FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE TAMAKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman who pleaded no contest Friday to conspiracy to commit insurance fraud 
became the ninth defendant to be convicted in a fraud ring that allegedly set 
up crashes with large trucks on the Golden State Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Reina Ruth Castillo, appearing in Los Angeles Superior Court, is one of 30 
defendants indicted in October, 1992, who were associated with the fraud ring, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Max Huntsman said. Castillo was an insurance claimant in a 
"paper accident," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an accident that never happened," Huntsman said. The phony claim was 
filed by attorney Gary P. Miller, who is considered the mastermind of the ring, 
prosecutors said.  
</P>
<P>
 Miller and three other defendants -- Jorge Sanchez, Rubidia Lopez and Isiais 
Antonio Aguilar Martinez -- also face murder charges for an accident that 
killed one man, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 30 defendants named in the indictment, so far nine have been convicted, 
13 are headed for trial and eight others face outstanding arrest warrants, 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Barry Thorpe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities uncovered the ring following a June, 17, 1992, crash that killed 
Jose Luis Lopez Perez, 29, a passenger in a car driven by Sanchez, who is 
accused by prosecutors of provoking a crash with a car carrier truck on the 
Golden State Freeway, causing the truck to flip over and crush the back of the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash was a deadly example of a chain of similar staged wrecks involving 
big rigs, marking a frightening escalation of the relatively common staged 
crashes on city streets, according to authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Florence-Marie Cooper on Friday fined Castillo $200 and 
sentenced her to three years probation, with the condition that if Castillo 
does not violate her probation, the conspiracy charge will be reduced to a 
misdemeanor and dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 The other defendants who have all either pleaded guilty or no contest to 
insurance fraud charges have received similar sentences. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Oscar Portillo, the owner of the car involved in the fatal crash, has 
received the toughest sentence of any of the defendants, Thorpe said: two years 
in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've asked for more time than they've been given," said Thorpe. "But 
obviously our primary defendant is Gary Miller and we're really satisfied with 
how that prosecution is going." 
</P>
<P>
 A trial-setting hearing for Miller, Lopez, Martinez and some of the other 
defendants has been set for March 14.

CARD WARS; VISA DEAL HAS AMERICAN EXPRESS FUMING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE GELLENE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Chef won't take The Card anymore -- and American Express is mad. 
</P>
<P>
 In its latest skirmish with Visa, American Express has accused its rival of 
striking a secret deal with celebrity chef Wolfgang Puck. American Express says 
Puck agreed to drop its card at two restaurants in return for "millions of 
dollars in advertising" from Visa for Puck's Malibu restaurant, Granita. Visa 
plans to run television ads beginning next week saying Granita won't accept the 
American Express card. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Puck acknowledged the deal with Visa, but said that the famed 
chef -- who did for pizza what Evian has done for water -- had planned to drop 
the American Express card anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "It costs us twice as much (as Visa) to take the American Express card," said 
Tom Kaplan, managing general partner of Spago, Puck's trendy pizzeria on Sunset 
Boulevard, which stopped accepting the American Express card Dec. 1. "Like 
everyone else, we are constantly faced with having to control our costs, and 
this is a cost we can control." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Visa spokesman Gregory Holmes: "We don't have to pay merchants not to 
accept American Express." 
</P>
<P>
 American Express launched its attack via advertisements appearing in Friday's 
editions of the Los Angeles Times, the San Francisco Chronicle and two 
entertainment industry journals, Daily Variety and the Hollywood Reporter. In 
its ad, American Express not only fired at Visa, but took a shot at Puck as 
well, advising readers to "consider the thousands of other fine restaurants in 
the Los Angeles area that gladly welcome American Express." 
</P>
<P>
 The episode underscores the intensity of the competition for consumer charge 
dollars between Visa and American Express. In the last two years, Visa has been 
aggressively pursuing trendy restaurants and upscale merchants -- typical 
American Express customers -- in a bid for prestige and more corporate charge 
business. Meanwhile, American Express has been busy quelling discontent among 
some merchants who are annoyed with the company's higher payment processing 
fees. 
</P>
<P>
 American Express has also lost cardholders, especially with the advent of 
no-fee Visa and MasterCards. The number of cardholders fell 2.6% during the 
first nine months of last year, though American Express said some of that was 
due to an intentional effort to weed out poor accounts.

 Past marketing deals similar to the one Visa reached with Puck have triggered 
angry reaction from American Express. The company successfully sued Visa over a 
television commercial featuring the ski resort town of Telluride, Colo., 
forcing Visa to change the ad. American Express said the commercials falsely 
implied its card wasn't accepted anywhere in Telluride. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas O. Ryder, president of American Express' establishment services 
division, said the deal between Puck and Visa is "intended to disparage 
American Express broadly. At most, Visa will make $200,000 from those 
restaurants. Would you pay $1 million to get $200,000?"

KHAN DENIES DEALS INFLUENCED FIRED MUTUAL FUND MANAGER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Rafi M. Khan, the Beverly Hills stock promoter, denies that a star mutual fund 
manager fired last week amid controversy was influenced by their personal stock 
dealings. 
</P>
<P>
 Portfolio manager John Kaweske, who co-managed nearly half of the $10 billion 
in funds of industry giant Invesco Funds Group of Denver, was fired Jan. 5 for 
failing to report some of his own securities trades, including a 75,000-share 
stake in Irvine-based Cardiac Science, a medical equipment manufacturer that 
Khan touted. 
</P>
<P>
 Invesco is one of the largest institutional holders of stock in ICN 
Pharmaceuticals, which Khan is trying to take over in a bitter proxy fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaweske's dismissal has sparked a national debate about how well the 
mushrooming mutual fund industry controls the managers entrusted with $2 
trillion of the public's money. Industry watchers are particularly worried 
about the possibility of "front running," a practice in which fund managers 
profit at the expense of fund shareholders by trading in their own accounts 
before making trades for their funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Invesco denied that Kaweske did this, alleging only technical violations of 
internal reporting rules. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaweske contends that his only failing was in not getting the necessary 
paperwork on his personal trades to Invesco in the time required. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan's nearly year-old fight to unseat ICN founder Milan Panic, the former 
prime minister of Yugoslavia, will come to a head at a Feb. 1 annual meeting. 
Critics of Khan have pointed out that some of ICN's largest holders, such as 
Invesco and Chestnut Hill Management of Boston, could play an important role in 
the ongoing proxy fight because they hold large blocks of stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaweske, who invested for Invesco in several stocks pushed by Khan, bought 
75,000 shares of Cardiac Science for his own account without getting written 
permission from his employer, as required by Invesco rules. However, Khan said 
in an interview this week that Kaweske did not purchase Cardiac stock for 
Invesco's funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardiac Science was founded by Howard K. Cooper, who was selected by Khan to 
be on his ICN slate of directors if Khan wins the proxy fight. Cooper was not 
available for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Khan said he was "amazed" that Kaweske was fired, adding that he did not 
believe Kaweske would have exerted any influence over the ICN battle because of 
his personal holdings. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is an honorable, a good portfolio manager," Khan said. "There is no 
connection between me and Kaweske other than he is one of my clients." 
</P>
<P>
 Khan said that he brought Kaweske to Cardiac Science because as a small 
company, which has not recorded any revenue yet, it was too risky a stock for a 
mutual fund portfolio. 
</P>
<P>
 The Securities and Exchange Commission reportedly is examining Kaweske's 
personal records. 
</P>
<P>
 According to published reports, the SEC is also looking at the personal trades 
of several portfolio managers of Fidelity Investments, another frequent client 
of Khan's, to see if they were involved in front running.

 As the Channel Tunnel between England and France prepares to open, one wary 
ferry operator has come up with a way to defend its turf, or surf rather. With 
Big Macs. 
</P>
<P>
 Stena Sealink, which stands to lose millions of passengers on its 
Dover-to-Calais route, says a McDonald's restaurant will be available on its 
Stena Fantasia ferry by the end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 The tunnel, which opens May 8 to passenger traffic, is pitching a quicker 
crossing of the English Channel -- about 35 minutes. The boat takes an hour 
longer. 
</P>
<P>
 But, pointed out Gareth Cooper, Stena Sealink's managing director, families 
will be attracted by the ferry's new offering. "They'll never be able to buy a 
Big Mac on a Channel Tunnel train."

RIDING A BUMPY ROAD; DRIVER TRAINING SCHOOLS IN STATE FALL ON HARD TIMES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT SANDELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The fast lane to success was wide open when Oscar Leong started his own 
driving school in the early '70s, but now the road to riches is jammed with 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty years ago, Leong had few rivals and plenty of student drivers. But 
today, Oscar's Driving School in Chinatown must fight with more than 100 
schools for customers. As a result, Leong has had to slash his teaching staff 
to two, from 16. With driving school revenue at a trickle, Leong runs an income 
tax service on the side. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business is no good anymore," Leong said. "People cannot survive on running a 
driving school alone -- not without a struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 The reason: A buildup of driver training schools in recent years has led to a 
glut in California -- forcing owners to trim or shut down their operations as 
new competitors continue to enter the market. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a matter of simple supply and demand," said Roger Kraft, president of 
Drive Time Driving School in Fullerton. "There are just too many schools 
competing for too few students." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the number of licensed schools in California hit 350 -- second only 
to the 621 in New York, which faces a similar oversupply. Illegal operations 
have mushroomed in recent years, according to the Driving School Assn. of 
California, as have schools that target immigrant groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, few in the industry would have predicted hard times. In fact, 
many owners expected a jump in business from teen-agers, their primary 
customers, after the state stopped funding free driver training in public high 
schools. New driving schools started up; established ones hired instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the boom never materialized, and divvying up the market into so many 
pieces has forced schools to cut back. California Driving School, once the 
state's largest with 82 instructors, has pared its teaching ranks to 28. Other 
operations have gone bankrupt; the latest victim of note was Canoga Park-based 
Teen Auto Club, which closed in October after 22 years in business. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts by some schools to increase advertising, especially in high school 
newspapers, have met with only limited success. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this recession, people are more concerned with putting food on the table 
than paying for driving lessons," said George Hensel, author of the textbook 
"Happiness Is Having Your Own Driver's License" and owner of the California 
Driving School. "Many people regard it as a luxury." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the glut, new schools are still opening and gaining market share. Some 
do so legitimately, primarily by offering instruction to immigrants in their 
native languages -- from Spanish and Korean to Armenian and Tagalog. 
</P>
<P>
 "In this city, people speak so many different languages. As a driving school 
instructor, you have to also, so you can compete," said Leong, whose school 
prospered from teaching primarily Chinese immigrants in the '70s and '80s. 
"People are drawn to your business if you can speak their language." 
</P>
<P>
 But many of the new schools in Southern California compete by operating 
without insurance or state licensing, which lets them charge prices as low as 
$60 for six hours of instruction. Comparable lessons at most legitimate schools 
cost between $150 and $300. 
</P>
<P>
 Complaints about fly-by-night operations are up, said Vito Scattaglia, an 
investigator with the Department of Motor Vehicles. And almost all of them come 
from the owners of licensed schools facing dwindling enrollments. 
</P>
<P>
 "The competition is getting to them," Scattaglia said. "When everybody's 
making money, nobody's going to complain. Now, all of a sudden, the owners are 
starting to become more vocal about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The fight for students has also pitted driving school owners against the 
public schools. Many public systems, including the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, began charging for driver training after they lost state funding in 
1990. But lawsuits by the Driving School Assn. of California have forced them 
to offer the courses for free or not at all. In 1992, a court said driver 
training fees in public high schools violate a clause in the state Constitution 
that provides for free education. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite the legal victories, most driving schools have seen no increase in 
business. As it turns out, many teen-agers are waiting until they turn 18 to 
get their driver's licenses, according to the DMV. Adults aren't subject to the 
driver training requirement, and school owners speculate that some teens, or 
their parents, want to avoid paying for driving lessons altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have changed their minds about driving lessons," Leong said. "They're 
all trying to learn by themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 That attitude is worrisome, school operators say, for reasons beyond the 
bottom line. Many observers say driving without a license is on the rise -- 
especially among teen-agers. And, even if motorists have a license, school 
owners say drivers rarely receive enough safety training if taught by friends 
or relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Business keeps going down year after year," Leong said. "But maybe it's worse 
for people on the road."

DOW CORNING EXPECTING $1.24-BILLION IMPLANT TAB; LAWSUITS: IT IS THE COMPANY'S 
FIRST DISCLOSURE OF POTENTIAL LIABILITY IN THE CASE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID R. OLMOS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dow Corning Corp. said Friday that legal and other problems related to 
silicone breast implants will cost $1.24 billion -- the first time the former 
implant manufacturer has disclosed its potential liability in the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Corning also said it would take a pretax fourth-quarter charge of $640 
million -- or $415 million after taxes -- to cover its potential liability from 
breast implant settlement talks. The company said it expects about half of the 
$1.24 billion amount will be covered by its insurance carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 A 50-50 joint venture of Dow Chemical Co. and Corning Inc., Dow Corning was 
the world's largest maker of silicone breast implants until it stopped 
manufacturing them in 1992. The Midland, Mich., company also supplied silicone 
gel to many other implant makers for decades. It has been named as a defendant 
in more than 6,800 lawsuits relating to silicone breast implants, whose use has 
been restricted by the Food and Drug Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, lawyers representing defendants and plaintiffs in implant 
lawsuits proposed a $4.75-billion fund to compensate women who claim they were 
physically or emotionally harmed by implants. 
</P>
<P>
 But the parties have missed several court-imposed deadlines for reaching a 
final agreement because of disputes among defendants over their individual 
contributions to the settlement fund. Other defendants at the center of the 
discussions are manufacturers Bristol-Myers Squibb and Baxter International 
Inc.  
</P>
<P>
 Gary Anderson, a Dow Corning executive vice president, said lawyers for both 
sides have made "good progress" in resolving the differences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're feeling better about it, and I'm hoping we're looking at weeks instead 
of months" until a final agreement is struck. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson said the settlement cost may actually be higher than $1.24 billion 
because that estimate is based on present values. The proposed settlement would 
require companies to pay into the fund over a 30-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street welcomed the Dow Corning disclosure as better defining the 
liability for the Michigan firm and its parent companies. Investors have 
generally applauded the breast implant manufacturer's decision to pursue a 
large class-action settlement as an alternative to battling thousands of 
individual lawsuits in state and federal court. 
</P>
<P>
 Dow Chemical shares rose 50 cents to $58.875 on the New York Stock Exchange on 
Friday, while Corning shares were up 37.5 cents to $31.125. Dow Corning shares 
are not publicly traded. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, Corning said it would take an after-tax charge of $203 million to 
cover its part of the settlement costs. Dow Chemical estimated that the Dow 
Corning charges would negatively affect its fourth-quarter earnings by $192 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 It is estimated that more than 1 million women have received silicone breast 
implants. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the September proposal, women with an implant who have been found to 
have one of eight diseases would collect from $200,000 to $2 million. The eight 
diseases are scleroderma, systemic lupus, mixed connective tissue disease, 
polymyositis and dermatomyositis, primary Sjogren's disease, atypical 
neurological disease and atypical connective tissue disease/atypical rheumatic 
syndrome.

MOTOROLA TO SPEND $10 MILLION, HIRE IN IRVINE; INDUSTRY: PLANT AFFECTED WAS 
PURCHASED FROM WESTERN DIGITAL. MAYOR HAILS THE ANOUNCEMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Motorola Inc. said Friday that it plans to hire additional employees and 
invest $10 million this year in a semiconductor chip factory it purchased from 
Western Digital Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Company executives said at a ribbon-cutting ceremony that they would add only 
15 workers to the plant's 390-person staff this year. But in the next two 
years, Motorola expects to expand the staff to more than 500 people, said John 
Docherty, Motorola's site manager of the plant. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make use of every square inch of this plant," said Docherty, 
who is moving from Motorola's plant in East Kilbride, Scotland, to Orange 
County. "This expansion will help the county." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Motorola's Phoenix-based Semiconductor Products Sector completed 
its purchase of the plant -- arguably the most sophisticated factory in Orange 
County and the only chip factory built locally in the last decade -- for $111 
million. Motorola hired most of the Western Digital employees, except for 60 
who continue to work at Irvine-based Western Digital. 
</P>
<P>
 The chip plant produces six-inch semiconductor wafers, which are platters of 
silicon circuitry that are cut into individual computer chips. The chips, which 
are the building blocks of all modern electronics, are packaged in plastic 
material and are assembled into working chips in Malaysia or Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a three-year agreement, the plant will continue to make computer chips 
for Western Digital's products, such as disk drives and circuit boards. But 
Motorola intends to convert it into a high-volume factory, making chips for a 
vast array of electronic equipment, such as pagers, cellular phones, 
automobiles, computers and radios. 
</P>
<P>
 After the expansion in 1994, the plant will be able to make 2,500 wafers a 
week, said Gene Mullinnix, a manager with Motorola's Microcontroller 
Technologies Group in Austin, Tex., the division that will be in charge of the 
plant's production. 
</P>
<P>
 That compares to 1,800 wafers a week now. By 1996, Mullinnix said, the plant 
should be able to make 5,000 wafers a week. Once new equipment is added in 
1995, Docherty said, the plant might begin hiring additional staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "We expect to spend tens of millions of dollars in the future here and begin 
staffing heavier in 1995," said Gary Daniels, a Motorola senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is important because it shows that California is serious about keeping 
the manufacturing base we have here," said Irvine Mayor Michael Ward. "It's not 
every day you welcome a $17-billion company to your city."

STOCKS STAGE BROAD RALLY; ASIA TRADING SURGES BACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Market Overview * Stocks jumped to new highs as another strong buying wave 
swept Wall Street. A rebound in Asian markets helped buoy sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bond yields inched up, responding to more signs of economic strength. Some 
commodity prices leaped as a new cold wave bore down on the Midwest and East. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks  
</P>
<P>
 The 1994 rally picked up a new head of steam, helped by computer-guided 
program trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrials, off 23 points over the previous three sessions, jumped 
24.77 points to 3,867.20, topping the prior peak of 3,865.51 reached Monday. 
For the week, the Dow added 46.43 points. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, demand for stocks was broad and deep Friday: Winners topped 
losers 12 to 9 on the New York Stock Exchange and 15 to 11 on the Nasdaq 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nasdaq composite index of mostly smaller stocks surged 4.50 points to a 
record 792.31. On Thursday, the index had reached a new high for the first time 
since last Oct. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said Wall Street was cheered Friday by more indications of a 
strengthening economy, and by some better-than-expected quarterly earnings 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The encouraging economic backdrop is a virtual siren call for stock mutual 
funds and pension funds to buy stocks, experts say. And because many funds are 
flush with new cash since the year began, there is plenty of ammunition for a 
rally. 
</P>
<P>
 "Investors are interpreting the environment as the best of all possible 
worlds," with low interest rates, low inflation and solid corporate profits, 
said Anthony Dwyer, strategist at Sherwood Securities. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Motorola, up 3 1/4 on Thursday after it reported quarterly earnings that 
topped estimates, added 1 to 99. Other tech stocks rallying included 
Hewlett-Packard, up 2 to 87 1/2; Autodesk, up 2 1/4 to 44 3/4; Texas 
Instruments, up 3 to 72 1/2; Creative Technologies, up 2 to 36 1/2; and Xircom, 
up 3/4 to 19 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Industrials leading the Dow up included DuPont, up 1 1/4 to 52 3/8; GE, up 1 
1/2 to 106 3/4; Goodyear, up 2 1/4 to 47 1/4; and GM, up 1 to 61 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Disney also helped the Dow: It shot up 1 5/8 to 47 5/8 on new optimism about 
Euro-Disney's future. 
</P>
<P>
 * Many telecommunications issues continued to rebound. Ericsson leaped 3 3/8 
to 45 1/2, 3Com surged 1 3/8 to 51, DSC Communications jumped 1 3/8 to 68 7/8 
and Newbridge Networks added 7/8 to 67 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, Optical Radiation gained 1/2 to 17 1/2. Benson 
Eyecare of Rye, N.Y., said it has taken a 6.2% stake in Optical. Benson tried 
to talk merger with Optical in 1993 but was rebuffed. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kaufman & Broad Home fell 7/8 to 23 5/8 after reporting 
lower-than-expected earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 In foreign markets, Mexico City's Bolsa index fell 48.90 points to 2,486.68 as 
profit-takers hit again. 
</P>
<P>
 But Asian markets posted strong gains after recent heavy losses. Hong Kong's 
Hang Seng index jumped 597.74 points to 10,774.25, while Singapore's Straits 
Times index shot up 108 points to 2,302.86. In Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, the 
composite index surged 104.97 points, or 10%, to 1,134.14. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other markets, Tokyo's Nikkei index rose 396.44 points to 18,973.70, 
London's FTSE-100 soared 40.6 points to 3,400.6 and Frankfurt's DAX eased 22.84 
points to 2,141.82. 
</P>
<P>
 Other Markets  
</P>
<P>
 Bond yields rose moderately as some investors backed away, spooked by the 
latest signs of economic strength. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's 30-year bond rose to 6.29% from 6.25% on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Reserve said industrial production jumped 0.7% in December, nearly 
double expectations. Also, a University of Michigan survey showed consumer 
optimism surged in January. 
</P>
<P>
 In other markets: 
</P>
<P>
 * Crude oil, heating oil, natural gas, hog and cattle futures rose, as a new 
Arctic blast headed for the Midwest and East -- boosting fuel demand and 
stranding livestock. 
</P>
<P>
 * Near-term gold futures closed at $389.50 an ounce on the New York Comex, off 
50 cents. Silver added 3 cents to $5.21.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Underscoring the continuing impact of federal defense retrenchment in Southern 
California, Aerospace Corp., a Torrance research and development center for the 
Defense Department, will lay off about 200 employees at the end of January, the 
company announced Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts, resulting from defense budget cuts, amount to about 5.5% of the 
company's work force of 3,600 and will affect engineers as well as clerical and 
other administrative employees.Employees losing their jobs are set to be 
notified Friday, with the cuts becoming effective Jan. 28. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 150,000 aerospace-related jobs in Southern California have been lost 
in the last five years. 
</P>
<P>
 The cuts at Aerospace Corp., which provides sophisticated engineering and 
design services to the Air Force, are believed to be the first at that company 
in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 A nonprofit company funded entirely by the federal government, Aerospace Corp. 
said it was forced to reduce spending after a nearly 12% cut in its budget. 
According to a company representative, Aerospace's budget for the current 
fiscal year is about $363 million, approximately $49 million less than the 
previous fiscal year.

 Industrial Production Rises to 5-Year High: Output at the nation's factories, 
mines and utilities rose 4.2% last year, as measured by the Federal Reserve's 
industrial production index.That was the strongest increase since 1988 and 
followed a 2.3% rise in 1992 and a drop of 1.8% in 1991, a recession year. 
Production increased during each of the final seven months of the year, rising 
0.7% in December and 0.9% in November, which was the largest gain in a year. In 
December, production at factories rose 0.7%; at mines and oil fields, 0.5%; and 
at utilities, 1%.

13,000 CHOOSE TO FORGO PRUDENTIAL SETTLEMENT; LITIGATION: THE OFFER INVOLVES UP 
TO $120 MILLION IN CASH FOR ABOUT 130,000 INVESTORS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On the eve of today's deadline, more than 13,000 investors have chosen not to 
participate in a revised settlement of a class-action lawsuit over Prudential 
Securities' troubled oil and gas partnerships. 
</P>
<P>
 That is about 1,000 more investors than opted out of a much smaller settlement 
nearly a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The first offer -- of $37 million in cash -- was derailed last February by a 
federal judge. The new offer involves a maximum of $120 million in cash for the 
roughly 130,000 investors in Prudential's Energy Income Funds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 11 months since the original settlement fell apart, the partnerships 
have been sold to Parker & Parsley Petroleum for $491 million. That sum, along 
with the settlement and the cash distributions paid by the partnerships over 
the years, means investors would get back about 80% of their original 
investment. 
</P>
<P>
 But investors' lawyers have said many customers still stand to do better by 
electing not to participate and instead pursuing one of two other options -- 
arbitration against Prudential or a claim under a procedure established as part 
of Prudential's $371-million settlement with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 The deadline for mailing opt-out forms is midnight tonight, and the final 
count is expected to exceed the 13,253 received as of the most recent tally, 
completed midday Thursday, according to Edward A. Grossman, a lawyer for 
Prudential investors.

AT&T MOVE CREATES FOURTH-QUARTER LOSS; EARNINGS: COMPANY SETS ASIDE $1.3 
BILLION TO COMPLY WITH NEW ACCOUNTING RULES. FIGURE ALSO REFLECTS COSTS 
ASSOCIATED WITH NCR RESTRUCTURING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 AT&T said Friday it will set aside $1.3 billion to comply with new accounting 
rules that chiefly cover how severance payments are reflected on a company's 
books. 
</P>
<P>
 The move will reduce AT&T's fourth-quarter earnings after taxes by about 96 
cents a share, resulting in a loss. Without it, the company said it would have 
earned $1.15 billion, or 85 cents a share, which would be in line with 
analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the accounting charges, AT&T said its 1993 results will also 
reflect about $120 million in costs associated with restructuring NCR Corp., 
its computer manufacturing subsidiary. NCR last fall offered early retirement 
incentives to 5,000 of its 27,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Accounting rules, which most public companies follow, impacted AT&T earlier in 
1993 as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first quarter, AT&T set aside $7 billion to comply with a new standard 
for the way retiree health benefits are accounted. With a small gain from 
adopting a new rule on federal tax liability, AT&T before Friday had accounting 
charges of $6.64 billion for the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding the charges, the company earned $3.11 billion, or $2.30 a share, in 
the first nine months of 1993, up 11% from a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The new rules come from the Financial Accounting Standards Board, a 
quasi-government body. 
</P>
<P>
 The board has given companies until their first fiscal quarter of 1994 to 
adopt the latest rule. 
</P>
<P>
 It says companies must regularly set aside amounts that estimate potential 
costs for severance or disability payments to all employees over the course of 
their working lives. Now, companies only set aside amounts that are actually 
paid to specific employees. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast to the rules on retiree benefits and tax liability, which affected 
most large companies, the impact of the new rule is less clear since companies 
have greater discretion in its application. 
</P>
<P>
 Before AT&T's announcement, the largest company to get attention for such a 
charge was General Electric, which set aside $1.3 billion before taxes in the 
second quarter of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T spokesman Dick Gray said the company's adoption of the rule reflects an 
acknowledgment that it expects to pay disability and severance benefits in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have any specific predictions about how many people will have 
disabilities or will leave with severance," Gray said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the NCR employees, AT&T has announced plans to cut 3,000 to 
4,000 telephone operator positions from April to early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said, however, that the charges would not affect the company's goal of at 
least 10% earnings growth. 
</P>
<P>
 AT&T stock closed up 37.5 cents at $54.50 on the New York Stock Exchange 
Friday.

WAL-MART TO ACQUIRE 120 WOOLCO STORES IN CANADA; RETAIL: THE U.S. COMPANY 
BROADENS ITS BASE FOR TRADE UNDER NAFTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wal-Mart Stores Inc. is continuing its march across North America by entering 
Canada with the purchase of 120 Woolco discount stores from Woolworth Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The No. 1 retailer, based in Bentonville, Ark., is already in a partnership 
with Mexico's largest retailer, Cifra. The purchase of the Woolco stores 
"allows them to get a very strong beachhead in Canada," Woody Whyte, a retail 
industry analyst with Stephens Inc., said Friday after the deal was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Details of the transaction were not released, but Woolworth said it will 
receive about $300 million in cash from the deal. The company also said it 
would take a $45-million charge to cover foreign currency losses, but it had 
not determined during which quarter the charge would be taken. 
</P>
<P>
 The acquisition, subject to Canadian regulatory approval, is expected to be 
finalized in March, Wal-Mart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart spokesman Don Shinkle said the recent passage of the North American 
Free Trade Agreement would facilitate its move into Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 "NAFTA is in the process of making the North American continent one market," 
Shinkle said. 
</P>
<P>
 Woolworth Vice President Frances Trachter said the sale is part of the 
company's strategy of focusing on small specialty stores, rather than large 
discount stores. Woolworth announced last year it was closing or revamping 970 
stores, including many discount stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our long-term vision is really to focus on specialty retailing, and this 
transaction is consistent with that," Trachter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canadian stores being sold generated about $1.3 billion in sales in 1993 
and "will give Wal-Mart an immediate and formidable presence in Canada," said 
Jeffrey M. Feiner, a stock analyst with Salomon Bros. Inc. in New York. "With 
the recent passage of NAFTA, Canada represents a very lucrative market for the 
discount store industry, of which only Zellers, and, to a lesser extent, Kmart 
represent the most formidable competition." 
</P>
<P>
 If the deal wins approval, Wal-Mart will sublease the Woolco stores from 
Woolworth Canada Inc. and buy most of the assets and inventory of the stores it 
is buying. Wal-Mart said it plans to hire most of the 16,000 Woolco employees 
in the stores it acquires and will hire additional new employees as its 
operation expands in Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart has more than 2,000 stores and 360 Sam's Club membership warehouse 
stores in 49 U.S. states, Puerto Rico and Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Wal-Mart's stock closed up 12.5 cents at $25.625 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Woolworth was up 50 cents at $25.625.

2 PLEAD GUILTY TO WOMAN'S DEATH IN FIGHT; COURTS: THE DEFENDANTS HAD BEATEN THE 
VICTIM, WHO A DOCTOR SAID DIED OF A HEART ATTACK DURING THE TRAFFIC DISPUTE IN 
LA HABRA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THUAN LE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Whittier woman and a La Habra girl pleaded guilty Friday to involuntary 
manslaughter in the death of a woman who had a heart attack during a fight at a 
La Habra shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Luker, 22, and Sara Ward, 17, face a maximum of three years in prison 
when they are sentenced Feb. 25 in Orange County Superior Court, Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
 They were being held in the Orange County Jail -- Luker on a $60,000 bail and 
Ward on a $50,000 bail. Ward was ordered to be tried as an adult last November. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors earlier had dropped charges that the defendants, who are white, 
committed a racially motivated hate crime when they beat 26-year-old Tina 
Roxanne Rodriguez, a black mother of four. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came after Dr. Joseph Hakla testified in November that Rodriguez 
was not beaten to death but had died of a heart attack caused by the stress of 
the fight. He said Rodriguez had suffered from Graves' disease, a thyroid 
condition that made her susceptible to heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
 A third defendant in the case, John Richard Collins, 25, of El Monte also 
pleaded guilty Friday to being an accessory to a felony and receiving stolen 
property. He was sentenced to 16 months in state prison, Rosenblum said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luker's lawyer, public defender Hector Chaparro, said his client had not 
expected the La Habra woman to die during the fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Luker pleaded guilty, he said, because she hopes the judge will see that she 
feels remorse and will show her leniency. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt she had a very viable defense of self-defense in this matter," 
Chaparro said. "We had developed a number of witnesses who would show that the 
victim actually instigated the fight and prolonged the fight. But (Luker) felt 
very badly about the whole incident. This wasn't how she expected it to turn 
out. She deserves probation, not more time in jail." 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenblum said the judge might be lenient because neither Luker nor Ward has a 
police record and they did not actually beat Rodriguez to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward's attorney could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred Sept. 2 as Rodriguez's friend was pulling out of a 
parking place at La Habra and Beach boulevards. Their car was almost hit by a 
vehicle driven by Collins, La Habra Police Detective Michael Mitchell 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins' car had been stolen from a dealership in August. He later told police 
he had bought it for $200 from the apparent thief, Mitchell said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Collins stopped to exit the parking lot, Rodriguez got out of her 
friend's car, walked toward Collins and asked him what his problem was, 
according to police. 
</P>
<P>
 Luker and Ward then jumped out of Collins' car and began beating Rodriguez, 
who suddenly collapsed, Mitchell testified. The women continued to beat her 
while Rodriguez was on the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins, who had stayed in the car, drove off once Luker and Ward got back 
inside, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutor Rosenblum said the case in the beginning was "over-reported" by 
police and the media and that Rodriguez only had a bruise over her right 
eyebrow from the fight.  
</P>
<P>
 Several witnesses had told police that the three defendants had yelled racial 
slurs as Rodriguez lay dying. But Rosenblum said other witnesses said no racial 
slurs were uttered by the defendants.

BRANCH ASSAILS COUNTY SUPERVISORS; POLITICS: EMBATTLED RECORDER AND HIS 
ATTORNEY SAY HE'S THE VICTIM OF A 'HIDDEN AGENDA' TO OUST HIM FROM OFFICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The misconduct investigations dogging Orange County Recorder Lee A. Branch are 
part of a "hidden agenda" by the Board of Supervisors and other top county 
officials who have sought to oust Branch and replace him with a candidate of 
their liking, the recorder and his attorney said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch vowed to seek a fifth term in office and "take back" control of his 
troubled department. 
</P>
<P>
 "The supervisors have attempted to intimidate Mr. Branch through false, 
spurious and non-meritorious allegations of wrongdoing," Branch's attorney, 
Lloyd Charton, said. "Lee Branch is not intimidated by coercion and cannot be 
bought off." 
</P>
<P>
 Branch, an elected official whose office is a repository for real estate and 
financial transactions, is the subject of a county investigation into 
allegations of sexual harassment, physical abuse and office mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 During a press conference at his lawyer's office, the recorder made his first 
extensive public comments since early in the investigation, which began in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding later to Branch's suggestion of a county conspiracy intent on 
seeking the recorder's removal, County Administrative Officer Ernie Schneider 
said: "That's ridiculous. It shows just how out of touch with reality he really 
is." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, one of Branch's employees attended the press conference to hear her 
boss answer the complaints against him. "I'm not satisfied," employee Patty 
Newcomb said afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomb was one of dozens of employees in the recorder's office interviewed by 
county affirmative action investigators, who handle such complaints. She told 
investigators that she was once grabbed by supervisor Nancy L. Smith, and that 
Smith strongly scolded her for making a mistake in the office. 
</P>
<P>
 A key part of the Branch investigation has centered on the recorder's personal 
relationship with Smith, a documents manager in the office. Employees have 
alleged that the relationship caused serious morale problems, and that Branch 
has shown favoritism to Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Branch again acknowledged his relationship with Smith but said he was 
unaware that it might have caused difficulties for others in the office. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will admit to a relationship with Smith that has been going on for some 
years," Branch said. "I am a single person and she is a single person. . . . 
The relationship was not brought into the office." 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Newcomb, the recorder said he did not witness the incident but 
became satisfied that there was no "intended abuse" of the employee. Branch 
said Smith's action was "merely an attempt to get the employee's attention." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Branch denied that the subsequent reprimand issued to Smith was 
delayed by any personal concern he had for her. Because of the relationship, 
Branch said he had asked the county counsel's office for direction on the 
matter. Ultimately, he said, the incident was handled "appropriately" by 
Assistant Recorder Ella M. Murphy. 
</P>
<P>
 In wake of the county's investigations, Murphy has said that Smith is expected 
to be transferred to another position in county government. Smith has also 
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Branch is back at work after a monthlong leave last year during the 
investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newcomb matter is among a number of allegations involving the recorder's 
office that are to be addressed in a forthcoming county report scheduled for 
public discussion by the Board of Supervisors Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the other claims are that Branch made lewd comments to a female worker 
and that he shoved another employee who had been seen talking with a union 
representative. There are also deep concerns, county officials have said, about 
allegations of general office mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Branch and his attorney, Lloyd Charton, generally denied the other 
allegations. Branch said he did recall a meeting with a female employee in his 
office to discuss her concerns, but said there was no use of "foul language." 
</P>
<P>
 "The allegations of sexual harassment are, basically, that Mr. Branch used 
inappropriate language on one occasion," attorney Charton said. "He does not 
use foul, four-letter words in his vocabulary, as that was not his upbringing. 
For 37 years, he has been a complete gentleman in the office." 
</P>
<P>
 Branch, who has held the position of recorder for 15 years, has spent his 
entire county government career in the obscure office. The recorder also said 
he had no recollection of ever shoving an employee out of anger. "I don't 
shove, push or hit employees," Branch said. "I don't condone that kind of 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Branch, however, did acknowledge that some management problems existed in the 
office and that he had not spoken with one top assistant for more than a year 
because of a past incident involving the computer systems manager. Branch 
declined to discuss the incident Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, Branch said his management problems are rooted in an 
inability to freely reassign or remove employees from the staff without 
encountering county-mandated personnel guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 Charton said the Board of Supervisors and other county officials have only 
made Branch's task more difficult by encouraging the investigation of 
"laughable" allegations in the hope that Branch would resign. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor William G. Steiner dismissed Branch's contentions, saying that 
problems in the recorder's office have been "longstanding." He also called the 
recorder's decision to seek reelection a "frightening thought." 
</P>
<P>
 "Because the office is so obscure," Steiner said. "I'm worried that the voters 
may not clearly understand his poor performance and will return him to office."

DAILY LESSON IN CIVIL RIGHTS; POIGNANT GROUNDBREAKING HELD FOR MARTIN LUTHER 
KING JR. ELEMENTARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 During a poignant ceremony filled with words of hope and equality, Santa Ana 
Unified School District officials Friday broke ground on the county's first 
school to be named after slain civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Several people wiped away tears during the midmorning ceremony as speakers 
recalled King's "I Have a Dream" speech and his pleas for brotherhood during 
the 1964 civil rights march from Selma to Montgomery, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Fran Williams, chairwoman of the Orange County Human Relations 
Commission, told the audience that naming an elementary school for King was 
especially appropriate because "he had an unwavering love and respect for 
children, all children. He looked upon them as humanity's greatest gift." 
</P>
<P>
 About 70 people, including school board members Sal Mendoza, Audrey 
Yamagata-Noji, Rob Balen and Rosemarie Avila and district Supt. Rudy Castruita, 
attended the groundbreaking of Martin Luther King Jr. Elementary School. The 
five-acre campus, at 1001 Graham Lane, is scheduled to open in fall, 1995. It 
will serve about 700 students in kindergarten through fifth grades, said 
district spokeswoman Diane Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 After spirituals sung by women from a local church, Rabbi Bernie King of the 
Shir Ha-Ma'Alot Harbor Reform Temple in Newport Beach described the civil 
rights leader during the march to Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 After witnessing "the hell of segregation" and racial prejudice during that 
march, "I had no idea at that time that 25 years later we'd be honoring King as 
one of the great Americans of this century," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The rabbi added later that the school could become a symbol "that will break 
down the barriers between races, religions and ethnic groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Praising the district for honoring King, Van Roberson, pastor of Greater Light 
Missionary Baptist Church in Santa Ana, said King's memory would encourage 
students to realize their own hopes and dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. King represented equality for all mankind. He inspired people to be the 
very best they could be," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Closing the ceremony, John McReynolds, senior pastor of the Second Baptist 
Church in Santa Ana, offered a dramatic recitation of King's "I Have a Dream" 
speech. The audience broke into applause when he concluded the speech with the 
words, "Free at last, free at last, thank God almighty, we're free at last." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials and several speakers then plunged shovels into a mound of 
earth and turned them over, formally breaking ground on a $12.7-million campus 
intended to help alleviate serious overcrowding at the district, which has 
about 49,000 students. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Unified is the county's largest school district and the eighth 
largest in the state. Since the late 1970s, the student population has been 
growing by about 1,000 students a year, and most district schools exceed their 
capacities. Because of the time it takes to get money for new school 
construction, the district uses 500 portable classrooms on campuses to meet the 
needs of students, Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the addition of King Elementary, the district is expected to open 
Pio Pico Elementary School next year, which will accommodate nearly 700 
students, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 King Elementary's classrooms will include a fiber-optic communication system, 
which will be able to transmit telephone, video and computer data signals. With 
the televisions mounted in each classroom, teachers will be able to call up 
educational videos from a central library, Thomas said.

PUBLIC POLICY THINK TANK TO BE ESTABLISHED AT NIXON LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK LANDSBAUM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Center for Peace and Freedom, a think tank to be unveiled next week at the 
Nixon Library and Birthplace, will be a public policy center unlike any other 
in the country, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Center for Peace and Freedom is going to be an organization that 
establishes some chairs that engage in the kind of policy study and . . . 
philosophical and strategic discussions over America's role in the world very 
much in the pattern of Richard Nixon," said attorney Ken Khachigian, a member 
of the library's board of directors and a former Nixon White House staffer. 
</P>
<P>
 The think tank's privately endowed chairs will operate in Orange County and 
Washington, Khachigian said. Details on the number of positions to be endowed, 
the areas of study and other specifics are being withheld until the formal 
announcement on Thursday, which is planned to coincide with the 25th 
anniversary of Nixon's first presidential inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will be "not just a physical structure (but also) a policy think 
tank . . . to carry the President's legacy over the years," Khachigian said. 
"It will be funded in the same manner as a foundation," he said, although he 
could provide no details on who the financial backers will be or how much money 
will be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Library officials have closely guarded the details of the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole ball of wax is going to come out next week, Thursday for sure," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Khachigian described the think tank as "a very substantial 
undertaking." 
</P>
<P>
 "Chairs will be endowed in basic areas of foreign policy inquiry and will 
engage the study of (America's) role in the world," he said. "And it will be 
balanced between various disciplines." 
</P>
<P>
 Possible areas of study, according to Khachigian, may include national 
security, strategic considerations, international finance and economics. The 
endowed chairs will function much like endowed chairs at universities, he said. 
Money will be provided to "support the work of individuals in certain areas," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With branches to be located in Yorba Linda and Washington, the center will be 
"dedicated to the pursuit of enlightened national interest and pragmatic 
idealism at home," library spokesman Kevin Cartwright said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The center will go beyond the scope of conventional think tanks, Cartwright 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's a public policy center unlike any that currently exists," he said. "The 
domestic policy aspect of the center will be just as important as any other 
aspect."  
</P>
<P>
 Nixon, along with luminaries from his Administration, including his successor 
in the White House, Gerald R. Ford, and former Cabinet members Henry A. 
Kissinger, George P. Shultz, and Caspar W. Weinberger, are scheduled to be 
present at the library for Thursday's celebration.

TASK FORCE SEEKS NEW WAYS TO STEER SOLO DRIVERS OFF ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Moving toward overhauling one of its most far-reaching and unpopular efforts 
to combat smog, the Southland's air quality board on Friday formed a task force 
to search for new ways to remove solo commuters from the region's roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by the South Coast Air Quality Management District board was 
applauded by many businesses that have complained for years that they have 
unfairly had to shoulder the burden of trying to revolutionize the way Southern 
Californians commute. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to forming the task force, the board voted to allow businesses to 
delay implementing new ride-sharing incentives as long as they still meet their 
current goals. The agency's enforcement staff also was directed to issue 
warning notices -- instead of imposing fines -- when businesses do not fulfill 
ride-sharing requirements, unless the violations are "clearly flagrant." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the AQMD's ride-share rule adopted six years ago, companies in Los 
Angeles, Orange, Riverside and San Bernardino counties with more than 100 
employees must establish programs that encourage employees to car-pool, take 
mass transit or use other means of getting to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Covering 5,200 companies with 1.3 million employees, the groundbreaking rule 
has been one of the AQMD's most ambitious efforts to fight smog. Its goal is to 
increase rush-hour ridership to an average of 1.5 people per car. To comply, 
companies must subsidize train and bus tickets for employees, form van pools 
and offer free parking or other incentives to car-poolers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rule has been unpopular because thousands of offices and other 
non-industrial businesses must spend large amounts of money to create elaborate 
ride-share plans. Collectively, employers in the four-county area spend about 
$160 million a year on the programs, according to one recent study done for the 
AQMD. 
</P>
<P>
 The AQMD's effort to revamp its program will be monitored nationally because 
dozens of other smoggy cities have begun to model ride-sharing regulations on 
Southern California's. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD Board Chairman Henry W. Wedaa, who spearheaded the effort to review the 
regulation, said the new task force will face the challenge of coming up with 
less costly and onerous ways to persuade commuters to leave their cars at home. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the task force will be appointed by the AQMD board. Its size and 
makeup has yet to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 But a number of ideas for revamping the program have surfaced. Among them is 
setting auto registration fees according to the number of miles driven, or 
charging motorists for driving during peak traffic hours. Such efforts, 
however, would require new state laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa stressed that the AQMD cannot abandon or weaken the program because 
state and federal laws require the agency to remove a large number of cars from 
Southland roads by the end of the decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not scaling it back. I am not a supporter of that," said Wedaa, a 
Yorba Linda city councilman. "But I am a supporter of supplying more options to 
obtain the same goals." 
</P>
<P>
 Before voting unanimously for the task force, several board members advocated 
rescinding the ride-share regulation completely. Its strongest critic on the 
board is Los Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich, who called it an 
excessive case of "Big Brother" government imposing its will on private 
businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're regulating the wrong people," agreed Stephen Albright, an AQMD board 
member who was appointed by Gov. Pete Wilson. "We're regulating the employer, 
who has no authority to force the employee (to car-pool)." 
</P>
<P>
 Other board members, however, hailed the regulation as an efficient and 
relatively inexpensive way to reduce smog. 
</P>
<P>
 "What are we going to substitute instead? What is the cost to society . . . if 
we scrap this program entirely?" asked AQMD board member and Los Angeles City 
Councilman Marvin Braude. 
</P>
<P>
 Wedaa said the task force "can't just throw rocks, you have to come up with 
solutions."  
</P>
<P>
 Board member Harriett M. Wieder, an Orange County supervisor, said she did not 
"want the task force to be an excuse for studying it to death and going back to 
business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 Although AQMD staff members acknowledge that the ride-share rule is unwieldy 
and time-consuming for businesses, they say it has been one of the most 
effective methods of reducing smog-causing emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 The average number of riders per car has increased to 1.24 from 1.13 when the 
program was adopted in 1987, according to the AQMD. During that time, the 
agency estimates that 11 million one-way trips per year have been eliminated in 
the four counties. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics among business leaders and government officials have condemned it 
as a costly attempt at social engineering that is bound to fail because so many 
Southland residents depend on their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have found it very difficult to sell alternative modes to our employees 
when the cost of fuel is so low and the available alternatives to the 
drive-alone mode are so few," said Bill Gemmill, a transportation manager at 
Continental Airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Gemmill said Continental spends $300,000 annually on a ride-share program for 
its 4,000 employees in the Los Angeles Basin, and has raised its ridership 
average to 1.3 people per car from 1.05 a few years ago. But it is still short 
of the required 1.5. 
</P>
<P>
 Others on Friday urged the board to leave the ride-share requirements intact. 
The rule "is not a failure. (It) does work," said Bruce Roberts, the city of 
Los Angeles' rideshare program administrator.

4TH ESCAPE SHAKES THE COMMUNITY'S CONFIDENCE; CORRECTIONS: CIVIC LEADERS ON THE 
LANCASTER PRISON'S ADVISORY PANEL BELIEVE THE INCIDENTS EXPOSE FLAWS. THEY WILL 
URGE FULL INVESTIGATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

Stephanie Stassel.

<P>
 Civic leaders who toured the new state prison in Lancaster shortly after it 
opened last February were assured that prisoners could not escape via the 
garbage trucks driving in and out of the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursday, a 25-year-old inmate, serving a life sentence for shooting a 
California Highway Patrol officer, did just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the man was recaptured, members of the prison's community advisory 
committee said Friday that they were upset about the prison's fourth escape in 
less than a year, the second involving a high-security inmate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whenever someone breaks out of prison, there's a hole in the system," 
Lancaster Councilman George Root said. "It sounds like someone wasn't doing 
their job again." 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley College President Allan Kurki, who also serves on the advisory 
panel, said the detention center "was clearly sold here in the community as a 
state-of-the-art prison that would be as escape-proof as possible. . . . This 
is very disturbing to me." 
</P>
<P>
 The prisoner who escaped Thursday, Steven Charles Brigida, originally of 
Thousand Oaks, was injured when the garbage truck compressed him into a bale, 
then dumped him in a landfill. He was recaptured and taken to Antelope Valley 
Hospital Medical Center, where he was being treated Friday for broken ribs, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after prison administrators learned about the escape, they notified 
the 15 members of the advisory panel. The committee meets regularly with Warden 
Otis Thurman to discuss local concerns about the prison -- built despite 
protests by numerous residents. 
</P>
<P>
 James T. Lott, the committee's chairman, said it has become tougher to 
convince residents that the prison, housing about 4,000 inmates, poses no 
danger to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still feel it is a safe prison," said Lott, a school administrator. "But I 
can't convince people it's a safe prison when we keep having these escapes. 
There's a weak link somewhere, and we need to get that repaired." 
</P>
<P>
 Lott said the escape will be addressed at the panel's next meeting Jan. 26. 
"Our committee will request a full investigation," he said. "We'll have many 
questions about policies and procedures. We need to tighten things up an awful 
lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Prison spokesman Kenn I. Hicks said Friday that the staff is still trying to 
find out how Brigida, who worked in the kitchen, was able to hide in a waste 
bin that later was emptied into a garbage truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bins are in a secured area," Hicks said. "Anytime trash is put into these 
bins, that's supervised by an officer. Nobody puts anything in there without 
being supervised." 
</P>
<P>
 Hicks said Thurman was unavailable for comment regarding the escape. 
</P>
<P>
 In Sacramento, Bill Gengler, a spokesman for the California Department of 
Corrections, said that because garbage trucks have been used for prison escapes 
elsewhere, the department uses special security measures around the bins. He 
said he could not explain how the Lancaster escape occurred until the 
investigation is finished. 
</P>
<P>
 About six or seven high-security prisoners escape annually from the 27 state 
prisons in California, Gengler said. Some prisons have reported two 
high-security escapes in one year, as happened in Lancaster, he said. Most, 
however, report no escapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gengler added: "Until we know all the details, we're not going to take any 
action against the administrators of the prison." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities confirmed Friday that Brigida was arrested in October, 1987, after 
two CHP officers spotted him speeding on a stolen motorcycle along the Golden 
State Freeway north of Castaic. 
</P>
<P>
 After a 20-mile chase, Brigida was thrown from his motorcycle when it hit a 
log. When the officers ordered him to stop, he fired a handgun at Officer David 
Zielsch, striking him in the right cheek. Zielsch recovered and returned to 
active duty. 
</P>
<P>
 Brigida fired a second shot that missed the officers before he was wrestled to 
the ground and arrested. 
</P>
<P>
 He pleaded guilty to two counts of attempted first-degree murder in 1988. 
Escapes from Lancaster Since its opening in February, 1993, four inmates have 
escaped from the California State Prison in Lancaster. Here are the incidents: 
</P>
<P>
 July 2: Juan Isidro Maestas, 19, serving a two-year sentence for burglary, and 
Jesse Adame, 20, serving a four-year sentence for robbery, walk away from their 
minimum-security barrack. Adame is arrested two days later in the City of 
Industry after a carjacking. Maestas is arrested four days after the escape in 
El Monte, after prison officials receive information that he might be there. 
</P>
<P>
 Oct. 5: Convicted murderer Eric Rene Johnson, 23, serving a life sentence 
without the possibility of parole, escapes from the maximum-security unit in 
the evening. He is spotted about five hours later at a convenience store 
parking lot at 15th Street West and Avenue K, a few miles from the prison, 
where he was recaptured. He had climbed over an 8-foot block wall and two 
12-foot chain-link fences -- all topped with coiled razor wire -- while two 
guards were distracted. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 13: Steven Charles Brigida, 25, serving a sentence of life plus eight 
years for attempted murder, auto theft and burglary, stows away in a garbage 
truck and is compacted with the trash and dumped into a local landfill. After 
crying out for help, Brigida is turned over to prison guards and Los Angeles 
County sheriff's deputies, who take him to the hospital. He had apparently 
climbed inside a prison garbage bin that was hoisted into the truck and them 
dumped.

175 ANAHEIM POLICE WILL STAGE 1-DAY 'BLUE FLU' SICKOUT TUESDAY; LABOR: OFFICERS 
WANT RAISES AND HAVE BEEN 18 MONTHS WITHOUT A CONTRACT. PUBLIC WILL BE 
PROTECTED BY SUBSTITUTES, POLICE CHIEF SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 About 175 police officers will stage a one-day "blue flu" sickout Tuesday to 
protest their contract situation, forcing the city to patrol its streets with 
department brass and officers from neighboring cities.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to disrupt the day-to-day operation of the department," Bruce 
Bottolfson, president of the Anaheim Police Assn., said Friday. The job action, 
the first in department history, will commence at 6 a.m. Tuesday and end at 6 
a.m. Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 About 175 officers are scheduled to work Tuesday and will call in sick, 
Bottolfson said. About 150 officers have the day off -- Anaheim patrol officers 
work three 12-hour shifts weekly -- and they have agreed not to come to work if 
called. The union contract expired 18 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The salary range for Anaheim police officers is $2,804 to $4,040 a month. That 
ranks 18th among the 20 city police departments in the county, according to 
Bottolfson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a membership meeting that 200 people were at, and no more than five 
people were opposed to the blue flu," Bottolfson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Randall Gaston said residents will see no difference in police 
protection should the sickout occur. Gaston said other cities have agreed to 
lend Anaheim officers; Anaheim's 14 lieutenants will do patrols, and its four 
captains will work as watch commanders or shift supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will continue to provide emergency services," Gaston said. 
</P>
<P>
 Courts say that blue flu sickouts are illegal, ruling that they violate the 
state civil code prohibition on police strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 In other places where there have been blue flu sickouts, courts have been 
quick to grant the cities injunctions forcing the officers back to work within 
the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim officials say they do not know whether they will seek an injunction. 
The city will not pay the officers for a sick day, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will do whatever it takes to protect the public safety," City Atty. Jack 
L. White said. "We will adopt a wait-and-see posture. If the police chief feels 
we need an injunction, we will get one. . . . Anyone who thinks we won't get 
one is betting on the come line." 
</P>
<P>
 The officers have been working without a contract since July, 1992, and have 
not had a raise since 1991. They are now demanding an immediate 4% pay 
increase, a 2% raise in July and a 4% raise next January. Previously, they had 
been asking for a 10% raise in a contract that would have lasted until 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is continuing to offer an immediate 3.25% raise, a 3.25% raise next 
year and has added a raise of 3.5% to 5% in 1996, depending on economic 
factors. In addition, the officers would receive a one-time $750 bonus if the 
offer is accepted. A city official said it is a $2.3-million package and that 
the city cannot afford more. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've really tried to put a fair offer on the table," City Manager James D. 
Ruth said earlier this week when he learned of the impending action. "We're 
disappointed they would do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth was not available for comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bottolfson said officers would only come to work Tuesday if something drastic, 
such as a hostage situation, should occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Community leaders said they are disappointed a sickout has been called, but 
some said they understand the officers' anger. 
</P>
<P>
 Keith Olesen, a downtown community activist, said: "I feel badly that (the 
officers) feel they have to do this. My opinion is that they should be the 
best-paid department and have the best ratio of cops per 1,000 residents in the 
county. But I don't think this (sickout) is the way to get that." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Salgado, a leader of Parents Against Gang Environments, criticized the 
union for threatening the work stoppage and city officials for apparently doing 
nothing to block it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The union is threatening to hold the city hostage," Salgado said. He said 
that no matter who takes the officers' places, those people will not be able to 
do a good job patrolling the city. "They don't know the city, so it will take 
longer for them to respond. (The threatened stoppage) gives the impression that 
the officers don't care about anything except money. . . . They are endangering 
the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Bottolfson said the officers are being forced to take the action because the 
city refuses to budge in contract negotiations. Residents will not be 
endangered by the work stoppage, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would only be holding the city hostage if the work stoppage was longer 
than a day," he said. "Using officers from other cities and the lieutenants for 
one day will not endanger anyone. We would not do anything that would endanger 
the residents."

 Vincent F. Bonacker, 43, was appointed fire chief this week by City Manager 
George Tindall. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonacker has been acting fire chief since Sept. 1, when Lon Cahill retired.He 
joined the department in 1977 as a firefighter / paramedic after starting his 
fire service career three years earlier with the California Division of 
Forestry.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; COUNCIL POSTPONES DECISION ON 2 ITEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN MILLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council marked its first meeting of the new year this week by 
postponing two of the more important items on its agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 4 to 0 Tuesday to continue a long-delayed item about a study 
to contract with the county for firefighting services.Likewise, the council 
moved to reconsider a $1.7-million project to bring aging structures built with 
un-reinforced masonry up to state earthquake codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Gene Beyer, who is still recovering from a broken left arm suffered in 
December, was absent Tuesday afternoon. In a letter to the council, Beyer said 
he will return for the Tuesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 The council has put off a decision regarding a fire services study, which 
would cost $15,000, for more than two months. The council said it would finally 
address the study at its Jan. 18 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of contracting out fire service with the county contend the move 
could save the city as much $1.8 million over two years. However, because of an 
October contract with city firefighters, the city cannot contract with the 
county for another two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The council also said it will revisit the second phase of a two-phase 
rehabilitation program designed to make buildings withstand earthquakes. The 
project will provide financial incentives for about 55 property owners to 
upgrade their buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The first phase, which is almost completed, reviewed building materials and 
engineering for 77 city buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a dozen speakers urged the council to delay a vote on the project, citing 
poor communication with the city staff and concerns about securing proper 
financing.MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; FIRM WILL BID GOODBY TO 4 BISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four North American bison that have grazed around the historic Buffalo Ranch 
complex for six years will be auctioned off next month when the property's main 
tenant leaves. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange Financial Corp., which owns the bison and has called the Buffalo Ranch 
home for more than 20 years, was informed recently that its month-to-month 
lease with the Irvine Co. will be terminated in February. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Co. officials said their decision was based in part on an impending 
street-widening project that will require the relocation of two buildings in 
the sprawling complex. The San Joaquin Hills Transportation Corridor Agency 
plans to widen Ford Road as part of its toll road project. 
</P>
<P>
 William Lange, who heads Lange Financial, has been praised by local 
preservationists for his work over the years in maintaining the ranch's 
historic integrity. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1950s, the site was an amusement park filled with animals, 
including bison. In the 1960s, it was headquarters for William Pereira and 
other architects who planned the city and UC Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange "holds this place close to his heart," said Sheila Starnes, a 
spokeswoman for the real estate marketing company. "He played chess here with 
William Pereira and as a boy stopped here for water when driving his bike to 
the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Lange could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Starnes said that Lange brought bison back to Buffalo Ranch in 1988. "I think 
the decision was attributed to the historical significance of the site," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company will hold a farewell party at the ranch on Feb. 19 and 20. The 
event is open to the public and will include a petting zoo and hot-air ballon 
rides. On Feb. 20, the bison will be auctioned. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information about the "Last Round Up" event, call (714) 640-2388. 
People interested in bidding on the bison may call (714) 644-7003. 
</P>
<P>
 Lange Financial plans to move into a new location in nearby Newport Beach in 
late February.SHELBY GRAD

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: LEAGUE PLANS MEETING ON SCHOOL REFORM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to learn more about the state of education in the Los Angeles 
Unified School District, a League of Women Voters of Los Angeles committee is 
holding a public meeting to understand the myriad reform programs in the school 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, to be held today, will be moderated by Board of Education member 
Julie Korenstein.The panelists include Helen Bernstein, president of United 
Teachers-Los Angeles; Peggy Funkhouser, president of the Los Angeles Education 
Partnership; Yvonne Chan, director of the Vaughn Next Century Learning Center 
-- a school district charter campus; Robert Wycoff, president emeritus of the 
Atlantic Richfield Co. and a founder of the LEARN project; and Ruben Zacarias, 
a school district deputy superintendent, who will discuss the magnet and 
alternative schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The league's education committee is preparing a study on public school 
restructuring so that it can take positions on the various ways the district is 
being reformed, according to Elaine Steiner, a co-chairwoman of the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a one-year study seeking to find criteria for judging restructuring," 
Steiner said. "Our main concern is that whatever is done results in improved 
student achievement." 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which is free and will run from 10 a.m. until 12:30 p.m., will be 
held at the Kaiser Permanente facility, 5601 De Soto Ave. in Building 5, 
Auditorium A, in Woodland Hills. For more information, contact the league 
office at (213) 939-3535. BETH SHUSTER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: ENCINO; ARCHITECT BRAY TO BE CITED FOR ACHIEVEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From the picture window of his airy, eighth-floor studio in Encino, William 
Bray can look down on hundreds of homes he has designed. And they're just the 
tip of the iceberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Designs created by William Bray, AIA Architect & Associates have been used to 
build more than 40,000 housing units throughout California. Bray himself has 
been designing homes and commercial buildings for more than 60 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the San Fernando Valley chapter of the American Institute of Architects 
will honor Bray's accomplishments by presenting him with its first Lifetime 
Achievement Award. 
</P>
<P>
 The 7 p.m. event at Mountaingate Country Club in Brentwood could easily be 
billed as "William Bray: An Architect and a Gentleman." 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a wonderful father, and a wonderful example of what an architect should 
be," said Roger Winston Bray, 40, who joined his father's firm in 1974. "He has 
never had an unkind word to say about anyone. And his talent matches his 
kindness." 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes me feel glad I'm an architect with him," said Roger Bown, president 
of the Valley AIA chapter. 
</P>
<P>
 Bray's design style tends toward the traditional. He can claim to his credit 
many English-style country estates, American Colonial mansions and Spanish 
villas. The architect's homes can be found in Southern California's most 
exclusive neighborhoods, including Brentwood, Bel-Air and Westlake Village. 
Bray has also designed custom homes for clients in Hawaii, Florida, Thailand 
and the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't go way out on a limb," Bray said. "We work with the needs of the 
clients." 
</P>
<P>
 The veteran designer graduated from UC Berkeley in 1928. An art major, he once 
dreamed of going to Paris to become a painter. But an awareness of the 
instability of a painter's life and of the "great need" for architectural 
design put him on his present course. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love being able to express both beauty and utility," Bray said. KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 2ND PARENT-CHILD CENTER WILL OPEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIO MORAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Volunteers of America of Los Angeles, which operates a skill development 
program for parents and their children in Harbor City, will open a similar 
center in North Hollywood next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Raymond Hernandez, the agency's program director for children services, said 
that the Parent-Child Center -- which will be only the second such facility in 
Los Angeles County -- will be housed at its Maud Booth Family Center at 11243 
Kittridge St. Currently, VOA operates a child-care center there. 
</P>
<P>
 The Parent-Child Center is a component of the federally funded Head Start 
program, which provides meals, instruction and health services to poor 
children. The parent-child program is designed to teach parents how to interact 
with their children, from birth to age 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez said 95 families will be served. Applications are now being accepted 
for the program. Applicants must meet federal guidelines similar to those for 
Head Start and must live within five miles of the center. JULIO MORAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WINNETKA; PTA COLLECTS $800 FOR VICTIMS OF FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twelve-year-old Mathew Bell hasn't been back to school since a fire swept 
through his family's apartment, destroying most of their belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no where to live now. We're homeless," he said with a voice older 
than his age. "My parents said we might have to sleep in our car, and if we do, 
I won't be able to go to school until we find someplace else to live." 
</P>
<P>
 Bell and at least 15 of his schoolmates from Winnetka Elementary School have 
been left homeless or displaced by the fire Wednesday that damaged the 
apartment house at 19916 Roscoe Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 In a bid to help, the school's Parent-Teacher Assn. has collected more than 
$800 for the families as well as clothes, food and toys. 
</P>
<P>
 Elizabeth Franklin, whose two daughters attend the school, decided to ask 
local stores for donations for the fire victims. "I just thought, 'People need 
help tonight.' So I went home and made the calls," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 Along with the donations of clothes and food from school families, Franklin 
got Lucky's to donate $300 and Target to give $500. Teachers and staff 
collected $71 for the victims. But the most cherished donation came from a 
kindergarten student who emptied her piggy bank and gave $2 in change, Franklin 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Examining the stuffed animals and small figurines on a table in the school's 
auditorium, Karina Mejia-Camaro, 8, said she will be back at school Tuesday for 
the first time since the fire. "I miss my teacher," said the shy third-grader, 
as she clutched a stuffed dolphin. "And my friend, Heidi." 
</P>
<P>
 Karina's home was spared and her family has moved back in, but utilities have 
been shut off, leaving them no place to shower or cook food. 
</P>
<P>
 During the fire, Karina worried most about the doll she just received for 
Christmas. "Santa Claus just brought it to me and I wanted to take her with 
me," she said. "But I had to leave her and her clothes behind." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathew said his family saved pets, a few chairs and a Super Nintendo video 
game he received for Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish it never happened," he said. "I wish we had a home still."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; DOWNTOWN TO ADOPT OLD WEST THEME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Calabasas officials have approved plans to promote the town's gunslinger past 
by adorning its two-block historic core with old-fashioned signs, street 
lights, wooden sidewalks and planters. 
</P>
<P>
 At a joint meeting Wednesday night, the Calabasas City Council and Planning 
Commission agreed to move forward with the project, which will cost an 
estimated $900,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, to be financed through the sale of certificates of participation, 
was proposed as a way to transform the area near the historic Leonis Adobe into 
an Old West-style shopping and dining center. 
</P>
<P>
 The project will include the construction of a landscaped street median, 
sidewalks, planters, wooden benches, street lights and signs. Merchants in the 
area will have new guidelines for their signs, Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying for less glass and chrome and more of the Old West," Calabasas 
Planning Director Steve Harris said. "We want to attract more people down there 
to stay and visit the specialty stores and walk around." 
</P>
<P>
 The stretch of Calabasas Road between Park Granada Boulevard and Mulholland 
Drive -- an area that during the late 1800s lured travelers to its saloons and 
dance halls -- already is home to the Sagebrush Cantina, a popular hangout. 
</P>
<P>
 With the planned improvements, Harris said, the street motif will tie in with 
the Western atmosphere created by the cantina and the Leonis Adobe museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Separate plans for a parking structure on the south side of Calabasas Road 
have stalled, however, because the would-be construction site is within the 
city of Los Angeles, creating problems with jurisdiction. 
</P>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles is considering a request from Calabasas officials to 
annex the land, which includes the Sagebrush Cantina and the Leonis Adobe. KURT

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; MATCHING FUNDS IN DOUBT FOR BIKE PATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT GLOVER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Calabasas may come up short in its effort to drum up regional 
support for a bike path that would parallel the Ventura Freeway from Thousand 
Oaks to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In order to receive a $305,900 grant from the Metropolitan Transportation 
Authority to pay for the planning of the project, Calabasas must provide 
$85,000 in matching local funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Planners say the path would benefit all cities in the region by increasing 
safety for cyclists and encouraging both recreational and commuter cycling 
along the route. 
</P>
<P>
 But while the city and county of Los Angeles have agreed to chip in a combined 
$30,000 over two years to help pay for the path's design, the city of Agoura 
Hills has declined to take part in the project, and Westlake Village may not 
either. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project has some merit," said Raymond Taylor, the city manager of 
Westlake Village. "But the city already has a bike path, so we wouldn't get a 
lot of benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the council's decision to table the matter last week was an indication 
that there is not a lot of support for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Project coordinator Mark Wessel, who also serves as traffic engineer for 
Calabasas, said it is up to the City Council to decide whether to move forward 
with plans for the bike path without additional financial support. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just have to evaluate where we stand now," Wessel said. "We have to 
consider whether downsizing is an option . . . whether funding may be available 
elsewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 The money will pay for a topographic survey, traffic analysis, environmental 
documentation and plans for the path. Funding for construction is not yet 
available. SCOTT GLOVER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; $280,000 GRANTED FOR ONGOING FIRE RELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Labor last week granted $280,000 to Orange County to 
use for ongoing relief efforts stemming from last year's fire that destroyed 
hundreds of homes in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The $280,000 is part of a $1.2-million federal grant to give temporary work to 
people who lost their jobs as a result of the fires in Orange, Los Angeles, San 
Diego, and Ventura counties, according to a statement from the office of Rep. 
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach), whose district includes Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The grant will be used to hire about 40 workers to participate in ongoing 
cleanup operations in Laguna Beach, said Margo West, manager of planning at the 
Orange County Private Industry Council, which will allocate the money in Orange 
County. The grant allows each person hired to work a maximum of six months and 
earn up to $6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is to help individuals potentially displaced by the fire and the 
long-term unemployed," West said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 1, West said, her organization will contact Laguna Beach officials and 
begin the search for people who lost homes in which they lived and worked. BOB

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; DRIVE-BY SHOOTING SUSPECT IS ARRESTED 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An alleged gang member from Orange has been arrested in connection with a 
drive-by shooting that occurred on the San Diego Freeway last November, police 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jacob Morante, 21, is accused of pulling alongside an unidentified 24-year-old 
Huntington Beach man on the southbound lanes of the freeway near Harbor 
Boulevard, exchanging glances with the motorist, then firing a shot, said 
police spokesman George Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, who was not injured, heard the shot, looked over and saw the 
driver of the other car holding a small handgun, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He pulled over to inspect his car and found one bullet hole in the passenger 
door a couple of inches below the window," Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was able to get a description of the suspect's car and a license 
plate number, which eventually led Costa Mesa police to Morante, who was 
arrested at his home late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives searched Morante's home and found a loaded sawed-off shotgun and a 
small-caliber semiautomatic handgun, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morante is being held at Costa Mesa city jail on suspicion of assault with a 
deadly weapon, unlawful discharge of a weapon and possession of a dangerous 
weapon. His bail has been set at $25,000. GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; LACK OF BLACK UNITY CITED BY PANEL AT UCI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's a lack of community among Orange County's African Americans and 
something should be done about it, a small group of students and faculty told a 
UC Irvine panel convened in honor of Martin Luther King Jr. this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the problem, one panelist said, is that blacks in Orange County are 
few and far between. 
</P>
<P>
 "How do you fire up the community to come together?" Mike Allen asked four 
African American community leaders who participated in a campus forum Thursday 
night. "We want concrete solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Allen was one of about 15 students and staff who attended the forum on 
contemporary issues facing blacks in Orange County. The discussion was part of 
UCI's three-day symposium on King, the slain civil rights leader. 
</P>
<P>
 The panelists -- Randall Jordan, publisher of the Black Orange; Milton Grimes, 
attorney for Rodney King; Judy Sampson, Santa Ana high school teacher; and 
James Cones, a UCI psychologist -- faced spirited questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't even care enough about ourselves to come here," said sophomore 
Taengye Watson, who was upset about sparse attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 "Critical mass is important in one's environment," Cones said. "To walk down 
the street . . . and see people who look like you creates a sense of community. 
African Americans' visibility is low" in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimes stressed the role of government. Referring to his client, Rodney King, 
and the city of Los Angeles' reluctance to give King the monetary settlement 
he's been seeking, Grimes said African Americans must constantly question the 
justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan quoted three public defenders who he said recently stated on TV that 
"the purpose of the system is to incarcerate young black males." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "That to me is a conspiracy," said Jordan, one of those seeking an independent 
probe of the fatal shooting of Sheriff's Deputy Darryn Leroy Robins by a fellow 
officer during an impromptu training session behind a Mission Viejo theater 
complex earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The lack of community is related to a "me, me" attitude, Sampson said. "When I 
was (a UCI student), there might have been only 200 African American students 
at UCI. But 195 of them would be here" attending the forum. 
</P>
<P>
 When confronted with the students' demands for stronger leadership, like that 
provided by Martin Luther King Jr., Jordan said the generation of black youths 
who grew up in the 1960s "lost it" after the deaths of Malcolm X and King. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today we are trying to experience leadership," Jordan said. "We can't tell 
you the answers. . . . We don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Grimes: "You are the warriors. You have the energy. We have the 
experience." 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't feel like the problems are too big to surmount, " freshman Ethan 
Walters said. "We can't give up." 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said the first step should be to "go to all our friends tomorrow and 
ask them, where were they?"

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; HE DRAWS ON TALENT AS SOURCE OF INCOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA

<TEXT>
<P>
 Like most boys, Rafael Maniago loved playing cowboys and Indians. But not with 
toy guns or bows and arrows. He played on paper. He would spend hours drawing 
mock battles and portraits of Indian chiefs. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 40 years later, thousands of miles away from his native Philippines, 
Maniago still loves to draw cowboys and Indians. But this time it is to support 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Western art is becoming popular among collectors, Maniago said, and his work 
is helping send two children to college. "I'm making a living," said Maniago, 
50, who also teaches art classes at the Pasadena Art Center and holds private 
lessons to supplement his income. "You can say, I'm not your typical struggling 
artist." 
</P>
<P>
 Maniago is a member of the Los Alamitos Community Art League, an organization 
of about 200 artists from around Southern California that regularly holds 
shows, exhibits and painting demonstrations at the community center here. Last 
year, two of his pen-and-ink drawings were featured in "A History of Early Los 
Alamitos," a book published by the Los Alamitos Museum Assn. that chronicles 
life in the city in the early 1800s. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city has helped me expose my work," said Maniago, who offered his 
services for free for the book that the museum hopes to sell to local 
parent-teacher groups. The book costs $5. "I wanted to give something back," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, Maniago signed copies of the book for residents Sydney 
Gordon, Earl Kendrick and Althea Miller at the Los Alamitos Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are very few cities like Los Alamitos," said Miller, a member of the 
city's Cultural and Fine Arts Commission. "The book will show the children what 
we have here and hopefully, they can appreciate that." 
</P>
<P>
 Using old photographs, Maniago and four other artists drew some of the city's 
historic structures. The Filipino's drawings showed his versatility, according 
to Buddy Hawkins, former president of the Los Alamitos Community Art League, 
who considers Maniago one of the art group's best portrait artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "He makes a living off his paintings, which is unusual for an artist 
nowadays," said Hawkins, who has been painting for the past 20 years as a 
hobby. "He wins almost every art competition that he enters. He's very 
talented." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Angeles City, Pampanga, on the island of Luzon, Maniago attended the 
University of the East in Manila, where he studied fine arts and advertising. 
He owned and managed his art gallery near Clark Air Base from 1965 to 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 When he came to the United States in 1985, he painted advertising signs to 
make a living for two years. He also took art lessons to improve his skills. In 
1990, he studied under Chuck Hammond, a portrait instructor, who later 
introduced him to the art group. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very hard-working and wants to learn all the time," said Hammond. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniago has won awards in various art competitions. In 1990, he was named 
Artist of the Year at the San Gabriel Fine Art Show. One of his paintings hangs 
at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniago said he hopes to work more on subjects that deal with his Filipino 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my identity, and I want to keep that," he said. "Cowboys and Indians 
(paintings) are fun and help pay the bills, but they don't say who I am." BERT

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; SHY PARENT TURNS INTO SCHOOL LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BYRNES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten years ago, the inside of a school was a place Isabel Martinez rarely 
ventured. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though she had five children under 10, the Pacoima resident said she knew 
little about how they were doing in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very shy," Martinez said. "I was one of those parents who dropped off 
my children and picked them up. I never found out who the teachers were or what 
the principal's name was." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez isn't shy anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 As community representative at the Telfair Avenue Elementary School parent 
center, Martinez is now a charismatic leader and role model for hundreds of 
parents in the Pacoima community where she lives. 
</P>
<P>
 She says an incident a decade ago led to her about-face. 
</P>
<P>
 One sweltering afternoon, Martinez said, she waited outside Pacoima Elementary 
School for her fourth-grade son to be dismissed from class. After a half an 
hour, she entered the school's main office to find him, and to her dismay, 
realized that she knew neither his room number nor his teacher's name. 
</P>
<P>
 "It hit me," she said. "What if there was an emergency or something happened? 
I wouldn't know where to go or what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 After learning that her son was being held for detention in a misunderstanding 
with the teacher, Martinez vowed to get involved with her children's education. 
</P>
<P>
 At first a volunteer classroom assistant, Martinez was hired by the district 
in 1990 to head the San Fernando Valley's first federally funded parent center, 
headquartered in a spare classroom at Telfair school. Since then, more than two 
dozen other Valley schools have opened parent centers, and many look to Telfair 
as a model. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents can take classes at the center, which also serves as a base from which 
parents can volunteer to help in their students' classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 With eight children of her own and an intimate familiarity with the concerns 
of the people she serves, many look to Martinez as a model too.  
</P>
<P>
 Adela Moreno, who moved to Pacoima from Mexico five years ago, said she was 
afraid to speak in front of other people before meeting Martinez at the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I woke up from a long sleep," Moreno said through a translator at 
a recent parenting seminar. Moreno, who has three children, said Martinez 
inspired her to take English and literacy classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was born in Los Angeles, but moved to Mexico for about seven years to 
live with her grandmother when her mother was unable to care for her. Back in 
the United States, Martinez graduated from Belmont High School in Los Angeles 
and married when she was 19, after her mother convinced her that education was 
not a suitable pursuit for a young woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 41, with her youngest child almost 4 years old, Martinez is making plans 
to return to school. 
</P>
<P>
 She inspired Telfair parent Celia Torres to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "She showed us that we can help ourselves and our children," said Torres, a 
mother of three, "that we are not dependent on anyone." SUSAN BYRNES

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; CITY OFFERS $100,000 LOAN TO BOOST JOBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trying to revitalize the city's Golden State Redevelopment area -- hit hard in 
the past few years by the pullout of Lockheed Corp. -- the city of Burbank has 
offered a $100,000 interest-free loan to a property owner in the hopes of 
keeping a longtime business in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we have an opportunity here to provide a little bit of stimulation in 
an area that needs stimulation," Mayor George Battey Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the arrangement -- approved by the City Council in a 4-1 vote on Tuesday -- 
the city will loan $100,000 to the Antonini Family Trust, owners of property at 
3010 N. San Fernando Road. The site is the potential home for Ryan Herco 
Products Corp., an industrial supply company that has been considering moving 
for about a year. 
</P>
<P>
 A condition for the loan is that the property be leased to Ryan Herco for 10 
years. In each year of the 10-year lease, the city would forgive 10% of the 
loan as long as Ryan Herco employs 50 people in its first five years and 60 
people in the second 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't finalized the lease yet," said Frank Gibbs, president of Ryan 
Herco Products Corp., on Friday, adding that other sites could still be 
considered. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Susan Spanos voted against the loan, saying she wanted more 
information on the lease arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 The money would be used to pay for part of the $400,000 in renovations needed 
for a 36,000-square-foot warehouse building. Keeping Ryan Herco, which has been 
in Burbank for 45 years but has been looking at sites throughout the Los 
Angeles area and around the country, would mean $53,000 a year in tax revenue 
for the city, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has been struggling to keep employers in Burbank, especially in the 
Golden State Redevelopment Area, which lost Lockheed Corp. and about 15,000 
jobs almost four years ago. The loss of businesses has been dramatic, said 
Battey, who with other officials have visited companies in attempts to keep 
them here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary to drive by a parking lot which a few years ago was full and now 
is almost empty," Battey said. "It's scary to go through a building which is 
almost empty. That area needs some help." ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; DEMOLITION OF MALL BUILDING CONSIDERED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT GLOVER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owner of a Sherman Oaks shopping mall is considering demolishing the 
building that formerly housed an I. Magnin department store and replacing it 
with a larger, 175,000-square-foot store, a spokesman for the owner said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 David Sauers, executive vice president for City Freeholds Inc., which owns 
Fashion Square Mall, said the expansion is one alternative being considered for 
the vacant store. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in the very early conceptual stage at this point," Sauers said. "But 
expanding is one thing we are looking at." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the company's primary interest is finding a tenant for the 
55,000-square-foot store, left vacant last year when I. Magnin closed its doors 
as part of companywide consolidation. 
</P>
<P>
 Sauers said if the company decided to expand the mall on Riverside Boulevard 
near Woodman Avenue, plans would also call for a 450-vehicle parking lot to be 
built in the southwest corner of the mall's property. 
</P>
<P>
 Local homeowners, who have met with company officials on possible expansion 
plans, are concerned that adding a large department store to the mall would 
increase traffic congestion in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anytime you look at adding a large anchor tenant to a mall that is something 
you have to think about," said Richard Close, president of the Sherman Oaks 
Homeowners Assn. "We'll be watching their plans carefully." SCOTT GLOVER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; SIGNAL INSTALLED AT SITE OF GIRL'S DEATH 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A new traffic signal will be activated on Tuesday at a Van Nuys intersection 
where a 3-year-old girl was killed and her mother injured after being hit by a 
van last year, a spokesman for City Councilman Joel Wachs said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The four-way traffic signal at Saticoy Street and Densmore Avenue is being 
installed to prevent further accidents involving children, particularly those 
attending nearby Cohasset Street Elementary School, said Wachs spokesman Mark 
Freed. 
</P>
<P>
 The intersection currently has a two-way stop sign that controls traffic on 
Densmore Avenue but not on Saticoy Street, Freed said. The new signal was being 
considered before the child was killed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, Deborah Rojas of Van Nuys was crossing Saticoy Street with her 
mother, Veronica Rojas, when they were struck by a van turning onto Saticoy 
from Densmore Avenue. The child died of injuries she suffered in the accident. 
The mother was treated for cuts and bruises. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the van was not cited for the accident. HUGO MARTIN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; HOUR RESTRICTIONS CONTINUED AT STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAY HWANGBO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 7-Eleven store in Van Nuys must continue to abide by restrictions limiting 
its hours of operation and mandating a security guard every night, a Los 
Angeles zoning official decided Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling on the store at 15317 Vanowen St. was a victory for a group of 
nearby residents who said the shorter hours and guard had reduced crime in the 
drug- and prostitute-infested area. But others lamented the lack of a 
convenient place to get a sandwich and sundries early in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for me," said Dr. Karen Feldman, whose dental office is near the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hearing, intended to review restrictions imposed 20 months ago, 
Associate Zoning Administrator James J. Crisp could have imposed tougher 
restrictions or allowed the request of franchise owner Abdul Ghulamhussain and 
Southland Corp., which owns 7-Eleven, to keep the store open 24 hours a day and 
post a guard on weekend nights only. Crisp did neither. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has been an attempt to try to work in the community," Crisp said. "I'm 
impressed with the fact that there have been no (Alcoholic Beverage Control) 
violations and no arrests on the site" in the ensuing time period, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Crisp said zoning officials throughout the city are denying business 
requests to be open for 24 hours, due to the "changing social environment" and 
the crime that such businesses seem to attract. 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Archer, a zoning consultant for the Southland Corp., said he was 
disappointed by the decision, which 7-Eleven may appeal to the Board of Zoning 
Appeals. He said a decision will be made within the next week. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1992, the board called the convenience store a public nuisance that 
fostered prostitution and drug sales, and ordered it to cut back its 24-hour 
schedule to 6 a.m. to 1 a.m. on weekdays and Saturdays and until midnight on 
Sundays. Since then, Ghulamhussain has worked with local Neighborhood Watch and 
Business Watch leaders in an effort to reduce crime near his store. Several 
residents said the businesses that share a parking lot with the 7-Eleven are 
allowing crime to flourish.  
</P>
<P>
 Don Schultz, a community leader who supported continuation of the 
restrictions, said he and Flip Smith, co-chairman of the Sepulveda Boulevard 
Business Watch, plan to ask property owners of those businesses to do something 
about the problem. KAY HWANGBO

 Cora Pursel thought she'd have to scramble to find open classes at Glendale 
Community College on Friday, the last day of registration before next week's 
start of the spring 1994 semester. 
</P>
<P>
 But to her surprise, Pursel, 23, was able to pick out her English, sociology 
and dance courses in 10 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought there would be more students, (Glendale) being a smaller 
community," said Pursel, a former San Diego resident who watched a list of 
course offerings flash through a computer monitor. "I thought it would be a lot 
more difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't been more difficult, largely because of the decline in student 
enrollment at the college this year compared with the previous spring semester, 
college officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Friday, 12,235 part- and full-time students were enrolled at the college 
-- down 565 from the same period last spring, said Registrar Peggy Brown. 
Classes for the spring semester begin Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a surge," Brown said. Registration lines have been "just steady 
today." 
</P>
<P>
 College officials said late registration figures could help push the 
enrollment number closer to that of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Gary Parker, dean of admissions and records, said the dip in registration 
reflects the enrollment slide facing most of the state's public universities 
and community colleges. A Chronicle of Higher Education study showed that from 
fall 1992 to fall 1993, the community college system suffered a drop of 137,000 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker said students are staying away from the Glendale college due to either 
higher tuition costs, which jumped last fall from $10 per unit to $13, or the 
early spring semester start this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're starting two weeks earlier than a year ago, which makes a difference," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the enrollment drop, Parker said the college will not lose money from 
the state. Funding for attendance at the college level is based on the number 
of student class hours taught, and the attendance drop this year will not be 
severe enough to reduce the level of funding, Parker said. TOMMY LI

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LA HABRA; KING HUSSEIN GRANTS BOY'S WISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Andrew Hijazin wrote a letter to King Hussein of Jordan in October much the 
way many children write to famous people everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8-year-old boy's request: four airline tickets to Amman, Jordan, so that 
he, his parents and his 5-year-old brother, Michael, could visit his 
grandmother and the country she lives in. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your Majesty, I would love to visit my home country, Jordan, and see my 
grandmother and see you," Andrew wrote. "My dad can't afford the tickets. . . . 
Please help me and send me four tickets." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew never once doubted that Hussein would fulfill his wish. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten days later, his parents were shocked to receive a letter from the Royal 
Hashemite Court asking Andrew for the names of his relatives in order to send 
the airline tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew that the king would write to me and take us to Jordan," said Andrew, a 
third-grader at Las Positas Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The family returned from the Middle East this week after spending a month 
visiting with Andrew's grandmother, Jameleh Hijazin, and touring the Arab 
kingdom. They did not get to meet Hussein because he was too busy with peace 
treaty negotiations, the family said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the King's staff treated the family to entertainment, feasts, stays in 
luxurious hotels and chauffeured sightseeing in a Mercedes-Benz. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew's mother, Najat Hijazin, said she still can't believe Hussein's 
generosity. "It was a fairy tale about a little kid's wish that came true," she 
said. "And I almost didn't mail Andrew's letter." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew said he was inspired to write the letter one night as he watching 
Hussein on television and thinking it would be nice to see his paternal 
grandmother. Andrew had met her when he was 2 years old but did not remember 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden, he pulled out his pencil and started writing," Hijazin said. 
"I thought, 'Oh, yeah, right, like the king is going to answer you.' I thought 
it was hilarious." 
</P>
<P>
 When the reply arrived, she said, she was so astonished, she cried. "I 
thought, 'This is a miracle,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 While in Amman, Andrew delivered a ceramic paperweight he made for the king 
and decorated with the Jordanian and U.S. flags. And there was one more letter 
for the king, thanking him for the trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best part was seeing my grandma, who is pretty old and a little bit sick, 
and meeting all my cousins," Andrew said. "I want to go back again." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very fun," said Andrew, naming the cities he visited -- Petra, Aqaba, 
Al Karak, Jerash and several others. 
</P>
<P>
 "We went everywhere, and I learned about (cultural) dances and the history of 
all the towns." MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; PANEL OKS FEE HIKE FOR CITY GOLF COURSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLSON CUMMER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Community Services Commission this week approved an increase in fees at 
the city golf course, which is managed by American Golf Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council will consider the rate increase Feb. 18, said commission 
secretary Betty Schwarzkopf. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, an 18-hole game on the weekend would cost $21, up from 
$18. A full game during the week would cost $16 instead of $14. And there would 
be a $1 reservation fee for 18-hole games on weekends and holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The last rate increase was in 1991. City staff said they believe that the new 
rate increase will not deter people from playing the course. 
</P>
<P>
 Jan Hobson, community service superintendent, said neighboring courses charge 
similar fees. The Imperial Golf Course in Brea and the H.G. Dad Miller course 
in Anaheim charge $22 for an 18-hole game during the weekend, while the La 
Mirada Golf Course charges $21, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 American Golf Corp. staff, in asking for the rate increase, noted that the 
company spent $149,500 to upgrade the course in 1993, and plans to spend 
another $40,000 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reported spending $55,000 last year to put in 7,200 feet of 
concrete for golf cart paths. The paths kept the front nine holes open during 
some flooding that would have previously forced the course to close. 
</P>
<P>
 It also spent $60,000 to build a new bridge for the third hole, in addition to 
planting 125 new trees, seeding the fairways and installing some new sod. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 85,000 rounds of golf were played on the course last year, according 
to American Golf Corp. WILLSON CUMMER

ARIZ. MAN WAIVES RIGHT TO HEARING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Tucson man accused of killing two women in Arizona waived his right Friday 
to an extradition hearing in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Joseph Moody, 34, was arrested Jan. 5 after he walked up to a reception 
desk at the Orange County Sheriff's Department saying he was suffering from 
amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
 A fingerprint search identified him as a Tucson resident suspected of killing 
two women in November. Moody was featured on the "America's Most Wanted" 
television show in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Moody, who is being held without bail, appeared Friday in Santa Ana Municipal 
Court. His decision to waive his right to a formal extradition hearing is 
expected to speed his return to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Robert Knox, who is representing Moody, said Moody 
"just wants to get back to Arizona as soon as possible." He added that his 
client still says he has amnesia. 
</P>
<P>
 The first killing occurred Nov. 15 when an acquaintance of Moody, Michelle 
Page Malone, 33, was found shot to death in her Tucson home. 
</P>
<P>
 The second victim, Patricia Magda, 56, a neighbor of Moody, was found beaten 
to death in her Tucson home about a week later.

CHLORINE GAS LEAK AT SCHOOL POOL SENDS FOUR SWIMMERS TO HOSPITAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO ROMERO and KEVIN JOHNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 3:30 p.m. Friday, the swimming pool alarm at Villa Park High School went 
off and coach Mike Giles, who had 18 of his students ready for swimming 
practice, sensed the danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Four of the students were already in the open-air pool, but there was no 
visible sign that anything was wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 However, "there was a strong smell of chlorine, so I evacuated the pool," 
Giles would say hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleventh-grader Karen Hollinger, 16, one of the swimmers, was playing 
volleyball at the time in a sandy area next to the pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no idea what was going on," she said. "One of my friends came out of 
the pool saying something was wrong. We started laughing, but when she started 
coughing and crying, we knew something was wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 A plume of chlorine fumes could be seen seeping out of the utility room where 
the pool's three chlorine cylinders are kept. Firefighters said the plug in one 
of them, a reserve tank, had melted down, releasing a toxic cloud that Giles 
said was about 10 feet wide and 2 feet high. 
</P>
<P>
 The four girls in the pool were overcome by the gas. They could hardly 
breathe, they told their friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollinger ran to the counseling office for help. Coach Giles, meanwhile, 
stayed behind at a shed near the utility room summoning paramedics and school 
authorities by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The four girls, Sarah Frawley, Jennifer Dwinger, Rebekah Tenapel and Erin 
Schlotterbeck, were hospitalized. None of them, however, was in serious 
condition and at least two were released Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Capt. Stephen Miller, part of the Orange County Hazardous Materials 
Response Team sent to the school, said the plug in a 150-pound cylinder of 
chlorine deteriorated and finally melted, allowing the chloride gas to escape. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety plug is actually meant to melt over the aperture, thus slowing down 
any leakage, but this time, said Fire Department spokeswoman Emmy Day, the plug 
just popped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Frawley, 16, was released at 6:15 p.m. from Chapman General Hospital. "I feel 
fine," she said. "My legs and my arms are trembling a little bit, but I'm OK."

IRVINE MARCHERS RECALL CIVIL RIGHTS LEADER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some students walked with lavender and white balloons tied on their backpacks. 
One mother rolled her baby along in a stroller. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 high school and college students and community members marched from 
William R. Mason Regional Park to UC Irvine Friday in honor of Martin Luther 
King Jr.'s birthday, chanting and waving placards. 
</P>
<P>
 "There aren't as many (UCI students) . . . but (the march) lives on," said 
Druemeka Irving, a UCI senior and president of the African American Student 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 But the crowd was large enough to create a lively atmosphere as participants 
marched down the sidewalks, changing the chant at every stoplight. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria Cortelli, a teacher at Irvine Unified School District's S.E.L.F. 
Alternative school, said events like the march should be part of "an ongoing 
project." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the responsibility of parents and teachers to instill anti-racism in the 
youth of America," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Carrasco, 16, one of the 10 S.E.L.F. students participating in the march, 
said she used to attend a high school where racially motivated fights happened 
all the time. "I came here today because I felt like I was a part of 
something," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to have these high school students here -- it means they have an 
understanding of the legacy," said UCI Vice Chancellor of Student Affairs 
Horace Mitchell. "They are the future leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 The march started off at 11 a.m. with a moment of silence "for those who have 
marched before and those who will march after," said Adisa Ajamu, a professor 
of black studies at San Francisco State. A former Irvine resident, he had flown 
to Orange County to participate in the march. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is more than a march," he told the group, "it is (part of) an effort to 
find and defend our own reality. It is a statement, an affirmation of that." 
</P>
<P>
 As the marchers headed up Harvard Avenue to the campus, Peter Bawler, a 
staffer at the student activities office, said the event "demonstrates our 
principles to the community. . . . It's an expression of the greatness of 
Martin Luther King and what he truly stands for -- achieving an integrated 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 The march ended at the campus square, in front of a stage with loudspeakers 
blaring songs by musician Stevie Wonder. Several faculty members, 
administrators and student leaders spoke in honor of King, and excerpts from 
his speeches "The Drum Major's Instinct" and "I Have a Dream" were played at 
intervals. 
</P>
<P>
 Associate Dean of Students Robert F. Gentry, Laguna Beach's first openly gay 
mayor, told the crowd: "All oppression is oppression is oppression. . . . Your 
struggle is my struggle and my struggle is yours. I'm proud to be here today 
with my brothers and sisters of color."

FUMES CHASE HUNDREDS OF YOUNGSTERS FROM SCHOOL; EMERGENCIES: OFFICIALS SUSPECT 
A LUBRICANT THAT WORKERS SPRAYED INTO THE AIR-CONDITIONING SYSTEM CAUSED THE 
PROBLEM.

 Crying, coughing and holding their aching heads, hundreds of children were 
evacuated from 13 classrooms at Liggett Street Elementary School on Friday 
morning after mysterious, foul-smelling fumes apparently invaded the school's 
ventilation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators from the Los Angeles Unified School District, city Fire 
Department and county hazardous materials unit were called to the school about 
10:55 a.m. but found nothing unusual, school administrator Carmen Schroeder 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schroeder said school officials believe the fumes may have spread from a 
lubricant that maintenance workers sprayed into the school's air-conditioning 
system. Two six-room clusters of classrooms, and another room downwind, were 
affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-grade teacher Rita Faretta, who complained of nausea, was taken to Holy 
Cross Medical Center in Mission Hills, where she was treated and released, 
school officials and a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics calmed and treated about three dozen first- through fourth-grade 
students on the school's playground while anxious parents leaned against 
emergency barricades for more than an hour before their children were released 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents "were ready to rumble," said Joy McKizzie, whose daughter, Jamila, 
is a third-grader at the school. The parents thought the police activity came 
from "a shooting or some type of an abduction situation," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 McKizzie said she saw dozens of frightened children when she arrived at the 
school near her home.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of them appeared to be lethargic," she said, describing the scene. 
"Their eyes were red. They were coughing and crying. . . . A lot of kids were 
crying and holding their heads. Some children were more affected than others. A 
pregnant teacher was nauseous and vomiting. She was very sick."  
</P>
<P>
 McKizzie said her 8-year-old daughter, who is asthmatic, complained of 
shortness of breath, a scratchy throat and was coughing. "She was crying and 
scared," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the children who complained of symptoms were sent home, Principal 
David J. Sanchez said. School officials notified parents by letter.

RACES EMERGE FOR APRIL 12 ELECTION; POLITICS: AN ELEVENTH-HOUR ENTRANT MAKES 
THE CALABASAS CITY COUNCIL CONTEST A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING. 
</P>

 A last-minute challenger saved the Calabasas City Council election from 
futility, while broader fields emerged for April 12 city council and mayoral 
contests in Hidden Hills, San Fernando, Santa Clarita, Lancaster and Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas City Council incumbents Bob Hill, 57, and Dennis Washburn, 51, 
appeared ready to vie uncontested for their at-large seats until certified 
public accountant Ted Rosenquist, 47, filed nominating papers 16 minutes before 
the 5 p.m. deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 Hidden Hills residents will choose among five candidates for three at-large 
seats. They are: incumbents David Stanley, 42; Howard Klein, 50, and James 
Cohen, 55; along with businessmen Monty Fisher, 55, and Stuart Siegel, 48. 
</P>
<P>
 An eight-way race emerged for three at-large seats in the city of San 
Fernando, where three incumbents face five newcomers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-term incumbent Mayor Dan Acuna, a 53-year-old realtor, joins one-term 
incumbent Councilmen Jose Hernandez, 63, an urban studies professor at Cal 
State Northridge who was first elected in 1990, and Doude Wysbeek, a 
54-year-old electrical shop owner elected in 1982 and then again in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 They face challengers Arthur Kay, a 53-year-old workers' compensation 
attorney; John Becker, 41, a service representative for the Automobile Club of 
Southern California and a city Transportation and Safety Commission member; 
Joanne Baltierrez, 36, a program associate for the Coro Southern California 
nonprofit educational foundation; Edward Guzman, 37, an employment counselor 
for the state of California and a city Transportation and Safety Commission 
member, and Raul Godinez II, 31, an engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen candidates vie for three at-large seats in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Two-term incumbents Carl Boyer, 54, a history teacher, and Jo Anne Darcy, 62, 
a field deputy for Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich, met the 
filing deadline, as did former business owner/consultant Jill Klajic, 47, 
running for her second term. 
</P>
<P>
 They face return challengers Kenneth Dean, 54, an architectural interior 
designer making his fourth run; Linda Storli, a high school history teacher and 
former parks commissioner making a second run, and Fred Heiser, a 37-year-old 
Lockheed engineer from Canyon Country who unsuccessfully challenged Sen. Don 
Rogers (R-Tehachapi), for the 17th state Senate post. 
</P>
<P>
 Newcomers include Larry Bird, a 45-year-old apartment owner and manager; 
Dennis Farnham, 49, a Los Angeles police officer and small-business owner; Tim 
Jorgensen, 45, an emergency medical technician; Clyde Smyth, 62, former 
superintendent of the William S. Hart Union High School District from 1975 to 
1992, and Rosalind Wayman, 43, a deputy for Los Angeles City Councilman Marvin 
Braude. Other candidates include Chris Harder, Michael Kerr, Theodore de Vries 
and Craig Wanek, who could not be contacted Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve challengers oppose three incumbents for their Lancaster City Council 
seats. Incumbents Henry Hearns, a 60-year-old Baptist pastor; George Root, 63, 
a retired Jet Propulsion Laboratory administrator, and Arnie Rodio, 65, a 
retired small-business owner, seek second terms. 
</P>
<P>
 Challengers include Albert Blight, 60, a retired aircraft inspector; Elizabeth 
Sonleitner, a retired businesswoman; Barbara Halley-Merritt, 47, a marketing 
consultant and former chairwoman of the Lancaster Mobile Home Rent Arbitration 
Board; Deborah Shelton, 37, project director for an after-school help line and 
president of the Lancaster Coalition of Neighborhood Organizations, and William 
F. Whitlatch, 33, a technical engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 The others who have entered the Lancaster race are Michael Singer, 40, a Los 
Angeles County fire captain; Ronald Thomason, 48, on leave from the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department; homemaker Irene Flores, 46; business owner Ronald 
Main, 26; Roger Price, 39; cosmetologist Belinda Warren, 34, and Arthur Nash, 
who could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 In Palmdale, disenchanted Ross Perot supporter Rick Pamplin filed to oppose 
Mayor Jim Ledford, 40. Also running are Mike Dispenza, 55, an insurance agent 
serving on the Greater Antelope Valley Economic Development Corp. board, and 
Ron Saldivar, who could not be reached for comment.

POLICE HUNT FOR WOULD-BE CARJACKER WHO SHOT MAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police were searching Friday for a would-be carjacker who shot an 18-year-old 
man in the hip while the teen-ager and a friend were stopped at a service 
station, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began shortly before 3 p.m. at Sam's Mobil Station on the corner 
of Corbin Avenue and Sherman Way, when a man approached the driver of a 1964 
Chevrolet Impala and demanded the car, said Sgt. Paul Sciarrillo of the LAPD'S 
West Valley Division. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave the car up, but his buddy in the car didn't want to give the car up 
and tried to grab the keys, at which time the suspect shot the buddy," 
Sciarrillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman then tried to drive away, but the car stalled, Sciarrillo said, and 
the man fled on foot.  
</P>
<P>
 Police spent about 3 1/2 hours using two police dogs, a police helicopter and 
about 25 officers securing the one-block area around the station and searching 
for the robber, but were unable to apprehend him, Sciarrillo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sciarrillo said the victim, whose name was not released, was undergoing 
surgery and was in critical but stable condition Friday night.

RICK JAMES' PLEA BARGAIN LEADS TO FIANCEE'S RESENTENCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOM MROZEK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amid allegations that a district attorney's investigator provided drugs to a 
key witness, a judge on Friday agreed to resentence funk singer Rick James' 
fiancee for assaulting another woman in a sensational drug and assault case. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Superior Court Judge Michael R. Hoff set aside a four-year sentence 
given to Tanya Anne Hijazi, in light of a deal that James struck with 
prosecutors that could have him out of jail by September. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoff's decision comes in the midst of what sources say is an investigation 
into allegations that a district attorney's investigator provided drugs to a 
key witness in the case against both James and Hijazi. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijazi had pleaded guilty to assaulting a woman in a swank Sunset Boulevard 
hotel while James looked on. In a plea bargain negotiated Aug. 11, she admitted 
attacking Mary Sauger of West Hollywood at the St. James' Club & Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Hijazi was sentenced to four years in prison on Sept. 21, four days after 
James was convicted of assaulting Sauger, 35, and of providing drugs to another 
woman who alleged that she was tortured. 
</P>
<P>
 Leonard B. Levine, an attorney representing the 23-year-old Hijazi, asked Hoff 
to rescind the four-year sentence given to Hijazi in light of the deal James 
struck with prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "The motion was a very simple motion based on the simple fact that it was not 
appropriate in light of Mr. James' sentence," Levine said. "She will be 
resentenced as if she had never been sentenced before." 
</P>
<P>
 In a surprise move Jan. 7, James pleaded no contest to an assault charge and 
was sentenced to five years, four months in prison. But prosecutors agreed to 
support a petition that James be sent to a drug-rehabilitation program, a deal 
that could free him in 8 1/2 months if he successfully completes treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 James will appear in court next week to ask another judge to send him to the 
California Rehabilitation Center in Norco for drug treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 James, the self-proclaimed "King of Funk" best known for his 1981 hit "Super 
Freak," had been previously convicted on three other felony counts by a jury 
that was unable to reach a decision on other counts that carried a life prison 
term. The three charges that resulted in conviction -- assault, false 
imprisonment and furnishing drugs -- carried a term of nearly nine years. 
</P>
<P>
 Considering the James case, Levine said it was "not appropriate for Ms. Hijazi 
to be serving more time." Hoff is scheduled to resentence Hijazi on Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Levine said he met with prosecutors Thursday to discuss the investigation into 
possible wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoff has issued a gag order preventing attorneys associated with the case from 
discussing the details of the investigation, which sources said involves 
allegations that a district attorney's investigator provided drugs or other 
contraband to Michelle Allen, a woman who testified against James during his 
trial and would have testified against Hijazi.

MAN PLEADS INNOCENT TO HOLDING DOG FOR RANSOM; CRIME: IT'S THE SECOND DOGNAPING 
CASE FILED IN THE VALLEY IN THREE MONTHS. A WOMAN IS BEING HUNTED IN THE FIRST 
INCIDENT.

<P>
 A Northridge man accused of extortion for allegedly holding a family pet for 
ransom pleaded not guilty Friday in the second San Fernando Valley dognaping 
case filed in less than three months. 
</P>
<P>
 Damani Kiambo Grey, 19, is charged with abducting a 7-year-old Boston terrier 
named Maude from the Kemp family of Woodland Hills on Tuesday and demanding 
$500 for the dog's safe return. 
</P>
<P>
 Police arrested Grey Wednesday in a sting operation at a Ralphs supermarket on 
Ventura Boulevard after Grey allegedly called the dog's owners and demanded 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maude is happily back in the arms of her owners," Henri and Sandy Kemp, said 
Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert L. Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys Municipal Judge Leland Harris ordered Grey held in lieu of $25,000 
bail and scheduled a Jan. 26 preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The case comes on the heels of another dognaping incident involving Gizmo, a 
pet belonging to Virginia Davis of North Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Waynes, 20, of Encino, allegedly abducted Gizmo from a Pic 'N' Save store 
in the 15700 block of Sherman Way on Oct. 29 and later demanded ransom. Davis 
reportedly had left the dog in her car and returned to find it missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Later that evening, "there's a message on Davis' answering machine and a 
female voice says, 'If you want your dog back, it's going to cost you $200,' " 
Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Davis took a live call from a woman who identified herself as Vera and 
who agreed to accept $100 for return of the animal, according to police. But 
when Davis went to the prearranged meeting, no one showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Late on the night of Nov. 2, Davis and a friend responded to a knock on her 
front door, Cohen said. Waynes and an unidentified man were there with the dog, 
he said. When Waynes agreed to accept $20 for returning Gizmo, Davis went to 
get the money. But she returned to find that the suspects had left the dog and 
fled, according to a police report. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' friend, John O'Neill, had pulled out a gun, prompting the suspects to 
flee, leaving the dog behind, Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Davis and O'Neill obtained a license plate number that led 
authorities to Waynes. 
</P>
<P>
 Waynes has failed to appear for a court appearance and is currently being 
sought by authorities on an extortion charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Cohen said the two dognaping cases appear to be unrelated.

FIRED MAILMAN INDICTED IN SHOOTING SPREE; COURTS: MARK HILBUN IS TO BE 
ARRAIGNED TUESDAY IN THE DEATHS OF HIS MOTHER AND A FORMER CO-WORKER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An ex-letter carrier was indicted Friday in the two-day rampage in March that 
left his mother and a former co-worker dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment, authorities said, also accuses Mark Richard Hilbun of 
attempting to kill seven other people. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun, 39, is scheduled to be arraigned Tuesday in Orange County Superior 
Court on two counts of murder, seven counts of attempted murder, and one count 
each of robbery, attempted kidnaping, burglary and killing his mother's dog, 
said Deputy Dist. Atty. Bryan Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Hilbun, of San Juan Capistrano, killed his mother, 
Frances, in her Newport Beach home and shot two postal workers, one fatally, as 
he tried to kidnap Kimberly Springer at the post office where he once worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun was infatuated with Springer, who worked with Hilbun until he was fired 
in December, 1992, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment by the Orange County Grand Jury was handed up Thursday but was 
not made public until Friday. It cancels a Jan. 22 preliminary hearing on 
charges filed earlier involving the same incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagnosed as a manic-depressive, Hilbun has a history of emotional problems, 
according to police. His attorney, Deputy Public Defender David Biggs, tried 
unsuccessfully last month to have him declared mentally incapable of standing 
trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun is being held without bail in Orange County Jail, where he apparently 
attempted suicide in June by jumping from a second-story walkway. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say after he fatally stabbed his mother and her dog in her Corona 
del Mar home March 6, he drove to the Dana Point post office where he had been 
fired. 
</P>
<P>
 After allegedly killing a letter carrier, Hilbun tried to shoot another postal 
worker and the postmaster before leaving the building, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 He allegedly attacked and wounded five other people in Dana Point, Newport 
Beach and Fountain Valley during a two-day period. 
</P>
<P>
 Hilbun was arrested while drinking cocktails and watching television in a 
Huntington Beach sports bar.

300 LA HABRA HIGH STUDENTS TO BE TESTED FOR TB; HEALTH: COUNTY OFFICIALS SAY 
FAMILY AND CO-WORKERS OF A SENIOR AT THE SCHOOL, WHO HAS BEEN CONTAGIOUS SINCE 
EARLY LAST YEAR, HAVE ALREADY BEEN SCREENED. 
</P>

<P>
 Tuberculosis skin tests will be given next week to about 300 La Habra High 
School classmates of a senior female student discovered earlier this month to 
have a contagious form of the disease, county health officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Penny Weismuller, director of infectious-disease control for the Orange 
County Health Care Agency, said the student, whom she declined to identify, 
collapsed at a part-time job Jan. 5 and began coughing up blood. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was taken to Friendly Hills Regional Medical Center, where 
tuberculosis was diagnosed and reported to county health authorities. 
Weismuller said the girl, who is in the advanced stages of tuberculosis, was 
sent home from the hospital Monday under medication and won't return to school 
until laboratory tests show that her sputum is no longer infectious. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuberculosis is spread through the air, usually by coughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Weismuller said the student has been contagious at least since last February, 
when she sought treatment from a physician for a persistent cough. She said 
medical records show that the physician discovered the student had pneumonia, 
which did not respond to prescribed cough syrup or antibiotics. 
</P>
<P>
 Weismuller said classmates of the student as far back as the 1992-93 school 
year will be screened for the disease. Those classmates who have transferred to 
other schools are also being notified of the screening, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weismuller said that all but one of nine other people in the girl's household 
have been screened for tuberculosis, and all but one were found to be infected, 
although the disease has not as yet affected their lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Weismuller said, the student's co-workers have been tested. 
Results on some of those tests are pending. However, two co-workers in closest 
contact with the student had positive skin tests, although their lungs were 
clear, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because preliminary results indicate that persons who were close contacts of 
this student are infected, we are recommending skin testing of classmates of 
the last two years," Dr. Hugh Stallworth, county health officer, said in a 
prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Anderson, assistant to the superintendent of the Fullerton Joint Union 
High School District, said the district has sent letters to parents of 300 
students, "strongly recommending" that they take the skin tests to be given on 
the La Habra High campus Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that on Friday the district also sent letters in English and Spanish 
to advise parents of the remaining 1,400 La Habra High students that their 
children do not need to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Weismuller said that although the infected student worked at a business that 
serves the public, customers who came briefly in contact with her are not at 
risk for contracting the disease. "Most cases of tuberculosis are due to close, 
prolonged contact," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weismuller observed that those who may have contracted inactive tuberculosis 
infections usually can avoid the full-blown disease by taking preventive 
medication over six to nine months. 
</P>
<P>
 "People with positive skin tests have about a 10% chance of developing active 
disease in their lifetimes, and most who develop it will do so within the first 
two years after exposure," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Preventive medication, she said, can reduce by 70% to 90% the odds that the 
disease will become active. 
</P>
<P>
 After tuberculosis was discovered last year among students at La Quinta High 
School in Westminster, all 1,034 members of the student body and 189 staff 
members were tested for the disease. Seven cases of active TB were diagnosed in 
current and former students and 189 students tested positive for the bacterium. 
</P>
<P>
 A major difference at La Habra High School, Weismuller said, is that so far no 
additional active tuberculosis cases have been found, which may in part be 
attributed to the shorter exposure time. The student believed to have spread 
tuberculosis at La Quinta had the disease for three years before she got proper 
diagnosis and treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the tuberculosis bacteria strain at La Quinta resisted treatment by 
drugs. It will take two weeks before county health officers will receive 
results of laboratory tests to determine the kind of tuberculosis that has 
infected the La Habra High student, Weismuller said. However, she added that in 
both cases physicians had failed to readily diagnose tuberculosis in their 
patients. She said when the La Habra student's pneumonia failed to respond to 
antibiotics, the physician should have ordered a sputum test.  
</P>
<P>
 While tuberculosis was once virtually eradicated in the United States, it has 
resurfaced in recent years, associated with the rise in homelessness, the 
outbreak of HIV and the immigration of people from Third World countries, such 
as Mexico and Vietnam, where tuberculosis is much more common. 
</P>
<P>
 It is necessary for physicians to be more alert to the possibility of 
tuberculosis, Weismuller said. "We will be working with the Orange County 
Medical Assn. and with the Vietnamese Medical Assn. and an association of 
Hispanic doctors to provide them additional information to raise their index of 
suspicion for tuberculosis," she said.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; RABBI EARNS ROLE AS ROLE MODEL; LEADERSHIP: JERROLD 
GOLDSTEIN IS HONORED BY THE HILLEL COUNCIL FOR HIS ETHICS. HIS ACTIVISM OFTEN 
PUT HIM IN RISKY SITUATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Since the time he was jailed briefly while supporting a civil rights protest 
led by the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and through the years of helping Jewish 
college students relate their heritage to events around them, Rabbi Jerrold 
Goldstein has been an ethical role model. 
</P>
<P>
 So says the national Hillel Council, which last month honored Goldstein, 57, 
for "a professional career of exemplary ethical behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein has been the rabbi for the Cal State Northridge Hillel Council for 
the last seven years. The previous 14 years he served the same role at Valley 
College and Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 The in-house Hillel award certainly is a little-known honor. However, when 
many clergy make the news because of sexual dalliances, child molestation or 
other moral failures, it may be refreshing to hear of an ordained person cited 
for upright ethics. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it also bring unwanted pressure or scrutiny? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, I don't think there are any embarrassing ghosts in my closet," Goldstein 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been a rabbi for 30 years and I'm sure somebody along the line feels I 
didn't do right by them," he said. "I've done what I could to help students 
mature and grow in their own values and appreciation of Judaism as a resource 
in their lives." 
</P>
<P>
 He was given the Jacob Berns Ethics Award for staff recognition at the 
organization's conference on Dec. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have seen Jerry in action in a variety of settings," said Ruth Cernea, 
director of the ethics award foundation. "With Jerry, it feels right." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldstein was trained in the socially liberal Reform branch of Judaism, and 
those convictions were tested alongside the alongside the Rev. King early in 
Goldstein's career. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a story Goldstein will recount Monday night during the San Fernando 
Valley Interfaith Council's annual birthday service for King at Congregation 
Kol Tikvah in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1964, he went with 15 other rabbis to join King and his followers in St. 
Augustine, Fla., in a protest against segregated facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 As the racially mixed group moved through a section popular with tourists, it 
encountered a hostile crowd. "I still remember very angry people standing along 
the curb with broken bottles in their hands," he said. "There was only a line 
of state troopers between us and them." 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, Goldstein said: "I was paired with a black man, and he and I 
were going to go to lunch together, but we never got as far as the front door 
of the diner. We were all arrested for conspiracy, disturbing the peace and 
something else I can't remember while we were standing in a prayer circle in a 
parking lot. We spent the night in jail and eventually the NAACP posted bail to 
release us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's important for clergy to be models of the values for which we 
stand," the rabbi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently at Cal State Northridge, Goldstein had the task of helping Jewish 
students handle their objections to a November campus appearance by Nation of 
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, whom Jewish groups have accused of making 
anti-Semitic statements. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hillel Council, which is student-run, decided to hold a campus meeting on 
the day of Farrakhan's appearance, calling it A Gathering of People for 
Understanding.  
</P>
<P>
 "During the whole controversy, Jerry kept a level head and supported the 
student board in its actions," said senior Josh Epstein, who chairs the 
council. "He helped us get through some very difficult days." 
</P>
<P>
 During the farm labor union organizing efforts of the 1960s and 1970s, 
Goldstein marched with Cesar Chavez. In keeping with Reform Judaism's Central 
Conference of American Rabbis, which accused many growers of table grapes of 
exploiting workers, Goldstein endorsed the United Farm Workers' boycott of the 
product. 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day, table grapes are not kosher for this Hillel house," Goldstein 
said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SHOE STORE TAPS ITS WAY 
INTO HAPPIER DAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long before high-tech Air Jordans and disposable dress shoes danced onto the 
scene, feet dressed differently. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoes had sole, not to mention rugged double stitching and hand-carved leather 
uppers. People wore the same comfortable pair year after year and threw them 
out only as a last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Now those same chubby, rock-solid shoes of the '40s and '50s are making a 
comeback of sorts at 7605 1/2 Beverly Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The trendy little shop in West Los Angeles, named Re-Mix, specializes in shoes 
from yesteryear, including wingtips, cap toes, two-tone Spectators and a risque 
assortment of pumps. 
</P>
<P>
 The shoes are not knock-offs of originals nor refurbished "antiques." Rather, 
say the store's owners, Paul Glynn and Phil Heath, they are "dead stock," brand 
new originals painstakingly culled from warehouses and other secret sources. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to snoop around and talk to people," said Glynn, declining to 
specify his source for the shoes. "There's lot of travel, lots of small towns, 
cheap hotels and (bad) food." 
</P>
<P>
 In the year since it opened, Re-Mix has given Glynn and Heath a way to indulge 
their passion for fashion and to capitalize on the craze for all things retro.

 The store's clientele ranges from style-driven hip-hoppers to young attorneys 
to musicians George Clinton and Lenny Kravitz, and actors Kim Basinger, Laura 
Dern, Carrie Fisher and Jeff Goldbloom, according to the owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger customers tend to see the shoes as a fashion statement, mixing and 
matching Buster Brown-style little boys' shoes or orthopedically correct "Red 
Cross" granny shoes with long dresses, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Other patrons are drawn to the craftsmanship rarely found in modern models. 
</P>

 "People like the quality, the uniqueness, the details that they just don't do 
anymore," Heath said. "Manufacturers don't even spend any time promoting those 
aspects. It's buy it, wear it, throw it away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a thing about going back to a simpler, sturdier time when 
shoes were these things you lived with." 
</P>
<P>
 The shoes cost between $20 and $100, and while they can make great costume 
accessories, that's not the main reason people buy them. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 "Most of our customers by them as everyday wear," Heath said. "It's not just 
something you buy as a goof." 
</P>
<P>
 Current stock includes sturdy 1940s-era work boots, Red Ball Express sneakers 
and a pair of 1960s platforms purportedly made of marijuana hemp. There's also 
a pair of "spade shoes," just the thing to go with your zoot suit.

AFTER 7 MONTHS, RELUCTANT WITNESS MUST STAY IN JAIL 
</P>

 A Santa Ana man who has been in jail for more than seven months for refusing 
to testify in a murder case will remain in custody until he agrees to talk 
before a grand jury, a Superior Court judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Michael Brenner in a closed hearing ruled that Ronald Lawrence Azevedo, 
21, must stay in jail until he agrees to testify against two reputed gang 
members suspected in the 1992 killing of a young teacher's aide at a birthday 
party in Santa Ana, Deputy Dist. Atty.Mark A. Sevigny said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not interested in punishing Mr. Azevedo," Sevigny said. "This is a 
remedy we use only when we believe this is the only way to produce the evidence 
needed in a very serious crime." 
</P>
<P>
 But his attorney Frederick McBride said he believes his client will never talk 
and that keeping him in jail is more of a punishment than an incentive. 
</P>
<P>
 Azevedo could remain in jail until he testifies or until the 1993-94 grand 
jury steps down in June, Sevigny said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said they believe that Azevedo has information about the Feb. 3, 
1992, shooting of Joel Davalos. Davalos and his wife Sylvia, both 21, were 
attending a birthday party when gunmen burst into the back yard and opened 
fire. Joel Davalos was killed and his wife was critically wounded. Police 
determined that the victims were mistakenly targeted as rival gang members. 
</P>
<P>
 Azevedo, who was initially charged with the murder along with Artemio Rios, 
22, Luis Plascencia, 21, and Joseph Florencio Arvizu, 21, was given immunity to 
testify against the others. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Azevedo did not participate in the shooting but admitted 
that he drove the gunmen to the home and waited outside while the shooting took 
place.

SENATOR SETS SIGHTS ON GARAMENDI'S POST; POLITICS: ART TORRES RALLIES IN SANTA 
ANA FOR SUPPORT IN HIS BID FOR STATE INSURANCE COMMISSIONER. 
</P>

<P>
 One of the state's most prominent Latino elected officials tested the waters 
in Orange County on Friday, rallying a group of local politicians, business 
owners and community leaders to support his bid for state insurance 
commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the beachhead for the new Democratic Party in California," state Sen. 
Art Torres (D-Los Angeles) said of Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres told about 150 people at Trattoria Ciao restaurant on 3rd Street that 
he hopes to be the first Latino to hold a major statewide office in California 
in 119 years. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, he said: "I am not running as a Mexican; I am not running as 
a Latino. I am running as a man, able and qualified to fight the insurance 
industries . . . who happens to be a Latino." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he wants to focus on health issues, adding that the next insurance 
commissioner must coordinate President Clinton's health care plan for the state 
in 1995, if Congress approves the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for his statements on immigrant rights and immigration reform, Torres 
said he will leave legislation on those issues to his Senate colleagues. "There 
are a lot of excellent representatives who are more than competent to take on 
those issues," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly, several Santa Ana and Garden Grove council members and 
other local officials attended the event.  
</P>
<P>
 Torres is likely to face competition from Assemblyman Burt Margolin (D-Los 
Angeles) for the Democratic nomination. On the Republican side, Assemblyman 
Charles W. Quackenbush of San Jose and Wes Bannister of Huntington Beach, the 
former GOP nominee for the post, are expected to battle it out for their 
party's nomination.

JUDGE REJECTS $7.5-MILLION DAMAGE AWARD IN LIBEL CASE; LAWSUITS: A NEW TRIAL IS 
ORDERED FOR LEONARD M. ROSS IN HIS ACTION AGAINST A SANTA-BARBARA NEWSPAPER. 
THE VERDICT IS RULED EXCESSIVE AND FLAWED BY INCONSISTENCIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles judge Friday set aside a $7.5-million damage award and ordered a 
new trial for Beverly Hills attorney-businessman Leonard M. Ross against the 
Santa Barbara News-Press and its owner, the New York Times Co., ruling that the 
libel verdict was excessive and flawed by inconsistencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in October awarded Ross $7.5 million in damages following a four-week 
trial stemming from investigative reports on Ross' turbulent business career. 
Among other things, Ross contended that the Santa Barbara paper falsely linked 
him to the misdeeds of his former partner, investment whiz Barry Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 In his eight-page ruling, Superior Court Judge Harvey A. Schneider rejected a 
motion for a defense verdict -- refusing to rule that Ross had not been 
libeled. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider said he agreed with "the jury's conclusion that the defendants were 
negligent, in some respects." 
</P>
<P>
 But in ordering a new trial, Schneider said that "is not a sufficient basis 
for upholding a verdict that is inconsistent and excessive." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're gratified that the court has reversed the jury's unjustified verdict," 
said Rex Heinke, a lawyer for the News-Press, the New York Times and their 
co-defendants, reporter Kathleen Sharp and editor David McCumber. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony M. Glassman, attorney for Ross, said he will file a motion for 
reconsideration because "we think the judge has made an error." If Schneider 
refuses to reinstate the judgment, Glassman said he will probably challenge 
Friday's ruling before the Court of Appeal rather than move immediately for 
retrial. 
</P>
<P>
 Filed more than four years ago, the lawsuit stemmed from articles in November, 
1988, and February, 1989, that Ross said ruined his efforts to establish a new 
business and social life in Santa Barbara. The reports described the career of 
the man who had become the largest shareholder in Santa Barbara Savings and 
Loan, then the city's largest financial institution. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ross, 49, contended that the articles contained four false statements and had 
a defamatory "tenor and tone." After deliberating 3 1/2 days, jurors agreed 
that three disputed statements were false, and awarded damages of $5 million 
for harm to Ross' reputation and $2.5 million for emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 The heart of Ross' claim was that the reports falsely linked him to two 
federal criminal investigations that took place in the 1970s, early in his 
career -- when in fact he was investigated only once. 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged the newspaper correctly stated that he was investigated -- but 
not charged -- by a federal grand jury, the FBI and the Organized Crime Strike 
Force in the early '70s in the alleged extortion of his ex-partner, Marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ross contended -- and jurors agreed -- that the paper falsely linked him 
to a subsequent investigation of investor fraud that sent Marlin to prison. 
</P>
<P>
 It was here, however, that Schneider found inconsistencies in jury answers to 
a series of special verdict questions. While jurors said Ross had proven that 
"the tenor and tone" of the first report was that Ross was investigated along 
with Marlin for investor fraud, they elsewhere said Ross had not proven the 
falsity of a specific statement that linked him to the probe. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "There is another reason why, in the court's view, a motion for new trial must 
be granted," Schneider wrote. "Simply stated, the court finds that the damage 
award in this case was excessive." 
</P>
<P>
 Schneider noted that jurors awarded $2.5 million for emotional distress, 
although Ross never sought professional counseling and "there was no testimony 
. . . that he suffered severe or permanent harm." 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Schneider said, "the court is mindful of the chilling effect that 
such an award would have on First Amendment rights." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors also found Ross was libeled by a statement suggesting he had arranged 
an auto accident that severely injured his former lawyer, Lynn Boyd Stites, 
with whom Ross had had a bitter falling out. By coincidence, Schneider's ruling 
in the Ross case comes a day after Stites was sentenced in San Diego federal 
court to more than 12 years in prison for masterminding an elaborate insurance 
fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury award -- and Schneider's ruling Friday -- reflect two parallel 
trends: increasingly large damage awards in jury libel trials that are often 
modified after trial or on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most libel suits are dismissed. Of those that go to trial, plaintiffs win 
roughly two-thirds, and the size of awards is at an all-time high, according to 
the Libel Defense Resource Center, a New York-based group that monitors libel 
trends. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990 and 1991, nearly three of every five jury libel awards exceeded $1 
million, and more than one in four exceeded $10 million, according to data 
compiled by the group.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SPENDING FOR CITY HALL DESIGN WORK OKD; 
GOVERNMENT: PALMDALE'S MAYOR SAYS THE PROPOSED $10-MILLION BUILDING WILL SET 
THE TONE FOR DOWNTOWN RENEWAL EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The City Council has voted to spend more than $800,000 on final design work 
for a new $10-million City Hall that will be financed largely by fees paid by 
two developers. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena-based Ewing Architects will receive $684,500 to prepare the final 
construction plans and assist the builders. Los Angeles-based JCM Group will 
receive $140,000 to review the architect's plans and prepare cost estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 The architectural firm unveiled a drawing of the proposed government center 
just before council members approved the expenditures in 4-0 votes at their 
Wednesday meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's affordable elegance," Mayor Jim Ledford said of the design. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the new City Hall will set the tone for other renewal efforts in 
Palmdale's old downtown area. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the new building will allow Palmdale to consolidate city 
offices that now operate in different locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're spread out into half a dozen buildings," said Doug Dykhouse, the city's 
deputy public works director. "It's inefficient from an energy standpoint, and 
it's a burden on the public." 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale officials plan to construct the new building on city-owned land in 
the block bounded by Avenue Q-9, 8th Street East, Avenue Q-10 and 9th Street 
East. 
</P>
<P>
 The building's first phase, which is expected to cost $10 million, will house 
the city administrator's office; economic development, public works, planning, 
engineering and building and safety employees, and a new larger City Council 
chamber, seating 240. 
</P>
<P>
 The design will allow for future expansion to a 125,000-square-foot building. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale officials said that under development agreements allowing the 
construction of more than 12,000 new homes, two builders -- Kaufman & Broad and 
Ritter Park Associates -- have agreed to pay $6.9 million toward construction 
of the new City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 Dykhouse said the design work should be finished by the end of 1994. After the 
council approves final funding plans and a construction bid, building City Hall 
will take about 18 months, he said.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; PARK'S NEIGHBORS ARE ASKED TO CHIP IN; SANTA 
CLARITA: CITY HAS LEASED THE BOUQUET CANYON SITE FROM THE COUNTY. NOW IT IS 
URGING RESIDENTS TO PLAY AN ACTIVE ROLE IN ITS MAINTENANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A $1-a-year lease on 10 acres with a view may seem like a deal. But Santa 
Clarita officials were wary when they agreed to acquire Bouquet Canyon Park for 
that price. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, a park is not just a park. It's also a potential nuisance, said 
Rick Putnam, the city's parks, recreation and community services director. 
</P>
<P>
 But rather than allow the hilly expanse to be closed, city officials agreed to 
lease the park from Los Angeles County. Now they are asking the public to help 
maintain it. 
</P>
<P>
 At a meeting Wednesday, city officials will ask neighbors of the park for 
their ideas on what to do with the acreage, officially transferred to the city 
Nov. 22. Along the way, they will ask residents to perform some basic tasks of 
running the park, from patrolling the grounds to trimming the grass. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the community to feel that it's theirs," said Adele Macpherson, Santa 
Clarita's emergency preparedness coordinator and organizer of the meeting. "We 
want them to feel that it is an extension of their back yards." 
</P>
<P>
 Bouquet Canyon Park at the northeast edge of town was one of 10 parks 
transferred from the county to local jurisdictions last fall. The county said 
it needed to cut down on park maintenance costs. 
</P>
<P>
 The transfers were part of the county's gradual shift toward providing only 
the most essential public safety services in the wake of recent fiscal 
problems. But several cities were lukewarm, at best, to the prospect of 
shouldering the county's financial cast-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere in the state, counties have found that parks were items they 
couldn't even give away as local cities sought to deal with their own fiscal 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a widespread perception that parks are lacking in Santa Clarita, city 
officials weighed the drawbacks for months before finally agreeing to lease 
Bouquet Canyon Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has a $2-million annual budget for maintaining its 10 parks, Putnam 
said. That budget has not changed substantially since the city agreed to take 
over the Bouquet Canyon site, which alone costs about $50,000 a year to run. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Putnam said, the city has stretched its funds to include upkeep of 
grounds, lights and irrigation at the park. But to ensure that the park doesn't 
fall into disuse, city officials say neighbors need to take action to start 
their own beautification and recreation programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Public enthusiasm for keeping the park open has been high, Macpherson said. At 
a public meeting before the transfer, more than 50 people turned out to say 
that they supported keeping the park open.  
</P>
<P>
 Putnam said city officials are hoping that the meeting will, at the very 
least, promote interest in the park. A park that is well-used is easier to 
maintain and less likely to fall victim to vandals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond that, the city wants to extend its "Park Partners" program to Bouquet 
Canyon. The program was begun by neighbors of Begonias Park six months ago 
after that park was marred by graffiti. It recruits neighbors to walk the 
grounds and become acquainted with the youngsters who use the park. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's meeting is scheduled for 6:30 p.m. in the multipurpose room of 
Bouquet Canyon School, 28110 Welston Drive.

LAKERS FALL TO HORNETS; PRO BASKETBALL: BUT LYNCH MAKES MOST OF PLAYING TIME, 
GETTING 24 POINTS AND 10 REBOUNDS IN 130-122 LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 George Lynch, again taking advantage of playing time, was the bright spot in 
the Lakers' 130-122 loss to the Charlotte Hornets on Friday night at the Forum. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting 40 minutes, 17 more than his previous high, Lynch made 11 of 13 shots 
and scored 24 points while grabbing 10 rebounds. It was his first NBA 
double-double in only his second start. 
</P>
<P>
 When James Worthy intercepted a pass by David Wingate at halfcourt and 
streaked in for a slam dunk with a minute to play in the third quarter, the 
Lakers seemed to be rolling. 
</P>
<P>
 They had already scored 100 points and had a six-point lead against a team 
they hoped was also wearing down after having played the previous night. 
</P>
<P>
 Little did the Lakers, or the crowd of 16,011, know, it would be their last 
points for 5 minutes 4 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Nick Van Exel converted a jumper with 7:56 to play, the Hornets 
had a 107-102 lead. That cushion grew to 119-108 with 4:31 to play after Dell 
Curry's three-pointer, part of his 11 fourth-quarter points. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel made five more three-pointers to tie the Laker record for a 
regular-season game for the second time in a row. He finished with a team-high 
29 points, one fewer than Charlotte's Alonzo Mourning, who also had 17 
rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's coming back," Hornet Coach Allan Bristow said of Mourning. "His timing 
is a little off. He sort of wants to blend in, but also get back to what he was 
doing before. It's going to take a while." 
</P>
<P>
 The Hornets put Mourning back in the starting lineup after he played a reserve 
role the night before at Sacramento in his return from a sprained ankle. 
Mourning responded by scoring 14 of the Hornets' first 18 points, then appeared 
to re-injure the ankle.  
</P>
<P>
 Mourning went to the bench, and the Hornets went on a 13-0 run to take a a 
31-21 first-quarter lead, and it appeared the Lakers were going to be routed 
again by the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lakers had not forgotten the 141-124 loss at Charlotte on Nov. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remembered they kicked our butts pretty good," Coach Randy Pfund said 
before the rematch. "Dominated us on the boards. I remember the running game. 
It wasn't a bad running game for us, but we were so far behind it wasn't much 
help." 
</P>
<P>
 But instead of disintegrating, as they did in the loss in North Carolina, the 
Lakers fought back.  
</P>
<P>
 They rallied to make it 45-45 midway through the second quarter, then took the 
lead as Van Exel, after making five of seven three-pointers the last game, made 
all three attempts from that range in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Exel had 13 points by halftime, North Carolina product George Lynch had 16 
and the Lakers had a 67-65 lead, their best first-half output of the season. 
Mourning had 18 points and eight rebounds for the Hornets, despite playing only 
16 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The game was briefly tied, but the Lakers never trailed in a 33-point third 
quarter. You would never know this was the same team that had failed to break 
triple digits in scoring in 14 of the previous 18 games -- they had 100 points 
heading into the fourth quarter, good for a three-point advantage. Laker Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Some players might be thrilled to make the All-Star game, the rookie version 
or otherwise. Not Nick Van Exel. "I'll probably just try to get it over with as 
soon as possible," the Laker guard said of his participation in the NBA's 
inaugural rookie game next month at Minneapolis. "All-Star games, they're no 
fun at all. I like to win, and it seems in these games everyone tries to go out 
and have fun, not win." Said Coach Randy Pfund, when told Van Exel was less 
than enthusiastic about going: "Nick always has a different slant on things." . 
. . Antonio Harvey missed his second consecutive game because of a strained hip 
muscle.

BLACK COACHES DELAY BOYCOTT AS U.S. ACTS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: THE JUSTICE 
DEPARTMENT OFFERS TO MEDIATE DISPUTE OVER REDUCTION IN NCAA SCHOLARSHIPS.

<P>
 A walkout scheduled this weekend by the Black Coaches Assn. was averted Friday 
when the Justice Department publicly offered to mediate in the group's dispute 
with the NCAA. There was no immediate acceptance of that offer by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 The boycott had been expected during some of today's games, which coincide 
with Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Some form of protest during the season remains a possibility, the BCA said, 
even though this week's protest seemed to have lost some support. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedrick Dempsey, the NCAA's executive director, said that neither he nor NCAA 
President Joseph Crowley had heard from the Justice Department, and another 
NCAA spokesman indicated that the group would not accept the government's 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the (House) Energy and Commerce Committee and the Ways and Means Committee 
are willing to let the Justice Department mediate health-care reform, we'll 
think about using their services on these issues," the NCAA's Francis Canavan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That response probably will exacerbate the dispute between black coaches and 
leaders of America's colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Drake Coach Rudy Washington, executive director of the BCA, said action could 
eventually be taken, although he would not say when. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach George Raveling of USC, a leader in the BCA, said a walkout had been 
planned for today's game against Washington State in Pullman, Wash. 
</P>
<P>
 The coaches backed away from their threats after learning that the Clinton 
Administration was involved in the dispute. Although the White House's help was 
solicited Friday by the Congressional Black Caucus, the Community Relations 
Service of the Justice Department already had offered to intervene. 
</P>
<P>
 The Community Relations Service was organized under civil rights laws in the 
1960s to mediate disputes involving matters of race, color and national origin. 
It has no enforcement or investigative power. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.), chairman of the black caucus, said: "The Justice 
Department has expressed a desire to help mediate and arbitrate the differences 
that exist. We are asking that they look at a full range of issues. A number of 
things have festered far too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly what could come out of any mediation is unclear. NCAA rules are 
implemented and modified at its annual convention and only school 
representatives can vote to add scholarships or change academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regret the entry of the Congress or the Justice Department in this," said 
Tom Hansen, commissioner of the Pacific 10 Conference. "This is not a legal 
matter whatsoever. It is very regrettable." 
</P>
<P>
 Hansen said an arbitrator is not necessary because the NCAA has been willing 
to discuss broad issues of opportunities with the black coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the NCAA rejected a proposal to restore Division I men's basketball 
scholarships from 13 to 14 at this week's convention in San Antonio, the BCA 
chose to act. NCAA cost-containment initiatives have reduced the number of 
scholarships from 15 in 1991 to 14 last year and 13 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's 191-119 vote against the proposed increase caused a rift between the 
coaches and administrators at a time when tensions were already high. The black 
coaches said they felt betrayed because they had thought the NCAA had agreed to 
restore one scholarship. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the scholarship issue was minor, considering that many Division I 
programs do not use their allotted grants as it stands. Thus it became symbolic 
of the black coaches' fight with their institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the resulting actions in Washington, D.C., states unequivocally that 
our actions have greater magnitude than 14 scholarships," Raveling said Friday 
in Pullman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I resent all the suggestions and articles that were written suggesting that 
this was all about 14 scholarships. People found that as a convenient rationale 
to attack our credibility. It never was an economic issue, it was always an 
issue of ethics." 
</P>
<P>
 Working within the system, the coaches had lobbied administrators to adjust 
tough academic standards that they claimed limited educational opportunities of 
blacks.  
</P>
<P>
 Raveling said in November: "We don't want to go down in history known as 
people that could have made a difference but were not interested." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling's response came as the black coaches expressed concern about limits 
-- limits on the time Division I athletes are allowed to spend in organized 
off-season sports programs, and recruiting limits that inhibit the coaches from 
reaching out to inner-city neighborhoods, where they are role models. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of this has been lost behind the cry of boycott this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does appear they have seized on too narrow an issue to make too big a 
statement," the Pac-10's Hansen said. "I think they found they were going to 
face severe opposition across the country . . . more if they were going to try 
to use the student athletes (in the protest)." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling countered that administrators want to keep players ignorant of the 
overriding issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's no more than a throwback to the days of slavery," he said. "You kept 
the information away from the slaves and then you can always control them." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, administrators, commissioners and coaches expressed relief over 
Friday's action. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA Coach Jim Harrick said in Seattle: "I'm glad we get a chance to sit down 
and get everybody's sides and feelings and maybe even get some rationale." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Dan Hafner in Pullman, Wash., and Thomas Bonk in Seattle 
contributed to this story.

WEATHER OR NOT, RAIDERS LOOKING TO STAY HOT TODAY; AFC: COLD HASN'T BEEN KIND 
TO THEM THIS SEASON, BUT RECENT PLAY HAS THEM CONFIDENT AGAINST BILLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Raider quarterback Jeff Hostetler cocked his arm and fired. 
</P>
<P>
 Once, twice, three times. All on target. 
</P>
<P>
 Quick slant to Tim Brown? Bomb to James Jett? 
</P>
<P>
 Hardly. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler was throwing at his offensive linemen, not his receivers. He was 
throwing at their heads, not their hands. He was throwing snowballs, not 
footballs. 
</P>
<P>
 It was early Friday afternoon and the Raiders had just emerged from the domed 
practice facility outside Rich Stadium into a winter wonderland. 
</P>
<P>
 The falling snow, icy roads and brisk winds seemed better suited for the 
Winter Olympics than today's playoff game here between the Raiders and the 
Buffalo Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature is expected to be between zero and five degrees, with a 
wind-chill factor that could plunge it to 40 degrees below zero. Snow showers 
are also expected. 
</P>
<P>
 But the guys from sunny Southern California seemed determined not to worry 
about the hostile environment. Instead, Hostetler and his teammates were 
clowning around and talking confidently about their chances to win, despite 
their underdog role today in a game to be played before a sellout crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's talking about what new tricks we can come up with to stay warm," 
kicker Jeff Jaeger said. "But it's not like we're saying, 'Oh God, it's awful. 
We can't play in it.' It's nothing like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders will use every trick they know. The dozen trunks of equipment they 
have brought with them include hand warmers, foot warmers, gloves, capes, 
jackets and thick clothing. Some players will take advantage of the heated 
bench. Some will even put tape over the ear holes in their helmets. 
</P>
<P>
 But having done whatever they can to battle the elements, the Raiders will try 
to put that consideration out of their minds and concentrate on battling the 
Bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's your job," Buffalo defensive end Bruce Smith said of today's game. 
"You're a professional. As professionals, doctors are sometimes asked to 
deliver babies under strange circumstances. It's mind over matter. If you don't 
mind the weather, it doesn't matter." 
</P>
<P>
 Under normal circumstances, the Raiders would appear to have a lot going for 
them in this game. 
</P>
<P>
 They have already won here this season, having edged the Bills in early 
December, 25-24. 
</P>
<P>
 And that game ignited the Raider offense. Those 25 points were the most the 
team had scored, and the outburst proved to be only the beginning. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders went on to score 27 points in victories over the Seattle Seahawks 
and Tampa Bay Buccaneers. After getting shut out by the Green Bay Packers, the 
Raiders scored 33 against the Denver Broncos in their regular-season finale, 
then scored 42 last week in beating Denver in the first round of the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler, finally recovered from a series of injuries, has the passing game 
operating at peak efficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last two games, Hostetler has thrown for 604 yards and six touchdowns. 
Brown, the star receiver, caught 14 passes in the two games for 259 yards and 
three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 And even the running game, a weak link all season, has come around. Before the 
regular-season finale, the Raiders had rushed for 122 yards in the previous 
three games. 
</P>
<P>
 But they ran for 94 yards two weeks ago against the Broncos and 136 yards last 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 And each time, the Raiders got their biggest chunk of yardage from a source 
they hadn't counted on for much of the season. Two weeks ago, their leading 
rusher was Ty Montgomery, who gained 44 yards after having been used sparingly, 
if at all, for much of the season. Last week, their leading rusher was Napoleon 
McCallum, who gained 81 yards and ran for three touchdowns, equaling his season 
total a mere six weeks after an appendectomy. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to offensive numbers, the Bills can match figures with 
anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't a typical Buffalo year in terms of offense. The Bills failed to 
lead the AFC in points for the first time since 1988. But they got hot at the 
end, winning their last four regular-season games, including a 47-34 victory 
over the Miami Dolphins, to finish the season 12-4. 
</P>
<P>
 And this is the Bills' time of year. Yes, they have lost the last three Super 
Bowls, but they have had to win every AFC postseason game they've been in over 
that span to get that far. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Buffalo has won seven consecutive AFC playoff games, and six in a row 
at Rich Stadium. The last time the Bills lost a playoff game at home, the 
opponent was the Kansas City Chiefs and the date was Jan. 1, 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those Buffalo playoff victories was the 51-3 destruction of the Raiders 
in the 1991 AFC title game, a game that still has some in silver and black 
shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bills played only one postseason game at Rich Stadium last season, but 
that one left everybody shaking their heads, believers as well as nonbelievers. 
</P>
<P>
 Trailing the Houston Oilers in the third quarter of their first playoff game 
of last season, 35-3, the Bills pulled off the biggest comeback in NFL history 
by scoring five touchdowns in the second half, three of them in just more than 
four minutes, en route to a 41-38 overtime victory. 
</P>
<P>
 But the weather figures to exert its own unavoidable influence on today's 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams have had some practice under these conditions. Buffalo played the 
New York Jets here three weeks ago and won, 16-14, in weather that, considering 
the wind-chill factor, dropped to 28 below zero. 
</P>
<P>
 The same day, the Raiders were in Green Bay, where they didn't fare as well. 
Playing in wind-chill-factored minus 22 degrees, the Raiders were shut out, 
28-0, playing on a field that more closely resembled a sheet of ice. The Raider 
offensive line gave up eight sacks and Hostetler wound up in the hospital with 
a concussion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders also lost a cold-weather game in Cincinnati this season to the 
Bengals, who were 0-10 at the time, and hung on to win a cold-weather game in 
Chicago only because usually reliable Kevin Butler missed two short field-goal 
attempts for the Bears in the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The only cold-weather game the Raiders have won this season was here, but the 
temperature that day was 37 degrees, balmy compared to what is expected today. 
</P>
<P>
 If the wind and cold blunt the passing game today, this battle will be won on 
the ground, where McCallum, Montgomery and fullback Steve Smith will be matched 
up against Thurman Thomas, the AFC rushing leader with 1,315 yards, and Kenneth 
Davis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weather is the same for both sides," Buffalo linebacker Darryl Talley 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 That's what the Raiders keep telling themselves. Raider Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Receiver-return man Rocket Ismail, who sat out last week's game and most of 
the previous game because of a sprained neck, will play. . . . The Bills have 
no serious injuries. . . . The local television blackout was lifted Friday when 
six corporations bought out the remaining tickets. Five thousand of the 80,290 
seats in Rich Stadium had been unsold as of Friday morning. The Blue Zone 
</P>
<P>
 According to a National Weather Service advisory for the Buffalo area, "All 
travelers should exercise caution."  
</P>
<P>
 It was nice enough not to add, "This means you, Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature for today's playoff game at Rich Stadium is expected to be 
between zero and five degrees and winds of 15 to 30 m.p.h. could produce 
wind-chill readings equivalent to 20 to 40 below zero. To make things worse, 
snow showers are expected.

MIKE DOWNEY: HE WANTS THE DEFENSE TO HAVE IT HIS WAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nolan Harrison personifies the hunger of the Raiders. He is a huge man with a 
stovepipe neck who occupies the right tackle position, sandwiched in between 
the brawny likes of Greg Townsend and Howie Long on the defensive line, where 
together at today's AFC playoff game they will go stomping and clomping toward 
Buffalo's quarterbacks and halfbacks the way dinosaurs once went after dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 One recent morning, when the stomach of the 6-foot-5, 285-pound Harrison began 
rumbling before the rest of him did, he was preparing to devour a number of 
those slapped-together breakfast creations they sell at a popular quick-fix 
restaurant better known for its burgers, when on impulse he volunteered: "I can 
eat 10 of these." 
</P>
<P>
 "Can not," Raider defensive end Anthony Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Can, too," Harrison insisted. 
</P>
<P>
 So, the bet was on. Before witnesses, Harrison would wolf down 10 of these 
thick and chewy patties. Smith and others would observe. It was reminiscent of 
the scene from that chain-gang movie where Paul Newman proposed that he could 
swallow 50 hard-boiled eggs inside of an hour. Newman's character won the 
wager, though not before his belly swelled like the membrane on a bongo. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison dug in. One breakfast patty. Two patties. Three patties. Patty cake, 
patty cake, Raiders' man. Digging into the paper sack, Smith handed over one 
after another, then watched with amazement and amusement. Chomp, chomp, gone. 
Chomp, chomp, gone. Harrison was putting those patties away like a porpoise at 
Sea World being rewarded with tiny treats, barely coming up for air. The man 
had a hollow gut. 
</P>
<P>
 He was too busy chewing, meanwhile, to keep count. In his gluttony, what 
Harrison never realized was that the naughty Smith had actually ordered more 
than 10 of the breakfast delights. He kept force-feeding Harrison even after 
his teammate had won the bet. Eleven patties. Twelve patties. Harrison washed 
them down, wiped his mouth and said please, sir, may I have another? He became 
the Oliver Twist of Burger King. And happily, biting his lip to keep from 
laughing, Smith obliged his friend, until finally there was nothing remaining 
of 14 or 15 snacks but an empty sack. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won," Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 If only the Buffalo Bills would go down as easily. To say that Harrison and 
his companions are win-starved would be inane but accurate, particularly since 
Nolan played his college football at Indiana and therefore has never known the 
satisfaction of vying for a championship. This appointment of his today, coming 
as it does 10 days before his 25th birthday, is of considerable importance to 
Harrison, despite the age difference between him and the senior NFL citizens 
who line up by his side. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison has become one of the most vocal spokesmen of the Raiders, perhaps 
their most voluble player. His corner locker in the clubhouse, first one by the 
door, draws crowds the way Bob Golic's once did. It is Harrison who hectored 
not only opponents but his own team's fans, openly disparaging them for failing 
to turn out in greater numbers. At one point he all but wailed: "We're such a 
good team -- where the hell is everybody?" 
</P>
<P>
 He was as ecstatic as anyone last Sunday when the joint was jumping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that's what I call 'fans!' " Nolan said afterward. "Those people didn't 
have to be asked to make noise. They came to make noise. They did their part 
and, hey, we did our part." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a shame that there will be no more home games this season for the 
Raiders, just when their own arena had become as much a factor as Denver's 
snowball-throwers or Houston's house of pain or Cleveland's rabid dog pound. 
After experiencing the Coliseum last week, one newspaper columnist from 
Harrison's hometown of Chicago wrote that it made that dog pound look like a 
petting zoo. Small wonder there was such a big grin creasing Harrison's face. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a suburban kid, actually, whose high school was archrival to that of 
one of America's less witty newspaper columnists. (Ahem.) Harrison's school, 
Homewood-Flossmoor, has always been known for its outstanding academics as well 
as athletics, and much of its student body hails from families that could 
fairly be labeled upper-middle class. Suffice to say, no student from H-F has 
to endure graffiti-marred hallways or radiator steam heat. 
</P>
<P>
 So versatile was Harrison when he enrolled there that not only did his 
exceptional upper-body strength serve him as a two-way lineman and championship 
wrestler, but his legs earned him a letter in track and field -- not in the 
shotput or discus but in the 400-meter run. He took pride in his naturally 
achieved strength and took umbrage at the publicity given steroid-developed 
monsters. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison does have a temper. Away from the game he can be clever and charming, 
but beware of those moments when he is not. He uprooted an automated teller 
machine from a bank once, in anger. Harrison got so hot at work one afternoon, 
he hurled an opponent's helmet a good 20 yards. And when an acquaintance 
chanced to encounter Harrison at a recent New Year's Eve party, he couldn't 
help but notice that before the night was over, Nolan had gotten himself into 
another nasty quarrel. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet you can't expect the Raiders to employ librarians. Harrison has entrenched 
himself in defensive coach Ray Hamilton's front four because of his ferocity 
and fire. Although he has never been confused with, say, Bruce Smith of the 
Bills, and during the last two weeks against Denver made fewer tackles than 
usual, Harrison has excelled this season at rushing the passer. He hopes to 
size up Jim Kelly today like an hors d'oeuvre. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a game where we've got to give everything we have," Harrison said. 
"We don't have our home field. We don't have our home fans. We don't have our 
home sunshine. If our defense doesn't put pressure on Jim Kelly, we could be in 
for a long day. If our defense puts pressure on Jim Kelly the way we're capable 
of putting pressure on Jim Kelly, then he could be in for a long day." 
</P>
<P>
 Additional pressure is Harrison's today because the junior partner of his 
front four, Chester McGlockton, has a broken leg and comparatively 
inexperienced Willie Broughton will occupy the left defensive tackle hole in 
his stead. So overanxious was Broughton when pressed into service last weekend 
that afterward he admitted to nearly having hyperventilated. But Harrison has 
faith in his linemate and says, "Don't worry about Willie, because he's going 
to do fine." 
</P>
<P>
 There will be 11 men lined up across from them today, 11 blue-plate specials. 
Anthony Smith munched on small "Buffalo" chicken wings after a Raider practice 
the other day, merely to whet his appetite for things to come. And back in the 
suburbs of Chicago, where guys with guts have been known to boast that they 
could eat any number of brownie-sized White Castle hamburgers in a single 
setting, Harrison, too, learned how to fuel himself for a big game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the battle is how much you want it," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 And the other half? 
</P>
<P>
 "Finishing it."

FAVORED 49ERS TAKE ROLE OF UNDERDOG; NFC: SAN FRANCISCO APPEARS WORRIED AFTER 
TWO LOSSES, BUT GIANTS' REEVES ISN'T BUYING IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Francisco 49ers lost their two final regular-season games, three of 
their last four, appear defenseless in stopping the run, and Steve Young is not 
Joe Montana. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it is all coming together for the 49ers, a game plan for success, and 
at just the right time. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are favored today to defeat the New York Giants in the NFC 
divisional playoff game at Candlestick Park, the 49ers don't think they have 
anyone's respect. They have heard the talk, the predictions of an upset. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think a lot of people expect us to beat the Giants, so in a sense the 
pressure is off of us," 49er tackle Steve Wallace said. "We just have to have 
the mind set that no matter what happens, we're going to sit in there and 
battle." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers stumbled down the stretch, losing to Buddy Ryan's Houston defense 
and Bubby Brister's Philadelphia offense, and now are telling themselves that 
no one is giving them a chance to recover. This week's theme: "It's us against 
the nonbelievers," and although that idea is nowhere near original, it is 
something new for a team that has won at least 10 games in 12 of the last 13 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, we've been a team that people think will dominate," said Harris 
Barton, the other 49er tackle. "Now we feel as if our backs are against the 
wall." 
</P>
<P>
 Giant Coach Dan Reeves, however, is not buying the 49ers' routine. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to catch a team that's been working like crazy because they lost 
the last two games," Reeves said. "They've got a tremendous amount of talent, 
but also a tremendous amount of pride. We're going to catch them at a bad time, 
that's for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time Reeves went up against the 49ers in postseason play was in Super 
Bowl XXIV, when he was still coaching the Denver Broncos. San Francisco 
triumphed, 55-10, with Montana throwing five touchdown passes, three to Jerry 
Rice. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeves said: "It's important, not only to control the ball against a team like 
this, but to score, because they have a tendency to score a lot of points. We 
have to score touchdowns and not settle for field goals." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants will run the ball to keep it away from Young, Rice and Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers will also try to hog the ball with a short passing game and the 
running of Ricky Watters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to get into a scoring contest with the 49ers," New York 
quarterback Phil Simms said. "That is the last thing we want to do. If it's 
like that, we won't win. We will do what we always do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants will run Rodney Hampton, and continue to run him as long as his 
body allows. In last week's wild-card victory over Minnesota, Hampton ran 33 
times for 161 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "In past years, we've had some pretty good players, established players like 
Pierce Holt, Kevin Fagan and Michael Carter," 49er Coach George Seifert said. 
"That's a pretty good group of run defenders. We don't have those players now. 
We've had our problems and we have yet to establish ourselves defensively." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers gave up an NFL-high 4.5 yards per rush this season and the Giants 
have the league's No. 1 rushing offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Giants are physical," San Francisco safety Tim McDonald said. "They are 
going to take the ball to you and say, 'Here it is. Either you stop it or we're 
going to make you quit.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Last week they really punished Minnesota, a good defensive team. They made 
them look really bad. They did whatever they wanted to do with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Hampton's effective running has allowed Simms to re-establish himself as one 
of the league's top quarterbacks. Simms, 38, has not had a pass intercepted in 
his last seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 "Phil has been great all year, doing the things that great quarterbacks have 
to do," Reeves said. "He doesn't make the mistakes that will cost you some 
ballgames, and he comes up with some big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants had a league-low 17 turnovers this season, and as a result, led the 
league in time of possession, averaging 32 minutes 18 seconds per game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to do the same thing that the Giants are doing," Rice said. 
"They take the ball, use a lot of time, and with the type of defense they play, 
they are not going to give up the big play. We are going to have to work 
underneath, catch the ball, and then hold onto it and try to advance the ball 
up the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I feel like this is the biggest game of my career. You know, 
these guys have done a pretty good job on me." 
</P>
<P>
 Rice has 27 catches for 454 yards and four touchdowns in six regular-season 
games against the Giants. But he has only 12 receptions for 147 yards and no 
touchdown in three playoff meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be the ultimate challenge for the receivers to make something 
happen," Rice said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants' defense, which gave up the fewest points in the NFL, tied for 10th 
in defending against the pass. The Giants, however, did not play against Young 
this season, the league's No. 1-rated quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Young threw a league-high 29 touchdown passes with 16 interceptions, but has 
yet to lead the 49ers into a Super Bowl. Young is 1-1 in playoff starts with 
six turnovers. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can take yourself to a level above, and you do that by going to a Super 
Bowl," said Young, who continues to fight the Montana mystique. "Everyone wants 
to be a Super Bowl quarterback. Joe was the classic. Four times, four out of 
four. But then we went to the playoffs nine times during that time." 
</P>
<P>
 With Young at quarterback, the 49ers scored more points than any other team in 
the league, but isn't Dallas a prohibitive favorite to advance to the Super 
Bowl? Aren't the Giants most people's best bet to spring an upset this weekend? 
</P>
<P>
 "We're playing a very sound football team and we haven't played very sound," 
Seifert said. "We haven't played well. We haven't blocked or tackled anybody 
with any efficiency and our timing has really been off. We haven't done 
anything to establish ourselves as of late." 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers are down and out, or so they would like everyone to think. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got people speculating a little bit and saying, 'Well, they are not 
playing well,' " Rice said. "That's great, because I feel we have an 
opportunity to go into this game and almost do the impossible because no one is 
expecting the 49ers to move on."

DUCKS NEED BIGGEST COMEBACK TO END LOSING STREAK AT HOME; HOCKEY: THEY GET FOUR 
GOALS IN 6:04 SPURT DURING SECOND PERIOD AND BEAT WHALERS, 6-3. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Mighty Ducks didn't bother with gimmicks such as wearing their road 
jerseys at home or sleeping in a hotel the night before their latest attempt to 
win a home game. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they broke their five-game Anaheim Arena losing streak with a lot of 
resolve and a little elbow grease. 
</P>
<P>
 No one could accuse them of doing it the easy way, as they fell behind by 
three goals before taking a 6-3 victory over the Hartford Whalers on Friday in 
front of 17,174, their fifth consecutive sellout. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first time in their 46-game history they have overcome a three-goal 
deficit to win. Garry Valk's empty-net goal with 34 seconds left after goalie 
Jeff Reese was pulled for an extra attacker started the victory celebration -- 
the Ducks' first at Anaheim Arena since they beat St. Louis on Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a big monkey off our back," said Tim Sweeney, who had two goals. "We 
were beginning to think we would never win at home again." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks also got two goals and an assist from Patrik Carnback, who started 
the game centering the tough-guy line with Stu Grimson and Todd Ewen. But a few 
minutes into the game, Coach Ron Wilson put him with wingers Sweeney and former 
Whaler Terry Yake. The move paid off big, with the line contributing four 
goals. 
</P>
<P>
 It looked like more of the same lethargic home play when the Ducks dug a 3-0 
hole, but they came alive in the second period. With four goals in a 6:04 
outburst, they took a 4-3 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Carnback got it started when he shoved across the second rebound at 10:47 
after Yake took a swipe at the rebound of defenseman Don McSween's shot. 
Sweeney had created the opportunity when he took the puck from defenseman James 
Patrick in the neutral zone. 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of minutes later, with the Ducks trying to kill Shaun Van Allen's 
hooking penalty, Bob Corkum and Valk jumped out front on a two-on-one break. 
Corkum kept the puck and beat Reese for a short-handed goal, cutting the lead 
to 3-2. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney scored the tying goal from low in the right circle off a pass from 
Carnback at 14:46. Carnback scored the go-ahead goal a little more than two 
minutes later, when defenseman David Williams' perfect pass up the middle sent 
him out on a breakaway. Carnback switched from his forehand to his backhand and 
then back to his forehand to beat Reese easily at 16:51. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Ducks' second four-goal period of the season, along with one during 
a 7-2 victory at Winnipeg last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The odd-man rushes kept piling up, and the Ducks took a 5-3 lead at 3:23 of 
the third when McSween, a journeyman defenseman who signed with the Ducks this 
week, dropped the puck back to Sweeney on another two-on-one. The goal was 
Sweeney's second of the night and eighth of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' resolve to put up stiffer opposition at home was punctured 29 
seconds into the game, when defenseman Zarley Zalapski swept unchecked to pick 
up a rebound and put it in the net. 
</P>
<P>
 By early in the second period, the Ducks trailed, 3-0, after Michael Nylander 
converted a power-play rebound at 9:17 of the first and Brian Propp scored at 
3:58 of the second.

THE NHL; JIMMY CARSON GETS ANOTHER FRESH START -- IN VANCOUVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY WIGGE, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jimmy Carson has heard arguments why he could and could not make it in the NHL 
since before he was drafted in June 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny, but my career has been a series of 'He can do this' and 'He can't 
do that,' " Carson says. "I remember being in the hotel room next to the Kings 
in Montreal in 1986 and listening to them argue about me through the walls. 
Most of it was good back then." 
</P>
<P>
 Carson went second after Joe Murphy in that draft and scored 37 and 55 goals 
in his first two seasons with the Kings. His career was on such a high that the 
Oilers insisted he be part of the Wayne Gretzky trade in August 1988. Then, 
after getting 49 goals in his only full season in Edmonton, he walked out on 
the Oilers, demanding a trade to a U.S. team. The Southfield, Mich., native, 
got his wish, going to Detroit for Murphy, Adam Graves, Petr Klima and Jeff 
Sharples. Last January 29, he was traded back to the Kings for All-Star 
defenseman Paul Coffey. 
</P>
<P>
 Not many can boast of being traded for future Hall of Fame players such as 
Gretzky and Coffey. But Carson is a talented player. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he's on the move again, having been traded to Vancouver for left wing 
Dixon Ward and a draft choice to be determined by how Carson plays for the 
Canucks. The Kings also agreed to pick up part of Carson's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson, 25, has lived up to the arguments heard through the thin walls of that 
Montreal hotel in 1986 by averaging 37 goals in his first seven seasons. But he 
had only four goals in 25 games this season, and he was benched for six Stanley 
Cup playoff games last spring and for 11 regular-season games this season, 
including five in a row since December 23. 
</P>
<P>
 He was given a three-year, $3.3-million contract before this season and 
promised more ice time. But he was caught in the middle of a dispute between 
Kings General Manager Nick Beverley and Coach Barry Melrose. That's the major 
reason he was traded for the fourth time in his career. 
</P>
<P>
 He rejoins Canucks G.M.-Coach Pat Quinn, Carson's first NHL coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious he seemed to be at the end of his rope with Barry Melrose," 
Quinn says. "The trade is a risk, let's face it. We don't know what has 
happened between Jimmy and his coach. Maybe there is something we don't know 
about, but the up side for us is good." 
</P>
<P>
 We reported Carson-for-Ward and Carson-for-Dana Murzyn rumors more than a 
month ago, but Quinn finally was forced to make a move. It became apparent he 
could not trade holdout center Petr Nedved before Nedved's self-imposed Monday 
deadline -- Nedved, playing for Team Canada, will not be available for a trade 
until after the Olympics -- and after Cliff Ronning left the lineup because of 
a shoulder separation. 
</P>
<P>
 Not exactly a ringing endorsement for Carson, but if Quinn puts Carson next to 
Pavel Bure and they find magic, Carson probably won't even mind playing in 
Canada again because he would be able to say, "I told you so," to the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wish this was handled differently in the summertime, before I signed 
the contract," Carson says. "We were given strong assurances that the coach 
wanted me and would play me. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we were struggling early, I thought I could help. But getting two or 
three shifts a game isn't exactly getting a chance to play. The whole situation 
was a little unusual, and I'm happy I'll be getting a chance to play in 
Vancouver." 
</P>
<P>
 Ward, 25, is 6 feet, 200 pounds. He gives Melrose the size and feistiness he 
likes so much. Ward had 22 goals and 30 assists as a rookie last season but had 
six goals in 33 games this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jimmy has offensive talent," Melrose says. "But I have Gretzky and Jari 
Kurri. In the scheme of things, there wasn't room for another offensive player. 
It was like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole." 
</P>
<P>
 If walls could talk, we probably would have heard a loud sigh of relief from 
both teams. But we believe Vancouver got the better of this deal because Carson 
is again going to feel appreciated playing under Quinn. And a Carson-Bure 
combination and all the goals that should produce are enough to wake up the 
Canucks' dormant offense and allow them to challenge the Flames for their third 
consecutive division title. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Those Gary Bettman bashers in Canada who look at the commissioner as an 
American lawyer who is not worried about Canada and the tradition of the game 
can thank Bettman for smoothing over the differences between Oilers Owner Peter 
Pocklington and the Northlands Coliseum Authority. He pushed the two sides 
closer to a resolution that will keep the Oilers in Edmonton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fire is no longer spreading," says Bettman, who had a meeting with mayors 
in Edmonton, Calgary, Winnipeg and Quebec City last week and warned them it was 
up to them to "protect their assets." 
</P>
<P>
 Edmonton Mayor Jan Reimer, who will serve as mediator between the two groups, 
hints that some public money could be made available to help settle the 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Look for a new agreement to be reached by the end of January. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The Senators' Bob Kudelski took the pregame warmup and was in the dressing 
room preparing for a game at Toronto last week when he was taken aside and told 
he had been traded to Florida for forwards Evgeny Davydov and Scott Levins and 
two draft choices. The deal was completed just before the national anthems. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't help the Senators, losing a 26-goal scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, it had an effect," center Mark Lamb says of the club's 6-3 loss to the 
Maple Leafs. "All of a sudden, we are down a player, missing our leading 
scorer." 
</P>
<P>
 Kudelski told last week that he expected to be traded to a contending team 
before the March 19 trade deadline. Now that they have Kudelski, the Panthers 
are a playoff contender. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Icy bits: Islanders Coach Al Arbour would never send a player off his bench to 
fight, but he is responsible for having a player such as Mick Vukota on his 
bench, just like any other coach. That's why Arbour's five-game suspension and 
$1,000 fine for not keeping Vukota from leaving the bench and joining a fight 
are justified. Rule 66 also says Vukota gets a 10-game suspension and the 
Islanders are fined $10,000 for the incident. ... If you wonder why the 
Blackhawks aren't among the league's Top 5 teams, it's because they don't get 
scoring from their second-line players. They are one of six teams that have 
three or fewer players in double figures in goal scoring. Last week, they tried 
banger Jocelyn Lemieux on the second line with Brent Sutter and Dirk Graham. 
But Lemieux, who had 22 goals the last three seasons, isn't the answer. ... 
Flyers Coach Terry Simpson told defenseman Dimitri Yushkevich to forget about 
the trade rumors, he's not going anywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't be surprised if the 52-save performance by Calgary goalie Andrei 
Trefilov in his '93-94 debut last week puts veteran Flames goalie Mike Vernon 
on the trade market. ... Former Flyers and Canucks coach Bob McCammon is 
looking for an NHL coaching job. He could be headed for Ottawa -- very soon. 
... What's wrong with this story? Ray Sheppard and Vyacheslav Kozlov get three 
goals apiece, but Bob Probert gets credit for sparking Detroit's 10-3 victory 
at San Jose last week by starting a fight 14 seconds into the game. You can't 
rationalize that Sergei Fedorov and Steve Yzerman need someone to "ride shotgun 
for them just like Wayne Gretzky had Dave Semenko and Marty McSorley with him," 
as Red Wings G.M. Bryan Murray says. The opposing defensemen and goalies will 
tell you that intimidation is Fedorov and Yzerman on a breakaway, not Probert 
through a punch or two.

MORNING BRIEFING: FOR GIANTS, VICTORY IN '91 WAS JUST DIVINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 New York Giant safety Greg Jackson recently recalled the fervent state his 
team was in during the waning moments of their 1991 playoff against the San 
Francisco 49ers at Candlestick Park: "Those last few minutes, we were all 
praying," he told George Willis of Newsday. "And I mean praying like we've 
never prayed before." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Giants, who were seemingly out of the game before Lawrence Taylor 
recovered a fumble by Roger Craig with two minutes remaining, their NFC 
championship hinged on a 42-yard field-goal attempt by Matt Bahr on the game's 
final play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of us didn't want to look. Some did. It was a tense moment," Jackson 
recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 The kick was good, giving the Giants a 15-13 victory and sending them to the 
Super Bowl in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who holds the Raider record for most touchdown passes in a 
postseason game? 
</P>
<P>
 Bay Area confusion: The San Francisco 49ers start the playoffs today having 
lost three of their last four games, and to hear Coach George Seifert talk, the 
team is in total disarray.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know where the hell we are right now," Seifert said the other day. 
"It doesn't matter who might come in this next game. It could be anybody, 
Cincinnati, anybody. It's a little bit of a chaotic situation and I haven't 
seen it before. That's just the state we're in." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked specifically if he was looking forward to the playoffs, Seifert said, "I 
look forward with fear, actually." 
</P>
<P>
 Just a fact: Four of the last five times the Giants and 49ers have met in the 
playoffs, the winner has gone on to win the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Got a bridge to sell you: Art Spander of the San Francisco Examiner on 
7-foot-6 Philadelphia rookie center Shawn Bradley: 
</P>
<P>
 "Did they give $44 million for eight years or $8 million for 44 years? Either 
way, it wasn't much of a bargain. The Golden Gate bridge was available for a 
lot less. And the Philadelphia 76ers would probably get just as much use." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1967, the Green Bay Packers defeated the Kansas 
City Chiefs in Super Bowl I at the Coliseum, 35-10, before a crowd of 61,946. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia answer: Daryle Lamonica, with six against Houston, Dec. 21, 1969.

DEFENSE KEY FOR TEAM USA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With 53 games behind him and the first Olympic faceoff only four weeks away, 
Team USA Coach Tim Taylor remains concerned about his hockey players' defensive 
shortcomings. 
</P>
<P>
 "In selecting this team, we looked for speed, skill and hockey sense, and in 
doing that, we perhaps did not look at the defensive end of the game," he 
said."We ended up with a team with a lot of players who are skilled and gifted 
offensively. In losing to San Jose (5-4 last Saturday) we took 38 shots and 
held them to 18. We scored four goals, which has to be enough to win a hockey 
game. We've got to keep working on our defense." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor expects tonight's game against Canada at Denver's McNichols Arena to be 
an Olympic preview. The teams will meet in the third game of the Olympic 
tournament on Feb. 17 at Lillehammer, Norway. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. team is 33-15-5 in its pre-Olympic games, 5-1-1 against Canada.

DOES BODY CLOCK HOLD KEY FOR RAIDERS?; PRO FOOTBALL: FORMER TEAM DOCTOR ADVISES 
MEASURES TO HELP THEM ADJUST TO TRAVEL TO THE EAST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the Raider team doctor, Robert Huizenga couldn't help but notice that 
players had trouble adjusting to East Coast trips. One clue was watching 
players' heads fall into their plates during pregame meals. Another was finding 
them asleep in the locker room before games. 
</P>
<P>
 So he started studying the effects of team performance and time-zone travel, 
and he saw the pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 "It turned out that jet lag can affect NFL performance," said Huizenga, who 
was the team doctor from 1983 through 1990. "West Coast teams are affected more 
when they play East Coast morning games, and East Coast teams have a 
disadvantage when they come West for Monday night games. Then, (East Coast 
teams) are playing football at midnight (on their body clocks), and our bodies 
aren't made for that." 
</P>
<P>
 Huizenga says that peak performance time is early to late afternoon, which he 
believes could help explain the Raiders' playoff disaster after the 1990 
season, when they lost to the Bills in Buffalo in a 1 p.m. EST game, 51-3. 
Today, the Raiders will play again in Buffalo at 12:30 EST, which is 9:30 a.m. 
on their body clocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Your brain clock is tightly hooked to the light-dark cycle," Huizenga said, 
explaining why the west-to-east syndrome differs from east-to-west. "When you 
go across multiple time zones, your 24-hour clock gets out of sync with the 
light-dark schedule, the sun's 24-hour cycle. It becomes confused. You get 
headaches, fatigue, sleep deprivation, detrimental performance in your 
heart-lung function. Your balance is slightly altered. 
</P>
<P>
 "Players need to have their pregame meal four hours before the game, which is 
5:30 a.m. -- which means they need to wake up at 4:30 on their body clock. All 
of us know that is not easy for someone who is used to waking up at 8 or 9 
o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
 Raider Coach Art Shell changed the Raiders' practice time this week in Los 
Angeles, moving it up from 2 p.m. to 9:30 a.m. so the players' body clocks 
would start adjusting. That's the first step that Huizenga advises. 
</P>
<P>
 "A team should also leave two to three days before the game to get to the East 
city, and leave at such a time that they would arrive early in the day," he 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Then the players should go to sleep two, three hours earlier than usual and 
maybe take a sleeping pill the first night so they can sleep. Then they will 
wake up in the early morning on Buffalo time and their system can start to 
shift so that when they play at 1 in the afternoon, their body thinks it is the 
afternoon and not the morning." 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders left Los Angeles at 3:30 p.m. Thursday and arrived about 11:30 in 
Buffalo. Shell scheduled practice for 12:30 EST Friday to keep the players on 
the same time clock. 
</P>
<P>
 Huizenga spent three years analyzing 10 years of won-lost records from 27 NFL 
teams to determine the jet lag effect on a club's performance. His study, 
co-authored with researcher Rick Jehue and statistician Dennis Street, examined 
teams from 1978 to 1987 and has been published in Medicine and Science in 
Sports and Exercise magazine.  
</P>
<P>
 Huizenga's analysis of NFL teams also included findings on home-field 
advantage and Monday night games. He found that home teams won 56.6% of the 
time, and West Coast teams, whether home or away, have a distinct advantage 
over Eastern and Central time teams in Monday night games.  
</P>
<P>
 "One team that made some changes when playing East Coast games was the San 
Diego Chargers (during the late '70s and early '80s)," Huizenga said. "They 
would have early-morning practices and fly out early. There were too few games 
to make a statistical study, but it looked like it helped them."

ANGELS HOPE FOR A CHANGE IN ANAHEIM STADIUM LEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jackie Autry, executive vice president of the Angels, said Friday she is 
unsure where it will lead but hopes to open negotiations with the city of 
Anaheim soon on a lease extension at Anaheim Stadium or revision of the terms 
in the current contract, which expires in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry said she recently received a letter from Mayor Tom Daly -- motivated, 
perhaps, by the possible loss of the Rams -- in which he said the city would 
like to explore an extension. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry said she hoped talks could begin by the end of February. That's when an 
appellate court is expected to rule on the 10-year legal battle between the 
city and team on plans formulated between the city and Rams to build office 
structures and a high-rise parking garage in the stadium parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Autry said Friday that the team would not stay if those plans go forward. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had casual conversations with other cities in Orange County and are 
receptive to any proposal that would put us in a baseball-only facility," she 
said "We don't want to move, but Anaheim Stadium has become out of date from a 
baseball standpoint. Even when we draw 40,000, and we're happy to draw 40,000, 
it looks half empty." 
</P>
<P>
 Autry also said that any lease extension would have to include major changes 
from the current terms. The Angels receive half of the parking revenue and 60% 
of the net profit from concessions. They receive nothing from the luxury suites 
except a commitment by the Rams to buy a modest number of tickets. Their rent 
is 7 1/2% of the revenue from the first 2 million admissions and 10% of the 
revenue over that. They also pay a fee on each admission to finance the stadium 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Future negotiations, Autry said, will be based on leases the Baltimore 
Orioles, Texas Rangers and Cleveland Indians have received in their new 
stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pittsburgh has the worst least in baseball and we have the second-worst," she 
said. "There has to be changes for the Angels to be competitive, but I don't 
know how receptive the city will be." 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said the city was only trying to get an early start by offering lease 
negotiations at this time. Asked about the possibility of stadium renovations, 
he said, "Under the right circumstances, anything is possible." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he did not anticipate the Angels leaving, because Anaheim and Orange 
County remain "a great sports market."

O'MALLEY SPEAKS HIS MIND; BASEBALL: DODGER PRESIDENT SAYS CLAIMS THAT 
BIG-MARKET TEAMS AREN'T DOING ENOUGH TO ATTAIN REVENUE-SHARING PACKAGE ARE 
'OUTRAGEOUS.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Amid increasingly strained relations between baseball's large- and 
smaller-revenue teams, Dodger President Peter O'Malley said Friday that he is 
outraged by suggestions from some of those smaller teams that the big-market 
teams aren't seriously trying to negotiate a revenue-sharing formula. 
</P>
<P>
 "The clubs putting money into the pot have made an extraordinary effort to be 
creative, to reach out and satisfy the quote smaller unquote teams to the 
maximum extent that we can," the normally low-key O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the smaller clubs feel we aren't, I'm sorry about that, but we can't be 
expected to pay for their mismanagement. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some small-market clubs to accuse us of a charade, to accuse us of just 
dancing around the subject, ticks me off. It's really irritating. It's 
outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 The owners will again try to resolve their differences Tuesday during a 
three-day meeting in Ft. Lauderdale, Fla. Fans, however, might take more 
interest in Wednesday's scheduled vote on a commissioner. The search committee 
is expected to make its recommendation to the executive council Monday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Schiller, executive director of the U.S. Olympic Committee, and Arnold 
Weber, an economist who recently retired as president of Northwestern 
University, are thought to be the finalists. 
</P>
<P>
 However, attorney Paul Kirk, the former Democratic national chairman, might 
not be out of the picture, and the possibility of a deadlock could result in an 
in-house compromise such as Stan Kasten of the Atlanta Braves or Paul Beeston 
or P.N.T. Widdrington of the Toronto Blue Jays. 
</P>
<P>
 A member of the search committee said some owners are still putting enormous 
pressure on Bud Selig to remain in his interim position until the most serious 
problems are resolved, but added that Selig's ongoing reluctance makes it 
probable that a commissioner will be named.  
</P>
<P>
 Said O'Malley, hot about that, too: "It shouldn't have taken a year and a half 
to identify a candidate. . . . We can't continue to be led by volunteers on a 
part-time basis. It isn't fair to the fans, players or front offices. As I've 
said, we need a strong, outside, independent commissioner in that New York 
office." 
</P>
<P>
 Independent? Fay Vincent seemed to be just that when he was forced out in 
September of 1992. Neither Schiller nor Weber is without bedfellows among the 
owners. Schiller has Olympic ties to New York Yankee owner George Steinbrenner. 
Weber appointed Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf to the Northwestern 
board of directors and is on the board of the Chicago Tribune Co., which owns 
the Cubs and TV rights to seven teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty-one votes are needed to elect a commissioner and approve a 
revenue-sharing formula. One proposal at a recent meeting in Chicago failed by 
only one vote, but a big-market coalition of eight to 10 teams doesn't appear 
to have weakened, sources said. It is made up of the Dodgers, Yankees, Blue 
Jays, New York Mets, Boston Red Sox, Colorado Rockies, St. Louis Cardinals, 
Baltimore Orioles, Florida Marlins and Texas Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 Those teams are apparently willing to pool about $50 million for a group of 
smaller-revenue teams, with the middle-market clubs neither contributing nor 
receiving, but the smaller-market clubs are believed to want a minimum of $60 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The dialogue has continued, and that's good," O'Malley said. "But it's 
mid-January and at some point, the small-market clubs have to realize there's 
only so much money to go into the pot." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley said relations are already strained but refused to identify the clubs 
he had heard were questioning motives of the big market teams. 
</P>
<P>
 A revenue-sharing formula would ultimately be the basis for a salary-cap 
proposal to the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackie Autry, executive vice president of the Angels, said she couldn't 
question the sincerity of the big-revenue teams but added, "I really have to 
wonder if we're not just spinning our wheels on this because everything I've 
read seems to indicate the union won't accept a salary cap anyway."

ANGELS SIGN GRAHE, ARE NEAR A DEAL WITH EX-RANGER LEFT-HANDER PATTERSON

 They are still not sure how they will use him, but the Angels signed reliever 
Joe Grahe to a one-year contract worth $925,000 Friday, avoiding arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also have agreed in principal on a one-year contract with 
free-agent left-hander Bob Patterson.Patterson was 2-4 with a 4.78 earned-run 
average last season with Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe, who is eligible to earn $110,000 in incentives, probably will be part 
of the bullpen-by-committee arrangement. But if the Angels sign free agent 
Gregg Olson, Grahe would become a candidate for the fifth starter's job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no problems with however they want to use me," said Grahe, who was 4-1 
with 11 saves and a 2.86 ERA last season. "Really, either way will be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Grahe, who sat out five weeks during the season because of tendinitis in his 
right rotator cuff, said he has been throwing without pain since the holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels also signed minor league reliever Ron Watson. BOB NIGHTENGALE

SUNSET LEAGUE; OCEAN VIEW ENDS OILERS' STREAK AT 22 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER BARZILAI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After trailing most of the game Friday, the Ocean View boys' basketball team 
upset visiting Huntington Beach, 51-47, ending the Oilers' Sunset League 
winning streak at 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Carney's layup gave Ocean View (9-8, 4-1 in league) its first lead, 
44-42, with just over two minutes left in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a crazy game," Ocean View Coach Jim Harris said. "(Huntington Beach) 
has had a great stretch. I remember when we had a streak of 27 wins, and it is 
really something special." 
</P>
<P>
 With 30 seconds left in the fourth quarter, Matt Malmquist brought the Oilers 
to within 48-47, but Carney converted one free throw and Tim Walsh hit two to 
give the Seahawks the four-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a very good free-throw-shooting team," Harris said. "(Huntington 
Beach) did everything right. They fouled people at the right time and just 
played real well. We were just able to get some transition buckets." 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers (10-7, 4-1 in league) took an 18-8 lead, but Ocean View closed to 
within one at halftime, 25-24, on a last-second, 10-foot shot by Kevin Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach opened the third quarter with an 11-2 run, but Carney 
followed by scoring eight of Ocean View's next 12 points to cut the lead. 
Carney finished with a game-high 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike Carney has shown a lot of heart," Harris said. "He carried us in the 
first half and then got some big buckets late in the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Huntington Beach's Tony Gonzalez, who is averaging 24.7 points, finished with 
19 points after scoring 10 in the first quarter. He also had 10 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kevin Johnson did a great job on him at the end of the game," Harris said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson finished with 12 points and Dan McDonald had 10 for Ocean View, while 
Malmquist finished with 14 points for Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Servite 62, Westminster 42 -- Kristian Vallas scored 13 points and Mark Seaton 
added 10 and 11 rebounds for host Servite (11-5, 4-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana 64, Marina 59 -- Cesar Diaz scored 18 points for Santa Ana (2-10, 
1-4). Andy Nieto scored 19 points for host Marina (7-10, 1-4). 
</P>
<P>
 Edison-Fountain Valley -- Game was postponed because no officials showed up. 
The game will be rescheduled.

EMPIRE LEAGUE; ESPERANZA GRABS ITS CHANCE IN 49-46 VICTORY OVER KATELLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mike Thimgan saw it all slipping away. The game and a chance at a 
third-consecutive Empire League championship were slipping from Esperanza's 
grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs finally tightened their grip, pulling out a 49-46 victory over 
Katella on Friday at Esperanza. They did so by putting together one good 
quarter and that was barely enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh Greer sank two free throws with 12 seconds left to give the Aztecs a 
46-45 lead and Carl Latting hit two more with two seconds left. Then came the 
sigh of relief. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had lost this one, that was it," said Thimgan, a senior guard. "We 
wouldn't win the league and if that happened . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, Thimgan doesn't know what that would mean. After all, he has played only 
on league championship teams at Esperanza. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Aztecs (12-6, 2-1) were on the verge of early elimination. They lost 
to Cypress Wednesday night, stopping their 18-game league winning streak, and 
were close to falling two games behind Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights (10-6, 1-2) led by as many as 15 points, and twice had 11-point 
leads in the third quarter. A layup by LaByron Clayton gave the Knights a 46-40 
lead with 1:56 left. It all fell apart quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore guard Carlos Romero twice missed the front end of one-and-one free 
throws. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights' defense, which had been stingy-bordering-on-brutal, suddenly 
unwound. Greer scored on a layup and Thimgan hit a three-pointer and the lead 
was one. 
</P>
<P>
 After Romero's second miss, Greer took the pass at the top of the key and 
worked his way in for a shot, but was fouled. His free throws gave the Aztecs 
their first lead of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Roditis, who led Katella with 22 points, then missed a 15-footer with six 
seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the first time we've shown that type of character," Esperanza Coach 
Mark Hill said. "We haven't been the team getting the loose balls or making the 
clutch free throws until tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, part of the evening the Aztecs did those things. The rest of the night 
belonged to Katella. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights scored the first seven points and led, 30-22, at halftime. Roditis 
had 17 points in the first half, making seven of 11 shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza didn't help itself, as the Aztecs missed their first five shots, 
three of which were layups. They also had problems dealing with Katella's 
aggressive defense, which made for a rough game. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in the third quarter, seven of the 10 players were on the floor 
scrambling for a loose ball. Katella got it. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knights controlled the third quarter, but the Aztecs stiffened. Roditis 
got little room to maneuver and missed the four shots he managed to get off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had to win this game," Thimgan said. "Everyone knew that." 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Cypress 64, Loara 59 -- Scott Davis had 27 points, including five 
three-pointers, for Cypress (11-7, 2-1). 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos 79, El Dorado 54 -- Tim Lin had 23 points, including five 
three-pointers, forsecond-ranked Los Alamitos (15-3, 3-0).

HORSE RACING / BILL CHRISTINE; MALIBU WINNER DIAZO FAVORED IN SAN FERNANDO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Trainer Mel Stute can speak from experience about how tough it is to sweep the 
three-race Strub series at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Stute went into the 1986-87 series with Snow Chief, the Preakness winner and 
champion 3-year-old colt of 1986, but he was unable to win the first two legs, 
finishing second behind Ferdinand in the Malibu Stakes and getting outrun by 
Variety Road and Broad Brush in the San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those first two races might have been too short for my horse, but then he won 
the big one," Stute said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1 1/4-mile Strub, Snow Chief beat Ferdinand by a neck for the last 
major victory of his career, with Broad Brush finishing third. 
</P>
<P>
 Those were the days. The Strub series brought together archrivals Ferdinand 
and Snow Chief, respective winners of the Kentucky Derby and Preakness, and 
when Broad Brush shipped out to California from Maryland, Santa Anita got the 
horse who had finished third in both of those races, too. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Strub series is flimsy by comparison. From a thin crop of 
3-year-olds -- Prairie Bayou, who was destroyed after being injured in the 
Belmont Stakes, probably will be voted division champion -- the seven-furlong 
Malibu on Dec. 26 had only one starter who ran in a Triple Crown race, and 
Sunday's field for the 1 1/8-mile San Fernando is not any deeper. Diazo, fifth 
in the Kentucky Derby and winner by a half-length in the Malibu, will be 
favored, and other than River Special, a leading 2-year-old in 1992, the other 
10 starters are belatedly trying to build their reputations. 
</P>
<P>
 Stute says that his Bat Eclat's chances are as good as anybody's. "I thought 
he ran a big race in the Malibu," Stute said. "He closed a lot of ground, this 
race is longer, and I think he's capable of doing a lot better." 
</P>
<P>
 Eight lengths behind and in last place after a half-mile in the Malibu, Bat 
Eclat finished fourth, beaten by less than four lengths. The 3-year-old 
gelding, a California-bred like Snow Chief, has taken a left turn under Stute, 
returning to dirt for the Strub series after a campaign last year that was 
mostly on grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Bred and owned by Robert and Barbara Walter, Bat Eclat was sent to Stute last 
fall to run on grass in the California Cup Mile. But because of a technicality 
-- he had been scratched by a veterinarian from a race at Bay Meadows the week 
before -- he was not permitted to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks after the Cal Cup, Stute ran Bat Eclat for an $80,000 claiming price 
at a mile on grass, and he won with a closing rush, paying $67.40. His time of 
1:34 was the same as Megan's Interco's winning time in the Cal Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Sticking to the turf, Bat Eclat won two allowance races before running in the 
Malibu, which was his first dirt assignment since last winter at Golden Gate 
Fields, where Noble Hay II did the training. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're excited about his chances and we'll be down for the race," Barbara 
Walter said by phone Thursday. The Walters own Vine Hill Ranch, a 550-acre 
spread 60 miles north of San Francisco, where Battonier, Bat Eclat's sire, and 
their three other stallions stand, along with dozens of broodmares. 
</P>
<P>
 The Walters bought Battonier, winner of the 1978 Illinois Derby, for $60,000 
from a Preston Madden dispersal, and from his first crop in California they got 
Charmonnier, who was 28-1 when he beat Best Pal, at 2-5, in the 1991 Cal Cup 
Classic at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Like Bat Eclat, Charmonnier is a gelding. Barbara Walter said that her 
husband, despite being a prominent breeder, still gelds many of their horses 
because he believes that there is an oversupply of stallions in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to have a lot going for you to win important races," said Robert 
Walter, who bought Vine Hill 10 years ago. "You need a superior horse, you need 
money and patience, and you've got to have all the luck in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlucky has been River Special, who won the Del Mar Futurity, the Norfolk at 
Santa Anita and the Hollywood Futurity in 1992, then was sidelined for most of 
last year, including the Triple Crown, because of a splint injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the post-position order for the San Fernando: 
</P>
<P>
 Nonproductive Asset, Nancy's French Fry, Vegieman, Goldigger's Dream, River 
Special, Bat Eclat, Diazo, Stuka, Del Mar Dennis, Pleasant Tango, Goldigger's 
Dream and Zignew. Diazo and Stuka, both owned by Allen Paulson, will run as an 
entry. Diazo will carry 120 pounds, Goldigger's Dream 118 and the rest 116. 
</P>
<P>
 Since it began in 1952, only five horses -- Round Table, Hillsdale, Ancient 
Title, Spectacular Bid and Precisionist -- have swept the Strub series. Horse 
Racing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie Belmonte is the last jockey to win the San Fernando in successive years. 
Starting in 1969, Belmonte won the stake three times in a row, counting his 
dead heat with Autobiography against Triple Bend in 1972. . . . Chris McCarron, 
who won last year's San Fernando with Bertrando, will be riding Zignew in the 
$200,000 race Sunday. . . . Bill Shoemaker, who trains Diazo, was Spectacular 
Bid's jockey when they swept the Strub series in 1980. Shoemaker rode eight San 
Fernando winners. . . . Pleasant Tango will be making his first start since a 
fifth-place finish in the Breeders' Cup Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Another race on Sunday's card is the filly division of the $100,000 California 
Breeders' Champion Stakes. At 121 pounds apiece, Dezibelle's Star and Private 
Persuasion are the highweights in the 12-horse field. . . . On Monday's Martin 
Luther King Jr. holiday, Santa Anita will run the $150,000 Santa Monica 
Handicap for fillies and mares. . . . In Santa Anita's three-race series for 
4-year-old fillies, Mamselle Bebette, who won the La Brea Stakes, will try for 
the second leg today in the El Encino. The series finale will be the La Canada 
on Feb. 5. Taisez Vous swept the races in 1978, as did Mitterand in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Peteski, the Canadian horse of the year for 1993, has been retired to stud. 
Winless in the United States, Peteski beat Kentucky Derby winner Sea Hero and 
Belmont winner Colonial Affair in the Molson Million at Woodbine. A training 
injury resulted in Peteski being scratched from the Breeders' Cup Classic at 
Santa Anita in November. . . . Several tracks, including Aqueduct, gave up to 
the winter weather Friday, and racing was also suspended on Thursday and Friday 
at Gulfstream Park, where the temperatures have been about 80 degrees. After 
one race was run Thursday, Gulfstream's jockeys voted not to ride. They said 
that the track was a muddy mess after rain earlier in the week.

 Capistrano Valley goalkeeper Jason Felix, knocked unconscious Wednesday during 
a game against Mission Viejo, has been released from Mission Regional Community 
Hospital.Felix's father, Ray, said his son has a bruised spinal cord and will 
have to wear a neck brace for six weeks. He will be out the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Felix said Jason missed Capistrano Valley's first league game because of a 
broken nose suffered Jan. 7 during a dispute on campus. "He was blindsided by 
some kid and he had to miss the game that day because he was in emergency 
getting his nose fixed," Felix said.

SEA VIEW LEAGUE GIRLS' BASKETBALL; WOODBRIDGE TAKES CARE OF BUSINESS, RANKING 
</P>

<P>
 The risk was a little higher than normal, the reward a little greater. And 
when Jamie Oenning and her teammates walked off the Newport Harbor floor Friday 
night, the anxiety that had gripped them before tip-off was let off in a stream 
of laughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-ranked Woodbridge remained one of Orange County's two unbeaten girls' 
basketball teams by scoring a business-like 52-40 Sea View League victory over 
eighth-ranked Newport Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams shared the league title last year -- each school won on the road -- 
and many expected a similar battle this season between the Warriors (16-0, 5-0) 
and Sailors (11-5, 4-1). 
</P>
<P>
 "The anxiety before the game was a little greater because there was a little 
more riding on it," admitted Oenning, who had 11 first-half points and finished 
with 13. "This team responded to that; we were able to maintain our focus and 
even raise it a notch." 
</P>
<P>
 The Warriors did against the Sailors, who were cursed by poor shooting. They 
trailed by eight before they sank their first basket after a bit more than 
three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like someone put a lid on their basket," Woodbridge Coach Eric 
Bangs said. "For 95% of the time, we did exactly what we wanted to on defense. 
I figured 50 points would win the game." 
</P>
<P>
 Fifty was more than enough. It was a 12-point game only because Genevieve 
Evarts (16 points) scored eight in the final 40 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors shot only 28% in the game, but 20% in the first three quarters and 
trailed 41-21. They were two of 11 from the floor in each of the first two 
quarters and trailed, 14-7, and 28-13. 
</P>
<P>
 "After a while," Newport Harbor Coach Shannon Jakosky said, "it was almost 
comical." 
</P>
<P>
 And it was Woodbridge that was laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 Oenning kept springing open in the first half, and in the second, Angela 
Burgess scored 11 of her 15 points to finish the job. She had nine rebounds. 
Both were six of 11 from the floor. The Warriors have five starters shooting 
more than 40% from the field for the season, and they shot 40% on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In other league games: 
</P>
<P>
 Tustin 61, Corona del Mar 41 -- Erin Oakley scored a career-high 16 points and 
Katie Scheuerman added 14 points and 12 rebounds to lead host Tustin (12-5, 
4-1). Rosalie Kane had 15 points, including two three-pointers, for Corona del 
Mar (8-7, 2-3). 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine 59, Santa Margarita 56 (OT) -- Shawnee Stevens's three-pointer with no 
time left tied the score in regulation, and teammate Jenna Vodholdt scored four 
points and grabbed two rebounds in overtime to lead visiting Irvine (8-6, 2-2). 
</P>
<P>
 Stevens finished with 21 points, including three three-pointers, and Melinda 
Newe added 12 points and four assists for Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 University 60, Saddleback 54 -- Jennifer Stanley had 29 points for University 
(9-4, 3-2), which struggled without leading rebounder Pamela Loud (knee 
injury). Nicole Wiora had 20 points, including three three-pointers, for 
Saddleback (4-9, 0-5).

GIRLS' BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; RANCHO ALAMITOS BEATS KENNEDY DESPITE FRANK'S INJURY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos roared to an 11-1 lead before host Kennedy could get off a 
shot, but Vaquero Coach Peter Pyle looked worried. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting on the bench was forward Michelle Frank, the team's second-leading 
scorer, who was hobbling after injuring her ankle only 49 seconds into the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank could not even join the team in the locker room at halftime, but the 
injury was noticeably improved by the end of the game which Rancho Alamitos 
won, 60-45, to improve its Garden Grove League winning streak to 42. 
</P>
<P>
 "She might have been more scared than anything else," Pyle said. "She felt 
that she could come back in the fourth quarter. We'll know for sure how serious 
it is tomorrow (Saturday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy pulled it to 42-38 with 6:10 left in the game, but Rancho Alamitos 
survived. Jamie Franklin bounced a pass to Sally Vasquez for an easy layup and 
Detra Vickers followed with a basket and Akilah Rodgers connected on a 
three-point field goal to put the game out of reach, 49-38. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Neuman opened the game with a three-point field goal on Rancho Alamitos' 
first possession and Rodgers followed with a field goal for a 5-0 lead before 
Frank was hurt. Rancho Alamitos built up a 17-7 lead after the first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers, with a pair of three-pointers in the fourth quarter, paced Rancho 
Alamitos with 26 points. Karin Kitagawa had 14 and Leslie Prochasha added 12 
for the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Alamitos used a strong defense, forcing 16 first-half turnovers to take 
a 29-21 lead. But the Irish bounced back to 31-27 in the third quarter. MIKE

 When Todd Steussie and Jamal Anderson were embarking on their college football 
careers four years ago, they dreamed of becoming the best. And they wondered 
what life would be like if they reached that level. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't have to wonder anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 Steussie and Anderson will play today in a prestigious college all-star event 
-- the 69th East-West Shrine game in Palo Alto. Surprisingly, both approach 
this game with guarded enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing hotel space for one week with the nation's best Saturday players is 
cause for celebration, but Anderson and Steussie say they must temper their 
jubilation. There's tension in Palo Alto and the players feel it. 
</P>
<P>
 This might be nothing more than an exhibition game, but professional careers 
and hundreds of thousands of dollars could hang in the balance. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't come in here looking to have a good time because there's too much 
pressure," said Steussie, a tackle at California who played at Agoura High. 
"Your livelihood and a considerable amount of money are at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 Steussie, a 6-foot-6, 300-pound four-year starter at Cal, was projected to be 
an All-American before the season. He justified the billing as a second-team 
pick on the Associated Press All-American team. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson's path to Palo Alto was far different. The 6-0, 244-pound Utah 
fullback who played at El Camino Real High was one of four running backs the 
Utes planned to use at the start of the season. But his stock increased late in 
the season when Utah switched to a one-back offense and Anderson produced 158-, 
145- and 146-yard rushing games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an honor being here," Anderson said. "You're with the top players in the 
nation. But it's like a tryout. There's a lot of coaches and general managers 
talking to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay, New Orleans and Kansas City appear to be the most interested in 
Anderson, who added luster to his portfolio by gaining 135 combined yards and 
scoring on a 35-yard run in Utah's 28-21 loss to USC in the Freedom Bowl. He 
also led all Ute receivers in the game with seven receptions for 61 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson wants to have a big game, if for no other reason than to erase the 
bitter aftertaste of the loss to USC, in which Utah spotted the Trojans a 28-0 
lead. He still wants to prove something to three Trojans -- Willie McGinest, 
Bradford Banta and Jason Sehorn -- who will be his West teammates today. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to play well, if for no other reason to shut their mouths," Anderson 
said. "Of course, none of them touched me in the Freedom Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's only two fullbacks here, so I'm sure I'll be playing a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, who finished with 1,032 yards rushing, 244 receiving and 15 
touchdowns, said he's not surprised to be closing out his career in an all-star 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to Utah for a reason -- to have a lot of success," he said. "Not just 
to hang out. Things are building for me now. I've opened a lot of eyes." 
</P>
<P>
 Steussie, expected to be a high draft pick, didn't go to Cal with lofty 
expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't get invited to the (North-South) Shrine game out of high school. I 
wasn't seen as a high-impact player," he said. "Plus, I wasn't one of the 
biggest guys in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 When Steussie entered Cal as a 6-foot-6, 240-pound freshman, bulkier, veteran 
linemen intimidated him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a culture shock as a freshman, seeing a bunch of guys with goatees 
when I barely had two hairs on my chin," Steussie said. "But everything worked 
out nicely." 
</P>
<P>
 Steussie, who redshirted his first year, started training hard in the weight 
room and has since become a strongman of note. He bench-presses 465 pounds and 
squat lifts 600. He has 10% body fat and sports a goatee. 
</P>
<P>
 Steussie and Anderson have become impressive specimens for NFL scouts. Much of 
Anderson's bulk is in his legs, which tacklers have trouble wrapping up. 
</P>
<P>
 And now he's ready for the next step. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love pressure," Anderson said. "I'm not worried at all. I'm definitely 
excited. Everything is happening that I've planned in my head. I had success at 
El Camino Real and Moorpark (College). And now here."

VENTURA COACHES HAD GUARD DOWN AS RAMIREZ MADE POINT RIGHT AWAY; JUST OUT OF 
HIGH SCHOOL, HE TOOK CHARGE OF PIRATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FERNANDO DOMINGUEZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It wasn't supposed to work so well so fast for Joey Ramirez on the Ventura 
College men's basketball team. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura coaches, men in the business of running a first-rate program by 
recruiting outstanding players, knew Ramirez was good but needed to smooth some 
rough edges to become a top junior college point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 They figured he would sit on the bench last season, his first with the 
Pirates, and learn by watching the projected starter at the position, Donyhel 
Johnson. Even one of Ramirez's uncles tried to convince him to go elsewhere, 
saying he would be relegated to mop-up detail. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about misreading a guy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We initially thought he'd come in and back up some people, develop as a point 
guard, and then play," said Virgil Watson, the Ventura assistant who recruited 
Ramirez from Santa Paula High. "What surprised us is how fast he developed. He 
took on all challengers." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez wasn't exactly a stranger to the Ventura staff. He had attended 
several basketball camps run by Pirate Coach Philip Mathews. But even Mathews 
wasn't prepared for what Ramirez showed him right out of the blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just blew (the other point guards) away," Mathews said. "There was never a 
word of complaint from Dony. Joey just took the job away. It's that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ramirez: "I hate sitting on the bench, so I tried as hard as I could." 
</P>
<P>
 There wasn't much Johnson, now playing at Langston University in Oklahoma, 
could dispute. With Ramirez running the floor, the Pirates are a precision 
machine. 
</P>
<P>
 The 5-foot-10 sophomore with explosive quickness and an accurate three-point 
shot is the team's catalyst. He averages 15.0 points and six assists and has 
made 83.6% (102 of 122) of his free throws and was named the most valuable 
player in two of the five tournaments in which Ventura played -- and won -- 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, he averaged 11.0 points and 4.8 assists during the regular 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the true measure of his value to the squad is the leadership he 
provides. With him in the lineup, the Pirates are 55-3 the past two seasons and 
reached the state championship game last March before being upset by Columbia, 
97-88, in the title game at the University of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 He also helped Ventura reel off 21 consecutive victories at the start of last 
season, a school record the current team continues to improve on with every 
game. The Pirates (23-1, 5-0 in Western State Conference play), the state's 
top-rated team, try for their 24th consecutive victory tonight against 
Bakersfield at home. 
</P>
<P>
 The pressure for making the Ventura offense click without the scoring threats 
featured on last season's team hasn't slowed Ramirez. He knows that taking care 
of the ball and shadowing an opponent on defense all over the court won't be 
sufficient anymore. The Pirates need him to shoot -- and often -- to complement 
forward Brandon Jessie, the team's primary scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura could live without Ramirez's scoring last season. Forward Calvin 
Curry, now at Oklahoma, could score from anywhere on the floor and generally 
did, averaging 21.1 points during the regular season. Guard Stephane Brown, now 
at Oregon State, averaged 12.6 points. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirate arsenal is not as deep this season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot more demanding for me this season," Ramirez said. "Last (season) I 
had Stephane (Brown, now at Oregon State) in the backcourt with me. But now I 
have to look more for my shot. It doesn't bother me, though. I'll shoot it." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he can't find the range sometimes. Until he pumped in 20 points in a 
76-62 conference victory over Canyons on Thursday night, Ramirez had struggled 
with his shooting lately, making only five of 29 shots the previous two 
outings, but still making enough free throws to score in double figures each 
time. Yet, it was a given his shot wouldn't stay as quiet as he does on the 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez is the antithesis of the brash, loud-mouth guy who tries to harass his 
opponent with verbal jabs. In fact, he can't even see the point of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really like to talk trash," he said. "As far as I'm concerned, they 
are only talking to themselves. Sometimes when they talk, it doesn't even make 
sense." 
</P>
<P>
 That quiet, almost shy demeanor on the court, Mathews says, doesn't carry over 
to Ramirez's shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has never been bashful about shooting the ball," Mathews said. "I tell him 
not to let (missed shots) become a psychological thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez never had time to concern himself with that at Santa Paula. There, 
whether he shot blanks or hit nothing but net, he was forced to shoot. The 
Cardinals were perennial doormats in the Frontier League until Ramirez and 
Terry Bell, now a teammate at Ventura, made them contenders in the 1990-91 and 
'91-92 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 In his junior season at Santa Paula, Ramirez averaged 23.2 points and 5.9 
assists to lead the Cardinals to second place in the league behind Santa Clara. 
He averaged 22.2 points, seven assists and three steals the following season as 
Santa Paula again finished second to the Saints. 
</P>
<P>
 "At Santa Paula, I shot about 20-25 times a game," Ramirez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardinal Coach Tom Donahue says that was sheer necessity. Ramirez was the best 
player he inherited when he took over the program in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went to see him play in an adult league and I remember telling my wife, 
'(Ramirez) is for real,' " said Donahue, who occasionally plays tennis with 
Ramirez and talks to him frequently on the phone. "I was so impressed with his 
quickness and his range and his tenacity. I had to tone him down in practice 
sometimes. He would go all-out all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez always gives it the extra effort. An accounting major with ambitions 
of transferring to a Division I school -- Pepperdine and Cal State Fullerton 
are among those recruiting him -- Ramirez is motivated by the forces that 
influence his life. In basketball, that's Mathews and the other Ventura 
coaches. Away from the court, his parents Rudy and Tana have left their mark. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see school as another challenge," Ramirez said. "My parents have always 
pushed me. I've always wanted to do well for everything they have done for me." 
</P>
<P>
 They attend all of his games. And not just his parents, but many other family 
members and friends who live in Santa Paula or the Ventura area. 
</P>
<P>
 "His great-grandmother, who is 83 years old, goes to all the games," Tana 
Ramirez said. "His sister (Janis) also goes and takes Lindsey (his 1 
1/2-year-old niece). A bunch of us went to San Francisco (for the state 
championships). . . . It's real special. He has worked real hard to get to this 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 Mathews, Watson -- and especially Donyhel Johnson -- realized that long ago.

RIO MESA'S REARDON QUITS AFTER 26 YEARS AS FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 John Reardon, Ventura County's winningest football coach, officially announced 
his retirement Friday as the Rio Mesa High football coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Football has been very good to me and it's been a great career, but it's time 
to move on," he said. "When it's the right time, no one has to tell you." 
</P>
<P>
 Reardon, 59, will retain his position as chairman of the school's physical 
education department until his retirement from teaching in June of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way to measure the importance of John Reardon to Rio Mesa High 
School or the impact that his absence will have," said Athletic Director Brian 
FitzGerald, who is among the more than 1,000 players Reardon has coached. 
"People need to know that he was much more than just our football coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Reardon, who became the varsity coach in 1967, had a record of 154-119-4 in 26 
seasons. He guided Rio Mesa to a section championship in 1971 with a 28-20 
victory over Paso Robles. Rio Mesa lost to Atascadero, 20-14, in a 1983 section 
title game. The Spartans also were section semifinalists in 1973, '77, '79 and 
'82. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Reardon, Rio Mesa won 10 league titles and advanced to the section 
playoffs 13 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Before last season, Reardon intimated he might retire from coaching. The 
Spartans finished 6-4, 3-4 in Channel League play, failing to qualify for the 
Division III playoffs for the second consecutive season. 
</P>
<P>
 Reardon's successor has not been chosen. The position is open only to 
employees within the Oxnard Union High School District, FitzGerald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rio Mesa administrators indicated that Reardon will be involved in the 
selection process. He said he will make a recommendation, but declined to name 
the person. 
</P>
<P>
 "That wouldn't be fair of me," Reardon said. "I'll make my suggestion, but 
(the decision) is strictly up to the administration." 
</P>
<P>
 Spartan assistant George Contreras is a leading candidate for the position. 
Contreras, who previously coached at Westlake, has been on Reardon's staff for 
five seasons.

WSC PUTTING HANCOCK BACK ON ITS ROAD MAP; JUNIOR COLLEGES: SANTA MARIA SCHOOL 
WILL REJOIN CONFERENCE IN THE FALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Western State Conference apparently will regain one of its athletic 
members when Hancock College of Santa Maria joins the conference starting with 
the 1994-95 school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Rilliet, commissioner of athletics for the Community College League of 
California, said the Commission on Athletics will hear a recommendation next 
Friday from its conference committee that Hancock be readmitted into the WSC, 
effective in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to tell what the commission will decide (officially), but Hancock 
probably will be placed in the Western State Conference," Rilliet said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aviva Kamin, the WSC commissioner, said the recommendation will amount to 
nothing more than a formality. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point, it's a pretty acceptable fact they (Hancock) will be placed in 
our conference," Kamin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allowing Hancock into the WSC, however, was not what the conference schools 
wanted because of travel expenses, Kamin said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We voted in a meeting in November, when they (Hancock) applied to join, not 
to put them in the conference," Kamin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rilliet noted, however, that WSC schools travel north of Santa Maria to play 
conference games at Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 The move was requested by Hancock officials because the Coast Valley 
Conference, in which the Bulldogs have competed since 1988 in several sports 
except football and soccer, will be disbanded after the current school year. 
Hancock, a WSC member from 1972 to 1988, played football in the Coast 
Conference and soccer in the WSC. 
</P>
<P>
 Rilliet said a new conference called the Central California Conference will be 
formed with nine schools that are members of other conferences. The geographic 
stretch of the CCC will run from Columbia College -- about 50 miles east of 
Stockton -- in the north to Taft College at its southernmost edge. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Osborne, Hancock's athletic director, said those traveling distances 
were economically prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be too expensive for us because we would have to stay overnight if 
we played in some of those places," Osborne said. "Merced is about 4 1/2 hours 
away and Modesto is about 5 1/2 probably. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where we are located, there are only three leagues that would be viable. One 
is the new league, the other is the Coast Conference, which would have been 
worse as far as cost, and the other choice was the WSC." 
</P>
<P>
 All 11 schools in the Coast Conference are in the San Francisco and San Jose 
areas.

COLLEGE NOTEBOOK: FOR SOME FOLKS, WSC STANDINGS DON'T ADD UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Confused about how the Western State Conference keeps its men's basketball 
standings? Join the club. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the third season the 11-team conference, split into North (five teams) 
and South (six) divisions, will count only intradivisional games in the 
official standings. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current format, teams play schools in the other division once and teams 
in their own division twice in a home-and-away setup. All interdivisional games 
essentially are considered nonconference games, even though they are played 
under the conference umbrella, and have a bearing only for seeding purposes in 
the Southern California regionals. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement has the blessing of the Community College League of 
California, the state's governing body for junior college athletics. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds too strange? It does even to the conference coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is confusing," said Brian Beauchemin, Glendale coach. 
</P>
<P>
 But the coaches say they adopted the plan for several reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Part of the rationale for the change was that we have 11 teams. In order to 
play each other twice, that means we would have to start conference play in 
December," said Al Nordquist, Moorpark coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason, Canyons Coach Lee Smelser said, was to get more conference 
teams into the regionals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had the same entries as a six-team conference," Smelser said. "We thought 
we could get better representation." 
</P>
<P>
 Beauchemin mentioned yet another reason to support the present format. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you play a team from the other division only once, especially on the 
road, it's not a viable measure (of the teams' strengths) because you don't get 
to play (that team) again." 
</P>
<P>
 The attempt to place more teams in the regionals didn't fully materialize last 
season, however. Only four from the WSC -- Canyons, Glendale, Moorpark and 
Ventura -- made it to the 32-team tournament. JUNIOR COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Calendar-Watching 
</P>
<P>
 Beauchemin is counting the days until two of the best players on the Glendale 
basketball team, forward Michael Wright and point guard Maurice Sowells, return 
from injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros could certainly use them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's killing us depth-wise not to have them," Beauchemin said. "Our guys are 
getting dead tired in the second half (of games)." 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale (9-9, 1-3 in Western State Conference play) has dropped three 
consecutive games. The Vaqueros started the season with five victories in six 
games and won their first conference interdivisional game Jan. 4 against 
Cuesta, 76-57. The Cougars were ranked eighth in the state at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 The game at Cuesta marked the return of Wright from a preseason knee injury 
and things looked promising for the Vaqueros, especially when the 6-foot-5 
freshman scored 16 points and grabbed 11 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 But two nights later, Wright and Sowells went down with ankle injuries in an 
82-77 overtime loss at Oxnard. Beauchemin hopes they will return next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are our best athletes, those two," he said. CAL LUTHERAN 
</P>
<P>
 Shooting Stars 
</P>
<P>
 Although Kingsmen basketball Coach Mike Dunlap has taken great satisfaction in 
his team's 12-game winning streak to start the season entering tonight's 
Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference game at Redlands, he 
admitted that he never envisioned it at the start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap expected Cal Lutheran's defense to be tenacious and the Kingsmen have 
not let him down, limiting opponents to 44.4% shooting from the field and 
forcing an average of 20 turnovers. But he had not counted on his offense 
hitting 52.8% of its shots, including 47.6% from three-point range. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't expect us to have this kind of a shooting percentage at the start of 
the season. But I think we've benefited by taking an awful lot of shots in 
practice each day," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Each Cal Lutheran player typically makes 350-400 baskets a day in practice, 
according to Dunlap. 
</P>
<P>
 The players usually attempt 180-200 shots in various drills during daytime 
practice before returning in the evening to shoot under the supervision of 
Dunlap or one of his assistants. 
</P>
<P>
 During the practice drills, the team is often split into six two-man units in 
which one player positions himself on a certain part of the floor as another 
shoots over him. The team that makes the desired amount of shots first in a 
five-minute time period gets a brief rest as the others do pushups or some type 
of running drill. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pushups and running do not amount to much on an individual basis," 
Dunlap. "It's just enough to sting the guys and make them want to win the next 
drill." CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE 
</P>
<P>
 Yard Expected to Play 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Yard, the top scorer and rebounder on the Cal State Northridge 
basketball team, has resumed practice on a limited basis this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Yard suffered an injury to his right knee in the first half of a game at UC 
Irvine last Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 Northridge has three games next week, beginning Monday at Colorado, and Yard 
is expected to be ready.  
</P>
<P>
 Yard, a 6-6 forward, is averaging 13.2 points and 6.4 rebounds. Around the 
Campuses . . . 
</P>
<P>
 * The Master's men's basketball team tied a season high with 10 three-point 
baskets in Thursday's 112-76 victory over visiting Point Loma Nazarene. The 
Mustangs, who made 10 of 22 attempts against the Crusaders, were 10 for 21 from 
three-point range in a 127-34 season-opening victory over L.I.F.E. Bible. 
</P>
<P>
 * With 15 rebounds against Point Loma, Master's center Emeka Okenwa has had 
double-digit rebounding totals in 12 of the Mustangs' 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cal Lutheran forward Paul LaMott made six of nine shots from the field 
against Occidental on Wednesday and his shooting percentage dropped to 68.9%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cal Lutheran guard Paul Tapp continues to shoot better from outside the 
three-point line than inside it. Tapp, who is averaging 12.4 points, has hit 
56.3% (36 of 64) of his three-point shots, but only 40.6% (13 for 32) of his 
two-point attempts.

CHAPMAN BOUNCES BACK TO BEAT UC SANTA CRUZ 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chapman, taking an opportunity to help itself, defeated UC Santa Cruz, 95-68, 
in a men's basketball game Friday night at the Hutton Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, the Panthers absorbed an 18-point beating by UC San Diego and Coach 
Mike Bokosky was concerned that the defense was a step slow, a fatal mistake 
against one of the better NCAA Division III teams in the West. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Cruz (3-12) doesn't have the same credentials, but Bokosky said that 
wasn't an issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were mainly concerned about ourselves tonight," he said. "We wanted to 
re-establish our effort, which we lacked against San Diego." 
</P>
<P>
 Bokosky used nearly his entire roster -- all but two of the 15-man team got 
into the game in the first half -- and the Panthers (9-5) took a 10-3 lead in 
the first three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Chapman led by as many as 17 points and settled for a 15-point halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Banana Slugs had bigger inside players, such as 6-foot-8 John Wooley, 6-7 
David Goldberg and 6-5 Jason Leiner, but the quicker Panthers were able to 
control the tempo. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the second half, however, Chapman bogged down. The Panthers' pressure 
defense was giving up too many easy baskets and Santa Cruz cut the lead to 
eight points, 62-54, with 11 minutes 29 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 But Chapman's Stefan Mumaw scored five consecutive points to spark a 12-2 run 
that put the game out of reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Mumaw and Aaron Cornell each scored 14 points, leading five Panthers in double 
figures. Greg Reynolds scored 13, Anthony Gonzales 12 and Adam Dzierzynski 11. 
Gonzales and Cornell each made four three-pointers and Reynolds made three. 
</P>
<P>
 The Panthers made 11 of 24 three-pointers (45.8%) and shot 54.5% from the 
field (36 for 66).

ON THE BEACH / MIKE REILLEY: SURF TOUR RETURNING TO HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Although the Assn. of Surfing Professionals has added a Southern California 
event to its 1994 schedule, it won't be the Op Pro, which is entering its 13th 
year at the Huntington Beach Pier. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the $130,000 U.S. Open of Surfing, scheduled Aug. 2-7 at the 
Huntington Beach Pier, will become the focal point of Southern California 
surfing scene. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the first world tour event on the U.S. mainland since the Op Pro dropped 
off the tour in 1991 for financial reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 The Op Pro, which continued the last two years as a team and qualifying event, 
is scheduled July 27-31 at the pier. It will feature men's, women's, 
longboarding and junior amateur divisions, but will serve only as a qualifying 
event for the U.S. Open and the world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 The ASP formally sanctioned the U.S. Open at its winter meetings in late 
December. The contest is organized by Prime Ticket event properties, part of 
the Prime Ticket sports television network. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Open's $130,000 purse meets the minimum required by the ASP for a 
world-tour event. The men's division offers $105,000 in prize money, and the 
women will compete for a $25,000 purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Meek, vice president of event properties for Prime Ticket, said the 
contest will include divisions for longboarding and bodyboarding, as well as 
jet-ski and lifeguard exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Open also will charge for grandstand seating in a U-shaped, 
7,500-seat arena. Meek said Huntington Beach city officials gave the contest 
permission to charge for seating, similar to the way the Assn. of Volleyball 
Professionals' beach tour did at last summer's Seal Beach tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be a modest price," Meek said. "Something like $5 a day or $12 for a 
three-day pass. There will still be free seating on the beach." 
</P>
<P>
 Other ideas in the works include: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Installation of 50 to 80 exposition booths behind the stadium for surfboard 
shapers, clothing companies and other surfing businesses to showcase their 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Big-screen televisions near the pier to show replays and scores. 
</P>
<P>
 -- An Aug. 4 fund-raiser for the Surfrider Foundation at Newport Beach's Hard 
Rock Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Meek said contest officials are negotiating with the city for permits allowing 
acoustic bands to play on a stage near the surfing venue for the final three 
days of the contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The bands could raise some concern about security among city officials, who 
have carefully monitored permits for beach events since the riot at the 1986 Op 
Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be no rock bands," Meek said. "We certainly do not want anything 
that will start any trouble. Our goal is to make it a great surfing event." 
</P>
<P>
 Prime Ticket's contest comes at a difficult time for pro surfing and the 
surfwear industry. Surfing interest in the United States has declined the last 
two years, and events in Santa Cruz and Oceanside dropped off the world tour 
along with the Op Pro. 
</P>
<P>
 The Op had been part of the world tour for 10 years, but switched to an 
international team format in 1992 after falling $40,000 shy of the $125,000 
minimum purse required for an ASP individual championship event. The change 
came at a difficult time for Op, which began reorganizing in May 1992 after 
filing for protection from creditors. 
</P>
<P>
 The surfwear company also moved the contest from its traditional late July 
date to the late June schedule in 1992. But the Op returned to the individual 
championships last summer as a qualifying event for the world tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Estimated crowds of 20,000 watched the finals the past two years, about half 
of some of the estimated crowds in the mid- and late 1980s, when the sport's 
popularity was at its peak. 
</P>
<P>
 Meek said the "timing is perfect" for a major surfing event in Southern 
California. Coca-Cola has taken over sponsorship of the world tour, the first 
mainstream company to do so, and participation in beach sports is on the 
increase, Meek said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're ready to see a renaissance in surfing," he said. "If you track the sale 
of longboards and bodyboards, you'll see that the young and old are getting 
involved in the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are coming back to the beach lifestyle. Look at success of the pro 
beach volleyball tour." 
</P>

MIGHTY DUCK NOTEBOOK / ROBYN NORWOOD; FERREIRA'S GAME STRATEGY STRESSES PLAYING 
FOR KEEPS, NOT TRADES

 General Manager Jack Ferreira has answered to nicknames ranging from Race Car 
to Quacker Jack, but one thing you wouldn't call him based on this season is 
Trader Jack. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks have not made a trade since the season began. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Panthers have made 11 -- the most in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 One first-year team trades left and right, the other listens to offers and 
says, "No thanks." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know you got points for making trades," Ferreira quipped. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy Carson, a former 50-goal scorer, was on the trading block for months. 
The Ducks weren't interested. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Kudelski scored 26 goals for a terrible Ottawa team, and the rival 
Panthers grabbed him in a trade while the Ducks stood pat. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the Ducks lost leading scorer Anatoli Semenov for two months with a 
dislocated left elbow, Ferreira didn't deal. 
</P>
<P>
 What gives? 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, Ferreira is intent on sticking to the long-term plan, being 
patient and not trading away valuable draft picks or disturbing the team's good 
chemistry and success. 
</P>
<P>
 For another, Paul Kariya is on his way. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every situation is different," said Ferreira, who made close to 30 trades in 
his first year as general manager in Minnesota, in 1988. "I think some of the 
answers for our franchise are within our organization but aren't signed. I not 
only look at the immediate situation, but long range. Sure, we may have been 
able to make a trade that would help temporarily but would really clog up the 
situation maybe a month from now. I've backed off doing some things for that 
reason." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks need to add more offense and a quarterback for their weak power 
play. Kariya, the Maine star who says he wants to play hockey like Magic 
Johnson played basketball, might join the Ducks after he plays for Canada in 
the Olympics next month -- if the Ducks can persuade him to sign now instead of 
returning to school for the rest of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 So say that after the injury to Semenov, the Ducks had traded for Carson, 
taking on a big salary and perhaps parting with a big physical forward. By 
March, with Semenov back and Kariya potentially in the fold, they would have 
too many centers competing for ice time, Ferreira figures. 
</P>
<P>
 So by the time you throw money into the mix -- it won't be cheap to sign 
Kariya or next year's No. 2 overall pick -- and the fact that the Ducks don't 
have much to offer in trade, and you begin to see why Ferreira hasn't made a 
deal since last summer, when he traded a third-round draft pick to Montreal for 
Todd Ewen and Patrik Carnback. 
</P>
<P>
 "In almost every instance, certain guys I don't want to give up are the ones 
other teams want," Ferreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely, that's a Ewen or a Stu Grimson. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're looking for power forwards, guys with size and presence," Ferreira 
said. "Obviously, I could have made three or four of those type trades, but a 
year from now, I'd be looking for a guy like that." 
</P>
<P>
 What happens if the Ducks are really in the playoff hunt come late February? 
The thought already has crossed Coach Ron Wilson's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the end of February or early March, if we feel we've got a realistic 
chance to make the playoffs, we might be looking for a quarterback for our 
power play," Wilson said. "But you don't want to compromise yourself two or 
three years down the road. We certainly don't have a legitimate chance of 
winning the Stanley Cup. Teams that feel they do might make a lot of moves. 
We'll see where we are. But to get things, you've got to give up things. People 
aren't going to be asking for third- and fourth-liners." 
</P>
<P>

 Kariya Watch: Is he ready for the NHL? You be the judge. In his first 17 games 
with the Canadian Olympic team, Kariya has 29 points -- four goals and 25 
assists -- and is playing on a line with former NHL players Petr Nedved and 
Chris Kontos.

 Newest Duck: Defenseman Don McSween, who signed a one-year contract this week 
with the defense corps thinned by injury was the defense partner of Duck 
teammate Bill Houlder last season in San Diego. McSween, 29, hadn't appeared in 
an NHL game in four years before Wednesday's game against San Jose. 
</P>
<P>
 In college, he played on the 1986 NCAA Division I championship team at 
Michigan State that included NHL players Mike Donnelly (Kings), Kevin Miller 
(Blues), Bob Essensa (Jets) and Joe Murphy (Blackhawks).

DUCKS DO SOME ROAD WORK AT HOME; HOCKEY: FOR A CHANGE, TEAM SHOWS THE STYLE AT 
ANAHEIM ARENA THAT HAS HELPED IT WIN OUT OF TOWN. 
</P>

 Just another game, Terry Yake said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 But it couldn't have been, not with so much at stake as the Mighty Ducks faced 
off against the Hartford Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford was Yake's old team, the one that left him unprotected in the 
expansion draft last June, the one he said he looked for first when the NHL 
schedule was released. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweet revenge? Perhaps that was in the back of Yake's mind. But he said his 
only thoughts were of winning and halting the Ducks' disappointing play at 
Anaheim Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks went into Friday's game with the second-worst home record in the 
league, a 5-14-2 mark that included a neutral-ice victory against Dallas at 
Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 Yake and the Ducks left Anaheim Arena winners for the first time since a Dec. 
12 victory against St. Louis. He played on a line with Patrik Carnback and Tim 
Sweeney that accounted for four goals and two assists in a 6-3 victory over the 
Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a road game for us to the T," said Yake, who had one assist. 
</P>
<P>
 Meaning? 
</P>
<P>
 "Tight-checking, good saves by our goalies, score when we have to, take 
advantage of mistakes," Yake explained. "It's got to be our style." 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks, 12-12-0 on the road, had seemed to chuck that grinding, 
opportunistic style at home in favor of a less patient, more wide-open game and 
they paid the price. 
</P>
<P>
 After Wednesday's 5-2 loss to San Jose, the Ducks met to discuss their home 
woes. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Yake said they tuned out all the distractions they believe have kept 
their minds from the business at hand. They ignored people walking through the 
dressing room. They turned off the stereo and the television 30 minutes earlier 
than normal and talked about the Whalers. 
</P>
<P>
 Yake no doubt provided a wealth of information. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a bit of an advantage because I knew all the strengths of the players 
on the other team," said Yake, who scored 22 goals for Hartford last season. 
</P>
<P>
 All that meant little when the Whalers took a 3-0 lead 3:58 into the second 
period and the Ducks appeared headed for a fifth consecutive home loss.  
</P>
<P>
 But Carnback got the Ducks turned around with a goal at the 10:47 mark of the 
second. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that first goal was the exact turning point, but it was a 
relief," Yake said. "(Bob) Corkum scored that short-handed goal right after 
that and everybody said, 'OK, we're right back in the game.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Sooner or later we were going to get chances to win the game and we did the 
last 45-50 minutes. Usually, it takes 60 minutes of good hockey to win. 
Fortunately, we got away with only 50 tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 At least it was a step in the right direction, a game to remember when they 
stray too far from their disciplined style of play.

 Stock price -- A story Dec. 18 about Reynolds Kendrick & Stratton, a Beverly 
Hills stock brokerage, did not fully state the details of trading in Hariston 
Corp., a Canadian company in which Reynolds Kendrick is a market-maker. As 
reported, Hariston shares, which closed at $11 on Dec. 17, traded as low as 62 
cents in 1992. But taking into account a later reverse 5-for-1 stock split, the 
low should have been reported as $3.10 a share.

 AT&T Move Creates Fourth-Quarter Loss: New York-based AT&T said it will set 
aside $1.3 billion to comply with new accounting rules that chiefly cover how 
severance payments are reflected on a company's books.The move will reduce 
AT&T's fourth-quarter earnings after taxes by about 96 cents a share, resulting 
in a loss. Without it, the company said it would have earned $1.15 billion, or 
85 cents a share, which would be in line with analysts' expectations. In 
addition to the accounting charges, AT&T said its 1993 results will also 
reflect about $120 million in costs associated with restructuring NCR Corp., 
its computer manufacturing subsidiary. NCR last fall offered early retirement 
incentives to 5,000 of its 27,000 employees.

 13,000 Forgo Prudential Settlement: On the eve of today's deadline, more than 
13,000 investors have chosen not to participate in a revised settlement of a 
class-action lawsuit over Prudential Securities' troubled oil and gas 
partnerships.That is about 1,000 more investors than opted out of a much 
smaller settlement nearly a year ago. The first offer -- of $37 million in cash 
-- was derailed last February by a federal judge. The new offer involves a 
maximum of $120 million in cash for the roughly 130,000 investors in 
Prudential's Energy Income Funds.

NHL ROUNDUP; COFFEY GETS HIS 900TH ASSIST, RED WINGS WIN AGAIN, 9-3 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Defenseman Paul Coffey had four assists, including the 900th of his career, 
and Sergei Fedorov and Vyacheslav Kozlov had two goals and two assists each to 
lead the Detroit Red Wings to a 9-3 rout of the Dallas Stars at Detroit on 
Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Coffey, who played with Edmonton, Pittsburgh and the Kings before going to 
Detroit, became only the sixth player in NHL history and the first defenseman 
to reach the 900-assist level. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Wings are 12-2-2 in their last 16 games, and 9-1-1 in their last 11 at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 The teams alternated goals through the first period, before Detroit took 
control in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Islanders 5, Montreal 2 -- Brad Dalgarno scored twice and Ron Hextall 
ended a personal five-game losing streak by stopping 35 shots at Uniondale, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 The Islanders, amid an up-and-down season, continued their mastery over 
Montreal, winning their third consecutive meeting this season. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 5, Washington 2 -- The Devils attained a measure of revenge against 
Washington goaltender Rick Tabaracci, who had shut them out five days earlier, 
chasing him from the net in the second period at Landover, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Stevens had two goals and Martin Brodeur stopped 30 shots for the 
Devils. 
</P>
<P>
 New York Rangers 5, Philadelphia 2 -- Adam Graves and Mike Gartner scored 
goals in the first 5:04 and Mike Richter made 22 saves to lead the Rangers at 
New York. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rangers ended a three-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Brent Fedyk scored twice for the Flyers, who had been 5-0-1 against their 
Atlantic Division rivals since a 3-1 loss at Madison Square Garden on Nov. 4, 
1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 2, Ottawa 2 -- Sylvain Turgeon scored a power-play goal for the 
Senators at 13:53 of the second period to force a tie at Vancouver. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver outshot Ottawa, 24-8, in the third period and overtime, but goalie 
Darrin Madeley denied them.

<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than a decade of bonehead decisions made under Georgia Frontiere's 
reign, we have a team that reflects to a T her ineptness as an owner and a 
human being -- little heart, no character and a propensity to adopt her 
lifelong philosophy: When the going gets tough, escape to greener pastures. 
Good riddance.

 I find it interesting that the Rams wish to explore the economic viability of 
remaining in Anaheim because more-recently designed stadiums provide better 
revenue prospects than Anaheim Stadium. Do you want to run that by me again? 
</P>
<P>
 After four consecutive losing seasons, we are told that the problem with low 
attendance is the stadium? With reasoning like that, I think I know why the

VIEWPOINT / LETTERS; THE ABSOLUTE FINISH TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is USC fan Ron Van Meter serious? In his letter to The Times (Jan. 8) he 
labels Notre Dame's finishing as the second-best college football team in the 
nation "the most perfect kind of pain that could be inflicted upon Notre Dame's 
alumni and fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's my definition of painful.It's when your college football team: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Loses its season opener by 22 points to a team that loses to the national 
champion by 26 points. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Has a two-year 1-1 bowl record against powerhouses Utah and Fresno State. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Has an 0-11 record against Notre Dame since 1983.

 In the Jan. 8 Viewpoint, Ken Williston is obviously upset about what he feels 
was unfair treatment at the hands of Wisconsin fans in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, Mr. Williston has not been paying much attention to the actions of 
his fellow Bruins during the past 10 years. When it comes to obscene gestures, 
comments and throwing objects, UCLA has been very creative. It seems the Bruin 
faithful have gotten a taste of their own medicine and don't like it.

VIEWPOINT / LETTERS; CARSON TRADE WAS GOOD, BUT DESTINATION WAS BAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I'm the first to applaud the trade of Jimmy Carson, but I sincerely question 
his destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Carson is a very talented individual with goal-scoring knack who simply was 
not fitting into the Kings' current scheme. A trade was the best move for the 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 But why send him to Vancouver? The Canucks, a division rival, have a very 
talented pair of wings to complement Carson's ability. 
</P>
<P>
 Nick Beverley has done a great job to strengthen the Canucks' lineup. Let's 
hope he can do the same for the Kings in the near future.

VIEWPOINT / LETTERS; BLACK COACHES' ACTIONS NOT BEING MET WITH RESOUNDING 
APPROVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is some truth to the fact that an additional athletic scholarship and a 
change in SAT requirements would give an opportunity to some disadvantaged 
youth who might never have gone to college. But I find it ironic that these 
black coaches are as exploitative as the schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than saying that higher educational standards and fewer scholarships 
might prompt these high school students to work harder and be better educated 
for a life after (or instead of) sports, these coaches seem to be more 
interested in the next Michael Jordan or Magic Johnson (some of whom can barely 
write). 
</P>
<P>
 These coaches should be imploring their high school counterparts, who with a 
wink and a nod allow these athletes to slide through school with the barest of 
scholastic ability, to be as vociferous about school work as they are about 
workouts.

 I am having a difficult time understanding the logic of the Black Coaches 
Assn., a group formed to promote job opportunities for obviously 
under-represented black basketball coaches. Unfortunately, the BCA is on its 
way to becoming the main impediment to future hiring of black coaches and a 
dupe "running interference" for the white colleagues who will ultimately 
benefit from public and institutional disgust with this entire sorry episode.

 A little college scholarship background: Full-time football scholarships are 
down from 120 to 85; men's basketball from 20 or more to 13. Where did these 
scholarships go? To women athletes -- basketball, soccer, track, volleyball, 
etc. -- this was well deserved and long overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 Do these black men's basketball coaches want these scholarships back from the 
women? Are these women athletes somehow less deserving than the men?

 The essence of the Olympics is competition. Regardless of the reason, Kerrigan 
did not compete. While special dispensation may be warranted, displacement of 
another competitor is not. It is akin to giving Steffi Graf's U.S. Open trophy 
to Monica Seles.

VIEWPOINT / LETTERS; RAIDER TICKET BUYERS CAN'T GET IT TOGETHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I was puzzled as to why the Raiders' playoff game had trouble selling out. 
Consider this: 
</P>
<P>
 I telephoned TicketMaster on Tuesday morning (Jan. 4) hoping to purchase at 
least three tickets (possibly four).Unfortunately, the customer service 
representative informed me that TicketMaster did not have three tickets 
available that were together. I was told I could purchase three single tickets, 
but that they would be located throughout the stadium. I then tried to purchase 
two tickets together and one close by. I was told TicketMaster didn't have that 
combination available, either. As a result, I ended up purchasing only two 
tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 How can there not be three tickets together somewhere in that bunch of 14,000 
unsold tickets? They can't all be single seats. Do the ticket brokers have them 
or what? I sure would be curious to find out.

VIEWPOINT / LETTERS; NOT EXACTLY BUZZING OVER ANGELS' MOVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1981, when Bill Bavasi joined the Angels, I was afraid that one day he 
would become general manager.Now, every Angel fan's worst nightmare has come 
true -- another Bavasi running the team. We can expect more bad trades, seeing 
the best players leave as free agents, and no strategy or commitment to putting 
a winning team on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes as no surprise to me that Whitey Herzog left. And it should also be 
no surprise that the Angels will never win the pennant until Angel fans wake up 
and demand new ownership.

ELLIS HAS GARDEN PARTY IN FIRST START; CLIPPERS: ROOKIE'S 29 POINTS HELP L.A. 
END A SEVEN-GAME LOSING STREAK WITH A 102-95 VICTORY OVER THE SAGGING CELTICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Clipper rookie Harold Ellis was wide eyed as he walked onto the parquet floor 
at the Boston Garden on Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen this place on TV all my life, but I've never been here," Ellis said 
as he stared at the 16 championship banners hanging from the rafters. "To make 
your first start at the Boston Garden, that's hard." 
</P>
<P>
 Clipper Coach Bob Weiss started Ellis, a 6-foot-5 swingman, in place of 
forward Loy Vaught to energize the Clippers, who had lost 11 of 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out in the meeting this morning and I was shocked," Ellis said of the 
start. "I was so nervous that I didn't eat all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis played as though he deserved to be a starter, scoring 29 points as the 
Clippers ended a seven-game losing streak and handed the Celtics a club-record 
seventh consecutive home loss, 102-95, before a sellout crowd of 14,890. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a dream come true," Ellis said of his performance. 
</P>
<P>
 This season has been a bad dream for the Celtics. 
</P>
<P>
 Off to their worst start since 1978-79, when they finished 29-53, the Celtics 
(13-23) have lost seven home games in a row for the first time in club history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course this is embarrassing," said Celtic center Robert Parish, who became 
the 12th player in NBA history to score 22,000 points by getting 21 against the 
Clippers. "Nobody likes to lose, especially at home, so it's not a good 
feeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're one of the worst teams in the league right now, and what's really 
embarrassing about it is that we're a better team than we've demonstrated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather have won the game than scored 22,000 points. That would have meant 
more than the individual accolade." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, who scored 14 first-quarter points, impressed Parish. Although he is 
only a rookie, Ellis didn't back down against Parish, a 17-year veteran. Ellis 
dunked over Parish in the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's fearless," Parish said of Ellis. "I like that. He plays with a lot of 
aggressiveness, and he has a big heart." 
</P>
<P>
 While several Clippers would probably rather be playing elsewhere because of 
contract disputes, Ellis seems truly happy to be playing for the Clippers. The 
last player the Clippers waived before the season opened, he played in the 
Continental Basketball Assn. before being signed last Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, who has averaged 26 points in his last two games, led the Clippers 
(12-21) by making 11 of 14 shots and all seven of his free throws. Ellis had a 
team-high five steals, four rebounds and a blocked shot. 
</P>
<P>
 'He's only got one speed, which is fifth gear," Weiss said. "I never dreamed 
he'd get this many points, but that's what I wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 Guard Mark Jackson agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to have one or two guys on every team who are just starving and 
who'll do anything for you, and Harold is that guy," Jackson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that Ellis might make rookie mistakes late in the game, Weiss replaced 
him with Gary Grant at the start of the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the Clippers trailing by 88-87 with 3:20 remaining, Weiss put in 
Ellis, who helped trigger an 11-2 spurt by scoring four points on a dunk and 
two free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "My gut just said go with Harold," Weiss said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis impressed teammate Danny Manning, who scored a game-high 34 points, 
including 21 in the second half. Manning, who had eight points in the final 
quarter, scored six of the Clippers' final 12 points and had a steal to set up 
Ellis' dunk. 
</P>
<P>
 "Harold brings us a lot of energy," Manning said. "He brings us a lot of easy 
baskets, which is what we need." 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis planned to celebrate by calling his mother, Mary, who watched the game 
on TV at her home in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 "She'll tell me the stuff I did wrong," Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 That part of their conversation will be brief.

FINISH LEAVES PEPPERDINE COLD; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: SANTA CLARA'S THREE-POINTERS 
MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN WEST COAST CONFERENCE OPENER, 54-51. 
</P>

<P>
 This wasn't the finish Pepperdine Coach Tom Asbury had in mind for his 
basketball team in its West Coast Conference opener against Santa Clara. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves led most of the way but went cold in the closing minutes as Santa 
Clara came back for a 54-51 victory Friday night before 3,043 at Firestone 
Fieldhouse in Malibu. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepperdine (8-5) appeared in control with 2:12 to play when point guard Bryan 
Parker sank a three-point basket, was also fouled on the play and made the free 
throw for a 49-44 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Waves managed only two free throws in the final two minutes while 
Santa Clara (8-5, 1-0) made three three-point baskets to pull out the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward DeWayne Lewis made two of the three-pointers and point guard John 
Woolery added the other. It was the final three-pointer by Lewis with 17 
seconds remaining that put the Broncos ahead to stay at 53-51. 
</P>
<P>
 After a Santa Clara free throw made it 54-51, Pepperdine had an opportunity to 
tie, but forward Dana Jones missed a three-point attempt as time expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, that's a familiar pattern for us," Asbury said. "We had the game 
completely under control and just stopped playing. It's been at different 
times, but we just plain stopped." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not the most artistic game for either team. Pepperdine had 19 
turnovers, Santa Clara 16. Pepperdine shot 39.6% (19 of 48), Santa Clara only 
33.3% (18 of 54). 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you quite candidly, neither team is going to be proud of their 
shooting percentage," Santa Clara Coach Dick Davey said. "But we have gotten 
used to a certain style of play against them and we just worked very hard for 
this." 
</P>
<P>
 Asbury took responsibility for his team's play. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll take the blame," he said. "We just self-destructed, and in a league game 
you just can't do that." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Clara was led by Lewis with 21 points, including 14 in the second half. 
Woolery added 14, 12 in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 The Waves were led by Jones with 16 points and 16 rebounds. Pepperdine was 
outrebounded, 40-37. 
</P>
<P>
 It had all the appearance of an opening conference game, particularly in the 
first half. Santa Clara shot only 32.1%, Pepperdine 33.3%, and the teams made 
10 turnovers each. The Waves led, 21-19, at the half.

LOYOLA LOSES BIG LEAD AND GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Loyola Marymount, after struggling in nonconference play, was hoping to make a 
fresh start Friday night in its West Coast Conference opener. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, the Lions suffered their worst collapse of the season, blowing a 
16-point lead in the second half as St. Mary's rallied for an 82-77 victory at 
Gersten Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's as tough a loss as I've had here," second-year Coach John Olive said. 
"The last five minutes were a nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola (1-11) appeared in good shape after taking its biggest lead, 69-53, on 
a layup by forward Wyking Jones with 7:18 to play. But in less than two 
minutes, St. Mary's (8-4, 1-0) had cut its deficit to six, 69-63, and put the 
Lions on the defensive. 
</P>
<P>
 A three-pointer by St. Mary's guard Darrell Daniel tied the score, 74-74, with 
2:12 left, and the Gaels took the lead for good at 76-74 when forward A.J. 
Rollins scored on a follow shot with 1:04 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Loyola, losing its 11th consecutive WCC game, made only two field goals in the 
last seven minutes and committed several of its 25 turnovers down the stretch. 
With the Lions trailing, 77-74, reserve guard Cobi McElroy inadvertently 
stepped on the sideline to turn the ball over with 26 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 That led to a three-point play by guard Martell Bland and an 80-74 Gael lead 
with 22 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones had game-high totals of 24 points and 10 rebounds for Loyola, which 
resumes WCC play tonight at home against Santa Clara.

 Golden Klair, who upset Pacific Squall and other older opponents in the Silver 
Belles Handicap last month at Hollywood Park, is the 3-1 favorite in today's 
$110,500 El Encino Stakes at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Never worse than third in her four American starts, Golden Klair earned her 
first U.S. victory by a half-length at 11-1 in the Silver Belles.Chris McCarron 
will again ride the daughter of Damister for trainer Darrell Vienna. 
</P>
<P>
 Stalcreek, who beat Golden Klair by a length in the Linda Vista Handicap over 
this track on Nov. 13, is the 7-2 second choice. She faded to fifth in the 
Dahlia Handicap on closing day of the Hollywood Park fall meeting, unable to 
handle a yielding turf course. With Eddie Delahoussaye serving the final day of 
his five-day suspension, Gary Stevens will ride Stalcreek.

MUIR REVES WINS DUEL AT GLENDALE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Muir High's Adrian Reves stole Glendale guard Ramon Jose's thunder Friday 
night with clutch free-throw shooting in the fourth quarter, pacing the 
Mustangs' 65-61 victory over the Dynamiters in a Pacific League game. 
</P>
<P>
 Reves, a 6-foot senior point guard, made all 10 of his free-throw attempts in 
the fourth quarter, including eight in the game's final 2 minutes 14 seconds, 
to keep Glendale at a distance. 
</P>
<P>
 Reves, who finished with a season-high 24 points, was part of the Mustangs' 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's our go-to guy down the stretch," Muir Coach Rocky Moore said. "He can 
fill it up and usually does." 
</P>
<P>
 Jose's fourth-quarter effort -- albeit inspiring -- proved futile for the 
Dynamiters. Jose, who finished with a team-high 23 points, scored 11 points in 
the fourth quarter, including two dramatic three-point baskets that put 
Glendale within striking distance. But the Dynamiters never drew closer than 
two points. 
</P>
<P>
 Muir improved to 12-9 overall and took sole possession of first place in 
league at 3-0. Glendale (14-5, 2-1), which led until late in the third quarter, 
had its six-game winning streak snapped. 
</P>
<P>
 After Muir opened the fourth quarter with a 10-3 run, the game's final four 
minutes came down to a shootout between Reves and Jose. Reves however, hit the 
bull's-eye more often. 
</P>
<P>
 With Glendale trailing, 57-48, with 3:45 remaining, Jose was fouled on a 
three-point attempt and hit all three free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 James Fuller (15 points) later followed with two free throws to get the 
Dynamiters within 57-53, but Reves answered with four consecutive free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose then hit a 15-foot jumper and a three-point basket from the left wing 
less than a minute later to make it 61-58. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reves was fouled underneath the basket on Jose's three-point goal, went to 
the other end and sank two more free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose, however, wasn't ready to call it a night. He buried his fifth and final 
three-point basket with 12 seconds remaining to keep the Dynamiters alive. 
</P>
<P>
 But Glendale was forced to foul Reves again, and he remained perfect by 
converting both with seven seconds remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale dominated the boards in the first half, outrebounding the Mustangs, 
15-5, and owned a 31-28 lead at halftime. Glendale led throughout the first 
half despite Muir's 58% field-goal accuracy.

CLEVELAND SETS TRAP AND RESEDA FALLS IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 OK, so his math needs a little work. He's a physical education teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, that's why they have scoreboards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Forty-two minutes of hell is what basketball is supposed to be," Cleveland 
High Coach Kevin Crider said. "Uh, eight-minute quarters . . . make that 32 
minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night at Cleveland, the game was virtually over in half that time as 
the Cavaliers spanked previously unbeaten Reseda, 77-62, in a Northwest Valley 
Conference game. 
</P>
<P>
 Unbelievable as it might seem, Reseda's strength was its weakness. The 
Regents' guard trio of Trenton Cross, Archie Williams and Damon Bailey 
struggled to get the ball past midcourt against Cleveland's trapping defense. 
And the feeding frenzy was on. 
</P>
<P>
 "We try to put the big men up front (in the trap)," Cleveland senior forward 
Jimmy Harris said. "That way, they have to throw the ball over you and you can 
intercept it sometimes." 
</P>
<P>
 If not intercept it often. Reseda (14-1, 2-1 in league play) committed a 
season-high 16 first-half turnovers as Cleveland (11-6, 2-1) took a lead as 
large as 20 points. 
</P>
<P>
 When Harris wasn't forcing the Reseda guards to lob passes over his 6-foot-5 
frame, he was dropping bombs of his own over their flailing arms. In fact, 
Harris landed the haymakers in the second quarter that put Reseda in a huge 
hole. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland led, 18-8, after the first quarter and didn't stop pouring it on. 
Harris canned three three-pointers over a 1-minute 31-second stretch to help 
give the Cavaliers a 31-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Something I worked on over the summer," Harris said, grinning. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda stumbled in every way imaginable. The Regents, who struggled to beat 
Kennedy by two points Wednesday, turned the ball over on their first five 
possessions of the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it was so much their trap or defensive pressure," said Cross, 
who scored 22 points before fouling out. "I think it was a lack of intensity. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played in spurts. You can't just turn it on when you want to." 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda made a run in the closing moments of the third quarter when Cross 
scored twice on acrobatic drives to pare the lead to 53-43. But Reseda could 
not cut the lead to single digits in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turnovers, missed free throws, everything," Reseda Coach Jeff Halpern said. 
"It was a team breakdown." 
</P>
<P>
 Proof positive that it was a night to forget: Bailey, a 92% free-throw 
shooter, had made 23 in a row from the line. He made one of three against 
Cleveland. Overall, Reseda made 11 of 22 free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 Reseda center Roderick Jones (17 points) kept the game from becoming a rout by 
scoring 10 of the Regents' 18 points in the second quarter. By then, however, 
eight Cleveland players had found the scoring column. Edtwaun Adams (13 points) 
and Louis Fernandez (10) also reached double figures. 
</P>
<P>
 The upset marked one of Cleveland's finest all-around efforts in some time. 
And the Cavaliers' defensive trap, well, was downright frenetic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tougher on some people than others," Crider said. "I don't think 
(Reseda) has seen the kind of pressure we can put on people." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams was held to 13 points -- and one field goal in the second half. Cross 
scored all but four of his points after halftime. But when the Regents 
repeatedly coughed up the ball to open the second half, it made for a tough 
mountain to climb. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crowd really got into it," Cross said. "But we gave them reason to be 
excited. We had a lack of effort in practice all week and it showed in the 
game."

SIMMONS PLAYS IT COOL AS SIMI VALLEY BEATS WESTLAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nathan Simmons has been a starter for the Simi Valley High boys' basketball 
team since his sophomore season, so the senior forward understands the 
importance of staying cool under pressure -- something the Pioneers have had 
their fill of lately. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering its game Friday night against Marmonte League-leading Westlake, Simi 
Valley already had two defeats in league play -- as many as the Pioneers had 
all last season. Often, the Pioneers have not played with the discipline and 
precision for which they are known. 
</P>
<P>
 So with the Pioneers badly in need of a victory, Simmons knew what to do -- 
lead the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons scored 20 points, including two clinching free throws with 12 seconds 
to play, to lead Simi Valley to an important 51-44 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew coming in we needed to knock off Westlake to keep the league race 
open," said Simmons, who also had 10 rebounds and five steals. "This one was 
really important for us so I tried to step up and keep making plays like I've 
tried to all season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things just really worked tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 That they did. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons was at his best when it counted most. He scored 15 points after 
halftime and 12 in the decisive fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 He made two free throws with 12 seconds remaining to give Simi Valley a 49-44 
lead, which secured the victory. He also closed the game's scoring by making 
two more free throws with two seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley (12-5, 3-2 in league play) entered the final quarter with a 30-26 
lead. Led by Simmons, the Pioneers took a 38-30 lead with 5 minutes 36 seconds 
to play. 
</P>
<P>
 But Westlake (10-3, 4-1) stormed back behind the play of forward Billy Miller, 
who scored 10 of his 12 points in the quarter. Westlake closed the lead to two 
twice in the quarter, but could not get any closer because of Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 Simmons scored eight of the Pioneers' final nine points in the game's final 
2:40. He also made several strong defensive plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nathan's leadership was just outstanding tonight," Pioneer Coach Dean 
Bradshaw said. "He made one play after another and sacrificed his body all game 
long." 
</P>
<P>
 Pioneer senior center Vernon Simmons (no relation) also played well, scoring 
11 points and grabbing 17 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this could be a big momentum builder for us," Vernon Simmons said. 
"We've been frustrated and down, and this will help." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who led Westlake with 15 rebounds, said the Warriors' offense was what 
lost the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offense just struggled all game long," he said. "I don't know what 
happened. But from the first quarter on we just couldn't get going. When we 
started to come back in the fourth quarter we were all positive we would win 
but we just couldn't seem to make the plays."

LOVE GETS THIRD EAGLE TO FINISH ROUND OF 60 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Davis Love III capped a 12-under-par 60 -- a score bettered only twice in PGA 
Tour history -- with his third eagle of the day and surged into a four-stroke 
lead Friday in the Hawaiian Open. 
</P>
<P>
 A 253-yard three-wood to the par-five 18th set up a downhill, 10-foot eagle 
putt. 
</P>
<P>
 He also scored eagles on the first and ninth holes and had six birdies in the 
round that fell a stroke short of the 59s compiled by Al Geiberger in Memphis 
in 1977 and Chip Beck in the 1990 Las Vegas Invitational. 
</P>
<P>
 Love's round in near-ideal conditions gave him a 128 total, 16 under par, for 
two rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was putting for eagle on the 13th, I was thinking, 'If I make this, I 
have a shot at 59,' " Love said. "That's the only time I lost focus." 
</P>
<P>
 Australian Brett Ogle and first-round leader Robin Freeman shared second at 
132.
