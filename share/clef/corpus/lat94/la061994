ANOTHER WAY OF SEEING AND KNOWING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What a unique and genuinely insightful article on autism by Mary Kay Blakely 
("A Place of Belonging," May 15). There was a bagful of raw and honest life 
lessons in that piece. Donna Williams may not actually "enjoy" that there's 
such an article about her, but I'll bet she doesn't mind it. 
</P>

<P>
 Although I am not, so far as I know, autistic, I found myself identifying with 
many of the defensive patterns listed by Blakely. The article introduced me to 
"another way of seeing, another way of knowing." 
</P>
<P>
 Donna's and Paul's "systems to keep the 'self' from disappearing during 
frightening emotions" are echoed within my own life. I have been unaware of how 
strongly influenced I am by patterns from my own experiences. As I read the 
article, I realized that I constantly regurgitate lines of dialogue from my 
past instead of responding to a situation in a thinking manner. 
</P>
<P>
 Donna's descriptions of "bright spots of translucent color dancing before her 
eyes" parallels my own experiences, and I have never comprehended why other 
people didn't understand what I was talking about. Now, if I can just learn who 
or what my "self" is . . . .

 My beautiful 8-year-old "attention deficit hyperactive disorder" son, 
alternately described as brilliant and impossible, has provided an immense and 
often overwhelming challenge for me. What I learned from Blakely's story is 
that many of the complex operations and "malfunctions" of his mind are similar 
to those of Donna and Paul, and therefore I have derived great hope from 
reading how these two special people have learned to deal with and overcome 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Thank you for providing a window of hope.

 After reading Blakely's article, I will forever regret that I cannot sing a 
song "written by birds" nor feel all that Donna feels and sees in her very 
special world.

 What a remarkable thing it must be to be so aware of each and every external 
sound and color, indeed to be able to see things that ordinary people cannot, 
yet be thrown into hopeless despair by the touch or look of another human 
being. Is that the terrible price Donna must pay for being able to learn the 
music of the birds?

 I recently retired from a 20-year mainstream-education teaching career, during 
which I had the privilege of teaching one autistic student. This young man made 
it into regular classes through his own efforts and a tremendous amount of love 
and work on the part of his adoptive parents. If I had been able to read an 
article like Blakely's in those days, I might have been better able to 
understand the obstacles that student had to overcome on a daily basis.

 Finally, someone who truly understands. Donna's lifestyle, moving in a "red" 
world, sounded so much like mine. However, African Americans call it 
"assimilation," or "living in a redneck world." The big difference, of course, 
is that racism isn't an acknowledged illness, and, therefore, we have no 
medication with which to control it.

DON'T BE SO QUICK TO MOTHBALL CARRIERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The so-called "Dinosaurs at Sea" (by Michael Wright, May 15) may be expensive 
and somewhat vulnerable (they haven't been scratched by the enemy since World 
War II), but they now may offer a haven to career-demanding women in the air 
Navy. As a former Marine carrier flyer, I'd say that carriers are still the 
most effective tool that this megapower can deploy to take on both brush-fire 
military engagements and incipient major wars. Until something better comes 
along, they offer us the best bargain around. 
</P>
<P>
 It we are not going to reconstruct ourself as a minor power, as has 
not-so-Great Britain, we must keep this striking force at its best while it 
awaits the go-ahead sign to do the job we've paid it to do: displaying the flag 
everywhere. There's nothing better than an air show to put the fuzzy-wuzzies 
down before the shooting starts.

<P>
 We mustn't forget that our potential adversaries can read the lessons of the 
Gulf War as well as we can. One lesson Wright omitted: Don't give the United 
States months to move its land-based tactical forces into position. If Iraq had 
continued into Saudi Arabia, there would have been no force to defend the 
tactical air fields, leaving such protection to our long-range bombers, which 
at that time were without Stealth capabilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Iraq known we would respond, perhaps they wouldn't have attacked. The 
number of carriers, as well as the size of other forces, should be discussed 
after the government decides what our foreign policy is to be.

 Wright says that the carrier Ranger was used for joint force experiments in 
1993. That retired ship was mothballed last year; the joint experiment carrier 
that was used was the Theodore Roosevelt.

COVER STORY: GETTING DOWN AND DIRTY ON DAYTIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Damian Smith is living up to his demonic name on ABC's "General Hospital." In 
the year or so since he was introduced on the soap, Damian (played by Leigh J. 
McCloskey) has impersonated a police officer and stolen official records, 
committed blackmail and, on a recent bet, seduced Bobbie, wreaking havoc on her 
marriage.  
</P>
<P>
 "The way I'm headed, I think I should change the number on my (character's) 
apartment door to 666," says McCloskey. 
</P>
<P>
 Over on CBS' "Guiding Light," Roger Thorpe (Michael Zaslow) has wreaked some 
havoc on his own during his many years on the show: At last count he's had 
affairs with three married women, raped two women, including his wife, Holly, 
and accidentally killed a woman when he threw her down a flight of stairs. This 
summer, Roger's thirst for power continues. If history repeats itself, the 
woman now in his life (Holly, again) should be on full alert. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no gender discrimination when it comes to daytime deviltry. On NBC's 
"Days of Our Lives," Vivian Alamain (Louise Sorel) buried alive Carly, the 
woman whose son Vivian had raised after telling Carly the baby had died, and 
who was engaged to marry Vivian's own son. More recently, she switched embryos 
to have herself impregnated by Victor, the man she loves, who is involved with 
Kate. Members of this triangle will be "inextricably linked," according to the 
network, for more summer shenanigans -- all due to Vivian's scheming. 
</P>
<P>
 On somewhat the same theme, Kimberlin Brown, while on "The Young and the 
Restless" playing Sheila Carter Granger, suffered a miscarriage, faked a 
full-term pregnancy, then swapped the newborn baby of her husband and his 
ex-wife Lauren with one she had bought, passing off Lauren's baby as hers. 
What's more, she tried to kill her own mother, who knew the truth. She is now 
in residence on the "Young and Restless" sister show, "The Bold and the 
Beautiful," having married the prominent Eric Forrester. Look for her to have 
blood on her hands this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 If the basis of soap opera is conflict, then obviously you can't have the good 
guys without the bad guys. Indeed, soap vixens and villains -- those colorful 
troublemakers that viewers love to hate -- have proven to be some of the 
medium's most enduring, endearing characters. 
</P>
<P>
 "People love to watch villains because they know they're a catalyst, that 
something's going to happen," says James Reilly, head writer for "Days of Our 
Lives," who concocted the "Buried Alive" storyline for that soap. "It's like a 
bolt of lightning. They feel, 'We have to watch, to see what's going to go on.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 McCloskey, who previously played a serial rapist (and gynecologist) on the 
defunct "Santa Barbara," agrees. "In real life, most people lead reactive 
lives. In drama, it's the same thing. Most characters go on on an even keel. 
When Damian was introduced, suddenly Bobbie and (husband) Tony were reacting to 
a foreign body, suddenly there was doubt that tomorrow was going to be the same 
as today. You need someone to bring in a sense of uncertainty. Damian's there 
to make people not as comfortable." 
</P>
<P>
 There's much more to soap villainy than dastardly deeds, however. Classic 
evildoers -- as opposed to short-term criminal characters brought on 
specifically, say, to commit a murder -- are as multidimensional as their more 
noble showmates. "Days' " Vivian, for instance, is motivated by her unmet need 
to give love, channeled in the wrong direction. Sheila's nefariousness 
escalated when her love for a man became an obsession with him and his child. 
</P>
<P>
 On NBC's "Another World," the character Carl Hutchins, played by Charles 
Keating, was probably responsible for Rachel going blind, kidnaping her 
daughter and trying to kill a man, but he is now genuinely in love with Rachel. 
And McCloskey calls his own character "a nest of contradictions," mixing 
ambition with vulnerability. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all characters are even created as villains, but become so as a particular 
storyline evolves. Says William J. Bell, co-creator of "Young and the Restless" 
and "Bold and Beautiful" and the senior head writer and senior executive 
producer of the former soap and co-executive producer and executive story 
consultant of the latter: "Sheila was never originally meant to be a heavy. She 
emerged. The pressures of her story, her situation as a character made her do 
things that otherwise she might not have done. She loved this baby and tried 
everything she could to get him. She lost it where was Lauren was concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 "Days' " Reilly also calls Vivian's actions "a natural progression. The next 
logical thing was for the character to cross the line." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many soap scoundrels do not think of themselves as even a wee bit 
evil. "I think a villain doesn't know he is a villain," says Zaslow, who 
originated the role of Roger Thorpe 22 years ago, played him again in 1989 
after a 10-year hiatus and last month won a Daytime Emmy Award for his lead 
acting. 
</P>
<P>
 Zaslow's character "tries to go after what he wants. He's very passionate, 
driven by needs he doesn't understand. As my then-7-year-old daughter said last 
year, 'What Roger is, is selfish.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Reilly: "Villains have their own set of laws and moral codes. They 
believe the ends justify the means. There's a little seed of justification, 
where they think what they do is right." He cites "Days" longtime crime boss 
Stefano DiMera (Joe Mascolo), who will stop at nothing to protect his adopted 
daughter Kristen. "If people wouldn't do things to get in his way, he wouldn't 
have to do anything to them." 
</P>
<P>
 And how do those who know them best -- the actors -- feel about portraying 
these convoluted cads? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more fun playing a catalyst," says McCloskey, who has a long list of 
"nice guy" credits, including Dr. Mitch Cooper on "Dallas."  
</P>
<P>
 For baby-swapping Brown, who gave birth to her own first daughter in January, 
motherhood has not softened her alter ego's depiction. "Sheila is just a 
character," she says. "I play her the way she's written. My personal life is so 
different from my work life." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown does confess to some trepidation as to how viewers might react to 
Sheila's activities, but has received only a few bothersome letters. And Zaslow 
made sure that the rape of his character's wife was depicted as the act of 
violence it was. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no question that villainy pays off, particularly in the ratings. 
Reilly says that "Days' " Nielsen numbers marked an increase of 68% among the 
key women's groups during last summer's buried alive story line. 
</P>
<P>
 Such viewer fascination occurs, Reilly says, because "the audience understands 
what the classic villains do. They may not agree with it, but I think that deep 
down, everyone has wanted to do something evil. They have the feeling, 'There 
but for the grace of God could have gone I.' "

 I know I speak for many in the architectural community in saying that we need 
more articles like "L.A. Architects: They Did It Their Way" (by Joseph 
Giovannini, Style, May 15). It is vital for the continued health of the 
profession that L.A.'s contributions and leadership in architecture be 
recognized throughout the world. 
</P>
<P>
 JEFFREY DANIELS AIA 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 Those bizarre designs are very appropriate for Los Angeles. They look as 
though they have already been wrecked by an earthquake. Whatever happened to 
the straight line? To functional design? All the principles of architecture 
have been grossly violated. 
</P>
<P>
 The Temporary Powell Library at UCLA is burlesque show-biz at its worst. 
Anything for a laugh. A clear manifestation of a crazy, mixed-up society. A 
plague on all their houses!

</P>
<P>
 Giovannini's fawning press release on Los Angeles architects was written with 
all the objectivity of a Laker cheerleader. The Temporary Library is a classic 
eyesore, featuring a self-absorbed design that shows disregard and disdain for 
its surroundings. It is like a schoolyard bully who uses brute strength to 
muscle others out of his way in a desperate bid for attention. If this is a 
lauded example of L.A.'s architectural future, I'll definitely take Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
 ELLEN BYRON 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's architecture program, contrary to the indications in Giovannini's 
article, has not been "hobbled" by administrative restructuring. Among those 
you mentioned who have recently joined our faculty are Craig Hodgetts and Thom 
Mayne; continuing faculty mentioned are Julie Eizenberg, Frank Israel, Barton 
Phelps and Dagmar Richter. Israel, Mayne and Hodgetts have all received the 
coveted award for achievement from the National Academy of Arts and Sciences, 
and Prof. Thomas Hines, who teaches history, is to be inducted into the board 
of the academy this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The strengthening of UCLA's architecture/urban design program could not have 
occurred without the support of the chancellor's office, administrative 
restructuring notwithstanding.

 Regarding Jonathan Gold's column on telecommuting ("Working It Out," Three on 
the Town, May 1): A telecommuter's employer does know that the employee is 
working -- more so than most employers. Rather than merely filling a chair or 
punching a time clock, a telecommuter has agreed with the boss to produce a 
certain amount of work.The quality of that work is then judged on its merit, 
not by how long it took to execute it. 
</P>
<P>
 I telecommute because it means integrating work into all of life, rather than 
relegating it to an eight-hour block under fluorescent lights. If being in the 
suburbs while I edit three international consumer magazines, weed a garden, 
represent my area for Women in Communications, lay out a newsletter for the 
Telecommuting Advisory Council and teach an adult literacy student means that 
I'm holing up and missing out, so be it.

PRIME-TIME FLICKS

By KEVIN THOMAS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 1992 Taking Back My Life (CBS Sunday at 9 p.m.) may be the boldest 
expression of rape that has ever aired on prime-time network television. Above 
all, it is a gritty human story based on the real-life victim Nancy 
Ziegenmeyer, an Iowa mother of three who elected to go public with graphic 
details of her 1988 case as a clarion call to victims of rape, in hopes of 
lifting their burden of shame and anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dad (ABC Sunday at 9 p.m.), the 1989 film of William Wharton's 1981 
novel, goes from an honest, painful portrayal to a family-style uplift, Jack 
Lemmon is extraordinary in the title role. He plays a 75-year-old retiree 
confronted with the terrors of old age. There's splendid support, too, from 
Olympia Dukakis as his nasty wife and Ted Danson as his son, a self-absorbed 
Wall Street go-getter. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 TV movie In the Line of Duty: Ambush at Waco (NBC Monday at 9 p.m.) 
adds little to the lore of Branch Davidian sect leader David Koresh (Tim Daly) 
-- a musician-singer who proclaimed himself the Messiah for his followers. Nor 
does it provide insight into the minds of charismatic zealots such as Koresh 
and those who would submit to him so obediently. 
</P>
<P>
 What elevates Call Me Anna (ABC Monday at 9 p.m.), a turbulent 1990 TV movie 
based on the life of Patty Duke, above the crowd are its wrenching depictions 
of her tragically bizarre childhood and her mental illness that seemed to 
surface only later; Duke plays herself as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Greta Schiller and Robert Rosenberg's 1985 Before Stonewall: The Making of a 
Gay and Lesbian Community (KCET Wednesday at 9 p.m.) reveals what life was like 
for gays and lesbians before gay liberation. It does so largely through 
interviews with men and women who have the wit and humor of survivors who have 
at times endured virtually medieval oppression.

 Paris Poirier's 1993 Last Call at Maud's (KCET Wednesday at 10:30 p.m.) at 
once bids fond farewell to a cherished San Francisco landmark and documents a 
social revolution; you can't help, however, but suspect that the loss of Maud's 
reflects the loss of a sense of community that permeates so much of American 
life today. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Handsome (KCOP Thursday at 8 p.m.), a 1989 Walter Hill thriller about a 
deformed sociopath (Mickey Rourke) and his second chance at life, has a 
temperament like a three-time loser. This action movie works fine in its 
hard-bitten, gutsy first half when it's locked up in the jail or the hospital, 
but when it's sprung into the open air it can't handle freedom.

ROLL ALL THE CREDITS

 I was very interested in the commentary "Go Ahead! Ruin Our Credits" (TV 
Times, May 29).It proved that I was not the only one annoyed by the networks' 
practice of squeezing the closing credits into a corner so they could use the 
extra time to promote upcoming programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The people who worked on a production deserve the recognition. Also, viewers 
should have the opportunity to see who did what on any particular production or 
listen to the theme music instead of irritating promotional chatter.

ON THE TOWN: THE REGULAR; THERE'S A PLACE WHERE THEY NOT ONLY KNOW YOUR NAME 
BUT HOW TO CUSTOMIZE YOUR BURRITOS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 I spent my early 20s on the back stools of a smelly Hollywood rock club, 
nursing soggy paper cups of cheap draft beer, wincing along with my friends 
when a Valley-bred lead singer barked lyrics in a cockney accent or pummeled 
yet another heavily miked oil drum with grandpa's belt sander. We were pathetic 
punk-rock has-beens, most of us, veterans of a thousand lousy shows, sick of 
rock 'n' roll and of each other. But we were there almost every night the club 
was open, hoping for a good band against ruinous odds, happy that at least we 
had somewhere to go. We were regulars, and it felt as if we belonged. It was as 
close to community as any of us ever got. 
</P>
<P>
 You can hang at joints-of-the-hour if you like, though they tend to be 
populated by dudes who have had something to do with the latest Motley Crue 
video and by young women just learning how to smoke. You can go to a different 
coffeehouse every night. But it's kind of cooler being a regular at a place, 
having a bartender know that you abhor lemon peel with your espresso, a doorman 
wave you through, a Sumatran cook remember that you like your shrimp fried rice 
well done and triple-hot. I secretly envy people in those glossy magazine 
stories who have eaten lunch in the same restaurant every weekday since 1983. 
(I've never had a sandwich named after me .) 
</P>
<P>
 When you're a regular, you can show up bearing a cantaloupe and be sure that 
the chef will make you the prosciutto-and-melon pizza he took off the menu last 
year. A waiter may take the time to translate specials from the Burmese. You 
can go in every day for a grilled cheese sandwich and irritate the grill guy 
with your perfectionism: Will the cheese be too liquid today, the toast too 
crisp, the hot chile paste too sparsely spread? I am still happy when a 
counterman barks: "Pastrami burrito! No cabbage!" when he sees me walk into a 
taco stand I haven't really frequented since college. There may be Snoop Doggy 
Dogg instead of the Dazz Band on the jukebox now, but the place still feels 
like home. 
</P>
<P>
 I once became obsessed for a while with the idea of becoming a regular at a 
famous Sunset Strip restaurant, of finding out the number of duck dinners you 
had to eat before somebody slipped you the telephone number of the restaurant's 
private line, how many chopped salads an unconnected guy had to stare down at 
10:30 p.m. before he could finally command a reservation between 7 and 9. But 
to hang at places like this costs money, of which I had very little, and 
becoming a regular seemed to require more than simply wishing it to be so. 
</P>
<P>
 After a couple of evenings spent squeezed against the back wall near the 
women's restroom -- a long, mournful pizza toss from the window tables occupied 
by Mariette Hartley and Ed Begley Jr., even given the 10:30 reservation time -- 
I may have felt like a regular, but only in the sense of being not premium . . 
. it would be years before I'd rate the "Jewish pizza" appetizer that everybody 
else in the restaurant seemed to regard as their birthright. And, ultimately, I 
knew that for me, becoming a regular had far less to do with trying to join a 
community than it did with mastering, for antic reasons, the rudiments of darts 
or bid whist. 
</P>
<P>
 Because in the end, the point of becoming a regular is getting to know the 
other regulars -- the bi-coastal agent who frequents East L.A. tamale stands, 
the steelworker who croons Western swing, the cinematographer with a trunkful 
of old Cabernet, the swinging fabric merchant renowned as an upholsterer to the 
stars. That way, your chances of finding someone to talk to while you work on 
dismantling a thyme-charred sea bass with artichokes become pretty good.

'LUCY' STILL THE BEST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While watching reruns of "I Love Lucy" on KTTV Channel 11, I am still amazed 
at the great talent of the late Lucille Ball. There is no doubt that "I Love 
Lucy" is the best situation comedy of all time, followed by, in my opinion, the 
wonderfully clever "Beverly Hillbillies" and the clean and good "The Andy 
Griffith Show." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the highest-rated situation comedies of today are not of the caliber 
of the older programs, as most of the current ones have sexual overtones and 
lack basic good taste.

COMMENTARY; A FEW POINTS OF VIEW VERY WELL TAKEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRAZIER MOORE, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here comes trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 As in: Viewer, could we trouble you to use your brain? 
</P>
<P>
 As in: Gosh, I might have to go to the trouble of rethinking what I think. 
</P>
<P>
 That's trouble, with a capital "T," which rhymes with "P.O.V.," which stands 
for "Point of View." 
</P>
<P>
 "Very rarely do people look at a 'P.O.V.' film and shrug their shoulders and 
go about their business without giving what they've seen a second thought," 
says Marc Weiss, who fathered this series of independent nonfiction films. 
</P>
<P>
 Back for its seventh summer season, "P.O.V." means a welcome spot of trouble 
through mid-August on the PBS schedule (it airs in Los Angeles Tuesday nights). 
</P>
<P>
 This week, "P.O.V." presents "Escape From China" by Chinese journalist Iris F. 
Kung (a pseudonym), who returns to her homeland to retrace the "underground 
railroad" that helped the last of China's most-wanted Tian An Men Square 
leaders escape to freedom. 
</P>
<P>
 A week earlier, the series presented "One Nation Under God," a film by Teodoro 
Maniaci and Francine Rzeznik that chronicles some of the all too many attempts 
to "cure" homosexuality -- and examines why the church, the psychiatric 
community and other segments of society have pressured lesbians and gay men to 
"recover." 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that somebody is homosexual," one "expert" intones in a clip from a 
30-year-old documentary, "automatically rules out the possibility that he will 
remain happy for long." 
</P>
<P>
 Assume for a moment this is true, responds a current-day gay man, who then 
ponders, "If someone was unhappy being tall, would those same people call for 
sawing off his legs?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the following weeks you can look forward to: 
</P>
<P>
 -- "The End of the Nightstick," an expose that unravels a history of abuse of 
suspects by the Chicago police. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Hearts of Darkness," a behind-the-scenes look at Francis Ford Coppola's 
mad struggle to finish his 1979 feature "Apocalypse Now" before it finished 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- "Dialogues With Madwomen," by Academy Award winner Allie Light, in which 
she and six other women describe their experiences with manic depression and 
other mental disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 As should be clear by now, the films of "P.O.V." (would the series be more 
aptly called "POINTS of View"?) are as varied and as personal as fingerprints. 
</P>
<P>
 What do they have in common? All have cleared the rigorous selection process 
"P.O.V" imposes on the more than 500 films submitted each year. 
</P>
<P>
 After 40 semifinalists are chosen by a committee of filmmakers and public TV 
programmers, Weiss huddles with his co-executive producer, Ellen Schneider, to 
identify the 10 that should air. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look for a mix," Weiss says, "a good cross-section, some lighter, some 
more serious, with a variety of subjects, and a range of approaches -- 
subjective to the more issue-oriented to slice-of-life." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no political litmus test," Schneider adds. " 'P.O.V.' has no 
ideological agenda." 
</P>
<P>
 They must be doing something right. In its first six seasons, the series has 
won five Peabody Awards (known as broadcasting's Pulitzer Prize), among other 
honors. 
</P>
<P>
 And while it doesn't exactly go looking for trouble, "P.O.V." has found it 
along the way, most notably three years ago with "Tongues Untied," a vision of 
black gay life that ignited a firestorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Conservative legislators (without necessarily troubling themselves to see it) 
called the film pornographic and blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was a risky film," Weiss explains, "but we also thought that if we 
didn't put it on, there would really be no reason for the series to continue. 
It was important not to pull back and say, 'This might be too hot to handle.' " 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't, and they didn't, and, having weathered that storm, the hardy 
"P.O.V." persists in challenging each viewer to re-examine his or her own 
P.O.V. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a transformative experience," Weiss says. "People watching an hour 
or so of TV and then changing the way they think about something." 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble, yes. But no problem.

SHOWS FOR YOUNGSTERS AND THEIR PARENTS TOO; HOW NICKELODEON'S 'ROUNDHOUSE' 
HOOKS A SATURDAY NIGHT AUDIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Saturday night challenge of entertaining a young audience, many of whom 
would rather be out of the house, has led Nickelodeon to save its Roundhouse 
for last. 
</P>
<P>
 Programmers over at Nick have moved the popular variety show "Roundhouse" from 
8:30 to 10 p.m., the end of its "Snick" programming block that includes "The 
Adventures of Pete & Pete" and a couple of animated gross-outs named "Ren & 
Stimpy."  
</P>
<P>
 The initial concept of "Roundhouse" came to creator Buddy Sheffield in 1975, 
when he first saw NBC's "Saturday Night Live" sketch series. He thought that a 
similar show aimed at kids could offer both entertainment and encouragement in 
their formative years. 
</P>
<P>
 Each "Roundhouse" revolves around a single theme, with skits, songs and dances 
that work around it. The skits are designed with a child's attention span; none 
are longer than 60 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 This rapid-fire technique "doesn't condescend to kids, it's more like 
irreverent comedy with a message," says John Crane, a 32-year-old writer and 
member of the cast. "Kids latch on to that. We're not talking down to them. It 
moves so quickly, and yes, it's geared to the MTV generation, where most kids 
are channel-surfing and this show can grab their attention and keep it there." 
</P>
<P>
 Benny Hester, executive producer, likes to compare the show to a thrill ride. 
"It's high-impact," he says. "Its like being on a high-powered roller coaster 
ride. We pack an hour variety show into 30 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids have such a good sense of humor," adds cast member Julene Renee. "A lot 
of adults don't think kids can understand as much as they do. But they relate 
to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Many skits center on family situations, with a mom and dad (often played by 
Crane) and kids, played by the twentysomething cast members who take on various 
roles. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's great," Crane says about the CableAce Award-winning show. "We often have 
multiracial casts and never refer to it as part of the skit." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to characters in TV parodies such as "The Broody Brunch," "Fully 
Housebroken" and "Fleas Company," the cast "plays all kinds of famous people, 
too," says Renee. "I've been Michael Jackson, Susan Powter, Loni Anderson and 
Shannen Doherty." 
</P>
<P>
 With no sets and just a stage to work with, Crane emphasizes that the show 
also tries to create an atmosphere of imagination, using props that are 
suggestive, like "a hubcap for steering wheel, or a piece of pipe that we 
always use for a phone." Shows, including the skits and music in each, are 
written and choreographed in three days, rehearsed for two, and then taped live 
before a studio audience in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're always wrapping up with a message," Renee concludes. "For instance, one 
of the most important shows to me was one we did on gangs. We showed people 
that it doesn't matter what color you are. What matters is resolving problems. 
We also let kids make up their own minds." 
</P>
<P>
 "Roundhouse" airs Saturdays on Nickelodeon at 10 p.m. as the last show in its 
program block called Snick (Saturday Night Nickelodeon); it repeats Sundays at 
7:30 p.m. For ages 6 to 16.

FAMILIES IN TRANSITION; AMC'S 'HOMEWARD BOUND' LOOKS TO THE MOVIES FOR SOCIAL 
REFLECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 "Homeward Bound," American Movie Classics' latest original documentary, offers 
a sociological and historical spin on how Hollywood has portrayed the American 
family throughout the decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't have done this documentary 20 years ago because the family was 
one thing in the '40s, and completely fell apart in the '60s and the '70s," 
says producer, director and co-creator Linda Shaffer. "Then, you see the cycle 
come back in the '80s. The family has sort of redefined itself." 
</P>
<P>
 "Homeward Bound" features directors and actors Ellen Burstyn ("Alice Doesn't 
Live Here Any more"), Ron Howard ("Parenthood"), Robert Benton ("Kramer vs. 
Kramer"), Barry Levinson ("Avalon"), Paul Mazursky ("Bob & Carol & Ted & 
Alice," "An Unmarried Woman") and Elizabeth McGovern ("Ordinary People") 
discussing how the values and traditions of the American family have changed 
through the decades. The documentary shows how those changes are reflected 
through Hollywood's movies, chronologically including: "Andy Hardy Gets Spring 
Fever" (1939), "The Grapes of Wrath" (1940), "Since You Went Away" (1944), "A 
Tree Grows in Brooklyn" (1945), "The Best Years of Our Lives" (1946), "Father 
of the Bride" (1950), "East of Eden" (1955), "Rebel Without a Cause" (1955), "A 
Raisin in the Sun (1961), "Guess Who's Coming to Dinner (1967), "The Graduate" 
(1967), " Bob & Carol & Ted & Alice" (1969), "Kramer Vs. Kramer" (1979), 
"Ordinary People (1980), "Baby Boom" (1987), "Parenthood" (1989), "Avalon" 
(1990) and "Menace II Society" (1993). 
</P>
<P>
 Also featured in "Homeward Bound" is Stephanie Coontz, a professor of family 
and social history at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Wash., who believes 
contemporary TV and features are much more realistic in portraying the 
diversity of families. Still, she adds, families still buy into a lot of "myths 
when they discuss how families have changed. For example, what we now think of 
as a 'traditional family' -- the male breadwinner, the female homemaker and the 
kids at school -- only in the 1920s did a bare majority of children come to 
live in that kind of family. A lot of other peoples' lives were being ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 Coontz adds that the "perfect" family has remained an ideal for the 1990s. "I 
think in the end of the 1980s, some of that celebration of family that comes 
across in the documentary as all positive was also tinged with a re-creation of 
some myths," she says. "The movie I think of is 'Fatal Attraction,' where the 
good girl is the woman who stays home. It's so powerful a message against a 
high-powered female." 
</P>
<P>
 When she looks at the evolution of the family in movies, Coontz sees a loss of 
a sense of community in America. "I think there's a tendency to substitute 
family for that." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the first films to illustrate the loss of community, Coontz says, is 
the 1955 film "Marty." "The conflict there is between loyalty to kin group and 
neighborhood, and it gets settled in favor of the nuclear family." 
</P>
<P>
 That wasn't the case with such '40's classics as "The Grapes of Wrath" and 
"The Best Years of Our Lives." In those films, Coontz explains, the family is a 
microcosm of social forces. "The mother in 'Grapes of Wrath' is not saying, 'I 
will be an even better mother.' She is standing for the resistance of an entire 
community. And in 'Best Years of Our Lives,' those are not just individual 
problems but real problems of coming back to a world that has changed. Unlike 
the '30s and '40s, all too often the family in modern film treatments doesn't 
become a way of lining up with others, a base in which to make connections. It 
becomes a personal oasis or a substitute for other connections." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Coontz says she hasn't seen any movie that "really confronts the 
complexity of family life with the trade-off that some things are a real step 
forward, and some things pose new problems and you can't escape them by taking 
your baby, moving to the country and starting your own business, like in 'Baby 
Boom.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Coontz said she believes ABC's long-running sitcom "Roseanne" "comes closest 
to showing a real family with all its dysfunctions and its incredible love and 
connections that go beyond (the family). I think TV is a little bit ahead 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 "Homeward Bound" airs Tuesday at 6 and 9 p.m. on AMC.

PALM LATITUDES: ON THE RECORD; EL PUEBLO DE NUESTRA SENORA, LA REINA DE LOS

 If you've got the feeling that L.A. is a city on the verge of a nervous 
breakdown, your fears are well grounded. And now they're well documented.Just 
stop by USC and ask to see Anthony Anderson's collection of books and 
documents, titled "Los Angeles -- A City in Stress." Thumb through the "Report 
on Estimated Short-Term Losses in Direct Visitor Spending as a Result of the 
Recent Civil Unrest" or "Assessment of the Performance of the California 
National Guard During the Civil Disturbances in Los Angeles" or Amnesty 
International's controversial report, "United States of America: Torture, 
Ill-Treatment and Excessive Force by Police in Los Angeles, California." 
</P>
<P>
 These are just a few of the thousands of pages documenting the city's recent 
woes that Anderson, a 41-year-old USC librarian, has tracked down over the past 
two years. The collection includes material on crime, gangs, homelessness, 
post-Cold War recession -- almost all the problems that have helped make the 
city an icon of 1990s urban ills. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was going to call it 'L.A.: An Awful Place to Live,' " jokes Anderson. 
"Actually, I love Los Angeles. I wanted to collect everything I could about 
those problems. I thought that might help people understand them and maybe even 
solve them someday." 
</P>

 "This will be the historians' first stop" for researching L.A. in the early 
1990s, Anderson says. The collection is available to the rest of us as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson has yet to add anything about that other great stress-maker, the 
Northridge earthquake. "But," he says, "it was another good example of the city 
in stress, so I guess I'll have to. I just hope we don't have too many other 
things happening any time soon. This collection could get out of hand." Gordon

PALM LATITUDES: THE WORD; SAM SPADE, MEET MR. GREEN JEANS

 When Elizabeth Stromme passes the Burpee display, she's not just thinking 
about tomatoes or flowers -- she's thinking about murder and conspiracies. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeds and big-buck agribusiness are at the center of Stromme's first published 
thriller, "Against the Grain," whose hero, a former aerospace security expert, 
gets caught in a deadly corporate conspiracy involving a seed that could mean 
billions to whoever owns it.Even when members of a friend's seed-collecting 
club disappear or turn up dead, he finds it hard to believe that they are being 
killed for seeds. "It doesn't occur to him that seeds can also be economic 
forces that endanger this country's lifeblood," says Stromme, an avid gardener 
and seed collector. 
</P>
<P>
 The story starts in Los Angeles, but don't look for her novel at your local 
bookstore, unless you live in Paris. Stromme lives in Silver Lake but struck 
out pitching her book to agents in L.A. and in New York. She had better luck in 
France, where she met the director of the popular mystery line Serie Noire, the 
home-away-from-home for Chandler, Hammett and Cain. She outlined her story for 
him -- she's fluent in French -- and he liked it. The rest is mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gangraine" -- the French title of her book -- will be published this fall by 
Gallimard, perhaps the most prestigious publisher in France (they do Sartre and 
Camus, as well as the Serie Noire), but Stromme is still hearing nothing but 
slamming doors in the United States. "Most agents," says Stromme, "feel that 
seeds are too weird a subject for a thriller." Mari Florence

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the printing press, literacy was rare, and scribes were just about the 
only people who could put pen to paper and come up with anything but a doodle. 
So they took pride in their work, turning a Bible passage or a royal decree 
into colored, gilded works of art.But now, their works survive mainly in 
museums and memory. 
</P>
<P>
 Skip to Los Angeles. It's five centuries past Gutenberg. Everywhere, pixels 
seem ready to replace paper. Everywhere but Jeff Cane's studio. 
</P>
<P>
 Cane, a transported Brit, is L.A.'s self-proclaimed scribe. Inspired by the 
illuminated manuscripts of the Middle Ages, Cane transforms his clients' 
letters, poetry and documents into beautiful and authentically old-looking 
works of opulence. A single illuminated page with ribbons, raised leaf letters 
and a wax seal, placed by hand on parchment, goes for about $300. 
</P>
<P>
 His company, An Englishman in L.A., has drawn several hundred clients, 
including Oprah Winfrey, Aaron Spelling, Leeza Gibbons and Mickey Rourke, who 
sold his Cane-reproduced poetry at auction. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I do is something from the past that conjures up gallantry, knights on 
white horses, chivalry and romance," Cane says. "I am finding Los Angeles -- 
contrary to popular belief -- to be a city of very romantic people." Janet

PALM LATITUDES: CREATURE FEATURE; FALL OF THE MONARCHY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Are we down to the last butterfly? In the past few years, the number of 
Western monarch butterflies coming to California has dwindled alarmingly. In 
previous winters, more than a million migrated from other Western states; this 
year, scientists say, the count was down by 95%. 
</P>
<P>
 "About 15,000 monarchs usually show up at Camp Pendleton," says David 
Marriott, founder of the Encinitas-based Monarch Program, which studies the 
insect's migration. "This past winter, there were about 1,000. I was shocked; 
the drop was so drastic." 
</P>
<P>
 Scientists have no solid explanations, but Marriott is looking at the role of 
a protozoan spore that has infected up to 60% of monarchs at several of the 
state's 250 wintering sites. The spore lives on milkweed, a favorite food of 
monarchs. Once ingested, it attacks the butterfly's wings and exoskeleton and 
can turn a chrysalis, which in a healthy monarch resembles a gold-speckled 
green bullet, into a pallid lump. Marriott is testing the effectiveness of 
spraying tetracycline on the milkweed, hoping that monarchs that munch on the 
antibiotic-laced plant will be able to resist the spore. 
</P>
<P>
 But Marriott is hoping that the decline is merely cyclical. "I would think 
monarchs have pretty much bottomed out," he says. "I think they'll start rising 
again." R. Daniel Foster

HEATHER TOM: 'YOUNG' AND FOCUSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY M. REICHARDT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Heather Tom, who plays Victoria Newman Howard, has come a long way since her 
1991 debut on "The Young and the Restless." Fifteen years old at the time, she 
was tossed into the show's mainstream story line as the only daughter of Genoa 
City kingpin Victor Newman (Eric Braeden) and his ex-wife, Nikki (Melody Thomas 
Scott). 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Tom won a Daytime Emmy as outstanding younger actress. This year, 
she was nominated in the same category. Being nominated for the second time in 
as many years has been a thrill for the actress. "It's a wonderful honor," she 
says humbly. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom displays extreme modesty when discussing her craft and skill. She isn't 
one to boast or gloat about her acting ability. In fact, she rarely -- if ever 
-- watches her own work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just can't watch," she says. "I pick myself apart about silly little 
things. I might not like my makeup or hair or the intonation in my voice. 
Sometimes I'll watch a scene and say, 'Oh God! I didn't nail that right. I 
think a lot of people are like that -- hypercritical. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every once in a while, when I tape a show that feels good, I'll watch just to 
see how I've done. I know that if I like it, then it's probably pretty good, 
because I don't like anything!" she says with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the work she has liked recently have been her spats with her on-screen 
mom, Thomas Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love working with Melody," boasts Tom. "And I love our mother-daughter 
fights. They're so much fun. Melody kind of gets this crazy look in her eye 
when we're doing them, and it's like, 'whoa.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Tom has also enjoyed playing the many twists and turns of the Cole 
Howard/Victoria romance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very interesting the way the writers wrote that," she says. "They gave 
Cole (J. Eddie Peck) and Victoria chemistry without giving away their story 
(plans for the couple) right away. I thought it was very cool how they 
eventually came together. Fans seemed to like it, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Off-screen, Tom's love life with actor Chad Allen of CBS' "Dr. Quinn, Medicine 
Woman," has been the subject of numerous tabloid articles. Responding to the 
rumors, Tom says: "We're friends; we date and we have a great relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides work and attending college, there is barely time for anything else in 
this 18-year-old's life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm taking extension courses at UCLA," she says. "The average age 
(of my classmates) is 35. So it's not really like going to school. I'm taking 
classes. It's not like I'm in college, just because I don't do any of the 
sorority things or the college parties. When I go to school, I want to wear 
sweats and no makeup, pull my hair back into a ponytail and work." 
</P>
<P>
 A devoted student, Tom prefers concentrating her efforts on her studies -- 
particularly writing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Writing is kind of a cathartic experience for me," she says. "I have so many 
stories running around in my head. It's nice to put them down on paper and get 
credit for them." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Young and the Restless" airs weekdays at 11 a.m. on CBS.

STYLE: INTERIORS; THE INNER SANCTUM; AT HOME IN A WORLD OF ONE'S OWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Barbara Thornburg

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Painted scarlet, paprika and pimento, the living room inspires passion. For 
restful dreams, the bedroom comes in three shades of blue. With a paintbrush 
and furniture of his own creation, Juan Fernandez, a native of New York's 
Spanish Harlem, has turned his Silver Lake house into "a place that is totally 
safe -- my own world." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's depressing outside, the house's colors lift me up," says the 
38-year-old actor, a former model and protege of Salvador Dali. Like the 
surrealist master, Fernandez has adorned his home with curious objets -- an 
outdoor cupid fountain holds a Mexican sombrero, electrified glass grapes glow 
amid a nest of pine cones and metal roses snipped from candelabra grow on the 
dining room walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez designed his own wrought-iron furniture and decorated circus-tent 
fabric with mirrors and crystals from old chandeliers for draperies. "Dali 
taught me self-expression," Fernandez says. "Most people are afraid to reveal 
themselves. Houses should reflect who you are." No Gray Areas 
</P>
<P>
 Practically every inch of this former Hollywood printing factory swirls with a 
black-and-white motif -- the harlequin-tiled floor, the geometric-patterned 
dhurrie carpets, the calfskin-clad furniture. Even the piece de resistance, a 
three-panel screen that separates two living rooms, is painted with exotic 
salt-and-pepper flamingos. 
</P>
<P>
 "After working with colors all the time, black-and-white is very soothing to 
me," says Tony Moses, a 45-year-old interior designer whose clients have 
included Grace Jones, Phylicia Rashad, Lionel Hampton and Charles Dutton. Moses 
framed a gallery of black-and-white family portraits and hung them against a 
startling lilac background, one of the home-studio's few accent colors. He 
continued the two-tone theme in the kitchen, where shelving holds neat stacks 
of black-and-white baked-enamel pots and pans, cups and saucers, trays and 
plates. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally trained as a cabinetmaker, Moses earned a bachelor's degree in 
interior design at the Maryland Institute College of Art and opened his own 
firm in Baltimore. Later, he worked as home design editor for Essence before 
trading New York ("Living there became such a hassle.") for Los Angeles five 
years ago. The move, Moses says, has meant a lifestyle change with pros and 
cons: "Life has become so violent; mistaken identities can make you dead. Here, 
I can tuck myself away and escape from reality." A Pet Project 
</P>
<P>
 Fantastic forms sprout from the walls of this sixth-floor studio apartment 
north of MacArthur Park. What are they? "That's open for interpretation," says 
their creator, Steven Corvelo. An elementary school teacher turned artist, he 
describes his home as a "living fantasy." Huge worm-like shapes snake from the 
ceiling and through doorways, a giant octopus-like form hovers above the 
kitchen table and a pair of ostrich-like creatures with toy Ford Mustangs for 
beaks -- Corvelo calls these "LAnimals" -- emerge over the kitchen counters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my first apartment by myself, so I could do anything I wanted," says 
the 32-year-old UCLA fine arts graduate. A fascination with Southern 
California's palm trees and cars helped Corvelo shape his private menagerie, 
which took three years to paint and sculpt from papier-mache and plaster. 
Currently, he's weaving his LAnimals and red angels into a children's story 
that he hopes will someday become a movie. "I made virtually everything here," 
Corvelo says, pointing to the sculptures, tables, lamps and other revamped 
items purchased from used-furniture stores, yard sales and flea markets. "I 
wanted it to be like nothing else."

ALL THAT SIZZLES; DEEP-FRIED CATFISH, CHINESE RAVIOLI, SHIITAKE SALAD: JUST 
THREE REASONS WHY SHIRO SHINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By S. Irene Virbila 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 My friend showed up on my doorstep tired, a little grumpy and suffering from 
jet lag. I realized a change of dinner reservations was in order. On another 
occasion, despite the cramped tables and excruciating noise level, she would 
have loved Patina's richly complicated food. But not tonight. Campanile? She 
was lunching there the next day. Citrus? I considered it. And then I remembered 
Shiro in South Pasadena, where I had had a very good meal the month before. The 
room is simple and quiet, the food light and fresh. And the sizzling catfish is 
even better than Chinois'. 
</P>
<P>
 On weeknights, South Pasadena has none of the Westside's or even Old Town 
Pasadena's buzz, yet every one of Shiro's 50 seats seems to be taken or 
reserved. The restaurant's spare good looks are accented with a few abstract 
paintings in vivid colors. And the gray leather-and-steel chairs actually turn 
out to be comfortable. A shattered glass wall between the dining room and the 
kitchen refracts the restaurant's name spelled out in fuchsia neon. Shiro is 
short for owner-chef Hideo Yamashiro, who came to Los Angeles from Japan 25 
years ago to work at Benihana. Seven years ago, after stints at several 
restaurants, including Ma Maison under Wolfgang Puck, he finally opened his own 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 The menu, which changes frequently, offers half a dozen appetizers and about 
the same number of main courses and desserts. At first glance, it doesn't seem 
particularly exciting or taxing. Descriptions are short and to the point: goat 
cheese salad with pine nuts, Mexican shrimp with caper sauce, Canadian sea 
scallops with a ginger-and-lime sauce. We ordered absent-mindedly, more intent 
on visiting than zeroing in on the menu of a lifetime.  
</P>
<P>
 While my friend talked, I sneaked a look at the wine list. Whites far 
outnumber the reds. I was considering the sparkling Scharffenberger Blanc de 
Blanc from the Anderson Valley ($22) or a crisp 1992 Gewurztraminer from 
Domaine Weinbach in Alsace ($21) when I spied the '91 Chardonnay from Long 
Vineyards, a tiny producer in Napa Valley. Its elegant, lean style of 
Chardonnay is well-suited to Shiro's refined, somewhat austere cooking ($36).  
</P>
<P>
 Our first courses came out swiftly; service is a strong point here. One bite 
of the chilled tuna sashimi with its tart dressing of finely chopped capers, 
gherkins and red onions in olive oil and my whole mouth came to attention. 
Taste this, I told my friend. But she was too intent on her shiitake salad. 
"For all the New York restaurants I've eaten in this year, I haven't begun to 
put a bite of salad in my mouth as good as this one," she raved. And it was 
wonderful: fat slices of warm shiitake on a bed of wispy greens tossed with 
diced tomato, bitter endive, enoki mushrooms, daikon sprouts and maybe half a 
chopped walnut. The walnut oil dressing was a model of subtlety. 
</P>
<P>
 Both dishes were deceptively simple, notable for their balance and finesse. 
Sure of himself and his tastes, Shiro doesn't feel the need to go to the edge 
every night. Instead, he cooks a limited menu of perfectly delicious food for a 
faithful clientele.  
</P>
<P>
 At the next table, everyone had an entire catfish curled on the plate. We took 
the hint and ordered the largest of three sizes. Crunchy on the outside, the 
flesh was almost custardy within. With a fine ponzu sauce and a pile of 
cilantro, the sizzling, deep-fried catfish was completely satisfying.  
</P>
<P>
 I've had a wonderful salad of smoked mussels, scallops and shrimp with peppery 
daikon sprouts and pink grapefruit, a variation on the mixed seafood salad that 
is almost always on the menu. I was also enamored of the Chinese ravioli for 
their silken dough and subtle filling of shrimp and salmon mousse.  
</P>
<P>
 The Long Chardonnay plays well against the velvety rare tuna steak, coated 
with pepper and set atop a  
</P>
<P>
 delicate Champagne sauce. The chef seems to have a knack for finding 
particularly flavorful pieces of fish, whether California king salmon, New 
Zealand snapper or Pacific whitefish. But it's becoming increasingly hard to 
find great seafood, he contends, because waters all over the world are so 
polluted.  
</P>
<P>
 He has a few non-fish items on the menu, too: delicious lamb chops marinated 
in garlic and mint and grilled, or rare Sonoma duck breast sliced and fanned 
out on the plate with a suggestion of raspberry sauce and, often, a charbroiled 
chicken with a Provencal herb sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiro is the dessert chef, too, turning out very good renditions of apple 
tart, raspberry creme brulee and lemon mousse tart. A dark, tender chocolate 
mousse cake comes with vanilla ice cream and a marvelous mocha sauce. But for 
me, the ideal ending to a Shiro meal is his deep- fried won-ton skins, topped 
with caramelized pears and layered with berries and a refreshing orange creme. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven years cooking day in, day out in his own kitchen has only honed Shiro's 
skills. Where other chefs might grow restless in the same role and feel the 
need to open another restaurant or revamp the menu, he keeps his eye on the 
prize: consistent quality and a faithful clientele.  
</P>
<P>
 Shiro, 1505 Mission St., South Pasadena; (818) 799- 4774. Dinner only. Closed 
Mondays. Parking on the street or in a nearby lot. Beer and wine. Dinner for 
two, food only, $44-$62. Corkage , $8.

 Wine comments have now been incorporated into the restaurant review. We've 
also changed some of the information at the end of the review.Unless otherwise 
noted, we assume that restaurants accept major credit cards and offer valet 
parking and a full bar. Since most restaurants are open daily for lunch and 
dinner, we will list only the exceptions.

STAGE WATCH: THEATRE LA PRESIDENT SOUNDS UPBEAT NOTE AT CONFERENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DON SHIRLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two years ago, when the first West Coast Theatre Conference was incorporated 
into ShowBiz Expo, an entertainment industry trade fair, it kicked off with a 
keynote jeremiad from Susan Loewenberg, a producer who had abandoned staged 
drama for radio drama. She warned that L.A. theater was in crisis, and she 
offered little hope of improvement. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 edition of the same conference substituted a keynote panel for a 
keynote address. But this year's version -- held last weekend at the Los 
Angeles Convention Center -- featured an upbeat speech by Theatre LA President 
Barbara Beckley that could hardly have been more different from Loewenberg's. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like North and South Korea," observed conference organizer Sheldon 
Metz, who added that he certainly preferred Beckley's optimism to Loewenberg's 
gloom and doom. 
</P>
<P>
 Beckley, who also runs the Colony Studio Theatre, disputed a series of 
unfavorable "myths" -- "that L.A. is going to hell, that we can't be a theater 
town because we're too spread out and it's all mostly just showcase anyway, 
that there's no major talent here, that Los Angeles Theatre Center is dead and 
we'll never have mid-sized houses, that the audience is finite and our 
disasters have done us in." 
</P>
<P>
 Rebutting the idea that too much L.A. theater is simply a showcase for the 
movie and TV industries, she referred to "scores of companies that exist 
entirely because they want to create interesting new work or contemporary 
reinterpretations of the classics." 
</P>
<P>
 After several weekends of buying out-of-town papers and checking their theater 
listings, Beckley said it was obvious that there are more productions in L.A. 
than in New York, Chicago or San Francisco. "New York may have bigger theaters 
and larger audiences, and Chicago may get more respect -- but we have more 
productions, more variety, more choice." 
</P>
<P>
 She praised the municipal managers of the LATC building and urged producers 
seeking a space to make LATC "their first call." Citing efforts by Actors 
Alley, Glendale authorities, Audrey Skirball-Kenis Theatre and Actors' Equity 
to encourage mid-sized theater production, Beckley predicted that mid-sized 
theater will be "the Next Great Wave." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that Beckley found everything hunky-dory. "The days of governments giving 
tax dollars to support art for art's sake are over," she declared, "so we we 
should stop wasting time and energy rending our garments about it" and instead 
"give the politicians ways to justify spending those dollars on us" through 
revitalized neighborhoods, upscale customers, community identity. She talked at 
length about the importance of extending extra courtesies to audiences as well 
as doing "good work." 
</P>
<P>
 The idea that the audience is finite "is just a crock. . . . There are 
millions of people in L.A., most of them potential theatergoers. We just have 
to find them, cultivate them, turn them into theatergoers and keep them coming 
back." 
</P>
<P>
 GNU ON FILM: It might be interesting to hear Beckley's reaction to "Rave 
Review," the first fictional feature film within memory that's set primarily 
within the L.A. theater scene. The movie will be unveiled locally Friday at two 
screenings during the AFI Film Fest at Laemmle's Monica 4-Plex. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Seymour's movie takes off from his own experiences running the Gnu 
Theatre in North Hollywood. His 99-seat theater in the film is called the Gnu, 
though in fact its theater scenes were shot at the Melrose Theatre in Hollywood 
(the real Gnu has since become the Odessa Theatre). Some of the actors who 
performed in Seymour's productions at the old Gnu are in the movie, including 
Ed Begley Jr. and Joe Spano -- who play two stars who deign to do sub-100-seat 
theater, then desert after one weekend in order to take movie jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, this film is no documentary about sub-100-seat theater. As the AFI 
program notes, its plot veers in the direction of "The Player" -- especially 
after a disreputable L.A. Times critic shows up in the story. 
</P>
<P>
 WESTWOOD WATCH: When UCLA bought the Westwood Playhouse last year, the target 
date for UCLA-produced professional theater there was the fall of 1994. But now 
Gilbert Cates, UCLA dean and Westwood artistic director, is aiming for the fall 
of 1995, citing fund-raising problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he has taken the first steps toward taking over the theater. 
Eric Krebs, the New York-based producer of Westwood programming for nearly five 
years, has departed, and Cates has hired Lou Moore as the theater's new 
managing director. 
</P>
<P>
 During the coming year, UCLA will continue to book commercial productions into 
the theater in an attempt to make a little revenue before it becomes a 
nonprofit house. Moore hopes a show will be up by September, and she also hopes 
to reactivate the building's restaurant and gift shop.*

 * * Norman Brown, "After the Storm," MoJazz. If musical styles were 
copyrightable, George Benson could sue the shirt right off Brown's back.The 
guitarist plays Benson-like, no-problem R&B-ish tunes, and has all but Xeroxed 
Benson's bold, bronze tone (including his employment of ringing octaves a la 
Wes Montgomery) and his flowing, no-bumps-on-these-edges lines. He even hums 
along on a few solos as Benson does. On a few numbers, such as the down-homeish 
"Trashman" and the airy "Acoustic Time," Brown reveals some decidedly needed 
individuality.

baritone sax soloist, Cuber extends himself here playing tenor and alto saxes, 
flute and composing/arranging most of the charts, which have a generally Latin

 * * 1/2 Charles Lloyd, Cedar Walton, Buster Williams, Billy Higgins, "Acoustic 
Masters I," Atlantic. This is a quartet of masters and everything they do here 
-- four of the eight selections are from saxophonist Lloyd with one each from 
pianist Walton, bassist Williams and drummer Higgins with an obscure Thelonious 
Monk tune thrown in for good measure -- is executed in masterly fashion, both 
individually and collectively.What's missing is a sense of purpose. Though 
Lloyd's tenor retains its fine, inquisitive character, the overall effect falls 
short when compared to the explorative, often mystical direction carried by the 
saxophonist's own group. What's left is a swell supersession that smacks of 
marketing rather than artistic aspirations.

 * * * Sergio Salvatore, "Tune Up," GRP. Salvatore's first album, recorded when 
he was 12, marked the remarkable arrival of a prodigal new jazz pianist.Now 13, 
his second outing iseven more of a revelation. That Salvatore can swing hard is 
stunningly apparent on pieces such as "Autumn Leaves" and "Au Privave." Even 
more impressive is the subtlety of his dynamic touch on ballads -- especially 
"Almost Home" and "Over the Rainbow" -- and a bristling duet with Chick Corea 
on "Sea Journey."

 "Tokyo Live"

 Verve

<P>
 * * * 1/2

 McLaughlin's career has been a style-busting exploration through a colorful 
array of different musical forms. But he always has been at his best -- as he 
is here -- in a small group format, blending in near-symbiotic fashion with 
players who push the envelope of his skills. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no dull moments in this brilliant collaboration between the 
guitarist, organist Joey DeFrancesco and drummer Dennis Chambers. 
</P>
<P>
 The album, recorded live at the Blue Note jazz club in Tokyo, roves 
adventurously from the blues groove of "1 Nite Stand" and the funk rhythms of 
"Little Miss Valley" to the dark, Latin contrasts of "Mattinale" and the hard 
swing of Miles Davis' "No Blues" (the only piece not composed by McLaughlin). 
</P>
<P>
 The performances are superb, filled with the intuitive interaction one expects 
from groups that have spent years together. The soloing is constantly 
provocative, and exceptionally so in DeFrancesco's heroic outing on "Hijacked," 
McLaughlin's rapid-fire note-blurring on "Mattinale" and Chambers' powerful, 
but always thoughtful percussive ramble through "Vukovar." 
</P>
<P>
 As an added fillip, DeFrancesco plays trumpet on a couple of tracks in a 
manner that effectively recalls Davis' finest work. It provides the final 
capper for an album that is, thus far, one of the finest jazz releases of the 
year.

RECORD RACK: A FULL SPECTRUM OF RAP; (***) LIGHTER SHADE OF BROWN, "LAYIN' IN 
THE CUT" ( MERCURY ) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Further doing its bit to put Latino rap on the map, Lighter Shade of Brown is 
back with a sharply attitudinal album that's as commercially accessible as 
"Sunday Afternoon," the duo's 1990 debut hit single. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps too lightweight for some, LSOB makes no apologies for being slightly 
less than hard-core -- and light in this case still doesn't stand for white 
bread.The full spectrum of West Coast rap, ranging from the gangsta lean of 
Snoop Doggy Dogg to the razor-tongued feminine perspective of Yo Yo, has some 
room for the barrio-based, bangin' rhymes of LSOB. Regional considerations 
aside, the pair wryly notes on one track: It's not where ya from . . . it's 
where ya at. Robert Guttierez and Bobby Ramirez sample a taste of everyone from 
Marvin Gaye and Cameo to Malcolm McLaren to arrive at their own beat-laden 
tableau. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious they get is on "I Like It" and "Things Ain't the Same," 
funk-flavored tracks that report on life in the age of drive-bys and 
Smith-and-Wesson logic. It's just another day in rap's ever-expanding 
neighborhood, and LSOB has one of the best-informed voices on the block. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

$50 GUIDE: SOME CHOICE PICKS FROM FEISTY TO THE REFLECTIVE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, Robert Hilburn is The Times' pop music critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The eclectic choices in this edition of the guide -- a way to keep up with 
what's exciting in pop on a budget of $50 a month -- range from a solo acoustic 
album by country legend Johnny Cash to the latest rap 'n' roll high jinks from 
the irrepressible Beastie Boys. May  
</P>
<P>
 Johnny Cash, "American Recordings" (American). Don't let pop-rock producer Don 
Was' well-intended but leaden attempt last year to revive Willie Nelson's 
stalled recording career make you wary of pop-rock producer Rick Rubin's 
pairing with another country legend. This solo acoustic collection of songs 
about sin and redemption captures the essence of Cash's artistry better than 
anything since his San Quentin and Folsom Prison albums more than two decades 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Latin Playboys, "Latin Playboys" (Slash/Warner). If you agree that Los Lobos' 
"Kiko" is one of the great albums of the '90s, this side project by members 
Louie Perez and David Hidalgo (joined by Mitchell Froom and Tchad Blake) should 
be especially appealing because it offers even more of the experimental, 
world-beat sounds that provided so much color to "Kiko." The Playboys' style 
isn't as accessible or socially pointed but offers a refreshing exercise in 
artistic imagination. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonic Youth, "Experimental Jet Set, Trash and No Star" (DGC). One of the most 
remarkable things about this New York quartet is how it has been able to avoid 
becoming cautious and self-conscious despite being worshiped for nearly a 
decade by its indie-rock peers and fans. While not necessarily better than its 
earlier albums, this is perhaps the best introduction to the band's 
consistently wry and resourceful ways. June  
</P>
<P>
 Arrested Development, "Zingalamaduni" (Chrysalis). This socially conscious 
Georgia rap collective's second album doesn't top its Grammy-winning debut, but 
there are moments -- once Speech stops lecturing -- where the group's 
commitment and ambition make Arrested Development seem a valuable fixture in 
'90s pop. 
</P>
<P>
 Beastie Boys, "Ill Communication" (Capitol). The Beasties' 1986 debut album 
seemed too good to be true -- the kind of feisty punk, metal and rap 
masterpiece that captured the spirit of the moment in ways that could never be 
duplicated. But the Beasties have carried on nicely, and this is another great 
youth party record. 
</P>
<P>
 David Byrne, "David Byrne" (Luaka Bop/Sire). Just when it looked as if Byrne 
had become bored with rock, the former Talking Heads leader returns to the 
mainstream (relatively speaking) with his most personal work ever -- an album 
that explores questions of mortality and morals with stripped-down musical 
backing as intimate and as natural as a human pulse.*

RECORD RACK: (** 1/2) HELMET, "BETTY" ( INTERSCOPE ) 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sludgy fuzz guitar now engulfs the precision thrashing of Helmet, a New York 
metal quartet that plays tight, sharp grooves with a maniacal and sometimes 
experimental urban edge. On the group's third full album and second major-label 
release, it pulls in the reins on its formerly charged pace and slows it to a 
saunter.Rather than come off as one more mean outfit from the bowels of hell 
(yawn), Helmet delivers grooves that are more melodic than menacing. 
</P>
<P>
 Page Hamilton's thin vocals -- a la Ozzy in his Sabbath days -- cut in and out 
of the grind like a wavering S.O.S. signal through stormy weather. He 
occasionally distorts his voice through megaphone-style effects, but his mainly 
unassuming tones strike few I'm-bad poses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Betty" loses a few points with Hamilton's occasional monster growls, which 
sound like voice-overs for a cartoon villain. There also isn't a lot of 
variation from song to song, making half the album enticing and the other half 
neutral down time. 
</P>
<P>
 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

POP MUSIC CHARTS: WARREN G. MUSCLES IN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the artists on the "Above the Rim" soundtrack, rapper Warren G. was the 
biggest scorer, connecting with "Regulate"--recorded with Nate Dogg--which is 
No. 2 on the Time's Southern California pop singles chart. Warren G. parlayed 
that single into a hit debut album, "Regulate...G-Funk Era," which entered the 
Southern California pop chart at No. 1. It also tops the regional and national 
editions of the rap and R&B charts. Being the brother of Dr. Dre and pal of 
Snoop Doggy Dogg undoubtedly helped give Warren G. more clout than most rookie 
rappers.

POP EYE: THANKS FOR GOING ONLINE, COURTNEY, BUT COULD YOU MIND YOUR LANGUAGE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that we know that it really is Courtney Love sending all those messages to 
fans through America Online, we're getting a rare chance to hear an artist 
speak directly to her fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike print and television profiles, there's no way in computer bulletin 
boards that your words can be tampered with, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Well. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Some America Online regulars are up in arms over the fact that some of Love's 
computer missives have been deleted -- possibly because of profanity or 
potentially inflammatory comments. 
</P>
<P>
 "When subscribers sign up, they agree to our terms of service," says AOL 
spokeswoman Pam McGraw. "They agree not to submit or display any defamatory, 
inaccurate, abusive or obscene language. Judgments about what is appropriate 
are made by forum leaders, who are not employees, but participants who want to

</P>
<P>
 Love's postings have been among the hottest items on the service. She's been 
regularly signing on using the code names CMLC (her full initials) and 
BRRRKNSTOK but has done little to hide her identity, sometimes even signing the 
notes with her real name. They can usually be found in the folders labeled 
"Hole" (the name of her band), "Cobain" and "International Pop Underground." 
</P>
<P>
 In recent notes, Kurt Cobain's widow has attacked her biological father, 
various figures in the Northwest rock underground and those who would 
capitalize on Cobain's death through quickie books and films. 
</P>
<P>
 Her complaint about her father, author Hank Harrison (whom Love refers to as 
"biodad"), stems from his going on "Geraldo" to discuss Cobain's life and death 
even though he never met the Nirvana leader. 
</P>
<P>
 Another favorite target: Slim Moon, owner of the small Olympia-based record 
label called Kill Rock Stars. Love claims that Moon owes her substantial 
royalties stemming from the inclusion of one of her songs on a compilation 
released by the company several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Moon and Harrison are America Online users as well and have used the 
forum to respond to Love's accusations. 
</P>
<P>
 Slim Moon says that he considers Love's statements about him to be both 
defamatory and inaccurate. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said I made $200,000 off a record that her husband's band contributed one 
song to and that I did not pay the royalties," he says. "Both those statements 
are false . . . and I don't think a public forum was the place to discuss it 
anyway."  
</P>
<P>
 He and Love continued the debate via private e-mail, through which he says he 
provided documentation about the royalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some samples of Love's on-line writings -- typos and misspellings 
left as she wrote them: 
</P>
<P>
 * "im home, surrounded by much needed 24 hour security . . . a new cylone 
electronic fence w sensors, a rottweiler, a german shepard and a baby chowdog 
for the bean" (describing the current home life of her and daughter Frances 
Bean Cobain). 
</P>
<P>
 * "IM LITIGATING JUST FOR FUN, THERES NO ASSETS BUT IT OUGHT TO COST YOU 
EVERYTHING YOU EVER MADE OFF KURT OR ME, THAT WAS THE LAST STRAW SLIM, YOU WERE 
NOT HIS FRIEND" (part of a message directed at Kill Rock Star's Slim Moon, who 
she says owes her back royalties). 
</P>
<P>
 * "a note to all you biographers out there; YOU ARE ALL WRITING ME THE SAME 
LETTER AND AT THIS POINT YOU ARE ALL MALE i wish i could show you all the form 
letter you are sening, the vaguelt threatening ton, the "This book WILL be 
written" platitudeand the im the guy to do it blanket statement" Steve Hochman

 ROE WAY: Remember all the criticism Madonna got from feminists who felt that 
her 1986 hit "Papa Don't Preach" was an anti-abortion message? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, guess who's contributed a new song to an album supporting abortion 
rights? 
</P>
<P>
 Bingo! 
</P>
<P>
 Madonna's "Goodbye to Innocence" will only be available on Sire Records' "Just 
Say Roe" album, the seventh and most politically pointed in the company's 
series of budget-priced sampler collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Sire general manager Howie Klein says that the album, due in stores July 19, 
is meant both to raise discussion of the issue and to provide exposure for some 
of Sire's lesser-known artists. The inclusion of the Madonna track will 
certainly increase both elements, as will the low price. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to make it so stores will sell it for about $7," Klein says. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stores might not sell it at all, though. Despite the presence of an 
otherwise unavailable Madonna song, the hot topic is expected to scare off some 
stores and chains with conservative leanings. 
</P>
<P>
 Spokesmen for both the generally conservative Blockbuster Music Plus chain and 
for Handelman, a company that buys music products for such mass merchandisers 
as Wal Mart and K mart, say that no determination has been made yet whether 
their companies will carry the "Roe" album. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on the album are songs written specifically for the topic by John Wesley 
Harding and Danielle Dax, as well as a version of "I Am Woman" by the 
Waterlillies and Belly's take on "It's Not Unusual." Liner notes were written 
by the National Abortion Rights League. Steve Hochman

 WOODSTOCK REMEMBERED: While Woodstock stands culturally as a landmark music 
and peace festival, former Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young drummer Dallas Taylor 
remembers it as a drugged-out celebration of depravity and rock-star ego -- 
with him right in the middle of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor's new autobiography, "Prisoner of Woodstock," gives the backstage view 
of the noted festival -- and it's not very pretty, with stars battling over 
time slots and underage groupies.Taylor weaves that story through his own life 
tale, notable for years of drug addiction that ultimately led to his 1990 
life-or-death liver transplant. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently, time healed more than just Taylor: David Crosby and Graham Nash 
wrote upbeat introductions for the book, even though each (especially Nash) 
figures in some rather unflattering episodes. Steve Hochman

 AND ONE MORE THING: We didn't believe it was true when we saw a press release 
about L7 member Donita Sparks being taken to the hospital for treatment after 
being "mauled by a poodle" during a recent video shoot.But a spokeswoman for 
the band says that not only is it true, but the incident will be seen in the 
video for the upcoming single "Andres." The band has had bad luck with video 
shoots -- two years ago a crane fell and injured Suzie Gardner. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, both Sparks and the poodle are doing fine.

 ** Aaliyah, "Age Ain't Nothing but a Number," Jive. Teaming a sweet-voiced 
14-year-old with salacious writer/producer R. Kelly is this album's most 
interesting hook.The record itself, aside from such groove-conscious jams as 
"Back & Forth," is pretty bland. As the mouthpiece of an adult male trying to 
express the thoughts of a pubescent girl, Aaliyah sounds trapped in an awkward 
stage. 
</P>

 New albums are rated on a scale of one star (poor), two stars (fair), three 
stars (good) and four stars (excellent).

 *** 1/2 Blur, "Parklife," SBK/ERG. Having started as one of many vaguely 
promising bandsin the Jesus Jones/EMF school, Blur has evolved into a 
distinctively intelligent, entertaining and quintessentially English pop act in 
the tradition of the Kinks, Mott the Hoople, the Jam and XTC.On its third 
album, witty social insights bounce on catchy, clever tunes, especially on the 
delightfully sly single "Boys & Girls."

 TLC's long-delayed second album will probably be delayed again. Trio member 
Lisa(Left Eye) Lopes may be facing drug and arson charges stemming from the 
fire that destroyed the Atlanta mansion owned by her boyfriend, pro football 
star Andre Rison.A spokesman for LaFace Records says the project is up in the 
air, pending the outcome of Lopes' situation. The single, "Creep," was due next 
month with the album to follow in August.

 Ice Cube is launching a new independent record label called Lench Mob. The

Cube's last album, with an album to follow. Next will be a compilation of 
unreleased tracks by Cube and such associates as Yo Yo, Da Lench Mob and Don 
Jaguar. Cube, though, will continue to record for Priority Records. . . .

 WOODSTOCK, NOT!: Word is that Bob Dylan's appearance at the Woodstock 25th 
anniversary festival in August may see the star reunited with the Band. But 
don't look for Robbie Robertson to be there.A spokesman for Robertson says that 
the former Band leader, with chilly relations between him and drummer Levon 
Helm after some unflattering characterizations of Robertson in Helm's 
autobiography last year, has not been asked about appearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Robertson is keeping busy, though. Having moved to Capitol Records from Geffen 
along with new Capitol President Gary Gersh, Robertson is putting the finishing 
touches on his first album for the label -- a soundtrack for the documentary 
series "The Native Americans," featuring a collection of native performers from 
across North America. Robertson is also co-writing songs with Eric Clapton for 
a 1995 album by the English guitarist that Robertson will produce. Steve

 DOG DAY: When Bay Area punk band Green Day's major-label debut album, 
"Dookie," hit the gold sales mark of 500,000 copies, Reprise Records decided to 
mark the occasion with an advertisement in the music trade magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 The ad congratulates the band "on selling a ----load of Dookie" and shows 
three anthropomorphic dogs smoking hand-rolled cigarettes and looking somewhat 
confused. 
</P>
<P>
 Billboard ran the full-page ad, as did the often tongue-in-cheek trade 
magazine Hits. But Variety refused, according to sources at Warner Bros. 
Records -- not because of the language, but because of the drawings of dogs 
getting high. Variety editors didn't want to encourage drug use, the sources 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's absolutely ridiculous," said Jeff Gold, senior vice president of 
creative services for Warner Bros. Records, of the trade paper's refusal to run 
the ad. "It doesn't reflect any kind of reality. I've never seen dogs walk on 
their hind legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think (Variety) is read by impressionable youth," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Variety advertising account executive Mike Evans, who handles the Warner Bros. 
account, said that the only person authorized to comment on the matter is 
President Jerry Byrne, who was out of the country and unreachable. 
</P>
<P>
 The label is preparing a "censored version" of the ad, according to Gold, that 
will have black bars over the "cigarettes," as well as an asterisk in place of 
a vowel in the choice word. Robert Levine

 Writer-director Nora Ephron's terrifically popular 1993 release is a real 
charmer, a romantic comedy about an ultimate long-distance relationship.The 
"Sleepless" lovers -- Tom Hanks as Sam, an insomniac Seattle widower-architect, 
and Meg Ryan as Annie, a Baltimore journalist -- not only live in different 
cities on different coasts, they don't even know each other. They connect 
through a national call-in radio show. Ephron's quick-quip take on talk-radio 
make her film contemporary, but she also returns us to the great days of the 
American romantic comedy. With Ross Malinger as Sam's tug-at-our-hearts son, 
Jonah. (Showtime Sunday at 8 p.m.; Saturday at noon and 8 p.m.) Michael

 Written by J.T. Allen and directed by Roger Young, this 1993 TNT version of 
the storied Apache chief who died in 1909 is told solely from his own 
perspective. We first meet him in 1905 as an old man (Jimmy Herman), a virtual 
prisoner of war held in Florida and still a celebrity artifact wrapped in his 
own legend.As a teen-age horse thief he is played by Ryan Black, as a vengeful 
mature man by Joseph Runningfox (pictured). The film never provides context for 
the Mexican army's anti-Apache violence but does a better job explaining the 
Apache-U.S. conflict and the dishonorable motives behind the government's exile 
of these Native Americans to miserable reservations. (TNT Sunday at 9:30 p.m.)

 This enjoyable 1992 release might be more aptly titled "Francis Coppola's 
Dracula," for Coppola brings to the umpteenth retelling of Stoker's 1897 novel 
the grand operatic style of his "Godfather" movies -- plus considerable 
sensuality and affectionate tongue-in-cheek play.Gary Oldman (pictured) is 
suitably world-weary as Dracula, and Winona Ryder (pictured) his winsome 
principal victim. The starry cast includes Anthony Hopkins, Keanu Reeves and 
most memorably, Tom Waits as Renfield, the grotesque early victim of the 
Transylvanian count. A lush period production, with Eiko Ishioka winning an 
Oscar for her opulent costumes. (HBO Monday at 8 p.m.) Kevin Thomas

WITH AN EYE ON. . .; MARCIA CROSS FINDS THE 'PLACE' TO BE IS SOMETIMES QUITE 
BIZARRE 
</P>

<P>
 In the immortal words of Dr. Frankenstein, "She's alive! She's alive!" 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, as any observer of "Melrose Place" and '94 pop culture could tell you, 
Kimberly, who died midseason, rose from the dead. And like most TV Lazaruses, 
she not only came back, she came back with an agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 As far as villainesses go, she's new and improved. Perhaps, we dare say, one 
of the most complex women yet to cross the courtyard of the Spanish-tiled 
Melrose abodes. It's not as if any other "Melrose" woman with a bad migraine 
has snatched off her own hairpiece in front of a mirror to reveal a skull 
horribly disfigured. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the same Kimberly, a physician herself no less, who went from Dr. 
Michael Mancini's guilt-ridden lover to all-out psycho. Who, in one of her last 
scenes of last season, says to her lover's wife, about her lover: "Sydney, you 
are looking at human garbage who would have run you over as soon as look at 
you. When Michael's dead, God's going to do a jig." 
</P>
<P>
 In the highly rated season finale, it appears Kimberly and Sydney have 
successfully framed Michael's sweet ex, Jane, for running Michael over with 
Jane's convertible Cabriolet. (Remember that Kimberly "died" in a car accident 
herself, driven to her death after dinner at a Marina restaurant where Michael 
had too many cocktails). 
</P>
<P>
 All of these turns of the screw surprise even Marcia Cross, who plays the 
redheaded Kimberly on the Fox series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I actually had trouble with all of that," Cross says of the business about 
becoming so evil. "I didn't like it. I didn't mind that she was crazy or going 
after Michael or that it was as a result of her medication from the accident. I 
hated that it became so random, that she suddenly not only didn't like Jane, 
but was totally vicious." 
</P>
<P>
 Cross preferred the tormented pre-accident Kimberly, the one who changed only 
after her mother flew her comatose body back East and told everyone later she 
died. "I always played her in love with Michael. She had a conscience and felt 
badly that she'd fallen in love with a married man. She was a lonely woman, a 
professional." 
</P>
<P>
 The actress pleaded with the writers about the new Kimberly. "I just wanted it 
to be justified. I asked them, 'Why are you guys writing this? Can't we be more 
specific?' " Finally, Cross says she realized, "I have no control over that." 
</P>
<P>
 But, she says, "In many ways, they were right. What they were doing is taking 
her to a place of extremity that became humorous. When I saw the script for the 
last episode, the last three shows, I was thinking, "Is that because of the 
trauma to her head, and the medication? I kept trying to relate to it. I was 
thinking, 'This is hysterical.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, she called executive producer Darren Star, and asked him, "Is this a 
comedy now?" The answer: "Yes, this is a black comedy."  
</P>
<P>
 That information, Cross says, was great to hear. Once she knew she had to 
change styles, she did so with relish. 
</P>
<P>
 With the show's newfound "hot" status, even Cross is asking friends why the 
show is so popular. "I think they just have a good time," she says of the 
show's fans. "People get to hoot and holler." Cross recently experienced this 
firsthand at a Los Angeles restaurant, aptly called Melrose Place, where she 
joined a gathering of hard-core fans for a season-finale party. "It's certainly 
made a lot of people happy for Wednesday night." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a role that's made the Massachusetts native and Juilliard grad happy too. 
It may not be exactly what she was trained for but, "I'm just having so much 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the beginning of her career, Cross balanced television parts with 
"classical" theater roles. "I saved the money I made in TV so I could do 
theater. It's always been my trade-off." 
</P>
<P>
 During the "Melrose" hiatus, she's currently at the Old Globe Theatre in San 
Diego, playing Viola in Shakespeare's "Twelfth Night." 
</P>
<P>
 Cross' first TV foray was as a "nymphomaniac paleontologist" on daytime's "The 
Edge of Night." That role led to a part on "One Live to Live," where she played 
superwoman Kate Sanders, who could speak five languages, do karate and the 
tango. Since Kimberly seems to be able to plot murder, seduce Michael, attend 
weddings and wreak constant havoc -- all while on call -- Kate was a good 
lead-in. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, the new "Models Inc." takes over the "Melrose Place" time slot for 
eight weeks. This week's final "Melrose" repeat deals with the consequences of 
Michael's involvement in Kimberly's "death." While she won't go into specifics, 
Cross assures that Kimberly will be back next season. 
</P>
<P>
 But for how long? Even Cross doesn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Melrose Place" airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. on Fox. Then the show goes on hiatus 
for eight weeks and returns in late summer Mondays at 8 p.m.

Q&A: IRIS F. KUNG: FROM TIAN AN MEN TO PBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTINE COURTNEY, Christine Courtney is a free-lance writer based in Hong 
Kong. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since the bloody suppression of pro-democracy demonstrations in Beijing's Tian 
An Men Square in June, 1989, only eight student leaders have succeeded in 
escaping from China. 
</P>
<P>
 Zhang Boli, who was on China's "most-wanted list" for his involvement in the 
student movement, was one of those who evaded Chinese authorities and escaped 
to the West.  
</P>
<P>
 Zhang's harrowing story caught the attention of a former Chinese television 
reporter -- now residing in the United States -- who returned to China under 
great personal risk to chronicle his escape route. Iris F. Kung (a pseudonym 
used by the reporter) secretly retraced Zhang's amazing journey and smuggled 
the original footage out of the country. Tuesday night's broadcast premiere of 
"Escape From China" on PBS' "P.O.V." series marks the fifth anniversary of the 
Tian An Men Square massacre in which hundreds -- a definite body count was 
never confirmed -- of protesters died. 
</P>
<P>
 Writer Christine Courtney caught up with Kung in Hong Kong. 
</P>
<P>
 What led you to make this film? 
</P>
<P>
 I met Zhang Boli in February, 1992, at a Chinese New Year party in (the East 
Coast), where he now lives. Zhang told me he was one of 21 students on China's 
"most-wanted list," and that he avoided arrest by hiding in a remote village on 
the China-Russia border for two years. He later learned that his wife had left 
him (to remarry) and that his daughter had been left in the care of a relative. 
I immediately connected with his emotional and physical struggle and wanted to 
document his story to tell people (what is happening in China) through example. 
</P>
<P>
 What does this film mean to you? 
</P>
<P>
 The meaning of this film is not only about Zhang's escape from China but also 
about the changes that are going on in my homeland. The fact that Zhang was 
able to escape and that I was able to document his journey shows that more 
independent films like this can be done. 
</P>
<P>
 What difficulties did you encounter in shooting this film in China? 
</P>
<P>
 I had to hire a new cameraman soon after we began filming, but I wasn't able 
to tell him the true nature of the project. We traveled by train and bus for 50 
hours to get to a village in Northeast China, where Zhang hid for two years. I 
began to feel more comfortable with him and eventually told him the truth. He 
said he would continue working with me because it was the first time in his 
film career that he was allowed to be creative. 
</P>
<P>
 How did you avoid appearing suspicious while documenting Zhang's story? 
</P>
<P>
 We were stopped several times by provincial government officials, but we 
explained that we were doing a film on the environment. We also got help from a 
young man and his parents who protected Zhang during his two years of hiding in 
the countryside. The young man told everyone we were his relatives from the 
city. He called me 'aunt' and he called the cameraman 'uncle.' 
</P>
<P>
 What precautions did you take to protect your sources? 
</P>
<P>
 We had no problem interviewing Zhang's family, but we did take precautions 
when interviewing Zhang's ex-wife. To avoid suspicion, I interviewed her in a 
park while my cameraman filmed from behind some bushes nearby. We also made 
arrangements for the farming family who protected Zhang to move after we had 
completed the filming. We told them never to return to that place. We hid their 
identity in the film.  
</P>
<P>
 Were you or your sources ever in danger? 
</P>
<P>
 During post-production of the film, a woman who was working with me panicked 
when I showed her a rough cut of the film. She was going to either turn me into 
the police or destroy all of my tapes. But some friends talked her out of it. 
You can't imagine how nervous I was and how guilty I felt about getting anyone 
in trouble.  
</P>
<P>
 How did you get the film out of the country without compromising your sources? 
</P>
<P>
 I eventually used my connections (with some Chinese officials) to get the 
tapes safely onto a plane. 
</P>
<P>
 What differences do you see in China now compared to the past? 
</P>
<P>
 I think there is a big change in people's perspective. In society, all the 
Chinese government's regulations and restrictions exist. But in the minds of 
the people, all these regulations and restrictions have virtually disappeared. 
Of course, this change has come along because of China's economic reform. But I 
still think China has a long way to go. 
</P>
<P>
 How do you feel about your film airing nationwide across the U.S.? 
</P>
<P>
 Out of 600 films, I was one of 10 films chosen. As a Chinese filmmaker, this 
is really encouraging. We had a very hard time getting into American 
television. I think one of the reasons for this is that the situation in China 
has changed and people have forgotten about the 1989 democracy movement in Tian 
An Men Square. But they should take the point of view that this film is a human 
story about the emotional, cultural and political struggle of the Chinese 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 "Escape From China" airs Tuesday at 10 p.m. on KCET and 10:30 p.m. on KPBS.

ESPN'S PARALLEL 'LINES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 If the world of sports reflects the best and worst in us outside the arena, 
where can a fan or athlete look to for guidance? ESPN is the not-so-obvious 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a lot of problems or issues in society that are exemplified in 
sports, and that's what we're trying to look at," says Bob Ley, the host of 
ESPN's "Outside the Lines." 
</P>
<P>
 Since it first appeared in 1990, the acclaimed documentary series has tackled 
some of the prickliest issues surrounding today's multimillion-dollar sports 
industry. Drug abuse, sexual harassment, racism and gambling are but a few of 
the controversial topics that have been explored by "Outside the Lines." The 
program subverts the view that sports are found in the toy department of life, 
and that they don't reflect a larger reality. 
</P>
<P>
 "Outside the Lines" is the only national TV sports program to concern itself 
mainly with the sociological dimensions of athletics. It is known for stirring 
healthy debate as well as causing some of those in and around sports to run for 
cover. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did a segment that was included in our program on coaching," recalls Ley. 
"Everything was peaches and cream until this particular organization found out 
it was 'Outside the Lines.' The voice on the other end of the phone said, 'Is 
that the show hosted by Bob Ley?' When the producer setting up this particular 
interview said, 'yes,' the whole dynamic instantly changed. When that happens 
all of us at the show take a little perverse pride that we have that kind of 
recognition factor." 
</P>
<P>
 In that program on coaching, Ley and his staff produced a segment on former 
University of Florida swim coach Mitch Ivey. They investigated allegations of 
sexual harassment involving Ivey and members of the women's swim team and also 
looked into allegations predating his tenure at Florida. When the university 
found out about Ley's piece, it mounted its own internal investigation. 
Administrators dismissed Ivey two days before the show aired. 
</P>
<P>
 "The shorthand out there is 'Oh, "Outside the Lines" got a coach fired'," 
states Ley. "But that's not true. The University of Florida fired their coach. 
They asked their own questions when they learned of our investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 The recipient of three sports Emmy Awards, "Outside the Lines" first appeared 
in 1990 with two shows. Now with a larger staff and viewership in place, the 
program's producers have already aired four shows this year with as many as 
four more to follow before the end of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 For Ley, the challenge of creating "Outside the Lines" lies in picking 
interesting topics and then presenting them in an objective way that will make 
people think. Another key to developing a quality program is to bring a strong 
human element to it, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of racism, you can commission a poll about how black athletes are 
perceived on campus by both blacks and whites," offers Ley . "But when you see 
the pain and the frustration in a person's voice when he says, 'I'm a black 
accounting major and people are always asking me what sport I play,' that says 
as much as the numbers will on a poll." 
</P>
<P>
 The show "Outside the Lines" did on racism was the most personally gratifying, 
Ley says.And it also may have been the most difficult to produce since a number 
of people approached for interviews were reluctant to discuss the issue. That 
show included a provocative look at Marge Schott, the Cincinnati Reds owner who 
was suspended by baseball for making racially insensitive remarks. In the end, 
it proved to be one of "Outside the Line's" more discussed shows. Ley says a 
woman at Columbia University even used it as a source for her master's thesis. 
But is the average fan really that interested in the sociological issues 
surrounding sports? 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys who watches SportsCenter (ESPN's popular news and highlights show) 
every night at 11:30 may not be the guys who make it a point to watch every 
single 'Outside the Lines,' " says Ley. "But I'm certain that there's a fair 
degree of crossover. I think we've been able to package these shows in a way so 
that people will see a Wayne Gretzky, Magic Johnson or Barry Bonds, who they 
would expect to see on the 11:30 show, now sitting there talking about (larger 
issues). 
</P>
<P>
 "Is 'Outside the Lines' going to draw NFL Prime Time (ESPN's coverage of NFL 
football) numbers? No. It's ludicrous to think that. Is it going to draw 
strong, healthy numbers that will give you a respectable audience? Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 Ley admits that it's tough for him to remain a fan when he's reporting on the 
many issues that surround sports both on and off the playing field. On the 
other hand, he says, he's gained a much greater appreciation for the qualities 
that athletes bring to the games they play.  
</P>
<P>
 "We did a show on winning and losing and you could see the absolute psychic 
hold winning has on people like Jim Kelly and Wayne Gretzky," says Ley. "When 
you see that and you see the hurt on the faces of the Buffalo Bills players 
when they hear people -- including people in the Oval Office -- talk about them 
being a losing team, it gives you a greater understanding of how these are a 
lot more than just games." 
</P>
<P>
 "Outside the Lines" will examine the issue of violence in sports Monday at 
4:30 p.m. on ESPN. The show will repeat Saturday at 11 a.m.

FIRST IMPRESSIONS: FLAMENCO FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three nights a week at Alegria, a new tapas bar in downtown Long Beach, a 
thick piece of wood the size of a door is laid down on the bright mosaic floor. 
John Simpson, who studied flamenco guitar with Gypsies in southern Spain, plays 
his fierce music for a while, with guitarist John Bryant joining in. Then a 
tall, dark-haired dancer steps onto the makeshift dance floor and begins to 
beat out a staccato rhythm with her fuchsia heels. The fringes of the silk 
shawl tied across her breasts whip and snap as the music carries her along 
faster and faster. 
</P>
<P>
 With this latest venture, Enzo de Muro, who also owns the Italian restaurant 
L'Opera next door, brings the flavor of Spain to Pine Avenue. Alegria's decor 
resembles more an avant-garde bar in Barcelona than the traditional tapas bars 
of southern Spain. Instead of hams hanging overhead and bullfighting posters on 
the wall, sleek little lights are suspended from an armature of interlaced 
steel pipes, and Miro reproductions are framed in joyous curves of purple and 
yellow and red. Patrons perch on high stools at either the copper-topped bar or 
a lacquered counter that dips in and out along the walls; there are only a few 
tables inside, more on the adjoining patio. 
</P>
<P>
 Alegria's "little dishes of Spain" are much more substantial than the bite or 
two they would be in Andalusia or Madrid. The idea is to order four or five to 
share with friends, then continue with several more and so on. The menu here 
includes some two dozen cold (room temperature) tapas and just about as many 
hot ones. The zarzuela de pescado (a fish soup) has a lovely intense broth 
perfumed with saffron. Marinated olives, roasted peppers and trout with fresh 
mint are all quite good. But a purist might find the sauce served with the 
meaty lamb croquettes closer to a red pepper-flavored mayonnaise than a true 
romesco. Alegria gets an A for effort, but at this point, ordering can be a 
hit-and-miss affair. 
</P>
<P>
 * Alegria Cafe and Tapas Bar, 115 Pine Ave., Long Beach, (310) 436-3388. Open 
from 11 a.m. to 2 a.m. (food served until 1 a.m. most nights) seven days a 
week. Full bar. All major credit cards. No reservations. Hot and cold tapas, 
$1.75 to $5.95. Flamenco music and dancing Thursday, Friday and Saturday 
starting at 7:30 p.m. S. IRENE VIRBILA

DUNAWAY'S DESMOND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I truly enjoyed Diane Haithman's profile on Faye Dunaway ("Norma Dearest," 
June 5). My father Stanley Kramer produced and directed "Oklahoma Crude" 
(starring her) in 1973; and next to my godmother Katharine Hepburn she's always 
been my greatest influence as an artist. I am a young actress-singer and I 
appreciate the courage and passion Dunaway brings to her work. I wish more of 
today's performers projected a "larger-than-life" image. 
</P>
<P>
 Haithman's article brought up some very important points that have long needed 
addressing. For one: Dunaway brought up the fact that great leading ladies of 
the past were "women," not "girls." Perhaps actresses in recent years have been 
afraid to be "womanly" because of the "Norma Desmond Syndrome." They don't want 
to stop working by the time they're 50. They feel more comfortable with a 
"girl" image because they want screen longevity. 
</P>
<P>
 Another important aspect: Sidney Lumet mentioned the fact that people are 
often intimidated by Faye Dunaway because of her beauty and talent. He brought 
up the stigma that exists -- many people believe if a woman is beautiful, she 
can't have any brains. I believe women are still overcoming this obstacle on 
many different levels. 
</P>
<P>
 She also brought up the issue that in Hollywood "the need to build you up is 
equaled only by the need to bring you down." The industry did that to Dunaway 
specifically with "Mommie Dearest." It was a brilliant tour-de-force 
performance she should be proud off. I believe the controversy surrounding the 
movie exists out of jealousy. Perhaps her portrayal was too good. 
</P>
<P>
 If there is any actress today who is capable of breaking the age barrier in 
Hollywood it is definitely Dunaway. She bridges the gap between the glamorous 
movie queens of the past and the contemporary leading woman. I predict she will 
be an extraordinary Norma Desmond. She will show us all thrilling "new ways to 
dream."

 There are great differences between movie and TV acting and performing 
onstage, so I was puzzled that the feature article about Faye Dunaway omitted 
mention of her magnificent portrayal of Blanche DuBois in a local production of 
"A Streetcar Named Desire" some years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the singing required in "Sunset Boulevard," the role of Norma 
Desmond is surely no more difficult than bringing to life the heroine of 
Tennessee Williams' play. Here we have a character whose behavior is less than 
admirable, yet the playwright clearly wants the audience to sympathize with 
Blanche, to understand her agony. And Faye Dunaway was able to project with 
great nuance this unstable, tortured woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunaway should be a great Norma Desmond; I am looking forward to seeing the 
play again when she takes over the role.

<P>
 Faye Dunaway is as perceptive and insightful as she is beautiful. She is so 
right in saying that Norma Desmond should be played "larger than life." Her 
interpretation promises to be great, and what's even better, she looks the 
part. 
</P>
<P>
 I am one of the few who were disappointed with Glenn Close as Norma. While 
Close is an attractive woman, it's hard to imagine her face could make her the 
"greatest star of them all" in silent pictures. Also, she plays Norma hunched 
over, like the Wicked Witch of the West, and even sweeps across the stage as if 
she's on a broomstick. Norma should be played regally, like the Queen of the 
Silent Screen that she was! 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, if she can sing, Dunaway will be a great Norma.

 Double standards are alive and well in Hollywood!

<P>
 Here you have a beautiful 53-year-old actress (Faye Dunaway) having to 
"explain" her age; who is asked to play the lead role about a woman (actress) 
turning (oh, my!) 50 and the end of her career (not a fictional story 
entirely!). 
</P>
<P>
 While you have Jack Nicholson, Clint Eastwood and Robert Redford all way over 
the age of 50 still playing romantic leads with actresses half their ages! 
</P>
<P>
 How far have we really come?

 Can you please tell me what is rebellious about faded jeans and a T-shirt? It 
is almost impossible to buy jeans that are not faded.Faded jeans are sold at 
the Gap, at Kmart, at Bullock's. The middle-aged Russian students I teach wear 
faded jeans and T-shirts (it's probably the only thing they can find to buy).

 I understand the temptation to fawn over a subject one admires, but Kristine 
McKenna could have reined in her idolatry for Keanu Reeves a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading the article, you'd never know that the overwhelming consensus is that 
acting in period movies like "Dracula" and "Much Ado About Nothing" is, to put 
it kindly, not Reeves' forte. I admire Reeves' desire to stretch and work with 
top directors, but his best work has been in contemporary stories -- "River's 
Edge," "Permanent Record," even "Parenthood." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the late River Phoenix, no other actor has been able to so deeply 
and sweetly capture the emotions of the Pearl Jam generation. But rather than 
capitalize on his truth, Moviedom has simply let him play dress-up. Now, he's 
going the stiff action hero route in "Speed." Talk about wasted youth.

GALLERY: JUST LIKE FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You may not think these people "look" gay. That's the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Andrews, a Washington Post photographer, spent two years on "Family: A 
Portrait of Gay and Lesbian America" (HarperSanFrancisco, 1994), hoping to show 
the diversity of the gay community and, yet, its ordinariness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody, straight and gay, has an image of gay people," Andrews says. 
"Maybe we think of someone in their 20s or 30s. But why not someone who's 95?" 
</P>
<P>
 And why not frat boys or an Alabama farming couple or the Digging Dykes of 
Decatur, Ill.? Or Gean Harwood and Bruhs Mero, right, whose 63-year devotion 
hasn't ended by Mero having Alzheimer's disease? And what about Rainey Cheeks, 
an HIV-positive ordained minister? Their stories and Andrews' photographs 
reveal people acting the way families act. And looking the way families look.

 Giving wealth away is a thrill, and Charles and Harriet Luckman have been 
reveling this month. This week, the opening of the Charles and Harriet Luckman 
Building was celebrated by Los Angeles Child Guidance Clinic. The clinic has 
bestowed 70 years of continuous service.

 The Luckmans donated $1.7 million to the new $9.6-million building at 3787 S. 
Vermont. It's the clinic's largest single investment in the 
Central/South-Central Los Angeles district in recent years. Also this month, 
five UCLA professors received UCLA's prestigious Harriet and Charles Luckman 
Distinguished Teaching Awards. The program was established in 1992 with a gift 
of $257,000 from the Los Angeles architect-entrepreneur and his highly visible 
volunteer wife.

 Success: Steve Gamble, retiring president of the Hospital Council of Southern 
California, starred at the tribute dinner in his honor. More than 450 raised a 
gross of $403,000, which netted $328,000 for the Stephen W. Gamble Endowment 
Fund.  
</P>
<P>
 Connie Gavin was in the spotlight. The wife of former Ambassador to Mexico 
John Gavin, and a television and motion-picture star in her own right (and on 
Broadway in "Showboat" and "The King and I"), sang to the music of Andrew Lloyd 
Webber presented by the American Center for Music Theater. Onstage, too, were 
Leonard Schaeffer, chairman of the National Health Foundation and chairman and 
CEO of Blue Cross of California, attorney James E. Ludlam and C. Duane Dauner, 
president of the California Assn. of Hospitals and Health Systems.

 Jazzing Up the Summer: So much to do at "Summer Symphony in the Rose Garden," 
the California Museum of Science and Industry's seasonal do. First, guests 
listened to legendary jazz stylist Les Brown and his Band of Renown while 
viewing the theater costume collection from the Fashion Institute of Design and 
Merchandising and strolling through the museum's latest exhibit, "Behind the 
Seas: The Science in Fashion." Then they roamed the 7 1/2 acres of roses in 
full bloom in Exposition Park en route to buffet tables resplendent with 
California Celebrations gourmet picnic baskets. Plumped up, guests then danced 
the night away under the stars.

 The Four S's: Swedish, soccer, smorgasbord, Segerstrom. The prominent 
Segerstrom family of Orange County -- Henry and Renee Segerstrom, Ruth Ann and 
Gene Moriarty, and Sandra and John Daniels -- cemented international ties this 
week by courting the Swedish World Cup soccer team at a Scandinavian 
smorgasbord. Outgoing Swedish Consul General Peter Hammarstrom was on hand. So 
were Gayle Anderson, Orange County chief of protocol, and Mona and Kent Berg -- 
he's president of the Swedish American Chamber of Commerce of Greater Los 
Angeles. Menu? Golden caviar, pickled herring, smoked reindeer, and Gustaf 
Anders' famous breads and Swedish princess cake. Elsewhere on the Social

SOCIAL CLIMES / UP ALL NIGHT: RINGSIDE WITH A STEINWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HILLARY JOHNSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Eleven months ago, pianist John Wood got tired. "I'd been working the clubs 
for years, playing on bad pianos in noisy rooms, and suddenly I just got 
tired," the jazz musician says. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the beginning of the Studio Masters Concert Series, a unique 
phenomenon that defies categorization. Wood took over an extra room in the 
Studio Masters recording studio, a family business founded by his father, Randy 
Wood, and started taking reservations. Sometimes he plays with a trio, 
sometimes a bass, and sometimes it's just him. He'll play any night of the 
week, and unless you bring a date, there's a chance it'll be just the two of 
you. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've played for just one person, or as many as 15. It's a small room. I play 
for a lot of couples. Sometimes people bring a bottle of wine." 
</P>
<P>
 There is no fixed schedule, and Wood is generally available to perform seven 
days a week. "You just have to call," he says. About half the sessions are 
recorded, and if you'd like, Wood will sell you a tape of the performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening begins with a brief tour of the studio and a little family 
history. Wood's father was the proprietor of Randy's Records in Tennessee and 
of radio station WLIC, "one of the first white stations to play black music," 
Wood says. 
</P>
<P>
 The lobby is lined with the gold records his father's Dot label garnered in 
the '50s and '60s. "They made these records in three-hour recording sessions," 
Wood says, then leads the way to a small room where the more recent gold 
records by the likes of Paula Abdul are grudgingly given wall space. 
</P>
<P>
 "These songs, on the other hand, never really happened. They're all staged. 
Multitrack recording was the death of the music I love. I like to think of this 
room as pro wrestling, while out there, that's boxing." 
</P>
<P>
 Wood's performance is as much about boxing as it is about jazz. "When I saw 
Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier, it gave me everything I got from Art Blakey and 
the Jazz Messengers. For the past 25 years boxing has been the center of my 
existence. It's the reason I was able to continue playing music," he explains. 
"My inspiration comes from fighters, not musicians. Boxing is a lot like 
playing jazz, actually. It's a two-handed activity, it's improvisational, and 
it's the ultimate form of individualism. Boxing is a microcosm of life's 
struggle." 
</P>
<P>
 The concert space is a small room, furnished with a futon couch, coffee table, 
some chairs and Wood's 1929 Steinway. Album covers of jazz greats such as Miles 
Davis and John Coltrane are tacked on the walls, and pictures of Wood's two 
children occupy a shelf beside the piano. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience on a recent Tuesday night is made up of Ralph Semien and Paul 
Tanger. Semien has been here before and brought Tanger along on his return 
visit. "I used to go to hear John play in clubs, but then he disappeared. Then 
I heard him on the radio talking about this, and I came down." 
</P>
<P>
 The program begins with "Merat," the first song Wood composed, at the age of 
15, when he was pining for an Ethiopian exchange student at his high school. 
</P>
<P>
 Between numbers, Wood pauses to shadow box a few punches and reminisce about 
the three years he spent as world champ Bobby Ciccone's sparring partner. Then 
he holds up his hands and shows you his badly damaged fingers. "I can only 
close three of them," Wood says. "It's not really a problem in playing the 
piano, but I have a hard time with car doors and faucets." 
</P>
<P>
 The last song Wood plays is his most recent composition, a tune called 
"Upsidasium" that is joyful and sweet, yet sophisticated, a fair assessment of 
Wood himself. This is probably the only place in Los Angeles where you can pay 
$10 to have someone want to tell you the meaning of life without resorting to 
palmistry.

SOCIAL CLIMES / THE BUZZ: THIS MONET PREFERS ART OF DINING

 "It's the art of eating," Lambert Monet said of his first shot at restaurant 
design, the interior of the new Eclipse (formerly Morton's) to open June 29. We 
had a brief conversation with the great-grandson of Impressionist painter 
Claude Monet. We must add that Lambert Monet would prefer us not to talk about 
his famous relative at all: "I hate it. It's so stupid, you build up a life and 
you want to be your own person." 
</P>
<P>
 Lambert and partner Henk Rijkers, based in Amsterdam and Gstaad, will also 
lend the restaurant art, since they are primarily dealers and art exhibition 
designers. But they are finding restaurants fun now too. "The colors are very 
soft," Monet said. "When you go into a restaurant the lighting has to be right, 
especially in Hollywood. A light shining in someone's face, that is not right." 
The Whites of Their Ties 
</P>
<P>
 The White House says the white-tie State dinner for the Emperor and Empress of 
Japan on Monday was the first full-dress event since the Reagan Administration. 
And it apparently caused a bit of confusion fashion-wise. 
</P>
<P>
 "The social secretary at the White House said everybody (called) to find out 
what 'white-tie' meant specifically," said Rob Singer, curator of Japanese Art 
at the Los Angeles County Museum and a confused invitee. The social secretary 
told him white-tie meant black tails, a white vest, white wing-collar shirt and 
white tie.  
</P>
<P>
 Now you know. Frankly, all we really want to know is if Lew Wasserman and Mike 
Ovitz wore rented tails too. First Lady as Honoree 
</P>
<P>
 Although it's unusual for the First Lady to make a commitment this far in 
advance, Hillary Rodham Clinton has agreed to accept the Brass Ring award Oct. 
28 at the Carousel of Hope gala, Marvin and Barbara Davis's starry Los Angeles 
fund-raiser for diabetes charities. Clinton will be honored for her work on 
health care coverage.

 CITY COUNCIL 
</P>
<P>
 * CRENSHAW CRUISING BAN: Approved a motion to close a four-mile stretch of 
Crenshaw Boulevard on Sunday nights to deter automobile cruising. Crenshaw will 
be closed from Adams Boulevard to Jefferson Boulevard from 10 p.m. to midnight, 
and from Jefferson Boulevard to the Inglewood city limits at 79th Street from 9 
p.m. to midnight. The action was recommended by the Crenshaw Boulevard 
Community Task Force, a group of local residents and business people who have 
complained that Sunday night cruisers create gridlock, noise pollution and 
littering. MTA buses, emergency vehicles, patrons of local businesses and local 
residents will be allowed access to the boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 * SPEED LIMIT INCREASE: Approved an ordinance increasing the speed limit to 40 
m.p.h. from 35 m.p.h. along Washington Boulevard between Genesee Avenue on the 
west, which is near Fairfax Avenue, and the eastern city limit near Grande 
Vista Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 * LOW-INCOME HOUSING: Authorized the city Housing Department to accept a 
$3.6-million loan to Dunbar Economic Development Corp., a community-based 
organization, to build Somerville Place, a 41-unit housing development in the 
4200 block of South Central Avenue. The plan also calls for transforming the 
Golden State Mutual office building, a landmark structure designed by African 
American architect James Garrott in 1929, into a day-care center. Most of the 
housing units will be built on an adjacent lot. Construction is expected to 
begin in August and be completed next May.  
</P>
<P>
 * SENIORS HOUSING: Authorized the Housing Department to execute a $1.2-million

begin next spring, with a completion goal of June, 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 * BLOCK PARTY: Approved the temporary street closure of 60th Street between 
Figueroa Street and Grand Avenue on Saturday from 11 a.m. to 8 p.m. for the 
annual 60th Street Block Club party. HOW THEY VOTED 
</P>
<P>
 How South-Central and Eastside City Council representatives voted on selected 
issues. * SHUT-OFF VALVES: Instructed the city attorney to prepare an 
ordinance, effective July 1, 1995, that will require all new construction of 
residential, commercial, industrial and government buildings to install valves 
that will automatically shut off main gas lines during an earthquake. The 
valves could cost homeowners up to $300 for purchase and installation. Passed 
12-3. Voting yes: Richard Alatorre, Mike Hernandez, Mark Ridley-Thomas, Nate

VOICES: NONSTOP FANATICO; LA OPINION'S SOCCER WRITER HOPES THE WORLD CUP WILL 
SPEED THE SPORT'S ACCEPTANCE IN THE U.S. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALFONSO ARIAS, Alfonso Arias, 55, has written about soccer for the 
Spanish-language daily La Opinion for nearly 30 years. He began covering soccer 
in 1965 when Great Britain hosted the World Cup. Born in Veracruz, Mexico, he 
moved to Texas at age 17, then came to Los Angeles. He played soccer and 
football until a back injury sidelined him in his 20s. Arias, a self-proclaimed 
soccer fanatic, hopes the World Cup will spark an interest in professional 
soccer in the United States, as well as propel its already-growing popularity 
among youths and amateurs. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soccer will continue to grow here and it will continue to be popular among the 
youth and college-age people in Southern California after the World Cup has 
come and gone. It's a sport that you can play easily, and you don't need a lot 
of money. But it will take time, even after the World Cup, for it to develop 
here at the professional level. 
</P>
<P>
 The big problem with professional sports in the United States is Americans 
want to make all the sports similar. Soccer is not like football or baseball. 
You can't go to a college right now and draft players like you would in 
football because the college players are not as good as the international 
players. In most countries 500 to 600 teams feed the professional teams, and 
the boys go through the ranks until they reach the very best teams. The kids 
will play 20 years before they make it to the professional teams. 
</P>
<P>
 At the college level in the United States, there is a problem with 
discrimination against Latino players. Colleges and universities would prefer 
to attract a European player and some don't like the way Latinos play. It's a 
way of thinking that is dangerous and could exclude Latino players. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, there have been efforts in the United States to change soccer. 
And this is a game that hasn't really changed in 100 years. That's important 
because any referee can go anywhere and referee a game. He doesn't need to 
speak the languages because the players will know what he is doing. 
</P>
<P>
 It will take time for soccer to take root here. And one of the biggest 
problems will be the press, because they don't give it coverage. For example, 
Mexico played the United States the other day and I only saw two small 
articles. You had 91,000 fans at the Rose Bowl, and that's a big deal.  
</P>
<P>
 And there is a lot of negative coverage too. For example, with the World Cup 
there has been a lot of talk about the hooligans of soccer, and that really 
only involves England. If you look at the teams playing at the Rose Bowl -- the 
Romanians, Colombians and the United States -- they've never really had 
problems. But on television they've made it seem as if the police really needed 
to prepare for potential problems with perhaps the Colombian team. And that 
really is a slight for all Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer is the No. 1 sport all over the world. Americans need to broaden the 
identification of soccer beyond just appealing to Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 If they form a new professional league here, they must start out attracting 
players from all over the world, including Mexico, Central and South America, 
because that can help attract fans here in the United States. An effort must be 
made to bring in more European players and Latino players until soccer takes 
root here. You need better players. 
</P>
<P>
 The opportunity the World Cup offers is for the public to see good games, and 
if the people here get a chance to see good games it could really help promote 
soccer. But if the games are bad, a game that is 0-0 and boring, it won't help 
soccer here.  
</P>
<P>
 The team that is really playing well now is Colombia. If they come to the 
World Cup and they continue to play fast football, it'll help to promote soccer 
in the United States.

CRENSHAW HIGH IS PRAISED FOR TARDY POLICY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Can anyone tell me what is wrong with Crenshaw High School demanding that its 
students be in class on time ("Crenshaw High Tardy Policy Gets Poor Grade From 
Some," June 5)? This is invaluable training for the outside world where 
punctuality is a basic requirement to obtain and hold a job. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Jacinto Rhines think he is doing his daughter a service by attempting to 
undermine the school that is trying to teach her this virtue? Will Mr. Rhines 
also file a lawsuit against an employer who fires his daughter for being 
repeatedly late to work? 
</P>
<P>
 Tardy students interrupt the educational process for everyone else in the 
class. Why aren't parents like Mr. Rhines putting their energy into teaching 
their children the value of promptness? Why don't they spend a week at Crenshaw 
High School with their children, showing them how it is possible to travel from 
Class A to Class B in a timely fashion? Better yet, show them how to be in 
their seats with their pencils sharpened and ready to learn when the tardy bell 
rings. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel it is Mr. Rhines, not Crenshaw High School, who is practicing 
"miseducation." Why is he dragging race into this? If "black kids are 
disproportionately suffering," it probably means that black kids are 
disproportionately late to class. How wonderful that the principal, Yvonne 
Noble, and the assistant principal, Yolanda Anderson (both of whom are black) 
care enough to do something about an unfortunate situation. Mr. Rhines should 
thank his lucky stars that his daughter is in a school that's doing its best to 
impact her in a positive way. 
</P>
<P>
 There's a simple message here: If you care that much about your child's 
education, make sure that she (or he) is on time to class! Then, everyone wins. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 As an educator in the Los Angeles Unified School District I have plenty of 
experience dealing with tardy students. The litigants don't understand the 
impact that chronically late students have on the educational process. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who arrive 10 or 20 minutes after the beginning of class disrupt 
learning in several ways. When they arrive late to class, the students who 
arrived on time are distracted from the lesson: I must stop teaching and change 
tardy students' status in my roll book. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, I'll have to reiterate material to tardy students covered before 
their arrival, which reduces the amount of time I have to present new 
information to the responsible majority of the class. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line: Youngsters lose hours of instructional time over the course 
of an academic school year because of those irresponsible students who arrive 
late. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the parents' attorney (Phillip Higgins) states that "black kids 
are disproportionately suffering" as a result of Crenshaw High School's tardy 
policy. Such policies must be enforced regardless of race or ethnicity and not 
because too many students from a particular group get in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Have Mr. Higgins and his clients forgotten that black students are among those 
losing a small piece of their collective education every time a teacher must 
stop to deal with a tardy student? 
</P>
<P>
 Has he forgotten that young people learn to be responsible through the 
enforcement of rules? 
</P>
<P>
 Has Mr. Higgins forgotten how consequences for failing to comply with rules 
contribute to personal growth, as students learn which behaviors are 
unacceptable? 
</P>
<P>
 Jacinto Rhines, Alexis Watson and Phillip Higgins, may I suggest that you use 
your energy to fight "real" injustice instead of interfering with a school 
system that is desperately trying to educate and socialize your youngsters. 
</P>
<P>
 ELLIOT STILLMAN 
</P>
<P>
 Venice 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Have the parents of students at Crenshaw High who are protesting the school's 
policy on tardiness and absence considered that such behavior is rude and 
inconsiderate to both the teacher and the other students in the class? 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of behavior, if not corrected in high school, is liable to continue 
when the student gets a job -- and it certainly continues (with negative 
effects) if that student goes on to places of higher education. As a community 
college teacher, I can attest to the fact that such conduct is widespread. At 
this level, students who are in school to learn become indignant when others 
casually stroll into class five to 15 minutes late, and interrupt with impunity 
whatever activity is under way. Occasional tardiness or absence is 
understandable, but habitual tardiness or absence should be corrected before 
the young adults come to believe it is acceptable behavior.

 I'm 7 years old and it's the week before Father's Day. I, like the rest of my 
classmates, am making the traditional construction-paper greeting card and clay 
ashtray for Father's Day gifts. I'm working diligently to make them as 
perfectly as possible -- but knowing all along that I won't have a father to 
give these special gifts to. I found Father's Day to be a day of emptiness and 
unfairness. 
</P>
<P>
 It's very important for a child to have a father, especially a boy. Now don't 
misunderstand me, mothers are very important and key to a boy's development. 
However, my need to have a dad was great. I wanted someone to go to the park, 
the game, play catch with and just talk to me about his experiences, thus 
making them my experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 I remember visiting my friend's home where there was a dad and wishing I could 
live in a complete family, just like in "Father Knows Best." But I also 
remember the men in the neighborhood who also took time to talk to me, help me 
fix flat tires on my bike or play with me. I guess they knew I had a void in my 
life and they were trying to do their best to fill it. They became early role 
models and mentors. 
</P>
<P>
 For many African American boys, Father's Day has no meaning because in their 
household there is no father or any other male role model. The young African 
American male existence is more fragile today than at any other time in modern 
history, due largely in part to their disenfranchisement within American 
society. As a result, our boys are joining gangs, dropping out of school, 
becoming criminals and fathering children without a sense of responsibility at 
alarming rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Now is the time for African American men to reach back and grab the hands of 
black boys and teach them what it is to be a man in our community. They need to 
learn about the dynamics of being a responsible husband, father, son and 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 I know having a father makes a difference. I was 9 years old when my mother 
remarried, and my life changed for the better. Finally, I got the balance 
needed to better understand what I was experiencing as a young man. The 
education, guidance and discipline my father gave me along with the mentoring 
of other men have made the positive difference in my life. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why I joined Black Men Reaching Back. What we try to do is fill a void 
in a boy's life and be a role model, a mentor and a friend. 
</P>
<P>
 As I spend time with our young boys, I can't help but reflect on the days I 
spent with my dad. I remember the many stories he told me, often more than 
once. No matter how many times I had heard them, I enjoyed them just the same. 
When I'm with the boys, I try to re-create that same experience for them. 
</P>
<P>
 When I sit back this Father's Day, with my wife and daughter, I'm going to 
take a moment to reflect on past Father's Days. I'm going to thank my dad with 
a prayer for the warm memories he gave me and a hope that I leave behind some 
special memories of my own.

WRANGELL-ST. ELIAS PARK OFFERS UNFORGIVING TASTE OF HISTORY; ALASKA: NINE OF 
THE 16 HIGHEST PEAKS IN THE UNITED STATES ARE FOUND HERE, ALONG WITH GRIZZLIES, 
WOLVES, WOLVERINES, CARIBOU, MOOSE, MOUNTAIN GOATS, DALL SHEEP AND FEWER THAN 
100 HUMANS.

<P>
 Here, more than anywhere else in Alaska, bigness is a trademark. 
</P>
<P>
 At 13.2 million acres, an area larger than the states of New Hampshire and 
Vermont combined, Wrangell-St. Elias is the largest U.S. national park, and 
perhaps the wildest and least-known. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of the 16 highest peaks in the United States are found in Wrangell-St. 
Elias. Established in 1980, this park could swallow five Yellowstones. 
Privately owned lands within its borders total a million acres, most of them 
set aside in the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act of 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than a hundred people live here year-round. It is home to grizzlies, 
wolves, wolverines, caribou, moose, mountain goats and its best-known wild 
denizen, the snow-white Dall sheep. 
</P>
<P>
 Here could be the tail end of the last ice age. Down the valleys creep more 
than 150 separate glaciers, a collection unmatched outside the polar regions. 
The most spacious, Malaspina Glacier, is larger than Rhode Island. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of these valleys were filled with ice, and not very long ago," 
glaciologist Ed LaChapelle said. "The cool northern climate here delayed its 
disappearance, and glaciers are receding as the great ice sheets did before 
them. So if you want a glimpse of what Wisconsin and New York were like 12,000 
years ago, you can see it here." 
</P>
<P>
 It is not entirely so, for humanity has left its traces on these mountains. 
Slow-healing tire tracks mar the alpine bowl at the top of Chitistone Pass, 
which marks the meeting point of the Wrangell and St. Elias mountain ranges. A 
scientific team in the 1960s had helicoptered in a motorcycle to speed their 
rounds to research stations. 
</P>
<P>
 To the west, the copper-mining complex at Kennicott employed as many as 550 
workers for a quarter of a century, and a suburb, McCarthy, sprang up. 
</P>
<P>
 Wonderfully empty as the pass appears now, it was once a thoroughfare for 
prospectors heading for gold fields two days north. It was part of a route that 
some called "a hideous nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most of today's travelers in Wrangell-St. Elias, I shortcut my trip to 
the gold by bush plane. From 1913 to 1915 the boomers turned Bonanza Creek 
upside down, in a time of quick fortunes and even quicker suspicions. The 
latter hasn't changed. When I arrived at the cabin of one of only two active 
miners north of the pass, I was met by a .30-30 rifle and the command: "State 
your business." 
</P>
<P>
 Grace Byrd apologized later. "We didn't go to the claim today with my husband, 
Paul, and he told me to meet any visitors with a gun." She served me a plate of 
ham and beans while her 14-year-old daughter, Blyss, stoked the wood-burning 
stove. 
</P>
<P>
 A rangy Vietnam veteran, Paul Byrd prefers wilderness to a society he believes 
has gone rotten. "This is therapy, being out here," he said that evening. "The 
gold is just a bonus." 
</P>
<P>
 Therapy began the next morning with a two-mile walk to the claim on Bonanza 
Creek. Paul squirmed into a diver's dry suit and pulled on a mask. Then he went 
head-down into waist-deep, 36-degree water. 
</P>
<P>
 After 90 minutes, Paul climbed out. "An ounce of gold is a good day for us," 
he said. "It's not much money for all the hardship, but I consider it a 
privilege to be out here. It takes a raw kind of person for this life." 
</P>
<P>
 This is no place for the Winnebago crowd. Only two roads enter the park, both 
gravel. Wrangell-St. Elias is one of 52 areas (out of 367) administered by the 
National Park Service that allows limited sport hunting in designated 
preserves. 
</P>
<P>
 In this profound wilderness, campsites don't welcome a wanderer, marked trails 
don't point the way. There are valleys that have never been walked, peaks never 
scaled. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the rugged terrain, Park Supt. Karen Wade said she considers 
Wrangell-St. Elias "highly accessible," thanks mostly to the skills of Alaska 
bush pilots. 
</P>
<P>
 Hunting guides fly clients to postage-stamp landing strips, jump-off points 
for stalking Dall sheep, goats, bears and moose. Even in the hunting preserves 
-- about a third of the total park -- sheep horns are not easily taken. The 
terrain is steep, the hazards often unexpected. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of likable, athletic sheep-hunting twins from Anchorage joined us for 
dinner one night. Next morning they headed into the hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Marty Phelps was in the lead five days later when they walked up an unnamed 
canyon, staying near a glacier wall to hide themselves from sheep on the 
opposite slope. "There was a noise," Mike said later, "and Marty turned to me 
and said, 'We'd better get out of here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Truck-size chunks calved off the glacier, tipping outward and onto the Phelps 
twins. Protected from the tons of ice by a small depression, Mike clawed his 
way free. Hearing no response to his frantic shouts and unable to move the ice, 
he raced 30 miles to a hunting camp, calling Marty's name all the way. 
</P>
<P>
 Rescuers noted that more of the glacier leaned over the break-off point, 
dangerous for digging. Marty Phelps' body remains under the shattered ice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those two did nothing wrong," said pilot Paul Claus. "This is just very 
unforgiving country." 
</P>
<P>
 Although more visitors come every year, Karen Wade feels the park's vastness 
can handle them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to develop it like a Yellowstone," she said. "But we foresee 
cooperative arrangements with private-property owners inside the park who might 
want to offer lodges, horseback riding and camping areas. The short season 
limits the number of visitors." 
</P>
<P>
 A visitor center, scheduled to open in 1998, will showcase the park and help 
hikers plan their trips. "Whatever happens to Wrangell-St. Elias beyond that 
will require a change in legislation," Wade said. "For now, we won't do 
anything to detract from its natural beauty."

RED TAPE, REALITY TARNISH SILVER-MINING DREAM, ENDING IN VIOLENT DEATH; 
COLORADO: FRIENDS, ASSOCIATES AND SUPPORTERS BELIEVE STEFAN ALBOUY WAS A SYMBOL 
-- AND A VICTIM -- OF THE STRUGGLE FOR CONTROL OF THE WEST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 All Stefan Albouy ever wanted was to be a silver miner, and this former silver 
mining center seemed the perfect place. 
</P>
<P>
 But Albouy was born a century too late. 
</P>
<P>
 Tangled in red tape, tripped up by environmental groups and government 
agencies, Albouy always seemed to fall one step shy of his dream, one permit 
short. 
</P>
<P>
 It finally proved too much. On June 5, he took the .44-caliber Magnum that he 
wore in a holster and put it to his head. He was 34. He left no note. 
</P>
<P>
 The flag flew at half staff at Albouy's beloved Smuggler Mine; a jar with 
daisies sat in the portal.  
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe it all just wore him down," said former Aspen Times editor Mary Esbaugh 
Hayes, an Albouy supporter. "Every time he turned around he was hauled into 
court." 
</P>
<P>
 Friends, associates and supporters believe Albouy was a symbol -- and victim 
-- of the struggle for control of the West, an example of how the West's 
mainstay industries of mining, logging and ranching must battle to survive 
urbanization. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who have no understanding of Colorado wanted to shut him out," said 
Rep. Scott McInnis, the Republican who represents western Colorado. "It's a 
fight for the West and he's a victim of it." 
</P>
<P>
 The son of a World War II French Resistance fighter, Albouy (pronounced 
all'-boy) was digging tunnels beneath the road by his Aspen home when he was 5. 
At 16, he began buying mining claims. 
</P>
<P>
 He and the band of volunteers who helped him were sometimes known as Peter Pan 
and his Little Lost Boys. They drove cars adorned with "I Love Explosives" 
bumper stickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact remains that I love mining," Albouy said in a 1992 interview with 
the Associated Press. "There's nothing I'd rather do." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, he acquired the rights to operate the Smuggler Mine; he hoped to turn 
the clock back 100 years to the days when the mine produced $50-million worth 
of silver. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was a different Aspen, a city transformed from an old silver mining 
town into a playground for the rich and a skiing and tourism mecca. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after getting the mine into shape, Albouy was forced to operate tours 
rather than extract ore because silver prices were too low. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he was so disappointed with the changes he saw in his home and this 
valley," said Gary Wright, his partner, lawyer and friend. 
</P>
<P>
 Albouy later picked up the rights to the Compromise Mine, located in the 
middle of Aspen Mountain, America's glitziest ski mountain. He started tours 
there this year, eventually winning the support of the ski company. 
</P>
<P>
 Albouy enlisted a dozen friends to run the Compromise. They paid dues and had 
to do work to be shareholders in the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything has started coming together," said Dominic Popish, one of Albouy's 
volunteers. "For the last eight years we had been pouring our own money into 
this and we were finally making some." 
</P>
<P>
 But the bureaucracy continued to frustrate Albouy, his friends say. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Forest Service ordered Aspen Skiing Co. to stop selling tickets for 
the tours. Officials said the sales were not part of the skiing company's 
master plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Another time, Pitkin County officials ordered Albouy to halt the tours because 
they said he needed a Forest Service permit. It turned out to be unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 Albouy tried -- and failed -- to open a marble quarry inside the Maroon 
Bells-Snowmass Wilderness area outside Aspen. He fought for years with county 
officials, filing numerous environmental reports and attending numerous 
hearings, only to have the Forest Service step in and claim jurisdiction, 
forcing him to do it all over again. 
</P>
<P>
 Albouy and his Lost Boys loved mining so much they made a pact to take over 
the shares of any member who died. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's almost like there's a renewed sense of commitment on the part of 
Stefan's family and friends to make sure his dreams are realized," Wright said.

1,000 FRIENDS OF OREGON KEEP EYE ON LAND USE, GROWTH; WATCHDOGS:: GROUP FOUNDED 
BY FORMER GOVERNOR IS MAKING SURE PLANNING LAW IS ACTUALLY CARRIED OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHARLES E. BEGGS, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 20 years ago, former Gov. Tom McCall persuaded a lawyer friend to get 
enough friends together to ensure that Oregon's newly enacted comprehensive 
land use planning law was actually carried out. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the group, which calls itself 1,000 Friends of Oregon, could call 
itself 2,500 Friends of Oregon. That's how many people contribute to and 
otherwise support the watchdog group. 
</P>
<P>
 And by 1997, if the group is successful in a new recruiting campaign, it could 
call itself 10,000 Friends of Oregon. 
</P>
<P>
 1,000 Friends, co-founded by McCall and Henry Richmond in 1975, had a simple 
premise for its existence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tom said in the founding speech the law needed a watchdog; it doesn't enforce 
itself," said Robert Liberty, who recently succeeded Richmond as the group's 
director. Richmond left to join a national planning group he formed. 
</P>
<P>
 McCall, who gained national fame of sorts as governor by urging outsiders to 
visit Oregon but not to stay, was a key player when the state passed the 
nation's first comprehensive statewide land use planning law in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Republican governor believed that putting a statute on the books was 
not enough. Hence the support group that became 1,000 Friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The law established state goals, such as preserving prime farm and forest 
lands, and required counties and cities to adopt plans conforming to the state 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The change meant land use regulation no longer was solely a local government 
matter. The law has bred much controversy, but voters have rejected several 
attempts to repeal it or water it down. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty said his group, although small, has had a large impact on the success 
of planning programs. 1,000 Friends has 14 employees, including lawyers, and 
technical experts such as foresters and clerical workers. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization has brought some highly publicized lawsuits, including one 
against attempts by followers of Indian guru Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh to 
incorporate a city on the central Oregon desert in the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar land use planning efforts in other states lag, Liberty said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love this state so much I hate to see it go the way of its neighbors," he 
said. "I have gone to California, Washington, Hawaii and Massachusetts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their land use legislation has not turned out the way the drafters thought it 
would," he said. "The big difference is the political savvy of 1,000 Friends, 
the expertise it has." 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty, 40, is a Rhodes scholar and holds degrees in political science and 
law. He was a 1,000 Friends attorney from 1981 until 1990, when he left to open 
a private law practice and do consulting work in growth management. 
</P>
<P>
 Liberty anticipates that his move will bring him a kind of satisfaction he did 
not get in private practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed being on my own, but the work was not as fulfilling," he said. "It 
does not have the same meaning as working for the public interest. Making money 
is not the same as making a difference, for me." 
</P>
<P>
 Foes of the planning law say Liberty is a daunting opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a very able, articulate and formidable advocate, which should be of 
concern to landowners all across the state," said Bill Moshofsky, executive 
director of Oregonians in Action. The group has fought state-imposed land use 
rules, especially those restricting development on rural lands. 
</P>
<P>
 1,000 Friends under Liberty will, "if anything, be more preservationist and 
more restrictive than before," Moshofsky said. "Their basic agenda continues, 
which is to outlaw virtually all use of rural land outside cities, mandate 
higher densities in cities and continue with rigid urban growth boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it's a prescription for gridlock and a lesser quality of life," said 
Moshofsky, a retired timber company lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 But Liberty said Oregon's rapid population growth makes residents even more 
aware of the need for planning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is stronger support for growth management than there has been 
in 15 years," he said.

FORENSIC ARTIST HAUNTED BY FACES OF VICTIMS; CRIME: HER GOAL IS TO 
REVOLUTIONIZE THE WAY LAW ENFORCEMENT CREATES THE LIKENESSES ON "WANTED" 
POSTERS. THAT INVOLVES REVOLUTIONIZING THE WAY ARTISTS INTERVIEW VICTIMS. 
</P>

<P>
 The faces haunt her. Not the criminals Jean Boylan draws every day, but the 
faces of the victims who guide her sketches with their painful memories. 
</P>
<P>
 There are times when Boylan, one of the country's leading forensic artists, 
would rather hang it up and try a job that's more, well, pleasant. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I'm going to continue to do this kind of work with this degree of 
intensity, I'm just going to have to find a way to withdraw," Boylan said one 
evening from her cabin in the Oregon woods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just too much. I've got to balance it with something more positive." 
</P>
<P>
 But Boylan, 40, can't stop until she achieves her goal, which is nothing short 
of revolutionizing how law enforcement officials create the likenesses on the 
"Wanted" posters that are a staple of criminal investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 She has lectured about her unorthodox methods in China, Japan, Russia and 
Central America, and visited police departments all over the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Everywhere she goes, she delivers the same message: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to find a constructive way of saying, basically, you're doing it 
all wrong," she said. "There's a better way. My idea is to get to every agency 
and teach them that this is a more complex task than anybody has acknowledged." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Boylan, the drawings that line post office walls, telephone poles 
and Laundromat bulletin boards have less to do with art than with lending an 
old-fashioned sympathetic ear. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't emphasize enough, this has nothing to do with art," she said. "This 
is all about the interview, about the brain, how it processes memory and how 
trauma affects memory. The art is not the point. The point is to get accurate 
information. It's about developing a place of safety, listening skills, 
interview skills." 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the way it is done now is that forensic artists with a 
minimum of training use a kit of photographs showing facial types. In asking 
questions about the perpetrator's appearance -- "How tall was she?" "Did he 
have a mustache?" -- they unwittingly put visions in victims' heads and words 
in their mouths. That can contaminate the victim's memory and prompt inaccurate 
descriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, in using the kit's stock features, they lose the subtle differences that 
make a person's appearance unique. 
</P>
<P>
 Boylan uses a more free-form interview technique characterized by open-ended 
questions. If a victim is upset, she brings up other, neutral topics to relax 
them. Bolstered by her calming manner, they are better able to rehash the 
painful memories that, in many cases, have been repressed or distorted. 
</P>
<P>
 It was while she was working with the Multnomah Sheriff's Department as a 
civilian investigator in 1977 that Boylan noticed something was wrong with the 
process used to make composites. The drawings the department's artists were 
producing looked nothing like the people eventually arrested, and the victims' 
descriptions of their attackers changed radically over time. 
</P>
<P>
 She decided to find out why. 
</P>
<P>
 She studied psychology, counseling and criminology at Oregon State University. 
Her focus was post-traumatic stress syndrome, coping mechanisms for sexually 
traumatized victims and how information is encoded in the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 She learned that the emotional trauma of being assaulted taints the memory. 
She discovered, for example, that victims tend to remember their attackers as 
larger than they are. And she found out that the memory is least accurate 
immediately after a crime and best two to three days later. 
</P>
<P>
 When she graduated in 1981, she signed on with the Portland Police Department. 
What followed was a succession of rape, murder and robbery cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Boylan has drawn more than 7,000 composite sketches during a 16-year career. 
She's been involved in such notorious cases as the kidnaping and killing of 
12-year-old Polly Klaas in Petaluma, Calif., and 10-year-old Cassidy Senter and 
9-year-old Angie Housman in St. Louis County, Mo. 
</P>
<P>
 Her sketches also have been instrumental in the hunt for suspects in the 
slaying of Manhattan Beach, Calif., police officer Martin Ganz; a San Fernando 
Valley serial child molester;, the Green River serial killer in Washington 
state; and other killers in Massachusetts, Oklahoma and Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 When her drawings began to yield arrests in previously unsolved cases, 
Boylan's reputation grew. When Polly Klaas was abducted from her bedroom, the 
FBI asked for her because "we'd heard she was the best," said FBI Special Agent 
Rick Smith of the San Francisco office. 
</P>
<P>
 She didn't disappoint them, according to James Nelson of the FBI's St. Louis 
office, who worked with her on the Senter and Housman cases. He was so 
impressed that he mentioned her to the higher-ups in the FBI's Washington 
headquarters. They're interested in her ideas, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She has done probably the best work I've ever seen," Nelson said. "I think 
her concept is a definite improvement."

COMMENTARY; 'MURDER AT COURTSIDE': THE NBA IS IN TROUBLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE KINDRED, THE SPORTING NEWS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I have a friend who wants to write a novel and call it "Dan Rather Makes Me 
Nervous: Murder in the Newsroom." 
</P>
<P>
 I know how she feels. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Basketball Assn. Makes Me Nervous: Murder at Courtside. 
</P>
<P>
 Events of this season, especially in the last two months, have persuaded me 
the league is in trouble. Not financial trouble, at least until the players go 
on strike, maybe sooner than later at that. But the NBA certainly is in psychic 
trouble. If I'm nervous and I get into games with a press pass, what are the 
paying customers thinking? 
</P>
<P>
 The evidence suggests they are nervous, too. Nine teams couldn't sell out 
their games this season no matter who they played or what star came to town. At 
more than one site, first-round playoff tickets weren't sold out. In the first 
round, there were no solid favorites. That's an indication of 
weakness-by-parity because there is no such strength as strength-by-strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, great teams are rare: the Celtics of Bird, McHale, Parrish and D.J.; the 
Lakers of Magic, Worthy, Kareem and Wilkes; the Bulls with the singles hitter 
from Birmingham. We've been spoiled by 15 years of rare teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But just because we've seen great ones, don't try to tell me today's NBA teams 
are bad only in comparison. 
</P>
<P>
 These teams are bad. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA is in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of trouble: It's playoff time and the little movie man gets the ink. 
And the Birmingham singles hitter gets the ink. And in one of the finalists' 
hometowns, the local newspaper declared it "CHOKE CITY." 
</P>
<P>
 The ink runs away from the basketball to the sideshows because there's nothing 
to say about the basketball except it's bad. 
</P>
<P>
 And this isn't about the fights and rasslin' and idiot chest-bumping and 
finger-pointing and trash-talking. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the basketball. Can't anybody here play this game? Is there a decent 
half-court offense in the NBA? When's the last time anybody except John 
Stockton made a decent pass three times in a night? When's the last time any 
team ran and ran and ran an offense, exhausting all the options and creating 
new options and dazzling us with inventions of the moment? 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever happened to point guards? Two thousand guys in college and there are 
two point guards in the draft, Jason Kidd and Charlie Ward, and Ward is a 
football player. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe the little movie man should suit up. Give him some of those magic shoes 
he used to sell with the singles hitter. Then he could play Reggie Miller 
head-up instead of yapping. See how he likes that. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA is in trouble not because it's rasslin' with a 24-second clock. It's 
in trouble because it has so many bad games. Good heavens, was that a man 
falling out of a revolving door? Or was it Patrick Ewing with the ball? 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks' coach, Pat Riley, has done a great job with one player of quality. 
He has taken a handful of non-entities who can jump and run and throw forearms 
and melted them down into a Mack truck. Riley's statisticians keep track of 
"hustle points" given, for example, when a defender comes running at a shooter. 
It works this way: No hustle points means the guy loses playing time means he 
loses money. Riley can coach. 
</P>
<P>
 So now Riley has done it with Magic and he has done it with Anthony Mason. 
That's good coaching, and it's not easy or everybody would be doing it. So 
Riley gets deserved credit. And Phil Jackson gets a bad case of the envies. 
Jackson won with the singles hitter and didn't win without him. So he loses his 
cool because Riley is seen as a genius with a team in the Finals while Jackson 
is out of it -- and all because of a foul called against Scottie Pippen when 
that foul isn't called twice in 1,000 games. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the NBA's troubles these days is that players mostly run the teams. If 
they don't want to practice, they don't. They're looking for ways to do it 
easier, which means doing it worse. They fly by chartered airplanes to make 
life easier. The stars and rookies get the big money; the Nos. 5 through 8 
players get the shaft, and they're the workers who win games. 
</P>
<P>
 And we haven't even mentioned Dennis Rodman yet. 
</P>
<P>
 He's on the teevee with Jay Leno the other night. 
</P>
<P>
 His hair is blond. He used to be famous for talking. He once said Larry Bird 
would be just another player except he happens to be white and so the white 
media build him up as something special. 
</P>
<P>
 But now Rodman is famous for his hair being black and then red and then blond. 
And he's on teevee saying what would it be like if he and Madonna had a baby? 
As Dave Barry says, I am not making this up. 
</P>
<P>
 The NBA is in big trouble when Dennis Rodman is the star Jay Leno wants on his 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, when Dave Letterman does a good thing and gives the funny Reggie 
Miller some teevee time, here comes the little movie man again to upstage 
Reggie. He comes out and gives Reggie -- har har -- John Starks' jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 What's it tell you about the NBA when you see Larry Bird in a space suit? He's 
selling hamburgers by playing H-O-R-S-E from outer space with the singles 
hitter from Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 It tells me the NBA is in trouble if the hamburger people think the best thing 
they can do is bring back Larry Bird in a space suit. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder David Stern, the NBA commissioner, is nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder he wanted Mike Krzyzewski in the league. Stern failed in that one. 
He shouldn't give up, though. 
</P>
<P>
 He should buy another airplane ticket to the South. 
</P>
<P>
 He should get himself down to Birmingham and talk to the singles hitter and 
make him king of the world, if that's what it takes.

AN ORIGINAL BOY OF SUMMER, THE DUKE RULED IN BROOKLYN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DICK BRINSTER, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gone are all but the memories of those majestic homers that cleared the right 
field wall at old Ebbets Field as the fans on Bedford Avenue scrambled for the 
ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Duke's up," those in the upper deck would yell to the street denizens, 
who took up positions in front of Young Motors. The management of the DeSoto 
dealership didn't mind. Who needed another broken window? 
</P>
<P>
 That seems a lifetime ago for Edwin Donald Snider, erstwhile center fielder -- 
The Duke of Flatbush. In reality, it was. 
</P>
<P>
 An era ended for The Duke, along with Pee Wee and Moonie and Campy and Skoonj, 
on Oct. 8, 1957. That's when a terse statement from Walter O'Malley -- the 
obituary of the Brooklyn Dodgers -- was quietly tacked on a bulletin board as 
the New York Yankees played the Milwaukee Braves in the World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was born in Los Angeles," Snider said last week when asked how he felt 
about the move to the left coast. "Baseball-wise, I was born in Brooklyn." 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the Duke was dead, replaced by something Californians called the Silver 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was finished as a ballplayer at 31." Snider said. "I had hurt my knee three 
times. I was never the same." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Snider, who played seven more years, was being hard on himself. But 
the numbers between 1953 and 1957 were historic. En route to a Hall of Fame 
career built on 407 home runs, Snider went deep 40 or more times in five 
consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Only fellow Cooperstown enshrinees Babe Ruth and Ralph Kiner had done that. No 
one has matched the feat 37 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 "We loved Brooklyn, and nobody wanted the leave except Mr. O'Malley," Snider 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley took the team to Los Angeles, but left its soul in Brooklyn. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't trade that experience for anything," Snider said. "You just can't 
buy that." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are Hilda Chester, the leather-lunged fan with the annoying cowbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is the Dodgers Sym-Phony, a so-called band that harassed umpires with 
"Three Blind Mice" and the opposition with "The Worms Crawl In." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the days when "Cookie played hooky to go and see The Duke," as Terry 
Cashman insists of a friend in "Talkin' Baseball (Willie, Mickey and The 
Duke)." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was different because the fans were right on top of you," Snider said. 
"You got to know them, even some of their names. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all lived in Brooklyn. We all died with Brooklyn." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that there weren't difficult times. 
</P>
<P>
 Snider once was quoted as calling inhabitants of the colorful old ballpark 
that was to meet a wrecker's ball in 1960 the worst fans in the game. He came 
to the park after the quote was published and was booed with a passion 
generally reserved for a Giant. 
</P>
<P>
 Snider soon silenced them with a few rainbow shots over the 38-foot-high 
screen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers were beaten in the World Series by the Yankees in 1947, 1949, 1952 
and 1953. This intensified the Brooklyn battle cry of "Wait Till Next Year." 
</P>
<P>
 When it arrived, in 1955, Snider starred with four home runs -- he also had 
hit four in 1952, and to this day holds the National League record for most 
World Series homers with 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice in his career, he nearly hit four homers in a game -- a feat 
accomplished only 12 times in history. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could just as easily have had four homers that day, except for the fact 
that I hit the ball so hard it went on a line into the screen, no more than a 
couple of feet from the top," Snider once said of a three-homer day in 1955. 
</P>
<P>
 It duplicated a feat of five years earlier, also at Ebbets Field. 
</P>
<P>
 Snider, who over 18 seasons compiled a lifetime batting average of .295, was a 
disciple of Branch Rickey. A wild swinger when he came up in 1947, Snider was 
harnessed by Rickey, who made him practice standing at home plate with a bat on 
his shoulder calling balls and strikes, but forbade him to swing. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to leading the NL in homers with 43 in 1956, Snider led in runs 
scored from 1953 to 1955. He drove in 100 or more runs six times, including a 
league-leading 136 in 1955, and scored 100 or more on six occasions. Between 
1953 and 1957, Snider scored 581 runs, drove in 585 and batted a composite 
.321. 
</P>
<P>
 Snider played on two World Series championship teams, the second being the 
1959 Los Angeles Dodgers. But it was never the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the 67-year-old Snider lives in retirement in Fallbrook, Calif. He is 
among the dwindling number of survivors from a group author Roger Kahn anointed 
"The Boys of Summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are Hall of Famers Jackie Robinson and Roy Campanella; and Billy Cox, 
Junior Gilliam, Carl (Skoonj) Furillo and Gil (Moonie) Hodges. 
</P>
<P>
 Snider says he discusses them with fellow Hall of Famer Pee Wee Reese. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remind Pee Wee that we are the only survivors of the regular position 
players," Snider said. "And he says, 'Duke . . . shut up.' "

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; INSTEAD OF ULTIMATE TEST, FINALS ARE BORINGLY TESTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One day (soon), the 1994 NBA finals will mercifully be forgotten, remembered 
only as the bridge between the Michael Jordan era and the new 
anti-game-of-force rules. 
</P>
<P>
 If the New York Knicks and Houston Rockets are models of work ethic, digging 
down deep, etc., aesthetically it's been like watching pigs push a ball around 
the barnyard with their snouts. 
</P>
<P>
 And that isn't even the scary part. 
</P>
<P>
 More than style, the NBA was built on personalities, big, open, colorful, 
generous-spirited ones like Julius Erving, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and the 
pre-scandal Jordan, men who didn't act like they hated being stars. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before rookies got $50 million contracts and sneaker endorsements 
before they'd been in a pro layup line, before coaches started feeling the 
pressure and circling the wagons. 
</P>
<P>
 This series is emblematic of the modern NBA with personalities that have been 
muted, if not outright repressed. The Rockets are dull. The Knicks are Stepford 
wives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks have a p.r. department that, for budget, hustle and sheer energy 
ranks above anything in pro hoops and perhaps any other sport. At home, their 
efforts are richly rewarded. Even in the rough-and-tumble tabloid world, it's 
rare that a month goes by without some story about how the guys at Madison 
Square Garden sent some Knick paraphernalia to a kid in a hospital who is now a 
fan for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one thing holds the p.r. department back -- the team. 
</P>
<P>
 A Knick media session at the finals goes this way: 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing, a pleasant man who was taught in college to protect himself at 
all times and now rarely grants off-day audiences, has to attend by league 
rule, talks briefly, then sits by himself for the last 15 minutes of the 
30-minute session. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles ("I'm a true warrior") Oakley talks at length, possibly because he's 
coming off a 16-point, 20-rebound game. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Knicks' Oscar the Grouch is upset as usual. At one time or 
another, Oakley will complain he gets too little playing time, too few shots, 
too little publicity, too little help under the boards, isn't appreciated and 
has had to wait too long for his $2 million-a-year contract to be renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd like to lay it all out but doesn't want to incur the wrath of Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Today Oakley issues a vague complaint that the Knicks once "dissed" him: "I 
don't hold grudges but they know what happened between me and them . . . . It 
wasn't right." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed as to the nature of the dis, Oakley rises and walks off, muttering: 
"I'm outta here." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Mason, carrying on with a bunch of teammates, says he isn't talking 
any more  
</P>
<P>
 At least three guys are saying that next game they have to "come with more 
force," parroting Riley's new pet phrase. Riley got it from assistant coach 
Dick Harter, who used it all the time during his reign of terror at Oregon 
before taking his force to Detroit where he taught the Pistons how to be Bad 
Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to believe these sessions were once fun, not inquisitions. To the 
Knicks, they're a grim chore. 
</P>
<P>
 David Stern no longer brags about the graciousness of his stars but hasn't 
addressed the problem. As long as the guys do the basics -- smiling for the NBC 
cameras -- how bad can things be? 
</P>
<P>
 Check the finals ratings, which have dropped to their lowest level since 1990, 
before Jordan hit the big time. That's how bad. ROLLING THUNDER: THE '94 
SHAKEUP 
</P>
<P>
 There has never been anything like this off-season. So far, the count is seven 
administrators fired, resigned or on leave, plus seven head coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an update: 
</P>
<P>
 LAKERS -- Del Harris replaced Magic Johnson who replaced Randy Pfund. 
</P>
<P>
 CLIPPERS -- They deny it but there are reports that no sooner had Donald T. 
Sterling finished saying, "We're going to keep Danny Manning," then he started 
in on "Can we get Larry Brown back?" Answer: no. The new hope is George Karl 
but he's under contract and the Sonics don't want to give him up. 
</P>
<P>
 SONICS -- They're close to a deal with departing GM Bob Whitsitt who may 
alight in Portland. Karl wants out but will probably have to settle for another 
raise. Says new Sonic president Bill (son of owner Barry) Ackerley: "I keep 
asking, why because Bob Whitsitt had a contract problem does George Karl have 
to create a contract problem?"  
</P>
<P>
 CELTICS -- Dave Gavitt built the Big East but was more at home with network 
execs than NBA GMs, sat on his reputation and got kicked upstairs by new owner 
Paul (son of old owner Don) Gaston. Larry Bird, who likes playing golf in 
Florida, turned the job down so the desperate Gaston bumped up untested but 
popular M.L. Carr, who had been in the community relations department, a silly 
p.r. ploy that fooled no one. Everyone wonders why Red Auerbach is sitting 
still for this but Red's horses were Gavitt and Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 PISTONS -- Isiah Thomas handed his long-time sponsor, owner Bill Davidson, a 
list of demands to stay: a $50 million chunk of the team plus operational 
control. Isiah then told the newspapers that Davidson agreed, whereupon 
Davidson slapped Thomas on ice. Isiah bolted for Toronto, where he'll become 
GM/minority owner. 
</P>
<P>
 WARRIORS -- New Spurs GM Gregg Popovich, until recently Don Nelson's 
assistant, is the latest to court Nelly who has one more season before he has 
an out in his contract and the rumors really start flying. 
</P>
<P>
 HORNETS -- Owner George Shinn wants an assistant coach to help (read: shore 
up) Allan Bristow. Jack Ramsay turned him down so the Hornets are choosing 
among Grgurich, Boston's Don Casey, ex-Bull Johnny Bach and ex-Clipper Bob 
Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 NETS -- Howard University Coach Butch Beard, an old Willis Reed favorite, is 
the frontrunner to succeed Chuck Daly, ahead of Derrick Coleman's candidate, 
Paul Silas. This would be an imaginative choice for Reed if he can get the 
Seacuacus Seven to go along. As usual, they're split. 
</P>
<P>
 76ERS -- John Lucas succeeds GM Jim Lynam and Coach Fred Carter. As usual, 
owner Harold Katz makes his "It will be -- -- -- -- -- 's show" speech. 
</P>
<P>
 BLAZERS -- Super-rich computer dweeb Paul Allen staged his long-awaited purge, 
fired Coach Rick Adelman, pursued Mike Krzyzewski and Nolan Richardson but now 
is down to interviewing . . . . Bob Hill? Hill was the Pacer coach before 
Brown, the guy who showed what you couldn't do with that team. 
</P>
<P>
 KINGS -- Blazer GM Geoff Petrie, well-liked and respected, landed here. Droll, 
unlucky but so-far bulletproof Jerry Reynolds remains as personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
 BULLETS -- Lynam, an old friend of GM John Nash, becomes coach, replacing 
owner Abe Pollin's old favorite, Wes Unseld. 
</P>
<P>
 SPURS -- Disaster area. New GM Popovich is expected to coach if he can't get 
Nelson or Karl but the problem is, five years later, they still haven't found 
one good young player to go with David Robinson. New owner Robert McDermott, an 
insurance millionaire who was once a one-star general in the Air Force and 
likes to be addressed as "General," sacked GM Bob Bass and chased off Lucas who 
realized he was in an impossible position between uncontrollable Dennis Rodman 
and a clueless owner. One of McDermott's employ e es recently confided to a San 
Antonio writer: "The general doesn't like being criticized." Oh, sorry.

 Mexican goalkeeper Jorge Campos and his national team's coach Miguel Mejia 
Baron are posing a striking problem for FIFA. 
</P>
<P>
 Baron, who has switched Campos from goal to a striker's role during qualifying 
matches for Mexico, indicated he would continue to do so in the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 But the announcement sent FIFA, the sport's governing body, into something of 
a spin with officials scouring their rules to determine whether they could 
allow the switch. 
</P>
<P>
 Reports filtered back to Baron that FIFA might not allow him to bring on a new 
goalkeeper and push Campos upfield. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaking at a news conference at the RFK Memorial Stadium in Washington, Baron 
said: "As far as I am concerned I can pick any of my squad to play where I 
want. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the rules have changed, I will expect to be notified of this by (FIFA 
general secretary) Sepp Blatter officially." 
</P>
<P>
 A FIFA official said on Saturday that while the World Cup rules were still 
being clarified, Campos would probably be allowed to play in the field if 
Mexico could provide him with a regular team jersey bearing his official 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 Campos would not be permitted to play in a teammate's shirt with the wrong 
number. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a logistical problem rather than anything to do with the laws of the 
game," said FIFA press officer Andreas Herren. 
</P>
<P>
 "Campos played in this role in the preliminaries, so from a law point of view 
it is feasible. But World Cup regulations say a player must use his numbered 
shirt throughout the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are investigating and it may be if Mexico can provide him with another 
jersey with his number on he will be allowed to change positions during a 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 Campos has played as a striker twice for Mexico and has also been switched 
from goalkeeper to a forward position during a match several times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not sure what I shall do," said the goalkeeper, one of the most 
colourful characters at the World Cup. "I may play in goal for the whole match, 
or I may come out for five or 10 minutes or longer. It depends on the coach." 
</P>
<P>
 Campos, 27, once played up front for a full season with his club Universidad 
Nacional and finished as their leading goal scorer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is my dream to play in attack, but I know I have to play in goal too," 
said the former Acapulco surfer whose fluorescent green-and-pink goalkeeping 
jerseys have added to his reputation as a maverick. He often makes unscheduled 
excursions into attack as well to boost his team's offense.

ANN CONWAY: LIFE WITHOUT HAL SEGERSTROM JR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANN CONWAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeanette Segerstrom is reluctant to pose next to the Steinway that graces her 
bay-front home in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can hardly play now," she admits, gazing at the baby grand. "Arthritis." 
</P>
<P>
 But it was her love of piano that brought her and her late husband, Hal 
Segerstrom Jr., together. "Yes, a piano is pretty much where it all began," she 
says, flashing a small smile. 
</P>
<P>
 So this widow of five months, this shy patron of the arts who has taken her 
husband's place beside Henry Segerstrom as a managing partner of C.J. 
Segerstrom & Sons (owner of South Coast Plaza) sits primly on a piano bench and 
smiles for the camera. 
</P>
<P>
 In minutes, 50 opera buffs will sweep across her gleaming marble foyer to sip 
Roderer Estate Champagne and dine alfresco on tenderloin of veal with Cognac 
sauce. 
</P>
<P>
 This elegant villa on two bay-front lots is at the top of the social set's 
A-list for party sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Here lives one of Orange County's most private and wealthy women (her share of 
C.J. Segerstrom & Sons is 50%), a woman whose refined taste is manifested in 
the matching carved jade lamps that adorn a living room table, the amethyst 
Baccarat candelabra that gleam in the dining room, her Chanel evening wear. 
</P>
<P>
 And besides the demands of the business, it is soirees such as this one for 
Opera Pacific that keep her going. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hal loved to share, and he loved people," says Jeanette, 65, surveying the 
party scene. Round tables skirted in white are topped with vases of white 
roses. Programs inscribed with each guest's name serve as place cards. A 
pianist plays "The Way You Look Tonight." 
</P>
<P>
 It is seconds before party-goers will arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is time for a quick tour of the house -- time to talk about her 
husband of almost 44 years, what they had, her future. 
</P>
<P>
 He was nutty about her when she was a music student at USC all those years 
ago. A pretty brunette with a Pepsodent smile, she was the piano accompanist 
for the men's glee club. Hal was a member. "He had the most beautiful voice," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 He asked her to cut class to see "Madama Butterfly" at the Shrine Auditorium 
across the street. It was their first date. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, after they began seeing each other, he would have to excuse himself on 
weekends. He had to work his family's Orange County farm that was the largest 
independent producer of lima beans in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me I could stay in my place (on weekends) and knit," Jeanette says. 
"I gave him back his rooter's cap and told him that if he thought I was going 
to just sit here and knit every weekend he could just blow! 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, the look look on Hal's face! I thought, 'Oh my God. I'm never going to 
see him again!' " 
</P>
<P>
 So she decided to stay put and knit, just like he said. Later, she apologized 
for her remarks. They became engaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanette stops in an upstairs hallway and opens a closet door. Sitting on a 
countertop is the cardinal and gold rooter's cap. "There it is," she says. "Of 
course I saved it." 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a stop at the billiard room Hal shared with his pals, the master 
bedroom suite where the couple loved to watch the boats in the bay, the hallway 
alcove that houses a solid silver and gold replica of a tractor. "That was 
Hal's pride and joy," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early years of their marriage, they lived in a cottage on Martha Lane 
in Santa Ana. "I didn't marry Hal for his money," Jeanette says, laughing. "He 
didn't have any." 
</P>
<P>
 He loved to garden, to make hanging baskets. She loved to fuss around the 
house. They planted a tree. "I took a nostalgic drive over there recently, and 
the tree is still there," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 Years and a few moves later, when the couple finally moved into the bay-front 
home Jeanette now occupies, Hal said, "Why did we wait so long?"  
</P>
<P>
 It's a question that haunts her today. Hal died of heart failure in January. 
"He had a few good years here," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Jeanette keeps busy with her four children, nine grandchildren, 
business tasks and charitable causes. 
</P>
<P>
 She has opened her doors to USC ("Now I know a marching band can fit on my 
staircase."), Children's Hospital of Orange County, UC Irvine. She also 
supports the Orange County Performing Arts Center, the Pacific Symphony and the 
Orange County Philharmonic Society. 
</P>
<P>
 And recently, in Hal's name, she donated $100,000 to underwrite Opera 
Pacific's fall production of "Aida." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, opera is where it all really began. "Hal liked opera, but he loved 
the people who support it. They are the cream of the crop," she says. "They 
loved Hal, and he loved them."

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; COMMENTARY ON WOMANHOOD; DISMANTLING BARRIERS THAT LIMIT 
GIRLS' OPPORTUNITIES, SUCCESS; FATHERS CAN HELP BREAK THE TRADITIONAL 
STEREOTYPES, FOSTER LEADERSHIP AND BUILD DAUGHTERS' CONFIDENCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RITA REDAELLI, Rita Redaelli is executive director of Girls Inc. of Orange 
County. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On April 28, Take Our Daughters to Work Day, we made a promise to girls. By 
bringing them to our offices, construction sites and fire stations, we told 
them we believe in them, we value them and we think they are essential to the 
future of our nation. 
</P>
<P>
 We want to widen the call and opportunity beyond the mother-daughter 
revolution to include fathers. 
</P>
<P>
 Father's Day is the ideal day for dads to rededicate themselves to actively 
taking part in fulfilling that promise, to help shape the lives of their 
daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 Since April 28, after all that attention was directed at daughters in the 
workplace, those girls have gone back to their schools and neighborhoods where 
they are likely to be overlooked and undervalued for the next 364 days, until 
Take Our Daughters to Work Day comes around again. 
</P>
<P>
 They will raise their hands in class only to see the boys next to them get 
called on. They will be complimented on their looks rather than their 
accomplishments. They will be given tea sets and dolls, which prepare them for 
a future of work in the home -- not in the paid work force. 
</P>
<P>
 While work inside the home is invaluable, the reality is that most women work 
outside the home -- for pay -- for a significant part of their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Preparing girls to become leaders in the worlds of work and public life and to 
make the 21st Century a time when girls can lead requires an ongoing and 
concerted effort on the part of all adults. 
</P>
<P>
 Fathers, your daughters every day are subjected to messages about who they are 
and what they can be. These messages come from many sources including family, 
religious organizations, schools, community and the media. We must strive to 
break traditional patterns, foster girls' leadership, build their confidence 
and not be afraid to help them take on the tough issues facing them today. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's proof why growing up is serious business: The average woman earns just 
72 cents for every dollar earned by the average man; nearly two-thirds of all 
adults in the United States with poverty-level incomes are women; many 
teachers, parents and other adults have lower expectations of girls' 
performance in math and science than of boys'; adolescent girls are four to 
five times more likely than boys to attempt suicide; 40% of teens will have 
been pregnant at least once before age 20; AIDS is the fourth most common cause 
of death among women ages 15 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
 At Girls Inc., this effort is one we take to heart. Every day we give girls 
opportunities to develop new skills and gain confidence in their abilities. Our 
programs encourage girls in science and math, help them avoid early pregnancy 
and enable them to identify their own values and act accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls are entitled to basic rights -- rights that they are denied through the 
limitations of gender stereotypes. Fathers, you can work with your daughters to 
help them change their own lives -- and you can work to help change society, to 
create a better world for girls, with improved options for all. Both efforts 
are necessary to make these basic rights a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Girls have a right to be themselves -- people first and females second -- and 
to resist pressure to behave in sexist stereotypical ways. 
</P>
<P>
 In the spirit of rekindling your commitment, we have identified specific steps 
fathers and all adults can take every day of the year to help your daughters 
become strong, smart and bold: 
</P>
<P>
 * Debunk the myth of Prince Charming in favor of the reality that most women 
will work outside the home to support themselves and their families. 
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid rescuing your daughters. Encourage girls to get dirty, disheveled and 
sweaty in pursuit of a goal and to make big, interesting mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 * Help your daughters understand and appreciate their bodies as they are. Work 
with girls to develop a personal style that feels comfortable and attractive to 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 * Discourage tentative, questioning, approval-seeking approaches that girls 
are socialized to use. Teach your daughters to think on their feet, make their 
points and defend their positions without apology. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pressure toy and publishing companies to produce non-sexist toys, books and 
materials in which girls are involved in activities that go beyond nurturing 
and romantic roles. 
</P>
<P>
 * Confront widespread notions of female fragility. Challenge views in the 
media and elsewhere of assertive women as "unfeminine" or destructive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Enable your daughters to become media critics. Examine portrayals of girls 
and women in television programs, popular songs, movies, books and magazines. 
Are the portrayals realistic? Are female characters judged more by their looks 
or their actions? 
</P>
<P>
 * Provide opportunities for your daughters to explore roles, experiences and 
activities that are generally reserved for boys. Girls may not ask for the 
opportunity to play with worms, learn carpentry or construct an electrical 
circuit for a model train but they participate eagerly when given the chance to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 * Address sexism anywhere young people are sorted by gender into programs 
based on interest or skills they are "supposed" to have, and work to achieve 
comparable pay for work of comparable value. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pressure the media and fashion industry to expand their definition of beauty 
and to celebrate women in ways that go beyond physical appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 * Treat her with respect. 
</P>
<P>
 Dismantling the stereotypes that limit your daughter's chances or success 
needs to be a daily activity. These steps provide a starting point. If we start 
today, next year when we bring our daughters to work, their questions will be 
tougher, their participation more enthusiastic and their goals loftier. So that 
someday, they will proudly take their daughters to work. 
</P>
<P>
 And so, the message reads: Happy Father's Day, Dad, to the man who believed in 
me and taught me all about life and values, who led me across the 
steppingstones of growing up until I safely and boldly reached the other side 
of adulthood.

HOW COULD RECALL VOTE HAPPEN? READERS HAVE SOME ANSWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I read with amusement Prof. Vince Buck's June 14 Op-Ed piece ("After 90 
Years Without One, How Could Fullerton Recall Happen?") wherein he attributes 
the Fullerton council recall to "lack of an informed electorate." As a former 
Fullerton resident who still works in that fine city, I think I am qualified to 
offer a better "reason" why the "uninformed" gave the City Council the boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, the electorate for once was too well informed about the condition of 
their city. Most of the time, we Orange County residents are too busy to bother 
with the everyday workings of local government and rely on the knowledge of a 
small cadre of better informed voters to decide who gets to represent us 
locally. It is only when we, the great unwashed voters, become informed of the 
true behavior of our elected representatives or see the direct results of their 
folly that we make our presence felt in local elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a fool or a political science professor could think that raising taxes in 
a city where incomes are flat or falling is a prudent policy. That 48 bucks 
that is being extracted from the average resident every year is not being 
replaced by pay raises. It means two pairs of children's dress shoes, seven 
movie tickets or even a single political science textbook that a Fullerton 
resident will not be able to afford this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously somebody made a mistake in letting residents become aware that the 
council approved a utility tax increase while the city's (and county's) largest 
employer is considering whether to close its plant in Fullerton. Undoubtedly, 
that employer has been considering how much more than $4 a month they are 
paying in utility taxes before they make their decision to close a plant that 
employs over 6,000 people. One thing is certain, however. The next City Council 
will not make the mistake that the current one made. 
</P>
<P>
 What is particularly amusing is how the local intelligentsia rationalize their 
disappointment in the Great Unwashed. "It is only because we need to educate 
the voters!" they say. Maybe the voters are better informed than they realize.  
</P>

 * The Fullerton Recalls Committee is very disappointed that The Times 
published the column by Vince Buck in the manner that it did. The ordinary 
reader would guess that the column is an objective analysis by an aloof 
academic. Nothing could be less true. 
</P>
<P>
 Vince Buck repeatedly wrote anti-recall letters to the anti-recall newsletter, 
The Fullerton Observer. He lent his name to anti-recall propaganda. He 
campaigned against the recall. He is hardly disinterested. Yet The Times lent 
his position authority by noting that he is "a political science professor at 
Cal State Fullerton." 
</P>
<P>
 We think that The Times did better when it printed the neutral comments by 
Prof. Mark Petracca of UC Irvine, who was uninvolved with the Fullerton recall. 
</P>
<P>
 W. SNOW HUME 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary, Fullerton Recalls Committee 
</P>
<P>
 * Assuming he was accurately quoted, the comments of UC Irvine's Mark Petracca 
("Officials Feel Voter Unrest in Fullerton, Westminster," June 9,) concerning 
the Fullerton recall effort were shocking. His sweeping statements, made with 
no contextual reference to the issues involved, reflect a lack of balance and 
objectivity. 
</P>
<P>
 When Mr. Petracca states that he was " . . . delighted that someone finally 
got recalled, because it is going to scare the pants off every elected official 
in this county who thinks it can't happen to them . . . , " he in effect is 
arguing that issues aren't important. He is arguing that the divisiveness 
caused by the recall, and the chilling impact it is already having on city 
employees and potential candidates for the City Council, are of little concern. 
Mr. Petracca implies that it is of small comparative importance that the agenda 
of the recall proponents, if implemented, will drastically reduce revenue and 
strip away vital services. Rather, he would have us believe that none of these 
consequences is as important as the fact that the recall of three dedicated 
council members will "scare the pants off" other elected officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, I live in Fullerton and I can tell you that I am scared -- not only of 
what will most likely be the profoundly adverse consequences of the recall, but 
also of the potential damage caused by the irresponsible utterances of 
individuals who certainly should know better. 
</P>

<P>
 * I have so many thoughts today -- astonishment, anger and mostly sadness for 
our wonderful city. Has the world gone mad? Or, has the economy frightened good 
people until they can no longer reason? Voters' apathy has destroyed a good and 
caring council. We are all poorer today from this selfish action of a few 
disgruntled people. 
</P>
<P>
 DONNA STRATTON 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton 
</P>
<P>
 * (Vince Buck's) words, (referring to the people behind the recall): "Who are 
they? A group of previously uninvolved individuals who met at a Ross Perot 
rally and who share a general distrust of government and a lack of faith in 
elected leaders and civil servants." 
</P>
<P>
 Who are they really? Members of United We Stand America, a citizen volunteer 
group promoting government and economic reform. They are organized in every 
congressional district in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Mr. Buck, the council's alarm bells should have gone off when "a 
woman was recently elected without previous experience in civic affairs. Her 
victory demonstrated that there was a large group of voters who were easily 
influenced by slick campaign techniques," (he wrote). This is news to him? How 
else can Bill Clinton's election be explained? Perhaps her victory demonstrated 
the fact that the "residents who don't know what is happening in the city" 
actually have the situation well in hand.

TOLL ROAD TEMBLOR

<P>
 * If Governor Wilson really wants to find the $200 million to finance " . . . 
the state share of earthquake recovery costs" ("Defeat of Quake Relief Bonds 
Adds To Budget Crisis," June 9), he need not look any further than the state's 
budget for Orange County's toll roads. 
</P>
<P>
 The state has committed $110 million for just the San Joaquin Hills toll road! 
If you add to this similar amounts for the Eastern and Foothill toll roads, the 
state will have more than enough money for the needed earthquake repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Californians will be spared the humiliation of funding roads they 
will have to pay to use.

ROLE OF PARENTS, JUDICIARY IN PETERS' CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Learning Disabilities Assn. of California, Orange County chapter, is 
very concerned with the publicity about the Jimmy Peters case.  
</P>
<P>
 While the father's civil rights may have been honored, the child's right to a 
free and appropriate public education may have been lost. No one seems to be 
focusing on the child's needs. Children are not bad without a reason. Find the 
reason and you can help the child. 
</P>
<P>
 The regular classroom can be the least appropriate, most restrictive 
environment for a child whose needs are not being accommodated. The most 
appropriate, least restrictive environment is the placement where the child is 
happy, safe, and learning at his/her rate and style. Only the needs of the 
child should determine the classroom placement. 
</P>
<P>
 In Jimmy Peters' case, his actions in the classroom show how inappropriate 
this mainstream placement is for him. The school is a loser because some of its 
Average Daily Attendance funding is lost as frightened parents take classmates 
and siblings out of the school and away from possible harm. The teacher and 
classroom aide have both lost since they are both out on medical-stress leave. 
The general public is a loser because of all the taxpayer dollars being spent 
on litigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy's dad is not a winner, either. His misconception of Jimmy's needs has 
affected his thinking as to what he wants for his child. In my opinion, Jimmy 
will only be tolerated and not educated in his present classroom. The biggest 
loser is Jimmy because he is trying to communicate, and no one is listening.

 * I have been following the stories about Jimmy Peters, the young man who is 
labeled as with special needs and disruptive and violent in the classroom. My 
son is in a special-needs preschool program in the Capistrano Unified School 
District. He will be attending special-needs kindergarten in fall. At that time 
he will be gradually mainstreamed into a "regular" classroom to see if he can 
handle being with 30 children and only one teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 I resent people calling him "one of those kids." He was born with problems by 
no fault of his own. I will put him in a "regular" classroom when I feel he is 
ready, not when the other parents make the judgment for my child. 
</P>
<P>
 My daughter is gifted and in a regular second-grade class. There are children 
in there who are classified as "regular" children who can give Jimmy Peters a 
real run for his money. These are children who have no concern for other 
children. They break equipment, they push and shove the other children, they 
are disruptive in class. There are no protesters against these children since 
they are not "different." It is time for parents to grow up and learn to accept 
that some children have problems. There are parents out there who will protest 
the misbehavior of another child, but will ignore that their child has 
problems, or is a problem in the classroom.

 * I am appalled but not surprised by the recent court ruling of U.S. District 
Judge Matthew Byrne, who has a long history of anti-public school decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 As a retired schoolteacher (38 years), I have seen the gradual eroding of 
standards of scholarship, learning, and behavior in our public schools. The 
Byrne decision is simply another nail in the coffin of public school education. 
</P>
<P>
 Public schools are no longer run by local school boards, but by the judiciary 
who are without concern for the safety of students or the quality of teaching. 
Their only concern seems to be "politically correct" decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the factors that the courts seem not to be aware of is that the 
attention span of children is different. Children with longer spans should be 
taught in a different way than children with short spans. When you try to mix 
the two you do not meet the needs of either group, and learning is reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 The "full-inclusion" parents do not understand or are unwilling to admit that 
their children are different in their behavior, learning styles, comprehension, 
and level of achievement. This difference in learning styles does not mean that 
their children are less valuable or important. What it does mean is that to 
meet their needs, they must have special situations with teachers who want to 
teach and are trained to do so. Ten years from now these parents will regret 
their decision when their children can't read as well as they might have. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope that the Huntington Beach school board will vote to appeal a bad 
decision by an incompetent judge who should be removed.

<P>
 * Upon viewing the controversy surrounding Jimmy Peters' return to his 
kindergarten classroom, I believe that those parents who were protesting the 
return of Jimmy were probably disrupting the educational process at Circle View 
Elementary School much more than a 6-year-old child possibly could. 
</P>
<P>
 By waving placards, encouraging supporters to honk their car horns and 
marching their children out of the classroom upon his arrival, they caused a 
disservice to those students who remained in the classroom and who likely 
couldn't care less whether Jimmy was in attendance or not. I was particularly 
bothered to hear that some parents chose not to send their children to school, 
even though they weren't classmates of Jimmy. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than disrupting the education process by harassing a 6-year-old 
disabled child and his father, these self-serving parents should devote their 
spare time volunteering in the classroom in an effort to enhance, rather than 
trivialize, the educational process. Or better yet, they should devote their 
time toward improving the school district's "full-inclusion" program so that 
the physical wounds from a child's bite or kick will heal much quicker than the 
emotional wounds they've inflicted upon Jimmy. Besides, if this child is so 
terrible, why was he hugged by some of his fellow classmates upon his return?

SWATTED STUDENT CAUSED OWN TROUBLES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In reading your story "Swat Leads to Discrimination Complaint Against 
Professor," (June 10) I too felt a rush of humiliation and rage. As an African 
American father of four, my humiliation was at the fact that (Keary Johns) 
willingly placed himself in such a compromising position because he was "in a 
bind" of his own doing. My rage was because rather than accept responsibility 
for his actions, he set out to blame everyone but himself for what resulted. 
(Johns) was not stripped of his manhood, he willingly sacrificed it when he 
chose to compromise his bare backside in pursuit of a grade and a diploma. How 
valuable can graduation from a university be when it is gained at the cost of 
one's manhood? I think his humiliation came too late in his academic learning 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 I make no excuses for the Prof. (Julian) Fosters of the world. They represent 
those in our society who will take a swipe at the bare backsides of all who 
allow themselves to become vulnerable. (Johns') college education should have 
taught him that.  
</P>
<P>
 Johns also alleged that he was unfairly stripped of his financial aid when Cal 
State Fullerton dropped its football program. I suggest he talk to some of 
those people in the real world he is about to enter who lost their jobs because 
their companies found it necessary to downsize. Talk about unfair! Wake up, Mr. 
Johns, and take a look at the realities of the competitive world you are about 
to inherit. 
</P>
<P>
 Keary, the next time you expose yourself to a whacking, let it be on your 
head. That is where your problem appears to be, not your behind. 
</P>
<P>

 * So poor Keary Johns thinks he lost his manhood due to a swat over a failing 
grade from a professor emeritus who was raised in England. Nonsense, he lost it 
first when he decided not to attend classes, next when he groveled and begged 
for a passing grade, next when he reneged on his part of the deal, and again 
when he decided to prostitute himself by going to an attorney to make some 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The upshot? The press trashes the professor, makes Johns out to be a 
victim/hero, and our legal system gives him a lot more money than he could have 
made on his own. Only in America! 
</P>

<P>
 * Recently I read an article on African American student Keary Johns, who was 
seeking $1 million in damages for a bias claim.  
</P>
<P>
 It is so ridiculous. I really cannot understand Johns' decision to claim money 
when it so clear that it was by his choice to have undergone a deal. It was his 
fault from the start that he chose not to attend that class. I'm not saying 
that what Prof. Foster did was marvelous, but Johns had initiated this problem 
from the very beginning and the professor is paying a great price. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's society, unfortunately, suffers from many racial conflicts. However, 
for everyone to blame everything as a racist incident is senseless. Everyone 
seem to be using this excuse as a source of income. We all must have 
understanding for our fellow brothers and sisters of all races. We ought to 
stop blaming ourselves for once.

ANOTHER CHAPTER IN SAGA OF IMMIGRANTS; VIETNAMESE BECOMING PART OF AMERICAN 
FABRIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The latest chapter in the unending saga of immigrants becoming Americans is 
being written by the Vietnamese -- those who fled the Communist takeover in 
1975 and those who arrived last month, those working on shrimp boats in 
Louisiana and in factories in Garden Grove. And while their circumstances are 
different, it is striking how similar their assimilation has been to that of 
earlier immigrants, the ones who fled Europe and Mexico, rather than Asia, who 
sought to escape famine or poverty rather than war and retribution. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times Poll recently interviewed more than 800 Vietnamese adults living in 
Southern California, most of them in Orange County. Considering the shock of 
being torn from their homeland, surprisingly few refugees said they would 
return to Vietnam if the Communists were thrown out. Large numbers of the 
newcomers are American citizens now; most who were not said they expected to be 
citizens soon. 
</P>
<P>
 One encouraging sign of a break with the past was the strong support 
Vietnamese Americans expressed for better ties with Hanoi. More than half the 
refugees and immigrants backed full diplomatic relations between America and 
Vietnam, which would be a major step up from the limited trade relations now 
existing. 
</P>
<P>
 The support for closer links marked a sharp turnabout from the odious climate 
of fear that for too long paralyzed the newcomers, making those supporting even 
minimal relations with their former homeland afraid to speak out lest more 
hawkish Vietnamese Americans abuse them verbally or even physically. After all, 
it was only seven years ago that newspaper editor Tap Van Pham was killed in a 
firebombing of his Garden Grove office after publishing advertisements for 
companies that some anti-Communists considered fronts for the Vietnamese 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of change is in the reason the Vietnamese come to America. The 
refugees of 1975 were fleeing expected persecution when the Communists took 
over; U.S. troops pushed helicopter after helicopter over the side of American 
warships to make room for the refugees in some of the war's most memorable 
newsreel footage.  
</P>
<P>
 Years later the "boat people" fled in overcrowded, rickety craft in dangerous 
and expensive journeys designed to avoid prison or hunger. These days many 
newcomers are more immigrants than refugees, seeking to join families already 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the biggest sign of Americanization is the one linking the 
Vietnamese of Westminster's Little Saigon to previous groups like the Italians 
of Little Italy: The young are Americans by birth, citizenship and feeling. 
Vietnam is their parents' homeland, not theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 A 23-year-old woman said that the older generation prefers to shop in Little 
Saigon; the younger generation prefers the mall at South Coast Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Another sign of the times is polling itself, which has given us insights into 
the newcomers' adjustment; we need not await historians' research. The Times 
poll reflected problems, too. One of every 11 surveyed reported being a victim 
of discrimination. Too many Vietnamese-American youth have joined violent 
gangs, and police have said they would like more cooperation in investigating 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Vietnamese community itself deserves credit for continuing to help 
newcomers, briefing them on what to expect, setting up language classes and 
passing on job tips. Many of the newcomers have made the transition from 
Vietnamese to Vietnamese Americans, en route to their children and 
grandchildren simply being Americans.

UCI MOVES TO FOREFRONT OF CANCER STUDIES; RESEARCH DESIGNATION WILL ATTRACT 
FUNDS; SCHOOL WILL STEP UP WORK IN COMMUNITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The selection of UC Irvine as a special cancer center by the National Cancer 
Institute will lend additional stature to a young university that has been 
growing in reputation as a center for research. 
</P>
<P>
 But what is also special about the selection is that the criteria for 
designation were not only work done in the laboratory, but also for clinical 
work and for interaction with the community. This means not just research, but 
service to people in need, which is a sure test of commitment to a larger world 
in any university's efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Brian Kimes, an associate director at the institute in Maryland, 
UCI has received an advisory that it likely will receive the formal designation 
by the end of the summer. This is important for several reasons. First, it will 
allow the university to apply for special research grants available only to 
NCI-approved cancer centers, which may bring up to $2.4 million in federal 
grant money to the university over three years. This can lead to more cancer 
researchers, physicians and patients seeking state-of-the-art medicine. That 
can only contribute to the significance of UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 Much credit should go to Dr. Frank L. Meyskens Jr., who was recruited from the 
University of Arizona five years ago to head the effort for NCI recognition. He 
has brought scientists and researchers together, along with setting the vision 
for research grants.  
</P>
<P>
 Meyskens also has been a leader in chemo-prevention by studying the cancer 
preventive powers of Vitamin A. Recently, he was principal author of a study 
published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute that showed that a 
drug similar to Vitamin A can reverse precancerous conditions of the cervix. 
</P>
<P>
 The new designation also puts UCI in line to become one day a comprehensive 
cancer center, an even more prestigious NCI designation that could put it in a 
league with only 27 other institutions around the country.

DORNAN SAYS AN APOLOGY IS IN ORDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The Times has struck again -- this time by embellishing a simple exchange 
between myself and a Times reporter and elevating it to something it was not 
("Dornan Feels Reagans' Pain at Naked Aggression Shown by Daughter Patti," June 
12). 
</P>
<P>
 It is true I am disturbed that President Reagan's daughter at 42 years of age 
posed for Playboy magazine. I am disturbed not only as a critic of stupid, 
soft- and hard-core pornography but also as a father of five and grandfather of 
nine who empathizes with a truly great former President over the embarrassing 
actions of his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 However, I was not, as reported by The Times, "waving around the nude 
photographs of Davis and making a tizzy about it to anyone who would listen." 
First, I have not seen nor did I have in my possession the Playboy pictures. I 
have always opposed Hugh Hefner and his financial empire built on the 
degradation of women. The object in question was a Washington newspaper article 
about Ms. Davis' expose, which was handed to me rather gleefully by a Democrat. 
The one photograph with the article showed little of Ms. Davis but a lot of 
Hefner's dog. The Times' implication at best was that I had a Playboy in hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, the exchange took place during a conversation between myself and one 
female Times reporter. As far as "waving" is concerned, I was seated during the 
brief exchange concluding a long interview on another subject. Only one other 
person, a member of my staff, was present. This does not constitute "waving 
around" or "making a tizzy to anyone who would listen." In fact, I threw the 
article away within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 I do not fault The Times for reporting my opinion about Ms. Davis' incessant 
and vicious posturing against her wonderful parents. I do, however, fault The 
Times for sensationalism and mean-spirited disregard for simple facts.

GARDEN GROVE THEME PARK A GOOD IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * The (Garden Grove) City Council, acting as the Redevelopment Agency, which 
agreed to pay for half the cost of a study on the possibility of building a 
theme park in the city, has met opposition from Councilman Robert F. Dinsen, 
who said the theme park could involve enormous costs that the city may not be 
able to afford ("Garden Grove OKs $17,500 Toward Theme Park Study," June 5). 
</P>
<P>
 As with any business venture, there are costs.However, the theme parks that 
now exist in the Southern California area -- Magic Mountain, Disneyland, 
Universal Studios and Knott's Berry Farm -- are all doing quite well. 
</P>
<P>
 The other point is that this would provide a lot of new jobs, for high school 
age and above, which are greatly needed. 
</P>
<P>
 A new theme park, which is planned to feature shopping malls and hotels, 
anchored by an international trade and cultural center, would not only boost 
the economy but could be educational for many. 
</P>
<P>
 I am behind the idea, and hope that it comes to pass.

WHEN WILL CITY 'GET IT' ON JOBS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I just can't believe it. After two years of traveling around Orange County 
talking about the economy, jobs, and the business environment . . . after two 
years of existence of Partnership 2010 and the Orange County Economic 
Development Consortium . . . after two years of listening to people bemoan the 
exodus of jobs from the county . . . after all that, I'm still amazed at the 
shortsightedness of some civic leaders who still "just don't get it." 
</P>
<P>
 Recently I attended the Costa Mesa City Council meeting to watch deliberations 
regarding an expansion project for the Automobile Club of Southern California. 
What I watched is an abomination of the political process, a total disregard 
for the citizens who came to express their views, and a perfect example of why 
business would choose to locate elsewhere rather than stay where they are. 
</P>
<P>
 What should have been a fairly normal meeting of the council to take public 
testimony before voting to accept the finding of the city's own Planning 
Commission and approve the project, became a grandstanding performance by the 
mayor who thought it more important to second-guess the city's Planning 
Commission and stage a staff meeting rather than carry on the work of the 
council and the public interest. 
</P>
<P>
 For the two hours I stayed, and for the three hours following, the rest of the 
council allowed the mayor to bully her personal agenda at the expense of the 
city staff, the residents and businesses in attendance, and the company that 
wants to be home for over 2,400 jobs in the city. If I were the president of 
the Automobile Club I would have stood up, told the council to quit wasting the 
staff and audience's time, begin shutting down operations in the city 
immediately, and start looking for a new location. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not what is meant by being business-friendly by any stretch of the 
imagination. Come on mayor, start to at least try to "get it." I'd be more than 
happy to come over and explain it all to you.

THANKING THOSE WHO DIDN'T VOTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I'd like to convey my thanks to all the qualified citizens in Orange County 
and the rest of California who failed to vote in the June 7 elections. 
</P>
<P>
 By doing so, those people gave me the opportunity to multiply my personal 
voting power by a factor of three, at least . . . possibly four.And, since my 
two adult, voting daughters respect my opinions, they voted the same way I did. 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore, I am in the effective (and admirable) position of having cast up to 
twelve legal votes. 
</P>
<P>
 I would think that even the old Chicago political machine probably wasn't as 
proficient at influencing results. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether these non-voting citizens appreciate my having a more powerful voice 
than they may never be known, since they probably won't read this letter even 
if it is published. 
</P>
<P>
 But, let them be warned that their non-participation in the vote leads to a 
corresponding inability for them to exercise control over future decisions, 
many of which may severely affect them.

'MANAGED CARE' BANDWAGON SOUNDS SOUR TO PHYSICIANS; MEDICINE: NEW SYSTEM 
REPLACES TRADITIONAL HEALTH DELIVERY. NOW HOSPITAL EMPLOYEES PROVIDE ALL CARE 
TO BIG GROUPS OF PATIENTS FOR A FLAT FEE. PROFITS DEPEND ON LIMITING PROCEDURES

 James T. Shaeffer, an orthopedic surgeon here for 18 years, figures that the 
patients he has sent to St. John's Regional Health Center have paid millions of 
dollars of medical fees to the 736-bed nonprofit hospital operated by the 
Catholic Sisters of Mercy. 
</P>
<P>
 So Shaeffer was surprised last fall when hospital officials called him in and 
disclosed that St. John's would try to buy out his practice and the practices 
of dozens of local physicians. Once St. John's had established a tightly 
controlled network of clinics and doctors, it would sell its own "managed care" 
health plan to businesses, organizations and insurance companies. Doctors who 
did not go to work for St. John's network would face an uncertain future. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision, made without consultation with most of Springfield's independent 
physicians, left Shaeffer feeling "about as valued as the housekeeping staff," 
he said. Now he and more than 200 other physicians have until Aug. 1 to decide 
whether to sell the hospital their practices, including medical records, 
patient lists and office assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Like it or not, Springfield's medical community is being shoved aboard the 
fastest-moving bandwagon in the U.S. health care industry. Known as "managed 
care," it replaces the traditional health delivery system, in which insurance 
companies paid providers for every procedure or diagnosis. In managed care, 
networks of hospitals and doctors, who often are hospital employees, provide 
all care to big groups of patients for a flat fee. Profits depend on limiting 
procedures and cutting costs as much as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 The shift to managed care, which is occurring even without health reform in 
Washington, has stirred similar turmoil in hundreds of medical communities 
around the country and led to calls by the American Medical Assn. for 
legislation to protect the doctors' independence. In some regions, such as 
Minnesota and Southern California, managed care has affected drastically what 
doctors are paid and how they practice medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John's is offering signing bonuses and other fringe benefits and has 
promised not to "interfere with the exercise of independent medical judgment by 
physician(s)." But doctors who accept employment but quit later would face 
penalties of $1,000 a day if they practiced medicine within 25 miles of 
Springfield within two years after leaving St. John's, according to documents 
obtained from sources other than Shaeffer. 
</P>
<P>
 Some doctors fear that if most local residents are enrolled in the health 
plans of St. John's and its main rival, Cox Health Systems, there would not be 
enough patients left for independent physicians to treat. "Nobody knows whether 
they can survive outside the system," said a doctor who asked not to be named. 
"The hospitals are saying, 'Here's your option. It's up to you. And you're not 
getting a second chance.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by health reform proposals and fear of competition from well-heeled 
insurance companies and HMOs (health maintenance organizations), St. John's and 
Cox have been moving aggressively to dominate this changing health care 
landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger isn't socialized medicine, it's commercialized medicine," said 
Sylvan Lee Weinberg, past president of the American College of Cardiology. 
"Managed care is totally controlling everything, the flow of patients and 
access to doctors. It's an absolute scandal." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials in Springfield say their goal is efficiency and cost 
control, and many applaud their move. Even if Springfield ends up with only two 
big hospital-based networks, "It will be like having two Ford dealers: You'll 
go to the one with the best deal," said Gordon Kinney, who runs Med-Pay Inc., a 
local insurance firm representing 40,000 employees and dependents. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics question whether the two networks will leave much room for 
competing health plans and HMOs. They also wonder whether hospitals, with a 
vested interest in filling beds and using their expensive medical technology, 
are the best institutions to contain costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "An oligopoly is not going to bring the level of competition that will ensure 
the continuous search for lower costs and higher quality," said J. Neal 
Ethridge, past chairman of the Ozarks Area Business Group on Health, a 
coalition of small businesses covering 36,400 employees and dependents that has 
tried unsuccessfully to bargain with the hospitals in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversion of St. John's and Cox to managed care still surprises many in 
Missouri. For years, both resisted the penetration of the Springfield health 
care market by HMOs and refused to bargain with local business groups over 
prices. 
</P>
<P>
 St. John's, which is part of a chain of hospitals operated by the St. 
Louis-based Sisters of Mercy Health System, and Cox, named after the late 
Springfield businessman Lester E. Cox, were major beneficiaries of traditional 
"fee-for-service" medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors could order all the tests and services at the hospitals they wanted, 
and insurance companies would pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Springfield's "Medical Mile," running along both sides of National Avenue 
between Sunshine Street and Republic Road, is a kind of monument to the 
fee-for-service era. While the southwest Missouri economy sputtered with the 
rest of the country in recent years, and Zenith Corp. pulled up stakes in 
Springfield at a cost of 2,500 jobs in 1993, nonprofit Cox and St. John's piled 
up big cash surpluses and invested tens of millions of dollars in buildings and 
state-of-the-art medical technology.

9 DAYS AFTER D-DAY, U.S. MOUNTED MASSIVE ASSAULT ON SAIPAN IN PACIFIC; WORLD 
WAR II: A LITTLE OVER A YEAR LATER, A B-29 TOOK OFF FROM THE MARIANA ISLANDS 
WITH THE NAME "ENOLA GAY" ON ITS NOSE. DESTINATION, HIROSHIMA.

<P>
 From 1907 onward, Japan had plans for an eventual war with the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The essential component never varied: The American Navy would be lured across 
the Pacific, sniped at as it came. When it reached Japan's home waters, it 
would be annihilated in a climactic battle. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, 1944, the stage was set. The United States was about to invade Saipan 
in the Mariana Islands, 1,268 miles southeast of Tokyo. Japan gathered its 
warships. 
</P>
<P>
 The fleet the Japanese would annihilate bore only a dim relationship to the 
one they had crippled at Pearl Harbor or even the one that won the crucial 
Battle of Midway seven months later. It was an awesome machine of fast carriers 
and battleships by the dozens that hadn't even existed when the war began. 
</P>
<P>
 As a measure of America's industrial and military might, both Saipan and 
Normandy were to be invaded within nine days of each other in the biggest 
operations in their theaters half a world apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Since November, 1943, with the bloody conquest of Tarawa, the combined forces 
of Adm. Chester W. Nimitz had island-hopped across the Central Pacific, each 
invasion point within range of land-based air support from the last and 
bypassing Japanese strongholds. 
</P>
<P>
 The campaign had its critics, particularly Gen. Douglas MacArthur, whose Army 
troops were fighting along the New Guinea coast toward the Philippines. That 
archipelago, where MacArthur's former command had been beaten into surrender in 
the high tide of Japanese aggression in 1942, represented a moral, political 
and strategic must to him. It was also, he argued, the easiest and most logical 
path to victory over Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Nimitz's thrust, with Marines also fighting up through the Solomon Islands, 
only diluted the U.S. effort. Nimitz's rebuttal, with the influential and 
outspoken backing of Navy Commander-in-Chief Adm. Ernest J. King, was that the 
most direct route was to stride across the Pacific directly to Japan. The 
Marianas would put Japan within bombing range of the new Boeing B-29 
Superfortresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics say Nimitz's drive added to the war's cost in lives and effort. Its 
supporters claim that it kept Japan off balance, their military having to 
guess, often incorrectly, where the Americans would strike next. One had only 
to look at a map, however, to see that the Marianas would be Nimitz's next 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 Nimitz, in fact, had initially opposed the idea. The Marianas had poor harbors 
and were in reach of enemy planes from the Philippines. King insisted. The 
Marianas were as essential as unsinkable aircraft carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Gen. Yoshitsugu Saito had 29,662 soldiers and 6,100 marines to defend the 
25-mile-long Saipan, shaped something like a rhinoceros on end. For several 
days U.S. warships led by 15 battleships had bombarded the shore defenses. From 
the shore Adm. Chuichi Nagumo recognized at least four of them as battlewagons 
his carriers had sunk at Pearl Harbor, since refloated. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 15, 1944, about 8,000 Marines of the 2nd and 4th Divisions landed 
under heavy resistance, scrambling over coral reefs to establish a 1-by-4-mile 
beachhead. By the end of the day, 20,000 troops were on shore. 
</P>
<P>
 Seaman James Fahey aboard the cruiser Montpelier noted the paradox that 
between bombardments his shipmates sunned or fished over the side "while on the 
beach men were killing each other." 
</P>
<P>
 The next day the Army's 27th Division landed with reinforcements. The combined 
force relentlessly penned the Japanese into the north end of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 The final phase for the Decisive Battle, A-Go (Operation A), was completed by 
the Japanese that April. According to the Japanese plan, the U.S. fleet would 
be decoyed within air range of the Philippines, then, teaming with the carrier 
force under Vice Adm. Jisaburo Ozawa, the Japanese planes would send it to the 
bottom. Prime Minister Hideki Tojo assured the navy that the Saipan invaders 
would suffer a similar fate. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. fleet was commanded by Adm. Raymond A. Spruance, the victor at Midway 
and a smart, judicious sailor with both a tendency to seasickness and reasoned 
tactics. His strike arm, Task Force 58, contained 15 carriers and seven fast 
battleships under Vice Adm. Marc Mitscher. His flattops outnumbered Ozawa's 2 
to 1 but each side had just under 1,000 aircraft, half of Ozawa's on land. 
</P>
<P>
 As was too often the case, the Japanese A-Go was overly intricate, requiring a 
finesse of coordination over vast expanses of ocean with less than perfect 
communications. The Americans were less dogmatic. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese scout planes spotted "an unknown number of carriers" June 18 west of 
Saipan. Rear Adm. Sueo Obayashi immediately launched an attack from his three 
carriers. Ozawa ordered the planes back to be ready for a bigger battle next 
morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitscher had also discovered the enemy and wanted to give chase. Spruance, 
whose primary mission was to protect the invasion, overruled him. 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning Ozawa sent his carrier planes aloft. As they departed, the 
U.S. submarine Albacore fired two torpedoes at the brand-new carrier Taiho. A 
Japanese pilot exploded one by diving his plane on it. The other hit the 
"unsinkable" Taiho on her starboard side. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage was controllable, but to clear fumes of leaking gasoline, a damage 
control officer turned on exhaust fans. They blew the fumes throughout the 
ship, turning it into a floating bomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Navy Hellcats, Grumman fighters specifically designed to outperform 
the enemy Zero, fell upon Ozawa's planes like falcons. Within a few hours -- in 
what became known as the Great Marianas Turkey Shoot -- they downed 346 planes, 
losing only 15 of their own. 
</P>
<P>
 The skipper of a second submarine, Cavalla, raised his periscope. There was a 
carrier with a Rising Sun "big as hell!" said Cmdr. Herman J. Kessler. Sneaking 
to within 1,000 yards, he hit Shokaku, one of Nagumo's Pearl Harbor carriers, 
with three torpedoes. She slowly turned turtle and sank. Half an hour later 
Taiho exploded "like Mt. Fuji." 
</P>
<P>
 Ozawa decided to withdraw to regroup. As daylight faded, Mitscher, with 
Spruance's approval, decided to attack even though the enemy was at extreme 
range. The planes found Ozawa at dusk and sank the carrier Hiyo and damaged two 
others and a battleship. 
</P>
<P>
 Twenty U.S. planes were lost in the attack and more began ditching on the 
flight home as they ran out of fuel. 
</P>
<P>
 "So long," a pilot radioed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm lost," signaled another. 
</P>
<P>
 Throwing prudence overboard, Mitscher ordered all lights on to guide the 
returnees. The dark sea became "a Hollywood premiere, Christmas in New York and 
the Fourth of July all in one." Eighty planes had ditched, but 49 fliers were 
rescued. 
</P>
<P>
 A-Go cost the Japanese 476 aircraft plus the three carriers. More important, 
because the Japanese did not follow the American process of withdrawing veteran 
pilots to train the next generation, their lost airmen were replaced by 
inexperienced recruits. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saipan itself, the ground commander, Gen. Holland M. (Howlin' Mad) Smith, a 
Marine, ignited a mini-war when he relieved the head of the 27th Division for 
lackluster performance. The Army was in an uproar, reflecting interservice 
rivalries that continually dogged the war in the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, "the only Marine who could outshout an admiral," bit his lip until it 
bled as Army brass called his Leathernecks "just a bunch of beach runners." 
Marines countered that the Army was overcautious and incompetent and barked 
when they encountered passing GI "dogfaces." 
</P>
<P>
 The firestorm was interrupted by a Japanese banzai charge on July 7. Officers 
with ancient samurai swords, the wounded hobbling on crutches, soldiers with 
rifles or only bamboo spears, came charging out of the night from their caves 
"like a movie cattle stampede." Marines had to drag bodies aside to keep open 
fields of fire. Four thousand of the enemy died. Worse was to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Believing the propaganda that the Americans were butchers and rapists, 
civilians began leaping from cliffs into the sea in mass suicide. One family 
tossed a grenade back and forth like a beanbag until it exploded. A woman 
giving birth jumped to her death. Mothers with crying babies sheltered in caves 
strangled them on orders from Japanese soldiers lest they give away their 
positions. A man who hesitated at the cliff's edge was shot by a Japanese 
soldier who was riddled in turn by the Americans. Whole families waded 
hand-in-hand into the surf. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, about 22,000 Saipanese killed themselves. Only 2,000 of the garrison 
survived. Obedient aides shot Nagumo and Saito in the back of the head: There 
was no time for the more ritual sepuku.  
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, Tojo's wife began receiving calls asking if her husband had killed 
himself yet. Instead, he resigned on July 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later the Marines and GIs of the 77th Division invaded Guam, the 
U.S. possession overrun by the Japanese early in the war. One enemy banzai 
charge fueled by sake was a drunken failure. A sober one almost pushed Marines 
of the 3rd Division into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Organized resistance on the island 150 miles from Saipan ended Aug. 10, but 
the last enemy soldier, Cpl. Shoichi Yokoi, didn't surrender until 1972, his 
rifle still serviceable but its wooden stock rotted away. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 24, the day before the U.S. Army broke out of the Normandy beachhead, 
two Marine divisions landed on Tinian, a smaller island within sight of Saipan. 
It was a textbook operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Adm. Richmond Kelly (Terrible) Turner, the Navy's landing expert, said he 
wouldn't put Marines on the beach Smith had selected. "Oh, yes, you will!" 
Howlin' Mad stormed. "You'll land any goddamn place I tell you!" 
</P>
<P>
 Smith feinted toward one beach and landed on another, quickly outmaneuvering 
Tinian's 10,000-man garrison, of which only 250 survived. Within days Navy 
Seabees began turning Tinian's flatlands into the largest air field in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marianas had cost the Americans 24,009 casualties. But the naval action 
had reduced Japan's hope for a climactic battle to the dim hope of a deathbed 
gamble. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Tarmac runways on Saipan and Tinian could launch a B-29 every 14 
seconds, which would soon make a mockery of Japan's boast that its home islands 
were immune from attack. 
</P>
<P>
 A year and a week after Tinian had been secured, a fugitive Japanese soldier 
named Kizo Imai, who had been hiding in the jungle awaiting a rescue that never 
came, peered through the leaves at an unusual sight. A sole B-29 illuminated by 
floodlights in the darkness was surrounded by photographers snapping the plane 
and its crew. Imai wondered what was going on. 
</P>
<P>
 The bomber's nose bore the name "Enola Gay" for the pilot's mother. It was 
bound for Hiroshima and the dawn of a new and dangerous day.

NIGERIA, AFRICA'S OTHER GIANT, STUMBLES ON RUTTED PATHWAY TO DEMOCRACY; VOTING: 
THURSDAY, JUNE 23, IS THE FIRST ANNIVERSARY OF THE DAY THE MILITARY NULLIFIED 
PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK FRITZ, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 South Africa holds a free election and installs a democracy. A former 
political prisoner becomes president. History is written with a happy flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria, with twice as many people, tries for democracy but stumbles, tumbling 
deeper into dictatorship. The apparent president becomes a fugitive with a 
price on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a year separated these two decidedly different African elections. In 
between, the United States abandoned the smoldering shell of Somalia, wars 
waxed and waned in Liberia and Angola, and a sleek French jet carrying the 
president of Rwanda crashed mysteriously near his swimming pool, setting off a 
bloodletting of biblical proportions. 
</P>
<P>
 This Thursday is the first anniversary of the day the military decided to 
nullify a democratic presidential election in Nigeria, a nation of 90 million 
people that is home to one of every six black Africans. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the slow descent of Africa's most populous nation has been 
overshadowed by the spectacle of an entire continent careening from the 
inspiring to the stomach-churning, from the golden horizons of hope in South 
Africa to the red waves of horror in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Malawi's president-for-life was thrown out when he granted the first free 
election of his three decades in office. Ivory Coast's only post-colonial ruler 
died on the 34th anniversary of the day he led it to independence, prompting 
one distraught admirer to feed himself to the alligators in the presidential 
moat. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen West African nations buckled under pressure from Paris and devalued 
their common French-backed currency by half. That made their agricultural 
products more attractive abroad, but caused price increases for imported 
medicines and food. Riots and strikes resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Exploited for centuries by slavers, superpowers and its own corrupt rulers, 
forced into geographic configurations devised by colonialists, Africa has 
endured the most tumultuous 12 months since the Cold War's end rendered it 
strategically insignificant while offering the promise of reform and revival. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbing decline in Nigeria has largely provided background noise to the 
more spectacular developments in Somalia, Rwanda, Burundi and South Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigeria has styled itself as the economic, cultural and military bulwark of 
black Africa for decades, and has periodically lobbied for a permanent seat on 
the U.N. Security Council. But when Nelson Mandela was elected president of 
South Africa in April, Nigerians seemed to realize their claim to leadership 
was illusory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt thoroughly humiliated when Mandela took over, remembering that Nigeria 
is still in the throes of a seized democratic mandate," said Claude Ake, a 
prominent sociologist. 
</P>
<P>
 Retired Gen. Shehu Mus Yar'Adua felt pangs of envy when once-hated South 
Africa suddenly became the black-led beacon of the region. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not sleep on the day Nelson Mandela was sworn into office," said 
Yar'Adua, who was No. 2 man in the last Nigerian military government to 
willingly give up power, in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Nigerians were embarrassed and aghast when Vice President Al Gore apparently 
ignored the current military strongman, Gen. Sani Abacha, at Mandela's 
inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the sole source of national pride these days, Nigeria's first-ever 
appearance in the World Cup soccer tournament, has been tainted by democracy's 
failure. Washington would not grant visas to Nigerian officials and reduced the 
number of flights for Nigerian soccer fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have lost in prestige and influence on a global scale," said Clement 
Nwankwo, head of the opposition Constitutional Rights Project. "You can now 
safely assume that no one will take Nigeria seriously with a non-racial South 
Africa." 
</P>
<P>
 After a decade of corrupt, incompetent military rule, Nigeria was poised in 
1993 to complete the transition to civilian rule begun by Abacha's predecessor, 
Gen. Ibrahim Babangida. 
</P>
<P>
 Moshood K. O. Abiola, a flamboyant media and transportation magnate with three 
wives, a platoon of mistresses and close ties to the military, apparently was 
elected president June 12, 1993, with surprising support that overcame the 
nation's ethnic and religious divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Nigerians who had been cynical about the election were suddenly elated 
when Abiola beat the candidate considered more favored by the military, even 
though Abiola suffers in comparisons with Mandela. 
</P>
<P>
 South Africa's new president spent 27 years in prison under apartheid. When 
the going got rough in Nigeria, Abiola would flee in his private jet, saying he 
feared for his life. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 15, Babangida apparently had second thoughts and said no more returns 
would be released. On June 23, he annulled the election he had spent years 
organizing. Strikes and riots followed, leaving an estimated 200 people dead 
over three days. 
</P>
<P>
 Plagued by infighting within his military circle, he stepped down Aug. 26. 
Abacha promptly threw out the civilian administrator Babangida had left as his 
successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Abacha, aloof, heavy-handed and lacking Babangida's political knack for 
putting a positive spin on the military's manipulations, has managed to do the 
unthinkable: make people miss the previous dictator. 
</P>
<P>
 He clumsily dissolved the elected federal, state and local governments 
Babangida had installed, replaced governors with soldiers and wiped out years 
of market reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 As the election anniversary approached, Abacha jailed at least two dozen 
former senators and human rights activists, closed newspapers and tightened 
visa requirements on foreign journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 11, the day before the election anniversary, he sent soldiers to 
arrest Abiola, who had sworn himself in as president. Abiola had fled to a 
secret location in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Abacha also put a price, but not much of one, on the billionaire's head: 
50,000 naira, about $2,300 at the official rate and $1,000 on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
 The general went on television June 12 and echoed the unfulfilled promise of 
uniformed predecessors: Be patient. Democracy will come, someday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want is simple trust from the people," said Lt. Gen. Oladipo Diya, 
No. 2 in Abacha's junta. 
</P>
<P>
 Few Nigerians believe their leaders any longer. Before the 1993 election was 
voided, the military spokesman, Gen. Fred Chijuka, spoke of what a fine one it 
had been. 
</P>
<P>
 While spasms of war and political unrest draw attention to Africa, the 
continent's deeper problems, epitomized by Nigeria, quietly cripple its 
long-term prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 Sub-Saharan Africa has been the only region in the world to regress 
economically since 1980. Average per capita income fell from $570 annually in 
1980 to $350 in 1992, the World Bank said in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite belt-tightening ordered by the World Bank, the region's foreign debt 
inched up from $194 billion in 1992 to $199 billion last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of Africans classified as undernourished by the U.N. Food and 
Agriculture Organization rose from 129 million in 1979-81 to 175 million in 
1988-90. 
</P>
<P>
 There was something in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for 
everybody, except sub-Saharan Africa. It is the only region that stands to lose 
money on the deal: $2.7 billion a year, the World Bank estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, lenders and investors are lining up to pour money into South Africa, 
which is, for now, a showcase African democracy. 
</P>
<P>
 Abiola, ever the businessman, pointed out early this month that membership in 
the global family of democracies has its privileges. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nigeria does not offer a foreign investor the kind of attraction which the 
same investor could find in a democratic, and apparently more stable, South 
Africa," he said.

NEBRASKA TOWN TAXES ITSELF TO ATTRACT AIR SERVICE, BUT GOAL IS GROUNDED; 
TRANSPORTATION: SIDNEY HAS BEEN WITHOUT A CARRIER SINCE MARCH, WHEN THE ONLY 
ONE WILLING TO SERVE THE AREA PULLED OUT -- SUBSIDY OR NO SUBSIDY. PROBLEM 
TYPIFIES SITUATION IN RURAL AMERICA.

 The wind-swept airport on the plains south of this little town is a lot 
quieter these days. 
</P>
<P>
 No longer do the small Beech 1900 turboprops of GP Express Airlines roar off 
toward Denver or Alliance, Neb., twice daily. As of early March, the 6,000 
residents here in the arid hills of western Nebraska were erased from the 
country's aviation map when the company determined that its service made no 
economic sense, even with large subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 Fewer than two people a day, on average, used the service. But those who did 
say they will miss it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't intend to drive that far," said Vinnie Olinger, 73, who flew 165 
miles to Denver several times a year to see family. "People get a little bit 
older, and they don't trust themselves in traffic." 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney's problem is typical of hundreds of small communities that have 
struggled to retain air service in an era of deregulation when the big airlines 
pulled out of small markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Yearly, Congress debates programs such as the Essential Air Services Program, 
which has subsidized air service to hundreds of small cities and towns since 
1977. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate is under way again this year. President Clinton's fiscal 1995 
budget recommended tightening eligibility requirements and cutting the subsidy 
to $25.6 million, continuing a steady downsizing of the program that at its 
peak in 1981 cost $86.3 million. The House Appropriations Committee voted to 
kill the program, but some funding is likely to survive. 
</P>
<P>
 Each time, the debate is framed this way: In an era of tight budgets and good 
highways, can the country afford to subsidize air service for rural America? Is 
the service really needed? 
</P>
<P>
 People in Sidney were so convinced the answer was yes that they were willing 
to tax themselves to keep their air service alive. 
</P>
<P>
 The town was one of 26 communities that lost their Essential Air Service 
subsidies in a major cutback in fiscal 1989 and 1990. Sidney's subsidy rose 
above the cutoff point of $200 per passenger, and the last plane left town on 
Dec. 31, 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 But in 1988 the town had approved a half-cent local sales tax to raise about 
$300,000 a year for community development. After Sidney agreed to designate up 
to $42,000 a year from these funds for air service, GP Express agreed to 
include Sidney on its route from Chadron and Alliance in Nebraska to Denver. 
Planes began landing again in June, 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager Marlin Ferguson said the public consistently supported the 
subsidy, and the City Council voted year after year to keep it flowing. "We 
haven't had a lot of protest against it," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But misfortune overtook Sidney again this year, when GP Express decided to 
drop Sidney, subsidy or no subsidy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It continues to bother me that smaller communities continue to get screwed," 
said George Poullos, owner of GP Express. But he said he had to face economic 
reality. His airline was growing briskly, and he could not afford to use an 
aircraft as large as the 19-seat Beech 1900 for such a small market. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision-makers in Sidney are searching for another small airline that 
would be willing to take their money. 
</P>
<P>
 Why would a small town be willing to pay extra taxes to maintain a service 
used by only about 45 people a month? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer boils down to fear. The town's economic and political leaders say 
they are afraid that Sidney will be unable to attract new industry unless it 
can advertise that it has air service. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that businessmen were major users of air service. Several executives 
acknowledged that they usually drove the 165 miles to Denver's Stapleton 
Airport rather than trust the vagaries of a puddle-jumper operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were probably as guilty as anyone in not using the service," said Jim 
Beardsley, catalogue director of Cabela's, the giant retailer of outdoor-sports 
gear that dominates Sidney's economic life. "But we couldn't live with less 
than 100% dependability in an airline." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who did use the service did so sparingly. Tim Ryder, plant manager for 
Prestolite, said his company used GP Express once or twice a week. Elimination 
of the service "doesn't affect us at all," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ryder, like the rest of the business community, said he believes the air 
service is a necessity. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that the service is gone, "it probably makes the whole town less 
attractive for industry," Ryder said. "If I was an industry and I was looking 
at a small Nebraska city, that is one obstacle that wasn't there in the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Sidney, a way station on the original transcontinental railroad, was built by 
transportation. Today more than 100 freight trains a day rumble through town, 
and Interstate 80 gives trucks and cars easy access.

WEDDING GUNS, NOW THAT HAS A RING; MARRIAGE: OFFBEAT NUPTIALS HAVE BECOME AN 
AMERICAN TRADITION. THE ONLY RULE THAT STILL APPLIES IS THE PRESENCE OF A BRIDE 
AND A GROOM.

<P>
 It's half-past June, and you've had it with throwing bridal showers, catching 
bouquets and eating white cake. If you hear one more band play "Celebration" 
one more time, you will stay single for life. 
</P>
<P>
 You, my weddinged-out friend, have been going to the wrong weddings. 
</P>
<P>
 You probably missed the ceremony where two Humane Society supporters walked 
down the aisle in Oregon with dogs as their flower girl and ring bearer. Or 
when an Alaskan member of the National Rifle Assn. exchanged semiautomatic 
pistols with his bride instead of rings. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, offbeat weddings have become an American tradition. And though this 
is the favorite month for nuptials -- about 252,000 couples married in June 
last year -- any time seems the right time to, say, exchange vows under water. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only one rule among the wacky wedding crowd: If you have thought of 
it, it has been done. Weddings you have never thought of have been done. 
Weddings you cannot describe with a straight face have been done. 
</P>
<P>
 For some, it's a matter of mixing wedlock with pleasure. When people say that 
marriage is a big step, they probably are not referring to those sky-diving 
couples who marry in midair. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, two runners stopped in the middle of the New York City Marathon -- 
dressed in cutaway bridal attire -- to pledge their love as TV cameras rolled 
and sweaty competitors raced past. 
</P>
<P>
 (According to etiquette, of course, that bride did not sweat. She blushed.) 
</P>
<P>
 Computer-philes have held on-line weddings, where the bride and groom type in 
their vows as friends and family across the country join the ceremony via home 
computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Romantic? Ridiculous? It depends on your point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 Others have used weddings to proclaim their allegiance to a place. 
</P>
<P>
 One bride walked down the snack aisle at a 7-Eleven, where she and her fiance 
were working when they met. Two bikers said their vows in front of leather-clad 
comrades at a Harley-Davidson motorcycle shop. A couple fond of the old West 
arrived for their ceremony on horseback, pledged their love in cowboy hats, and 
left in a covered wagon. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there are those who pay homage to places not found on any map: One 
Indiana bride wore ruby red slippers as she walked down a "yellow brick road" 
runner before friends dressed as Munchkins. 
</P>
<P>
 No study has been done to see if these couples stay together any more than the 
American average -- which now stands at a dismal 50%, according to the National 
Center for Health Statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Inclement weather has produced an offbeat wedding subcategory: The 
we-could-not-get-there affair, courtesy of snowstorms, avalanches, hurricanes, 
you name it. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, an avalanche blocked a Colorado bride and groom from reaching their 
wedding site. While they went back to town to be married, their friends at the 
mountain inn drank champagne and ate wedding cake without them. 
</P>
<P>
 A sub-subcategory -- the soggy wedding -- was swollen last year by the 
Midwest's flood of the century. 
</P>
<P>
 Humor was needed to survive nuptials where a portable toilet was among the 
wedding gifts; where the liquor flowed but the running water did not; where the 
bride wore military fatigues and left for the honeymoon in a military Jeep; 
where flooding turned starched bridal gowns into sodden, pearl-seeded lumps of 
cloth and put bakeries and florists under water. 
</P>
<P>
 "For wetter, for worse," read one wedding party T-shirt in Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
 Some classic wedding spectacles have involved police. 
</P>
<P>
 A bride in Kentucky went on a $1,500 shoplifting spree the morning of her 
wedding, gathering items that anyone would need -- a dress for her, a suit for 
him, a video camera to film the event. The wedding was delayed a few hours 
while she and her sister posted bond. 
</P>
<P>
 The light-fingered bride might have avoided jail altogether if she had 
followed the lead of another famous bride: Marla Maples. 
</P>
<P>
 Pressing the "something borrowed" tradition to the limit, the woman who wed 
Donald Trump last December persuaded jewelry merchant Harry Winston to lend her 
a $2-million diamond tiara for the event. 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, friends. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest one despair at the rash of publicity-seekers and the glut of wedding 
plans gone awry, rest assured that truly heartwarming weddings still resonate 
above the din. And love can survive even the test of time. 
</P>
<P>
 One pair of high school sweethearts eloped in 1927 at age 14 and 16, but their 
parents annulled the marriage. After 64 years apart, two marriages, children 
and other lives, they met again after both were widowed and remarried a few 
months later. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought of her often over the years," Paul Tarvin said on the eve of his 
second marriage to Nina Downs. "After all, she was my first love."

ROBOT PROBES MYSTERY OF LUSITANIA'S SINKING; WORLD WAR I: ROBOT EXAMINES 
WRECKAGE OF PASSENGER SHIP SUNK BY GERMANS IN 1915, DOOMING NEARLY 1,200. 
</P>

<P>
 The commander of the German U-boat couldn't believe his luck. Just when he 
thought the massive steamer was going to escape along the south coast of 
Ireland, it turned sharply toward him. 
</P>
<P>
 The British liner RMS Lusitania, on her way from New York to Liverpool, 
England, with 1,959 passengers aboard, couldn't have run a better course if it 
voluntarily intended to come into torpedo range, Walther Schwieger told a 
friend. From 750 yards, he fired a single torpedo. It was 2:10 p.m. on May 7, 
1915. 
</P>
<P>
 Eighteen minutes later, the ship hit the bottom of the Celtic Sea, off 
Ireland. Only 764 people were saved. The 1,195 victims included 94 children and 
infants. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lusitania has remained shrouded in mystery and controversy ever since. 
</P>
<P>
 Why were there two explosions rather than one? Why did she sink so fast? Was 
the Lusitania, as Germany claimed, secretly transporting munitions that ignited 
on impact? 
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of answering some of these questions, a team of scientists sponsored 
by the National Geographic Society explored the shattered vessel with three 
remote-controlled underwater vehicles for nearly two weeks last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Passengers boarding the Lusitania at New York's Pier 54 on May 1, 1915, knew 
of Germany's threat to sink ships in the war zone around the British Isles. The 
two nations had been fighting for nine months. Some travelers may even have 
seen the ominous notice published in newspapers that morning, advising them of 
the risk. But few imagined that a civilized nation would attack an unarmed 
passenger steamer without warning. 
</P>
<P>
 German authorities, however, now saw the great liner as a threat. They accused 
the British government of using the Lusitania to carry munitions and other 
contraband across the Atlantic. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2:10 p.m. on May 7, Leslie Morton, an 18-year-old lookout on the 
Lusitania's bow, spotted thin lines of foam racing toward the ship. "Torpedoes 
coming on the starboard side!" he shouted through a megaphone, thinking the 
bubbles came from two projectiles. The impact sounded like a "million-ton 
hammer hitting a steam boiler a hundred feet high," one passenger said. A 
second, more powerful explosion followed, sending a geyser of water, coal and 
debris high above the deck. 
</P>
<P>
 Listing immediately to starboard, the liner began to sink rapidly at the bow, 
propellers rising to the surface as passengers tumbled down her slanted decks. 
Lifeboats on the port side were hanging too far inboard to be readily launched, 
those on the starboard side too far out to be easily boarded. Several 
overfilled boats spilled occupants into the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The huge vessel disappeared under the waves, leaving behind a churning jumble 
of swimmers, corpses, deck chairs, oars and a large mass of wreckage. Looking 
back upon the scene from his submarine, apparently even Schwieger was appalled. 
He later called it the most horrible sight he had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans were outraged by the attack, which claimed the lives of 123 of their 
fellow citizens. Newspapers called the torpedoing "deliberate murder" and a 
"foul deed." Politicians, including former President Theodore Roosevelt, 
demanded reprisals against Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Within days of the sinking, German sympathizers in New York came up with a 
conspiracy theory: The British Admiralty, they said, had deliberately exposed 
Lusitania to harm, hoping she would be attacked and thus draw the United States 
into the war. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest puzzle of all was why the liner sank so fast. Newspapers 
at the time speculated that the torpedo had struck war materiel in a cargo 
hold, causing a mighty internal explosion -- the secondary blast reported by 
survivors. Divers later reported a huge hole in the port side of the bow 
opposite where munitions would have been stored. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to settle the issue once and for all, National Geographic sent its 
robot vehicle, Jason, from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution in 
Massachusetts, down to photograph the damage. But when its cameras swept across 
the hold, researchers got a big surprise: There was no hole, no sign of 
explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 She looked more like a junkyard than a luxury liner when first photographed 
last July. Plunging bow first into 295 feet of water, the 785-foot-long ship 
slammed into the bottom while her stern was still at the surface. The force of 
the impact crumpled the stem of her bow and cracked open her hull amidships. 
After she crashed down on her starboard side, her decks collapsed, spilling 
debris onto the sea floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The liner's giant funnels have long since turned to rust, her lifeboats have 
rotted away, and human remains have been consumed by sea creatures. 
</P>
<P>
 Seeing the name for the first time was like reading a tombstone: Here lies the 
LUSITANIA. An eerie marine growth covers her steel hull, and her superstructure 
has turned into ghostly wreckage. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions about her cargo have haunted the Lusitania since the day the ship 
went down. The Germans have always claimed she was carrying illegal munitions 
-- which, in fact, she was. The manifest for her last voyage reads like a 
contraband shopping list. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the National Geographic investigation suggested, such war materiel did 
not cause the secondary blast that sent the Lusitania to the bottom. So what 
did? 
</P>
<P>
 A more likely possibility was a coal-dust explosion. The German torpedo struck 
the liner's starboard side about 10 feet below the waterline, rupturing one of 
the long coal bunkers that stretched along both sides. If that bunker, mostly 
empty by the end of the voyage, contained a large amount of volatile coal dust, 
the torpedo might have ignited it. 
</P>
<P>
 Though relations among nations have healed in the years since, the horror and 
fascination of the Lusitania have never diminished. Exploration of her was like 
a somber return to the scene of a crime. With high-technology tools researchers 
searched for the "smoking gun" that might solve her riddles. But the truth 
about the sinking of the Lusitania remains as murky as the dark Celtic Sea.

ACCIDENTAL ARCHEOLOGISTS DIG UP TREASURE TROVES OF ANCIENT ARTIFACTS; HISTORY: 
VALUABLE DISCOVERIES ARE OFTEN MADE ON PRIVATE PROPERTY BY UNWITTING 
EXCAVATORS. BUT REGULATING SERENDIPITOUS FINDS IS USUALLY DIFFICULT.

 Abir Nassee was battering a corner of the mud-and-concrete wall in his Old 
City art gallery, trying to clear out a niche so that he could install a safe. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly his sledgehammer struck something that refused to crumble. Puzzled, 
Nassee cleared away rubble. 
</P>
<P>
 Behind the new opening in the shop's wall he discovered a large, 
brownish-white stone, about 3 feet wide and 2 feet high. Nassee suspected, and 
authorities later confirmed, that it was part of the wall that had surrounded 
Jerusalem at the time of King Solomon, about 3,000 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Half a world away, writer Paul Elliott was planting vegetables outside his 
home in a Virginia suburb of Washington, D.C., when he began to unearth 
fragments of strangely smooth, reddish-brown stones. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the usual harvest, Elliott's garden yielded a bumper crop of quartzite 
remnants from 4,000-year-old tools. 
</P>
<P>
 A gallery owner and a gardener hardly fit the romantic image of Indiana Jones 
poking around pyramids or searching for a mysterious scroll. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in fact, said George E. Stuart, the National Geographic Society 
archeologist, "many discoveries, often valuable ones, are made by accident." 
</P>
<P>
 Atop a hill near Rome, picnickers spot the ruins of a town that had been razed 
after a battle in 492 B.C. and sought by archeologists for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 On a field in Suffolk County, England, a retired gardener unearths a box 
containing gold bracelets, decorative silver tableware and nearly 15,000 Roman 
coins -- believed to have been buried by a wealthy family 16 centuries earlier 
and now worth more than $2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Such accidental archeology offers a variety of rewards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I sit in awe, looking at the stones of the old wall," said Abir 
Nassee. "I am excited to think that my ancestors maybe helped to build it." 
</P>
<P>
 An excavation of Elliott's yard "changed a lot of what we knew about 
prehistoric life in the area," said Mike Johnson, an archeologist for Fairfax 
County, Va. "We thought people had stayed primarily along the rivers, but this 
put them smack dab in the interior." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Britain's treasure-trove law, the Suffolk gardener may pocket the 
financial gains from his cache. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their value and importance, however, chance discoveries evoke pleas 
for caution from professional archeologists. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must remember that the real value is not in the item itself, but in what 
it tells us about the past," said Rudolph Cohen, deputy director of the Israeli 
Antiquities Authority. "That story can be lost if the discovery is not handled 
properly." 
</P>
<P>
 Proper handling generally means leaving the site undisturbed -- at least until 
an experienced archeologist can examine it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people just pick up what they find, willy-nilly, it's very hard to tell 
anything," warned Frank McManamon, chief of the U.S. National Park Service's 
archeological assistance division. Many artifacts, he said, "have been 
witnesses to the unfolding of human history. But they become mute when divorced 
from their original context." 
</P>
<P>
 Most information, McManamon said, comes from studying the relationships of 
objects -- to each other, to the soil, to the people who used them. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, tests on a pristine fragment of a prehistoric bowl may reveal 
what plants were kept in the bowl. This, in turn, will help scientists 
determine what the users of the bowl ate. The strata of ground in which the 
bowl was found offer clues to its age. 
</P>
<P>
 The potential for great gain and loss in serendipitous discoveries is 
illustrated by one of the archeological marvels of the 20th Century, the 
terra-cotta army of Xi'an in southeastern China. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1974, peasants digging a well on a commune near the site uncovered a tunnel 
filled with life-size clay models of male heads, pieces of arms and torsos, 
metal arrowheads and other items. 
</P>
<P>
 Stories are told of children taking pottery home to play with and of peasants 
offering the clay heads and other artifacts for roadside sale for $2.50 each. 
Fortunately, there were no buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 The peasants had been instructed at commune meetings to report all chance 
discoveries to authorities. In time, archeologists excavated the site. What 
emerged were lifelike soldiers and horses in battle formation, made 22 
centuries earlier to guard the tomb of China's first emperor, Qin Shi Huang. 
</P>
<P>
 China isn't alone in strictly regulating ancient finds. Most countries with 
vast archeological treasures, such as Israel, Italy, Egypt and Mexico, 
generally forbid private excavations and make all antiquities the property of 
the state, including those found on private property. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. laws, tightened after a wave of looting and desecration of Native 
American burial sites, ban the removal, buying and selling of artifacts from 
public lands and grave sites. 
</P>
<P>
 But for the most part, Americans may keep what they find on their own 
property. In the United States and other countries, looting and vandalism 
continue because the laws are hard to enforce. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we really need," said McManamon, "is greater cooperation between the 
public and professionals." 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of cooperation occurred after Paul Elliott made his back yard 
discovery. He informed the Fairfax County archeology office, which organized a 
dig in which schoolchildren, college students and other volunteers 
participated. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal, state and local agencies, as well as the Society for American 
Archeology and other groups, are making many such efforts to work with 
communities. The Arkansas Archeological Society offers seminars and field 
programs for interested amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best answer would seem to lie in public education," the National 
Geographic Society's George Stuart wrote, "so that people can know of our rich 
collective past and the threats to it."

 A 9-year-old boy spent about 15 minutes hanging upside down in a Ferris wheel 
car until a police officer climbed up and rescued him. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua Handy wasn't hurt Thursday night as he dangled from the top of the 
35-foot wheel at an amusement park. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Chris Taylor scaled the side of the Ferris wheel without a safety line 
and held the boy until firemen put Joshua into the bucket of a hook-and-ladder 
truck and lowered him to the ground.

FEAR OVER PERSONAL SAFETY GIVES RISE TO HARD TIMES IN EGYPT TOURIST CITY; 
VALLEY OF THE KINGS: LUXOR LIVES BY TOURISM AND, FOR NOW AT LEAST, TOURISM IS 
DEAD, KILLED BY A CAMPAIGN OF VIOLENCE BY ISLAMIC FUNDAMENTALISTS.

<P>
 It's a rare day when Ahmed Soliman has a guest at the Amon Elgazira, his tiny 
hotel near the Valley of the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahmud el-Gillany Hassan used to take tourists on the Nile every day under the 
billowing sails of his felucca, "Karen." Now he goes 10 days without a 
customer. 
</P>
<P>
 The story is the same with Abdel-Rahman, who rents donkeys to take tourists 
from the Nile to the tombs and temples in the Valley of the Kings, and guide 
Gaber Abd-el-Rady Ahmed-el-Kawamly, who tells them what they're seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's so sad now, and it's not our nature," Soliman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxor lives by tourism and, for now at least, tourism is dead, killed by a 
campaign of violence by Islamic fundamentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Soliman employs two people in addition to his family in his five-room hotel 
and is trying not to lay them off. He even hustles for taxi fares in his old 
Peugeot to earn enough to feed his three children and the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "What can I do?" Soliman asked. "They go one month, two months without pay. I 
have to go out and get money to pay them." 
</P>
<P>
 This is what two years of terrorist attacks have brought Egyptians, especially 
those in cities like Luxor with little industry except tourism. Radicals bent 
on destroying Egypt's largely secular system and installing an Islamic regime 
have hit tourism as the top money-earning enterprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Four foreign tourists are among more than 360 people killed in the violence. 
Hundreds of thousands of potential visitors have gone elsewhere, depriving the 
struggling economy of billions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 It was in Luxor that the violence began, in June, 1992: a rock-throwing 
incident or two, a bomb the size of a large firecracker near the Karnak temple 
complex, an explosive of the same size thrown at a French tourist bus. 
</P>
<P>
 The people of Luxor quickly made clear they were offering no support to the 
militants, so the violence moved north. Peace has reigned in Luxor for two 
years, but still the tourists stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here it is very safe," said Hassan the boatman, sitting on a bench in the 
shade of a Nile-side tree. "We just don't know why the people stopped coming. 
We are all against what is happening in the country. We help the police. There 
is no problem here." 
</P>
<P>
 Like everyone else in town, Hassan believes tourists will return. But when? 
</P>
<P>
 Luxor, 350 miles south of Cairo, is a gentle place where the worst an outsider 
should expect is to be conned out of half a dollar by a smooth-talking 
horse-cart driver. It's always been a dream for cultural tourists, visitors 
interested in the array of temples and tombs built when Luxor was mighty 
Thebes, capital of ancient Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 But today's Luxor is a lonely paradise, enjoyed by a few Japanese tourists, 
fewer English and Germans, all taking advantage of fantastic tour bargains. 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the long lines of sightseers leading to King Tut's tomb in the Valley 
of the Kings. Majestic Nile cruisers, once packed with foreigners on the run 
from Luxor south to Aswan, now carry Egyptians lured by cut-rate fares. 
</P>
<P>
 Business has been so bad that Luxor's largest luxury hotel, the Isis, offered 
Egyptians and foreign residents Easter-weekend rates of 152 Egyptian pounds, 
including air fare from Cairo. That's $45. 
</P>
<P>
 A slightly lower-scale establishment offered two days and a night, with 
transfers, tours and a complimentary bottle of wine for one Egyptian pound -- 
30 cents -- on payment of $49 air fare. The normal round-trip air fare for 
residents is about $58. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotel managers talk of closing until things improve. 
</P>
<P>
 Telling evidence of terrorism's toll lies at the Nile's east bank, down two 
flights of steps across the corniche from Luxor Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 A complex built there in the good times before 1992 consists of a 
multimillion-dollar tourist center and 50 boutiques. 
</P>
<P>
 The tourist center has yet to be inaugurated. Of the 50 shops, four are open.

'FASHIONABLY FAT' BRITON STUMPS FOR THE PLUMP; TRENDS: DAWN FRENCH'S 'BIG IS 
BEAUTIFUL' MESSAGE SEEMS TO BE CATCHING ON. MAGAZINES AND LATE-NIGHT TELEVISION 
HAVE BEGUN FEATURING VOLUPTUOUS WOMEN IN SEXY POSES. BUT NOT EVERYONE IS 
CONVINCED.

<P>
 Forget the wispy waif, the sylphlike child-woman, the bag of bones on the 
catwalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Fear of fat is no longer fashionable in Britain, home of Twiggy in the '60s 
and the waif Kate Moss in the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn French, Britain's nicer, more appealing version of Roseanne Arnold, is 
funny, fat and famous. She doesn't want to change herself. Instead, the actress 
and television comedian wants to persuade a diet-addicted world that big is 
beautiful, fat is fun. 
</P>
<P>
 The politics of plump have caught on in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 Glossy fashion magazines, including British Esquire, and late-night television 
have featured photographs of voluptuous women. Swaddled in gauzy wraps, French, 
a size 20, has appeared in tableaux styled after the painters Rubens and 
Titian, who celebrated cumulous billows of flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big women are sexier than thin ones," French pronounced in She magazine. "We 
pump more estrogen, have higher sex drives and fantasize more. Being big is a 
sign of fertility, of voluptuous sensuality, a love of life." 
</P>
<P>
 French, 36, is a persuasive billboard for her cause. 
</P>
<P>
 She may call herself "a short, squat Devonshire dumpling," but she is 
gorgeous: peaches-and-cream complexion, huge dark eyes, tumbling auburn curls, 
a bright smile and seductive voice. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something extremely delicious about flesh, and women who are 
comfortable about having it are very alluring," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some men have been moved to "out" themselves, confessing that they prefer 
comfortably cushioned women to fashionable coat hangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Big women are bollards that one can tie oneself to in the storm of life, 
rather than reeds blowing in the wind," author Will Self wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 French has inspired many British women, particularly the ample ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she should be voted in as prime minister," declared Angie Le Mar, 27, 
a size 14 comedian. Women larger than size 10, Le Mar said, "have been getting 
a raw deal for so long, and she has had the guts to speak up." 
</P>
<P>
 "Dawn French is absolutely brilliant," said Patricia Hill, who was shopping at 
French's clothing shop in north London. "I feel more confident because of her. 
I think, if she can look great, I can too." 
</P>
<P>
 The shop is named 1647 in honor of the 47% of British women who are size 16 -- 
U.S. 14 -- or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all large women are converted. 
</P>
<P>
 French's television show extolling the value of voluptuousness ended with 
singer Alison Moyet condemning size-ism, great or small. The rebuke was her 
condition for participating. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're talking a lot of crap," said Moyet, who is large herself. "What you're 
basically saying is that now we've got to replace one stereotype with the 
other. I'm sorry, but that's a load of bollocks." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fat cow!" French retorted. 
</P>
<P>
 Susan Miller, a 27-year-old teacher who aspires to lose 45 pounds, does not 
buy French's message that fat is fabulous. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think fat is horrible," she said while taking a break at a London gym. 
However, Miller said, she "wouldn't want to look like that Kate Moss -- all 
bones, no boobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Melanie Smith, a 33-year-old bank clerk who is comfortable as a size 16, said 
at a London wine bar: "I would never say that big is better. I just think big 
is as good as small or medium, so long as you are reasonably healthy. I 
wouldn't diet for cosmetic reasons, but I would if my weight was affecting my 
health." 
</P>
<P>
 All women, of whatever size, need to be more self-accepting, said Mary Evans 
Young, founder of Diet Breakers, a national anti-diet organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we just focus on the Dawn Frenches -- and fat women are treated 
appallingly -- we ignore that every woman is brought up not to like her body," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all women look like Dawn French and not all women look like Kate Moss. 
The first step is to accept yourself as you are."

A YEAR AFTER TRANSPLANTS, CASEY THRIVES; PENNSYLVANIA: A GRATEFUL GOVERNOR MET 
HEART AND LIVER DONOR'S MOTHER RECENTLY. HE CALLS HER "INCREDIBLY GENEROUS." 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A book, a conversation and another man's death all fell into line to give Gov. 
Robert P. Casey another chance at life. 
</P>
<P>
 A risky chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't take anything for granted anymore," said Casey, whose disease-ravaged 
heart and liver were replaced in a rare double-transplant operation a year ago. 
"When I get up in the morning and the sun's shining, I feel pretty good." 
</P>
<P>
 The 62-year-old governor, who is concluding two terms in office, underwent 
surgery June 14, 1993. He returned to office in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey says he feels much improved though not completely recovered. His doctors 
at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center say he is doing well. Both 
organs function, they say; neither has shown signs of rejection for months. 
</P>
<P>
 He must take daily medication to prevent rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey had amyloidosis, a hereditary condition that was destroying his liver 
and heart. He thought it was fatal. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he received a copy of a memoir by Dr. Thomas Starzl, director of the 
medical center's transplant institute. He called Starzl to thank him for the 
book and asked if the doctor knew anything about amyloidosis. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said, 'I can cure it with a liver transplant,' " Casey said. "Up to that 
point, as far as I knew, no cure, no treatment, always fatal." 
</P>
<P>
 As Casey recalls the days and hours preceding his operation, the swing of 
emotion he felt at the time remains visible a year later. 
</P>
<P>
 Learning that the liver transplant he expected would be accompanied by a heart 
transplant, Casey was resolute. He got the news while eating cheesecake in a 
hospital room full of somber doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had a bit -- and I mean this -- I never had any doubt," he said. "In 
light of what they told me, I was dead-ended. So it's the surgery or the 
alternative. Let me tell you, the surgery looked pretty darn good." 
</P>
<P>
 Then a compatible heart and lung became available, donated by the family of 
Michael Lucas, 34, who was fatally beaten in an attack police said was linked 
to drug dealing. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey said he met Lucas' mother about two months ago in Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very emotional thing," he said. "Here's a woman who's lost two sons 
to violence -- one son was shot, the other was beaten to death. 
</P>
<P>
 "She regards her son's life continuing in my life and what I do," he said. 
"That, to me, is incredibly generous, when you think of all the circumstances."

 A New Orleans advertising executive lost his bid to play bass guitar with the 
Rolling Stones on one song in exchange for a $50,000 charity donation, but 
local charities still came out winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Herb Montalbano Jr. said Friday that Stones publicist Fran Curtis told him the 
band had nixed his performance, but he decided to give away the $50,000 anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I can help answer some little kid's dream," he said, even though his 
dream of playing with the band remained just that. 
</P>
<P>
 Montalbano said he sent a check for $20,000 to Children's Hospital in New 
Orleans and will divide $30,000 among several other charities, including the 
Humane Society. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stones have included New Orleans on the list of cities they hope to play, 
but no date or location has been announced.

ALL TOGETHER NOW, FIREFLIES FLASH IN SYNC; SMOKY MOUNTAINS: EXPERT SAYS THE 
PATTERNS VARY FROM THOSE IN SOUTHEAST ASIA, WHERE THEY GET IN A TREE, FLASH IN 
UNISON, "SO IT LOOKS LIKE A CHRISTMAS TREE." 
</P>

<P>
 Every June for 40 years, members of the Faust family have watched their very 
own springtime light show from a darkened cabin porch in the Great Smoky 
Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 On the hill across the creek, a wave of light flows down the slope, stops, 
then starts over again at the top. 
</P>
<P>
 The light is the glow of hundreds and hundreds of fireflies, flashing in 
unison. 
</P>
<P>
 On the flat land nearby, their pattern is different. The fireflies flash 
simultaneously, on-and-off, five or six times, then stop for 15 or 20 seconds. 
Then they start over. On-and-off, on-and-off, all together. 
</P>
<P>
 So Lynn Faust was a little scornful when she read a magazine article saying 
the Western Hemisphere has no synchronous fireflies. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought maybe it wasn't synchrony, but it sure looks like it," the 
Knoxville resident said. 
</P>
<P>
 The magazine's editor put her in touch with John Copeland, an ethologist, or 
someone who studies creatures' patterns of behavior, at Georgia Southern 
University in Statesboro, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 When her message arrived, Copeland was roaming Southeast Asia studying what 
were thought to be the world's only synchronous fireflies. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidently, he could have stayed much closer to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing has been magical," Copeland said of the show in Tennessee. 
"At the height of the season, it takes your breath away." 
</P>
<P>
 Flashing is part of fireflies' breeding pattern, but the flashes are usually 
random and individual. 
</P>
<P>
 Copeland said the patterns of synchronization in the Smokies are different 
from those in Southeast Asia, where the fireflies get in a tree "and flash 
congregationally, so that it looks like a Christmas tree with lights flashing 
on and off." 
</P>
<P>
 In the Smokies the insects don't gather in trees and their blinking is not as 
precisely uniform. "But you can tell with the naked eye that they're flashing 
synchronously, or almost synchronously," Copeland said. 
</P>
<P>
 The firefly in question is photinus carolinus. Its range is along the 
Tennessee-North Carolina state line, which forms the spine of the Great Smoky 
Mountains National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Copeland and his colleague, Andy Moiseff of the University of Connecticut, 
began studying the Smoky Mountain fireflies only last summer, so there are 
things they don't yet understand. 
</P>
<P>
 Copeland said no one has determined what synchronization is for. 
</P>
<P>
 "Folks have hypothesized nine different reasons for the Southeast Asia 
synchrony, but nobody really knows," he said. "My guess is they do it to 
preserve the male pattern, so the females can discriminate the males of the 
species from other firefly species present at the same time. That's a guess." 
</P>
<P>
 As for why synchronization should show up in Tennessee and Southeast Asia, 
that's another thing he's not sure about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I knew," he said. "It evolved for some reason. The behavior costs 
energy and it's unusual. Therefore, it has to have some evolutionary meaning." 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility is that the females are sparse and unevenly distributed in the 
area, and unified behavior by the males is a way of amplifying their mating 
flash.

PINEY WOODS BEAR SCARS OF WINTER STORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN SEWELL, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four months after a vicious ice storm swept through much of the Deep South's 
piney woods, numerous forest casualties still lie where they fell, posing 
summer worries about bugs and fires. 
</P>
<P>
 The storm, unusual for both its geography and severity, raged Feb. 8-10, 
draping a heavy sheet of ice that proved especially damaging in northern 
Mississippi and parts of Louisiana, Arkansas and Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
 Utility poles, branches, even whole trees broke off with snaps as loud as 
rifle shots. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a once-in-a-lifetime storm," said Ham Williston, a 74-year-old timber 
owner, adding: "I hope it's once in a lifetime." 
</P>
<P>
 Timber damage in what is nearly universally described as a war zone in 
northern Mississippi has been estimated at $1.3 billion, based on surveys by 
state foresters right after the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 But the full economic impact on this vital industry in one of the poorest 
states won't be known for years, as growers watch whether less-heavily damaged 
trees can regenerate and produce a crop that commonly takes a quarter-century 
to mature. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly every forest in northern Mississippi suffered some damage. Although 
that's been a boon for removal services and mills, the salvage glut has driven 
down wood prices in the hardest-hit areas, and some small growers are giving 
wood away just to get rid of it. 
</P>
<P>
 As summer nears, state and federal foresters worry about all the damaged wood 
still to be salvaged. Forest fires are a threat, and the downed wood could 
become a prime breeding ground for such insects as the Southern pine beetle. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the mills are full," said Rick Harwell, the state forester for Lafayette 
County. "Most of the wood that's still on the ground . . . is starting to 
deteriorate pretty fast." 
</P>
<P>
 "There's just not enough crews that can get in there and get that downed 
timber. So you just have to leave it there," said Harris Kimble, sales and 
merchandising manager for the Curt Bean Lumber Co. of Glenwood, Ark. 
</P>
<P>
 With wood yards full, small amounts of damaged wood are simply being burned. A 
mound of ashes on the outskirts of this university town is more than 10 feet 
tall and growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of jacklegs in town, bootlegging it," said Charles Potts, who 
runs a tree-removal business from the nearby northern Mississippi town of Etta. 
"Everyone with a chain saw and a rope is a tree man now." 
</P>
<P>
 Even some undamaged wood has been cleared away to speed salvage, and 
tree-removal workers tell of traumatized homeowners cutting down trees in their 
yards in fear of future ice storms. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry officials say the national impact is small, although some local 
prices for wood have plunged 10% to 25%. Federal disaster aid is expected to 
repay most of local governments' cleanup costs, and growers can seek tax relief 
for casualty losses. 
</P>
<P>
 But foresters and growers say this year's damage will be felt for years. They 
predict impacts on newsprint and paper mills, lumber companies and makers of 
other construction materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have a gap in production," Williston said. "There's going to 
be a bind. The labor force is heavily dependent upon the pine resource." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Corbitt of the Mississippi Forestry Assn., a trade group based in 
Jackson, said almost one-fourth of the state's manufacturing jobs are related 
to timbering. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a significant part of the economy," Corbitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most devastating thing that I've ever been part of," said Jesse 
Phillips, publisher of the Oxford Eagle newspaper and owner of about 250 acres 
of timber. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides his economic losses, Phillips described the psychological hurt of 
losing 100-year-old trees from his yard. 
</P>
<P>
 But like many in this area, he's determined to rebound. "The thing that I said 
is to not dwell on the number of trees that are down, but look at the number of 
them that are still standing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mowing on his land the other day, he saw a striking sign of hope -- hundreds 
of pine seedlings.

 Frances Corey, a Los Angeles-based fashion executive once named by Fortune 
magazine as one of the top 30 women in American industry, has died at her

FLETCHER JONES; BUILT CHAIN OF CAR DEALERSHIPS IN 2 STATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fletcher Jones, a colorful car dealer who built a chain of agencies from a 
single Los Angeles lot, died Thursday in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 76.At the time of his death from what his family described as natural 
causes, Jones had amassed an organization of 11 domestic- and foreign-car 
dealerships in California and Nevada -- a long way from selling his first 
automobile for $70. 
</P>
<P>
 From his start at a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership in Los Angeles in 1950, his 
business grew rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 He became omnipresent in the early days of television advertising, smiling and 
cuddling puppies and kittens on camera and offering to send a portion of his 
auto sales profits to animal shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones opened his first Nevada dealership in Las Vegas in 1966. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Auto Age 500 reported his dealerships as the 12th largest group in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended the University of Southern California on a basketball scholarship 
and opened his first car lot with only $1,200 in capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include a son, Fletcher Jr., husband of Las Vegas Mayor Jan Jones; 
another son, Robert, daughters Stephanie and Bonnie and 10 grandchildren.

JAMES B. POLLACK; LEADING PLANETARY SCIENTIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 James B. Pollack, 55, luminary among the world's planetary scientists who 
helped formulate the theory of nuclear winter. Pollack discovered that Venus' 
clouds are made of sulfuric acid and his work led to the discovery that 
Saturn's rings are made of ice chunks.But he was best known for the nuclear 
winter theory. He, mentor Carl Sagan and three colleagues theorized that 
airborne soot from a nuclear war would block the sun's rays and drop 
temperatures below freezing worldwide. The theory was widely disputed and the 
scientists later conceded that they had overestimated the severity of a 
potential nuclear winter. Pollack joined NASA's Ames Research Center in 1970 
and won the center's greatest distinction when he was named an Ames Fellow. The 
New York native, who was educated at Princeton, UC Berkeley and Harvard, played 
a key role in many NASA planetary spacecraft missions, including the Viking and 
Voyager projects. Among his other endeavors was the study of volcanoes' effect 
on climate. On Monday in San Jose of spinal cancer.

DANA PARSONS: PEOPLE VS. O.J. SIMPSON? NOT ACCORDING TO THE EVIDENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANA PARSONS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's after 11 o'clock here in the office on Friday night, and I'm almost 
afraid to go home. Surely, we have time before midnight for one more bizarre 
twist in the O.J. Simpson saga. Surely there must be one more emotion that 
hasn't been tapped before this most unforgettable Friday finally slips away 
from us. 
</P>
<P>
 How many feelings can be tapped from one story? 
</P>
<P>
 You wanted shock? How about the LAPD announcing that O.J. was on the lam? 
</P>
<P>
 You wanted sinking despair? How about the nagging feeling that Simpson was 
going off to kill himself? 
</P>
<P>
 Anger? How about L.A. Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti ripping a judicial system that 
glossed over Simpson's spousal abuse history? 
</P>
<P>
 Pathos? How about Simpson's friend reading what sounded like O.J.'s suicide 
note? 
</P>
<P>
 Incredulity? How about freeway standees cheering and waving to O.J. as he 
passed by with police in pursuit, as if No. 32 were eluding tacklers at the 
Coliseum? 
</P>
<P>
 Anxiety? How about the ever-present danger during the surrealistic freeway 
crawl that Simpson would either shoot himself or that law enforcement would 
force a conclusion that would end in his death? And as darkness fell, weren't 
you praying for relief? Luckily, we got it when O.J. surrendered peacefully. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, easily identifiable emotions bubbled up all day long. 
</P>
<P>
 But the thought that recurred in my mind most often as the day unwound was the 
death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange, huh? I'd been thinking about it much of the week, after it became 
clear Simpson was the only real suspect in the murders of his ex-wife Nicole 
and her friend Ron Goldman. And I was thinking even more about it as 
Californians reacted to Simpson's day on the lam. 
</P>
<P>
 I may be wrong in imputing too many of my feelings to the general public, but 
wasn't there an overwhelming sense that we wanted O.J. to survive the day? 
Wasn't there a palpable pathetic sadness to his flight to avoid prosecution -- 
a hapless flight that went around in circles at 40 miles an hour on empty 
freeways as a reportedly numbed O.J. sat in the back seat and watched his world 
go by? Wasn't there the feeling that, even mindful of what crimes he may have 
committed, we didn't want O.J.'s life to end with a bullet in his head? 
</P>
<P>
 And, finally, wasn't there that great rush of exhilaration when we knew O.J. 
wouldn't die on Friday? Why was that? Doesn't it translate to our deeply held 
feelings about the redemptive possibilities of life? 
</P>
<P>
 If you shared those feelings about O.J., how would you feel about the State of 
California executing him? If the polls are correct, many people who cheered 
O.J.'s safety on Friday support executions. Were they rooting for a nonviolent 
end to Friday's insanity just so O.J. Simpson could go to trial and, if found 
guilty, be executed? 
</P>
<P>
 I know I'm getting ahead of myself. Prosecutors haven't said whether they'd 
seek the death penalty. Furthermore, Simpson hasn't entered a plea, been tried 
or convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 But I'm not stretching that far. Prosecutors have said the case at least 
qualifies for death-penalty consideration. If they believe their case is 
strong, we must consider the possibility that Simpson could be convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Would you vote to send O.J. Simpson to the gas chamber? Can you picture him in 
the chair? 
</P>
<P>
 If not, why not? If you support it for anonymous men in Florida or Arkansas or 
Georgia or California, why not for O.J. too? 
</P>
<P>
 If the charges are true, he would be a double killer who apparently was trying 
to get away with his crime. How can you describe the crimes as anything but 
heinous, especially considering his children are left without their mother? How 
can anyone not be sickened by imagining the deaths of the former Mrs. Simpson 
and Goldman? 
</P>
<P>
 All the ingredients would be there. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 And yet does that square with what you were thinking as you watched the events 
Friday? Did you want him brought in alive so he could get his just deserts in 
the gas chamber, or were you hoping that he wouldn't kill himself so he could 
salvage something of himself, even if it meant being behind bars for the rest 
of his life? 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe this is too heavy for a Friday night that has now passed midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 I hope it's clear this isn't a column about O.J. Simpson's guilt or innocence. 
It's a column about how you and I feel -- really feel -- about the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe I'm all wrong, but I didn't sense any bloodlust for O.J.'s hide during 
this long, long Friday. I sensed a public sorrow for two young people who died, 
and a different kind of sorrow for O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't sense a public that -- at least on that day and for that man -- 
favors the death penalty as much as it says it does. 
</P>
<P>
 When all was said and done, and when Friday had ended with no one else dead, I 
sensed a relieved public that favored life over death for someone who may have 
killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Parsons' column appears Wednesday, Friday and Sunday.

CRISIS-CARE CENTER FOR CHILDREN HAILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a decade of planning and a massive $10-million fund-raising drive, Casa 
Pacifica opened its doors to the public Saturday, revealing a network of 
bright, airy cottages designed to ease the anxiety of Ventura County's 
foster-care children. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the crisis center won't begin taking abused and neglected youths 
until July 18, a cadre of elected officials and project supporters wandered 
through the 22-acre Camarillo campus for a midday dedication ceremony and tour 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "What you see today is the physical evidence of a dream come true," Richard H. 
Goodrich, president of the center's board of directors, told the audience of 
about 200. "'What you see before you is a new hope for the children of Ventura 
County." 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the facility began last fall, but the project has been in the 
planning stages for much longer. Elected officials and local business people 
combined forces to found the center and have committed to a joint effort to 
keep it running. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times in the early morning hours when I wondered how to do it, but 
I never doubted we could do it," said Supervisor Susan K. Lacey, who has been 
involved in the project since its inception. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandwiched between rows of Camarillo citrus orchards and farmlands, the campus 
redwood barn-style buildings and vast green lawns are meant to communicate a 
feeling of freedom and comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal envisioned by Casa Pacifica's planners was to create a safe haven for 
troubled children, while easing the burden on Ventura County's crisis-care 
system. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, abused children are taken from their families and placed in foster homes. 
From there, they are shuttled to hospitals, counselors or sometimes the police. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Pacifica is designed to change that process. The campus is set up as both 
an emergency shelter for children and a residential home for older youths who 
have exhausted the foster-care system. 
</P>
<P>
 The system is designed to reduce children's stress by bringing social workers, 
police and counselors to them. The children will leave only for court 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very exciting," said Judy Adams, a social worker with the county's 
children's protective services agency. "Once we put the kids here, we know 
they're going to stay here." 
</P>
<P>
 Meandering through the new buildings, Adams talked about the frustrations 
she's had over the past eight years wrestling with the county's existing 
foster-care system. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had to split up kids or place them (in a home) in the middle of the 
night," she said. "This is going to relieve those anxieties. We can focus more 
on the children because we know there's a place." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Adams said the recent incident in which a 6-year-old boy accidentally shot his 
3-year-old brother while playing with a shotgun was a classic example of how a 
facility such as Casa Pacifica would have helped ease a problematic crisis-care 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-year-old and three siblings were taken into custody by protective 
services after Wednesday's shooting. The 3-year-old remains in stable condition 
at Ventura County Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The county managed to keep the siblings together, but they had to be moved 
from one foster home to another. Casa Pacifica would allow the children to stay 
put, Adams said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'Thank God for Casa Pacifica because we won't have to do this 
anymore,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Casa Pacifica administrators have strived to make their campus as warm and 
welcoming as possible for the temporary and long-term children who will be 
staying there. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bedrooms in the four cottages are Spartan -- containing only a bed, 
desk and closet -- they are adjacent to a spacious central living room 
decorated with colorful posters and beanbag chairs.  
</P>
<P>
 With 85 beds, Casa Pacifica will house about 60 children and 25 babies and 
toddlers at any given time. Administrators expect to care for more than 500 
youngsters each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive Director Steven E. Elson said he expects eight children, four girls 
and four boys to arrive July 18. By August, he said, Casa Pacifica should be 
housing about 24 youths. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In his speech during the dedication ceremony, Elson said Casa Pacifica would 
be a place where children's disturbing stories would be told, and new, happier 
tales born. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will hear the stories of 500 children each year," Elson said. "The story 
of 10-year-old Maria who has been raped by her cousin . . . the story of Sara, 
a 4-year-old who has been beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 "And as they tell their stories, our task is going to be to add a different 
chapter," he said.

COUNTY PLAN FOR CLEAN AIR WILL NOT PASS EPA'S TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA M. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Planners in charge of cleaning up the county's air are working furiously to 
finish a pollution reduction plan, but even as they write they know that 
federal authorities will reject the plan and impose sanctions to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other areas of the state with air pollution problems, Ventura County must 
write a plan and develop regulations that prove the county can reduce air 
pollution enough to meet health standards by 2005, or face sanctions by the U. 
S. Environmental Protection Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 By Nov. 15, the EPA must have the document, known as the air quality 
management plan, which must already have been approved by Ventura County and 
state authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 But the document county planners hope to complete by the end of the month will 
not contain enough tough new regulations to meet the clean air mandate, said 
Scott Johnson, planning manager for the Ventura County Air Pollution Control 
District. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the exercise of writing a plan that essentially fails to meet its 
goals has been frustrating for the staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough to be pushing papers instead of reducing emissions," he said. "But 
the plan will succeed in the sense that it will improve air quality in Ventura 
County to some extent, so there is benefit from that." 
</P>
<P>
 To further complicate the equation, the EPA has circulated a draft of a tough 
pollution reduction plan that has drawn criticism from business and industry 
locally and throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 That plan contains enough measures for the district to meet its clean air 
goals, Johnson said. But those measures cannot be used by local districts until 
the federal plan is adopted in February, three months after the district's plan 
is due before the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal plan contains regulations on such pollution-causing activities as 
interstate trucking, locomotives and shipping at sea. The local district has no 
jurisdiction over those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We're really in a box," Johnson said. "EPA will slap sanctions on us if we 
don't submit a plan to them by Nov. 14. But we're not going to be able to make 
up the gap (in pollution reduction) without the things identified in the 
federal implementation plan." 
</P>
<P>
 Sanctions could include stiff new requirements for further emission reductions 
as well as the withholding of federal transportation dollars, which amount to 
millions for the county each year. 
</P>
<P>
 But because there is an 18-month grace period between the time the sanctions 
are imposed and the day they are implemented, Johnson said the county should be 
able to revise its plan to include the federal measures in time to avoid losing 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil Levine, an attorney with the Environmental Defense Center in Santa 
Barbara, said the district is understandably avoiding responsibility and opting 
instead to let the federal government take the heat for the kinds of controls 
needed to clean up the county's air. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways, it would be political suicide," he said. "The Air Pollution 
Control District does not have the strength to regulate some of the industries 
that are the economic base for the county." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the district plan and the federal plan both have run into 
opposition from the agriculture industry, which could face new controls on 
emissions from heavy farm equipment, as well as controls on pesticide emissions 
and interstate truckers that pick up produce in the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the agriculture industry, it's easier for the district to point its 
finger at the EPA and say, 'It's the federal government that's coming down on 
you, not us,' " Levine said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Another very unpopular measure, which the district could adopt but does not 
intend to include in its plan, is the so-called emissions cap. 
</P>
<P>
 That provision, which was proposed by the EPA, would require large pollution 
producers to reduce emissions by more than 4% per year for five years beginning 
in 2001. The reductions are based on emission levels in 1990, but if the 
businesses were required to reduce emissions for other reasons since then, they 
still must reduce another 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 The provision amounts to a double hit, said Marc Charney, president of the 
Ventura County Economic Development Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cap essentially says you take a snapshot of a business in 1990 and reduce 
emissions from there by 25% by 2005," he said. "But there is no credit given 
for emission reductions after 1990." 
</P>
<P>
 Charney's group strongly opposes the emissions cap and is developing control 
measures that he says will be offered as substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to come up with something that is both technically feasible and 
socially acceptable," he said. The economic development association's 
alternative proposals to the EPA's plan should be complete by the end of the 
week, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Charney, a local attorney, acknowledged that the EPA draft plan was not 
intended to be punitive on local businesses. But that would be the effect if 
many of its provisions are adopted, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think everyone realizes that what the federal implementation plan proposes 
is unrealistic in a lot of places and unworkable -- it's an administrative 
nightmare." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The EPA was ordered to prepare the federal implementation plan after the U.S. 
Supreme Court ended a five-year struggle between the federal government and 
local environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 After the EPA approved Ventura County's 1982 air quality management plan that 
also failed to show that the county would reach clean air goals, the Citizens 
to Preserve the Ojai sued the EPA. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1988 settlement produced a court order for the EPA to write a plan to clean 
up the air. But after the federal Clean Air Act was revised in 1990, the EPA 
claimed that the lawsuit was moot and that it no longer was responsible for 
writing a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 A lower court agreed with the EPA, but the decision was overturned on appeal. 
In 1993, the EPA appealed that decision to the U.S. Supreme Court, which 
declined to hear the case and let stand the ruling that the EPA had to write a 
plan to clean up air in Ventura County, and the Los Angeles and Sacramento 
areas as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Green, president of the Citizens to Preserve the Ojai, said diminished 
lung capacity and other health problems associated with smog are compelling 
reasons to embrace the measures in the federal plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "There always is a cry that (controlling air pollution) is a big expense," he 
said. "But there is a bigger expense for our children and grandchildren 
attached if we wait. We need to bite the bullet now and work together."

 The first substantial brush fires of the 1994 fire season began within three 
minutes of one another Saturday, as Ventura County firefighters stretched 
resources to extinguish the east county blazes. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters fought a 30-acre fire near the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library 
and a 10-acre blaze on the east side of the Conejo Grade in Newbury Park for 
about four hours before the fires were contained late Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said an arsonist sparked the smaller fire, which was at the end 
of Old Conejo Road about a mile from a mobile home park. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the larger blaze, in an unincorporated part of the county near 
Tierra Rejada and Madera roads, was unknown, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tierra Rejada Road was closed between Madera Road and the Moorpark Freeway for 
about an hour Saturday as five engines and three hand crews attempted to gain 
control of the blaze, sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said they faced a tough logistical situation for the first 
serious fires of the season. Crews were dispatched to the Newbury Park blaze at 
1:40 p.m. and to the Tierra Rejada fire at 1:43. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very hectic afternoon," said Vicki Crabtree, a Fire Department 
dispatcher. "We had to utilize the majority of our equipment and then call in 
other agencies to assist us." 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 county firefighters came out to battle the two blazes, and crews 
from Oxnard, Point Mugu and Ventura crossed the Conejo Grade to cover for the 
overtaxed county stations.  
</P>
<P>
 One firefighter said the intensity of Saturday's blazes made him feel as 
though it was already August. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really dry out there and the grass burned real clean," said Ron Lauer, 
a fire engineer from Ventura County Station 45, the first to respond to the 
Tierra Rejada incident. "It didn't feel like the first fire of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Forecasters at the National Weather Service said the dry weather Saturday was 
likely to continue for the next several days. The high temperature in the 
Thousand Oaks area Saturday was 78 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newbury Park blaze sent smoke billowing across the Ventura Freeway for 
several hours Saturday. On Old Conejo Road, residents gathered to watch as a 
helicopter dropped water on hot spots that burned in patches on the hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was close," said Sue Anderson, 70, who could see the flames from her Old 
Conejo Road home. "I would venture to say they had 30 trucks up here." 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson has lived in Newbury Park since 1952 and has seen numerous fires burn 
through the hilly areas surrounding her neighborhood, including last fall's 
Green Meadow fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen a lot of fires," Anderson said. "One a scale of 1 to 10, 
(Saturday's) was about a 4." 
</P>
<P>
 Fire officials said the Tierra Rejada fire briefly posed a threat to several 
nearby structures. Firefighters responding to that blaze said their initial 
fear was that it was heading straight for the Presidential Library. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about that as we were heading out there," Lauer said. "It looked a 
lot like it would make a run for the library, which would have been rough. But 
by the time we got there it became clear that it was heading in a different 
direction." 
</P>
<P>
 The fire did come within a mile of the library and half a mile of a nearby 
ranch, but fire officials said proper brush clearance and a quick response 
prevented any structures from being damaged.

PLAN URGED TO CUT YOUTHS' CRIME CYCLE; JUVENILE JUSTICE: SOCIAL SERVICE 
OFFICIALS WILL ASK THE BOARD OF SUPERVISORS TO INVEST IN A BROAD, AMBITIOUS 
POST-RELEASE COUNSELING PROGRAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Busted again, Arturo and Eddie are back inside Ventura County's Colston Youth 
Center, locked up for committing gang crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Arturo says he ripped off car stereos, while Eddie admits smashing windows to 
intimidate a witness in his brother's murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Valerie and Roger are back inside Colston too, unable to stay off drugs and 
out of trouble that violated their probation, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 The four teen-agers -- here identified only by first names because of their 
age -- say they want to go straight, get jobs and stay free. 
</P>
<P>
 But the little guidance they get from adults in the Ventura County juvenile 
justice system is no match for the temptation of drink, drugs and crime, they 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I'm out, when I'm drunk or under the influence, I want to do 
crimes," said Arturo, a slight 17-year-old who claims membership in Oxnard's La 
Colonia gang. 
</P>
<P>
 "You say you're going to do good now because you're in here, but when you get 
back out, it's the real world." 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County social service officials are working on a plan to break this 
pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, officials plan to ask the Board of Supervisors to invest in a 
broad, ambitious post-release counseling program meant to keep young 
lawbreakers from committing crimes again. 
</P>
<P>
 Now guided only by weekly visits from probation officers and biweekly 
counseling sessions, some teen-agers just keep committing crimes, getting 
arrested and cycling through county juvenile facilities, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once they get out of Colston, they're slipping and in some cases falling and 
reoffending -- quite often within 120 days," said Frank Woodson, director of 
probation for Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we want to do is focus on the needs of kids and their families as 
they're released from the facilities." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most young scofflaws toe the line after getting slapped with probation, 
community service or time at Colston, said Calvin Remington, Woodson's court 
division manager at the county Corrections Services Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 But of about 2,000 youths the agency incarcerates each year, "There are 
somewhere around 8% who are habitual offenders and create a disproportionate 
amount of all crime," Remington said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The real hope . . . is to be able to identify those kids early, before 
they're in and out of our institutions," he said. "If we can do more with them 
at 12 years of age, maybe we'll do less with them further down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, still in the planning stages, is meant to surround young 
offenders on all sides -- at school, at home and on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the plan believe that if they can keep these teen-agers out of 
trouble for six months, they will continue to behave and eventually find work 
and a place in society, said Randall Feltman, the county's director of mental 
health.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But the officials are under no delusions about what the program can achieve, 
Feltman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not going to close Juvenile Hall and Colston," he said. "But if we can 
reduce the rate of recidivism for those 300 kids, we've concentrated on the 
most high-risk-to-arrest kids in the county, and if we get that (rate) down to 
20%, that'd be a substantial change in the frequency of crime for the 
community." 
</P>
<P>
 Social workers in the program would draw up a risk profile for each youth, 
then lay out a treatment plan sealed by a court-enforced contract with the 
youth and his or her family, Woodson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Youths still would get counseling from social workers and legal guidance from 
their probation officers as they do now. 
</P>
<P>
 But in addition, counselors could push them and their parents to try to sort 
out family problems that may be aggravating their delinquency, said Don 
Kingdon, director of family services for the county Department of Mental 
Health. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The department also might work with the county Department of Education to put 
day treatment programs at schools, where the youths could go for counseling 
after classes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most young offenders -- an estimated 80% -- also drink or use drugs, 
compounding their problems, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 These would be required to meet with drug and alcohol treatment counselors and 
perhaps attend meetings of Alcoholics Anonymous or Narcotics Anonymous, they 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the kid is having present problems with alcohol and drugs, the likelihood 
that they're going to be doing any type of counseling is going to be absolutely 
nil," said Stephen Kaplan, director of substance abuse programs for the county 
Health Care Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're using, you're not there (mentally)," Kaplan said. "You have to work 
with the kids to get them sober and clear their thinking and get them grounded 
in what's going on. Once you've done that -- and it's obviously more easily 
said than done -- you can look at the other issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Youths in the program will still be tested at random for drug and alcohol use 
-- as they are now -- in a bid to enforce their sobriety, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 16- to 18-year-olds who have dropped out or been expelled from school may 
also get vocational training to learn auto repair, welding or other skills that 
could lead to jobs, Woodson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the program faces a hefty roadblock: Funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The county received $1 million in Social Security Act grants in the past year 
for youth programs, but it is also facing one of its harshest budget scenarios 
yet, Woodson said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Already facing a $16-million budget deficit, the Board of Supervisors may have 
to slash its health care programs if the Legislature approves Gov. Pete 
Wilson's latest spending plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodson said he wants the board to put the grant money into a trust fund to 
feed the program, which ultimately could save the county money if it succeeds 
in cutting the juvenile recidivism rate. 
</P>
<P>
 Money also could be saved if young offenders can be kept together with 
families rather than be put into out-of-county placement homes that cost 
Ventura County $3,500 monthly or more per youth, said Kingdon. 
</P>
<P>
 Also in question, however, is how well any of this will work. 
</P>
<P>
 Colston was designed to treat teen-age offenders for emotional or substance 
abuse problems, but "now it has more to do with kids who are just much more 
criminally inclined," Deputy Dist. Atty. John Cardoza said. "There are some 
kids who are much more predisposed to being treated, and some who are more 
resistant." 
</P>
<P>
 "But if there's anything helpful, you've got to make that effort," added 
Cardoza, who oversees juvenile cases for the district attorney's office. "There 
are some kids who it'd surprise me that anything would help. There are some in 
whom the ingrained behavior has been going on for such a long period of time, 
but you're pretty sanguine about miracles occurring. You just can't know until 
things are implemented." 
</P>
<P>
 Without intensive guidance such as this, many newly freed juvenile offenders 
will keep going back to old friends and old ways, said Juvenile Court Judge 
Steven Z. Perren, who is also working on the program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't expect to bring a kid from an environment like that, treat him on 
the short term and then return him to the environment again and expect better 
behavior out of him," Perren said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hope is that with cooperative efforts between all the case managers, the 
courts, the drugs and alcohol program, the county services providers and the 
public that we can reduce these behaviors." 
</P>
<P>
 Any treatment increase will help, said Kim Sheen, a senior deputy probation 
officer at Colston. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes sense in the long run," she said last week. "We're wasting a lot of 
money when we try to plug the holes. The kids go home and we react to their 
negative behavior instead of reinforcing the positives." 
</P>
<P>
 Eddie, 17, says he will need all the help he can get to stay away from booze 
and gang crimes when he gets out Sept. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Last time he got out, he violated probation by drinking and hanging out with 
his Fillmore gang just days after his counseling ended, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, he wants to find a job and stay straight. He knows if he is 
arrested again as an adult, he will go to jail. 
</P>
<P>
 And Valerie, 17, says that sitting in Narcotics Anonymous meetings and 
listening to others' tales of drug use only makes her want to use more. 
</P>
<P>
 Only intensive drug counseling will keep her off rock cocaine when she gets 
out, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's encouraging -- they have all these plans for you when you get out," 
Valerie said. Then she added, "I don't think I'll use rock anymore, but I don't 
know about the other stuff."

<P>
 A party held by a Thousand Oaks teen-ager ended in violence early Saturday 
when 15 gang members broke windows, brandished a gun and beat up a party-goer, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 150 teen-agers, including two known gang members, were at a party on 
Westbury Court in Thousand Oaks when 15 people claiming to be from a rival gang 
began breaking the windows, Ventura County sheriff's officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 When one of the party-goers, an 18-year-old youth from Thousand Oaks, went 
outside, an alleged gang member pulled a gun, sheriff's officials said. The 
gang member then struck the 18-year-old in the chin with the gun handle and 
left the scene, officials said. The victim was not hospitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said they have not made any arrests in the case, but it is 
under investigation. MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; STING CITES CLERKS WHO SELL ALCOHOL TO MINORS

<P>
 A Ventura County Sheriff's Department sting operation timed to coincide with 
high school graduation parties caught 14 store employees in the act of selling 
alcohol to minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's cadets ages 18 and 19 visited about 60 businesses in Moorpark, 
Thousand Oaks and Newbury Park on Friday night and asked to purchase alcoholic 
beverages.  
</P>
<P>
 At 14 of the stores, the sales clerks complied. They were cited and released 
at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials called the sting an effective means of combatting the 
problems associated with young people drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The program was scheduled to occur during graduation because of the numerous 
end-of-the-year parties being held in the east part of the county, officials 
said. MATTHEW MOSK

 Deputy Secretary of Commerce David Barram will meet with Ojai Valley residents 
at 6:30 p.m. Monday at Matilija Junior High School to discuss the National 
Weather Service's radar tower on Sulphur Mountain. 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents of the weather tracking system want the federal government to move 
the tower. Some residents fear the radar could pose health risks, although a 
federal judge has ruled that adequate safety studies have been conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 Barram will meet with Ojai and Ventura County officials before Monday night's

FLETCHER JONES, CAR DEALER, DIES AT 76 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fletcher Jones, a colorful car dealer who built a chain of agencies from a 
single Los Angeles lot, died Thursday in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 He was 76.At the time of his death from what his family described as natural 
causes, Jones had amassed an organization of 11 domestic- and foreign-car 
dealerships in California and Nevada -- a long way from selling his first 
automobile for $70. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, Jones purchased a bankrupt Mercedes-Benz dealership in Newport Beach 
and asked his son, Fletcher (Ted) Jones Jr. to run it. Called Fletcher Jones 
Motor Cars in Newport Beach, the dealership is now the second largest Mercedes 
dealer in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 His son is married to Las Vegas Mayor Jan Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 From his start at a Chrysler-Plymouth dealership in Los Angeles in 1950, the 
elder Jones' business grew rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 He became omnipresent in the early days of television advertising, smiling and 
cuddling puppies and kittens on camera and offering to send a portion of his 
auto sales profits to animal shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones opened his first Nevada dealership in Las Vegas in 1966. In 1992, Auto 
Age 500 reported his dealerships as the 12th largest group in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 He attended USC on a basketball scholarship and opened his first car lot with 
only $1,200 in capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Survivors include his sons Fletcher Jr. and Robert; daughters Stephanie and 
Bonnie, and 10 grandchildren.

<P>
 Police in Reno had been searching house to house for Mailin Thao Stafford 
since her mother reported her missing at 4:30 p.m. Thursday, officials there 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Reno Police Lt. Nick Bloomster said that after the first day, 
investigators began to suspect that the girl's family members were involved in 
the disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't report her missing until a full day after she was gone," he said. 
"And there had apparently been a history of child abuse in the family." 
</P>
<P>
 Police initially suspected that Mailin's grandparents might be involved in her 
disappearance because they had been fighting with the girl's mother for custody 
of the 3-year-old, Bloomster said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, however, they focused their attention on Mailin's stepfather, 
Carlos Perez Gutierrez. After a lengthy interview, Gutierrez admitted that he 
had beaten Mailin and that the girl died after a beating on Wednesday, Reno 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Gutierrez and the girl's mother, Tara Ray Gutierrez, drove 
Mailin's body to Grimes Canyon Road near Fillmore and threw it down a steep 
hillside. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies said they joined Reno police in a search of 
the area Saturday and found the body about 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors told the Reno Gazette-Journal that Mailin "seemed to be a nice, 
quiet girl." 
</P>
<P>
 "She'd be looking out the window every time we came home from work and she 
would say 'hi' to us," one neighbor said. "But I never saw her outside being 
rowdy or loud. She seemed to stay home for the most part." 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy is scheduled to be performed this morning by a Ventura County 
coroner, officials said.

EX-PATIENT HELPS LIFT THE SPIRITS OF OTHERS; RECOVERY: STEVEN DIMMICK SPENDS UP 
TO FOUR DAYS A WEEK ON THE THIRD FLOOR AT THE HOSPITAL IN HAWTHORNE. THE STAFF 
LAUDS HIS EFFORTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN PATERNO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Steven Dimmick burned his little toe on a campfire a few years ago, he 
never thought that it would lead to gangrene, a partial amputation of his foot, 
impaired eyesight and five months in the hospital. But as much as he lost in 
the experience, Dimmick found something too: humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 During his 1992 stay at Robert F. Kennedy Medical Center in Hawthorne, he 
spent a good deal of time helping other patients cope with depression. Dimmick, 
29, is still on the road to recovery, but he continues to spend three and four 
days a week on the hospital's third floor, helping lift the spirits of those 
who need it. 
</P>
<P>
 Dimmick says he helps himself feel better by helping others. He gets the guy 
in traction a banana that the nurses don't have time to fetch. He plays cards. 
He talks. He offers suggestions -- based on his own experiences -- on how to 
cope with the long hospital days and nights. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve is wonderful," said Julia Johnson, director of activities for the 
hospital recreational therapy program on the third floor. "He's so loving, 
warmhearted and caring. He gives a lot of himself to patients and to the staff. 
He's always there to assist us." 
</P>
<P>
 She said the other patients feel comfortable with him. "They feel his 
kindness. He gives them a little extra tender loving care, a little extra time. 
That makes them feel good about themselves. Just being there to share with the 
other patients and letting them know, 'Hey, you're not alone. I've been going 
through it for years.' That's a good feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Dimmick, who lives in Gardena, calls the hospital his "home away from home." 
His eyes fill with tears when he remembers the day he was discharged. "That 
staff did so much for me," he said. "I wanted to return the favor." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospitals were the furthest thing from his mind in December, 1991, when he 
burned his toe. He and his friends were sitting around the campfire, drinking 
and talking, when he casually moved a metal lawn chair with his bare foot. He 
didn't realize that the chair had been close to the fire and that the metal was 
hot enough to burn his skin. 
</P>
<P>
 A diabetic since age 11, Dimmick knew how important it was to make sure that 
the wound healed. Because of blood sugar imbalances, diabetics are much more 
susceptible to chronic infection and eventual gangrene than are non-diabetics, 
he said. "But I wasn't too worried," he said, because he had previously had 
numerous scrapes, burns and blisters without problems. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, the blister was nearly gone. Then Dimmick got the flu. For 
five days, he lay in bed, not even feeling well enough to take off his socks. 
When he did, he was horror-stricken: Nearly half of his left foot was black. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping my brother had played a practical joke on me," he said. "I 
yelled at him, 'Please tell me you painted my foot black, please tell me!' But 
he said he hadn't. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought this could happen to me, especially from a little blister." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite more than a dozen surgeries, Dimmick lost only a small part of his 
foot. And although his eyesight was damaged because of a complication of the 
diabetes, he has regained most of his sight. He is learning to walk again and 
hopes to go back someday to his job as a union carpenter. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had to do it all over again, I'd probably become a doctor," he said. "In 
my work, I can finish building something and say, 'I built that,' and it's a 
neat feeling. But it's not the same as seeing people feel better or look 
better. I get more satisfaction from seeing people laugh."

OPEN ENROLLMENT RESUSCITATES LAUSD; PULSE IS STRONGEST IN WEST VALLEY, AND 
DISTRICT OFFICIALS SHOULD TRY TO FIND OUT WHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Well, the patient has a pulse. That's good news, the kind that ought to be 
spread far and wide. Oddly enough, however, this patient appears to be 
decidedly uncertain about whether to be happy about it, and about whether this 
little burst of good health should even be analyzed. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 The patient that has nearly been declared deceased on several occasions is the 
ailing Los Angeles Unified School District. The pulse -- quite a strong one in 
fact -- was found in the west San Fernando Valley, of all places. There, this 
past week, parents were actually thrilled to hear that their children had 
gotten spaces inside certain LAUSD schools. Other parents were dismayed, even 
depressed, to hear that their children had been turned away. 
</P>
<P>
 The occasion involved lotteries held at schools such as Sherman Oaks 
Elementary and other campuses. These schools had received so much interest from 
parents participating in the district's fledgling choice/open enrollment 
program that they had to conduct drawings for the limited number of slots 
available. One of the happiest moms was Brenda Skelly, depicted here, whose son 
will attend Sherman Oaks Elementary. 
</P>
<P>
 The flood of interest in the campuses with the best reputations is what public 
school choice is all about. Yet it was completely unexpected in a district as 
oft-maligned as the LAUSD. Some parents, who earlier had placed their children 
in private schools, even came flocking back to the much-maligned LAUSD. 
</P>
<P>
 But is the LAUSD keeping track of these numbers? Well, no. It ought to do 
that, and more, such as taking a close look at the schools that parents and 
students wanted to leave behind. That could help identify problem campuses as 
well as give the district some much-needed material to boast about. There is 
much to learn here, and the district officials are a bit too slow out of the 
blocks in terms of analyzing it.

THEY COULDN'T HIT THE SIDE OF A BARN; ROBERTI SHOT DOWN THE GUN LOBBY, AND THE 
REST IS LITTLE MORE THAN CONVERSATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the aftermath of the recent election, far too much has been made of the 
so-called stinging defeat of Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) in the race for 
state treasurer. Devastating, some pundits said. Evidence, others said, of how 
badly the gun lobby had wounded the senator in its failed attempt to oust him 
from office a few months early because of his avid support of gun control. The 
recall attempt against Roberti in April "killed his ability to raise money," 
claimed one of its leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Roberti seemed to succumb to the mood of the moment when he said, "When 
the gun lobby goes after you, it does have an adverse impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Begging the senator's pardon, but let's get real here, folks. 
</P>
<P>
 Some small measure of this might have been true had there been any evidence 
that Roberti had long harbored an avid interest in the treasurer post. He did 
not. In fact, because term limits were going to bring his long Senate career to 
an end in December, Roberti had decided to retire from political life, period. 
That account came from the senator and his wife in a story by Times reporter 
Cynthia Craft in April. That story needs to be recalled now, pun intended. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the gun lobby that had long hated Roberti for his successful ban on 
certain military-style assault weapons had only to wait quietly until December 
to be rid of him. Instead, they so angered him with that costly, silly and 
untimely recall effort that he perhaps overreacted by seeking a statewide 
office he would not otherwise have coveted so suddenly. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun lobby did not grievously wound Roberti. In fact, the senator kicked it 
firmly in the seat of its pants, turning the recall back by a hefty 59% to 41% 
margin. The campaign against him was peopled by weak candidates who were either 
part of the gun lobby or kowtowed to it. The biggest vote-getter among them did 
not even take part in the first real race for Roberti's 20th Senate District 
seat, the June 7 primary. 
</P>
<P>
 The unimpressive support garnered by the other Roberti opponents in the recall 
election was equaled in the Republican primary race for the Senate seat. And 
the winner among them, Dolores White with 9,975 votes, figures to be thrashed 
come November by the venerable Herschel Rosenthal, who pulled in 26,378 votes 
in the Democratic primary. We might add here that Rosenthal is a supporter of 
gun control and was a supporter of Roberti's ban against assault weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 If there was a race that was more important for Roberti to win, it was 
certainly the recall election and not the race for treasurer. It exposed an 
important weakness in the saber-rattling gun lobby. Let's remember David 
Roberti for that.

END-TO-END SYSTEMS ENGINEERING NEEDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I have just finished reading Kenneth R. Janowski's article "State Taking 
Wrong Road in Drive for Electronic Vehicles" (Commentary, June 12). I am 
overjoyed to see him point out that generating the electricity to charge the 
batteries causes pollution, and that this must be counted against the electric 
cars.These cars are not pollution-free.  
</P>
<P>
 This is what we engineers call end-to-end systems engineering, a way of 
saying, "Look at the whole picture." It's too bad that politicians and their 
staffs seem unable to take this approach. We might be a lot better off. 
</P>
<P>
 Crime, welfare, health care, drugs, etc., are all amenable to this kind of 
analysis. But as Lester Thurow pointed out in his book, "The Zero Sum Game," we 
have government by special interest groups, precluding any rational approach to 
solving the problems that plague our cities, counties, states and nation. Thus 
we have electric cars, which do not create less pollution but only move it 
someplace else.

HOW MANY GUNS ARE ENOUGH?; WE HAVE 210 MILLION, BUT SECURITY IS AS ELUSIVE AS 
EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees, but many people still seem to think that the best way to 
fight crime is to be prepared for it -- by owning a gun. It's a pretty silly 
concept when you consider the odds. It is as if members of this fully armed 
citizenry expect to be alert and prepared, with the weapon right at hand at the 
moment of truth. 
</P>
<P>
 That's ridiculous, and here is a case in point. Consider the retired judge who 
dutifully loaded his pump shotgun and his .357 magnum revolver and left them at 
his bedside every night. One can safely assume that he felt fully prepared to 
defend hearth and home against criminals on the prowl. So what happens? Our 
former judge subsequently slept soundly through a nearby magnitude 4 
earthquake. That's readiness for you. 
</P>
<P>
 The home of this same alert citizen, by the way, had been burglarized 
repeatedly. The thieves escaped with more of the guns the ex-judge had bought 
to replace those that had already been stolen from him. You could say that the 
guns were an expensive mistake providing little more than a false sense of 
security. You could also say that he had exercised his Second Amendment right 
to inadvertently arm the neighborhood crooks to the teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 In truth, there has never been more evidence that crime and gun violence, 
while down overall in the San Fernando Valley and its environs, can strike 
anywhere, at any time. There is no place where you can be fully safe from it, 
and there is no way to be prepared for it. It's also never been more apparent 
that something must be done to try to reduce the incredible number of guns in 
circulation. Consider the following recent examples: 
</P>
<P>
 * Brothers from Van Nuys take a Russian friend, Armen Shakhkaramyan, on a 
fishing trip to Big Bear Lake. A gunman fires into their station wagon, killing 
the friend and wounding another vacation companion from North Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 * Security company telephone operator Jim Voshall of Chatsworth is carjacked 
and kidnaped at gunpoint. His assailants direct him on a frightening drive 
around the area. He escapes with his life by leaping from his moving car after 
his assailants allegedly tell him they are not going to kill him, "yet." 
</P>
<P>
 * A 22-year-old Panorama City mother is shot and killed after making a 
purchase at a convenience store. A bullet barely misses her baby. The suspect, 
a gang member, was apparently aiming at a rival gang, and missed. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 23-year-old Canoga Park man is shot and killed in Lake View Terrace; 
circumstances and motive unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 * A 60-year-old security guard from Lancaster, on duty outside a store, is 
wounded by gunfire and hospitalized. Two assailants remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
 These criminal acts were committed with some of the more than 210 million guns 
in circulation in America. The toll: three killed, two wounded and one who 
barely escaped death, all in four days of news touching residents of the Valley 
and its environs. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the easy availability of firearms that facilitates the violence and 
perpetuates such madness. What we ought to be willing to pay for is not more 
guns for ourselves, but for a larger police force, better trained and more 
suitably equipped with all manner of investigative tools, and perhaps better 
armed. But such incidents also speak to the need for more comprehensive and 
effective gun control, something that more than 50% of Americans now favor.

CITY HAS REASON TO BE PROUD OF RITCHIE VALENS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I heartily endorse changing the name of Paxton Park to Ritchie Valens Park. 
</P>
<P>
 More important than the fact that Ritchie Valenzuela was a rock star of 
international proportions is the reality that he was a positive role model, not 
only for his own generation of Latino youth but also today's generation. 
</P>
<P>
 I know this personally. I was Ritchie's record producer, and together we 
worked on releasing his hit recordings including "La Bamba," "Come On Let's Go" 
and "Donna." He possessed, at age 15, the grit, determination and persistence 
to make it in the very competitive world of music and recording. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulties back then, in the 1950s, were not merely musical or 
commercial. Barriers had been put in place by the mainly Anglo record business 
against Latin performers. The prevailing thought then was that they had no 
place in rock 'n' roll. Ritchie, happily, disproved this stereotypical line of 
thought, by his own talent, his recordings and, again, that determination to 
succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Pacoima has good reason to be proud of the late Ritchie Valens. A green park 
in the center of the city would be a fine tribute to the memory of Pacoima's 
rock 'n' roll son.

CAR-POOL LANES ENHANCE FREEWAYS' USEFULNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I am familiar with Gerald and Myrna Silver's constructive work toward 
aircraft noise reduction and thus the enhancement of Valley life. I was 
disappointed to see them take such a strong stand against high occupancy 
vehicle lanes (Commentary, June 5). 
</P>
<P>
 Although I am only a layman, I must differ with the Silvers on several of 
their claims. 
</P>
<P>
 First, they say that HOV lanes achieve the opposite of their intended purpose 
in that they don't take cars off the road. Right. Caltrans cannot reverse the 
population explosion. It can only attempt to be creative with its resources as 
the freeways inevitably grow wider and wider. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe its purpose in creating HOV lanes is to encourage fuller, more 
efficient use of a freeway by offering a voluntary incentive to those who share 
a car. Nobody has outlawed Silver's right to drive alone. Just let him drive 
with the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, they suggest that the public does not want to car-pool unless forced 
to by Big Brother. For at least five years, several of my co-workers have 
chosen to car-pool from Palmdale to Van Nuys about 80% of the time. They don't 
have a car-pool lane to enjoy. They didn't even have the corporate ride-sharing 
rebate until recently. They chose to car-pool out of common sense and 
economics. Perhaps voluntary incentives from Big Brother might open the eyes of 
others, no? 
</P>
<P>
 The Silvers find solo driving cheaper than public transit. I think a case 
could be made either way on that one. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, I am a technician, one of the service workers to whom they 
refer. I cover a territory of approximately 60 to 75 square miles, am quite 
productive and almost never use the freeway during my work. When I do sit stuck 
in traffic, it's usually because another solo driver is in front of me. 
</P>
<P>
 I must agree that the personal car is the most flexible transportation 
invented. Unfortunately, the Valley (and the world) has become too crowded to 
keep encouraging it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thinning out existing traffic may just encourage new traffic. Do Mr. and Mrs. 
Silver suggest that we limit traffic by eliminating HOV lanes and then freezing 
freeway expansion? Will the worsening traffic jams magically cause commuters to 
go elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
 I think not. No one can stop urban sprawl, and no one plans to outlaw drivers 
going solo. Caltrans has been experimenting with HOV lanes for 15 years and has 
learned how to run them pretty well. The same goes for metered freeway 
on-ramps. By providing the HOV incentive, they are just taking one proven step 
toward retaining our quality of life. 
</P>
<P>
 GREG GOLDEN 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys 
</P>
<P>
 * I agree with Gerald and Myrna Silver's arguments as to why constructing high 
occupancy vehicle lanes is a mistake. However, there are some glaring errors in 
their article, and I am not sure if I agree with their ultimate conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 In defending solo drivers, they state: "The last time we looked at the DMV 
Drivers Handbook, it was still legal to drive alone. Solo driving is a right 
and a benefit most people are willing to pay dearly for." 
</P>
<P>
 If they go back to the driver's handbook they will see that driving is not a 
right, it is a privilege. There is no constitutional protection of the "right 
to drive."  
</P>
<P>
 And would we pay dearly for the privilege? Maybe, but we don't now. We don't, 
contrary to the Silvers' contention, pay a steep fuel tax. The subsidy to the 
auto, after accounting for all fuel taxes, registration fees and tolls paid to 
all levels of government, is at least $300 billion per year.  
</P>
<P>
 Europeans, who covet their independence as much as we Americans, who engage in 
activities outside of the home as much if not more than we do, and who do pay 
steep fuel taxes, use their autos for half the percentage of trips U.S. 
citizens do. 
</P>
<P>
 While it will take considerably improved transit and land use that is not as 
hostile to the pedestrian, bicyclist and transit customer for people to feel 
they have alternatives to the auto, I believe that if the auto were less 
subsidized, people would choose to use other means for many trips. This is the 
way to reduce smog, sprawl and congestion.

 The Silvers, in defending the solo driver, imply that Caltrans should be 
building mixed flow lanes instead of HOV lanes. The problem is, all of the 
arguments they use against new HOV lanes apply to mixed flow lanes as well.

MOTEL OWNERS FORCED TO POLICE THE STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Your story "Motel Owners Split on Prostitution Issue" (June 8) missed the 
point by focusing on the "divided" motel owners. 
</P>
<P>
 I attended the meeting at the Carriage Inn, and I heard understandably 
frustrated and disheartened motel owners expressing legitimate arguments and 
complaints to the police and Councilman Marvin Braude's office about having 
been "ordered to check identification and hire security as part of 27 
conditions imposed by the Los Angeles City Zoning Department."These conditions 
have been imposed in a feeble, but (for the motel owners) very costly, attempt 
to alleviate prostitution in the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 I also heard about the new program which effectively allows the police to 
arrest prostitutes simply for being at the same location as they were when they 
were previously arrested -- making that job for the police a whole lot easier. 
You noted that now motel management can "call police to arrest these 
prostitutes simply for being on Sepulveda Boulevard." 
</P>
<P>
 I wonder why these motel owners (who are already busy enough trying to figure 
out how the heck they are going to comply with the city's conditions) should 
also be held accountable for seeing to it that prostitution does not occur 
along the public boulevard as well? Don't these motel owners have a right to 
complain when they are told they must "ease the problem of crime near their 
locations"? 
</P>
<P>
 As Albert Chiu, vice president of the Greater Los Angeles Hotel/Motel Assn. 
correctly pointed out, "Isn't this what we are all paying our taxes for?"

VALLEY COMMENTARY; IT'S THE NEIGHBORS' FAULT THAT QUAKE BOND FAILED; LOS 
ANGELES COUNTY'S COUNTERPARTS IN THE SOUTHLAND DEFEATED PROPOSITION 1A, WHICH 
WOULD HAVE HELPED THE VALLEY REPAIR DAMAGE. YET IF THERE WAS EVER A TIME 
CALIFORNIA NEEDS TO PULL TOGETHER, IT'S NOW. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAUL CLARKE, Paul Clarke of Northridge is a corporate political consultant. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the June 7 defeat of the state earthquake bond proposal, Proposition 1A, 
the city of Los Angeles lost more than $55 million in funds to help the San 
Fernando Valley repair some of its damage and to retrofit freeways and bridges. 
</P>
<P>
 The defeat was a surprise to many. A similar bond issue, Proposition 122, had 
passed statewide easily in June, 1990, following the 7.1 San Francisco 
earthquake. We also had a temporary half-cent sales tax increase then to cover 
those losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after the San Francisco quake, the Federal Emergency Management Agency 
estimated that an 8.3 earthquake in Los Angeles would cause $17 billion in 
damage. But a 6.8 quake here caused more than $20 billion in destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 I intended to begin this article by giving the Bay Area hell for taking our 
money to fix up after their earthquake and then refusing to pony up when it's 
our turn. I was going to note that they had voted down the proposition just two 
days before scientists said there is a 90% chance of a catastrophic quake in 
the Bay Area between now and 2020, while our chance of a similar disaster is 
estimated at only 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before I studied the voting returns. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco and Alameda counties supported the bonds by higher percentages 
than Los Angeles County. The other Bay Area counties -- Marin, Sonoma, San 
Mateo and Contra Costa -- were right behind Los Angeles in their percentage of 
"yes" votes. They were among the few counties in the state that gave 1A a 
winning margin. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I thought about giving the rest of Northern California hell for not 
caring about Southern California. Well, it's true that Lassen, Glenn and Tehama 
counties returned fewer than 20% "yes" votes for 1A. But Santa Cruz County had 
48% voting for it -- more than San Diego County. Yolo County had 40% voting for 
it -- more than San Bernardino County. 
</P>
<P>
 So, whom can we blame? Where did Proposition 1A really fall short? We have 
only to look in our own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange and San Bernardino counties had only 39% in favor; Ventura County, 42%; 
Santa Barbara and Riverside counties, 44%. 
</P>
<P>
 Can our neighbors be unaware that Southern California's earthquake threat 
affects them as well? I think not. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley in Ventura County suffered considerably from the Northridge quake. 
Anaheim in Orange County has applied for FEMA funds to put the "Big A" sign 
back on its stadium. Only two years have passed since the 7.5 Landers and the 
6.6 Big Bear quakes. Bakersfield and Long Beach have both had monster quakes 
this century. They all know our entire region is in danger. 
</P>
<P>
 I have to conclude our neighbors in the exurbs aren't singing "I Love L.A." 
They clearly seem to care about us and our current plight less than the folks 
in the Bay Area and other northern counties. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet if there was ever a time California needs to pull together, it's now. 
</P>
<P>
 The easy response to our neighbors' lack of support is to say, "OK, guys, just 
wait until you need money. We'll show you!" But to do so would make us more 
like Balkan countries than neighboring counties of the same state. We would be 
failing them as badly as they've failed us. 
</P>
<P>
 The responsible question to ask is, "Where do we go from here?" Although 
relief money is coming from various sources, the total appears to fall well 
short of what it will take to rebuild. The problem could be especially critical 
in places around the Valley that are suffering from a "ghost town" phenomenon 
because many owners of already devalued apartment houses desperately need 
government-backed loans to repair their inadequately insured buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature and the governor are going to have to bite the bullet -- soon. 
</P>
<P>
 The quickest solution would be for the Legislature to pass a temporary 
statewide sales tax increase similar to the one it enacted after the San 
Francisco quake. That's not an enticing prospect for an elected official, 
especially in an election year. 
</P>
<P>
 Just imagine what the folks at home are going to tell those legislators from 
counties in the far north where 1A got less than a third of the vote. Even 
Humboldt County, which had a 7.0 earthquake in 1992, gave it only 31% of the 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 There's still time for the Legislature to put a reworked bond issue on the 
November ballot. The earthquake bonds passed the Assembly 55-15 and the Senate 
27-11 on its way to the June ballot. But someone's going to have to campaign 
for it once it's there. Who's going to stand up in Orange or Ventura county and 
say, "We've got to have this"? No one running for reelection, that's for sure. 
</P>
<P>
 It's going to have to be sold to the voters by someone. Perhaps the 
construction industry, which would reap jobs from its passage, or local 
governments that will have to pick up the pieces if it isn't passed, can beat 
the drum. 
</P>
<P>
 This past week a media watchdog group complained that the primary election 
received only 0.04% of the available television news coverage in its sample 
period. Any television coverage of the propositions was just a small fraction 
of that. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 1A generated no controversy. It received only token opposition. If 
there is a renewed November effort for its passage, supporters may have to 
recruit opponents in order to stir up enough controversy to generate television 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Realistically, however, until our voting neighbors have a larger sense of 
"community" than they did on June 7, those of us in the Valley are going to 
dodge piles of rubble and gaze on boarded-up buildings for a long time to come.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; MANAGED CARE CAN CURE THE SYSTEM'S ILLS; BASHING THE POPULAR 
MODE OF MEDICINE FOR ITS COST CONSTRAINTS HAS BECOME FASHIONABLE. BUT IT 
PROVIDES OVERSIGHT, FREEDOM FOR DOCTORS AND HIGH-QUALITY, LIFE-SAVING SERVICES 
TO PATIENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEN MURRAY, Ken Murray, a family practitioner in Studio City, is medical 
director of the Lakeside Medical Group, a 300-physician group in the San 
Fernando Valley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Recently, there has been a lot of bashing of managed care, focusing on its 
efforts to control costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the criticism is not fair. While managed care does seek to control 
costs, there is much more to it than dollars and cents. As a physician, I am 
here to tell you that managed care saves lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In the medical group of which I am a member, a suggestion by a managed care 
company that we contract with helped us implement a system for tracking the 
results of mammograms. We noticed that at one hospital we worked with, tests 
were conducted improperly and results were difficult to read. We changed 
hospitals, paying more but making early detection of an unexpectedly large 
number of breast cancers. Early detection means a higher recovery rate. Two 
years after the change there have been no mistakes in diagnosis. 
</P>
<P>
 In my 10 years of practice as a private family practitioner, I have had 
considerable experience with managed care. Approximately 75% of my practice is 
currently made up of health maintenance organization patients. 
</P>
<P>
 I have witnessed a major evolution in how managed care companies approach 
health care. More competition among companies has led to more interest in 
quality and service. Quality care, in the long run, costs less. 
</P>
<P>
 How is quality judged under a fee-for-service system? No entity tracks the 
results of doctors' treatment plans.  
</P>
<P>
 Managed care provides this service. The managed care companies that I contract 
with track my performance and that of my colleagues. They review my patients' 
charts. They insist on documentation. 
</P>
<P>
 They function much as a business consultant. They do not interfere with my 
ability to make decisions for my patients. Rather, they provide advice that 
allows me to provide my patients with more assurance of quality care and 
service. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Committee for Quality Assurance, an independent nonprofit 
institution that reviews and accredits managed care organizations, and the 
development of Health Employee Data Information Service "report cards" for 
doctors are among the tools that the managed care industry is developing. 
</P>
<P>
 Managed care does not limit my decision-making ability as a doctor. It 
enhances it. I am a coordinator of care, ensuring that my patients receive the 
highest quality of service. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, I have become increasingly involved with managed care for 
several reasons. One reason is that under the fee-for-service system, 20% of 
Californians had no health care coverage. Care was unaffordable, and there was 
a severe lack of quality monitoring. 
</P>
<P>
 Managed care addresses these concerns and allows me to concentrate on 
providing the quality of care that I was trained to provide. Managed care 
focuses on preventive care and reducing unnecessary services. It seeks to lower 
costs, which means more access for more people. HMOs immunize children at twice 
the rate of indemnity plans, screen 2 1/2 times more women for breast cancer, 
provide annual physicals and routinely offer health education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Another reason for my increasing involvement with managed care is that more of 
my patients are choosing managed care health plans. Nearly 11 million 
Californians, 35% of the state's population, belong to HMOs. In a 1992 
nationwide survey of 90,000 consumers by the National Research Corp., a higher 
percentage of HMO participants said they were satisfied with their health plans 
than those with traditional plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Managed care is the future, a future filled with the promise of higher-quality 
care, lower costs and more access.

VALLEY COMMENTARY; GRADS STEP OUT FROM UNDER CLOUDY SKY; DESPITE TRAGEDIES AND 
PROBLEMS THAT HAVE FOLLOWED THEM THROUGH HIGH SCHOOL, EL CAMINO REAL SENIORS 
HELD THEIR HEADS HIGH. THEY'VE MADE IT THROUGH AN EXPERIMENT IN YEAR-ROUND 
CLASSES, THE DEATHS OF TWO CLASSMATES AND THE JAN. 17 EARTHQUAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARALYN SOIFER, Maralyn Soifer of West Hills, an educational therapist, has 
a daughter in the Class of 1994 at El Camino Real High School in Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It rained on El Camino Real High School's prom night. 
</P>
<P>
 That didn't dampen the spirits of one group of graduates of the Woodland Hills 
school posing in front of a limousine. As the parents eyed the darkening sky 
nervously, the girls pinned boutonnieres on their dates and checked their hair 
in the car mirrors. The boys grinned, fumbled with corsages and slapped one 
another on the back. Except for the showers, it was perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 But clouds have been following this class. The students have been at the mercy 
of arbitrary school board decisions, bureaucratic foul-ups and, literally, 
death and destruction. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as they began their high school careers, the Los Angeles Unified School 
District began an experiment in year-round schooling. The students were forced 
to cut short their summer, have eight weeks off in the middle of a two-semester 
course and miss weeks of preparation for the Scholastic Aptitude and advanced 
placement tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though they attended what some called a country club school, there was 
little air conditioning for those hot August days, and most students could not 
afford vacations to fancy resorts. Most of the time they sat home, watching 
soap operas, occasionally opening a book, trying to stay out of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, during the winter recess, two of their classmates were killed 
in accidents -- one in a car accident, the other in a flood. Many students 
attended the funerals. For most of them, it was the first experience with 
death, and they turned to one another to deal with their grief. 
</P>
<P>
 As the senior year approached, the school board voted to end the experiment 
with year-round schooling. The parents breathed a sigh of relief. College 
application deadlines were approaching. Letters of recommendation needed to be 
written. At last, the class of 1994 would have an uninterrupted school year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the worst was yet to come. Last summer, Judy Harrison, the El Camino Real 
college counselor, was reported missing. The private plane piloted by her 
husband never arrived at its destination. The students were devastated. Besides 
being a wonderful and knowledgeable college counselor, she was someone they 
could count on to help them with schedules, applications, recommendation 
letters and advice. 
</P>
<P>
 At school, registration was chaotic. Schedules were wrong. Lunch passes were 
delayed. Tempers were short. Somehow the students made it through those first 
few weeks. They persevered and pressured administrators to write letters to 
colleges explaining about their counselor. They found other teachers to write 
letters of recommendation. They took their problems to new and often overworked 
counselors who listened and helped them. 
</P>
<P>
 Then came Jan. 17. El Camino was heavily damaged in the Northridge earthquake. 
At first the students were thrilled. First semester finals were canceled, a 
senior's dream come true. But as the weeks dragged by and El Camino still 
didn't open, anxiety set in. Advanced placement study sessions were eventually 
scheduled in a few usable classrooms. Portable buildings were moved to the 
athletic fields. Finally, El Camino opened for the second semester, the last 
school in the district to reopen. 
</P>
<P>
 Normalcy seemed to be restored. The days were somewhat longer, and a one-day 
spring break went by in the blink of an eye. The students enthusiastically 
planned their grad night and prom. In reality, senior year, with its lumps and 
bumps, was a fitting culmination to the four years. 
</P>
<P>
 At graduation Thursday night, the portable buildings, still standing on the 
athletic fields, were a grim reminder of all that has happened. The students 
walked by with their heads high, cheered as a handful of classmates threw 
beachballs and toys in the air, and moved on with their lives.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; UNITED STATES HAS TO KISS ITS SWISSTER;

AREN'T HAPPY ABOUT FALL-BACK PERFORMANCE.

<P>
 Four years ago, childhood friends Tab Ramos and John Harkes entered the 
Olympic Stadium in Rome and jogged out to play Italy in the United States' 
second game of the 1990 World Cup. The crowd of 73,659 jeered and snickered in 
delighted anticipation of this team of scrawny college kids being served up to 
the mighty Italian team. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramos and Harkes knocked the ball around in warm-ups, took in the sea of 
Italian flags and the din of the fans, looked at each other and laughed. "What 
are we doing here?" they said. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years of working to establish a presence on the international soccer 
scene has created a sense of belonging for the U.S. World Cup team that was 
expected to yield dividends on the field. The team's opening match against 
Switzerland here Saturday illustrated both the road taken and the distance yet 
to travel. While the 1-1 tie earned the United States its first point in the 
World Cup finals since 1950, it also exposed the growing American reluctance to 
move forward on a soccer field. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping for a victory and three points and settling for a tie and one point is 
the scenario confronting the U.S. team with only two more first-round games. 
Three points out of three games could be enough to advance. Four more likely 
will be required. The urgency of their situation is clear from the team's 
widely expressed belief that, of their Group A opponents, Switzerland was the 
most vulnerable. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt the Swiss regarded the U.S. team similarly. In that respect, both 
teams were disappointed, although neither would confess to it. The Swiss were 
pleased that a defensive misalignment led to the goal by Georges Bregy. The 
U.S. team was delighted with the equalizer, a perfectly struck free kick by 
Eric Wynalda. 
</P>
<P>
 Things began so well. The crowd of 73,425 in the Silverdome -- site of the 
first indoor World Cup game -- was festive and decidedly pro-American. It might 
have been the first time the team has played in front of such a supportive 
crowd in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The team came out in its usual 4-4-2 alignment, with a few changes: Harkes 
played on the left wing instead of central midfield and Cle Kooiman played at 
right back instead of central defender. 
</P>
<P>
 What became apparent from the start was the U.S. team's tendency to string out 
and not offer support. The few times an American forward made any kind of 
penetrating run, there was no teammate there. 
</P>
<P>
 "We left a lot of gaps, we were too spread out as a team," Harkes said. "I 
think there is a lack of cohesion throughout the whole team. We just didn't 
play well today. We didn't squeeze up as a team. We didn't push the ball up. We 
didn't support each other. We need to be a more compact side. There was too 
much responsibility on one individual to perform a miracle." 
</P>
<P>
 No miracles were forthcoming. Neither did the team adjust during the first 
half. In many ways it was one of the U.S. team's oddest matches. The defense, 
its weak link, played exceptionally well. Its offense, where the heavy talent 
lies, was never in sync. 
</P>
<P>
 The team as a whole was shifted too far back on the field, rendering U.S. 
Coach Bora Milutinovic's build-from-the-back style problematic, and time 
consuming. With no ball control in the midfield, the whole game got out of 
whack. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the defense pushes up 10 yards and the midfield pushes up 10 yards, then 
we're closer to the front two (players)," Harkes said. "That allows us to catch 
any second balls that are coming down. If you watch today, Bregy, number six, 
was picking it up, and number seven (Alain Sutter). We didn't have any pressure 
on them initially." 
</P>
<P>
 Bregy's goal on a free kick in the 39th minute was the result of a 
communication problem as the U.S. set up its defensive wall. The players set up 
six yards from the ball and the referee pushed them back to the regulation 10 
yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, we were way out of line," U.S. goalkeeper Tony Meola said. "I 
just decided to hold my ground. I didn't want to get beat on the near post." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he was beaten on the far post. 
</P>
<P>
 But the U.S. team showed its resilience. Harkes made a slashing run and was 
fouled about 10 yards from the penalty area. Ramos, Harkes and Wynalda stood 
over the ball before the ensuing free kick. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda's 28-yard yard kick dipped in under the crossbar. Wynalda, who was 
suffering from an allergic reaction and felt ill during the game, said it was 
the best shot he has ever made. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great goal," said Harkes, who received a yellow card in the second 
half. "I didn't think it was going in. I started to run in, thinking it was 
going to be a rebound. I thought it went over the top, but when I saw the 
spiders in the corner ducked, it opened the cobwebs up." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. made some changes in the second half, but nothing was effective. 
Wynalda was replaced by Roy Wegerle and striker Ernie Stewart was replaced by 
Cobi Jones in an effort to put in fresh legs and speed. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the defense that preserved the tie, with the much-maligned Alexi Lalas 
containing Switzerland's dangerous forward, Stephane Chapuisat. 
</P>
<P>
 To what end? As World Cup host, the U.S. team bears a heavy burden and also 
carries the proclaimed goal of advancing past the first round. One point isn't 
bad, but it puts on pressure for the games against Colombia and Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're missing two points," Lalas said. "We came here hoping to get three 
points. That was our goal. We thought it was pretty realistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Milutinovic, who had leaped with joy from the U.S. bench at the moment of 
Wynalda's goal, walked briskly off the field at the end of the game. As is his 
custom, Milutinovic would neither discuss his players individually nor allow 
any negative connotations to linger. 
</P>
<P>
 As he was hustled up a tunnel leading out of the Silverdome and into the blast 
of afternoon heat and light, Milutinovic turned and shouted, "We are alive."

 The Colorado Rockies, young and erratic, came to Los Angeles limping and ready 
to dive back into the depths of the division. Two nights later. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Are you ready for the pennant-contending Colorado Rockies? 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers, at least on the grim evidence of the last two nights, most 
certainly are not. 
</P>
<P>
 Saturday night, the second-place Rockies took their second consecutive leisure 
tour through the Dodger pitching staff, chopping out 17 hits on their way to 
another laugher, 9-3, before 50,482 at Dodger Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if it's only June and they're five games under .500? Last year at 
about this time, in their first year of existence, the Rockies were 22-44 and 
22 games out of first place. 
</P>
<P>
 On the heels of Friday night's 13-5 victory, this was Colorado's sixth 
consecutive victory at Chavez Ravine, dating back to a four-game sweep last 
August, and it shrunk the Dodger lead in the National League West to three 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, Colorado broke the game open in a four-run sixth, parlaying three 
hits and four walks from four Dodger pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was over and Ramon Martinez, Ismael Valdes and Brian Barnes had all 
wobbled off the mound (and Roger McDowell had finally retired the side), the 
Rockies led, 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
 With the San Francisco Giants still mired in the muck, a strike looming in the 
not-too-distant future and another game against the Dodgers today, the Rockies 
suddenly find themselves as real National League West contenders, despite a 
31-36 record. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you're this close to first place in mid-June, you've got a chance," 
Colorado starter Marvin Freeman said. "You have to give your best effort. We've 
done it the last two games, and I don't see any reason we should stop now." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies bounced out to a 3-0 lead in the second inning on four singles and 
an error, then, in the fourth, Freeman played longball for the first time in 
his major league career. 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman popped a long solo shot into the right-field stands in the fourth 
against Martinez -- the second consecutive start in which Martinez has given up 
a home run to a pitcher. Last Monday, Martinez gave up a solo homer to the 
Reds' Pete Schourek. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man, when I hit it, I was just so happy I made contact two times in a row," 
Freeman said. "When I got around first (base) and I saw (center fielder Brett) 
Butler still running, I thought, 'Hey, I may have something here.' " 
</P>
<P>
 As Colorado Manager Don Baylor looks for a starter to step into a leadership 
role, he might not have to look any further than Freeman: The Rockies are 10-2 
in games Freeman has started this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Freeman (7-1), who has scuffled through stints with the Phillies and 
Braves, think he has earned a spot on the All-Star team? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm old, tired and broken-down, I need the three days off," Freeman said 
recently. "I've got incentives for games pitched, I don't get anything for the 
All-Star game." 
</P>
<P>
 Freeman lasted 5 2/3 innings Saturday night, giving up three runs and six 
hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez (6-3), who got the starting call Saturday afternoon when scheduled 
starter Tom Candiotti was scratched because of a sore toe, had won his last six 
decisions -- including victories in his last three starts. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rockies, who pounded the Dodgers for 16 hits -- including eight for 
extra bases -- on Friday night, continued the pace in the second inning 
Saturday, scoring three runs on four hits and a Dodger error. 
</P>
<P>
 Catcher Joe Girardi led the way, producing run-scoring singles in the second, 
fifth and sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers cut the Rockies' lead to 3-1 in the third when Butler's two-out 
single scored Raul Mondesi, who had doubled to lead off the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Rockies tacked on single runs in the fourth (Freeman's home run) and 
fifth (Girardi's second run-scoring single), their lead was stretched to 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, who had not given up more than five runs in any of his previous 13 
starts, lasted 5 1/3 innings, giving up seven runs and 10 hits while walking 
four and striking out five. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a very good hitting team," Martinez said. "They just put the ball 
in play, make a lot of contact, and that's about it. But we'll get them 
tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring twice in the sixth to narrow the lead to 9-3, the Dodgers 
threatened again in the eighth, when Dave Hansen came up to pinch-hit with two 
out and the bases loaded. But reliever Steve Reed got Hansen to ground to first 
base, and the threat was ended.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; IRELAND MATCHES ITS FANS' VIGOR; GROUP E: 
BUOYED BY UNEXPECTEDLY PARTISAN CROWD, IRISH STUN ITALY, 1-0, ON HOUGHTON'S 
GOAL IN 12TH MINUTE.

<P>
 Irish eyes were wet Saturday, their faces red, their throats sore, their 
spirit overwhelming. 
</P>
<P>
 For two hours at Giants Stadium, 22 overmatched soccer players and about 
50,000 fans transformed foreign soil into a home field. 
</P>
<P>
 The results could be heard from here to County Cork. 
</P>
<P>
 Hustling and tackling with the same fervor as their countrymen sang and 
chanted, Ireland upset Italy, 1-0, in a first-round World Cup game before 
74,826. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ole, ole," said Ireland Prime Minister Albert Reynolds, mimicking the Irish 
fan's favorite chant. "The carnival in Dublin has begun. We will be partying 
until Monday." 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians are behaving as if there might not be a Monday. The loss stunned 
the players to their knees while representing the worst fears of their country 
of critics. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, we suffer much," goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca said. 
</P>
<P>
 Italian forward Roberto Baggio, the 1993 player of the year, already has 
suffered much. 
</P>
<P>
 After Ray Houghton intercepted a header and scored in the 12th minute, the 
defense went to work on Baggio. 
</P>
<P>
 For the rest of the afternoon they did everything but drag him around by his 
ponytail. 
</P>
<P>
 They kicked him. They shoved him. They introduced him to that lovely English 
phrase, "half nelson." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, I think we intimidated them a little bit," lead enforcer Paul McGrath 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio still managed five shots, more than any other two players in the game 
combined. But he spent much of the game with his palms upturned and his eyes 
skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 The Italians had possession of the ball most of the time but, amid 91-degree 
temperatures and thick humidity, only the Irish were left standing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't shoot because we couldn't beat their trapping and pressing," Baggio 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He couldn't beat their fans, either, particularly the large man with green 
hair and a bare chest who nearly tackled Baggio on the field after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Andy Townsend, Ireland midfielder, attempted to persuade police to release the 
man. He even gave the fan a hug. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fans here gave us an absolutely fantastic lift," Townsend said. "You 
think about playing in America, you think about it being an 'away' game. But 
today we realized, not for us." 
</P>
<P>
 With nearby New York City boasting a larger Italian population, it was thought 
that the Irish fans would be barely noticed. But that notion was dispelled when 
they arrived four hours early and papered the stadium with the tri-colored 
banners. 
</P>
<P>
 The emotion of their constant songs carried down to the field, where the Irish 
were appearing in only their second World Cup finals, against a team that has 
won as many World Cup championships -- three -- as any. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory means that the Irish have a good chance of surviving their 
difficult group -- which includes Norway and Mexico -- and advancing to the 
round of 16. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this lets everyone know -- and reaffirms it in our own minds -- that we 
are a team to deal with," veteran defender Kevin Moran said. 
</P>
<P>
 In several ways. 
</P>
<P>
 If this game was any indication, teams know now that they will not be in 
better shape than the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 After training for two weeks in the heat of Orlando, the Irish were so strong 
that half of them didn't even request water in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, teams should know if they let the Irish take a lead, they should run to 
the sidelines for extra pads. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Italian Coach Arrigo Sacchi, who will be lucky if he still has a 
job next month, his team became overwhelmed when Ireland Coach Jack Charlton 
moved Roy Keane from midfield to the defensive line after the first goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That goal took us by surprise, and then they increased their defense and kept 
us off base the rest of the game," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in keeping with a certain stereotype, teams should now wonder whether 
they can out-luck the Irish. 
</P>
<P>
 Their goal came on their only legitimate shot. And even that occurred only 
after legendary defender Franco Baresi carelessly headed a ball to an empty 
space that quickly was filled by Houghton. 
</P>
<P>
 As surprised as anyone, Houghton swung his left foot at the loose ball and 
somehow lifted it over Pagliuca and into the net. 
</P>
<P>
 It will comfort the Italians much to learn that Houghton is right-footed. 
</P>
<P>
 'It was a very good goal by Ray . . . although I don't know if he meant it," 
Charlton said. 
</P>
<P>
 When later told the Italians called it an ugly goal, Houghton laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any goal is a pretty goal," he said. "Our country was already pretty excited 
about it. This victory is going to send them through the roof." 
</P>
<P>
 He certainly meant that.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; COLOMBIA GRABS ONLY THE THORNS; GROUP A: 
HAGI, RADUCIOIU SPARK ROMANIA'S 3-1 VICTORY AT THE ROSE BOWL AS COLOMBIAN 
GOALKEEPER GETS BURNED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Goalkeeper Oscar Cordoba was not supposed to cause hearts to pound wildly or 
faces to flush among Colombian soccer fans. No, this was no clone of the brazen 
Rene Higuita, who would cockily saunter out 20 yards from his goal and flirt 
with danger. 
</P>
<P>
 But Saturday, the normally reliable Cordoba caused Higuita-like reactions from 
the huge Colombian fan contingent among the crowd of 91,856. He committed two 
significant miscues that led to goals, and Romania stunned Colombia, 3-1, in 
the first World Cup game to be played at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanian forward Florin Raducioiu scored twice and the often brilliant 
midfielder Gheorghe Hagi had a hand in every goal, scoring once and setting up 
both of Raducioiu's goals. Goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea was nearly flawless, 
stopping 18 shots, including a point-blank effort by Colombian midfielder 
Freddy Rincon from six yards out in the 23rd minute with Romania ahead, 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 For the moment, one of the pre-World Cup favorites, Colombia, is looking less 
than formidable, ranking last in Group A. It plays the United States at the 
Rose Bowl on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made mistakes we haven't made before," Coach Francisco Maturana said. "We 
were pressured and maybe a little overwhelmed by being in the World Cup. It was 
a good experience for us, a wake-up call." 
</P>
<P>
 "Too much individualism by our players contributed to the defeat. We showed a 
lack of mobility in the midfield, a lack of coherence in the defense and a 
disconnected offense, especially in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still played well in the first half, but in the second half we fell 
apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi, who briefly left the game in the first half with an injured left leg, 
referred to the pre-tournament hype about Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Colombia should not forget Romania has good players," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanian Coach Anghel Iordanescu praised his team for its intelligent attack, 
but its tenacious and compact defense was the key. Colombia was permitted to 
pass the ball around at will in the non-threatening parts of the field, but the 
Romanians opened with a 5-3-2 alignment and, holding a 2-1 lead, switched to a 
6-2-2 in the 68th minute when defender Tibor Selimess replaced midfielder Ilie 
Dumitrescu. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, Colombia's star forward Faustino Asprilla could not seem to go 
anywhere in the second half without seeing the shadow of defender Daniel Prodan 
or feel a tug on his shirt. And playmaking midfielder Carlos Valderrama was a 
non-factor save for a few showy first-half moves.  
</P>
<P>
 Although Colombia had near complete control of the ball in the opening 15 
minutes, as it often happens, Hagi seemingly burst out of nowhere and created 
his magic to set up Raducioiu's first goal in the 16th minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi launched a 25-yard pass and Raducioiu threaded through the maze of 
defenders and cut over, beating Cordoba with a shot inside the right post to 
make it 1-0. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordoba had a near scare in the 24th minute with a long-range Hagi shot, but 
he was able to tip it away. There was no such luck in the 34th minute when Hagi 
converted what almost looked like a short punt, a looping shot from an angle 
off the left flank. Caught out of position, there was no way Cordoba could move 
back and Hagi's shot went in just inside the right post and slightly under the 
bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody made a mistake," Cordoba said of Hagi's goal. "It was a team 
mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 Fittingly, Hagi was not on the field when Colombia scored its only goal to cut 
Romania's lead to 2-1. After getting fouled by Gabriel Jaime Gomez in the 41st 
minute, Hagi left the field on a motorized cart. He returned after Colombian 
forward Aldolfo Valencia scored off a header in the 43rd minute when defender 
Wilson Perez sliced a pinpoint corner kick from the left side. 
</P>
<P>
 Stelea had no chance on the goal. For his part, he thought the biggest play of 
the game was his save on Rincon in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt had that not happened, the game would turned differently," Stelea 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the final goal, which came in the 89th minute, even Cordoba could not blame 
anyone else. Cordoba came out and misplayed the ball, looking as if he took his 
eye off it in concern about a potential collision with Raducioiu. Raducioiu 
dribbled around him and punched the ball into an open net. 
</P>
<P>
 Maturana defended his goalkeeper -- sort of -- when asked whether there would 
be a change for Wednesday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely not," Maturana said. "Although today's game requires analysis."  
</P>
<P>
 Sort of the same way everyone in Colombia has been analyzing Higuita's 
performance in the 1990 World Cup. Four years later, little seems to have 
changed for Colombian soccer fans.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Jim Barnett, a former NBA player and now a TV analyst on Golden State Warrior 
broadcasts, told John Crumpacker of the San Francisco Examiner how coaching 
styles have changed since he played 25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I played for Alex Hannum, he put the fear of God into you," Barnett said 
of his time with the old San Diego Clippers. "I remember one time we had to 
touch every step in the San Diego Sports Arena. He was mad at us one day. 
Couldn't miss a step anywhere in the arena.

 "One scenario has (Phil) Jackson (the Chicago Bulls' coach) moving to coach 
the Knicks in two years when Pat Riley's contract ends and Riley getting a 
part-ownership deal with the Los Angeles Clippers." 
</P>
<P>
 Daydreams: The conversation occurred in the Hollywood Park winner's circle 
after a first-time starter named Mr. Dipper won last Wednesday's ninth race. 
</P>
<P>
 "I dreamed of becoming a jockey when I was growing up on a farm and riding 
plow horses," said the horse's co-owner.  
</P>
<P>
 The man shaking his hand said, "When I was a kid, I never wanted to be 
anything but a basketball player."  
</P>
<P>
 Wilt Chamberlain and jockey Kent Desormeaux never realized those boyhood 
ambitions. 
</P>

 Farewell Ken?Bill Conlin in the Philadelphia Daily News: "Seattle is

WHEN LACHEMANN CALLS, HUDLER DELIVERS; BASEBALL: TWO-RUN HOME RUN IN SIXTH 
INNING HELPS ANGELS TO 4-3 VICTORY OVER WHITE SOX. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann knew it hardly was fair. Come to think of it, 
it was rather cruel. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the one responsible for sending veteran Rex Hudler to the disabled 
list, and while Hudler was gone, he lost his second base job to Damion Easley. 
He tried to gently break the news. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he felt bad about it," Hudler said, "but I told him, 'Hey, no 
problem. I'll play anywhere you want. I can play anywhere but pitcher or 
catcher, and if you really need me to, I'll catch.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So guess who Lachemann turned to Saturday night when he suddenly needed a left 
fielder, and guess who hit a two-run homer to help the Angels to a 4-3 victory 
over the Chicago White Sox? 
</P>
<P>
 Hudler, the man they call Wonder Dog, broke a 2-2 tie in the sixth inning by 
hitting a home run against Jason Bere that landed 386 feet away in the White 
Sox bullpen. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like that, the Angels (30-39) had their third consecutive victory, moving 
within 2 1/2 games of the Texas Rangers, and convincing themselves once again 
that they can win the American League West title. 
</P>
<P>
 Wow, winning three in row at Comiskey Park sure must have a way of changing a 
team's morale. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, the way we've been going," said Joe Grahe, who earned his 11th save, 
"winning three in a row at a Pony League field would have been a big lift." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps there is no player more capable of lifting the Angels' morale than 
Hudler, who ate a worm during a game last season in Japan and swallowed a June 
bug while playing for the St. Louis Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you need to rally your team," Hudler said, "I'll try anything. You never 
know what will work." 
</P>
<P>
 Said starter Mark Langston: "He adds so much to our team. His adrenaline is 
always going anyway, but when he plays, it's a whole new level. That lifts 
everyone up." 
</P>
<P>
 Take a look at the proof. The Angels were in first place with a 23-26 record, 
and Hudler was batting .406, when Lachemann and Hudler raced for a loose ball 
during batting practice on May 28. Lachemann accidentally flung his fungo bat 
while going for the ball, Hudler flipped, landed on his shoulder and spent 17 
days on the disabled list. 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels proceeded to lose 12 of 15 games. Hudler was activated Tuesday. 
What happens? The Angels have won four of five. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ain't no catalyst, and I ain't no star player," Hudler said. "But I can 
help a team. This is one of the biggest homers I've hit in a long, long time. I 
hit a couple in Japan, but come on, man, that was Japan. This is the big 
leagues." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Langston (4-4) became the latest pitcher to stymie the White Sox's 
potent offense. He not only yielded six hits and three earned runs in 6 1/3 
innings, but also vented his frustrations about what he believes to be 
preferential umpiring treatment toward Chicago first baseman Frank Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston was convinced that he struck out Thomas in the first inning on a 
3-and-2 pitch, but instead watched in disbelief as home-plate umpire Tim Welke 
called it a ball for Thomas' league-leading 61st walk. 
</P>
<P>
 Langston became irate, walking toward the plate and yelling so loudly at Welke 
that his voice could be heard in the press box. It wound up costing Langston a 
run, and he again yelled at Welke while he walked off the field at the inning's 
conclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "A guy is hitting (.377), and you kind of wonder why, and then you see," 
Langston said. "Frank Thomas is a good enough hitter as it is, he doesn't need 
any help. 
</P>
<P>
 "That pitch is a strike in any league, in any situation. It's very rare that 
I'll say something, but I've been around long enough that I'm going to voice my 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You start giving him stuff, and that puts us in a big hole. To allow him to 
lock in on stuff right over the plate, that's unfair."

 No matter, Langston survived Thomas' 24th home run in the third inning, and 
watched in admiration as the bullpen tandem of Mark Leiter and Grahe pitched 
the final 2 2/3 innings without giving up a hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been through some times, every one of us," said Grahe, who pitched a 
1-2-3 ninth. "We struggled together, but we stuck together. Nobody threw in the 
towel."

 The World Cup had just been placed on a pedestal by former U.S. soccer 
Olympian Jim Fox, and the firecrackers for this opening ceremony were making it 
the Fourth of July in the Arroyo Seco around the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 All eyes drifted from soccer's Holy Grail, the Cup, being projected upward 
about 20 feet by some sort of hydraulic device that made it look like a rocket 
at ignition, to the north rim of the bowl, where the fireworks had reached 
their crescendo and were leaving a heavy cloud of smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 And then, near the top of the smoke, flew the airplane, towing a sign that 
said: "1+1: Andres Presidente." 
</P>
<P>
 It was political campaigning at its opportune best. Today is election day in 
Colombia, and one of the presidential candidates is Andres Pastrana. 
</P>
<P>
 One discussion among the Colombian press had to do with how this soccer game 
would impact on the election. 
</P>
<P>
 Some speculated that the politicians involved were all hoping for a tie game, 
because a victory or a loss might trigger a long night of either reveling or 
mourning in Colombia. And that might have a direct impact on voter turnout 
today. BILL DWYRE

 One of the more interesting Irish banners read, "We Come For The Beer, We Come 
For The Craic, But Don't Be Surprised If We Bring The Cup Back." 
</P>
<P>
 "Craic," pronounced "crack," is Gaelic for "good times." 
</P>
<P>
 "You tell everybody that the Irish are coming over here for 'craic' and see 
what they say," said Ben O'Brien, a Dublin student. "Somebody hears that and 
they're liable to arrest us." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike their English counterparts, the Irish fans have a reputation for being 
polite and well-behaved. This was reinforced Saturday when many mistakenly 
arrived at Giants Stadium an hour before the gates opened, yet did not 
complain. 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in everything from green wigs to tri-colored flags, they roamed the 
parking lot singing, posing for pictures and greeting everyone with, "God 
bless." BILL PLASCHKE

 Some Dallas security volunteers for the World Cup are not thrilled with their 
outfits, which are military-looking, khaki uniforms, replete with purple 
berets. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked what he thought of his garb, one volunteer countered, "What do you 
think of it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Then he and a friend covered their identification badges for fear of being 
identified. 
</P>
<P>
 Assured of confidentiality, one of the security men said of the beret, "I 
would describe it as a purple, winter toupee in the middle of summer. Not very 
fashionable." CHRIS DUFRESNE

 The U.S. team is accustomed to playing before hostile crowds, even at home. 
Against Mexico at the Rose Bowl on June 4, most of a crowd of more than 90,000 
was clearly rooting for the visitors. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why the players said they were so overcome by the reception given them 
by a decidedly pro-American Silverdome crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 "I walked out and I almost started crying," defender Marcelo Balboa said. "The 
emotion takes over for you. You walk out and you hear the cheers and yelling 
and it's incredible." 
</P>
<P>
 Said forward Eric Wynalda: "It was great. That is what got us up, having 
people on our side. It seems like most of our crowds are anti-American." 
</P>
<P>
 Balboa said that at times the partisan crowd was so loud he was unable to 
communicate with defender Alexi Lalas: "He's standing right next to me. I'm 
screaming at the top of my lungs, and he can't hear me."  
</P>
<P>
 Swiss fans were also vocal. They filled two sections of the upper deck, and 
after Georges Bregy's goal they became a bright red, dancing throng. 
</P>
<P>
 "We couldn't wait until the game started," midfielder Tab Ramos said. "It's 
probably the greatest feeling I've had playing in the United States. And it was 
nice to see a lot of Swiss fans here." EMILIO GARCIA-RUIZ

 Bob Gansler, director of coaching for the U.S. Soccer Federation, liked the 
U.S. World Cup opener Saturday more than the 1990 opener.He was coaching the 
team in Italy in 1990, when it lost its first game to Czechoslovakia, 5-1. 
</P>
<P>
 "Six guys who opened against the Czechs played today, and when you add Thomas 
Dooley, Ernie Stewart and Roy Wegerle, you've got a team with some experience," 
Gansler said. "Instead of a graduate-school team like we had, you've got a 
young pro team out there now." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Balboa, a veteran of the '90 team: "We know we are a better team than 
'90. We knew '90 wasn't going to happen again." EMILIO GARCIA-RUIZ

 According to the Chicago Tribune, Soldier Field on Friday looked nothing like 
it does when the Chicago Bears play. 
</P>
<P>
 The weather was dangerously hot, with 41 people treated for heat exhaustion 
and 13 of them hospitalized after Germany defeated Bolivia, 1-0, in the opening 
game of the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Colorful clothes, flags, banners and streamers were the norm, and songs were 
sung and cheers yelled in Spanish and German. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a well-behaved crowd, attributed, the Tribune said, to its being 
generally sober. Beer sales ended after halftime, much to the dismay of some 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 About the only place where there was no wait was a place known for long lines: 
the women's rest room. The crowd was overwhelmingly male. MARTHA VARGAS-SEAGLE

 The hot rumor, hotter even than the weather and talk of the humidity, was that 
Belgian players had been seen at an Orlando-area nightclub Friday night.Asked 
if the rumor is true, Coach Paul Van Himst -- who counts English among the 
handful of languages he speaks -- was suddenly struck by selective 
comprehension. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was left to team press officer Guido de Windt to field the question. "We

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; SPOTLIGHT; PLAYERS HIGH ON GRASS AT

 The grass playing surface at the Silverdome met with mostly positive reviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-celebrated surface for the first indoor World Cup game is the pride 
of Michigan State turf researchers.Grown in California, the sod was cut, rolled 
and shipped by truck to Michigan in April, 1992. It was transplanted into metal 
boxes, most in the shape of hexagons that are 7 1/2 feet across, and drew raves 
from Germany and England when they played an exhibition on it in June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1,850 hexagons, 100 triangles and 44 trapezoids had been kept in the 
Silverdome parking lot, and moving them inside and arranging them into a soccer 
field took 1,000 man-hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Players on Saturday said the surface was slippery, and it resulted in numerous 
falls, but Bregy of Switzerland and Wynalda of the United States, the 
goal-scorers, blamed the problem on improper cleats. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a fantastic atmosphere," Bregy said. "It was really great to play in 
a dome like this. I liked the turf." EMILIO GARCIA-RUIZ

<P>
 Some reviews of the opening day of World Cup 94: 
</P>
<P>
 The Times of London, from Chicago: "The World Cup USA 94 got off to a 
faltering start at Soldier Field last night. Diana Ross, first lady of American 
soul, was supposed to enter the arena and kick a ball from the penalty spot 
towards the center of goal, but she kicked it wide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nevertheless, the goal opened impressively to reveal the banners of the 24 
competing nations, a symbolic welcome later endorsed by President Clinton to 
demonstrate that his country was ready to seek a place in the history of the 
world game. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Manchester Guardian, from Chicago: "Those Americans convinced that the 
World Cup is going to be unspeakably boring were handed some hard evidence 
yesterday when the 1994 tournament began -- in keeping with ancient tradition 
-- with an insufferably dreary and low-scoring match. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The players, like the 63,000 spectators, had to contend with ludicrous 
conditions. The temperature was 95 degrees in the shade. . . .

 "Usually the sporting affairs of the planet are arranged for the benefit of 
American television. This time the boot was on the other foot. The game began 
at 2 p.m. on a working Friday, so it could be seen in European prime time. . .

 A minor journalistic and diplomatic flap was avoided Saturday in Orlando by 
venue press officer Jim Henderson, a former journalist. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian Coach Paul Van Himst said Belgian journalists would be allowed to 
watch his team's practice at the Florida Citrus Bowl but barred reporters from 
other countries.That ruling angered reporters from Morocco, who wanted to scout 
their country's opponent, as well as reporters from other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Henderson ruled that the session had to be open to all reporters, or to none 
-- and Van Himst promptly closed the practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know it got some people angry, but that's the only fair way to do it," 
Henderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morocco avoided controversy by closing its practice to everyone and by 
refusing interviews after its hourlong practice. HELENE ELLIOTT

 Belgian press officer Guido de Windt didn't seem to be amused by midfielder 
Lorenzo Staelens' inability to cope with the high humidity and searing heat 
that have blanketed central Florida since the Belgian team arrived. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is the only player of 22 who can't get used to it," De Windt said. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's exceptionally hot today, Staelens probably won't start. "(Coach Van 
Himst) wants to start with a team that's 100% OK," De Windt said. "If he's not 
100% OK and he has to come out at the half, what good is that?" HELENE ELLIOTT

WI GETTING BACK INTO THE SWING; GOLF: PLAYING COMPETITIVELY AGAIN AFTER LONG 
LAYOFF, HE FINISHES SECOND IN QUALIFIER FOR STATE AMATEUR CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Charlie Wi, an area golfer of considerable repute, went through golf 
withdrawal and dropped out of sight.  
</P>
<P>
 By the time Wi teed off last month in a qualifying event for the 83rd State 
Amateur championship, he was darn near trembling. He hadn't played 
competitively since late last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really nervous," Wi said. 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't show. Wi shot 145 over 36 holes at Wood Ranch Country Club in Simi 
Valley to place second and advance with ease, which shouldn't exactly raise 
many eyebrows. The fact that the popular, effervescent Wi was anxious 
beforehand could cause a few brows to wrinkle, though. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Amateur begins Monday on the Monterey Peninsula and Wi, 22, 
definitely knows the scenic terrain. He won the prestigious event two weeks 
after graduating from Westlake High in 1990. Last year, he advanced to the 
second round of match play before losing on the third hole of a sudden death 
playoff. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, he played in the U.S. Amateur, but then transferred to Cal from 
Nevada before the 1993-94 school year and redshirted. He will be a fifth-year 
senior in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 All he did to fill time at Cal was practice, practice, practice. He didn't 
have much choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of tough not playing (in college tournaments)," Wi said. "But I 
learned a lot by sitting out." 
</P>
<P>
 So it seems. The evidence indicates there are few signs of rust. Last weekend 
at the Southwestern Amateur in Phoenix, Wi placed fifth in a field of 208 at 
the Arizona Country Club with a 72-hole total of 286, two under par. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was playing at Nevada, Wi said, he went through the motions in 
practice -- which he considered a necessary evil between competitive rounds. 
However, he benefited from the redshirt experience at Cal, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "By sitting and watching, I think I became a better player," Wi said. "I took 
the game a lot more seriously. When you're always playing, you don't take 
practicing seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Wi also has been selected to play in the North-South team competition. He is 
one of six members of the South team, which will compete in a match within a 
match. His scores during the stroke-play portion of the tournament Monday and 
Tuesday will count toward the team total. 
</P>
<P>
 But the real business at hand is the individual race. A field of 102 will play 
two rounds of stroke play before a 36-hole cut. The field will be split Monday 
between Spyglass Hill Golf Course and Pebble Beach Golf Links. The field will 
switch sites Tuesday with the low 32 players advancing to match play at Pebble 
Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A minor adjustment was made in the tournament format, which resulted in the 
event being lengthened by one day. Only one round of match play will be held on 
both Wednesday and Thursday, instead of two. Previously, the afternoon round of 
match play on Wednesday took as long as six hours to complete because the 
public is allowed to play the course after competitors playing in morning 
matches have teed off. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think it will help bring back the over-40 crowd," said Bob Thomas, an 
official with the Southern California Golf Assn. "We've had some players over 
40 who could have made a run at the title over the past few years, but they ran 
out of gas (in the afternoon matches)." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the eight players from the region who qualified won't have to worry 
about the age factor -- all but two are 25 or younger including Brandon 
DiTullio, 17, who will be a senior next fall at Westlake High. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Wright, a Buena High graduate who just completed his freshman year at 
USC, is 18. Yasu Amaya, a Birmingham High graduate who now lives in Fresno, is 
20. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamey Forsyth of Chatsworth and Paul Tanner of Sun Valley are 25. David Saylor 
of West Hills is the veteran of the bunch at 41. Saylor won the qualifier at 
Wood Ranch at 144. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Steinberg of Van Nuys, 36, also qualifies as a relative graybeard, 
particularly in terms of experience. Steinberg, a USC graduate, three times has 
reached the State Amateur quarterfinals and twice reached the semifinals. He 
has won the SCGA amateur championship three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey Boyns of Pacific Grove, a caddie at Pebble Beach, will try to become the 
first player in 40 years to win consecutive titles. Stanford-bound Tiger Woods 
of Anaheim, the three-time U.S. Junior Amateur champion, is entered for the 
first time.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; INDIANS' VICTORY IS 17TH IN A ROW AT CLEVELAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nobody, not even old nemesis Roger Clemens, can stop these Cleveland Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians broke a 43-year-old team record with their 17th consecutive home 
victory Saturday, beating Clemens and the Boston Red Sox, 8-2, behind home runs 
by Albert Belle and Carlos Baerga. 
</P>
<P>
 The Red Sox have lost 10 in a row, matching their longest skid since they 
dropped 11 in a row in 1932. They've had four 10-game losing streaks since. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians, playing at new Jacobs Field, surpassed the franchise mark of 16 
consecutive home victories set at Cleveland Stadium in 1951. It's the best home 
streak in the majors since Boston won a record 24 in a row at Fenway Park in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The loss dropped Clemens' record against Cleveland to 18-5. Although he once 
dominated the Indians, he is 0-3 in his last six starts against them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if you ever get on an equal footing with Roger Clemens. But this 
is a much different ballclub than he faced in other years," Cleveland Manager 
Mike Hargrove said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians have won eight in a row overall, giving them the best record in 
the league at 39-25. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 11, Texas 10 -- Terry Steinbach's three-run homer capped a five-run 
ninth-inning rally at Arlington, Tex., and the A's then hung on after the 
Rangers rallied in the bottom of the inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Clark hit a two-run homer in the Texas ninth before rookie Carlos Reyes 
got the final out for his first major league save. 
</P>
<P>
 Geronimo Berroa went four for five for the A's, who have won a season-high 
five in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 4, Milwaukee 2 -- Danny Tartabull's 469-foot homer broke a 
sixth-inning tie and enabled the Yankees to end a five-game home losing streak. 
The New York victory also ended the Brewers' four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore 11, Minnesota 6 -- Chris Hoiles, Tim Hulett and Cal Ripken hit home 
runs at Baltimore, but the Orioles had to withstand an equal number of homers 
by the Twins to win for the ninth time in 13 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Detroit 6, Toronto 5 -- The Tigers homered in their 24th consecutive game -- 
one short of the major league record -- and later won in the 11th inning at 
Detroit on Alan Trammell's single. 
</P>
<P>
 Trammell, Chris Gomez and Mickey Tettleton homered for Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
 Seattle 3, Kansas City 1 -- Tino Martinez hit a two-run double in the ninth 
inning at Kansas City to key a three-run rally.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; REDS BURY BRAVES UNDER A 16-0 AVALANCHE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Cincinnati Reds sent the Atlanta Braves to their worst loss in nearly 16 
years Saturday night as Reggie Sanders and Brian Dorsett homered in a 16-0 rout 
at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the second biggest margin of defeat in Braves' history. Atlanta lost to 
Montreal, 19-0, on July 30, 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Barry Larkin who scored three runs, and Bret Boone, who drove in three, each 
had four hits for Cincinnati. The Reds had 20 hits, their most since July 27, 
1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Winner John Smiley (5-8) stopped his personal six-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Loser Tom Glavine (7-7) already has one more defeat than he had last season 
when he was 22-6. Glavine gave up six runs in 6 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia 8, Montreal 4 -- Pitcher Danny Jackson drove in five runs, nearly 
a third of his career total, and won his fourth consecutive decision, improving 
to 9-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson, a career .122 hitter with 17 RBIs entering the game, hit a 
bases-loaded triple in the second inning and a two-run double in the sixth at 
Montreal. 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson has hit in five of his last eight games, going seven for 20 with seven 
RBIs. He is batting .243 this season. Jackson is the first Philadelphia player 
to drive in five runs in a game this year. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 11, Florida 3 -- Todd Hundley, batting only .098 lifetime against the 
Marlins coming in, hit two home runs at Miami, giving him 12, one more than his 
previous career best in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Reliever Doug Linton (6-2) was the winner, snapping Florida's four-game 
winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Rapp (4-2) lost for the first time since April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 9, Pittsburgh 0 -- Tom Pagnozzi's second career grand slam 
highlighted a six-run sixth inning at St. Louis, enabling the Cardinals to snap 
a four-game losing streak. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh starter Denny Neagle (6-8) and Allen Watson were both pitching 
shutouts when a thunderstorm halted play for 1:50 in the bottom of the fifth. 
</P>
<P>
 Rene Arocha, (4-3) who relieved Watson after the rain delay, blanked the 
Pirates on five hits over three innings. 
</P>
<P>
 Chicago 6, San Francisco 4 -- Glenallen Hill drove in a career-high five runs 
and broke a ninth-inning tie with a two-run double at San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Four Cub pitchers combined on a two-hitter, holding the Giants hitless after 
the fourth. Dan Plesac (2-2) got the win, Randy Myers the save (his 14th) and 
Bryan Hickerson (2-6) the loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston 6, San Diego 1 -- The Padres' Bip Roberts extended his hitting streak 
to 21 games, the NL high this season, but it wasn't enough to avert this loss 
at San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Caminiti drove in three runs and Jeff Bagwell (.347) went three for three 
with two RBIs to lead Houston. Shane Reynolds (4-3) beat Mike Campbell (0-1), 
making his first major league start since 1989 with Seattle.

BERGANIO SLIPS IN U.S. OPEN AS LUCK RUNS OUT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PAIGE A. LEECH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A day earlier, David Berganio Jr. got away with it. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the third round of the U.S. Open at Oakmont County Club in Oakmont, 
Pa., Berganio's good fortune disappeared and he finished with a five-over-par 
76, his worst round of the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of struggled all day," Berganio, 25, said Saturday. "I'm not hitting 
the ball real well. I wasn't hitting the ball real well (Friday), but today it 
caught up with me." 
</P>
<P>
 Berganio, playing in his first Open as a professional, shot a 72 in the second 
round on Friday to make the 36-hole cut on the demanding 6,946-yard course. 
</P>
<P>
 A day later, Berganio misfired on several drives and subsequently fell deeper 
into the pack of also-rans. 
</P>
<P>
 He parred the first two holes, but three-putted on the third and finished with 
a bogey on the 421-yard, par-4 hole. He bogeyed the sixth and seventh holes, 
then had a chance to get even early on the back nine, but missed a 10-foot putt 
for an eagle and didn't recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "(I'm in) the fourth round of the U.S. Open," he said. "A lot of people are 
wishing they were here, so I'm not gonna sulk over a 76." 
</P>
<P>
 Heading into today's final round, Ernie Els of South Africa is in the lead. 
Els, who shot a 66 on Saturday, is at seven-under-par 206, two strokes ahead of 
Frank Nobilo. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Pate, a resident of Agoura Hills who played at UCLA, fired a par 71 and 
sits in a three-way tie for ninth place at 211 with Greg Norman and John Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 Berganio, 221 after 54 holes, said he will head home tonight to Sylmar, where 
he will relax for two weeks before rejoining the Nike tour.

COLLINS IS JUST IN TIME TO ADVANCE; SURFING: HE SCORES WELL ON FINAL WAVE OF 
HEAT TO SQUEAK INTO SEMIFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODY BERGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With only 30 seconds to go, Richie Collins needed a near-perfect wave and an 
equally impressive ride if he was going to advance to the quarterfinal round in 
the Body Glove Oceanside surf contest. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins milked all he could from his first wave in the 20-minute heat, and 
then the surf, which had been four to five feet high all day, died suddenly. On 
the few waves he caught in the next 15 minutes, Collins scored fours and fives 
on the 10-point scale. In the last minute, he was in last place and needed an 
8.67 to move into second and advance. 
</P>
<P>
 A Newport Beach native sitting fourth in the national surf standings, Collins 
caught the last possible wave, carved into it as long as it held and scored an 
8.83. He beat Joey Jenkins of North Hollywood by .15 points to survive the 
third round of the main event. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's like winning the Op Pro right there," Collins said. "I thought the 
days of winning my heats like that were long gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins began competing 11 years ago at age 14. He competed the last five 
years on the world tour and has done well on the national tour. Twice he 
finished fourth in this event, the sixth of 11 stops on the Bud Surf Tour. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just thinking, 'Why does this keep happening to me? I'm just not 
getting any waves,' " Collins said after the results became official. "In my 
career, I never score below a 5.5, and here I got a 4.5. I feel like I'm 
learning all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Collins also suffers from four herniated discs in his back, the result of 
surfing and windsurfing injuries. Twice he's been carried out of the water 
after contests because of back pain, most dramatically after winning the 1992 
Rip Curl Classic at Bells Beach in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been fine for four months, but then this morning it started hurting," he 
said. "I'll take an anti-inflammatory (drug) to surf tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Dino Andino and Shane Beschen, both of San Clemente, advanced to the 
quarterfinals by surviving the day's toughest heat. The surf picked up just 
before the two former Bud Surf Tour champions took on a third in Mike Parsons, 
a world tour competitor who won the national tour in 1991. Pat O'Connell, who 
co-starred in the recently released motion picture "Endless Summer II" and 
ranks seventh in the nation, rounded out the foursome. 
</P>
<P>
 Each surfer earns points from the best three waves he catches in the 20-minute 
heat. O'Connell's score of 22.04 would have been enough to advance in any other 
heat, but against Beschen and Andino, it was only enough for third. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a pulse from an incoming swell," tour director Ian Cairns said of 
the improved conditions. "That's what it will look like tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor Knox suffered the biggest upset of the day when he was called for 
paddling interference while trying to beat another surfer to a wave. The 
violation reduces a surfer's score to their top two waves instead of three. A 
Carlsbad native who competes on the world tour, Knox was an early favorite for 
the event along with Chris Brown and Rob Machado. 
</P>
<P>
 Knox protested the call, but it stood. "Without the interference, he'd have 
won the heat," Cairns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and Machado, who finished first and second in Oceanside in 1993, easily 
advanced, as did Noah Budroe, Todd Prestage and Todd Miller. Jeff Deffenbaugh 
of Huntington Beach finished second to Machado in the third round of the main 
event. 
</P>
<P>
 Deffenbaugh, who won the most recent tour event and is second to Kelly Slater 
in international competition, performs well on the Oceanside beach break, which 
is similar to conditions in Huntington Beach, and has made the quarterfinals 
the last two years. Surfing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 In Morey Bodyboarding competition, Guilherme Tamega of Brazil found himself in 
the uncomfortable position of competing against his girlfriend of five years. 
Daniela Greitas, who was seeded 34th and performed well in Friday's trials to 
advance to the main round, first heat, where she met second-seeded Tamega and 
No. 15 Brian Wise. Tamega and Hawaiian Mark Dale advanced to the quarterfinals 
today at 8 a.m. . . . Surfing semifinals begin at 11:20 a.m., and the finals 
are scheduled for 12:45 p.m. The winner earns 1,000 points on the world 
qualifying series, which provides a way onto the world championship tour, and 
$4,000. . . . Bodyboarding finals begin at 12:10 p.m. and the winner receives 
$1,500.

DIGEST: TROVATTEN NAMED AS FOOTBALL COACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Trovatten has been named head football coach at St. Genevieve High. 
Trovatten, 40, replaces Richard Fong, the 1993 Times Valley football coach of 
the year, who left St. Genevieve after last season to take an assistant 
coaching position at Crespi. 
</P>

 Chris Beck, a right-handed pitcher from The Master's, has signed with the 
Seattle Mariners and will be assigned to the Mariners' short-season Class-A 
team in Bellingham, Wash., he said Saturday. Beck, the Mariners' seventh-round 
pick in the draft earlier this month, was 5-7 in his senior year with the 
Mustangs this season.

 Adam West, a left-handed pitcher out of Thousand Oaks High and Pierce College, 
has signed with the St. Louis Cardinals and will play for the Cardinals' team 
in the rookie-level Arizona League. 
</P>
<P>
 West, who was drafted in the 30th round, will simply move from Scottsdale, 
Ariz., where he was playing for the Scottsdale Braves in the Arizona Collegiate 
League, to Chandler, Ariz., site of the Cardinals' affiliate. West, who was 
10-4 with a 2.95 earned-run average for the Brahmas in 1994, opted to sign 
rather than accept a scholarship to University of the Pacific.

 Cardinal scout Chuck Fick, who signed Tighe Curran last year, has now signed 
both left-handers from the Newbury Oaks American Legion team that he coached to 
the World Series title in 1992.

 "When I first became a scout, I said it would be nice if I could sign my two 
best left-handers," Fick said. "It's a dream for me. If I could see them 
pitching in the big leagues in five years, it'd be a great story." JEFF

 One of the founding members of the Western Racing Assn. was critically injured 
when his vintage midget race car flipped over during a demonstration race at 
Saugus Speedway Saturday night.  
</P>
<P>
 63, of Burbank was airlifted to UCLA Medical Center after being attended to by 
on-site paramedics for several minutes following the incident which occurred 
during intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just an unfortunate accident or mishap," WRA President Dan Fleisher 
said after the accident. "He's being transported to the hospital for further 
observations."  
</P>
<P>
 The incident delayed race action for several minutes. At one point, emergency 
crews attached white sheets to the track's protective fencing to shield Grosso 
from view of many of the more than 3,000 in attendance.  
</P>
<P>
 Grosso was in the middle of the 20-car field exhibition when he collided with 
Rudy Sorer's midget car that had spun out in the center of the main 
straightaway.  
</P>
<P>
 Sorer was also injured in the collision and was transported by ambulance to 
nearby Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital for further observation with a 
possible broken elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 25-lap Street Stock oval main event, Rich Ocheltree of Sherman Oaks 
passed pole-sitter Brian Kelley of Arleta on the second lap and held on to win 
his first feature race of the season.

HOLLYWOOD PARK; SARDULA STRIDES CONVINCINGLY TO WIN PRINCESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Around horses his entire life and on his own as a trainer since 1966, Brian 
Mayberry doesn't hesitate when asked about Sardula. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never had a horse as good as she is," he said after the 3-year-old Storm 
Cat filly did exactly what she was supposed to in the $102,700 Princess Stakes 
Saturday at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1-10 favorite against three opponents, Sardula drew away through the 
stretch after battling with Pirate's Revenge through an extremely quick 44 
4/5-second half-mile. With Eddie Delahoussaye sitting still, she cruised home 
by 5 1/2 lengths in 1:42 1/5 for the 1 1/16 miles. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the sixth victory in eight starts for Sardula, owned by Mr. and Mrs. 
Jerry Moss, and she is unbeaten in three races in 1994. A half-length loss in 
the Oak Leaf and a head defeat in the Breeders' Cup Juvenile Fillies -- both at 
the hands of Phone Chatter -- are all that separates her from perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 "She ran a great race, but I was a little worried down the backside when they 
were going that fast," said Mayberry. "But she's such a great filly and Eddie 
said she won very easily. We've been working to get her to relax, but I was 
still concerned early. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, when you have Eddie Delahoussaye on, why, like I've said over and over 
again, he's got so much confidence in her. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's got bigger and stronger (since last year). With the precocious ones 
that run well early sometimes, I feel that they are limited as far as they're 
going to run. And when you get one like this that continues to grow before your 
eyes, those are the best ones. That's been my experience anyway. She's right at 
the peak of her game." 
</P>
<P>
 The Princess was the prep for the July 10 Hollywood Oaks and fans would like 
to see a Sardula-Lakeway rematch. They got together for the first time in the 
Kentucky Oaks, with Sardula winning by a head on May 6. Lakeway went to New 
York a week ago and easily captured the Mother Goose. The daughter of Seattle 
Slew may stay home for the Hollywood Oaks or return to New York for the 
Coaching Club American Oaks a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoussaye would feel comfortable against Lakeway or any other 3-year-old 
filly. Riding for the first time since Sunday, he won his first three races 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sardula just ran super," he said. "I didn't want to go to the lead, but it 
looked like it was going to be a match race (with 5-1 second choice Pirate's 
Revenge), according to the (Daily Racing) Form. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think we were going as fast as we did early, but she relaxed OK 
midway down the backside. We were down on the inside, but she's got so much 
heart, she's unbelievable. 
</P>
<P>
 "She just ran a super race and she keeps improving. But, next time, in the big 
race (the Hollywood Oaks), hopefully, we'll lay off the pace." 
</P>
<P>
 Fancy 'N Fabulous, who trailed for the first six furlongs, rallied for second, 
six lengths in front of a tired Pirate's Revenge. Espadrille finished last. 
Baby Diamonds was scratched. 
</P>
<P>
 Never worse than second in her first six starts, Pirate's Revenge would have 
finished second Saturday if she hadn't challenged Sardula from the outset. 
Those two had 12 lengths on the field after a half-mile and eight after six 
furlongs. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Trainer) Ron (Ellis) told me to just break and make the attempt of going to 
the lead, then maybe Sardula would take out," said Chris Antley, who rode 
Pirate's Revenge. "He said that this may be the only shot we have of beating 
her. But, by the time we got to the first turn, (Sardula) had run into the 
bridle. We were just galloping along and I kept looking at (Sardula), and, 
shoot, she had her ears pricked the whole way. Sardula is special." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Fumo Di Londra, an easy winner of the Spotlight Breeders' Cup Handicap in his 
last start, is the 8-5 favorite in the $100,000-added Cinema Handicap today at 
Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Purchased by Jenny and Sid Craig with the hope he would be a Kentucky Derby 
horse, Fumo Di Londra failed miserably in his first U.S. start and first try on 
the dirt. He finished last, beaten 31 lengths by Tabasco Cat, in the San Rafael 
on March 6 at Santa Anita. 
</P>
<P>
 Given time off afterward by trainer Ron McAnally, the Indian Ridge colt 
returned to the turf in the Spotlight and led throughout as the 2-1 favorite. 
He has captured four of his eight starts on grass. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfinished Symph, second in the Spotlight and the 16-1 winner of the Will 
Rogers Handicap, is the 3-1 second choice in the Cinema, which is run at 1 1/8 
miles. Gary Baze will again be aboard for trainer Wesley Ward. Horse Racing 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Alex The Great, a 6-1 shot ridden by Pat Valenzuela, won the $300,000 Golden 
Gate Handicap Saturday in a four-horse blanket finish. Favored Fanmore was 
second, just in front of Emerald Jig and Sir Mark Sykes. Rodney Rash trains 
Alex The Great for owner Berry Gordy . . . . Sal Gonzalez Jr. was suspended for 
five days beginning Wednesday after being disqualified on Its Beer Thirty in 
last Thursday's fifth race . . . . Victor Trujillo won his first race at 
Hollywood Park, directing Et Voila to victory in the ninth. Trujillo replaced 
Alex Solis, who had taken off his remaining mounts after the Princess because 
of a sore right leg. Solis had banged the leg in the starting gate in a race 
Friday night . . . . There were seven correct tickets in the National Best 
Seven and, based on a 50-cent bet, they paid $23.396 and six was worth $53.60. 
The total pool was $373,393.50.

TIMES BOARD OF ADVISERS / J. EUGENE GRIGSBY III: L.A.'S DIVERSE PROBLEMS CALL 
FOR MORE DIVERSITY IN LEADERSHIP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. EUGENE GRIGSBY III, J. EUGENE GRIGSBY III is director of UCLA's Center 
for Afro-American Studies and an associate professor in the university's 
Graduate School of Architecture and Urban Planning. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nelson Mandela's recent election as South Africa's president officially 
proclaimed the death of apartheid and opened a new frontier of democracy. To 
further the country's development, American corporate investment is purportedly 
necessary. Many U.S. corporate leaders have accepted this premise and strongly 
advocate such action. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 1992 events here in Los Angeles, a similar argument was made -- 
namely, that in order for Angelenos to prosper, corporate America would have to 
reinvest in the most devastated areas of the city. But this reinvestment never 
materialized. Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Various reasons have been given: The economic climate is not yet ready for 
major capital investment; prices of goods and labor are lower outside the inner 
city; operating in crime-ridden areas is not cost-effective. Clearly, all of 
these factors have contributed to corporate America's hesitancy to reinvest in 
cities nationally, not just Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps there's another more fundamental reason: the unstated assumption 
that only whites have economic clout and that "taking care of one's own" is the 
best way to improve things.  
</P>
<P>
 I suggest the problem stems from a lack of diversity among key decision 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
 Two committee meetings I recently attended illustrate this point. 
</P>
<P>
 At one -- where all my colleagues were white -- we were discussing a 
multimillion-dollar capital campaign for a nonprofit entity whose constituency 
had recently changed to nearly 60% minority. One colleague commented, "We all 
know that it is primarily white males that have all of the power and the 
financial wherewithal to support sound institutional building." Implicit in his 
logic was that those in power and holding the money would not support 
institutions serving too many people of color. 
</P>
<P>
 The second meeting was of all African American colleagues, who were discussing 
an economic development plan for a program whose client base was rapidly 
changing from African American to Latino. One possible consequence of this 
change would be the diversification of the predominantly African American staff 
and management. The thought of hiring non-African Americans -- particularly in 
key decision-making positions -- was clearly an uncomfortable prospect, judging 
by the looks on the faces of most of the committee members. 
</P>
<P>
 What was particularly telling in both cases was that well-educated 
professionals with good intentions demonstrated that even though there is no 
apartheid in this country, we nevertheless use apartheid-style thinking to 
support the status quo. Rudely put, the bottom line appears to be: We have 
ours; good luck getting yours. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of us have forgotten that one of the legacies of de jure as well as de 
facto segregation has been that ethnic groups develop institutions whose policy 
they can determine and whose activities they can control. Thus, corporate 
elites are reluctant to reinvest in inner cities because they cannot see how 
doing so benefits their primary constituents. Minority entrepreneurs hesitate 
to venture into suburbia, because they cannot see the "ethnic" niche in which 
their institutions have heretofore thrived. 
</P>
<P>
 Few leaders promote an inclusive sense of well-being -- that is, a true 
democratic notion of inclusiveness, participation and power sharing. Los 
Angeles has become the world's most ethnically diverse city, and its 
institutions should have leadership reflective and inclusive of this diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Some community-based groups -- such as the New Majority and the Multicultural 
Collaborative -- have recognized this need. They have begun systematic 
development of coalitions across ethnic groups to influence public policy so 
that economic development will more directly benefit a variety of ethnic 
neighborhoods. The Mega-Cities project is building on these initiatives by 
regularly convening more than 100 community-based leaders of various ethnic 
backgrounds and neighborhoods to share approaches to problem-solving. The 
Irvine Foundation is funding an educational program that provides a four-year 
scholarship to Occidental College for promising diverse high school students -- 
whites included. The belief is that to invest in Los Angeles, you must invest 
in its future leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Corporate leadership in Los Angeles should take the lesson. It would be most 
beneficial if the political and corporate leadership of this city also invested 
in programs designed to train tomorrow's corporate leadership.  
</P>
<P>
 One of the lessons the United States supposedly learned from our foreign 
competitors is that we were failing to invest in human resource development. 
Hopefully we won't make that same mistake here in Los Angeles.  
</P>
<P>
 Limited exposure produces limited thinking and, in the board room, limited 
decision making. The complexity of the problems faced by so diverse a community 
as Los Angeles demands the best thinking from all of us.

IF FREUD HAD BEEN A WOMAN . . . ; MOVING BEYOND WORDS, BY GLORIA STEINEM (SIMON 
& SCHUSTER: $23; 296 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Susan Cheever, Susan Cheever is a novelist and biographer. A Woman's Life, 
her biography of an ordinary woman, was published this month by William Morrow. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "I always trust the microcosm over the macrocosm," writes Gloria Steinem in 
her book of six essays, "Moving Beyong Words." Although on the surface this 
book appears to be a whole book of microcosms -- a couple of essays on money, a 
10-year-old profile of a female body builder, a dissertation on Freudian 
politics -- in fact, the book is part of the intelligent, articulate, witty 
macrocosm that is Gloria Steinem. 
</P>
<P>
 In the way most people you know have devoted their lives to making money, or 
raising their children, Steinem has devoted her life to the principle of 
justice. Her work, whether it's organizing in the boon docks or socializing at 
the Plaza or editing an unknown feminist or writing a best-selling 
auto-biography like "Revolution from Within," is directed toward describing, 
defining and exhorting against the unfair nature of society in all its aspects. 
For Steinem, everything -- from the travails of body builder Bev Francis to the 
writings of John Kenneth Galbraith -- is grist for her high-powered political 
mill. 
</P>
<P>
 She is one of the smartest women of our generation, and one of the most 
persistent. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, whose title is a pun on the word moving (progressing and emoting), 
opens with a hilarious, instructive fantasy: What if Freud had been a woman? 
Steinem loves reversals. "What if a female chief of state had thrown up on the 
Japanese and fainted as President Bush did?" she asks. "What if TV jokes about 
dumb blondes were told about dumb blacks?" and "If men could get pregnant, 
would abortion be a sacrament?" The Freud essay began with a Steinem lecture 
from the 1970s, "What if Men Could Menstruate?" If they could, she 
hypothesizes, men would brag about how long and how much, and sanitary supplies 
would be federally funded. Updated and expanded with footnotes, the new essay 
is an extensive, carefully documented attack on the patriarchal practice of 
psychiatry. "Phyllis Freud never made the fatal error of Karla Marx," explains 
Steinem, "whose interest in historical events created public measures by which 
her theory could be said to succeed or fail." 
</P>
<P>
 The most impressive pieces in the book are the two on economics. "Economics is 
a boring word that clouds our brains and makes us feel like we've hit a brick 
wall," she writes. But as she explains it, "economics" is as close to home as 
your own checkbook: "I began to wonder, what if I were hit by a Mack truck . . 
. how would my checkbook stubs reflect what I cared about?" Arguing that 
spending is a form of self-expression, Steinem notes that of all the charitable 
dollars given in this country every year, less than one percent goes to 
projects specifically for women and girls -- even the Boy Scouts get more than 
the Girl Scouts. In dense, fact-laden, carefully reasoned prose, Steinem 
explains how economics all over the world are controlled by the Census and the 
manipulation of figures for the Gross National and Gross Domestic Products, the 
GDP/GNP. "Most recently, the question has been whether (the Census) methods 
undercount racial minorities, migrants, immigrants, the homeless and other 
groups, whose census invisibility deprives them of economic, social and 
political power." 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Masculinization of Wealth" Steinem shows how rich women are so beaten 
down by society and by both the men in their family and the men who administer 
their family wealth that they often have less power than poor women. "There are 
many ways in which class doesn't work for women -- and some in which it's 
actually reversed," she explains. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a book filled with terrible surprises, a book that takes as its 
starting point the statistic that women do a third of all the paid work in the 
world, and two-thirds of all work, yet get only 10 percent of the world's 
salaries and only one percent of its property. It's a book that explains why 
even wealthy women identify with servants and prostitutes. It's a book that 
spells out the way in which women's magazines relentlessly and shamelessly 
promote the causes of their advertisers -- whether they manufacture cigarettes 
or cosmetics. It's a book that tells us that there is a whole school of 
therapists whose specialty is treating other therapists who have slept with 
their patients and are wrestling with guilt and anxiety. It's a book that 
spells out, over and over, the many different direct and subtle ways in which 
women are reduced to powerlessness in our world. 
</P>
<P>
 In her final essay "Doing Sixty," Steinem writes about herself, about a year 
she spent in India after graduating from college and about her own changes as 
she has aged. "I used to think I would be rewarded for good behavior," she 
writes, in one of many passages I wish could be permanently engraved on my 
brain. "Therefore if I wasn't understood, I must not be understandable; if I 
wasn't successful, I must try harder; if something was wrong, it was my fault. 
More and more I see now that context is all. When someone judges me, anyone or 
anything, I ask: compared to what?" 
</P>
<P>
 In "Revaluing Economics" Steinem quotes Muriel Rukeyser's poem which asks, 
"What would happen if one woman told the truth about her life?/The world would 
split open." Gloria Steinem is one woman who has told the truth about her life 
and ours.

 Rules for dinosaur hunting: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Bring plenty of irradiated chocolate milk boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 2) Remember to bring the guidebook. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Don't forget the sunscreen, hats, first-aid kit and the like. 
</P>
<P>
 4) More chocolate milk. 
</P>
<P>
 5) Brownies are better than trail mix. Especially if you don't bring enough 
chocolate milk. 
</P>
<P>
 This list may save you from being tied to an anthill and left to your fate, an 
end I barely escaped on a recent outing inspired by the "Dinosaur Hunter's Kit" 
(Running Press: $17.95) because I forgot Nos. 2 and 4 from the list above. 
</P>
<P>
 At about a half-mile into a hike on the Eaton Canyon nature trail in Altadena 
on a very warm Saturday afternoon, my hearty band of dino hunters were tired of 
the heat, tired of the dust and really tired of their cheerleading idiot guide 
(who had promised a cold stream and perhaps even a waterfall, not to mention 
deer, bears, Fred Flintstone, John Wayne searching for Natalie Wood, and so on) 
telling them the best stuff was just around the bend. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, I had a rebellion on my hands, so I gathered the troops at a shady 
spot and passed out the first and last round of chocolate milk. And reached for 
the "Dinosaur Hunter's Handbook." 
</P>
<P>
 Which wasn't there, having been left in the car, forgotten in a flurry of 
last-minute booger jokes and karate kicks -- "Just practicing for class, Mr. 
Zimmerman" -- to my shins. 
</P>
<P>
 So I winged it as best I could, dredging up what I could remember from the 
book and supplementing it with bits and pieces of ancient biology texts and 
late-night movies to enlighten, entertain and educate (well, maybe one out of 
three) my young charges, who were quickly refreshed by the shade and sugared 
milk and happy to make fun of my stories and ideas. More important, they were 
ready to venture forth, and in another quarter-mile we found a stream to splash 
around in and build a dam in. 
</P>
<P>
 The long day's journey was salvaged (the forgotten round of chocolate milk 
replaced with a stop at In 'n' Out Burger for sodas and fries on the way home) 
but the mission was far from accomplished. The little handbook was definitely 
missed; the chapters on what paleontologists do, how dinosaurs get their names 
and a mock fossil hunter's notebook convey a fair amount of useful information 
in 64 small pages. 
</P>
<P>
 It was getting late and I had kids to deliver, so I saved the "kit" part for 
later in the week, when my son would have time to dig up his own apatosaurus. 
</P>
<P>
 The kit, in fact, is a "replica of an apatosaurus skeleton buried in hard, 
slate-like layers and covered with clay-like rock similar to the soft rocks 
where real fossils are found." It comes with a "wooden spatula" (actually a 
Popsicle stick) to scrape away the rock (actually hard clay); you'll also need 
water, paper towels, a toothbrush and the like. The last chapter in the 
guidebook contained the detailed instructions we needed to get us through our 
"dig," which turned out remarkably well considering that I'm all thumbs and 
tend to break models into many pieces. The instructions include space for 
drawing and writing about the work by the young dino hunter, including tips for 
adult "lab assistants." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the real thing, our fossil dig was agreeably messy and lots of fun. It 
kept us occupied for some hours spread out over a few days -- digging the 
fossil, baking it dry in the oven, gluing the pieces together, painting it and 
so on, all the while keeping a log in the back of the handbook. And we have a 
nice-sized ball of clay hardening on the patio for a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Be Your Own Map Expert" by Barbara Taylor (Sterling Publishing: $12.95) 
would have been useful on our wilderness venture and is an excellent activity 
book in its own right. Pretty near everything about maps and map-making is 
covered with superb graphics and well-written information. The activities range 
from designing map symbols to creating a treasure hunt game. My schoolmarm wife 
took one look and in short order made plans for a week's worth of lessons for 
next semester.

 THE FAVOURITE by Meredith Daneman (Knopf: $19; 163 pp.) There's a new 
character in Frank's comic strip, the one about his family, and straight away 
Rosalind knows.She doesn't know she knows, but she knows. Wives always do. 
Frank is having an affair. Not that Rosalind is innocent of affairs. She grew 
up with them, back in Australia. Her father had them as regularly as a six-day 
clock; move out, then move back in. And now Frank. "It happens to everyone," 
Rosalind tells herself. "It is life, for heaven's sake, nothing personal. 
Except that it is personal, now that it's happened to me. That is the trick of 
it: It happens every time for the first time; the blood and the astonishment 
are undimmed." 
</P>
<P>
 There is an attempted suicide in "The Favourite," and one that succeeds, and 
men -- lanky, charming, handsome, engagingly helpless -- are forever letting 
their women down, and their children. It is a wrenching book at times, 
beautifully done, and if you're a man you should hang your head for even 
thinking about adultery. But "The Favourite" is no tear-jerker. Meredith 
Daneman has a way of setting scenes that leave you midway between a smile and a 
tear; a perception gentle and sardonic by turns. On her mother: "It's not that 
she's so beautiful. It's just that for me her face is the original, the one on 
which my idea of faces is based." 
</P>
<P>
 The ending is full of surprises, coming full circle and then some, in a novel 
that's short, but far from slight.

 LESSONS IN SURVIVAL by Laramie Dunaway (Warner: $19.95; 424 pp.) It's like 
eating chocolate truffles. A lot of them. For breakfast. Laramie Dunaway is 
clever, witty, mordant, ripe with repartee and riposte. So are her characters: 
The prodigy, the principal, the producer, the teller, the cop on the beat, all 
emit epigrams like B.O. In the middle of sex: "I'm trying not to think." "How 
do you do that?" "Become a Republican." While fleeing the police in a tense 
scene: "Don't make fun of lepers." "Sorry . . . the dermatologically 
disadvantaged." Four hundred pages of when sally met parry. It gets crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which detours attention around a bang-up story, full of acute 
commentary on the human condition of the '90s whenever Dunaway stops to inhale. 
The plot thickens on Page 1, with Blue Erhart hounded by the tabloids at the 
school where she teaches biology (in a style vivid enough to rate a book by 
itself). After 20 years in the slammer, her bank-robber parents -- "kind of a 
hippie version of Bonnie and Clyde" with unloaded shotguns, who'd mailed their 
withdrawals to worthy causes -- are being released. The doting parents had 
brought 10-year-old Blue along on the heists, presumably on the theory that the 
family that preys together stays together. Blue remains resentful, especially 
of Mom, who'd declined parole 10 years earlier in a gesture of solidarity with 
Dad. Free at last, Blue's folks, bored, rob a bank two days later. Blue, 
burdened, pursued by movie deals, decamps for the Bend, an Arizona retreat 
where there are no rules, no messages, just a casual messiah called Thomas Q -- 
whose perfection is underscored by his opinion of Grandpa Walton: "I never did 
trust him. He had a weird look in his eye, like he had some very racy magazines 
stuffed under his mattress." And this is just a sample. 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone gets together, more or less, Blue ending up with a wanna-be producer, 
to whom she has the gall to say: "Can't you just speak to me? No clever patter, 
no snappy dialogue." Jeez.

 GALILEO: A Life by James Reston Jr. (HarperCollins: $25; 288 pp.) "Galileo 
guffawed," writes James Reston Jr. in this muscular new biography, and such is 
Reston's command that you can hear the snort. And see the snorter, this unruly 
Renaissance genius, lusty, disheveled, obstreperous, arrogant, "his large frame 
lumbering forward and his red hair flowing, ready to stop and argue almost any 
proposition as if it were an invitation to a fight." In a spirited evocation of 
Galileo's charisma and capacity, Reston traces his galactic collision course 
with the only power on earth or heaven able to bring him to his knees: the 
Roman Catholic Church. For Galileo was, above all, a believer, his logic ever 
at odds with illogical faith. (In his famed lecture before the Academy of 
Florence, Galileo, in all seriousness, limned the appearance and dimensions of 
Dante's hell). The church was the law in those days, and more: a dictatorship 
empowered not only to excommunicate but also to torture and, in extremis, put 
out contracts -- on Lutherans, heretics and mad scientists claiming that the 
earth, biblical center of the universe (Joshua, Ecclesiastes, Solomon, etc.), 
revolved about the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a mighty struggle, one that the "winner" has yet to live down (its 
lukewarm 1992 acknowledgment that "errors were made" notwithstanding). Forced 
to deny what he could see in the sky was the polymath for whom Renaissance man 
was coined. Somewhat better rounded than today's version -- someone who can 
simultaneously cough and watch "Coach" -- Galileo had mastered and amplified 
math, astronomy, physics and medicine by his mid-20s; invented the telescope, 
thermometer, compass and a theoretical telephone; excelled at, and composed 
for, the lute; gardened with great skill; translated epics from the Greek to 
amuse himself; taken on -- and whipped -- not only Ptolemy but also Aristotle. 
He lost to the almighty church, of course, but only by split decision, a 
contest of which Reston's account is fresh, sinewy and altogether admirable.

 SO FAR, SO GOOD: A Memoir by Burgess Meredith (Little, Brown: $22.95; 288 pp.) 
Burgess Meredith may have waited a heartbeat too long. He's been busy. That's 
good, for those who appreciate a solid performance: To this day, Meredith has 
never, ever disappointed. That's not so good for his biography, which is 
inclined to ramble, to peter out. Of course, Meredith's peter is a lesser man's 
pizazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith is 83, or 85, or something like that (you know how actors are). 
Started acting in the late '20s, and never stopped. Knew everybody, worked with 
most, slept with not a few (Tallulah Bankhead; the heavenly Hedy Lamarr; 
Marlene Dietrich; Ingrid Bergman, most likely; and others still breathing, thus 
exempt from a gentleman's memoirs). "God knows I was not a dashing swain," he 
writes, "but in a kind of mongrel way I chased the foxes." Raised hell with 
roomie Jimmy Stewart. Hunted for sunken treasure with John Steinbeck. Married 
Paulette Goddard, after Charlie Chaplin, before Erich Maria Remarque. Smoked 
opium and recited Joyce with James Mason in a Hong Kong hotel room. Cruised the 
Sea of Cortez with John Huston looking for the meaning of life. Made Joe 
McCarthy's "red channel" list -- and won an Emmy for playing Joseph Welsh in 
"Tail Gunner Joe." Schmoozed under the stars with Harry Hopkins on the lawn of 
Roosevelt's White House (Franklin, not Teddy). As an Air Corps officer, 
persuaded Cole Porter to write a song for the Glider Division. (" 'Glide, 
glider, glide, for Christ's sake,' said the general. 'You don't want me to take 
that to the guys, do you?' ") 
</P>
<P>
 They're here, all of them, Katherine Cornell to Sly Stallone, James Baldwin, 
Orson Welles, Aldous Huxley, Ernie Pyle, Henry Fonda, Gorgeous Gussie, Brecht 
and Weill and Lenya; Brando and Thurber; Zero Mostel learning to walk like a 
geisha; agnostic Charles Laughton reading the Bible over the radio. There are 
also snippets of wisdom on acting, directing -- living -- and all sorts of 
meandering fun, and one can only marvel at what the old actor must have 
forgotten. Still, the next time he says, "I remember the time that . . . " 
prick up your ears. It's bound to be choice.

 A COMMON LIFE: Four Generations of American Literary Friendship and Influence 
by David Larkin (Simon & Schuster: $25; 512 pp.) A breathless tour of America's 
literary landscape by way of its promontories, "A Common Life" succeeds as a 
text, a lively doctoral thesis, but will probably lose some casual travelers 
along the way.David Larkin deftly, if arbitrarily, pairs eight of our giants, 
generation by overlapping generation -- Hawthorne-Melville, Henry James-Edith 
Wharton, Porter-Welty, Elizabeth Bishop-Robert Lowell -- and examines the 
influence each had on the other's oeuvre, and on succeeding pairs. Wildly 
opposite in temperament, each "a solitary who could not live alone," they 
developed friendships based initially on mutual admiration (though James could 
never quite get the hang of Wharton's work, calling one of her best stories "a 
masterly little achievement," emphasis on little).  
</P>
<P>
 Puritanical Hawthorne ("not an enjoying person") fed off Melville's "heated 
devotion . . . just a whisker shy of the erotic." Hawthorne's dark depth in 
turn affected the hitherto accessible Melville, notably in "Moby Dick" (one can 
only imagine the original: "Call me Ishmael. I'll be your waiter tonight."). 
James, to Wharton, was "a trophy she desperately wanted to carry off." For his 
part, Gentleman James wanted to "pump the pure essence of my wisdom and 
experience into her." Flamboyant, restless, self-centered Porter, who "thanked 
God for making her beautiful," gave plain, sweet, modest Welty an indispensable 
leg up, professionally, simply because she recognized Welty's towering gift for 
fiction. Charming, brilliant, Boston-aristocratic, poet Lowell, aggressively 
heterosexual and periodically mad, remained friends for 40 years with 
obsessively reticent, lesbian poet Bishop, in spite of her visceral dislike of 
his "confessional poetry." 
</P>
<P>
 It would help to have read everything all eight have written. But if you're 
game, you'll find "A Common Life" stimulating.

 THE OLD MAN WHO READ LOVE STORIES by Luis Sepulveda, translated from the 
Spanish by Peter Bush (Harcourt Brace: $14.95; 144 pp.) The dentist comes 
upriver twice a year to pull the natives' teeth. On one visit, the Old Man 
tallies extractions. "Do you always keep count?" asks the dentist. "That's what 
friends are for," says the Old Man. He knows things: How to catch monkeys with 
hollow coconuts, how to keep piranhas at bay by rubbing his body with sap, how 
to milk snake venom to sell to the labs. He knows, too, that the native wife of 
the slimy village mayor will kill him: "She's piling up hatred but hasn't got 
enough yet. These things take time." Some Old Man, this Old Man. Shrewder, and 
funnier, than Hemingway's version; more accommodating than Ahab. Like the 
others, uncommonly courageous; unlike them, unremittingly endearing. 
</P>
<P>
 This Old Man has come down from the highlands of Ecuador, responding to hollow 
promises of government help in settling the jungle state of Amazonia. He brings 
his bride to the haphazard, virgin village called El Idilio. Nothing grows on 
their "farm." His bride dies. The Old Man melts into the jungle, where he is 
adopted by a tribe of eccentric hunters who send him off periodically, just for 
the sheer joy of welcoming him back. 
</P>
<P>
 He is wryly magnificent, this Old Man, this memorable creation of Luis 
Sepulveda, but he has a vice: He reads. Word by word, sometimes letter by 
letter, but he reads, and it is his great comfort there in the jungle, "the 
antidote to the deadly poison of old age." The dentist brings him two books 
every six months. The Old Man wants stories of "suffering, hopeless loves and 
happy endings." The dentist gets them from a conscientious black whore, who 
"alternated her duties as female companion with those of literary critic." 
</P>
<P>
 There is a plot, pitting the brave Old Man against a bereft, marauding ocelot, 
but mostly there are the beloved books, sentence by sentence, word by word, and 
the Old Man. You will love him.

WHILE WE WALTZ OFF ON BOOK TOUR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Alice Hoffman

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At long last, I was persuaded by those I trust most at the publishing house 
that has stood by me for 15 years that real writers tour. Everyone tours, 
illustrious authors and first-time novelists, egomaniacs and homebodies. As far 
as I could tell, the book tour I had always refused any part of didn't really 
have a downside. No one would miss me for a few weeks, of this I was assured. 
My children would be in good hands. My dogs would howl at the back door for an 
hour or so, until time took on canine proportions. I wouldn't have to answer 
phone calls or respond to bills. Instead, I would be visiting some of the best 
bookstores in the country. I would be staying at wonderful hotels, in rooms 
with views and Jacuzzis and maids to turn down the bed. I would wear something 
other than jeans and sweat shirts. I would drink wine, be with adults, buy a 
silk blouse and a stack of magazines to read on the plane. I would talk about 
myself, often and at great length. 
</P>
<P>
 I said yes. I admit it. And once I had begun, it took only a single afternoon 
for me to understand why everyone was going on the road: Touring is easier than 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 It goes something like this: You fly to Chicago -- or Minneapolis or Detroit 
-- and are met at the airport by a literary escort who knows books as well as 
the town. Without fuss, your luggage is retrieved and you're driven to a 
terrific hotel, where you can order room service and have your clothes pressed, 
which you would never bother with at home. Clearly, a writer could get used to 
such a routine. There is something completely unwriterly about touring, so 
public and social and amazingly unlike sitting in one's attic all day with a 
hot computer and a cold cup of tea, trying to get the scent of violets or the 
sound of a horse drinking cool water onto the page. It was so effortless to 
live this life, so extremely pleasant, that I might have enjoyed it had I not 
felt, from the very start of my tour, that something was not right. When I 
phoned home, all was well, yet I continued to wake at odd hours. I felt guilty 
and out of sorts, as though I had wronged someone. I could feel betrayal on my 
skin. 
</P>
<P>
 Three thousand miles away, in the attic of my house, beneath a slanting 
ceiling, uncomfortably scrunched onto the white wicker couch -- which was 
already piled high with books and manuscripts and unanswered mail -- was a man 
who hadn't bothered to clean the mud off his boots. He had always been 
difficult -- anyone who knew him knew that much -- but now that he was left to 
his own devices, he had become downright surly. The woman seated beside him 
hadn't eaten or slept since I had gone away; she was growing as pale as the 
white wicker, and her mouth was set in an angry line. For one thing, she wasn't 
talking to the man next to her, and wouldn't be for another 50 pages -- pages, 
she continually reminded me, I had not yet written because I was on tour. 
</P>
<P>
 So there they were, furious at each other for all that had happened years 
earlier, drawn to each other more than ever, and yet unable to speak because 
they were not yet on the same page. To make matters worse, beside the woman was 
her teen-age daughter, who had been chewing the same piece of bubble gum for 
all the days I'd been away, blowing bubbles, then popping them, driving the 
others mad. This girl has good reason to be annoyed at her lack of control 
inside and outside fiction -- her age and name and hair color may all change at 
the author's whim -- but, no matter how many times she is revised, certain 
elements will remain unaltered, a core or essence or -- if you will allow this 
to a character -- a soul around which all else is built. For instance, this 
girl will never want to be in the same room with her mother and this man, let 
alone be trapped there for the duration of my tour. She will always stick out 
her tongue and make rude noises when anyone -- this writer, for instance -- 
asks why she is drawing on the clean white office wall with a tube of cheap 
drugstore lipstick. 
</P>
<P>
 It is clear that two weeks spent together on the couch rather than on the page 
does not bring out the best in one's characters. Given this sort of time, they 
begin to ask questions. What is their motivation? Whom do they love? If the 
writer should dare to prolong the tour, her characters may start to wonder if 
it would help matters for them to know how it all turns out in the end. Well, 
knowing how it all turns out on the page is not unlike carrying around the 
exact moment and circumstance of one's own death. Once granted that piece of 
news, why would a character go on? Why would a novelist continue? That I have 
no idea of where we are headed is not information I'm about to reveal to my 
characters, at least not in my absence, since they seem convinced that they 
know exactly who they are and are taking up more and more space every day. 
</P>
<P>
 Another storm is moving in across my home state. I take the new silk blouse 
from my suitcase, then travel down to a bookstore to meet my readers. As I look 
out the window of the limo, I think about how it is true not only that my 
characters do not exist without me, but also that I do not exist without them. 
Without them, I am simply a woman in a hotel room. With them, I'm a writer, one 
in a desperate hurry to get home to whoever's waiting. Alice Hoffman

 TALK: NPR's Susan Stamberg Considers All Things by Susan Stamberg (Perigee: 
$15; 384 pp.). The first woman to anchor a nightly news show, Stamberg offers 
comments and excerpts from more than two decades of interviews.Her subjects 
range from Rosa Parks, who explains her decision to challenge the segregated 
Montgomery bus system with quiet dignity, to Ethel Merman, who clearly grows 
annoyed at Stamberg's questions. Harold Stassen's earnest commitment to aiding 
humanity will chasten anyone who's joked about his perennial campaign for the 
presidency: It contrasts starkly with John Ehrlichman's icy lack of repentance 
for his efforts to obstruct justice. Fans of "All Things Considered" will 
recognize many of these stories (including Stamberg's dubious recipe for 
cranberry relish); others will find an engaging introduction to one of the most 
intelligent news programs in America.

 WAVES: An Anthology of New Gay Fiction edited by Ethan Mordden (Vintage: $12; 
249 pp.; paperback original). In his clever introduction, Mordden attempts to 
classify the rapidly expanding genre of gay fiction.He notes that these 
divisions are often bridged by "a feeling that gay writers are recording and 
analyzing their lives because, if they didn't, no one would know that they had 
been here, including themselves." The stories in the anthology vary widely in 
quality. In "Forty Wild Crushes," Jim Provenzano uses outrageous footnotes to 
recount a life of longing; Richard Davis juxtaposes bitter childhood vignettes 
with the life of an adult Afro-American man in "Marty." But Rex Knight's 
effortfully erotic "The Number You Have Reached" reads like a reject from a 
skin magazine, and Mordden's "The Hunt for Red October" displays his usual 
polish, but lacks the incisive content of the other stories in his "Buddies" 
series.

 FOSSILS: Evidence of Vanished Worlds by Yvette Gayrard-Valy (Abrams: $12.95; 
192 pp., illustrated, paperback original). A curator at the National Museum of 
Natural History in Paris, Gayrard-Valy traces Western attitudes about fossils 
and their meaning. The significance of seashells found on mountain tops and 
immense bones intrigued scientists and philosophers for centuries. During the 
Renaissance, European savants began the studies that would replace the Biblical 
history of the Earth with the theories that form the basis of modern biology, 
geology and paleontology, including a vastly increased time-scale, continental 
drift and the ongoing evolution of new species. The illustrations include 
reproductions of old manuscripts depicting past visions of the Earth's origins.

 BLACK VELVET: The Art We Love to Hate by Jennifer Heath (Pomegranate Artbooks: 
$17.95; 95 pp., paperback original). Heath's attempt to present painting on 
velvet as "truly cross cultural, transcending place and social identity. . . . 
At its best, it is a heroic, epic art form that expresses sociomythic concerns 
and ethnic pride" is undercut by the sheer awfulness of the illustrations. The 
clumsy draftsmanship, garish palette and trite subjects of these often 
mass-produced images suggest the artistic equivalent of a pratt fall. 
Hilarious, but hardly heroic.

 THE SEWING ROOM by Barbara Cawthorne Crafton (Penguin: $12.99; 253 pp.). One 
of the first women to be ordained into the Episcopal priesthood, Crafton offers 
her reflections on the joys and frustrations of her pastoral duties.In her 
efforts to care for the homeless in New York, she learns that chemical 
dependency and mental illness often thwart the best intentions of both 
care-givers and patients. A cheerful account of a Christmas service for foreign 
sailors takes a chilling turn when many of the men who attended are lost in a 
storm. It's easy to understand how the resistance some parishioners felt toward 
the idea of a female priest soon gave way to acceptance: Even on the printed 
page, Crafton exhibits an almost palpable charm.

 VOYAGE IN THE DARK by Jean Rhys (Norton: $6.95; 188 pp.) . This acclaimed 
novel follows the efflorescence and decline of Anna Morgan, a young woman on 
the brink of adulthood. An emigrant from the West Indies adrift in Great 
Britain, Anna becomes a dancer in minor revues. Briefly taken up by a wealthy 
man, she is unable to accept his failure to return her devotion. In bleak, 
spare prose, Rhys captures the loneliness of a woman who has given everything 
she had and been spurned: Anna's tragedy is not a fantasy of sorrowful passion, 
but a realistic succession of slow hours that must be filled with the 
meaningless activities of daily life.

 THINGS I SHOULD HAVE SAID TO MY FATHER compiled by Joanna Powell (Avon: $10; 
129 pp., paperback original). Mother's Day spawns an unremitting stream of 
mush; Father's Day evokes more complex and often conflicting emotions. In these 
interviews and quotes, various figures in the arts and popular culture express 
pride, joy, anger, affection, dissatisfaction and unfulfilled longings for 
closeness. Sam Shepard sets the tone for the collection when he describes how 
he sees his father in himself: " . . . WHAM, there's my old man. Right there, 
living inside me like a worm in the wood."

 TARGET EL TORO: A sensitive task awaits county supervisors Tuesday: Approving 
a Nov. 8 ballot initiative on whether the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station 
should be converted to a commercial airport. Supporters have gathered more than 
the needed signatures to qualify. . . . But that doesn't make it any easier for 
Board Chairman Thomas F. Riley, who opposes placing an airport there. But, says 
Riley: "With all the signatures, I don't think we have a choice."

 DEATH AT DAWN: The county is stockpiling insecticides to prepare for the 
arrival of the Africanized honeybee, better known as the "killer bee." But 
Vector Control officials say the most "deadly" form of spray has proven to be 
Dawn liquid dish soap. . . . The sticky, blue grease-fighting substance clogs 
the bee's respiratory system, bringing certain death. The downside: Vector 
Control can't use Dawn -- it hasn't been approved as an insecticide.

 DOCTOR DAD: Bradford Silveira, 36, says it wasn't his father, Dr. Roderick 
Silveira, 62, who pressured him to become a doctor. So how come both doctors 
are radiologists at St. Jude Medical Center in Fullerton? "My father's 
influence was by example and his enthusiasm for the work," says the son. . . . 
They plan to celebrate Father's Day today by not talking about the office. The 
younger Silveira says at first he had some apprehension about working alongside 
his father: "But it's really turned out great."

 SCHOOL SHOPPING: Sandra and David Slon of Beverly Hills have compiled a 
directory of Orange County's 475 public schools to help parents choose the best 
education for their children under the state's new open enrollment plan. . . . 
"You'd consult Consumer Reports if you were buying a $300 clothes dryer," 
reasons Sandra Slon, an attorney. "Why not consult a 'buying guide' before 
investing 12 years of your child's life?" The guide ($29.95) ranks the schools 
by standardized test scores, and lists their special programs.

DRIVE TO BRING WORLD CUP TO U.S. BEGAN ON FATEFUL DAY IN '84 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 For all intents and purposes, the World Cup Soccer Tournament started coming 
to America sometime in the early afternoon of Thursday, Aug. 9, 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Rothenberg, the man who would eventually lead the effort to get the World 
Cup here, and who is now the CEO of World Cup USA, was in a quandary that day. 
He was the soccer commissioner for the '84 Olympics, and he had been looking 
forward to a calm before the storm of the soccer final two nights later at the 
Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 All he had on his plate that day was the third-place game, matching Yugoslavia 
and Italy. The Rose Bowl then held about 100,000 for soccer and Rothenberg and 
his crew expected half that for the consolation game. Being American, he knew 
how U.S. sports fans reacted to games that were for something other than the 
championship. They ignored them. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after noon, he received word that the Rose Bowl parking lots were 
swarming with people lining up to buy tickets for that night's game. And there 
was nowhere near enough tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg and his associates, fearing a riot, had additional tickets rushed 
in. That night, Yugoslavia beat Italy, 2-1, in front of 100,374 people. And the 
rest of the world, especially those who pay close attention to soccer, couldn't 
help but notice. 
</P>
<P>
 The seed had been planted. Maybe soccer could come to the richest country in 
the world for its quadrennial showcase. 
</P>
<P>
 Between that day in August, 1984, and 1989, much was happening behind the 
scenes on the international level. But Rothenberg knew he needed to make a move 
on the national level. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Soccer Federation, to most observers, lacked the sophistication to 
pull off the hosting of a World Cup. It was a disjointed organization that was 
still raising some funds with bake sales. 
</P>
<P>
 As the time for election of the head of the U.S. Soccer Federation neared, 
Rothenberg moved in with a well-organized campaign befitting the well-respected 
Los Angeles lawyer. In 1990, he was elected president and all who followed his 
quick ascent understood that, not only would the World Cup in the United States 
take on the organizational attributes of the L.A. Olympic Organizing 
Committeebut that he would expertly maneuver his hometowninto the central role. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 17, the World Cup finals will be played at the Rose Bowl. It will be 
just 23 days shy of 10 years since 100,374 fans shocked Rothenberg and showed 
the world this might be a good place for a soccer tournament after all.

CLINTON PUSHES FOR CRIME BILL PASSAGE, DEFENDS WELFARE REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Urging Congress to finish work on the crime bill, President Clinton said guns, 
drugs, gangs and crime are sapping the unity of Americans and threatening to 
blight the nation's future. 
</P>
<P>
 "No issue poses the need to come together more to deal with the problems we 
face than does the cancer of crime and violence that is eating away at the 
bonds that unite us as a people," the President said in his weekly radio 
address, broadcast Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also said that the welfare reform plan he offered last week "will 
encourage personal responsibility and help strengthen our families through 
tougher child support, more education and training, and an absolute requirement 
to go to work after a period of time." 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans, in a response delivered by Sen. Lauch Faircloth of North 
Carolina, attacked the plan as defending the current welfare system. Faircloth 
called its work provisions "a total sham" and said that overall it is "wrong 
for America." 
</P>
<P>
 The President recorded his remarks in Chicago on Friday after visiting the 
Robert Taylor Homes, a housing project overrun by gangs and crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went there because it's a good place to emphasize to all Americans that we 
have begun a nationwide effort to drive the guns, the gangs and the drugs from 
public housing and from all neighborhoods where Americans feel terrorized," 
Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview that was published Saturday in the Chicago Sun-Times, Clinton 
endorsed a $2.8-billion plan to replace Chicago's public housing complexes with 
mixed-income developments that would be scattered throughout the city and 
suburbs. 
</P>
<P>
 The President was spending the Fathers' Day weekend at Camp David with his 
wife and daughter.

THE POND MAKES A BIG SPLASH IN ITS FIRST YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 From Manilow and Streisand to Ducks and Bullfrogs, The Pond of Anaheim has 
played host to about 180 events for nearly 2 million people in its first year 
of operation, exceeding the expectations of city and community officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been an incredible year," said Brad Mayne, the arena's general manager. 
"We've had a couple of parking snafus and other kinks to work out, but that's 
to be expected. . . . We've been very pleased with what's happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Today marks the one-year anniversary of the arena's first act: Barry Manilow 
sang to a sold-out crowd, but his performance was overshadowed by a serious 
parking shortage around the facility that left many concert-goers stuck in 
traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Much has changed since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, most of the parking woes are solved and the headliners, not frustrated 
motorists, get all the publicity. 
</P>
<P>
 The facility is expected to top more than $25 million in revenue this year -- 
about $2 million below the $27-million operating and debt service costs. Still, 
the revenues are more than officials had anticipated for the first year of 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "This exceeds all our projections," Mayne said. "We've had really good cash 
flow." 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought we'd be so close to breaking even so soon," said Councilman 
Bob D. Simpson, who was city manager when Anaheim embarked on the project. "I 
think this is one of the better moves we've ever made." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, there were plenty of people who had predicted doom for the 
$121-million arena, which was derisively called a "boondoggle" and "white 
elephant." They said it would stand empty and become a monument to a municipal 
gamble that didn't pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like they were wrong," Simpson said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, most of the public's concern centered on the financial 
arrangement that the city worked out with the Ogden Corp., its partner in the 
arena project. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that partnership, the city supplied the land and Ogden built the arena. 
In exchange for footing the construction bill, Ogden received a 30-year 
contract to operate the facility. The arrangement, however, also made the city 
liable for as much as $2 million annually for up to eight years, if neither a 
professional hockey nor basketball franchise became a tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Public perception changed dramatically in December, 1992, when the Walt Disney 
Co. announced it was bringing a National Hockey League expansion team, called 
the Mighty Ducks, into the facility. During the negotiations for the team's 
lease, the city managed to reduce its financial liability to a maximum of $7.5 
million if a basketball team is not a tenant during the fourth through eighth 
year of the arena's operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Most city officials, however, are optimistic that the city will never have to 
pay a dime. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just look at the success of the Ducks," Simpson said. "This is a great sports 
market." 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks, more than anything else, helped transformed the arena into a 
successful sporting and entertainment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, we've ridden on the coattails of the Ducks' success," said Mayne. 
"The Ducks created an excitement around here that everyone wanted to be part 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance statistics and merchandise sales prove it. The Ducks had 27 
sellouts and averaged 16,979 fans per game in the 17,174-seat facility. Ducks 
merchandise outsold merchandise for all professional teams in every 
professional league. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Robertson, a spokesman for the Ducks organization, said the team expects 
to sell out all of its games next year. 
</P>
<P>
 But city and arena officials are quick to say that The Pond of Anaheim is more 
than just a hockey facility.  
</P>
<P>
 "The variety of events we've had has been great," Mayor Tom Daly said. 
</P>
<P>
 Music concerts have been among the most successful events. In fact, a couple 
of trade magazines voted The Pond the best new concert venue, attracting such 
top performers as Barbra Streisand, Billy Joel, Clint Black and Manilow. 
</P>
<P>
 There also have been circuses, rodeos, church revivals, figure skating shows 
and motor cross races. And although the Ducks are the most popular tenants, The 
Pond is also home to the Bullfrogs roller hockey team and the Splash, an indoor 
soccer team. 
</P>
<P>
 Still apparently years away, though, is one of the most desired sports 
attractions -- a National Basketball Assn. franchise. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is one of our top priorities," Mayne said, even though he admits that 
such a franchise may be at least three years away. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, The Pond will be the part-time home for the Los Angeles 
Clippers, who will play seven games in Anaheim next season. The Clippers played 
two games in Anaheim last year, once in the preseason and then again in January 
when the Northridge earthquake temporarily closed the Los Angeles Sports Arena. 
Both were heavily attended. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking to showcase the building to the NBA with the Clippers this 
year," Mayne said. The Clippers, on the other hand, will be trying to attract 
fan support in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a mutually beneficial arrangement," Mayne said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly said it won't be long before the NBA finds a home in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the potential departure of the Los Angeles Rams, "Anaheim is at the 
heart of one of the top sports markets in the U.S.," Daly said. "The huge 
success of the arena verifies and confirms this. I think the NBA will come in 
here eventually. It's just a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to an NBA team, Mayne said arena officials are trying to lure 
collegiate playoff games, as well as Olympic and other world-class events into 
the building.  
</P>
<P>
 "We deserve those types of events here," he said. "This is a state-of-the-art 
facility. . . . It's a secure area and a great place to bring the family."

 Give us attentive teachers. Challenge us more. Bring on more counselors 
because our lives are more messed up than you think. Take us out of the dark 
ages in math and science. Above all, listen to us. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the blunt, ground-zero advice that members of the Class of 1994 have 
for the Los Angeles Unified School District. Before nearly 27,000 graduates 
stepped off the platform last week, The Times asked eight of them to reflect, 
in their own words, on the highs and lows of their education. 
</P>
<P>
 Excerpts of the discussions follow. Making things better, the graduates 
conclude, has little to do with school district politics, and everything to do 
with what goes on inside their classrooms. SYLMAR HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Clifford and Armando Alvarez, both 18, say their experience in public 
school has been just all right. But each leaves Sylmar High School with a 
vibrant memory -- one class with a demanding, challenging teacher.  
</P>
<P>
 Clifford plans to attend community college. Alvarez is looking into vocational 
school or the military.  
</P>
<P>

<P>
 JENNIFER CLIFFORD: A lot of people drop out because they are bored of school. 
I'm one of the ones who made it.  
</P>
<P>
 My education could have been better. I feel that the teachers and counselors 
need to push you more. Most students don't set goals. And if they don't set 
goals, then they are not going to stay in school. What's the use of staying in 
school if you have nothing for the future? 
</P>
<P>
 When I was in 10th and 11th grade I was in this program called Humanitas and 
the students really got involved. The teachers were all good and worked with 
the students. 
</P>
<P>
 We had four classes -- science, history, English and humanities -- and all the 
classes studied one theme. The theme that I most remembered was learning about 
the atomic bomb. We learned history by studying the world wars. We studied how 
the bomb was made and learned science. Then we made a video and were graded on 
our presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 Education like that is exciting. It's very rare to have classes like that. I 
mean, you're lucky if you get a class like that. Most people I know say 'I want 
to get out of here. I want to get out of the class.' In other classes you just 
sit there, and you're bored just looking at the board.  
</P>
<P>
 I found 10th and 11th grade were my best years in school. 
</P>
<P>
 But they dropped the humanities class in the 11th grade. For the rest of the 
semester I went into a typing class. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't hard for me to stay in school. I set goals when I was in ninth 
grade. My mom's a nurse, and my grandma's a nurse, so I just decided to follow 
in their footsteps. I'm going to the College of the Canyons for two years for 
my associate degree, and then go into nursing.  
</P>
<P>
 I like it a lot when teachers talk to you individually. Because when they just 
lecture to the whole class, and they don't talk to you personally, it seems 
they just want to get the work done so they can go home.  
</P>
<P>
 They just go straight from the book, they use questions from the book, they 
don't give good examples. I think teachers should express themselves more in 
class, let us know what they think instead of just going from the book. 
</P>
<P>
 I know that teachers are demoralized because their pay is low. But some care 
more about their paychecks than us. 
</P>
<P>
 Our school doesn't have much money, either. We don't get to take books home to 
study. We have to do it all in class. That means we're being rushed to do our 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 In one economics class, we had to skip chapters because there wasn't enough 
time to explain the whole book. Since we couldn't read chapters at home, 
everything had to be done in the class period. 
</P>
<P>
 I think about all the things that you didn't learn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ARMANDO ALVAREZ: What I remember most from elementary school is a science 
fair. I won first prize 
</P>
<P>
 I can't remember the project now -- but I was in fourth grade and my picture 
came out in the newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 It got me thinking that I was good in science at a young age. 
</P>
<P>
 I agree with Jennifer that we need new books, but education depends on 
students, too. Do they want a great education or do they just want an OK 
education? If they really want a great education they'll put all their effort 
into the work in all their classes. 
</P>
<P>
 I could have had a great education if I would have studied more and just paid 
more attention. 
</P>
<P>
 One friend of mine dropped out last month. He just really didn't care that 
much anymore. He just stopped going to classes. He'd been ditching a lot. And 
he just decided to stay home. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers also make a difference. Some of them really want to help you. But 
some don't put any effort into their explanations and lots of students just 
fall asleep. Some teachers just stand there and talk through the whole hour. 
</P>
<P>
 I like teachers who talk to you and use their hands, show you examples. They 
are the ones who make learning better for us. They ask you questions. They make 
you think. 
</P>
<P>
 In our government class, we were having a mock trial. We are the lawyers, the 
plaintiffs, the jury, everything. I liked it because we're playing parts in a 
case about kids who wrote in their school newspaper. It was about the First 
Amendment. The whole class got involved in it. 
</P>
<P>
 The one thing that messed us up was the earthquake. We didn't come to school 
for about two weeks. And we never got to finish the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way, a lot of teachers just won't open (up) to us. I guess it's hard for 
them because every class has more than 30 students. And they each have five 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Education is not like it used to be. I remember in elementary school and 
junior high we were able to take field trips to museums so we could learn more. 
Nowadays we really can't. 
</P>
<P>
 In a way I'm kind of scared to leave school. I've been in school in the same 
neighborhood for 13 years, since kindergarten.

'CHAPLAIN OF THE 'HOOD' IS SLAIN, DEPUTY HURT; VIOLENCE: BRUCE BRYAN OFTEN 
ACCOMPANIED SHERIFF'S OFFICERS, CONSOLING CRIME VICTIMS AND CALMING SUSPECTS, 
BUT HIS LAST RIDE ENDS IN TRAGEDY. SUSPECT IN BOTH SHOOTINGS IS IN CUSTODY.

<P>
 They called Bruce Bryan "the chaplain of the 'hood." 
</P>
<P>
 Not just because of the tough Carson streets where he routinely rode along 
with sheriff's deputies, but because of the volunteer chaplain's habit of 
helping people in trouble with the law even as they leaned handcuffed against 
patrol cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Saturday, one of those troubled people turned on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said Bryan, 39, was gunned down execution-style on a 
lonely Wilmington street by a man also suspected of shooting and critically 
wounding Sheriff's Deputy Terrence Wenger, 31, during a ride-along gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators said the incident occurred about 2:45 a.m. in the 100 block of 
West D Street after the deputy, accompanied by Bryan, gave a ride home to a man 
who had been involved in a quarrel outside a Carson bar.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a situation where the man was being driven home as a courtesy to 
separate him from some trouble that occurred earlier," said Sheriff Sherman 
Block, who spent several hours Saturday at UCLA-Harbor Medical Center, where 
Wenger was taken for treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, authorities say, Derek Pettis somehow wrestled Wenger's gun away from 
him, shot the deputy and then killed Bryan, apparently as he was attempting to 
flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Wenger was listed in critical condition Saturday after undergoing a delicate 
operation to save his right eye. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan, who was shot four times, including once in the back of the head, was 
pronounced dead at Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Harbor City, Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities arrested Pettis, 25, in his room at a nearby boardinghouse about 
four hours after the shootings occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Block said investigators probably will not know exactly what happened 
until they are able to talk to the deputy, the sheriff said evidence at the 
scene indicated that Bryan, who has participated in the Sheriff's Department's 
volunteer chaplain program for six years, was chased and "gunned down 
execution-style." 
</P>
<P>
 "Judging from the trail of shell casings and what we believe was the angle of 
the gunfire, it appears that Deputy Wenger was shot at close range with his own 
gun and that the chaplain was chased for up to 150 feet and shot while on or 
close to the ground," Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheriff said investigators were working on the assumption that the suspect 
may have believed that he had killed the deputy, and was intent on eliminating 
Bryan to ensure that there would be no witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputy's gun and flashlight were found in a vacant lot a few hundred feet 
from the murder scene, Block said. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the chaplain's death stunned his friends and colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there was anyone who was out there to help people, it was Bruce," said 
Capt. Joe James, who heads the Carson sheriff's station. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies there said Bryan sometimes went on "ride-alongs" with deputies two 
and three nights a week, and almost always on Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 Like other chaplains who routinely ride with officers, Bryan was involved in a 
variety of tasks, including helping defuse domestic disputes, consoling 
distraught crime victims and offering words of encouragement to crime suspects 
and law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 An ordained minister since 1988, Bryan made his living operating the New Heart 
Mission in Carson, a nonprofit home for troubled men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bruce had had a rough time of it as a young person and was devoted to helping 
other people in trouble," said Debbie Schmidt, his fiancee, who worked with him 
at the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple met at a church service five years ago, and became engaged last 
Christmas, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had the respect of people on the street," said Tim Garcia, an associate 
pastor at South Bay Calvary Chapel, where Bryan was ordained. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials said Bryan was the sort of person they could call at all 
hours if a problem warranted, whether it was someone in custody who was 
distraught or a sheriff's deputy who needed a shoulder to lean on. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a letter from a woman whose husband beat her up several years ago 
and who wrote to thank us that (Bryan) had stopped later to make sure 
everything was OK," said James, the station captain. 
</P>
<P>
 "She said, 'We've solved our problems now and are both active in church, but I 
just wanted you to know what a difference your chaplain made.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although the area where the shootings occurred is outside the jurisdiction of 
the Sheriff's Department, Block said that Wenger and Bryan were there because 
the deputy was taking Pettis home after the disturbance at the Carson bar. 
Several deputies responded to the disturbance, and Wenger was asked to 
transport Pettis by one of the ranking officers at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Block noted that Wenger had served on a sheriff's gang detail until being 
reassigned to the Carson station last year, and was familiar with many of the 
area's gang members. Block said Pettis is a known gang member, but he did not 
know whether Wenger knew him. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Los Angeles vice officers heard the gunshots and were the first to arrive 
at the scene, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pettis' neighborhood, near where D Street intersects with Avalon Boulevard, is 
in a section of Wilmington dotted with liquor stores, boarded storefronts and 
rooming houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Silvas, the manager of the Holland Hotel, said Pettis had moved to one of 
those boardinghouses to share a room with his girlfriend about two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "He comes, he goes like other people," she said. "A lot of them rent by the 
week or the month. You don't ever know who you've got." 
</P>
<P>
 Few of the hotel's residents could say much about the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard gunshots, but then we're used to them," said Abraham Hernandez, 20. 
"People here don't make a habit of sticking their necks out."

 ROOSEVELT HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Javier Preciado and Lucy Godoy were honors students at Roosevelt High 
School on the Eastside. They took advanced placement courses in math and 
science but struggled with advanced English.  
</P>
<P>
 Preciado, 17, will attend UC Santa Cruz. Godoy, 18, is bound for UC Irvine.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HECTOR JAVIER PRECIADO: My language has played a major role in my education. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until the third grade that I started reading English. Most of the 
students at my school spoke English and I felt isolated from them because of 
the language barrier. 
</P>
<P>
 To me, speaking my native tongue incorrectly takes away part of my pride as a 
Mexican American. It is part of my roots, part of my history, part of my 
culture to learn the Spanish language correctly. It is important to know the 
language of your parents. 
</P>
<P>
 I think it's a shame that some students are disadvantaged both in English and 
Spanish. Bilingual education doesn't hurt students. It makes a student more 
complete. I value that Spanish that was taught to me early in my education. 
</P>
<P>
 But that same education didn't help me to succeed in English, especially in 
tests like the SAT. I got a 550 in math and 450 in English. 
</P>
<P>
 There's definitely a problem (in language instruction) that hasn't been 
solved. Everybody else is advancing except Latinos. Students are allowed to 
graduate from an American high school where English is spoken, but they cannot 
speak and write it. That is wasted student time, wasted teacher time and wasted 
L.A. Unified School District time. 
</P>
<P>
 The only English class that really challenged me was this year when I had AP 
(Advanced Placement) English. 
</P>
<P>
 In prior years I've had such easy classes. I could just sit through the class, 
write an essay every now and then and get an A. But in AP English you're forced 
to analyze poems, analyze essays, read stories. I had a difficult time with it 
at first, but I learned more this past semester than I have in four years of 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 It makes you think twice about what you know. It makes you question your 
intelligence. If you can't pass this high school course, how are you gonna do 
in college? 
</P>
<P>
 I think the English curriculum definitely has to improve for us. 
</P>
<P>
 Math here at Roosevelt is very advanced and is exceptionally good, but the 
quality of material being taught in English classes needs to be better. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, I see students writing essays -- and this is in my AP class -- and 
they're still using commas and periods incorrectly. I feel these problems need 
to be corrected early in our education so later we won't be embarrassed. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not good enough for us to just get by. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 LUCY GODOY: What happened to Hector also in a way has happened to me. 
</P>
<P>
 I was bilingual when I started school and I was put in English-only classes. 
At home my father spoke to me in English, my mother only Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 But when I speak Spanish, people don't know that I've been speaking English 
all my life and they think I am not a U.S. citizen. It is important to me to 
have a good Spanish accent. My family is from Mexico and I want people to know 
what ethnicity I am. When you speak Spanish you feel your culture. You know who 
you are.  
</P>
<P>
 Bilingual education is important. But not enough is being invested in it. The 
problem with it right now is that it stops in the middle. You don't teach 
students everything they need to know about English. And they lose their own 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 In my English classes I aced everything because the material doesn't challenge 
your intelligence. It just moves you along. 
</P>
<P>
 I've gotten a lot of A's. Then suddenly, boom, I take this AP English class 
and it really scares me. It really frightens me that this is what college might 
be like and I'm not doing so well in it. It shouldn't be this way. 
</P>
<P>
 In my other math classes, like calculus, I know that I am prepared. I am at an 
advantage in mathematics. You know they say mathematics is a universal 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the English part, the history classes, the social studies that I'm afraid 
of. I don't know how well I'll do in those. We can't make it just on math. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that it's just too easy here in California to graduate and get a 
diploma not knowing the skills that you need to make it out in the real world. 
</P>
<P>
 I also think it is important to have more Latino teachers. Students need to 
see teachers from their own culture, their own raza , who are succeeding. 
</P>
<P>
 One of my teachers, Mr. Quezada, he's played a very big role in my life. He's 
the one who said I had the potential to go to college. He told me I couldn't 
waste my intelligence. He told me, "Don't get married, go to college." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of his encouragement, I'm going to be an engineer.

WONG SLAYING SUSPECT SAYS HE'S NO 'PREDATOR'; CRIME: IN JAILHOUSE INTERVIEW, 
EDWARD PATRICK MORGAN TALKS AT LENGTH ABOUT HIS TROUBLED LIFE, POSSIBILITY OF 
FACING DEATH PENALTY. HE'S ACCUSED OF SAVAGE KILLING OF WOMAN OUTSIDE OF ORANGE 
NIGHTCLUB IN MAY.

<P>
 In an exclusive jailhouse interview Saturday, Edward Patrick Morgan denied 
being a monster who savagely battered to death and mutilated a 23-year-old 
Huntington Beach woman outside an Orange nightclub last month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm innocent," said Morgan, his hands cuffed tightly in front of him. "They 
got me out to be some mean basher that ripped some girl apart with my bare 
hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, who has three previous sexual assault convictions, disputed media 
portraits of him as a smooth-talking stalker from a troubled home, romancing 
women and then raping them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not true," said Morgan, who has been on suicide watch for much of the 
time since his latest arrest May 23. "I've always had girlfriends. I've been 
rejected just like anyone else. They got me out to be some predator." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan wouldn't comment on whether he knew Leanora Annette Wong, who police 
say Morgan lured from the Australian Beach Club May 20 and killed in a nearby 
parking lot, ripping apart her insides with an object detectives have yet to 
identify. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the security videotape that allegedly filmed the attack and the 
attacker is "not as explicit or graphic as they say." 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't show any kind of brutal killing," he said. "It doesn't even show a 
person you can identify. You can't see anyone killing anyone." 
</P>
<P>
 Behind a thick glass barrier at the Orange County Jail, Morgan, 28, talked at 
length about his life and the possibility of facing the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown-eyed, his brown hair neatly gelled, Morgan spoke with the boyish, 
slightly flirtatious charm of a brother's best friend. His yellow jail jumpsuit 
fit tightly around his bodybuilder's 5-foot-8, 200-pound bulk, and a black 
mermaid tattoo trailed down his right biceps. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said he fled to the small Northern California town of Quincy after 
Wong's slaying to hole up at his girlfriend's house while police nabbed the 
real killer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hoping they were going to catch the person that did it and I was just 
going to hide out there until they did," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Plumas County Sheriff's deputies tracked him down, he screamed "Shoot me! 
Shoot me! I didn't do it" because "I was innocent," Morgan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just knew what I was going to have to do. I was going to have to come back 
here and face a murder trial. I didn't want to hassle with it," he said. "I 
tried to get them to shoot me, but they wouldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Showing his only anger during the interview, Morgan said reporters had not 
gotten the complete story on his history of sex crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan didn't dispute that he had raped his 16-year-old ex-girlfriend in 
October, 1983, nor that a year later he had raped another 16-year-old outside a 
party in Buena Park. 
</P>
<P>
 He wouldn't talk about the assaults, citing his upcoming trial and a wish to 
forget that period of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't hear a bunch of Vietnam vets talking about the war," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court records, Morgan, then 19, sweet-talked the second girl into 
taking a walk with him, steering her to the darkness between two houses. When 
the girl objected, Morgan dragged her there, saying "I love you." When she 
continued to resist, he yanked her pants off and slammed her head and face 
against the pavement while he raped her. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan was convicted of both sex crimes and went to prison for the first time 
on Jan. 16, 1985. He was paroled 21 months later. 
</P>
<P>
 But Morgan said the second two women who have accused him of rape "are looney 
tunes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what's wrong with these girls. It was consensual," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the victims, a 16-year-old from Buena Park, said Morgan raped her in 
October, 1990, after she accepted a ride and drank beer with him. As part of a 
plea agreement, the rape charge was reduced to sex with a minor. Morgan was 
sentenced to one year, four months in custody. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, a 24-year-old Huntington Beach woman accused Morgan of 
handcuffing her to a tree in a park and raping her after she also accepted a 
ride and drank beer with him. Prosecutors, citing inconsistencies in the 
women's statements to police, declined to press charges. But the parole board 
revoked Morgan's parole, sending him back to prison for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan denied handcuffing the woman and said both the teen and the woman 
wanted to have sex with him and only went to the police to get attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are women that gave me their phone numbers after the fact," he said. 
"They let me drive them home and see where they live. If I never had a record 
before, those charges would've been dropped. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any girl can cry rape. If they don't like you, they could claim it. If 
they're obsessed with you, they could claim it. If this glass wasn't here, you 
could just yell to a deputy that I assaulted you, and who would they believe?" 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said that news stories painting his early family life in La Palma as 
troubled are exaggerated. A number of Morgan's closest friends from high school 
have said that Morgan and his mother often fought violent battles in front of 
them. Morgan said he wouldn't comment on his friends' observations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone's trying to blame my parents for everything, and it's not true," he 
said. "I've had good times and bad times like anyone else. I have not been 
abused." 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said his parents have stuck with him through his past convictions and 
have been very supportive since his latest arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most parents would have given up on their kids a long time ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his family has been shattered by his arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 "My dad's has a very bad heart," he said. "Something like this could kill 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Reached at his Strongsville, Ohio, home, Edward Morgan Sr., a retired Hoover 
vacuum executive, declined to talk about the allegations against his son. He 
said he only wanted to "express his sorrow" for Wong's family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope my son didn't do it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said he spends his days in isolation writing letters, reading the Bible 
and trying to stay away from "rat snitches who are trying to get close to me to 
cut time off their sentences." 
</P>
<P>
 And every day, he said, he tries not to think about a possible death sentence. 
But he said it's in his head, impossible to shake. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan said he enjoyed a brief distraction Friday afternoon listening to 
police chase former football star and fugitive O.J. Simpson across Southern 
California freeways. He kept his ear pressed to the door of his cell, straining 
to catch the sound of a faraway TV. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew exactly what he was going through in his mind just being on the run," 
Morgan said. "I was praying so hard that he wouldn't kill himself."

THE TASSEL WELL WORTH THE HASSLE; UCI CEREMONY TAKES ON DEGREE OF FUN FOR BEACH 
BALL-BOUNCING, TORTILLA-TOSSING GRADS 
</P>

 Thousands of parents, friends and well-wishers flocked to Aldrich Park at the 
heart of UC Irvine on Saturday to cheer more than 4,000 students at graduation 
ceremonies that challenged them to tackle the world's problems and defy the 
stereotype of twentysomethings as slackers. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call us the generation with no heroes, no direction and no style, but do 
we believe the doubters? No," said Nguyen-Hong Hoang, UCI's first-ever Harry S. 
Truman scholar and the student speaker for the graduating school of social 
sciences. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are the generation that resembles the butterfly, the generation unnoticed 
in its cocoon. We will emerge from that cocoon and soar higher and more 
majestically than any generation has done before us." 
</P>
<P>
 Her classmate, David Kesselman, traced the changes the world has undergone 
since his class entered the university: from the end of the Cold War to a more 
localized dilemma -- the 100% increase in tuition fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Kesselman, president of the Associated Students of UC Irvine, called on fellow 
students to address the "many problems facing this country and this world." 
</P>
<P>
 Between speakers, students decked out in black gowns and mortarboards flung 
tortillas in the air ("They're cheap and fly good," a campus police officer 
quipped) and swatted at a beach ball. One waved a sign that read "Free O.J.," 
in honor of the football hero arrested on suspicion of murder, and decorated 
his cap with the words "Damn It's Hot." 
</P>
<P>
 But the mood was largely reflective as students took the stage in three 
ceremonies Saturday -- one for bioscience, engineering and physical science 
students; a second for the school of social science; and a third for students 
of fine arts, humanities, computer science, social ecology and 
interdisciplinary studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Graduates ranged from the 12-year-old Masoud Karkehadadi -- a child genius 
whose lab work may be unlocking the mysteries of Parkinson's disease -- to 
72-year-old Margaret Jones, who returned to school for a bachelor's degree in 
social science after a 50-year lapse. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones started her college schooling in Berkeley, but World War II and the 
raising of five children interfered. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't do anything differently, except to tell young people to finish 
what they started," said Jones, who belongs to a UC Irvine group of returning 
students called "The Oasis."  
</P>
<P>
 About 3,400 UCI seniors graduated Saturday, along with 640 graduate students. 
The 29th graduating class is the most ethnically diverse of any at UCI, a 
campus spokeswoman said. Campus police estimated that 30,000 people attended 
the day's events. 
</P>
<P>
 But 22-year-old September Whitmire, an African American political science 
student from Huntington Beach, said she still found the Irvine campus 
frustrating at times. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were lot of trials, a lot of tribulations. A lot of people are not open 
to diversity," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 For some students, prospects of a new independence were dampened by the 
specter of unemployment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a universal apprehension that you're not going to get a job," 
said Kelly Root, 21, a political science graduate from Hacienda Heights. "I 
just got a note from my dad's insurance company saying I'm no longer on his 
health insurance plan. It's a bit scary coming out from under Mom and Dad's 
wing." 
</P>
<P>
 The thought crossed some other minds as well: Parents returned to their cars 
to find flyers under their windshield wipers advertising low health insurance 
rates for their newly independent offspring. 
</P>
<P>
 Some students, however, were less concerned with financial stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Alex Blank, 22, of New Jersey graduated Saturday with a degree in economics. 
He plans to take the summer and drive across the country in his 1977 Dodge van, 
adorned with mounted bullhorns, and peddle the adult videos that helped put him 
through school. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he comes back? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking to start my own business -- a Philadelphia cheese steak 
restaurant, probably in Anaheim," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The day was a milestone for many parents, who waited eagerly throughout the 
ceremony bearing bouquets of flowers and bunches of congratulatory balloons. 
</P>
<P>
 About 30 relatives came from San Diego and the Los Angeles area to watch Asbed 
Tatoulian graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm proud, very happy," said his father, the Rev. Datev Tatoulian of St. John 
Armenian Apostolic Church in San Diego. He also has two daughters, one in 
junior college. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not easy financially. We are really sacrificing a lot, but we believe in 
education," he said. "It's a victory and a day of joy -- a day to be proud." 
</P>
<P>
 John Forstrom's family abandoned their spot in the shade for a few quick 
moments to cluster closer to the stage and whoop for the political science 
major from Thousand Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 "He got his cheer!" said his mother, Marlene Forstrom. "We were afraid he 
wasn't here because we couldn't find him at first. We were going to be real 
upset if we came and he didn't."

POLITICS '94: A BEHIND-THE-SCENES LOOK AT ORANGE COUNTY'S POLITICAL LIFE ; 
ROHRABACHER SEEKS TO HELP CANDIDATES MATCH OPPONENTS' WAR CHESTS 
</P>

 Playground for the rich?: Seeking to level the campaign playing field between 
multimillionaire candidates and those less wealthy, Rep. Dana Rohrabacher 
(R-Huntington Beach) has offered a solution: If a candidate spends $1 million 
of his or her own money, Rohrabacher's bill would allow the opponent to solicit 
contributions of $10,000 from 100 contributors, $100,000 from 10 contributors, 
"or even $1 million from any legal source of contributions." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not just aimed at Mike Huffington," Rohrabacher said, referring to 
the Republican congressman from Santa Barbara who has poured millions of 
dollars into his campaign to unseat Democratic U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein, who 
also is independently wealthy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's obvious to everyone that neither of them would have been the candidates 
for their parties if they had not dumped millions of dollars into their 
campaigns," Rohrabacher said. "We allowed them to buy the election. It's 
happening throughout the country, and in both parties." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Nothing personal: After years of trying, Rep. Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach)--joined by four other Republican congressmen--finally won House approval 
to eliminate funding for the Interstate Commerce Commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that's the same commission that Orange County Republican businessman Gus 
A. Owen was recently appointed to by President Clinton. Owen's appointment is 
awaiting Senate approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox said he discussed with Owen the need to do away with the ICC, which 
regulates the transportation industry. "Three of the members (on the 
five-member) commission are the ones that got me started in the first place," 
Cox said, explaining how he became convinced several years ago that the agency 
is almost obsolete. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Senate gives its approval to stop funding the agency, it will save $150 
million over five years, Cox said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Post-election blues: Marilyn C. Brewer, the Republican nominee in the 70th 
Assembly District, was attacked by her rivals for being a former Democrat. So 
of course she didn't laugh when Assemblyman Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), 
referring to her primary victory, joked that while the Democrats may have 
trouble winning in Republican-rich Orange County, they had infiltrated the GOP. 
</P>
<P>
 Angered, Brewer again defended her Republican credentials and pledged to 
contribute at least $1,000 to Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, Umberg's opponent in the 
November general election. She also called Umberg "unfit to be attorney 
general, and even to serve in the state Legislature." 
</P>
<P>
 "We apologize if it was taken personally," responded George Urch, Umberg's 
aide. "But we expect her to support the Republican now." 
</P>
<P>
 Brewer's counterattack against Umberg, Urch added, was a "little bit over the 
edge." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Democratic ties: Brewer's campaign consultant, Harvey Englander, has kept mum 
about the Washington-based political consulting firm he will be 
joining--pending the completion of final details--except to say he will remain 
in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 But here's a huge hint: While out of town last week, Englander left a 
telephone number where he could be reached on his answering machine. The number 
belongs to the Kamber Group, a well-known firm that has strong ties to 
Democrats and labor unions, as well as major corporations. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Reality check: Situated deep in archconservative south Orange County, Dana 
Point has never been mistaken for such liberal heartlands as Santa Monica or 
even Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 But check again. The five-member Dana Point City Council now has two 
Democrats--Karen Lloreda and Harold R. Kaufman--as a result of the June 7 
election. A third member, Mayor Judy Curreri, was one of the "Clinton 
Eight"--high-profile Republicans who crossed party lines in 1992 to back 
Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never have thought . . . when we started working on incorporation, 
that our council would have a political affiliation mix similar to Laguna 
Beach," said outgoing Councilman Mike Eggers, an aide to Rep. Ron Packard 
(R-Oceanside). "I don't think they'll be having a city-sponsored testimonial 
dinner for Rush Limbaugh anytime soon." O.C. Primary Voter Profile 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats and Republicans who voted in the June 7 primary have some similar 
demographic characteristics. 03,24,11,13 Democrats Republicans Gender Male 46%

HARBOR GATES COSTING MERCHANTS BUSINESS; DANA POINT: MANY COMPLAIN THAT THE NEW 
PAY-TO-PARK SYSTEM IS KEEPING CUSTOMERS AWAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEN HALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost everyone seems to agree on one thing about the new pay-to-park gates at 
Dana Point Harbor: They're a disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 Owners of harbor businesses, from the large, upscale restaurants to the quaint 
gift shops, say they have suffered financially because many customers are 
staying away from the harbor where parking had been free for 23 years. 
</P>
<P>
 But few agree on what should be done about the 2-month-old plan that costs 
harbor visitors $2 an hour and up to $18 a day for parking. Once, merchants 
thought a modest parking fee would control the parking lots and keep 
non-customers from hogging parking spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, there's talk about switching to valet parking, imposing a flat parking 
fee, having paid parking at peak hours only, or perhaps removing the parking 
gates entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were all for this parking idea at one time, but most of us are outraged 
now," said Peggie Pearson of Huntington Beach, owner of the small In-Things 
shop in Mariner's Village. "We were for parking control, not $2 an hour and $18 
maximum a day. As it is, I'm going broke." 
</P>
<P>
 Yank the gates out, said De Francis, owner of the Chocolate Soldier, whose 
business is down 250%. 
</P>
<P>
 "What has happened is we now have all the parking in the world because nobody 
is using this facility. . . . All I want is for my customers to be happy," said 
Francis, a Laguna Beach resident and a shop owner for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The gates were installed in the Mariner's Village and Dana Wharf parking areas 
April 15 to counter what the large harbor leaseholders and restaurateurs 
considered a serious parking problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies showed there were enough spaces, but they were being used for long 
stays by employees, beach-goers and boaters as well as the shoppers.  
</P>
<P>
 The problems had escalated over the years as the harbor's popularity 
increased, said Morris Harrison, the owner of Dana Village Properties, one of 
two master leaseholders of the harbor's retail shops who shared the $150,000 
cost to install the gates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the county controls the harbor, it is the master leaseholders who 
control the parking and the gates, at least until their leases run out in 2001. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason we did this was because people were driving around in circles 
and complaining there was no place to park," Harrison said.  
</P>
<P>
 About 850 of the harbor's 1,623 spaces have been gated. But they were the most 
popular parking areas, those at the main entrance to the harbor near Doheny 
State Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Restaurants offer validations for two hours of parking, retail shops one hour, 
and the sports fishing docks give four hours of free parking. Visitors wishing 
only to pick up or drop someone off can enter the gated parking area for 15 
minutes without charge. 
</P>
<P>
 However, many merchants say that word has spread quickly that it now costs to 
park, and customers are staying away in droves. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a total boycott among the locals," Pearson said. "The first month, 
out of nine cars that came to the gates, eight made a U-turn and left. Every 
seller will tell you the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison and Robert Mardian, owner of the Wind & Sea and Harpoon Henry's 
restaurants, blame most of the problems on a poor economy and a period of 
adjustment to the new pay-to-park policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made a quantum-leap change after having free parking for 23 years," 
Mardian said. "We are now getting a backlash. . . . But I ultimately believe 
the parking system will work with some refinements." 
</P>
<P>
 Mardian would like to see the gates opened from Monday through Thursday all 
winter and a flat three-hour validation.  
</P>
<P>
 Jim Miller, chairman of the merchants' parking committee, favors the 
three-hour idea.  
</P>
<P>
 "I understand the public's frustration, but we had a serious problem," Miller 
said. "If they hadn't been complaining, we wouldn't have done this." Pay to 
Park 
</P>
<P>
 Dana Point Harbor business owners want to ditch the new pay gates they say are 
driving away customers, who are charged as much as $18 a day to park. Parking 
at the harbor was free until the gates were installed two months ago. There is 
no agreement on an alternative plan to the gates. How parking works now: 
</P>
<P>
 (Gated visitor lots) 
</P>
<P>
 With Validation: Restaurants: Two hours of free parking* Shops: One hour of 
free parking* Dana Wharf: Four hours of free parking*

200 ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION OPPONENTS ATTEND CONFERENCE; BORDER: ORGANIZERS AND 
PARTICIPANTS HOPE TO WIN PASSAGE OF CONTROVERSIAL SAVE OUR STATE INITIATIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Nearly 200 opponents of illegal immigration gathered Saturday for an all-day 
workshop on the issue, offering solutions to what some called the 
"out-of-control problem" of undocumented immigrants arriving here. 
</P>
<P>
 Groups from across the state that oppose illegal immigration and seek to cap 
the number of legal immigrants allowed into the country annually participated 
in the conference, organized by United We Stand America and held at the Sequoia 
Athletic Club. They said they hope to combine their efforts to win passage of 
the controversial Save Our State initiative, which sponsors hope to place on 
the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Sturdevant, coordinator of United We Stand America's immigration task 
force, called the alliance's plan to protect the country's borders "tough 
love." 
</P>
<P>
 The SOS initiative seeks to prohibit illegal immigrants from receiving public 
social services, educational benefits and health care. It also would make it a 
felony to manufacture, distribute, use or sell false documents in order to 
obtain benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative needs the valid signatures of nearly 385,000 registered voters 
by June 30 to qualify for the November ballot. Sponsors have turned in nearly 
600,000 signatures, of which more than 200,000 have been validated. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers told attendees at the conference that there was still much work to be 
done to ensure the initiative's passage. 
</P>
<P>
 During an afternoon workshop, speakers taught the group to express concerns by 
writing their elected representatives and local newspapers, calling radio talk 
shows and joining organizations that focus on immigration issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to teach people how to be effective when talking to politicians," 
said Alf Powers, spokesman for United We Stand America. "We aren't here to 
rehash the issue, but to achieve solutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Activist groups such as Save Our State and Californians for Population 
Stabilization were joined at the conference by State Rep. Richard L. Mountjoy 
(R-Arcadia); Phil Romero, chief economist for Gov. Pete Wilson; U.S. Rep. Ed 
Royce (R-Fullerton) and Yorba Linda Mayor Barbara Kiley, who supported the 
mostly older crowd's desire to get involved in the immigration issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government has not defined the immigration laws and without a 
clear definition, there can be no solution," said Cordelia Spicer, issues 
adviser to Ross Perot, whose 1992 independent presidential campaign gave rise 
to United We Stand America. "We want to be humane, but our laws have created an 
underground (society) of immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Romero said groups opposed to illegal immigration have been accused of racism 
but contended the issue isn't about race. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's "concern (with illegal immigration) has nothing to do with race," 
Romero said. "His sole concern is to lift the financial burden caused by 
illegal immigrants." 
</P>
<P>
 Mountjoy agreed, saying: "What is racist about wanting to protect our borders? 
Nothing. It (the initiative) will pass because it is right and because it is 
supported by all races, religions and creeds."

 PALISADES HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 Ilya Monroe, 18, says that the quality of public education is unequal and that 
there are not enough minorities in honors classes. She is enrolled at Antioch 
College in Ohio for the fall.  
</P>
<P>
 Dan Skootsky, 18, contends that educators should focus on academics, not 
racial issues. He will study next year at the New Mexico Institute of Mining 
and Technology.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 ILYA MONROE: The bulk of the African American students stay in the cafeteria, 
a lot of the Hispanic students stay in the back of the cafeteria, a lot of the 
white students are on the quad. It's like different neighborhoods in the same 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 Students gravitate toward people they believe to be on their same academic 
level. People mentioned it a lot that there are very few African American and 
Hispanic students in honors classes, which are predominantly white. The more 
remedial classes are predominantly black and Hispanic. 
</P>
<P>
 I think if education is more focused and stronger for African American and 
Hispanic students at a younger age, there would be less division in high 
school. I really don't think that integration can be attained at a high school 
level because the stereotypes have already been implanted. 
</P>
<P>
 I think that strenuous teaching needs to begin at a younger age and more 
strongly focus on math and science.  
</P>
<P>
 African American and Hispanic kids need to be made aware of what is available 
to them if they take the harder courses. But if they spend their whole high 
school career taking ceramics electives, that is not a future. 
</P>
<P>
 In high school, I think there is tracking. You have regular classes and honors 
classes. It doesn't necessarily bother me that there are different levels of 
classes, but it bothers me that most of the honors classes are taken up by a 
certain race. I've accepted it as a fact, but I don't appreciate it, I don't 
support it. 
</P>
<P>
 There needs to be some kind of encouragement, nourishment, something to help 
the kids who are not in the honors classes. Kids need to be instilled with 
confidence that they can perform to their abilities. 
</P>
<P>
 I think the better teachers should be teaching more of the non-honors classes. 
I think that would add some sort of balance. If they are strong enough teachers 
they should be able to enthrall all students and make them want to learn what 
they have to teach. 
</P>

<P>
 DAN SKOOTSKY: No one is barred from taking a certain class because of their 
race. If they have the motivation, if they have the determination to stick 
through that class, they are going to make it. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to start focusing more on the individual student. Educators can start 
by providing more personal counseling that would follow through a student's 
school career. 
</P>
<P>
 We change counselors all the time. Basically, the job of the counselor now is 
to take care of your scheduling problems. They say you can talk to them about 
your future, your problems, but the environment is not conducive to that. 
</P>
<P>
 Another thing schools need to focus more on is science and technology. I think 
if we look at our nation as a whole, we are falling behind in that area. We 
focus on social issues a lot. Classes on racial issues, that's good, I'm all 
for that. But as a foundation, we need more on the basics like science and 
math. 
</P>
<P>
 Our schools need equipment; everything is antiquated. I would have greatly 
appreciated having up-to-date lab equipment, electronic equipment and 
computers. There is no real class for computers. There is a computer 
programming class, but we work on 10-year-old Apple computers. Let me give you 
an example of something that is working here. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the media center, a new program at school. We've had students of all 
races involved. The theme is uniting through communication. It started 
basically as a project to develop a radio station at Pali, but pretty soon we 
started getting into video and produced the Video Timeline, a cable television 
version of our school paper. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not doing this for a grade, but the value of experience is our lesson. 
</P>
<P>
 You can't survive in this program without being able to communicate well with 
people. You have to depend on others and others depend on you. If you don't do 
your work, it's not like you get a bad grade. If you don't do it, the newspaper 
doesn't come out or somebody else had to do the work for you, then what are 
they going to think of you?

 LOCKE HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 Tiffany Meador, 18, began high school on the Westside but transferred to her 
home school in South-Central Los Angeles because of family problems. Patricia 
Ramos, 18, came to Locke after being kicked out of her neighborhood high 
school.  
</P>
<P>
 Both have been accepted to colleges and are awaiting word on financial aid.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 TIFFANY MEADOR: I left Hamilton High School in the middle of the 11th grade. I 
was getting Cs instead of my usual A's and Bs. Too many people were living in 
the house. I couldn't concentrate. I couldn't write essays. 
</P>
<P>
 I was roller coasting through life at the time. When I first started high 
school, I wanted to learn. But when my situation at home developed, I asked 
myself "What's the use of learning? I'm going to end up like them anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 My attitude changed (at Locke). But having teachers who actually realize what 
we have to go through, that would help our education. All the kids in this 
school, we live in the same neighborhood, we hear the same gunshots, we hear 
the same helicopter flying over. 
</P>
<P>
 If a teacher sees that someone has been absent two or three days, they should 
ask what's wrong, instead of saying smart comments like "If you were here, you 
would have had gotten that assignment and I wouldn't have to repeat myself." 
</P>
<P>
 What people don't realize though, is that the worse students feel, the less 
they learn. One negative comment last year enlightened me. 
</P>
<P>
 When I came to Locke and wrote my first essay, my teacher accused me of 
plagiarism. You know, I don't have much pride in anything, but when it comes to 
my writing I will do anything to defend what is mine. My writing comes from 
inside me. 
</P>
<P>
 I confronted him. He told me to write it over and turn in another essay. I 
told him, "I will write it in front of your face." I came in on a Saturday 
morning and wrote a new essay. He read it and he was shocked. It was about 
Clinton's stand on immigration. He apologized and gave me extra credit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end it made me feel good that something I wrote was so good that my 
teacher called me a plagiarist. I was that good to be called a plagiarist. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers need to find ways to help teach the students who look like they don't 
want to be taught. People who do want to be taught are the easy ones. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 PATRICIA RAMOS: I got kicked out of Fremont High on the first day of school 
for getting in a fight with rival gang girls. It all began in the seventh 
grade, when I started getting involved in gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 You know, we used to fight and now I don't even know why -- for a street and 
name that doesn't even belong to us? 
</P>
<P>
 But even though I used to get in fights, I had good grades. 
</P>
<P>
 It's true what Tiffany said. Teachers don't understand how we live. Maybe if 
they knew our family environment, our community environment, they would 
understand us more and could help us more. 
</P>
<P>
 I wish they understood my lifestyle. I clean, cook, study. I don't really go 
out. On Saturdays I work at McDonald's. I take care of my brothers. It's a lot 
of responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing in my education was the teachers who gave me confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Mr. Mandell, he's the only one here who knows what my life is really like. 
When he sees me mad or depressed he will sit me down and talk to me about 
what's wrong. And I will tell him. When my brother was being treated real bad 
at school because he's a special education student, Mr. Mandell gave me a phone 
number for someone who is now helping.  
</P>
<P>
 Now he's putting me in contact with someone who is helping me find a job so I 
can at least pay for some of my books for college.  
</P>
<P>
 I would like to tell all the adults to really listen to the students. Listen 
to what we want because it's our education and we should be able to express 
ourselves and say what our needs are. Attention: That is one thing we need. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not getting the attention or the education to be prepared for life, 
especially in this community, where violence and gangs happen a lot in our 
lives.

WHAT'S IN A NAME? A LOT, IF IT'S YAROSLAVSKY; POLITICS: IF SHE SEEKS HER 
HUSBAND'S CITY COUNCIL SEAT, BARBARA YAROSLAVSKY WILL HAVE INSTANT VOTER 
RECOGNITION. BUT SOME OBJECT TO WHAT THEY CALL CREATION OF A DYNASTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Her name brings instant voter recognition. She is well liked and highly 
visible in her community. But if she runs for office, she will face charges 
that she is attempting to create a political dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the dilemma facing Barbara Yaroslavsky, who acknowledged last week 
that she may run for the Los Angeles City Council seat vacated by her husband, 
Zev, who was elected to the Board of Supervisors earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been encouraged and flattered," Barbara Yaroslavsky said of interest 
shown by friends and political advisers in her possible quest for the seat her 
husband held for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of the best-kept secrets in town," said real estate mogul Stanley 
Hirsh, a Studio City resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Ticking off her attributes, Hirsh praised her as bright and personable. He 
also noted that she is involved in Jewish religious and charitable causes in a 
Westside and Sherman Oaks-based council district where Jewish voters exercise 
tremendous clout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she runs and she wins," said veteran Democratic political consultant 
Joe Cerrell. "I'm not saying it's a slam dunk, but she starts out with what is 
a very good political name in this city. And she can raise good sums of money 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 But others say that having Barbara Yaroslavsky on the City Council and Zev 
Yaroslavsky on the Board of Supervisors would create a regrettable political 
dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too much in the same family," said Sandy Brown, a Westside activist who 
has frequently clashed with Zev Yaroslavsky on development issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she runs, I think there'll be a backlash against it. We've already had 19 
years of Zev and then to have . . . another Yaroslavsky is too much," added 
Brown, who is president of the Holmby-Westwood Property Owners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 City Council President John Ferraro said he expects that the council will 
decide to schedule a special election for Zev Yaroslavsky's seat that coincides 
with the city's regular municipal elections next April. 
</P>
<P>
 Others who have expressed interest in running for the office include former 
Los Angeles school board President Roberta Weintraub and Bet Tzedek Executive 
Director Michael Feuer. 
</P>
<P>
 Feuer said that his decision to run is irreversible and that he has even 
agreed to resign in December as head of Bet Tzedek, a legal services group, so 
he can campaign full time. "There's no turning back," Feuer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Weintraub, once a Republican and leader of the San Fernando Valley anti-busing 
movement in the late 1970s, re-registered as a Democrat a few years ago and 
already is campaigning for the council seat. She has met with homeowner leaders 
and toured city parks and police stations in the 5th District to familiarize 
herself with key municipal services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going full bore on this," said Weintraub. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Lea Purwin D'Agostino, a deputy district attorney who ran a 
quixotic campaign in 1988 against her then-boss, Ira Reiner, reportedly had 
several political meetings to discuss running for the 5th District seat. Bill 
Christopher, an architect and leading neighborhood activist, filed the 
paperwork necessary to begin raising money for the race. Ryan Snyder, a 
transportation consultant who previously ran against Zev Yaroslavsky, filed his 
papers earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Barbara Yaroslavsky said she has yet to fully discuss her 
possible campaign with her husband, but she expects to do so soon. "We have 
been so busy with the election (for supervisor) that I haven't sat down with 
Zev to go over the pros and cons of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked how she would react if her husband were to express concern that her 
entrance in the council race might reflect badly on him, she said, "I'd have to 
take that into consideration. But I don't see that happening at all." 
</P>
<P>
 And what if her husband advised her not to run? 
</P>
<P>
 "He wouldn't say that," she said. "That's not the way our relationship works." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who know the couple agree. But there are those who believe Zev 
Yaroslavsky privately does not want his wife to seek his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's enthusiastic at all about this," said one knowledgeable 
source active in Westside political circles. "It could be that he thinks it 
would hurt him politically or that he doesn't want to share the spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked recently about his wife's prospective political career, Yaroslavsky 
replied: "Talk to my wife." 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, talk of Barbara Yaroslavsky's candidacy raises the dynasty issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a hereditary monarchy," said one critic, who asked for anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cerrell and other observers say that Barbara Yaroslavsky should be able to 
deflect such reactions by presenting herself as an independent-minded and 
credible candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Yaroslavsky herself said last week: "I just don't see it as a 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 County and city government activities don't overlap much, she said, so 
opportunities for her and her husband to coordinate their powerful positions 
would be limited. "There's too much independence," she said. "They'd have to 
feed off each other for there to be a dynasty problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But some, such as Sandy Brown, the Westside activist, said the issue is one of 
fairness. "My concern really is what kind of arm-twisting will Zev do to get 
her elected," Brown said. And after Barbara Yaroslavsky, who's next? 
</P>
<P>
 "Their teen-age daughter?" Brown sarcastically quipped.

TOLLWAY OPPONENTS PREPARE FOR NEW PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THUAN LE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 100 people gathered Saturday to stage another tollway protest and to 
talk future strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers warned the group to prepare for the worst if bulldozers return 
Tuesday to begin construction on a 17-mile road stretching between Newport 
Beach and San Juan Capistrano. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach Councilwoman Lida Lenney asked people to keep in touch and be 
ready to demonstrate Monday night or early Tuesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need people here in numbers so they can't arrest us and bodily carry us 
away," Lenney told the cheering crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators congratulated each other for helping to persuade the U.S. 
9th Circuit Court of Appeals to issue a temporary injunction that on Wednesday 
halted bulldozers grading the hill on the Laguna greenbelt. 
</P>
<P>
 But organizers, pointing out the destruction of 100-year-old oak trees and 
bushes near the existing Laguna Canyon Road, bemoaned the damage already done 
before the injunction was issued. 
</P>
<P>
 The injunction expires Tuesday, when the panel of judges can either extend it 
or allow construction workers back on the hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Before organizers spoke to the group, many demonstrators held signs protesting 
the bulldozing of the Laguna Greenbelt. One sign said: "Why turn paradise into 
a concrete jungle???? (Grrrr!)" 
</P>
<P>
 At noon, protesters held hands in a large circle. In the center, a 
husband-and-wife team of spiritual healers, Vera and Manuel Rocha, from the 
Gabrielino Shoshone Nation, performed a ceremony to pray for the land. 
Afterward, three Aztecs performed several dances. 
</P>
<P>
 Vera Rocha, 65, urged protesters to stand strong against development. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're murdering this land," she said.

MAN ESCAPES WITH CASH FROM BANK IN HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A robber used a note to demand money from a teller at Household Bank and 
escaped with an undetermined amount of cash, police said Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Luis Ochoa said the robber entered the bank in the 19000 block of Beach 
Boulevard at 11 a.m. and shoved a note to the teller. As the teller opened the 
drawer and reached in for a stack of bills, the robber leaned across the 
counter and also reached into the drawer, Ochoa said. 
</P>
<P>
 The robber, who was wearing a light-colored baseball cap, dark pants and white 
athletic shoes, fled on foot, police said. He never displayed a weapon and no 
injuries were reported.

FULLERTON COLLEGE STUDENT CROWNED MISS CALIFORNIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jennifer Hanson, a 20-year-old student at Fullerton College, was crowned Miss 
California on Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe this is happening.I'm just, like, shocked. It's something I 
worked really hard at," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson was crowned by last year's Miss California, Lisa Michelle Duncan of 
Tulare, and the 1994 Miss America, Kimberly Aiken. 
</P>
<P>
 The newly crowned Miss California will compete in the Miss America Pageant on 
Sept. 17 in Atlantic City, N.J. She also received a $10,000 scholarship and a 
new wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 The first runner-up was Miss San Francisco, Alicia E. Howard. The second 
runner-up was Miss Covina, Cori Jay Wellins. 
</P>
<P>
 The other finalists in the competition were: Miss San Diego East County, 
Barbara Lynn Humes; Miss Tulare County, Jennifer Lynn Cordua; Miss Sacramento 
County, Kristine Marie Smith; Miss San Joaquin County, Tracy Kathleen Hayes; 
Miss Greater Riverside County, Soraya Larissa Haeri, and Miss Greater East Bay, 
Anna Juliet Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 For the talent competition, Hanson, Miss Garden Grove, sang "Since I Fell for 
You," a blues vocal selection. 
</P>
<P>
 The talent portion of the three-day pageant accounts for 40% of each 
contestant's score. Another 30% is given for a 12-minute private interview and 
15% each for evening wear and swimsuit competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 The pageant was televised from the Saroyan Theatre in Fresno, only the third 
city to host the contest during its 70-year history.

WORLD CUP USA '94; PRIME TIME; VALDERRAMA AND REST OF THE WORLD'S BEST PLAYERS 
CAN CREATE HAIR-RAISING SITUATIONS FOR OPPOSING DEFENSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE PENNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In football, baseball and hockey, they do whatever they can to cover it up. In 
basketball, they are determined to get rid of it altogether, soon to leave us 
with an entire league of players whose heads are smoother than the ball they 
use to clank off the backboard. 
</P>
<P>
 But in soccer, hair is celebrated, liberated, allowed to grow and flow, 
rolling down the necks of Spaniards, coursing against the backs of Bolivians, 
venerated to the point where the world's best player, Roberto Baggio of Italy, 
showed up at training camp this year with one fervent request: 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't ask me to cut my ponytail." 
</P>
<P>
 And nowhere in soccer is hair celebrated the way it is atop the head of 
Colombia midfielder Carlos Valderrama, whose glowing out-of-control blond Afro 
is already the No. 1 tourist attraction in the 1994 World Cup -- and rumored to 
once have helped land night flights at the airport in Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
 Mere words fall short when attempting to convey the awesomeness of 
Valderrama's hair in motion during a match, rising and setting like the sun 
with every stride downfield. 
</P>
<P>
 How does one describe the indescribable? 
</P>
<P>
 One of Van Gogh's sunflowers on the loose? 
</P>
<P>
 A movable haystack? 
</P>
<P>
 Medusa's serpents with a bad case of jaundice? 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek has nominated Valderrama as "most telegenic" player in this World Cup 
and already, photographers are prepping for Wednesday's match between Colombia 
and the United States, which figures to yield the shot of the tournament -- a 
potential midair collision between Valderrama and Alexi Lalas, the red-haired 
Rasputin of the American back line. 
</P>
<P>
 One head ball between those two and they'll need extra time to detangle the 
mess. 
</P>
<P>
 As cameras rat-tat-tat around him and rabid fans in cheesy yellow fright wigs 
follow him from stadium to stadium, Valderrama wonders what the fuss is about. 
On the Caribbean coast of Colombia, where he was born and raised, Valderrama 
claims his look is common. In the beach town of Santa Marta, men grow their 
hair long and unruly, he says, and the tropical sun bleaches it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Contrary to what some say, my hair is natural," Valderrama once said. "I was 
lucky to be successful, and my hair helped me to become known. I will not 
change it for anything in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Why would he? 
</P>
<P>
 Valderrama's burning bush has a become a symbol for a nation, and something of 
a personal spokesman for the wearer. Valderrama is notoriously soft-spoken; he 
barely raises his voice above a whisper during interviews, saying little. South 
American journalists describe him as misterioso . Valderrama prefers to let his 
follicles do the talking for him. His hair is there for interpretation, and it 
is scrutinized for hidden meaning, much the way rock fans in the '60s played 
Beatles records backward. 
</P>
<P>
 So an English soccer publication studies Valderrama's hair and surmises that 
it is "a metaphor for his football: dense, flamboyant and totally 
unconventional." 
</P>
<P>
 And Antonio Correa, the Colombian soccer team liaison, says Valderrama's hair 
"expresses what type of person he really is. He comes across as introverted, 
quiet and methodical, yet he's capable of doing these pretty incredible things 
on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 Valderrama is no goal scorer. In almost 10 years with the Colombian national 
team, he has but five goals. He has never been especially swift afoot, and now 
he is 32, four months removed from arthroscopic knee surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, on a continent with Romario and Maradona and Bebeto, Valderrama was voted 
South America's player of the year in 1993, duplicating his 1987 achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 He won it the same way Magic Johnson won his MVP awards -- for re-inventing 
his position, for playmaking that boggles the mind, for dribbling and passing 
and doing things with the ball previously regarded beyond the reach of the 
human race. 
</P>
<P>
 Sigi Schmid, an assistant coach with the U.S. team, calls Valderrama "the one 
guy I'd pay to watch play in the World Cup." 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Davis, former U.S. star and now a World Cup commentator, played against 
Valderrama several times in international competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "What he does out there is magic -- there's no other word for it," Davis said. 
"The guy can just cut a team apart." 
</P>
<P>
 Valderrama describes his soccer as "happy," that it is his "purpose to give 
the people of Colombia a moment of happiness. I think when we step on the field 
and play the way we do, we bring happiness." 
</P>
<P>
 And leave the talking to others, such as in Brazil, where Romario and Bebeto 
are only too glad to pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario and Bebeto are reasons 1 and 2 as to why Brazil is among the favorites 
to win this year's World Cup. Or reasons 2 and 1, depending on who's speaking. 
</P>
<P>
 Romario is only too glad to tell anyone within earshot that "Brazil will be 
the new world champion and I will be be the best possible help for the team and 
our million fans." 
</P>
<P>
 He also proclaims: "It will become my tournament." 
</P>
<P>
 By Romario standards, these are gross understatements. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Romario wear the No. 10 jersey of the legendary Pele, but he has 
called Pele "mentally retarded" and "a museum piece." So far this year he has 
lambasted Brazilian Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira for naming Rai to the World 
Cup squad ahead of Valdo (Rai is merely team captain); ridiculed teammate 
Muller for being nothing more than a good club player; and refused to sit next 
to Bebeto on a charter flight to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is better, Romario or Bebeto, is a debate that has been waged for years, 
to no resolution.  
</P>
<P>
 No such argument is necessary in Nigeria, where 6-3, 200-pound center forward 
Rashidi Yekini reigns supreme as king of African soccer. Voted Africa's player 
of the year in 1993, Yekini has led three countries in scoring during his 
professional career -- Nigeria, Portugal and the Ivory Coast -- and produced 
eight of Nigeria's 17 goals during World Cup qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 "My business is to score goals," Yekini said after leading Nigeria to the 
African Nations Cup in April. Yekini had five goals in Nigeria's first four 
games in the Nations Cup. Before that, he led the Portuguese League with 18 
goals in 30 games for Setubal. 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland comes to the United States with a goal-scoring howitzer in striker 
Stephane Chapuisat. Chapuisat, 24, accounted for six goals as Switzerland 
qualified for its first World Cup in 28 years and has totaled 51 goals in his 
last three seasons with the German club team Borussia Dortmund. 
</P>
<P>
 And the best player to set foot on American soil this World Cup, at least in 
the consensus of the globe's soccer coaches and media, is Italy's Baggio. Both 
groups named Baggio player of the year in 1993 and Baggio says he plans on 
using this tournament to eliminate all dissenters. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggio spawned nationwide controversy by converting to Buddhism in the bastion 
of Roman Catholicism, a decision that has left Mathilde Baggio with only two 
hopes for her son: 
</P>
<P>
 "That Roberto leads Italy to the World Cup and that he might re-convert." 
</P>
<P>
 Everything about Baggio attracts attention, all the way down to the curly 
black ponytail that bounces on his shoulders as he leads a rush to the net. 
Italians have bestowed a nickname upon the ponytail. "Il Divino Codino," they 
call it. "The Divine Bow." 
</P>
<P>
 They are the world's soccer stars of the here and now, and they are ours, on 
loan, for the next month. Catch them while you can, because their itinerary in 
the United States barely amounts to a stopover. 
</P>
<P>
 Hair today, gone tomorrow.

WORLD CUP USA '94; THINGS TO COME; BRAZIL'S RONALDO MIGHT NOT BE PELE, BUT HE 
(AND OTHERS) PROVIDE A LOOK AT THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pele wrote soccer history with his feet and it all started when he made his 
glittery World Cup debut in 1958 at age 17 in Sweden, guiding Brazil to the 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-six years later, another 17-year-old unknown forward has found himself 
on a team of Brazilian all-stars. He too is known by one name -- Ronaldo. The 
temptation to even mention Pele and Ronaldo in the same sentence has proved 
irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 A soccer sin, apparently. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is one Jesus Christ. There is one Martin Luther King. And there is only 
one Pele," says Alfredo Souza Gama, a radio broadcaster from Recife, who has 
followed Brazilian soccer for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil Coach Carlos Alberto Parreira is nearly as emphatic, saying: "There 
will be not another Pele. The only thing similar they share is that they were 
17 years old in the World Cup. He has his own style." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is true. Ronaldo, who has few problems shaking a defender, has yet to 
shed his braces. He smiles often and his braces shine in the sun, but Ronaldo 
turns a bright shade of red when he is asked when they will be removed. 
</P>
<P>
 "By the end of the year," he says, still blushing. 
</P>
<P>
 Do they hurt? 
</P>
<P>
 Ronaldo recovers his poise and laughs, saying: "Only when I get hit in the 
mouth with a ball." 
</P>
<P>
 The sight of Ronaldo conducting interviews and sharing the practice field with 
the legendary likes of Romario and Bebeto would have been unthinkable a year 
ago. Then, Ronaldo Luiz Nazario de Lima was playing for an obscure 
second-division team, Sao Cristovao. His personal Colonel Parker was Jairzinho, 
a star player on the last Brazilian team to win the World Cup in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 Jairzinho spotted future greatness in the youngster from an impoverished 
background, plucked him out of the minor leagues and got him a deal with 
Cruzeiro in Belo Horizonte. Ronaldo proved to be a deadly goal-scoring machine, 
scoring 55 goals in his first 57 games. He is an ambidextrous threat, equally 
accurate with either foot. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, Ronaldo is being utilized by the Brazilian government as an example 
to his peers. He was recently selected to serve as a spokesman to help get out 
the vote for this fall's presidential elections. Voting is optional for 16 and 
17 year olds. Ronaldo will turn 18 on September 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, in the days before Brazil's World Cup opener against Russia, Ronaldo's 
teammates are supportive and try not to offer intrusive advice. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very unusual and different -- you have to take into account his age," 
midfielder Rai said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Bebeto: "He is here because he has gained the right to be here." 
</P>
<P>
 As you might guess, Ronaldo is not expected to play much during the World Cup. 
At least not as long as Bebeto and Romario remain uninjured. It would seem he 
will be somewhat of an understudy, waiting and watching and learning from his 
elders. 
</P>
<P>
 Naturally, Parreira revealed nothing about his plans for Ronaldo. 
</P>
<P>
 "You never know. We have five strikers and he is one of them. Any one of them 
could play," Parreira said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Ronaldo: "I worked to be here. I am looking for an opportunity to show 
myself, what I can do." 
</P>
<P>
 For Ronaldo, the constant comparisons to Pele don't unnerve him in the least. 
He seems to understand why fans as well as journalists continue to search for 
the next Pele, even though the quest may be futile and unrealistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very proud about it, calm and tranquil about what people are saying 
about me. It doesn't bother me," Ronaldo said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Almost a half-generation ahead of Ronaldo is 25-year-old striker Dennis 
Bergkamp of the Netherlands. Similar to the Jairzhino-Ronaldo connection, 
Bergkamp was "discovered" at age 12 and coached in the exclusive youth club 
Ajax by former Dutch great Johan Cruyff. 
</P>
<P>
 Born and raised in Amsterdam, Bergkamp was named by his father after 
Manchester United and Scotland striker Denis Law. Bergkamp will be forced to 
shoulder more of the scoring load since the Dutch team will be without Marco 
Van Basten and Ruud Gullit, who walked out of training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 Bergkamp, who came into international prominence with his performance at the 
1992 European Championship, left his native country and played for Inter Milan 
in Italy this season. By all accounts, it was anything but easy as Bergkamp 
received an undue amount of criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Bergkamp received partial redemption when he picked up his scoring late 
in the season when the stakes were higher. Bergkamp had decided to leave for 
Italy only when his Ajax teammate Wim Jonk decided to play in Milan. Bergkamp, 
a cool finisher, has been among the elite the last couple of seasons, finishing 
behind only Roberto Baggio of Italy last year and Van Basten in 1992 in World 
Soccer's voting for player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 In Spain, 5-10 midfielder Julen Guerrero of first-division Athletic Bilbao is 
part of what was considered a risky youth movement on the part of outspoken 
coach Javier Clemente. Guerrero, 20, is the second-youngest player to represent 
Spain, behind the legendary Zubieta, who made his national team debut as a 
17-year-old in 1936. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero was voted the most promising prospect in the Spanish league in the 
1992-93 season by Don Balon, the premier soccer publication in Spain. The 
newspaper, El Pais, took a poll of club coaches and named Guerrero the best 
native player this season. And, of course, one true indicator of how highly a 
player is regarded rests in comparison to others. 
</P>
<P>
 Most often, Guerrero is called the Basque Laudrup. Laudrup is Michael Laudrup, 
the star player from Denmark. Guerrero showed a hint of his vast potential a 
year ago when he scored two goals in a four-minute span against Latvia in a Cup 
qualifying match. 
</P>
<P>
 Guerrero, who has scored 28 league goals in two seasons, has other interests 
in addition to soccer. He takes piano classes and is a first-year journalism 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say my best quality is that I'm good at sniffing out goals, if not for 
myself, then for others," Guerrero said in a recent interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has Cobi Jones and his dreadlocks. Colombia has Valderrama, 
who looks like Cousin It from the Addams Family rests on top of his head.  
</P>
<P>
 Interesting hair is not limited to players from North America and South 
America, however. Sweden's Henrik Larsson, a 22-year-old striker, sports 
dreadlocks. Larsson, who plays for Feyenoord in Holland, had an impressive 
six-month stretch, which earned him a spot on the World Cup team. 
</P>
<P>
 Since he has limited international experience, Larsson is not expected to 
start. Should Sweden have problems scoring, however, expect Larsson to come off 
the bench as a late substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 Larsson is swift and possesses good control with a sharpness in the box. 
Already, he has scored a highly significant goal for Sweden. It was on Oct. 13 
against Finland and Larsson's header broke a 1-1 tie and put the Swedes ahead 
for good. Sweden won, 3-2, and Israel's upset over France put the Swedes into 
the World Cup for the second consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 Nikos Machlas, the youngest member of the Greek national team, turned 21 the 
day before the World Cup opened, and already he is something of a veteran. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's mature," said Gregory Zikos, liaison for the Greek team. "Nikos is not 
spoiled. He's not a typical 21-year-old who thinks he has the world at his 
feet."  
</P>
<P>
 Possessing an impressive pedigree, the striker followed in his father George's 
path and joined OFI Crete at age 17 and has played almost 100 matches in 
Greece's first division. 
</P>
<P>
 He scored in his national team debut and his second goal was the winning goal 
in Greece's 1-0 victory over Russia, which secured first place in Group 5 World 
Cup qualifying. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing celebration -- massive fireworks -- turned the stadium into a 
smoke chamber and the game was temporarily suspended because no one could see 
anything on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 In the World Cup, Machlas is expected to be seen.

WORLD CUP USA '94; A LAST LOOK; LOVE THEM OR LEAVE THEM, VETERANS GET ANOTHER 
SHOT AT THE SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT ALMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One soccer reporter had this to say about Diego Maradona: 
</P>
<P>
 "Now 33, back playing in Argentina and supposedly rehabilitated, if he comes 
he's as likely to be a disruptive influence as an inspiration; I'd leave him 
out (of the World Cup) because the shadows some heroes cast can get too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Switzerland's Andy Egli, 36, felt the sting of similar sentiment when a Swiss 
newspaper polled 6,000 readers last January and found 79% favored dropping the 
weak-kneed defender from the national team. 
</P>
<P>
 But Maradona and Egli survived such indignation and now are but two of 
soccer's grizzled and chiseled veterans who are perhaps paying their last 
respects to World Cup competition. 
</P>
<P>
 The monthlong event could see the final Cup performances of such stars as 
Roger Milla of Cameroon, Lothar Matthaeus of Germany, Franco Baresi of Italy, 
Ronald Koeman of the Netherlands, Sergio Goycochea of Argentina, Gheorghe Hagi 
of Romania and Hugo Sanchez of Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Their names represent a mixture of emotions, from adoration to ad nauseam. But 
now that the world's biggest sporting event has finally dropped in on Main 
Street America, they are not about to miss the extravaganza even as others 
suggest they should. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an awkward situation," said Sunil Gulati, an executive vice president of 
World Cup USA '94. "There's always a series of stars playing in their last Cup. 
There's a sadness to that. But we also look with anticipation to future stars." 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Bob Dylan might say, "Don't look back." 
</P>
<P>
 It is an attitude whose current flows strong among the sport's disciples. Yet, 
before some of those with the longest of shadows are totally discarded, they 
will play an important role in World Cup '94. 
</P>
<P>
 What will be missed in 1998 when France plays host to the tournament? 
</P>
<P>
 "Their flashiness," said Cle Kooiman, a U.S. defender who plays in Mexico. 
"These guys are brilliant on the field. Without them, you tend to have a 
regular soccer game, 11 against 11. 
</P>
<P>
 "But when you are playing against Maradona, you're playing 14 against 11. This 
guy has the touch of three guys put together." 
</P>
<P>
 Kooiman might be waxing soccer poetic, but he expresses the community's 
infatuation with brilliance. Like once-proud matadors, the old warriors who 
continue playing with diminished skills arouse great expectations. Soccer is 
such an unforgiving sport that fans demand nothing less than excellence. 
</P>
<P>
 Or else. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no graceful exit from this quandary except the improbable route of 
duplicating past feats. Yet, some continue despite themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Matthaeus, who joined the German national team in 1980 as a teen-age defender, 
has had twice the career of most mortals. At 33, he could have retired as one 
of the world's greatest. Instead, he began playing in his fourth World Cup 
Friday in Chicago. After his outstanding season in the German Bundesliga this 
year, who could blame him? 
</P>
<P>
 "I assume when I finish my career that I won't be able to walk normally 
anymore and that my body will be used up," he said earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 He was serious. Two years ago, he suffered a severe knee injury, yet trained 
to compete in another World Cup for the defending champions. Coach Berti Vogts, 
who moved his star from midfield to sweeper with good results, was relieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogts has brought a veteran team to the United States because he believes 
these players will know how to preserve their strength and stamina playing in 
extremely hot and humid conditions in Chicago and Dallas in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We probably would not be writing about Milla, 42, if not for a presidential 
decree in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Milla become entangled in a fight between Cameroon soccer fans and soccer 
officials who four years ago assumed that Milla was too old for World Cup 
competition. The country's president, sensing a political coup, interceded by 
siding with the fans. They were insisting that Milla, the soul of Cameroon 
soccer, be allowed to compete one more time. 
</P>
<P>
 Smart move. Milla emerged as one of soccer's stars from Italia '90. And now 
he's back with another presidential order. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest president, Paul Biya, contributed $185,000 to the team, and 
persuaded Coach Henri Michel to allow Milla to join the team again. 
</P>
<P>
 Such circumstances have caused Guido Tognoni of FIFA, soccer's world governing 
body, to pause. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never say goodby in a World Cup," Tognoni said. "They might come again." 
</P>
<P>
 And, like Milla, again. 
</P>
<P>
 But Tognoni and other officials are more interested in who will emerge than in 
who is leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that sentimental," Tognoni said of seeing some big names for the 
last time. "In soccer, you win as a team, lose as a team." 
</P>
<P>
 That's the official point of view. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the players think otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like an honor almost to go out and be involved in the same World Cup 
with Diego Maradona or somebody you've watched growing up," said Juergen 
Sommer, a U.S. goalkeeper who plays in the English first division. 
</P>
<P>
 "In a way, it's kind of sad to see that (Maradona) has reached the age where 
he can't compete internationally at this level anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 But he is still Maradona, and despite being out of shape with diminished 
skills, there is always a chance he will exploit a defense with his footwork, 
if only for a moment. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Baresis, Koemans and other established stars in their 30s can not be 
easily discounted. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can add something to your team, you should be there," said Kooiman, 
the U.S. defender who has seen first-hand what a veteran such as Sanchez, 34, 
can do at an advanced age. 
</P>
<P>
 "Inside the (penalty) area, the guy is deadly," Kooiman said. "Many forwards 
need to touch the ball three or four times before they can get the ball off. He 
does everything first touch and tends to surprise the goalie." 
</P>
<P>
 And what Sanchez lacks in youthful spirit, he compensates for with guile. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a big talker on the field to get defenders out of their game," Kooiman 
said. "Usually, it's the other way around. (But) a lot of defenders lose their 
frames of mind and go crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes that in itself is as brilliant as dribbling through the defense 
to set up a score.

WORLD CUP USA '94; COMMENTARY; DON'T LAUGH: NOW IS SOCCER'S CHANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The hands-off approach to the sport of soccer has always been fashionable in 
this country, whether you are the sports editor of a large newspaper or the guy 
at the corner bar, snarling epithets about long-haired foreigners. 
</P>
<P>
 What American sports fans don't know, they make fun of. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's very possible that after the conclusion of the monthlong World Cup 
extravaganza we began Friday -- after 24 of the world's best teams showcase 
their sport in 52 games in nine cities in front of nearly 4 million on-site 
spectators -- American sports fans will have a further shift in emotion about 
soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 They might openly detest it. 
</P>
<P>
 But soccer has a favorite phrase about all this. It says: Five billion people 
can't be wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 For Americans, it is a little like the mother who goes to watch her son march 
in the military parade. Every time the rest of the soldiers step right, her son 
steps left. To those around her, the mother explains, loudly and proudly, that 
all those other marchers are wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 If United States sports fans are truly out of step with the rest of the world 
on this soccer issue, two things are clear: 
</P>
<P>
 -- They are loud and proud about their dissent. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The only real chance soccer has to change this is happening right now. 
</P>
<P>
 As we all heard, ad nauseam, soccer was to be the Sport of the '60s, then of 
the '70s, and the '80s. In effect, it disappeared for general-interest purposes 
with the death of the North American Soccer League -- featuring Pele, the 
Cosmos and occasional huge crowds -- in 1984. 
</P>
<P>
 So, can something basically dead and buried for 10 years be teased into 
resurrection by a one-month traveling carnival? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes it can, at least for the short term. And for three reasons: Change of 
pace, sex and passion. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Change of pace is easy to explain: 
</P>
<P>
 American sports fans need one. They are saturated by lengthy seasons, greedy 
owners and surly athletes. They've read the same stupid quotes from the same 
mindless athletes reported by the same bored sportswriters on the same 
predictable sports pages for way too long. They are at the point where they 
think a night in front of the tube, watching SportsCenter, is as good as it 
gets. They might be within one more player strike, or one more Darryl 
Strawberry comeback, or dashing off screaming into the night. Or worse, 
starting to watch the Home Shopping Network. Indeed, the fact that soccer is 
totally foreign to most might be the best thing it has going for it right now. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sex, or make that thighs: 
</P>
<P>
 During the Mexico-USA tuneup soccer match on June 4 at the Rose Bowl, two 
female sportswriters were overheard discussing the fact that soccer players, 
because of all the running they must do, have wonderfully toned thighs. They 
discussed this while peering through binoculars. They peered for a very long 
time, eventually raising the question of whether binoculars embedded in 
foreheads can be removed surgically. Since females historically control much of 
the television watching habits in the home, the TV ratings people might be in 
for a pleasant surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Soccer and passion, almost synonymous: 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Gardner writes in his book, "The Simplest Game," about his trip to 
Wembley Stadium in 1953 and his passion for Blackpool star Stan Matthews, who 
turned out to be the hero of a dramatic victory over Bolton. Of Matthews, 
Gardner writes: "At his feet, the ball was at home, comfortably nestling in 
absolute security, caressed with soft little touches as Stan shuffled his bowed 
legs toward yet another hapless fullback." Gardner's emotion is no less intense 
than Roger Kahn's for baseball and for his Boys of Summer. 
</P>
<P>
 A 17-year-old, Martijn van der Steen, from Vlaardingen, Norway, writes the 
sports editor of the Los Angeles Times. His is perhaps the 70th such letter 
received in recent months from foreign writers, or aspiring foreign writers, 
wanting an American outlet to both give them close-up access to the sport they 
love and a place where their love affair can be showcased in print. "I have 
been following soccer ever since I was able to read and watch TV," the young 
Norwegian writes, pleading his case. 
</P>
<P>
 An 87-year-old Mexican, Jose Guadalupe Vargas of Guadalajara, a former coach 
in the top-division Mexican soccer leagues, learns that his daughter will be a 
translator for an American newspaper and that she will see many games. In his 
fraternal excitement and pride, he sends her a series of four-page, 
single-spaced, hand-written letters to make sure she fully understands what she 
is about to see. They arrive, day after day, by Federal Express. And the wisdom 
of his 87 years shows. "The losing team never talks afterward, and they always 
blame the referees," he writes. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, the challenge soccer faces in winning over America is no small one. 
United States sportswriters tend to lead the way by being smug about all that 
is different, all that is out of their comfort zone. Upon arrival at the 1988 
Olympics in Seoul, one of the first destinations for many United States 
columnists was any local restaurant that served dog meat. They went, munched 
and yukked it up for the readers back home. In 1992 in Barcelona, much sport 
was made of the local practice of eating dinner at 11 p.m. It was foreign, 
therefore it was funny. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of soccer not being violent enough for American fans' tastes might 
be solved early, when TV replays show the action in front of the net off a 
corner kick. There is usually enough kicking, holding and gouging to make John 
Starks jealous. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of low scoring might never be solved. As David Brooks wrote recently 
in the Wall Street Journal: "When a goal actually does come, it only seems so 
magnificent because the rest of the game is so terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the hooligan issue. If it crops up, it could greatly 
influence the final American perception of World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 That should not, however, be a problem in Los Angeles. If the hooligans run 
wild here, everybody will think they are Raider fans.

WORLD CUP USA '94; COMMENTARY; GOOD TICKETS LIKE CREDIT CARDS -- THERE ARE 
LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN CHAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Norman Chad, who has written for the 
National and Sports Illustrated, will be writing a series of stories for the 
World Cup '94 Special Reports. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I wanted good World Cup tickets. I wanted them in an instant. I wanted them 
from the comfort of my couch. 
</P>
<P>
 No way, the skeptics scolded me, I should have ordered them months ago, like 
every other average Joe and corporate pro. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, right. 
</P>
<P>
 Let me tell you folks something about this country: This is America. In 
America, no matter who you are or where you come from, if you have enough 
desire and fortitude and perseverance and strength and enterprise and will and 
determination and ambition and doggedness and tenacity and resolution and 
diligence and heart and you know the number and expiration date of your credit 
card, you can get anything you want. 
</P>
<P>
 And let me remind you folks of something else, an adage that dates back to the 
days of Aristotle: "Anything you ever need, from basketballs to brick walls, 
all it takes is just two phone calls." 
</P>
<P>
 Tickets were there to be had, that's for sure. In Friday's Times alone, for 
instance, there were more than 125 classified ads offering World Cup seats. (By 
contrast, there were only seven ads offering used Cessna airplanes.) So it 
seemed to me it was a buyer's market. 
</P>
<P>
 I had a plan: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Call 800 numbers first. I figured good tickets might be pricey, so it would 
be nice to save a little cash with some toll-free phone action. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Concentrate on games at the Rose Bowl, partly because it's the best soccer 
venue in the country, partly because it has the largest capacity of any World 
Cup site and partly because it's a lot closer to my West Hollywood home than 
the other eight World Cup stadiums. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Target good tickets only. Why pay top dollar to sit your bottom in seats in 
which the soccer ball looks more like a Super Ball? Note: When I say "good 
tickets," this excludes any seat at Tuesday's Nigeria-Bulgaria game in Dallas, 
where tickets are still widely available in all price ranges pretty much 
through halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 On my first call, I got a busy signal. (This put my two-call theory 
immediately in doubt.) 
</P>
<P>
 On my second call, I got put on hold and was forced to listen to "Radar Love" 
by Golden Earring as I waited. Next. 
</P>
<P>
 On my third call, I got put on hold again and the Muzak this time was Meat 
Loaf. No. 
</P>
<P>
 On my fourth call, I got another busy signal. 
</P>
<P>
 On my fifth call, I dialed Domino's and ordered a pepperoni pizza. I figured 
it was going to be a long day. Plus, Domino's would sooner make their drivers 
pick up hitchhikers than put somebody on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 On my sixth call, I finally made my first contact. I asked for U.S.-Colombia 
tickets at the Rose Bowl on Wednesday. Category 3 tickets were $175 each, 
Category 2 were $200 and Category 1 $250. I reached for my wallet, but it 
instinctively had crawled away. 
</P>
<P>
 On my next call, U.S.-Colombia tickets were priced at $125, $150 and $200. 
This was a small step toward a reasonable economic goal, but it still pained me 
to realize that had I ordered tickets by mail months ago as part of a five-game 
package, the categories were priced at $25.50, $41 or $55 per game. 
</P>
<P>
 On my next five calls, two ticket agencies had nothing available for any U.S. 
game and three other brokers offered seats from $90 to $225. At this point, I 
kept staring at a newspaper ad I had saved for a car dealership in Costa Mesa 
-- "Win World Cup Final Tickets! Come In and Register to Win 2 Tickets for the 
World Cup Finals!" -- but I wasn't in that 405 mood. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I found an agency offering a Category 3 U.S.-Colombia seat for $45. 
That's right -- only $45! Where are the seats, in Glendale? 
</P>
<P>
 When I checked on tickets for the June 26 U.S.-Romania game at the Rose Bowl, 
an agent said, "I'm out of those right now, but I might get some in later 
today." What, is this, like the produce truck that arrives with fresh berries 
and melon at 4 o'clock? 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, what you've got to understand is that we buy and sell all day long," 
said Jerry Langston of Chicago-based HotTix. "One minute I can't do anything 
for you on Italy-Ireland, then an hour later I may get a block of 10. I'll 
always tell people to check back or I take their name." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, although 97% of the World Cup's 3.5 million tickets had been sold by 
Friday, seemingly most of them were still on sale at the right price. In fact, 
I don't think anyone is actually going to be in the stadiums for these games. 
Rather, there will be 50,000 people wandering the parking lots holding up 
signs, "Need Two," and another 50,000 wandering nearby with signs, "Have Two." 
</P>
<P>
 I kept making calls. I kept getting put on hold, sometimes with Michael 
Bolton. (Doesn't anyone play Mel Torme anymore?) 
</P>
<P>
 My next few calls for U.S.-Colombia yielded prices again in the $200 range. 
</P>
<P>
 So I came up with a new plan -- Italy-Mexico at RFK Stadium in Washington on 
June 28. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad plan. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, I've got a better chance of taking the Statue of Liberty to 
Times Square on New Year's Eve than getting into RFK for that game. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a tough one," Tri-Tickets Agency told me. "Washington's a tough, tough 
ticket." 
</P>
<P>
 So I went to the Pele of ticket brokers, Murray's Tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Murray's had two Category 1 seats available for Italy-Mexico at $1,250 each. 
That's twelve hundred fifty U.S. dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 What, Streisand singing both national anthems? 
</P>
<P>
 Frankly, I thought things were getting a bit steep. Sure, I've got deep 
pockets, but mostly they have lint in them. 
</P>
<P>
 I returned to my U.S.-Colombia pursuit for Wednesday, but now I couldn't find 
anything under $85. Meanwhile, my wallet had gotten a court order putting it 
into protective custody. 
</P>
<P>
 All of which led me to an easy decision: I'll just go watch the Anaheim Splash 
play the Detroit Neon in indoor soccer Wednesday at The Pond of Anaheim. It's 
"Poster Night" and tickets are priced at $12, $10, $8 and $6, which gives me 
enough money left over to buy a used Cessna.

WHERE OUR TROUBLES BEGAN; IN THE MOST OLD-FASHIONED OF HIS HISTORICAL NOVELS, 
E. L. DOCTOROW PARADOXICALLY COMMENTS MOST DIRECTLY ON THE DARKNESS OF OUR 
MODERN WORLD.; THE WATERWORKS, BY E. L. DOCTOROW (RANDOM HOUSE: $23; 253 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jonathan Franzen, Jonathan Franzen's novels are Strong Motion and The 
Twenty-Seventh City. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The imaginative universe of E. L. Doctorow is as unbounded in time as it is 
spatially restricted by his love and hatred of New York. He travels through 
history by means of inference, from old buildings. His characters are like 
genies conjured up by the mental stroking of New York City landmarks -- the 
Morgan Library in "Ragtime," Bathgate Avenue in "Billy Bathgate," the 
fairgrounds in "World's Fair," P.S. 70 in "The Book of Daniel." 
</P>
<P>
 His new book, "The Waterworks," seems to have been inspired by the reservoir 
and dam at Croton, just north of New York City. (I venture this guess in part 
because Croton appears in the book and in part because I've been there myself. 
I've looked out on the imposing dam, the impounded water and I've had the 
thought: There's a novel here.) 
</P>
<P>
 Doctorow has found the novel not in any realistic history of the waterworks 
but in their mythic being, their symbolic pairing of nature's immensity and 
civilization's presumption. What makes Doctorow our most exciting historical 
novelist, aside from sheer talent and audacity, is his perception that history 
can only be reconstructed, never re-experienced. However anxious a character 
named Eisenhower may be on the eve of D-day, it's hard for readers in 1994 to 
share in his suspense. Hindsight inevitably estranges us from historical 
figures, punctures the illusion of their free will, and so undermines the sense 
of identification on which realism depends. This is why Doctorow's best novels 
("Ragtime," "Billy Bathgate") aspire less to be imitations of life than to be 
sophisticated toys for grownups. 
</P>
<P>
 The setting of "The Waterworks" is New York City in 1871. The industrialized 
North has recently won the Civil War, and Boss Tweed and his ring are milking a 
metropolis financially engorged by victory. "Almost a million people called New 
York home, everyone securing his needs in a state of cheerful degeneracy. 
Nowhere else in the world was there such an acceleration of energies. A mansion 
would appear in a field. The next day it stood on a city street with horse and 
carriage riding by." 
</P>
<P>
 The narrator of the novel, whose voice is heard here, is a newspaper editor 
named McIlvaine, a man whose poetic gifts do interesting battle with his 
rationalism. In lieu of children, the unmarried McIlvaine has a "clutch" of 
free-lance writers, and one afternoon his favorite of them, an angry young man 
named Martin Pemberton, comes into the newspaper office with a bloodied face 
and torn shirt and says: "He's alive . . . my father, Augustus Pemberton. He is 
alive." 
</P>
<P>
 McIlvaine the rationalist knows that Augustus Pemberton, a vilely wealthy 
wartime profiteer and former slave trader, has been dead and buried for half a 
year. He shrugs off the son's words as "a poetic way of characterizing the 
wretched city that neither of us loved, but neither of us could leave." Soon 
enough, however, Martin vanishes from New York. The story he leaves behind with 
friends contains the first of the series of powerful images that together form 
the novel's mainspring. 
</P>
<P>
 In roaming lower Manhattan in a rainstorm, it seems, Martin has caught sight 
of a horse-drawn city omnibus occupied by six somber men in black coats and 
black top hats. "They are old men, or ill enough to look old, and eerily 
unmindful of the world." One of them, from the egg-like wen on the back of his 
neck, Martin identifies positively as his father. 
</P>
<P>
 Lest there be any doubt about the young man's sanity, we learn that the same 
thing has happened a second time, on 42nd Street during a snowstorm. Again a 
public conveyance, again the men in black. And again a glimpse of old Augustus, 
"who at the same moment turns an incurious gaze upon (Martin). A moment later 
the entire equipage is swallowed up by the storm." 
</P>
<P>
 These twin sightings, with their Gothic atmospherics, set the novel's 
machinery in motion. To reveal more of the story would spoil the book's main 
pleasure, which consists of McIlvaine's investigation of Martin's 
disappearance, the alternate confounding and confirming of his rationalism. 
"The Waterworks" is a detective quest of exceptional single-mindedness. 
</P>
<P>
 Exceptional, and in some ways lamentable. Readers of this book will wait in 
vain for the irony and sensuality of "Ragtime," the sumptuous prose and vivid 
characters of "Billy Bathgate," the viscerality of "The Book of Daniel." 
Despite the occasional anachronism (my Webster's has him using intelligentsia 
35 years too early), the novel is notable for sounding genuinely old-fashioned. 
The author achieves a woodenness of character reminiscent of William Dean 
Howells, and the narration tends, like much of Wilkie Collins, to be both 
laborious and overheated. 
</P>
<P>
 The pages are weighted with unnecessary recapitulations and heavy-handed 
underlings of abstract themes. There are several thousand sets of portentous 
ellipses, in passages like this: "I had staked out my claim to a story, in 
effect negotiating with the police for my rights in it . . . but, after all, 
how phantom it was . . . no more than a hope for words on a page . . . 
insubstantial words . . . phantom names. . . ." Everywhere, you get the sense 
of an author who has despaired of showing and begun to tell. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, and yet -- what a kicker of an insanely dark secret Doctorow has 
planted at the center of his machine! Despite the novel's Gothic rhetoric and 
rhythms and allegorical transparency, the ultimate shock to McIlvaine's 
ordering of the world comes not from any supernatural horror but from the 
vastness and modernity of the urban conspiracy that he unearths. Doctorow is 
pointing less to Transylvania than to Auschwitz when McIlvaine, near the 
novel's climax, speaks of feeling "not fear or dread . . . but a desolate 
bleakness." A few pages later he speaks again of being "haunted . . . not by 
ghosts, but by Science." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently any universe both finite and unbounded, even an imaginative one, 
exhibits paradoxes of curvature. Following the history of modern New York back 
to its earliest limits, to a time when Central Park and the Brooklyn Bridge are 
works in progress, we find ourselves emerging into a world more 
late-20th-Century than any Doctorow has written about before. Evil old Augustus 
Pemberton, with his "loyalty not to any one business, but to the art of buying 
and selling them," could be Donald Trump or T. Boone Pickens. The twistedness 
of every father-son relationship in the book, the depiction of industry's 
orphaning of an entire generation, amounts to a refreshingly hard-core Marxist 
comment on the contemporary breakdown of the family. And the novel as a whole 
bears with uncanny directness on, of all things, our country's health-care 
crisis in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The longueurs and fascinations of "The Waterworks" are those of a toy whose 
colorful casings have been removed. We're given the austere spectacle of shiny 
gears and naked symbols; also the tedium of a toy that leaves little to the 
imagination; and finally the mystery that a thing so frankly contrived can 
still affect us. Uningratiating but visionary, the book invites us to peer back 
to the verge of modern industrial society -- and shows us ourselves peering 
forward.

TELEVISION; WHY THE STAND-UP ROUTINE WORKS; HOW MANY NETWORK EXECS DOES IT TAKE 
TO MAKE A HIT SITCOM? JUST THE ONE LUCKY ENOUGH TO FIND THE NEXT SEINFELD OR 
ROSEANNE. STAND-UP COMICS ARE TODAY'S HITMAKERS. BUT HOW DOES THAT DIFFER FROM 
TV'S PAST? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, Lawrence Christon is a Times staff writer. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a forlorn young woman in Thomas Pynchon's "Vineland" wished that life 
could be like a sitcom, with a wisecrack for every occasion and all of its 
problems wrapped up in 30 minutes -- cut to final commercial -- she didn't know 
how accommodating the television industry would eventually be. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, anyone can take a Voyager-length trip through the empyrean reaches 
of sitcom syndication, with orbital laugh tracks beaming out from "I Love 
Lucy," "Gilligan's Island," "Family Ties," "Cheers" and "Empty Nest," among 
numerous others, and never touch down in a world that isn't swaddled in yuks 
(and we haven't even veered into cable). 
</P>
<P>
 Dave and Jay will ease us out of catastrophic news reports and into the night 
with choice quips and the celebrity fix to show us that life can be beautiful 
for at least some of us. 
</P>
<P>
 The sitcom reorders the world altogether. A pretense of normality, someone's 
zany entrance, a comic misunderstanding, a few jokes to ease everyone toward 
reconciliation -- and calm is restored until the next episode. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the professionally embalmed, it's incorruptible. It's where everyone's 
glad to see you and knows your name. The Huxtables will point a moral for you. 
Roseanne's house may be locked in the humid anguish and cheap smells of a 
school cafeteria, and its continuing familial beefs may hang in the air like 
razor wire, but you'll never be denied a place at the table. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the downsized '90s, the sitcom is taking a new turn. Where once 
comedic actors like Dick Van Dyke and longtime comedy pros like Bob Newhart 
headlined their own shows, now relatively unknown stand-up comedians are coming 
out of the clubs into prime time, bringing with them new adoptive families and 
friends and '90s attitudes of ironic diffidence and diminished expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at the ratings. For the prime-time season that just ended, five of the 
six most popular shows were sitcoms that starred stand-up comics ("60 Minutes" 
was the lone exception). Tim Allen heads the No. 1-rated "Home Improvement" and 
Jerry Seinfeld is in the No. 3-rated "Seinfeld." Roseanne Arnold in "Roseanne" 
finished fourth, followed by "These Friends of Mine," which stars Ellen 
DeGeneres, and "Grace Under Fire," featuring Brett Butler. 
</P>
<P>
 Network executives, part of whose survival depends on staying ahead of the 
curve, haven't been waiting around to see if the trend is just a passing fad. 
This spring they ordered pilots starring Rita Rudner, Rick Duccommun, Jeff 
Wayne, Howie Mandel, Carlos Mencia, Lewis Black and Lisa Ann Walter, among 
others. And while none of those made the cut for fall, two others did, both at 
ABC: Steve Harvey will play a dad in "Me and the Boys" and Korean American 
Margaret Cho stars as a woman aspiring to be the "All American Girl." 
</P>
<P>
 The fall lineup will also carry a number of familiar faces of comedic actors 
-- including Dabney Coleman, Martin Short, Hal Linden and Suzanne Pleshette -- 
but no one challenges the notion that the stand-up-to-sitcom transition is a 
fait accompli.  
</P>
<P>
 "The search for the good stand-up comedian to base a series on is ultimately 
about finding the next big hit," says Sandy Grushow, president of the Fox 
Entertainment Group. "What the good ones bring is a distinctive point of view, 
like Martin Lawrence, who had something to say before he ever got to his sitcom 
(Fox's "Martin")." 
</P>
<P>
 Says NBC Entertainment President Warren Littlefield: "Comics stand in 
five-hour-a-night lineups all over the country. They have to earn their keep by 
being distinctive in some way. When television goes from 10 channels to 35, 
then 60, and with the upcoming information superhighway, 500, it's to your 
advantage to bring in someone who's already discovered how to be memorable." 
</P>
<P>
 The formula for successfully shaping a show around a comic's attitudes and 
persona is by no means guaranteed, as Richard Lewis and Don Rickles will tell 
you after "Daddy Dearest," or Tom Arnold will tell you after two strikeouts -- 
even as Roseanne Arnold gives new meaning to the phrase "significant other." 
They were part of last season's casualty list, which included fellow stand-ups 
Sinbad, Thea Vitale and John Mendoza. 
</P>
<P>
 But the successes have been spectacular, producing hundreds of millions of 
dollars in revenue for networks, producers and stars (Bill Cosby's syndication 
deals for "The Cosby Show" alone earned him more money than the gross domestic 
product of some Third World countries). 
</P>
<P>
 "NBC didn't think that highly of 'Seinfeld' at first and stuck it in a summer 
slot, figuring no one would watch it," says David Steinberg, who as actor, 
writer, producer and director has touched all points of the TV comedy compass. 
"Now a number of execs are saying they knew it'd be a hit all along and have 
moved up into expensive homes." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're seeing the continuation of the cycle that began when so many 
stand-up comics surfaced through the '80s," says Garry Shandling, star of HBO's 
"The Larry Sanders Show." "The peak of the stand-up era is over. The clubs are 
having a tough time economically. The comedians have to move on. Sitcoms are 
giving them an opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 The sitcom's differing incarnations have been drawn from a surrounding 
cultural atmosphere. Early on, with players like Molly Berg and Burns & Allen, 
it was a nostalgic carry-over from radio days. "Father Knows Best" summed up 
the white, orderly middle-class 1950s, where Dad never took off his tie. "All 
in the Family" recorded the '60s tectonic grind between generations. Mary Tyler 
Moore exemplified the feminist assertion that a single working girl can do very 
well on her own, thank you. Bill Cosby rose with Ronald Reagan's Morning in 
America sun . Roseanne and Dan Conner worked grimly through the long minimum - 
wage hours of the decade's twilight. 
</P>
<P>
 What of prime-time stand-ups in the '90s? "Roseanne" still bares the fresh 
bruises of modern familial life and its confusions; its jokes are yelps of 
pain. "Home Improvement's" light veneer of sophistication is based on a central 
character who's flawed, like everyone else (though more impulsive about it), 
but is not a complete fool; there's a basic level of good-natured tolerance at 
its core. But these shows don't quite feel like the '90s, at least not like 
"Seinfeld" or "These Friends of Mine," which has been retitled "Ellen" for the 
fall. (Butler of "Grace Under Fire" is soul sister to Roseanne.) 
</P>
<P>
 Do Seinfeld's and DeGeneres' comic instincts accurately clue us in to a widely 
shared experience that makes us a little less lonely in the dark surrounding 
the tube? Or do they signally bring us a narrow generational slice of 
characters with little in mind, peculiarly insular people to whom getting a 
table in a Chinese restaurant is a major issue and sleeping with a virtual 
stranger or dumping someone is no issue at all? And as performers, are they 
representative of our new Age of the Amateur, where no one needs traditional 
training and performance skills to get by? Whatever you want to say of 
newcomers Margaret Cho and Steve Harvey, they are not fine actors. 
</P>
<P>
 These are important concerns to some industry pros. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a plus and a negative to all this," says writer-producer Matt 
Williams, who worked on "The Cosby Show," was the creator of "Roseanne" and is 
the driving force behind "Home Improvement." 
</P>
<P>
 "The plus is that, to fill that half-hour, you need people who understand 
comedy and comedy changes. Good comedians already bring their sense of timing, 
delivery, attitude. The negative is that, with rare exceptions, they're not 
actors. So what often happens is that you get comic delivery instead of capable 
acting. A lot of shows have failed, not only for that reason, but because the 
stand-up hasn't brought a point of view you can build a show around. 
</P>
<P>
 "Creating a successful sitcom is like building a basketball team," Williams 
continued. "Even if you have a Michael Jordan, you need a team around him. The 
good sitcom team builds on the comedian's persona and point of view. But he or 
she still has to be able to act, or to generate action. To stand and deliver 
observational material isn't the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is concerned over the drift that some of the newer sitcoms are taking 
-- that is, abandoning character in deference to attitude: "The best sitcoms 
have always been about human beings and what happens between them. Now it's 
someone saying, 'Huh?' People are smugly detached, unwilling to care, to 
commit, to feel passionate about something. A lot of the half-hour shows have 
people who ignore consequences, as if to say, 'I'm not responsible.' The 
average household watches 50 hours of TV a week and considers what it sees 
acceptable behavior. Can you imagine Mary Tyler Moore saying, 'I'll just screw 
this guy on my first date?' " (This is in reference to the first-episode 
premise of "These Friends of Mine.") 
</P>
<P>
 Writer-producer Robert Weide ("Mastergate" and the Emmy-winning "W.C. Fields 
Straight Up") has mixed feelings about the sitcom's new trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a sitcom series, you need good writing and the dynamic of an ensemble," 
he says. "Jerry Seinfeld is an entertaining comic with a small vision. He's not 
a good actor. But he's likable. The show has all these interesting characters, 
and a lot of people of my generation (Weide is 34) relate to it because of 
their relationships and how they think -- like how George and Jerry scheme to 
meet women. When it's well-written, it holds you. When the writing stops, you 
notice it." 
</P>
<P>
 As an expression of the emerging '90s sensibility, Weide concedes of the 
characters on "Seinfeld," "their lives are kind of shabby. I'm embarrassed to 
relate to the show because of its small thinking. Whole episodes are dedicated 
to things like finding your car in a parking lot. 'All in the Family' dealt 
with issues. Now it's about personal matters." 
</P>
<P>
 David Steinberg cites another, less obvious factor that could be juicing the 
trend along, which relates as much to corporate politics as it does to the 
emergence of a new genre of artist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing at all about being a comedian is amenable to being a comedy actor in 
a sitcom," Steinberg says. "And there are some comic actors who are funnier 
than the comics themselves, like Robin Bartlett, who's not a stand-up comic. Or 
Judith Ivey, who can't not be funny. But it gets the pressure off the backs of 
the execs. If someone comes along who's not a proven commodity, and fails, they 
can say, 'Everyone says he's so funny and it didn't happen.' It's less damaging 
to them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Cosby and Roseanne Arnold came up with monster successes that showed if 
you get the right combination, you can explode. The networks stand to make 
$200-400 million in revenues from shows like those." 
</P>
<P>
 But that also creates pressure in the networks' corporate hierarchies to look 
for the formula that can replicate those successes. 
</P>
<P>
 George Carlin of Fox's "The George Carlin Show" considers the trend one of 
supply and demand. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greatest demand TV has had historically is for comedy shows," Carlin 
says. "Now the supply of comedians has increased. Through the clubs and cable, 
a lot of people have risen to visibility. TV has seen them as another way to 
go. Most of the older sitcoms were based on premise. Now, more and more, you 
get the person and then develop the premise." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlin doesn't see the sitcom as a metaphor for community, unlike other 
critical observers, but he acknowledges that the better ones are not easy to 
do. "It's commerce, pure and simple. It has nothing to do with art and little 
to do with entertainment. It's just to sell biscuits. The important thing is 
that you keep control and you have a good team around you, or else you can get 
lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Garry Shandling is also mindful of the deadly serious pressures that surround 
what for the viewer is mostly 22 minutes of laughter and escape. As a 
successful stand-up who began writing for "Sanford and Son" in 1976, and later 
for Gabe Kaplan and Danny Thomas, Shandling was in line for a show of his own, 
and at first resisted. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the early '80s, I was still exploring who I was comedically; I didn't want 
to be forced into a mold that wasn't me," he says. "I didn't want anything with 
kids and dogs. At one time I had a development deal with NBC. I had already 
been an experienced sitcom writer. The pressures to fit into a mold were 
enormous. That's why I think shows like 'Seinfeld' and 'Roseanne' deserve 
enormous credit for holding on to their point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the ironies of the current trend is that, where television is 
apparently drawing more and more on the fresh blood of stand-up comedians, most 
of the comedians themselves, generationally speaking, have come from television 
-- that is, the almighty wet nurse that Howard Beale railed against in 
"Network" when he charged to a studio audience, "You eat television, you dress 
television, you are television!" 
</P>
<P>
 But there may be a growing intuition within the creative end of the industry 
that the sitcom needs to step up to another level to stand out in a growing 
field of competition, and the best stand-ups, whose profession requires 
fearlessness as well as an alertness to social nuance, are helping shake it 
loose. 
</P>
<P>
 There will always be the use and maybe the necessity for the sitcom to 
continue as a kind of video Prozac, but if "NYPD Blue" and "Prime Suspect" can 
bring a darker, subway-rumbling vibration to the cop genre, the re-conceived 
sitcom can refresh our sense of community by allowing some of the acrid fumes 
and anxious sweats of the real world into a tradition of spotless interiors. 
"Roseanne" showed a beginning, and Brett Butler's low-frequency surliness is a 
continuing rebuke to the relentless forces out there that grind a single 
working mother down. 
</P>
<P>
 Too, the fallout from the '80s comedy boom has sifted through the culture, 
pollinating it with jokes. The front sections of news magazines now look like 
visual equivalents of late-night monologues. Right now, the sensibility coming 
out of the new sitcoms is a mixed bag. Part of it is the junk-food product of a 
smug generation characterized by Garrison Keillor as being "all nostalgia and 
no history," of shared ironic attitudes with no known possession of worldly 
knowledge. But part of it is closer to the bone, to an everyday American 
reality that the better comics bring in from a life on the road, the 
disappearing world beyond television.

EL RESCATE REDEFINES ITS MISSION; DIRECTOR'S DEPARTURE PUTS CENTRAL AMERICAN 
ASSISTANCE AGENCY AT A CROSSROADS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SANDRA HERNANDEZ, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just months after his group emerged from one of the worst financial crises in 
its history, the executive director of El Rescate announced his departure, 
setting off a months-long search for new leadership and a new image. 
</P>
<P>
 Last November, Oscar Andrade, 34, announced he was leaving the social service 
agency to return to his native El Salvador, which he fled in 1980 because of a 
brutal civil war. 
</P>
<P>
 His planned departure in September to study international relations comes 
nearly three years after he took over as executive director of the 13-year-old 
agency based in Pico-Union. El Rescate provides social and legal services to 
many of the 400,000 Salvadorans and other Central Americans in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Andrade's plans came as no surprise -- he had said he would serve for 
only two years when he took over as executive director in 1991 -- the 
resignation has sparked a debate over the direction the organization must take. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are dealing with a transition from serving a refugee community to an 
immigrant community," said the Rev. Don Smith of the Presbyterian Synod of 
California and Hawaii and a member of El Rescate's board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade and the agency's supporters have said public interest in helping 
political and economic refugees who fled El Salvador's bloody 12-year civil war 
dimmed after peace accords were signed in December, 1992. A drop in donations 
and serious financial problems followed for the agency, which resulted in 
layoffs and scaling down programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have to diversify after the crisis last year," said Andrade, 
adding that promised grants fell through. "What happened was (donors) said, 
'The war is over and El Salvador is no longer a priority.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although the agency's budget went up from $900,000 in 1992 to about $1.2 
million last year, it has since plummeted to $600,000 for 1994. Fund raising is 
among the key issues Andrade's successor must tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that financial stability is going to be a priority. 
We've had the Academy Award parties that have been helpful in the past and some 
people have suggested that we've underutilized the people associated with 
that," Smith said, referring to annual parties that the agency throws during 
the Oscars. This spring's party raised nearly $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade said the agency should also look toward raising money within the 
Central American community, citing a direct-mail campaign last year that 
garnered about $70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 But equally important in promoting El Rescate's image as a community-based 
group will be its role in providing long-term help to residents. Other 
organizations, such as the Central American Resource Center, have changed their 
names and mission purposes to reflect what they say is a move away from dealing 
with the community as refugees to a permanent presence in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any agency working with the Central American community needs to understand 
where they are coming from and look at the major transition that has occurred," 
said Roberto Lovato, executive director of the Central American Resource 
Center, a social service and legal agency that has worked with El Rescate. 
"That transition includes understanding that we (Salvadorans) are here to 
stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade agreed, adding that the current focus on immigration and initiatives 
barring undocumented immigrants from receiving public services is unlikely to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, the hottest issue is and will continue to be immigration because 
until the economy improves they (immigrants) will continue to be blamed. But 
the other issue will be how do you allocate resources in the community," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The creation of a community credit union, naturalization workshops and 
additional vocational training programs are some of the ways El Rescate plans 
to serve the Central American community, Andrade said. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of a new director to fill the $35,000-a-year job is expected 
to coincide with the release of a new mission statement for the agency next 
month. The plan will outline specific goals for the next three to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrade's successor will need to be a bilingual administrator who can be a 
fund-raiser and activist while adeptly building links to other agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our role here, particularly given the climate we face in California, needs to 
be concerned with a greater degree of challenges that we'll face and an 
emphasis on long-range planning that will help (Central Americans) determine 
their future here in California," Smith said.

RICHARD EDER: WHEN IT WAS FUN TO BE RED; UN-AMERICAN ACTIVITIES: A MEMOIR OF 
THE FIFTIES, BY SALLY BELFRAGE (HARPERCOLLINS: $22.50; 264 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD EDER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sally Belfrage was born in Hollywood in 1936. Myrna Loy was her godmother; and 
she attended a birthday party for Shirley Temple where the cake, for age-image 
reasons, was one or two candles short. Her English father and mother were stars 
in the Beaverbrook newspaper galaxy: Cedric Belfrage, a film and theater critic 
whom Noel Coward once denounced as a cad for attending an opening in a soft 
collar, and Molly Castle, a chatty columnist billed as "The Girl Everyone 
Reads." They were a golden couple; a visit to the Soviet Union led them to join 
the Communist Party briefly and then to go on, with fewer constraints, as 
fellow travelers. It was a time when, in Hollywood at least, it was fun to be 
Red; much better than boring, or out of touch or -- of course -- dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The war came, and for Cedric it went on being fun; much less so for Molly and 
their two children. They moved to New York, where he worked for British 
Intelligence and later traveled to Occupied Germany to pick anti-fascist 
editors for the denazified newspapers in the British sector. Anti-fascist, in 
those first postwar months, tended to mean communist or socialist. For Cedric, 
a blithe spirit oddly harnessed to an unchanging political loyalty, that was 
all to the good. 
</P>
<P>
 For the changing political climate in the United States, it was all to the 
bad. His Hollywood politics, his role in Germany and above all his founding of 
the intransigently leftist National Guardian -- it backed the candidacy of 
Henry Wallace; mostly supported the Soviet Union, though not its feud with 
Tito, and was anti-anti-Communist all through the Cold War -- earned him the 
steady attention of the FBI. Soon it would earn him the wrath of the House 
Un-American Activities Comittee and, in the mid-'50s, arrest and deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Sally Belfrage's partly comic, highly painful and ultimately 
unreconciled memoir portrays him by and large as a happy warrior. The victim of 
his war, though, was not the object of its attack -- the Cold War did just fine 
and so did domestic anti-communism. It was the bystanders: his family. "The 
phone was tapped from the moment I could talk on it," Sally writes. Nick, her 
younger brother, was stood up in his classroom at age 12 by a teacher who 
demanded: "Who you going to kill today, Belfrage?" Molly, whose interest in 
politics had long since expired, was fired from her job at McCall's, called up 
before the HUAC and, refusing to denounce Cedric, was deported even before he 
was. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the best thing that he had done for her since the golden Hollywood 
days. Sally's memoir is about something deeper and more destructive than the 
troubles of a family singled out by McCarthyist oppression. The awfulness was 
internal. From the time they moved to New York, Cedric rarely came home. He 
fathered a child by a Frenchwoman, set up housekeeping with another woman and 
eventually divorced Molly. The children were left with a mother who went about 
for years in a state of weeping, self-absorbed depression. From a glamorous 
life and an admired profession, she found herself in a cramped New York 
apartment, coping with short funds and a deep loathing of domesticity, and cut 
off from her country, her work, her outings and her friends. Deportation to 
England paradoxically restored her to many of these things, to something like 
the life she had been exiled from. 
</P>
<P>
 Sally Belfrage, who died a few months ago, grapples with the lost glamour, the 
misery, the traces of sophisticated blitheness that flickered in the misery and 
two other things. One is the grievous pain of a child who would have been quite 
willing to share the struggle of a father she worshiped but whom, for most 
purposes, he abandoned. The other is her confused adolescent identity, torn 
between the painful eccentricity of her family's public and private life and a 
need to become a normal American teen-ager: curlers, pleated skirts, etiquette 
(entering a room, make sure you sit in a chair that matches your dress), sexual 
etiquette (third-date kiss and cautious gradations well this side of going all 
the way) and the ultimate triumph of getting pinned to a West Point cadet. 
"When I was a child I wanted to be famous; by adolescence I yearned to be 
invisible," she writes. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a lot to put together, and Belfrage's memoir is something of a hybrid; 
often ragged, and in some ways emotionally and intellectually quite unresolved. 
It runs until she is 18 and is off to visit her newly deported mother; it picks 
up in an epilogue when she is in her 50s, and her mother and her father are 
dying in their comfortable homes in Bermuda and Mexico, respectively. There are 
only sketchy references to the years between: her private life and her career 
as a writer and journalist largely engaged on the left. Many of the 
contradictions of her adolescence reappear in the epilogue's last year; in one 
instance, astonishingly. 
</P>
<P>
 The raggedness and the contradictions make for uneven writing. "One thing I 
get from my father is that I am an Unamerican," she writes, "though what a 
terrible long time it took me to be glad of it." This is an unstable rock on 
which to build a memoir; especially since so much of the book details her 
efforts to fit in with her high school friends and the 1950's notion of the 
good life. It disengages her from her adolescent self -- often crudely and in 
an almost cartoon-like fashion -- without managing quite to attach to anything 
else, except in the form of a highly abstract sketch of her later radicalism. 
Certainly, although she has taken on a part of her father's political heritage, 
her portrait of him, though sometimes engaging, is essentially distasteful. 
</P>
<P>
 All this is uneasy going, and yet it gives "Un-American Activities" something 
different and sometimes more striking than emotional honesty: the search for 
it. Often she misses; but when she succeeds, she can write with a fine and 
startling emotional clarity. She starts off, for example, in something of the 
Mitford tone of privileged disaster, where horrors are presented comically with 
an air of aristocratic insouciance. Suddenly she pivots and writes of her 
childhood, when her parents were coming apart without talking about it: "A 
profound despair covered up by a fraudulent happy-go-luckiness whose 
manufacture was the last, worst torture." 
</P>
<P>
 The story of her high school affair with a West Point cadet -- it was not 
meant to be an affair but in the course of a heavy session, she writes "it just 
leaked in" -- is astonishing. He was straightforward, ambitious, tender, moral 
and devoid of moral imagination. She goes through a terrible abortion alone and 
breaks with him; 30 years later he turns up, a major general whose specialty is 
missile warfare. Instantly, despite their totally divergent views and his 
marriage, they launch a prolonged, passionate affair under the eyes of Army 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 This is comet-like; it fits in with nothing else, except with the unresting, 
unappeased vision that Belfrage has of herself, her life and above all, of her 
father. Cedric's gaiety, charm, affection and public passions imprinted her; 
his intimate aloofness and material abandonment made the imprint a palimpsest 
-- of which this memoir is an uneasy image.

A WIZARD IN THE WHITE HOUSE; 'THE AGENDA' UNWITTINGLY SHOWS HOW A FOCUS ON 
ACCESS IMPOVERISHES JOURNALISM; THE AGENDA: INSIDE THE CLINTON WHITE HOUSE, BY 
BOB WOODWARD (SIMON & SCHUSTER: $24; 334 PP.)  
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By David Lauter, David Lauter covers the White House for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For nearly two decades, Bob Woodward has methodically burrowed into major 
institutions of American government seeking to describe how decision makers 
make decisions. Every few years, in what has become one of the capital's 
best-scripted rituals, a new Woodward project is launched into the world. 
First, he tackled/went after/did/ the Supreme Court ("The Brethren"), then -- 
(after a detour to write about the comedian John Belushi) -- the CIA ("Veil"), 
next the Pentagon ("The Commanders") and now, with "The Agenda," the 
presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 While each of Woodward's books differs, what all have in common is the 
author's stock in trade: access. Each promises readers the "inside story," the 
"behind the scenes" view that will explain not what appears to be happening but 
what is really going on. 
</P>
<P>
 Access, of course, feeds on itself. By now, Woodward's reputation as an 
indefatigable and irresistible investigator -- he is now an assistant managing 
editor at the Washington Post -- has grown so imposing that few in official 
positions are brave enough to resist his entreaties to talk. After all, the 
high-level official reasons, if everyone else is going to talk to Woodward and 
do his best to make himself look good, how can I afford to hold out? 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, access is to Washington what star quality is to Hollywood. For many 
Administration aides, toiling away their days and nights in obscurity, being 
interviewed by Bob Woodward is a validation and a reward. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials always begin with the belief that they can control how far the 
exchange will go. Some do. From the generally positive accounts "The Agenda" 
offers of Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen, for example, one can assume that 
Bentsen and his friends and aides handled their side of the access bargain 
well. Inevitably, however, some go too far, revealing more than they intend. 
</P>
<P>
 The unstated premise of Woodward's work -- and of access journalism in general 
-- is that, as in "The Wizard of Oz," what the public sees is actually just a 
show manipulated by those who stand behind the curtains. Gain access behind the 
curtains, and one can unmask the real truth. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Agenda" raises some doubts about that premise. To begin with, the book, 
while lively and often interesting, contains no real revelations. Were "The 
Agenda" a newspaper story, the headline might read "Clinton Economic Program 
More Conservative Than Campaign" or, in a less sober publication, perhaps, 
"President Has Bad Temper, Powerful Wife." A reader does not need Bob 
Woodward's access to deliver those insights. 
</P>
<P>
 What a reader does want Woodward's access for are the details -- the lovingly 
collected anecdotes and bits of color that bring life to the otherwise dull 
matter of government decision-making. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it is precisely the details of Woodward's work that always come 
clouded by his technique. As in his previous books, Woodward indulges his 
penchant for re-creating dialogue -- putting into the mouths of his characters 
words he did not actually hear them speak during meetings he did not attend. In 
his introduction, Woodward describes the technique, explaining that he derives 
the quotations from memos, notes, diaries or the recollections of participants; 
he offers the not-entirely-reassuring statement that he has at least one source 
for each fact he cites. 
</P>
<P>
 Given Woodward's experience and reputation, there is no reason to think he has 
not faithfully reported what his sources told him. But given the frailty of 
human memory and the tendency of people to recall only what they want, even in 
their memos and diaries, there is no reason to think that the sources got it 
all exactly right. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, while one may question the exact words or sequence of events 
Woodward reports, he has clearly caught the flavor, the tone and the substance 
of those hectic first few months of the new Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of his details are telling and vivid. There is Bill Clinton wowing Laura 
Tyson, who would soon become chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, by 
remembering an article she had written in the American Prospect, a 
small-circulation liberal magazine. There is Hillary Rodham Clinton dressing 
down the President's staff for failing to find an adequate way to sell his 
program to the public. There is Bill Clinton, again, shouting an epithet at 
Nebraska Sen. Bob Kerrey when the senator says he plans to vote against the 
Administration's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Those are the highlights of the book, engaging portraits of some of the 
Administration's main actors, beginning with the President himself -- highly 
intelligent, deeply committed to his programs, but plagued by indecision, 
petulant when frustrated and at times baffled by the conflicting demands of his 
job. No doubt Clinton's admirers and detractors will both find evidence here 
for their positions. Those yet to make up their minds about the President, 
however, may find themselves wishing Woodward had made the effort to analyze, 
rather than just present, the anecdotes he has amassed. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, that is the drawback of Woodward's approach: Large doses of access, 
like large amounts of sunlight, can blind as well as illuminate. 
</P>
<P>
 The central narrative of "The Agenda" describes how, during the first seven 
months of the new Administration, Clinton abandoned much of the economically 
populist, "putting people first" economics of his campaign in favor of a 
package that focused on deficit reduction. Woodward's book shows that process 
happening but explains little of why. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodward has two main problems. First is that, in his emphasis on describing 
the process, he says little about the substance. For a book about economic 
policy-making, this one contains precious little economics. A reader could 
easily walk away from "The Agenda" wondering what exactly it was that all these 
people were arguing about. 
</P>
<P>
 The second problem is that large amounts of the detail Woodward amasses are 
not only behind the scenes but also, in the end, beside the point. While 
Woodward's goal may be to show where real power lies, what he displays, in 
fact, is that much of the frantic action of White House aides, Administration 
officials and congressional barons is just so much wasted motion. 
</P>
<P>
 As Woodward notes, and as many news reports pointed out before the election, 
simple arithmetic left no doubt that some major part of Clinton's economic 
program would have to disappear. Political arithmetic left no choice which. 
From the moment of his election, in which he won only 43% of the vote, Clinton 
would face overwhelming pressure to cut spending and scale back his plans for a 
more ambitious federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 Seen in the light of insider access -- the light of Woodward's material -- the 
meetings between Clinton and Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve, 
and between Greenspan and top Clinton advisers, seem to take on great 
significance. Indeed, Woodward's publicists have trumpeted those meetings to a 
degree that the book itself does not. 
</P>
<P>
 In the light of political reality, however, the meetings shrink in importance. 
Clinton followed the path Greenspan advocated, emphasizing deficit reduction, 
not because he somehow had fallen under the Fed chairman's spell but because he 
had no choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodward knows this. Periodically he will note, often quoting one or another 
of his cast of characters, how precious little maneuvering room Clinton had as 
he put together his economic plan and lobbied for its passage on Capitol Hill. 
Yet, ultimately, the truth is a conclusion he cannot quite articulate -- unlike 
the Wizard of Oz, the men and women behind the curtain are not grand 
manipulators, but just another bunch of Munchkins like the rest of us.

 "The drug dealers make a lot of money down here," he said. "There are so many 
people using drugs down here because it's easy to get. This area is really a 
pocket for drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the drug dealers' clients are Rambeau's clients. 
</P>
<P>
 Rambeau, 47, a Paiute Indian, runs United American Indian Involvement Inc., 
which for 20 years has served as the only Skid Row walk-in crisis center for 
Native American drug and alcohol addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 Housed in a three-story building at 118 Winston St., the center started 
primarily as an effort to take Native Americans off Downtown streets and help 
them sober up. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other drug and alcohol rehabilitation programs, all counselors at 
Indian Involvement are Native Americans and emphasize psychological and Indian 
spirituality methods to build substance abuse addicts' self-esteem and cultural 
identity. 
</P>
<P>
 "That sets up a more comfortable relationship," Rambeau said. "The person they 
see trying to help them is like them." 
</P>
<P>
 The center also offers family and youth programs, such as camp trips and 
visits to Indian reservations and arts and crafts activities for adults and 
teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rambeau estimates that 3,000 Native Americans -- out of 60,000 to 80,000 in 
Los Angeles County -- are spread throughout the Central City, Hollywood and 
East Los Angeles areas, though they remain relatively hidden among other ethnic 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say probably 80% of the people we serve are homeless . . . and have 
an alcohol or drug problem," Rambeau said. "Probably another 15% are either 
living below or right about the poverty level and another 5% could be anywhere 
above that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Those numbers are small compared to the Latino and African American 
populations that suffer from similar problems and economic conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 Rambeau said he believes that government officials usually dish out more money 
to those ethnic groups and in turn have shortchanged funding for Native 
American programs such as United American Indian Involvement, which celebrated 
its 20th anniversary Saturday.  
</P>
<P>
 "When you're the minority among the minorities, you're not going to get the 
services (for funding)," Rambeau said. "It's always been like that." 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which five years ago cut back on meal services from twice a day to 
only once a day, has survived on an average budget of just under $300,000 a 
year in federal, state and county funds. 
</P>
<P>
 That amount, however, has only doubled from the $123,000 federal seed money 
United American Indian Involvement received to open in 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's (ever) been enough continued funding," said founder 
Baba Cooper, a mixed Dakota Black Feet and Oneida Indian who served as director 
for eight years. "They need a new building . . . one that can accommodate the 
needs down there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper now produces 30- and 60-second public service announcements about 
Native Americans in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a very small minority base, but we have a very huge (alcohol and 
drug) problem," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, then 23 years old and a recovering drug and alcohol addict, first saw 
the need to set up a program on Skid Row and give Native Americans a second 
chance at productive lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Back then, drug dealers were not as much of a presence as were the liquor 
stores near the Indian Involvement building, she recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody wanted to go down into that community," Cooper said. "It was 
considered untouchable, and nobody wanted to help the Indian people out there 
unless they got sober, and there was no means for them to get sober." 
</P>
<P>
 Most Native Americans were unwilling to go to other non-Indian rehabilitation 
programs or homeless services, such as the Union Rescue Mission, because they 
didn't feel comfortable "saying prayers, becoming a part of a religion they 
weren't any part of," Cooper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indian Involvement center offers 16 beds, men's and women's showers, a TV 
and laundry room, and has six staff members and a part-time cook, Rambeau said. 
It also provides clothing, transportation, and emergency housing and counseling 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, the center provided shelter for 104 people and served 12,727 meals. 
</P>
<P>
 One key change that the center has made concerns sobriety. Three years ago, 
Rambeau began requiring people to be drug- or alcohol-free for 30 days before 
they can receive help or come for noontime meals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were providing a situation that would enable them to use drugs and drink," 
he said. "They have to start taking responsibility for themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Although no figures are available as to exactly how many clients have sobered 
up through the center's assistance, some have moved on and found stable jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gave me a second chance in life," said Andy Jones, 49, of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a Tohono-O'Odham-Cherokee, came to the Indian Involvement center in 
1982 and became sober after attending Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. He now 
works as a clerk at Transamerica Occidental Life Insurance Co. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I never forgot them," he said. "When you're on the streets and you're 
homeless and somebody pays attention to you . . . somebody treats you like a 
human being, that means a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Charlotte Hungary, a 34-year-old Arapaho Shoshone, and her husband both live 
in Skid Row hotels and come to the center to eat lunch and wash their clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We go to our AA meetings and parenting meetings," said Hungary, whose five 
children are in foster care. "It keeps us out of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 Rambeau said that, in addition to encouraging sobriety, the center emphasizes 
building strong relationships between parents and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcohol affects all parts of the family," he said. "It's not just one person 
who has a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we're going to have any kind of a future, we're going to have to have the 
families involved in the future."

DORSEY STUDENTS STUNNED BY KILLING OF 2 CLASSMATES; CRIME: DEATHS CAST A PALL 
DURING FINAL WEEK OF SCHOOL. THE YOUTHS APPARENTLY WERE INNOCENT VICTIMS OF A 
WAR BETWEEN BLACK AND LATINO GANGS IN VENICE.

<P>
 By all accounts, they were outgoing, friendly students. One was set to 
graduate last week and planned to attend college. The other was a junior who 
had yet to commit himself to his studies but was filled with potential. 
</P>
<P>
 But the two Dorsey High School students' lives ended in a hail of gunfire June 
10, apparently innocent victims caught in a bloody street war between black and 
Latino gangs in Venice. Their slayings have shocked students and teachers at 
the Crenshaw district school and caused them to question why two young lives so 
full of promise could end so tragically. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Tizcareno, 17, and 18-year-old Jose Alvarez, both of the Mid-Wilshire 
area, died at the scene, police said. Two other Dorsey students -- Rafael 
Campoy, 17, and Javier Lopez, 18 -- suffered minor gunshot wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were just in the wrong place at the wrong time," Los Angeles Police 
Detective Wayne Blandon said of the youths, who were in Venice to buy a pager 
during a school break when several gunmen opened fire. "They were caught like 
fish out of water." 
</P>
<P>
 Tizcareno's mother, Maria Perez, said he had gone to Venice to buy the pager 
before going to work. Perez, an unemployed single mother with three other 
children, said her son would sometimes use his savings to help the family make 
ends meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was my right hand, my hope," Perez said. "He was everything to me. . . . 
He told me, 'When I get older, you'll be proud of me. ' " 
</P>
<P>
 As of last week, no arrests had been made in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the shootings were widely reported over the weekend, not all Dorsey 
High students were aware as they returned to school Monday of the deaths of 
Tizcareno and Alvarez. Early that day, the news was announced over the school's 
public address system, and many students broke out in tears. 
</P>
<P>
 "You just can't believe it. You keep thinking they are still alive," said 
junior Maurice Guifarro, 16, a friend of Alvarez. "It's really sad. They didn't 
have to die." 
</P>
<P>
 Guifarro said his class went silent when the news was broadcast. One girl 
began sobbing and hugged Guifarro for comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people were so upset that they had a hard time taking finals," said a 
17-year-old student who asked not to be identified. "We have a good school, and 
this kind of stuff doesn't happen here." 
</P>
<P>
 Though violence has scarred other Central Los Angeles high schools in recent 
months, Dorsey officials said this was the first shooting incident this year 
involving Dorsey students. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, the school held a memorial service at its library, where 
students read poetry they had written about their slain and wounded friends. 
That service was closed to all but Dorsey students and employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Tizcareno had bought his graduation cap and gown and was set to attend 
commencement services last Thursday. He planned to work full time during the 
day and enroll in night classes at Los Angeles City College. "This was a kid 
who was on his way. . . . He was very reliable, dependable and set to make a 
contribution to society," said Assistant Principal Beverly Clarkson. 
</P>
<P>
 Several days before he died, Tizcareno had graduated from a learning academy 
sponsored by Shell Oil Co. The program places students in jobs and provides 
personal-skills training to prepare them for careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tizcareno, who was placed at the Continental Cablevision offices in Crenshaw, 
did such a good job that the studio offered him a permanent job. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was one of our best students," said Shell spokesman Robert Russ. 
</P>
<P>
 He said Shell is paying the $3,500 cost of Tizcareno's funeral, which the 
family was unable to afford. Family members were unavailable for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarkson said Alvarez was not as studious as Tizcareno but had a lot of 
potential. "He was personable and well-liked. He just hadn't made the 
commitment (to school)," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to get along with people pretty good," said Guifarro, who played 
touch football with Alvarez. Alvarez's family declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Students and officials say the killings have cast a pall over what would 
normally have been a joyous time -- graduation and summer vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't out there gangbanging. These were all innocent victims," 
Clarkson said. "It's just a real tragic loss to society." 
</P>
<P>
 Tizcareno, Alvarez and their two companions were in Tizcareno's red Hyundai 
when a van pulled up and several black males opened fire with a handgun and a 
shotgun, said Blandon of the Police Department. Police said the slayings were 
part of a Venice gang war that has claimed at least 17 lives since last fall, 
including at least half a dozen victims apparently targeted because of their 
ethnic background.

ART; IT AIN'T NEEDLEPOINT; ANN HAMILTON DOES OLD-FASHIONED WOMEN'S WORK -- 
IRONING, WEAVING AND KNITTING. BUT, IF YOU'RE EXPECTING HOME EC 101 FROM HER 
INSTALLATIONS, YOU'D BETTER GET OUT OF THE GALLERY

<P>
 You walk into a vast room that smells of freshly cut plywood walls -- gray 
early morning light pours through the skylight in the arched ceiling. It is 
reminiscent of a barn, and, in the center, a woman is seated with her head 
slightly bowed, expression concentrated, hands busily winding strands onto a 
ball. Light from a hidden projector throws a flickering shadow of the hushed 
figure and her quiet work onto the wall. The sense of deja vu is palpable but 
vague. You rifle through your visual memory and there it is: Vermeer, the 
17th-Century Dutch artist who painted extraordinary portraits of women engaged 
in the ordinary -- writing a letter, making lace or putting on a necklace of 
pearls. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, this is the Ruth Bloom Gallery in Santa Monica, a venue for contemporary 
art, and the artist in situ is Ann Hamilton. You look more closely and realize 
that the yarn is spun of strips of typed sentences. She is lifting thin chains 
of words out of an open book and rolling them into balls of paragraphs and 
pages. Whenever the sentences accumulate to the size of a softball, she pushes 
it through a little scrim-covered screen and onto a table. The table is 
legless, as is the chair where the artist sits -- both are suspended in air by 
nearly invisible cables. Gingerly, you approach to more closely observe these 
balls of thoughts in cozy repose. An unwound fragment of a sentence projects an 
unintentional retort -- "I didn't pay no attention to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, 37, is one of the most celebrated artists now working in the art of 
installation on a grand and theatrical scale. She represented the United States 
at Brazil's Sao Paulo Bienal in 1991 and was a recipient last year of a 
so-called "genius grant," a $250,000 John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur 
Foundation Award, to be given over five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Such grants and awards are essential for Hamilton, since her ambitious 
installations rarely produce artifacts for the art market, aside from a few 
edited video pieces, books and photographs from past installations. This is 
only her second show in a commercial gallery in the last decade; her first was 
at the now-defunct Louver Gallery in New York in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The title of the current installation, "lineament," comes from the Wallace 
Stevens poem "The Planet on the Table." Certainly, the balls of sentences could 
be seen as planets of information. Although the piece required 10 assistants, 
40 books and cost thousands of dollars to make, it is Spartan compared to 
Hamilton's dozen works created over the last six years at art institutions in 
Europe, South America and the United States. Hamilton is renowned for the 
overwhelming scale and sheer quantity of her unconventional materials: 
parasitic beetles and turkey carcasses, pigskins, canaries, 16,000 cleaned 
teeth, 35,000 outdated patent books, a floor covered with 750,000 pennies, and 
the list goes on. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, Hamilton's installations address the conditions and history of the 
place where they are made -- ranging from the List Visual Art Center at 
Massachusetts Institute of Technology to the Spoleto Festival in Charleston, 
S.C. Yet meeting Hamilton is to recognize that for all the drama, ambition and 
fame, she "didn't pay no attention to it." She often speaks in the second 
person as though it were all happening to someone else. For instance, asked 
about receiving the MacArthur Award, she says, "First, you go into Protestant 
guilt thinking of the millions of people who deserve it more than you." But 
noting that she was married last November, she adds gratefully, "it gives you 
the time to slow down and concentrate on the human side of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton has a face that isn't common to the bleached, tucked and made-over 
population of Los Angeles. It's as open as the prairie. Her eyes are the color 
of a wind-swept sky, and her salt-and-pepper hair is worn short and tousled. 
She is so unguarded and friendly that she could only be from another part of 
the country, which turns out to be Ohio. She grew up in Columbus and that is 
where she lives today, after a 15-year absence studying and teaching on both 
coasts. 
</P>
<P>
 The fundamental sensibility of her work is drawn from her Midwestern roots and 
that region's white, Protestant culture. "One of the things about being raised 
in that environment is that it has inherent tenets of Calvinism. You bought the 
story that labor is its own redemption," she says. Each of her installations 
requires the unstinting, obsessive labor of the artist along with dozens of 
co-workers, both paid and volunteer. Together they slice sentences out of old 
books, iron and starch shirts, scorch walls with candle soot, pound metal 
tokens onto floors. The sensibility is emphatically pre-industrial, especially 
in terms of the labor -- which is collaborative and repetitive. Like a quilting 
bee, it allows time for the workers -- who are most often women -- to talk and 
be of service to some lost part of themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work part of it, for me, is a way of understanding something in a way 
that isn't thinking it," says Hamilton. "That's why there is a lot of 
repetition. It may seem monotonous but every moment is different in its 
sameness." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton cites her mother, who often helped with the early installations, as 
an influence. "She is of that generation that spent a whole lot of her life 
organizing volunteers, a generation that is disappearing," Hamilton recalls. 
"Also, it seemed like we were wallpapering a lot. I laugh at the way I'm doing 
(those things) but in a different context." 
</P>
<P>
 Collective labor gives way in each installation to a single person involved in 
some repetitive gesture. Hamilton decided on the gesture of balling yarn after 
learning that one of oldest representations of labor is that of a woman 
spinning. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems the gestures (in the installations) often come back to these basic 
processes. In doing it, you know it feels right. Maybe it's a bodily memory." 
</P>
<P>
 For women, maybe. Certainly, for Hamilton. She grew up in a fairy tale home of 
stable and supportive family members. "I learned to sew from the time I was 
really young. We did needlepoint and all those sorts of lap activities," she 
says. "I learned from my mother and my grandmother. But you leave all that 
stuff behind at a certain point." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, Hamilton put it in storage. Her artistic instincts initially brought 
her to the textile design program at the University of Kansas, where she 
received her bachelor's degree in 1979. In the early '80s, after studying 
weaving at the Banff Center in Alberta, Canada, she spent a few years working 
in a sewing factory, editing a journal, going to films and, finally, Yale 
University School of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 "I made a conscious decision when I went back to graduate school not to go to 
a fiber program because I didn't think it was conceptually very interesting. I 
decided to go into the sculpture department because that's just about 
relationships which could be anything," she recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 Yale made an immediate impression: "Everyone is making big steel stuff, so you 
don't really feel like knitting. It's all very unspoken. But I remember my 
interview at Yale when the department head said, 'You don't do this weaving 
stuff anymore, do you?' " She laughs, a big, hearty, gusty release. 
</P>
<P>
 Photographs of Hamilton's graduate school work show the artist as hedgehog -- 
dressed in a suit and carrying a chair on her back all covered in prickly 
toothpicks. In another, a shoe appears to be mashed into her mouth. In their 
deadpan humor, the images recall the early conceptual photography of artists 
like William Wegman, John Baldessari and Vito Acconci. Hamilton acknowledges 
receiving a healthy dose of such information via the visiting artist program at 
Yale. "If you are interested in the fact that all of your experience is up 
here," she says, pointing to her head, "you put a shoe in your mouth and you 
are talking about disjunction. Those things came out of the sort of 
self-scrutiny that is going on all the time." A decade later, her installations 
are enlarged versions of the surreality of such illogical juxtapositions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although encouraged by her teachers to try performance art, Hamilton felt 
uncomfortable with her few efforts in that direction. "One of the things about 
these installations is that when you walk in, you are implicated as a subject. 
You don't have the distance you have in a theater. I was more interested in a 
kind of time that was like a perpetual present." 
</P>
<P>
 After graduating from Yale, Hamilton taught as assistant professor in the art 
department of UC Santa Barbara from 1985 to 1991. During this period, her 
installations grew in scale and complexity, many of them at California art 
institutions. Her "still life" was staged in a Santa Barbara private home in 
1988 as part of a series of installations sponsored by that city's Contemporary 
Arts Forum. The artist sat before an enormous stack of men's white shirts, 
starched and ironed stiff. The air smelled of the eucalyptus leaves she had 
embedded in the walls with wax, in the background opera was playing. That same 
year, she created her enormous installation "the capacity of absorption" at 
L.A.'s Temporary Contemporary. Ten tons of linotype were laid on the floor, the 
walls of one gallery were covered in slimy algae, a man stood with his fingers 
in water running off a long metal table, while an adjacent gallery held a giant 
megaphone made of flax. 
</P>
<P>
 At Capp Street Project in San Francisco, she staged "privation and excesses" 
in 1989. A floor of new pennies was laid amid a coating of honey. Three sheep 
were penned into an adjacent gallery to stare at the scene. A seated figure, 
sometimes the artist, sat wringing her hands over a hatful of honey. Two 
electric mortars and pestles ground a combination of pennies and teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, she installed rows of teeth on an examining table during a survey 
show at the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton has attempted to find ways of knowing and presenting a nonverbal 
world using the senses of smell, touch, sound, sight. She creates unfamiliar 
experiences from the most familiar materials. A knowing Luddite, her 
installations use forms that pre-date the Industrial Revolution. It is this 
stubbornly 19th-Century aspect of her work that has led critics to charge her 
with exploitation of nostalgia. In fact, she is transforming her personal 
history into art. Despite warnings from graduate advisers, Hamilton recalls the 
way in which her interest in those "lap activities" crept back into her work. 
Last year, on a plane to Toronto, she found herself knitting in preparation for 
a piece. Feeling self-conscious, she suddenly said to herself, "Oh, I can do 
this now!" 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a long period of time when those ideas became very taboo," she 
admits. " 'Ooh, that's girls' stuff!' But you can reclaim those in a different 
way. Not that that's the subject of the work, but that is your sensibility and 
the more that you trust that the better off your work is." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet women reissuing domestic labor in their own art is still controversial. "I 
don't know if it's safe," Hamilton admits. "But the more you work, the more you 
trust yourself. You trust impulses you can't always credit, ways of knowing and 
being. You're not censoring those things anymore by thinking, 'Oh, that's corny 
girl stuff.' That's cultural. Even when my projects are getting really big, 
I'll think, 'It's just the spinning and the tale-telling.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The housework of women -- knitting, spinning yarn and reading -- is common to 
the history of 16th- and 17th-century European painting. Critic Dave Hickey 
wrote one of the catalogue essays for Hamilton's installation "tropos," which 
closes today at the Dia Center for the Arts in New York. He says: "She purges 
the industrial world from her art. She has concentrated on the overlap of 
nature and culture and how they infect one another. So you can talk about her 
atmosphere as you would in painting: the translucent light, the sfumato, the 
way the materiality of brush and paint reflect the materiality of the natural 
world, the self-absorbed subject and the way the atmosphere tells us about that 
person's interior landscape. She is making paintings that you can be inside." 
</P>
<P>
 For "tropos," Hamilton covered the gallery floor with horsehair and filmed the 
windows to soften the light. The slurred speech of a man with aphasia fills the 
air while a woman sits reading at a table. As the reader finishes each 
sentence, she chars it with a wood-burning tool. In an earlier installation, a 
woman erased each word of a book by using her own saliva and the pink rubber 
end of a pencil. In "lineament" the books were pre-sliced to be strung out and 
rolled into balls. Hamilton's unmaking of text is quite literally a 
deconstruction. Yet her work is resonant of the unique personal experience that 
contemporary post-structuralist theory questions. As Hickey discovers, Hamilton 
did her chores while her mother read to her, so the labor became synonymous 
with the song of speech. Unraveling the words helps to make the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton says: "I read a lot of books -- a lot of poetry but also Elaine 
Scarry, Lewis Hyde. The reading is not only to gather information but looking 
for the way a thing is said. I don't have a studio. Reading is my main process 
when I'm not on site on a project." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Hamilton's installations offer no narrative, viewers often feel obliged 
to provide their own. "I was on a panel at Headlands (an art center in the Bay 
Area) with a scientist named Wes Jackson," she recalls. "He said, 'The problem 
is that you're not in control of your metaphors.' " She laughs at the kernel of 
truth in this observation. "You are going along with your intentions and 
someone comes in with the most literal reading. And they're not wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what it's like to look at contemporary art. You go to the didactic 
panel that tells you what to think about it because you couldn't possibly 
understand it on your own." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton points out that viewers have a more immediate experience of her work: 
"During these installations, a lot of people want to tell you their stories. It 
means people trusted themselves in a way. If people want to tell you these 
stories, something else is happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly self-conscious, as if caught in the act of having faith in human 
nature, she adds, "I'm a very optimistic person." 
</P>
<P>
 * Hamilton's "lineament" continues through July 17 at Ruth Bloom Gallery, 2036 
Broadway, Santa Monica, (310) 829-7454. A performer will be seated in the 
installation every Friday and Saturday from noon to 6 p.m. The gallery is open 
11 a.m. to 6 p.m., Wednesday to Sunday.

REPAIR OR REVOLT; A JOURNEY THROUGH ECONOMIC TIME: A FIRSTHAND VIEW, BY JOHN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Somehow I feel I'm being conned when I read old men who, looking back over 
history, give a cheerful appraisal. I trust the cynics. And so, up to a point, 
I trust John Kenneth Galbraith, who in this account of what he "saw or learned 
of the central core of economic life" during his 65 years, sets the tone of the 
book with this observation: 
</P>
<P>
 "Ignorance, stupidity, in great affairs of state is not something that is 
commonly cited. A certain political and historical correctness requires us to 
assign some measure of purpose, of rationality, even where, all too obviously, 
it does not exist." Later he writes of "the primal role of stupidity in shaping 
the course of history." 
</P>
<P>
 Ignorance and stupidity are often encountered in "A Journey Through Economic 
Time," and not least among some of Galbraith's fellow economists, particularly 
those who believe in the "classical" boom-bust, government-hands-off, 
competition uber-alles kind of capitalism and who seek to balance the budget by 
ignoring human misery. 
</P>
<P>
 By Galbraith's reckoning, these pious bunglers misinterpreted the cause and 
importance of the 1929 stock market crash; ruined the first blip of economic 
recovery during the Great Depression of the 1930s; assumed the United States 
would sink back into a depression after World War II; and gave all recent 
presidents extremely inhumane advice on how to handle the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest ongoing mistake of that crowd is its faith in the ability 
of the economy always to bounce back -- that after every bust there will be 
another boom. Galbraith argues, to the contrary, that high unemployment and 
economic stagnation can reach an equilibrium and just hang there. Such an 
equilibrium was reached in the 1930s, and it took a war to break it. He 
believes that such an equilibrium could be developing again. 
</P>
<P>
 So just where, as an economist, does Galbraith stand? If I read him correctly 
-- and I sometimes doubt I can read any economist correctly, even this one who 
claims "there is no economic process or problem that cannot be put in plain 
language" -- Galbraith's philosophy is about 80% John Maynard Keynes (from whom 
he borrowed the just-mentioned equilibrium theory), 10% Karl Marx and 10% ad 
hoc. 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith was one of the many bright young guys who swarmed into the New Deal 
bureaucracy. Some, not many, were Communists. He recalls them with something 
better than tolerance, and why not? In his opinion, "no one of any sensitivity 
could look on capitalism in those years (of depression in the 1930s) and think 
it was a success. There was, accordingly, a choice between repair and revolt." 
</P>
<P>
 He was among the influential, and ultimately dominant, clique who chose 
Keynesian repair. The British eccentric had only recently rocked the world's 
economics establishment with his argument that the path to recovery from 
depression was for governments to stop worrying about deficits and spend, 
spend, spend their way out of the pits. 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith writes, with what I imagine is a pleased grin, that to classical 
economists this proposal seemed almost as subversive and certainly as dangerous 
as communism, and yet every President since then has been forced to follow 
Keynes' piping even while some of them chant the ritualistic mantra of the 
balanced budget. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, Marx's communist doctrines have been used mainly as a 
bugaboo to rationalize monstrous military budgets during the Cold War. At the 
same time, Galbraith notes, our chief economic competitors, Japan and Germany, 
were studying Marx's theories seriously and often with good results, 
particularly in the way they made their governments serve as a kind of 
executive committee for their capitalist class. 
</P>
<P>
 Most liberals in this country find such close cooperation between government 
and the captains of industry to be dangerously undemocratic, just as they 
consider it a prime duty of government to use antitrust laws to break up 
anything that looks even suspiciously like a cartel. Not Galbraith. This 
lifelong liberal believes cartels can be useful, even necessary, in global 
competition, and he thinks the antitrust hang-up is typical of the "devoid 
liberal mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, Galbraith is not just another economist. This transplanted Canadian 
Scot is a man of many hats and moods. While he is best known as a practitioner 
and professor of the dismal science of economics, he has also been a journalist 
(Fortune magazine); an official appraiser of the results (very disappointing) 
of strategic bombing; a speech writer (for, among others, presidential 
candidate Adlai Stevenson); a high-level bureaucrat, and an adviser (often as 
dissenter) and trouble-shooter for various Presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 This is his 30th book. He has ranged over such varied topics as art, 
anthropology, social criticism, travel and, of course, money. One just 
naturally roots for an intellectual adventurer of Galbraith's sort, but I don't 
think "A Journey" will add much gloss to his reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 The journey is so swift as to allow us only fleeting, imperfect glimpses of 
history's landscape. The book is full of hefty judgments and generalities that 
make you curse Galbraith's belief that "detail can disguise the hard and 
essential core. It can also discourage as well as distract the reader." 
</P>
<P>
 Nowhere is the lack of details more irritating than in what otherwise are the 
liveliest parts of "A Journey," his discussion of the two world wars. This is 
particularly true of World War I -- the Great War, as he prefers to call it, 
which wiped out a generation of young men and (the good results) "shattered a 
political structure that had been dominant in Europe for centuries." 
</P>
<P>
 In those days, the fate of nations was still largely determined by the landed 
aristocracy. Bloodlines meant everything. It was, he writes, "a nearly perfect 
design for ensuring that both government and the armed forces would be in the 
hands of leaders of minimal competence." 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith despises these dimwitted aristocrats who still believed that wars 
were to be fought for land and who looked upon their soldiers as little more 
than livestock and suitable for slaughter. But without supporting details, his 
insults let them off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 In this way he treats Winston Churchill, for example, with surprising kindness 
-- surprising, that is, because Churchill was a prime example of the blunderers 
who were elevated to power only by right of birth. As First Lord of the 
Admiralty, he was "the architect of the Dardanelles campaign, the most luminous 
catastrophe of the war." That's all Galbraith says, forcing readers to go to 
other books if they want to learn that this dreadful failure cost the Allies 
250,000 casualties and indirectly triggered the Russian Revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 For these lightweight memoirs, Galbraith may feel it is sufficient to call 
Gen. Douglas Haig "mentally immobile." But that insult is hardly enough to 
convey the mentality of this general who (as other, more serious, historians 
will tell you) planned the battle of the Somme with such incredible stupidity 
as to cause 60,000 Allied casualties on the very first day. 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith chides his fellow economists for their priorities: paying painful 
attention to "a minor change in interest rates or the public deficit" while 
ignoring "urban and rural poverty." Well said. But sometimes the reader may 
feel that Galbraith's devotion to one or another of his theories similarly 
blinds him to more important moral complexities. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, because he believes that a fallen enemy should be allowed to rise 
again as swiftly as possible, he thinks the Versailles Treaty ending World War 
I treated Germany much too harshly ("insanity," he calls it) by demanding 
monetary reparations that the crushed nation could not possibly pay. In fact, 
as he admits, Germany had fully recovered from its depression by 1936 -- long 
before we recovered from ours. Hitler had achieved full employment and a 
booming economy through the sort of make-work programs and wage-and-price 
controls that Galbraith admires, so he has only good things to say about this 
"clearest case of action by the state to promote economic recovery." 
</P>
<P>
 What Galbraith does not tell his readers is that the "insanely" harsh 
Versailles Treaty was not enforced at all on its most important point: 
prohibiting the rebuilding of Germany's armed forces. At the center of the 
economic boom that Galbraith admires were such industrial giants as I. G. 
Farben, which produced much of the material Hitler needed to assault the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith boasts of having written the speech given by Secretary of State 
James F. Byrnes in Stuttgart in 1946, just a little more than a year after the 
end of World War II, returning management of their economic life to the 
Germans. He does not mention that within five years Nazi industrialists like 
Alfred Krupp, who had starved and worked thousands of slave laborers to death, 
were out of prison and back in business in a big way. 
</P>
<P>
 He is proud of his part in trying to protect Germany and Japan from a new 
reparations program -- this time they were to repay the victors with such 
things as coal and industrial machinery, not money. He feared this would have 
"demoralizing" effects. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrings his hands in pity for Germans who watched Soviet soldiers dismantle 
and carry away factories "they depended on for their livelihood." He expresses 
no sympathy for the dismantlers, who were from the nation that had suffered the 
most from the war -- an estimated 20 million dead. He does not mention that in 
those areas of the Soviet Union occupied by the Germans, two-thirds of the 
homes and factories had been destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 What else is here? Well, Galbraith sees hope in the peacemaking qualities of 
multinational corporations but he says nothing about their eagerness to do 
business with human-rights violators, like China. He takes a dim view of using 
economic sanctions to make nations behave. He is not impressed by the 
self-serving motivations and clumsy methods of the major nations in freeing 
their colonies since World War II. He belittles the various foreign aid 
programs. He seems to have little faith that the "comfortably endowed" will 
ever cough up enough in taxes to properly house and train the poor. He favors 
U.N. intervention all over the place because "no country has the right to 
destroy its own people." 
</P>
<P>
 As I neared the end of this book -- approached the mountaintop, you might say 
-- I kept hoping that this aged economics guru would give us some special 
insight, perhaps a summation of his philosophy, something at least as good as 
Kinky Friedman's motto: "When the horse dies, get off." But what we get at the 
end is closer to writer Edward Abbey's remark: "What is the truth? I don't 
know, and I'm sorry I brought it up." 
</P>
<P>
 Galbraith's valedictory is to warn us that the social and political conflicts 
of the future will be between 1) the haves and the have-nots, and 2) the strong 
nationalists and those who want to work for a community of nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, yes, we read the dailies, so that prediction hardly breaks new ground. 
What we want to know, Master G, is how to cope with those problems. 
</P>
<P>
 His reply as the clouds close in around him: "No one can say how these matters 
will be resolved. . . . For the present, one must be content with identifying 
the two conflicts that will shape our lives in all the years to come." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks a lot.

HOW WE TOOK GUADALAJARA'S CROWN; 'MARIACHI USA' HAS SOLD OUT THE HOLLYWOOD BOWL 
FOR FOUR YEARS AND HELPED PUSH L.A. TO THE TOP OF THE MARIACHI WORLD. BUT THIS 
WASN'T THE WAY IT STARTED WHEN RODRI RODRIGUEZ CAME UP WITH THE IDEA. AT THAT 
POINT, IT WAS A VERY TOUGH SELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ENRIQUE LOPETEGUI, Enrique Lopetegui writes about pop music for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When promoter Rodri Rodriguez first approached the Hollywood Bowl in early 
1990 to stage an unprecedented all-day mariachi festival, she was met with 
skepticism. What was a Cuban woman doing with mariachis? And how could she 
single-handedly achieve what Mexicans themselves hadn't? 
</P>
<P>
 All she wanted to do was stage a huge showcase of mariachi orchestras, back 
them with heavy publicity and charge an accessible price to a public that can 
see them for free in Mexican restaurants throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of that, she wanted the prestigious Hollywood Bowl, not just any venue, 
and intended to start a mariachi revival that, in her mind, was destined to 
become an L.A. tradition comparable to New Orleans' Mardi Gras. Not even in 
Guadalajara, the birthplace of mariachi, had anybody thought of such a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bowl's board, said Rodriguez, didn't consider it great business and 
declined a partnership in the venture, even though it is staged there.  
</P>
<P>
 But "Mariachi USA" became such a hit that now, in its fifth year, it expands 
to two nights with shows on Saturday and next Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The tickets are selling great, and a lot of people are going to attend both 
days," said the cheerful, outgoing Rodriguez, 36. "For them, we have a T-shirt 
that says, 'I did it for two days.' " 
</P>
<P>
 After four sold-out annual festivals at the 18,000-seat Bowl, Rodriguez -- who 
has been producing concerts since 1977 and was a Los Angeles cultural affairs 
commissioner from 1984 to 1990 -- no longer has anything to prove for herself 
as a promoter and producer, or for mariachi as a marketable music. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariachi, perhaps Mexico's most distinctive musical expression, was 
transformed by the festival from a popular but lifeless symbol into a 
commercial force in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of "Mariachi USA" also underscores Los Angeles' new preeminence in 
the field. With more than 50 quality mariachis based in Los Angeles, the city 
has replaced Guadalajara as the world's mariachi capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the previous editions, the '94 festival will feature mariachis from both 
the United States and Mexico and Mexican folkloric dancers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Hernandez, musical director of the festival and leader of the Mariachi 
Sol de Mexico, said that this year he prepared several new numbers, including a 
tribute to the unforgettable Mexican trios of the '40s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a night of mariachi and boleros ," said Hernandez, a major 
mariachi innovator and a key force in the revitalization of the music, which is 
now more highly regarded in the United States than in its country of origin. 
Mariachi music in Mexico is still a source of pride, but it's not presented 
with the ambition and care that it is in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even (Raul) Velasco was surprised," said Rodriguez, referring to the host of 
the Televisa network's weekly variety show "Siempre en Domingo," one of the 
most widely viewed television shows in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Mariachi singer) Aida Cuevas asked him, 'How come in Los Angeles 18,000 
people give me a standing ovation while in Mexico mariachis are never invited 
to a TV show?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mariachi -- said to be derived from ancient Aztec rhythms and Spanish 
instrumentation -- was born in the highlands of the Jalisco state around the 
1870s and spread to rural areas of neighboring states. Originally, mariachis 
wore simple canvas shirts and pants, charro hats and belts, and a typical 
three-man lineup would include a violin, Jalisco harp and guitar. 
</P>
<P>
 It evolved after the turn of the century, and during the '40s trumpets became 
a key part of the mariachi sound. The musicians also adopted the famous charro 
costume inspired by the style commonly worn by the landowners. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Mexican President Porfirio Diaz is credited with first taking 
mariachi to Mexico City at the turn of the century, it was mainly Mariachi 
Vargas de Tecalitlan -- still active and considered the world's finest mariachi 
group -- that was responsible for exporting mariachi to the capital in the 
1930s, where it influenced the music for the next 60 years. The genre didn't 
experience any dramatic changes until the pop music explosion of the late '80s 
took over the Mexican airwaves and an increasing number of mariachis began to 
emigrate to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Except in the cases of legendary popular icons such as singers-composers Jose 
Alfredo Jimenez, Miguel Aceves Mejias and Vicente Fernandez, mariachi was 
traditionally viewed as merely accompaniment. "Mariachi USA" changed that, 
putting the mariachis themselves at center stage. The results have been felt 
not only commercially but also creatively. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mariachis here know that in order to compete they have to study a lot, 
because competition is fierce and now there is room for improvement and 
innovation," Rodriguez said. "Mariachi music is no longer a dead folkloric 
tradition." 
</P>
<P>
 The traditional melodic, lyric and visual impact of the music is now enhanced 
by challenging arrangements and even new tunes by some of the groups, who 
realized that the tradition must be kept alive as opposed to relying on old 
classics forever. 
</P>
<P>
 That innovative spirit has met some opposition from purists who claim pure 
mariachi should not mix with other styles -- one of Hernandez's favorite 
pastimes. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's wrong with occasionally experimenting?" said Hernandez, who last year 
dared to even include a brief segment of "mariachi-rap," as part of his 
Mariachi USA set. "If the harmony and arrangements are properly done and the 
essence is there, I see no problem whatsoever. Besides, if a symphony can play 
traditional ranchera music, why can't we play American pop music?" With more 
and more mariachis arriving in Los Angeles, Rodriguez says, it was only a 
matter of time before the music became a strong force. And she wanted to be 
sure it was done properly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never liked the fact that mariachis weren't treated as any other musician. 
I knew mariachis were good enough to be the main attraction." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The first edition of "Mariachi USA" in 1990 was an ambitious and risky gamble 
that not only faced skepticism on a commercial level but also caused some 
people to wonder whether this Cuban woman's passion for the music was sincere. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know more about Mexico than about my own country," said Rodriguez, who 
settled in a refugee camp in Miami at age 7 and lived with a Mexican family in 
Albuquerque until she reunited with her parents when she was 14. 
</P>
<P>
 "I grew up with mariachi music instead of congas and maracas. Most of my 
friends are Mexican, and I've traveled more through Mexico than throughout my 
own country. The problem is that this Cuban girl came out of nowhere to promote 
something she loves. And, worst of all, she was very successful at it." 
</P>
<P>
 But after the first edition -- inspired by a mini-festival held in San Antonio 
15 years ago -- it wasn't hard for her to hush the criticism. Besides the 
commercial impact, "Mariachi USA" has quickly become a Los Angeles institution 
that has inspired annual festivals in San Jose, San Bernardino and San Diego, 
Las Vegas, Tucson, Phoenix and Albuquerque, N.M. As part of its cultural 
mission, Hernandez's Mariachi Heritage Society, partly funded by Rodriguez's 
Mariachi USA Foundation, presents mariachi classes at the East Los Angeles 
Music and Art School. 
</P>
<P>
 The audiences answered the call of "Mariachi USA," says Rodriguez, not only 
because the festival was carefully produced but also because of political and 
cultural reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mexican Americans are beginning to realize they have the right to proudly 
acknowledge their roots, and mariachi is a key part of Mexican and Mexican 
American culture. They're no longer concerned about fitting in but about being 
themselves."*

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: LEIMERT PARK; PARENT GROUPS PUSH TO REMOVE PRINCIPAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Crenshaw High School magnet booster club and two parent groups have joined 
forces in an attempt to replace Principal Yvonne Noble. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Azikiwe, president of the booster group of 15 parents, students and 
teachers, said at a press conference Wednesday at the Vision Center in Leimert 
Park that the coalition plans to pursue her removal with school district 
authorities. He said Noble has obstructed his group's fund-raising drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yvonne Noble is trying to make Crenshaw a state-run school, with no input 
from anyone," said Azikiwe, whose niece and nephew attend Crenshaw. "This is 
not Guatemala, Haiti or the Soviet Union. This is a school system, where 
schools should be run by the community." 
</P>
<P>
 Noble said Azikiwe's charges are part of a personal vendetta that developed 
when she refused to allow his group to officially use the name of Crenshaw High 
for their fund-raising efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Azikiwe didn't want any school officials controlling the money he raised, 
and that's fine, but that means he can't legally use Crenshaw's name," she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 Two other parent groups, the Committee for Positive Leadership in Education 
and Parents for Power, which say they represent about three dozen parents, also 
called for Noble's removal on the grounds that she has inadequately addressed 
parent concerns about student performance and the school's tardy policy. Noble 
denies those accusations, saying the school's tough tardy policy conforms with 
school district standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems arose between Noble and Azikiwe's group in late 1992 when several 
parents began complaining that Noble was rude and disrespectful toward them. 
Eventually, they said, Noble withdrew her support of the group and refused to 
allow it to operate under the auspices of Crenshaw High. 
</P>
<P>
 Azikiwe said he learned last month that Noble was returning mail addressed to 
the group that arrived at the school. He said at least one potential donor, 
West Angeles Church of God in Christ, suspended its aid when the correspondence 
came back saying that no such group existed at Crenshaw's address. 
</P>
<P>
 Noble dismissed the charges that she is obstructing the group's progress as 
"ridiculous." 
</P>
<P>
 "That takes too much time" she said. "I need all the time I can get to help 
these kids." 
</P>
<P>
 She added that neither Azikiwe nor any other member of his group has attempted 
to sit down and talk with her about the matter. ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMENTARY; STILL NOT THE MIGHTY MET, BUT . . .; OPERA IS MATURING IN SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA'S ONETIME WASTELAND. DESPITE A MEMORABLE SEASON, IT STILL NEEDS 
NURTURING TO BLOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BERNHEIMER, Martin Bernheimer is The Times' music and dance critic. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California used to be an operatic wasteland. Sophisticates enjoyed 
pointing out that plastic La-La Land boasted swimming pools where other cities 
had culture. The world laughed -- with justification, alas -- at our 
pretensions. 
</P>
<P>
 The scoffers aren't quite so noisy anymore. Not, at least, when it comes to 
what Henry Fothergill Chorley called the most irrational of art forms. (Now the 
out-of-town elitists just put us down -- with continuing justification, alas -- 
for ignoring ballet.) 
</P>
<P>
 This season, discerning followers of the lyric muse visited Southern 
California to see David Hockney's sets for "Die Frau ohne Schatten," to 
experience the rarity of Placido Domingo in an authentic zarzuela, to make the 
acquaintance of an unheralded world-class Brunnhilde from London, to witness 
the original "Boris Godunov" in a stark modern-dress staging, and to savor the 
impact of a contemporary music-drama from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 We must be doing a few things right. Opera is now flourishing, after a limited 
fashion, from conservative but feisty San Diego to glamorous Los Angeles, with 
cautious but lavish Costa Mesa and adventurous but poverty-stricken Long Beach 
active in between. 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't perfect, of course. Compared to the mighty Met, which coexists with 
the less-mighty New York City Opera next door at Lincoln Center, the seasons 
here are short. Compared to San Francisco and Chicago, the seasons are 
sporadic. 
</P>
<P>
 But we do have opera seasons. Where there's money, there's hope. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It isn't over, they say, until the calorically challenged woman sings. Never 
mind that Bartlett cites the original politically incorrect bromide about the 
fat lady in connection with church, not opera. And, while you're at it, never 
mind that most sopranos aren't overweight these days or that very few of them 
outside Orange County still wear the breastplates and winged helmets cartooned 
by tradition. Some cliches die hard. 
</P>
<P>
 No fewer than three sopranos -- all slender -- signaled the final operatic 
cadence for 1993-94 in Los Angeles. That happened just a Sunday ago when the 
curtain fell on the last performance of "Der Rosenkavalier" at the Dorothy 
Chandler Pavilion. If the preceding offerings had been as successful as this 
updated version of Richard Strauss' bittersweet comedy, one could claim without 
fear of contradiction that opera is alive and well in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 As the immortal Vito Sportivo would have noted, however, it ain't necessarily 
so. The operatic work here isn't always uplifting. Sometimes, despite the 
energetic hustle of local cheerleaders, it's pretty grim. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Music Center Opera season began shakily in September with an overdressed, 
distractingly overstressed, fussily superficial production of "La Boheme," the 
company's second. We used to think Puccini's sentimental indulgence was 
fool-proof. We were wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Hemmings, the resident impresario, entrusted the staging to a misplaced 
movie director, the conducting to a misplaced tenor (guess who), and the stage 
to an ensemble of misplaced lightweights. 
</P>
<P>
 The decors looked too realistic and too ponderous for their own good. Too 
expensive, too. 
</P>
<P>
 At least they were new. For "Un Ballo in Maschera," which followed, Hemmings 
borrowed tattered sets from Covent Garden in faraway London. The trans-Atlantic 
trip hardly seemed necessary. Compounding the inherent problems, two different 
casts left vocal standards erratic. 
</P>
<P>
 One searched in vain for a unifying dramatic perspective amid isolated 
virtues. And one longed for expressive vitality. This was rote Verdi, routine 
Verdi. 
</P>
<P>
 Matters improved in October with "Die Frau ohne Schatten," the first of two 
Strauss operas in a badly balanced seven-opera season. Hockney's whimsical 
dream-color designs magnetized attention even when they contradicted the 
sobriety of the libretto as well as the profundity of the score. Luckily, with 
Ellen Shade, Gwyneth Jones, Jane Henschel and Franz Grundheber in central 
roles, much of the singing held its own against the scenery. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Behr, resident maestro for all seasons and sometimes dubious reasons, 
confounded the skeptics (this one included) who would have preferred a 
high-powered bona fide specialist in the pit for Strauss' heroic convolutions. 
Sometimes phlegmatic, obviously intelligent and, at the very least, reliable, 
he had been scheduled to return in January for the first major production in 
America of Manuel Penella's "El Gato Montes." For some reason, however, the 
baton passed to Miguel Roa of the Teatro Lirico Nacional in Madrid. 
Authenticity was thus ensured. 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when companies everywhere can afford few financial risks, the 
exhumation of Penella's minor opus, written in 1916, didn't exactly seem 
imperative. Many a more important 20th-Century opera still languishes in 
neglect. No matter. Whatever Placido wants, Placido gets. 
</P>
<P>
 In this instance, the tenorissimo who officially serves Music Center Opera as 
artistic consultant wanted, and got, a grateful personal vehicle. It didn't 
hurt, moreover, that the vehicle might seem attractive to Los Angeles' large 
Latino community, a community usually disenfranchised by our cultural 
Establishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily, "El Gato" purred with reasonably crafty verismo ardor -- the 
hand-me-down variety. And the performance turned out to be both poignant and 
stylish, if hardly earth-shattering. The shattering of earth came, not 
incidentally and all too literally, with the quake that rattled everyone's 
composure during the local run (one performance in Orange County followed by 
six in Los Angeles). 
</P>
<P>
 Behr returned in February, as did Puccini, with a dull and dutiful revival of 
the troubled "Madama Butterfly" introduced here in 1991. Even with Christopher 
Harlan correcting some of the directorial gaffes originally committed by Ian 
Judge, this easy exercise proved that one can get too much of a mediocre thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Next on the agenda, in April, was another lazy though cost-efficient effort, a 
revival of the 1990 production of "Le Nozze di Figaro." This time, a patently 
uneven cast found its best efforts compromised by an insensitive, inexperienced 
and, it turned out, inappropriate conductor. 
</P>
<P>
 Once again, one left the Music Center disturbed by the quality of musical 
leadership. Most of the conductors employed here are competent. But -- and it's 
a big but -- they are seldom much more than that (and the gentleman in charge 
of "Figaro" was less). Again and again one misses the forceful, illuminating, 
elevating impulses that should emanate from the pit. It is a matter of 
managerial priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Jiri Kout manned the podium for "Rosenkavalier." He isn't a symphonic 
superstar. He certainly isn't in a class with Kleiber, Davis, Abbado, Muti, 
Solti, Sawallisch, Dohnanyi, Mackerras, Haitink or Levine (the sort of 
conductor we never see in Los Angeles). He hasn't invariably earned unbridled 
cheers in the past; his "Rosenkavalier" at the Munich Festival in 1988, in 
fact, sounded square, even dowdy. On this happy occasion, however, he turned 
out to be an enlightening force, reminding us that routine need not be a dirty 
word. 
</P>
<P>
 The cast at his disposal -- led by Frederica von Stade, Ashley Putnam and an 
impressive newcomer from Stuttgart bearing the intriguing name of Helmut 
Berger-Tuna -- was strong. The controversial production, borrowed from the 
English National Opera, turned out to be stimulating even when it flirted with 
perversity. 
</P>
<P>
 The perversity related to the now trendy custom of playing the action not in 
the period intended by composer and librettist but in the period of the opera's 
composition. Ergo, this unconventional "Rosenkavalier" took place circa 1910 
rather than 1740. 
</P>
<P>
 The concept belonged in this case to Jonathan Miller, but, as is too often the 
case with Music Center Opera, the director was busy with more important 
projects elsewhere. Here, his duties fell by default to an assistant. 
Fortunately, David Ritch proved himself a masterly assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The ongoing problems with Los Angeles opera do not seem to change. The 
repertory is ridiculously lopsided. The company has mustered only one work by 
Wagner, a "Tristan" back in 1987, and no Russian opera at all. There seems to 
be no consistent policy regarding staging styles, and lend-lease programs have 
become a dangerous habit. Too few productions originate here. 
</P>
<P>
 To say that casting standards fluctuate belabors the painful. A relative 
novice is often sent in to do a star's job. 
</P>
<P>
 The same operas come back, and back, with frequency that contradicts artistic 
logic. Next season, for example, we will get Verdi's "Otello" for the third 
time since 1986, while the same composer's "Aida" remains an unfulfilled 
promise. Strauss' "Elektra," presented as recently as 1991, returns 
prematurely, with Behr taking over the podium. Mozart's "Don Giovanni" returns 
after only a two-year absence. 
</P>
<P>
 We can blame many of the vagaries and inequities on budgetary constraints. 
These are hard times for the performing arts in general, and Los Angeles is 
still reeling from a recession. Opera, which demands an elaborate stage 
apparatus and a huge personnel roster, remains the most costly of all the 
performing arts. Still, money -- or the lack of it -- isn't our only problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the most vexing troubles at the Music Center involve aesthetic 
decisions, not financial limitations. One wonders what will happen when the 
Philharmonic moves into its new home across the street and the Pavilion becomes 
a full-time haven for opera (and, one hopes, for ballet). 
</P>
<P>
 One wonders, and one worries. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It was business mostly as usual in 1993-94 for the San Diego Opera, at 29 the 
oldest active professional company in Southern California. The business wasn't 
all that exciting. San Diego audiences are not particularly receptive to 
novelty. But, with Ian D. Campbell minding the store, the business was always 
solidly professional and sometimes more than that. 
</P>
<P>
 The standards here might be described as high-class regional. The casts 
juxtapose famous names with those of promising newcomers and reliable utility 
artists. The productions, usually second- or third-hand, tend to be unabashedly 
old-fashioned. The local product isn't what used to be decried as instant 
opera, but it often resembles hand-me-down opera. 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego season, now confined to the first four months of the year, 
opened with a cool revival of Tchaikovsky's "Yevgeny Onegin." The romantic opus 
was performed this year in Russian, a language understood neither by the cast 
nor by a public slavishly attentive to supertitles projected atop the 
proscenium arch. English would have made better sense, on various levels. 
</P>
<P>
 The linguistic alienation called to mind the deathless prose of Edith Wharton, 
reporting on a turn-of-the-century "Faust" in New York: 
</P>
<P>
 "The unalterable and unquestioned law of the music world required that the 
German text of French operas sung by Swedish artists should be translated into 
Italian for the clearer understanding of English-speaking audiences." 
</P>
<P>
 The age of innocence lingers on. 
</P>
<P>
 After "Onegin," San Diego mustered a "Rigoletto" far superior to the Los 
Angeles version conducted last year by Placido Domingo and staged by his wife, 
Marta, within the same Washington Opera decors. Other installments in the 
season down south were an endearing production of Bellini's "La Sonnambula" 
with the Australian diva Deborah Riedel in the tortuous title role, and a 
not-so-endearing revival of Offenbach's "Les Contes d'Hoffmann" in an outdated 
edition by its plodding conductor, Richard Bonynge. 
</P>
<P>
 For five lonely nights in March, however, San Diego actually took some 
interesting chances. Aiming at the same neglected audience that Los Angeles 
courted with "El Gato Montes," the border city offered the U.S. premiere of 
Daniel Catan's "La Hija de Rappaccini," a.k.a. "Rappaccini's Daughter." 
</P>
<P>
 First performed in Mexico City in 1991, this liberal adaptation of Hawthorne's 
novel functioned as a reasonably compelling psychological thriller, 
economically constructed in a mildly modern -- that is, gently dissonant -- 
idiom. The performance was appreciative, and the staging even recognized the 
theatrical possibilities of symbolism and stylization. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego audiences, alas, were not enchanted. No doubt, they would have 
preferred another "Carmen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Opera Pacific was busy doing its own essentially provincial thing 
under the leadership of David DiChiera at the luxurious Performing Arts Center 
of Costa Mesa. The season here began with a relatively unconventional staging 
of "Faust" that some observers found fascinating, others just silly. This was 
followed by a shamelessly fatuous, unredeemably creaky "Merry Widow" and a 
rather sloppy "Lucia di Lammermoor." 
</P>
<P>
 Lofty vocal standards were a sometime thing. Under little-league conductors, 
the orchestra concentrated on unobtrusive accompaniment. Theatrical attitudes 
and platitudes, most from the laissez-faire school, recalled nothing so much as 
old New Yorker cartoons, but here the wit and whimsy were unintentional. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when we thought it was safe to forget about Orange County as an important 
operatic venue, Costa Mesa swooped in where Los Angeles feared to tread. In 
March, DiChiera & Co. had their way with Wagner. 
</P>
<P>
 The local production of "Die Walkure" looked old-fashioned by current Bayreuth 
standards, and it could not boast superhuman voices in all the demanding roles. 
Still, the cast seemed potent at best, dedicated at worst, and a young British 
soprano named Jane Eaglen made a monumental debut as Brunn-hilde. The Pacific 
Symphony performed minor miracles for John Mauceri, who ignored the usual 
time-dishonored cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 This wasn't just another musical charade. This was serious, large-scale opera. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile in Long Beach, the operatic story is short and unsettling. Among the 
four Southern California impresarios, Michael Milenski works with the shortest 
season and the smallest budget. He also puts on the most daring, most 
progressive, often most stimulating productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach deals in opera for the thinking person. Glamour be damned. This, 
unfortunately, was not the city's finest operatic year. 
</P>
<P>
 It began last summer with an excursion to the Ford Amphitheatre in Cahuenga 
Pass, where Milenski & Co. put on a "Carmen" that sounded tawdry and looked 
like a mindless modernist caricature. The aesthetic coup de grace was delivered 
by the least seductive heroine ever to place hand on hip. 
</P>
<P>
 Back home at the Convention Center, John Cage's "Europas" reinforced the 
company's reputation for serving the obscure avant-garde. But some habitues 
found it reasonable to ask if this experimental happening really belonged in an 
opera house. 
</P>
<P>
 The company found a less controversial challenge in the 1874 version of "Boris 
Godunov," dry, uncompromisingly intellectual and unusually acerbic as staged by 
a resident enfant terrible , Christopher Alden. 
</P>
<P>
 If all had gone as planned, the mini-season would have ended in a blaze of 
humanistic wit as Patrice Caurier and Moshe Leiser reduced Verdi's "Falstaff" 
to an intimate, irreverent 20th-Century comedy. Unfortunately, the rehearsals 
did not go well. One of the directors found himself oddly at odds with the 
soprano cast as Alice Ford, who happened to be married to the gentleman cast as 
Falstaff. 
</P>
<P>
 After much acrimony, the prima-donna walked, taking the primo-uomo with her. 
Desperate to salvage something without destroying the original schedule, 
Milenski scuttled the staging. Engaging last-minute replacements for the 
missing principals, he settled for a concert performance of the Shakespearean 
masterpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was hardly a disgrace. Still, timid compromises aren't part of the 
lusty Long Beach tradition. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 Maybe next season. . . .

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; 10,000 CELEBRATE AT JUNETEENTH EVENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a true family event that had something for everyone, from wandering 
clowns doing quick-hit face paintings for delighted children to grocery 
giveaways for their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebratory spirit of Juneteenth, which observes the day that blacks in 
Texas got the word that slavery was over, was in full force last weekend at Cal 
State Dominguez Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser -- the largest Juneteenth celebration in the Los Angeles area 
-- generated more than $15,000 for the Crenshaw-based organization Great 
Beginnings for Black Babies. 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival-like celebration was held at the velodrome on the campus. For $2 
admission each, more than 10,000 people were treated to live jazz and blues 
performances, face painting, storytelling, rodeo events and grocery giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors sold an array of goods, including Southern food, gift baskets, 
literature, clothing and African American artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was sponsored by Food 4 Less, which owns Boys, Viva, Food 4 Less and 
Alpha Beta markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Event spokeswoman Penny Owodunni said that the company wanted to stage a 
Juneteenth celebration that gave something back to the South-Central community 
that supports so many of its stores. Rather than stuffed animals, carnival and 
game booths gave away toothpaste, soap powder, cereal and other groceries to 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Owodunni said that although Food 4 Less has sponsored two similar events in 
past years, this was the first to benefit a local organization, and the 
biggest. Celebrities such as Hal Williams of the television show "227," Kene 
Holliday of "Matlock" and stage actor Dick Anthony Williams dropped by to lend 
support for the cause.  
</P>
<P>
 Great Beginnings for Black Babies, located in the Crenshaw Square shopping 
center on Crenshaw Boulevard, is a nonprofit group that raises public awareness 
about prenatal health through media and ad campaigns. It is running a billboard 
campaign primarily in black communities that warns against the dangers of 
drinking alcohol during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a cause we truly believe in," said Food 4 Less spokesman Darius 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson added that the Juneteenth holiday seemed a natural context for the 
benefit: "It gave us a good opportunity to highlight the culture of the 
community, and at the same time get involved in a great cause." ERIN J. AUBRY

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHWEST: CRENSHAW; YOUTHS TEACH YOUTHS ABOUT SEXUAL HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enlightening other teen-agers about sexual health and disease prevention is 
not something Jovan Colbert ever thought he'd be doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think like most people my age thought -- nothing can affect me," 
said the 18-year-old Dorsey High School senior and a recent hire at T.H.E. 
Clinic's teen facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the fact of the matter is, teens are sexually active, and they don't know 
all the risks involved." 
</P>
<P>
 That pragmatic approach to sex education is what drove T.H.E. director Sylvia 
Drew Ivie to open a clinic for, about and run entirely by teen-agers. The 
clinic, which opened last week, operates on Ivie's belief that teen-agers 
communicate best with their peers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Often, teens are too shy to discuss things with the regular nurses," said 
Ivie, whose main clinic specializes in low-cost or free women's health care. 
"When I looked at all the different programs that address teens, I saw that the 
program that worked most was teens doing things themselves. So that's how we 
set it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen center is housed in a spacious back wing of the clinic at 3970 Martin 
Luther King Jr. Blvd. What was once an ad hoc conference area is now a waiting 
area, lounge and four individual counseling rooms where teen advocates talk 
privately with clients about everything from pregnancy scares to proper condom 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 The lounge, called "the living room," is a comfortable-looking space filled 
with overstuffed sofas and a monitor that plays informational videos.  
</P>
<P>
 The 14 part-time advocates, trained by the California Regional Family Planning 
Council, also present health workshops at schools, churches and other community 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the presentations and skits are sometimes "not taken seriously 
enough" by young audiences, advocate Carlton Stubbs says, the message that he 
and his co-workers bring is no laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned a lot about how AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases 
spread, and I was surprised that it's growing fastest among teen-agers," said 
Stubbs, of Ladera Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always think about somebody older getting it and dying. It's important 
that our (black) community knows this information." 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem faced by the clinic was a reluctance by teen-agers, especially 
boys, to admit that they need help. Clinic director Auleria Eakins, 20, said 
the addition of male advocates helped, although girls still far outnumber boys 
as clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys believe that nothing can happen to them -- it's more of a macho 
thing," Eakins said. "They think that going to a clinic makes then look like 
punks, like they don't know everything. But the problem among teen-agers is all 
the same: They lack information." 
</P>
<P>
 Tylar Moore, who became an advocate with the new clinic after months of 
screening teen-agers at T.H.E., said she hopes the facility will encourage 
young people to come in before they are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the teens were coming in because of a problem -- not for 
information," said Moore, a 17-year-old Dorsey student who aspires to be a 
neurosurgeon. "But it's better now that we have our own space. We used to take 
people in whatever room was available." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Ivie: "T.H.E. means 'To Help Everyone.' We're trying to do just that."

ON LOCATION; WE THOUGHT HOLLYWOOD LIKED GUNS; 'DEATH AND THE MAIDEN' WAS A HOT 
TICKET ON BROADWAY. BUT WHEN IT CAME TIME TO MAKE THE MOVIE, THERE WERE NO 
TAKERS IN THE STATES. BUT EUROPEAN INVESTORS CAME THROUGH, AND ROMAN POLANSKI 
IS DIRECTING IT IN PARIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, Scott Kraft is The Times' Paris bureau chief. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ben Kingsley sits uncomfortably in a stiff chair, hands tied behind his back, 
movie blood streaming down his shaved head. Pointed at his head is a gun held 
by Sigourney Weaver, a look of satisfaction on her face. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, someone cinches the rope tighter around Kingsley's wrists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, those hands aren't props," he complains. 
</P>
<P>
 Roman Polanski looks up from behind the chair, where he has been kneeling to 
retie the rope. "Sorry, Ben," the director says, with concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh," says Kingsley, softening in surprise. "Hello, guv'ner." Turning to 
Weaver, Kingsley confides with a wry smile: "Say goodby to my circulation. 
Roman's doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 On the set of "Death and the Maiden," the film version of Ariel Dorfman's 
successful play, Roman Polanski seems to be everywhere. Tying Kingsley's hands. 
Adjusting a light bulb. Helping Weaver with a tape recorder. Demanding "just 
one more" rehearsal. Even firing a starter's pistol, which echoes loudly on the 
Paris sound stage, to energize his actors. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see, we have blood here," Polanski tells the crew at one point, 
explaining his request for another rehearsal before the cameras roll. 
"Everything has to function like a Swiss watch." 
</P>
<P>
 As Weaver observes: "Roman pays great attention to malevolent detail." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's marvelous," Kingsley adds later, smoking a cigarette in his dressing 
room. "I love the way he watches. Imagine a child learning to swim. When the 
child looks up, he wants to see his parents watching. Roman is like that 
parent. He never looks away. And that makes an actor feel he can freely create 
and be spontaneous." 
</P>
<P>
 "Death and the Maiden" has been staged in 47 countries and nearly every major 
American city since it opened in London in 1991. The Broadway production earned 
Glenn Close, who starred with Gene Hackman and Richard Dreyfuss, a Tony Award. 
(Reviews of the West Coast premiere, at the San Diego Repertory Theatre in May 
1993, and of the Mark Taper Forum production five months ago, were decidedly 
cooler than those on the East Coast.) 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, for the big screen, it has two big-name stars in Weaver and Kingsley and 
one of the film world's most gifted directors in Polanski. Fine Line will 
distribute it in the United States, and it is scheduled for release later this 
year. And yet, the play's route to the sound stage at Studios de Boulogne in 
Paris has been anything but easy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's safe to say it was just about impossible to get this movie made," says 
Thom Mount, the film's producer. 
</P>
<P>
 Mount had produced the play on Broadway with Bonnie Timmerman, also a 
co-producer on the movie. But when he searched for financing in the United 
States, first with a cast of Anjelica Huston, Liam Neeson and Stephen Rea and 
later with the current cast, he came up empty-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 The producers eventually found the $10 million needed to make the picture from 
an assortment of European investors, a task made easier by Sigourney Weaver's 
strong appeal overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never been on a movie that was more difficult to raise money for," Mount 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason was the material, which is dark, ambiguous and political. It tells 
the story of a woman, Paulina Escobar, an anti-government activist in an 
unnamed Latin American country, who had been kidnaped and tortured 15 years 
earlier by the military regime. The country's new president has selected 
Paulina's husband, Gerardo, a lawyer, to head a commission investigating 
killings by the previous regime. 
</P>
<P>
 On his way home from consultations with the new president, Gerardo has a flat 
tire and is given a helping hand by a doctor, Roberto Miranda. Paulina becomes 
convinced that the doctor is the man who had tortured her night after night as 
she lay blindfolded those many years before. To her husband's dismay, she 
kidnaps the doctor at gunpoint and puts him on trial in their home. 
</P>
<P>
 The play takes place in one house with three actors, beginning late one night 
and concluding at dawn the next day. The screenplay by Dorfman and Rafael 
Yglesias, who wrote the screenplay for "Fearless" based on his novel, maintains 
much of that claustrophobic feeling, at Polanski's insistence. There are still 
just three actors, no flashbacks, no extra characters and the filming is being 
done in sequence. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For Polanski, the physical limitations of the play and the subtlety of its 
message are part of its challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "For Ariel (Dorfman), the most interesting thing was the problem of 
reconciliation after a dictatorship," said the director, whose many credits 
include "Frantic," "Rosemary's Baby" and the recent "Bitter Moon."  
</P>
<P>
 "But the relativity of truth is something I have always found fascinating," he 
said. "And I've always found torture profoundly revolting, since my earliest 
childhood in occupied Poland. I could never understand how man could do that to 
another man." 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean the film will be too dark for audiences. Quite the 
contrary, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Audiences go for entertainment," he said. "It can be simple adventure, it can 
be human, it can be emotions. People don't go to the cinema to learn anything. 
That has to be the icing on the cake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This film has suspense. It is a courtroom drama, and they always work -- it's 
a genre that everybody loves." 
</P>
<P>
 And Polanski believes this psychological thriller, with the deep nuances that 
made it such a hit on stage, will tap renewed interest in what he calls "adult 
films," such as "Schindler's List," "Philadelphia" and "In the Name of the 
Father." 
</P>
<P>
 "Suddenly, filmmakers are making films about serious things," Polanski says 
during a break in the 12-week shoot, which ended last month. "We're using the 
same means of production, but we are turning out movies that are stronger. It 
just shows that well-made movies about the Jewish ghetto in Poland are much 
more interesting than well-made movies about dinosaurs." 
</P>
<P>
 For the actors, the roles are meaty and intense. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I ask of a role is that it requires a certain degree of intelligent 
stimulation of the imagination," says Kingsley, who plays the alleged torturer, 
Miranda. "This fits it perfectly." 
</P>
<P>
 Weaver says the role of Paulina "is so dense, so rich, so difficult. I'm drawn 
to women who are isolated and then burst out of that isolation. And Paulina 
certainly does that. As an actor, you have a sense of having your mast at full 
sail here. I'm going to be pretty spoiled after this film." 
</P>
<P>
 "To be practical," says Stuart Wilson, the British actor who plays her 
husband, Gerardo, "it's a wonderful three-hander. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Death and the Maiden" is, at its core, a whodunit. Is Dr. Miranda the man who 
Paulina claims he is? But it also contains a dilemma. If Miranda is, in fact, 
the man who tortured Paulina, does she have the moral right to use the same 
tactics against him? 
</P>
<P>
 "Can you deal with your oppressor the same way the oppressor dealt with you?" 
Polanski says, posing one of the central questions of the film. "Does the 
demand for retribution give you license to use their methods? I think not, 
although you can't blame a person for spontaneously reacting." 
</P>
<P>
 Paulina's husband, Gerardo, is torn by that question as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is a guiding light for the audience," said Wilson. "He mirrors the 
ambiguity in the piece." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanski, Dorfman and producer Mount were more than happy to do their film 
without the strings that so often come with money from Hollywood. Mount 
produced Polanski's thriller "Frantic," and the pair well remember losing their 
battle with the studio to keep the original ending. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very disturbing story," says Dorfman, in a telephone interview from 
Rome, where the play opened recently. "There is a tendency in Hollywood to say 
we have to go for infantile or puerile emotions. So there is a fear that people 
will not go to see this. I think that is totally wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Polanski was Dorfman's choice as director. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was looking for someone who could find the exact line between the 
commercial and the artistic. Not many people can do that," says the 
Chilean-born Dorfman, who went into self-imposed exile during the regime of 
dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet and now teaches literature and Latin America 
studies at Duke University in Durham, N.C. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Polanski is a strange mixture. He understands the perversion in the 
world, but he also has this childlike innocence. I love that combination." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Polanski, "Death and the Maiden" closely follows the play, with all the 
interior scenes shot in one beach house built on the sound stage by Academy 
Award-winning production designer Pierre Guffroy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Great filmmaking comes from an aggressive, completely personal vision," Mount 
says. "Roman has that. No one understands menace within a confined space better 
than Roman Polanski. He finds astonishing subtlety in the treachery of the 
ordinary." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the set recently, Polanski wears black jeans, with a hole in one knee, and 
a black leather jacket over a white T-shirt. The three actors and the small 
crew lean on every word he utters, in French or in English. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roman doesn't say much, but what he does tell you is gold," Weaver says. "He 
wants to open Pandora's Box. He doesn't look for anything pat and he really 
gets the juice out." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Wilson: "I've learned to shut up and listen a lot more. Roman makes 
extremely interesting dramatic choices -- things you couldn't have thought of." 
</P>
<P>
 Back on the set, with Kingsley's hands tied to his satisfaction, Polanski 
calls again for "action." After the scene, he pronounces: "Print. Beautiful. 
That's it. Merci." 
</P>
<P>
 But then he pauses. "I'd like to do one more," he says finally, "with the 
whole thing a lot faster." 
</P>
<P>
 Five takes later, the scene is in the can. 
</P>
<P>
 Smiling, Polanski says, "Sometimes it's worth it."*

 The Wilshire Community Police Advisory Board is sponsoring a town hall meeting 
on Wednesday for people who live and work in the area patrolled by the Los 
Angeles Police Department's Wilshire Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which begins at 6:30 p.m. at the Center for Enriched Studies, 
5931 W. 18th St., is scheduled to include guest speakers John Mack, president 
of the Los Angeles Urban League, and Police Chief Willie L. Williams, as well 
as a discussion of the advisory board's plan to create a community database. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wilshire Community Safety Network database would include information on 
crime prevention, resource directories, maps and census data, as well as 
articles on community policing and community bulletin board items, said George 
Richter, a member of the board. No confidential or sensitive police or private 
information would be included. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal of the plan is to link all community groups and individuals who are 
committed to improving public safety and increasing communication within and 
between neighborhoods and between citizens and the police, Richter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory board, founded in November, 1992, has 24 members who represent 
the eight basic coverage areas of the Wilshire Division, which is roughly 
bounded by Normandie Avenue to the east, La Cienega Boulevard to the west, 
Beverly Boulevard to the north and the Santa Monica Freeway to the south, along 
with a small portion of Southwest Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The board's mission is to help the Police Department implement community-based 
policing in the Wilshire Division and bring community concerns to the attention 
of the police. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the board wants to mobilize community volunteers to support the 
efforts of the police and supplement the department's human and technical 
resources.

<P>
 Universal Medical Center and Koryo Health Foundation Community Clinic will 
host a health fair expo this week to provide free health screenings for 
residents of Pico-Union and Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 The health fair is open to everyone in the area, but is especially targeted at 
residents whose primary language is either Spanish or Korean and who have had 
difficulty locating appropriate health care services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're catering to the needs of Koreans and Latinos," said Roseann Hahn, an 
administrator at Universal Medical Center. Staff members who speak Spanish, 
Korean and English will be on hand. 
</P>
<P>
 Services to be offered include tests for diabetes, pulmonary function, hearing 
problems, tuberculosis and pregnancy, along with eye exams, spinal exams, 
immunization for children, physicals and health education programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The expo at Universal Medical Center, 2015 W. Olympic Blvd., runs Monday 
through Friday from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m., and Saturday and June 26 from 9 a.m. to 7 
p.m. Organizers are prepared to provide free screenings for up to 3,000 people 
during the week. 
</P>
<P>
 With the financial support of the major sponsors -- Midway Hospital Medical 
Center and United Health Plan -- the staff will also offer free blood chemistry 
tests to the first 70 people in line on each day of the fair. After the first 
70 people, a fee of $15 will be charged for the tests; all other health 
screenings are free. 
</P>

<P>
 A fire at the historic Wilshire United Methodist Church on June 6 caused about 
$120,000 in damage to the church's second floor but has not prevented worship 
services and other ceremonies. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend after the fire, a wedding and regular worship services were 
conducted as planned, said Robert Klein, the church's administrator. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 firefighters contained the fire in a hallway and a room in which 
equipment to run the church's chimes was located, Klein said. The sanctuary was 
not affected by the fire, which originated in electrical wiring. 
</P>
<P>
 The church, designated by the city as a historic-cultural landmark, was built 
in 1927 at Wilshire and Plymouth boulevards. Some members of the church have 
been attending services there since it opened its doors, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Until the fire, the church's chimes rang three times a day. "It will be quiet 
for a couple of months now," Klein said. JAKE DOHERTY

COVER STORY; THE ARTHUR MILLER METHOD; THE PLAYWRIGHT'S FIRST BROADWAY SUCCESS 
WAS ALMOST 50 YEARS AGO. BUT AMERICA'S GREATEST LIVING PLAYWRIGHT KEEPS WRITING 
REAL PLAYS. HE ALSO WORRIES. WHAT'S HE WORRIED ABOUT? READ ON. . . .

<TEXT>
<P>
 Arthur Miller stands in the doorway of the Southbury bus depot, waiting for 
the 10:45 to arrive -- late, as usual -- and keeping an eye peeled for the 
interviewer he has volunteered to fetch. 
</P>
<P>
 The visor on his cap masks his face, but at more than six feet, he's still 
hard to miss. Craggily handsome at 78, the man who is arguably America's most 
famous living playwright may look a bit imperious, but his manner is anything 
but. 
</P>
<P>
 Driving through the verdant hills and two-barn towns of rural Connecticut, he 
plays the tour guide. In a gravelly voice summoned from the vast deep of a 
Brooklyn youth, Miller explains everything from local flora to the region's 
desiccated defense industry. More avuncular than pedantic, he's got the deadpan 
of a master kibitzer down cold. 
</P>
<P>
 He likes to ask questions too, listening intently when talk turns to the 
California economy. Miller has, after all, long been interested in how the 
average Joe gets by. As Lillian Hellman could not and would "not cut (her) 
conscience to fit this year's fashions," Arthur Miller has not abandoned the 
dramatic realism and socially and ethically charged concerns that he first 
brought to Broadway 50 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But it hasn't been an easy five decades. "Broken Glass," Miller's first 
Broadway outing in 14 years, received mostly positive reviews and a Tony 
nomination for best play. Still, the production, which just opened in April, 
will close next Sunday. Serious plays, it seems, hardly ever last on Broadway 
these days. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Kushner's "Perestroika," which won this year's best play Tony, is the 
only new drama on Broadway that's been able to survive this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The year began with the almost-instant closing of "Wonderful Tennessee," a 
work by Ireland's distinguished dramatist Brian Friel. Similarly, both Robert 
Schenkkan's "The Kentucky Cycle" and Anna Deavere Smith's "Twilight: Los 
Angeles, 1992" -- both of also nominated for the best play Tony -- lasted for 
fewer performances than "Broken Glass." 
</P>
<P>
 However, "Broken Glass" has a new life ahead. It went into rehearsal Monday at 
London's National Theatre, and a Paris production is also in the offing. 
Indeed, Miller's work is as popular as ever, with shows running in at least 
five countries besides the United States this year alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Attention is also being paid on other fronts. Kenneth Branagh is scheduled to 
direct and star in Miller's own screenplay of "The Crucible," and 
Pulitzer-winning composer William Bolcom is making an opera of "A View From the 
Bridge." 
</P>
<P>
 Abroad, he is considered America's greatest living playwright. Arthur Miller 
is, beyond dispute, the most senior of the country's actively working serious 
dramatists. Yet not since "Death of a Salesman" has he received the recognition 
in America that he inspires abroad. After years of mostly Off Broadway 
productions and unenthusiastic response here, "Broken Glass" marked a comeback 
of sorts, albeit a bitter one given the short run. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Miller didn't set out with a topical agenda, "Broken Glass" is 
timely. Set in 1938 Brooklyn, it raises contemporary issues of ethnic 
separatism and anti-Semitism. "I've probably been influenced in selecting the 
theme by the recrudescence of anti-Semitism in this world, which is something 
that I wouldn't have believed," Miller says. "It always comes as a surprise, 
whenever it happens. It's 'Well, that's over with; it's not going to happen 
anymore,' and suddenly, there it is again." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has spent a career dissecting public and private morality. In fact, he 
has more than once been called an American Ibsen, including, most recently, by 
the New York Times' David Richards. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the stuff of which boffo box office is made these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a comment on the theater," said Robert Whitehead, a co-producer of 
"Broken Glass" and a 40-year veteran of Broadway, speaking on the day it was 
announced that the play would close. "A play of this depth has a tough time 
right now. It has to do with the kind of taste that has been generated by an 
endless mass of television: It's Las Vegas time. But Arthur Miller's position 
is there forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to comment on the announced closing, Miller expressed a grim view of 
Broadway: " 'Broken Glass' must close after some 10 weeks in New York because 
the costs of running are greater than the receipts. This despite many sellouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "End of 'Broken Glass'? Not at all. It is in rehearsal at the Royal National 
Theatre, London. It will be done in the fall in Paris at the Theatre Marigny, 
and in Munich and other German cities next winter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some plays fail because they are failures. This play, as a play, is precisely 
what I wanted it to be and is beautifully performed. Its audiences, I dare say, 
have been spellbound. 
</P>
<P>
 "The conditions of non-musical theater production in New York are what have 
failed, not 'Broken Glass.' In a city of so many millions, mine was the only 
straight play to have been initiated on Broadway. We used to have a crisis; we 
are now post-crisis, in catastrophe. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the Tony Awards ceremony, a sad self-congratulatory farce, it was proudly 
announced that Broadway shows took in more money than ever last year. This is 
theater as a form of banking. No doubt if they continue raising ticket prices, 
they will take in even more money next year -- but it's not even true; they 
didn't mention that the total take included shows on the road, not just 
Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 "If people want symphony orchestras, ballet, opera, they have to subsidize 
productions. We will not subsidize serious theater. We insist on 
theater-for-profit. And that is the theater we have. There's only one problem: 
Where is it?" 
</P>
<P>
 Whitehead agrees that more than art, the story of Broadway success is of pure 
economics. "There is a confluence of reasons that make it difficult for any 
serious piece of work," he said. "If we could live with the price of a ticket 
that was between $25 and $30, you could go on forever. It's just that you can't 
run a show on that basis with the overhead the way it is, particularly as you 
look into July, when business is always rotten." 
</P>
<P>
 But that doesn't mean Miller isn't held in high esteem, especially by those in 
the theater. Indeed, he's a writer who inspires lofty comparisons. "It makes me 
nervous when people question the relevance of great writers, whether they're 
living, like Arthur Miller, or dead, like Shakespeare," says Old Globe artistic 
director Jack O'Brien, who directed Miller's "All My Sons" and his adaptation 
of Ibsen's "An Enemy of the People" for PBS' "American Playhouse." 
</P>
<P>
 O'Brien says that both Shakespeare and Miller "are extremely moral men who 
value language and who display their sense of humor in unexpected ways. 
(Miller) speaks to something basic and true in us, and we respond." 
</P>
<P>
 But familiarity may breed, if not contempt, then comparative neglect. "It's so 
easy for the well- and ill-intended to dismiss Arthur because he has lasted so 
long," continues O'Brien, who directed this year's Tony-nominated revival of 
"Damn Yankees." "We think, 'Oh, we can't possibly be dealing with those 
questions again.' But, yes, we are." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As Miller steers his oldish gray sedan up the driveway of his homestead, 
Sebastian, a neighbor dog who likes to hang out there, is lying in the middle 
of the garage floor. Miller stops, waiting patiently for the pooch to clear 
out, and then pulls in. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the garage door, beyond the spacious green lawn, are two small studios 
where Miller and his wife of 32 years, photographer Inge Morath, work. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Miller wears khakis and tennies with a light blue cotton shirt. He sits 
on lived-in patio furniture near the house he's called home since 1956 and 
talks about how topical his latest play has turned out to be. "I didn't realize 
that the Holocaust was going to be such the issue, with 'Schindler's List' and 
the museum in Washington and so forth," he says. "That wasn't really the center 
of my concentration. It was, rather, the mystery of how this social-political 
dilemma lodged in this woman's limbs, so to speak, reaching across 3,000 miles 
of water." 
</P>
<P>
 "Broken Glass," which features Amy Irving, Ron Rifkin and David Dukes and is 
directed by John Tillinger, is about a Jewish woman who, upon reading of the 
rising anti-Semitic violence in Europe, develops a hysterical paralysis in her 
legs. Neither her uptight husband (Rifkin) nor a charming neighborhood doctor 
(Dukes) are able to bring her out of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's title suggests the shards of a domestic spat -- the kind that the 
husband and wife, who have been sexually estranged for years, may have had. But 
it also refers to Germany's Kristallnacht, the 1938 night of rioting in which 
the Nazis went on a rampage, shattering the windows of and setting fire to 
Jewish shops and synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
 The years 1937 and 1938 stand out in the playwright's memory. "1937 was the 
year I bought a radio from a friend of mine," recalls Miller, who was a student 
at the University of Michigan at the time. "By sheer accident, I turned it on 
one evening and got Europe. I heard this screaming, and I knew enough German to 
understand vaguely what it was. It was Hitler. The Germans were broadcasting 
the speech worldwide, and it was hysteria. It sounded like a crazy person. That 
was the year before this play takes place." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller graduated in 1938, and the following November came Kristallnacht. "It 
was, historically, the hour when this whole thing exploded with the first 
incredible viciousness," he says. "There'd always been anti-Semitism in Europe 
-- everybody knew that. But the Kristallnacht was the first dramatic thing that 
people were aware of, that told them this was not the old ballgame, that this 
was something new and incredible. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sylvia Gellburg, the protagonist in "Broken Glass," reads about these horrors 
and suddenly finds her legs paralyzed. From her wheelchair, she mixes her anger 
at what's going on in Europe with her own private anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I did with my life!" she cries out to her husband in that signature 
Miller-esque mix of Brooklyn idiom and heightened prose familiar to anyone 
who's ever seen "Death of a Salesman." "Out of ignorance. Out of not wanting to 
shame you in front of other people. A whole life. Gave it away like a couple of 
pennies. I took better care of my shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a voice, a milieu, that Miller's always carried with him. Born in 1915 in 
Harlem, he grew up in a middle-class Jewish family that was financially 
devastated by the Depression. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked in a warehouse for two years to scrape together college tuition and 
at the University of Michigan found his calling as a playwright. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's war diary "Situation Normal" was published in 1944, the same year he 
had his first production in a professional theater -- "The Man Who Had All the 
Luck" -- which ran only four performances. In 1945 his first (and only) novel, 
"Focus," came out, and in 1947 came "All My Sons," his first critical success. 
</P>
<P>
 He's also written a few screenplays and various other works, yet is 
unequivocally most famous for his plays. The most notable of these -- "Death of 
a Salesman," "The Crucible," "A View From the Bridge," "After the Fall" -- are 
considered classics, and others hover near that category. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is also remembered for standing up to the House Un-American Activities 
Committee in 1956, refusing to name names, and for his brief marriage to 
Marilyn Monroe.

 He was first married from 1940-56, to Mary Slattery, then from 1956-60 to 
Monroe, and in 1962 to Morath. He has a son and a daughter by his first 
marriage and a daughter with Morath. He and Morath have collaborated on a 
number of photography books, and his 1987 autobiography, "Timebends," is 
dedicated to her.

 Above all, Miller has always been known as a man of the theater, although it's 
become a harder road to hoe since the 1950s. He is one of the few artists with 
a five-decade overview of Broadway's rise and fall. "I think there was a shift 
in the mid or late '50s," Miller says. "Some part of the population moved out 
of New York, into the suburbs. That solid middle class that was the audience of 
the theater in New York got dispersed." 
</P>
<P>
 But the decline of Manhattan theater was not just a matter of demographics. 
The nature of the theater and plays also changed, he says. "They got to be more 
and more special. The abstract theater moved in. It's a terrifically 
interesting theater, but not for the mass of people. They felt left out. They 
figured it wasn't for them anymore, and they went to the movies, where they 
still got stories, characters and situations they were familiar with." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the atmosphere for theater in this country has never been very 
accommodating, it was once better than it is now. "We had a mythology that 
theater was about prominent values of some kind and show business was something 
else," says Miller. "Theater didn't run as long as show business normally. 
However, everybody assumed that the theater was about matters that had to do 
with the spirit and there was room for that -- small room, but there was room." 
</P>
<P>
 That there is almost no more such room is, according to Miller, simply the 
byproduct of capitalism. "There are virtues to this system, but one of them is 
not the arts," he says. "At the same time, we create more of contemporary art 
in every field than anybody else. We've got an immense population, and, just by 
the law of averages, you get a lot done." 
</P>
<P>
 When it comes to the theater, the lasting literature has been a relatively 
populist one. "Our theater is probably the most popular: Williams, Albee, I and 
a few others have tried to do serious work, but it's been work that was aimed 
at the big audience because it's a democratic country," Miller says. "It wasn't 
aimed at a small clique. There are playwrights who write for a small clique, 
but they don't travel much." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, though, that big audience has become much harder for the stage to reach, 
and revivals are the order of the day. "For a New York producer to take an 
unknown writer and back him, the financial gamble is tremendous," says Miller. 
"So they go for the time-tested stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 There hasn't been much room in Miller's own country for his kind of drama in 
recent years -- although he has continued to have success in England and 
elsewhere. The only time he's been on Broadway in the past couple of decades 
was with 1980's "The American Clock," which lasted only 12 performances. In 
London, however, the same play was nominated for the Olivier award for best 
play. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's 1987 Lincoln Center one-acts, "Danger/Memory!," were not well-liked 
here either. And 1993's "The Last Yankee" was given a tepid reception when it 
opened at the Manhattan Theatre Club, although it went on to an eight-month run 
in London's West End. 
</P>
<P>
 He also blames, as he writes in "Timebends," that "lethal New York combination 
of a single all-powerful newspaper and a visionless if not irresponsible 
theater management, some sectors of which had, yes, profiteered to the point 
where the whole theatrical enterprise was gasping and near death. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 Other problems include getting well-trained actors who are willing to work 
hard for relatively little pay. "It's hard for us to cast plays," Miller says. 
"There's no money in it comparatively. I know one guy on a television show -- 
last week he had six lines for that show, and he gets $40,000 a week. Well, 
there's no way to do that in theater. There's a few of them who are just crazy 
about acting in the theater, but there are not many." 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 A nattily dressed Stanley Kauffmann, the former New York Times theater critic 
and, since 1958, film critic for the New Republic, sits in the Booth Theatre on 
a warm May afternoon, taking in a matinee performance of the latest work by a 
writer who is exactly his own age: 78. This does not happen often. 
</P>
<P>
 Kauffmann calls Miller "a vigorous man who's very interested in the world, a 
compassionate, humane man. How many playwrights in the world are there who, 
while still alive, enter into world repertory as he has? That's inarguable." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Kauffmann also has reservations. "At the same time, he's genuine and 
undisturbing, like an ad for Common Cause," he says. "He's a good, sound 
old-fashioned, traditional moralist -- which is not something to scoff at, but 
neither is it exciting in art. He's really a middle-class homilist." 
</P>
<P>
 Kauffmann's opinions -- which are echoed in the respectful yet qualified 
praise Miller sometimes elicits from American critics -- differ from the 
particularly high regard with which the playwright is held in England. Miller 
regularly travels there to see productions of his plays, and he holds the 
British system in great esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 One key difference between American and British theater is that the latter 
receives government money. "The main thing about British theater is that they 
have these four or five subsidized theaters in London," Miller says. "Since the 
deficits are made up by the government, they can afford to experiment more. 
</P>
<P>
 "They can still play something twice a week to a half-empty house because 
somebody believes that it's valuable. It makes the difference between feeling 
that you're in a world of art or a world of business." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller will travel to London in July for the Aug. 5 opening of "Broken Glass." 
"I have to agree, which I'm delighted to do, to meet that audience in the 
Olivier Theatre, which is immense, for two hours," says Miller. "And they'll 
come and ask questions. The place will be packed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could do it a whole week if I wanted to, and I'm not alone in this," Miller 
continues. "The authors usually do that, and they keep a relationship going 
with that audience. There's a communal feeling about the whole thing. They 
haven't lost the theater culture there yet. I attribute it to the subsidized 
theaters." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also enjoys the ways in which his plays have been received in other 
countries. "Everybody thinks, 'How could they understand "Death of a Salesman" 
in China?' " says Miller. "But everybody forgets that the Chinese invented 
business, about 6,000 years ago, and that the communist era is much less of the 
history of that society." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1983, Miller directed "Death of a Salesman" in Beijing. "Bill Moyers did a 
piece about the play in China," he recalls. "They interviewed a young man 
coming out of the theater, and he said: 'Oh, that Willy Loman, he's right. 
Everybody wants to be No. 1. That Biff, he's all wrong.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Biff represented to him the very serious, rather boring, socially responsible 
guy. Willy represented the future, because they were smelling the scent of 
capitalism. It never dawned on me that of course they would see him as the hero 
who was misunderstood by everybody, including his family." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Miller directed the same play in Stockholm. "We used to think this 
(the expendability of workers, and salesmen) was an American problem, because 
Swedes have had a kind of quasi-socialism where you had a lot of security and 
Willy's getting fired wouldn't happen," he says. "This was the mythology. I 
never believed it. And now all that insecurity is there. They caught up with 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Kauffmann, who recalls first seeing actor Marcello Mastroianni in a 1956 
production of "Death of a Salesman" in Rome directed by filmmaker Luchino 
Visconti, thinks the appeal may be on a more personal level. "You never saw 
Brooklyn look like that in your life," jokes Kauffmann about the staging. "But 
there was something about the father-son struggle -- a recurrent theme -- that 
meant a great deal to them. They take (Miller) abroad as a voice of a certain 
period in American life and history." 
</P>
<P>
 That voice will continue to be heard in theaters around the world, as well as 
in small theaters across this country -- and perhaps even on Broadway again, 
although the climate looks as though it will remain hostile. And Miller will 
continue to write and work in the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his impending trip to London for the National's staging of 
"Broken Glass," Miller is also writing these days. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm working on something," he says. "I don't know whether it's going to be 
fiction or a play. It'll take me a while to find out." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Miller steers his steel-colored sedan back into the parking lot of the 
Southbury bus station. He puts the car in park and insists, despite his 
visitor's protests, on going inside to make sure that there really is a 12:35 
bus going out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to check, so we don't leave you here to rot," he says while 
striding into the comfortably bourgeoise depot, revealing a trace of the Jewish 
mother that lurks in so many Jewish fathers. He then asks a clerk not once, but 
twice, about the bus. Just to make sure. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is, after all, a caretaker -- at once of his guests and of a vision of 
the American theater as a forum for the public conscience. He is also a 
precursor to much younger playwrights like Tony Kushner of "Angels in America" 
fame, whose works are driven by moral imperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet as the younger generation of politically driven theater writers, few 
though they may be, increasingly are lured toward film, the culture of serious 
drama remains in jeopardy. And Arthur Miller may well be the last of a breed. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came in at just the right time," says Kauffmann. "His seemed to me at the 
time to be the best of the flood of plays that were of that strident temper 
that had come along since the Depression. There isn't that kind of belief now. 
There isn't that kind of faith in the future now -- an achievable, perfectable 
future."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: MAYWOOD; BOWMAN NAMED CHIEF OF POLICE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council last week officially hired Police Capt. Gil Bowman as chief 
of the 26-officer Maywood Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowman, a 22-year Police Department veteran and a Maywood native, will move 
into the chief's office upon retirement at the end of the month of Theodore 
Heidke, who has held the city's top law enforcement position for the past 14 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best part of managing the department is (that) you get to carry out your 
ideas," said Bowman, adding that he plans to place more emphasis on getting 
police officers involved in community events.  
</P>
<P>
 The City Council voted 5-0 on Tuesday to hire Bowman, 47, who is married with 
four children. The new chief is expected to earn an annual salary of about 
$72,000, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 A month ago, the council voted 4-0 in favor of hiring Bowman, with 
Councilwoman Elvira Moreno abstaining on the grounds that she did not know 
Bowman well enough to approve the hire. After the councilwoman and candidate 
met and talked, Moreno agreed to support Bowman.  
</P>
<P>
 The second vote Tuesday was held to show unanimous support for the new chief, 
who was the only candidate considered for the job.  
</P>
<P>
 Maywood, which covers a 1.5-square-mile area, and its 28,500 citizens 
represent the highest population density in the state.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of the same problems and the same sort of (criminals) that our 
neighboring cities have," Bowman said. "There were gangs when I started here. . 
. . There used to be more knives and chains and throwing things, now (gang 
members carry) more guns." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, there were two homicides in Maywood and the year before that, 
seven. BOB ELSTON

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: SOUTH GATE; CITY STRIVES TO MAKE $1.1 MILLION IN 
CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are trying to balance the municipal budget for the coming year 
by cutting about $1.1 million without resorting to increased taxes or laying 
off city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 To help make those cuts, City Manager Todd W. Argow has proposed cutting nine 
vacant city jobs, including five civilian positions in the Police Department, 
closing the municipal swimming pool between November and January and for two 
hours each afternoon year-round, and tapping $500,000 in reserve funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The $18.8-million budget for the 1994-95 fiscal year was the subject of a 
public hearing last week and will come up again at the June 28 meeting, when 
the City Council is expected to vote for approval. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials are hoping to hear public opinions on the budget before it gets 
to a final vote. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another budget where the revenues are shrinking some more as a result 
of recession," Argow said. "And it is not easy to maintain city services in a 
city like South Gate (where) the population continues to increase." 
</P>
<P>
 South Gate, a city of about 7.5 square miles, has a population of more than 
90,000. In 1980, it was about 66,000, according to the U.S. Census.  
</P>
<P>
 For the second straight year, Argow will recommend that the 21 top city 
officials pay for their own travel, lodging and food when attending meetings in 
other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will pay only for registration fees to those meetings, such as the 
California League of Cities annual convention that typically draws officials 
from almost every city in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will save thousands of dollars, obviously," Argow said. "Because of the 
scarcity of funds, a lot of us chose not to attend certain meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 Aging equipment and city vehicles will not be replaced "as long as we have 
chewing gum and rubber bands to hold them together," Argow said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the worn roofs on the Police Department, library and City Hall 
buildings will not be repaired next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The budget does not allocate any money for a salary raise for city employees, 
whose contract expires June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 There is one piece of good news.  
</P>
<P>
 The city recently was granted more than $60,000 in federal money to pay half 
the cost to hire two new police officers for the next three years. The city 
will pick up the other half. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a surprise that we got (the money) because of the highly competitive 
nature of funds," the city manager said. BOB ELSTON

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTHEAST: HUNTINGTON PARK; UNIHOSIERY DENIES HARASSING WORKERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attorneys for UniHosiery Inc. have filed a formal denial to all charges 
contained in two lawsuits by Latino workers who have walked off the job to 
protest alleged sexual harassment, racial discrimination and unfair labor 
practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles H. Goldstein, attorney for UniHosiery Inc. and its manager, James 
Paik, last Monday filed in Los Angeles County Superior Court what is 
essentially a point-by-point denial of the allegations. The workers' lawsuits 
were filed a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lawsuits are the tallest tale," Goldstein said. "It is just a tactic, but 
to what end?" 
</P>
<P>
 The bitter dispute pits the Korean management of the sock-making plant against 
65 male Latino workers who formed a picket line outside the business on March 
14. 
</P>
<P>
 In one suit, at least 14 workers accuse Paik and other male company officials 
of sexually assaulting them with tools. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint also alleged that for several years male workers were grabbed in 
the crotch, and, in one instance, a worker was allegedly trapped between the 
prongs of a forklift by a manager while a second supervisor began to remove the 
employee's pants. The plaintiffs are seeking $25,000 each, in addition to 
punitive damages and attorney's fees. 
</P>
<P>
 The second lawsuit asserts that Latino workers have been treated unfairly. The 
claim states that Latino workers were denied overtime pay despite working 
nine-hour days and denied promotions into management positions normally filled 
by Korean workers. All positions of responsibility -- managers, office staff 
and mechanics -- are held by Koreans, and all production work is done by 
Latinos, according to the complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 With the strike in its third month, the workers have installed canopies and 
mobile toilets on the sidewalk outside the plant at 6734 S. Alameda St., an 
indication that they are digging in. 
</P>
<P>
 Striking worker Daniel Sosa, 24, said the mundane routine -- occasionally 
broken by violence -- has taken its toll on those who are camped out on the 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not easy being out here," said Sosa, who is supporting his wife and 
child with the $100 he receives every week for walking the picket line. "There 
is too much sun. We walk for an hour and take turns playing cards to let time 
go by." 
</P>
<P>
 A second group of strikers guards the entrance to UniHosiery's shipping and 
receiving warehouse a few miles away at 321 32nd St. in central Los Angeles. 
Earlier this month, police arrested two men after a verbal confrontation turned 
violent. 
</P>
<P>
 According to both sides, a truck driver delivering goods to the warehouse 
began taunting strikers as he rolled through the picket line. A striker whipped 
off his belt and the driver struck him with an iron bar. Both are facing 
charges of assault with a deadly weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 A rapid sequence of events in March led to the standoff. 
</P>
<P>
 First, someone stole several hundred dollars worth of socks from the plant on 
March 9. Huntington Park police arrested two suspects who claimed to work 
there. Three weeks later, company officials suspended 46 of the 85 Latino 
workers, telling them that their Social Security numbers were questionable. 
</P>
<P>
 The workers claim they were suspended not because of lack of documentation, 
but because they were preparing to organize a union. After the suspensions, all 
85 workers struck and the lawsuits were filed. 
</P>
<P>
 While strikers march outside the gates, UniHosiery has hired six workers to 
join its Korean staff in keeping the plant partially operational. 
</P>
<P>
 International Ladies' Garment Workers Union representatives say that the 
strike will continue until UniHosiery either shuts down or hires back the 
strikers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know the situation," said Steve Nutter, regional director of the union. 
"We would not continue unless we thought this was winnable." 
</P>
<P>
 The National Labor Relations Board is about to complete an investigation of 
alleged unfair labor practices, said Salvadore Sanders, the lead investigator.

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: HIGHLAND PARK; SUN TAKES SPOTLIGHT AT PARK CELEBRATION

<P>
 The summer solstice will be celebrated Saturday at La Tierra de la Culebra, a 
park created out of a vacant lot that involves local youth in gardening, 
sculpting, painting and crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 The free event, from noon to 9:30 p.m., will offer children's arts and crafts, 
storytellers, dancers from Honduras and northern Mexico, Aztec dancing, a jazz 
ensemble of Eagle Rock High School alumni, pre-Columbian music and two plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The summer solstice celebration is to bring to light the importance of the 
growing season," said Tricia Ward, an environmental sculptor and artist who 
started the park, at 240 S. Avenue 57, shortly after the 1992 riots. "Without 
the sun, we could not grow healthy food or a healthy body." 
</P>
<P>
 With a nod from the property owner, who had tried and failed to build 
apartments on the property, Ward and neighborhood youths sifted through 
demolished houses and sculpted a serpent out of the brick and stone. 
</P>
<P>
 They have planted several varieties of trees and flowers and a vegetable 
garden and are rebuilding a pond that had been vandalized last year. They are 
also involved in a mural program to decorate the park.  
</P>
<P>
 The serpent winds through the park, leading visitors up a hill and back down 
to where neighborhood children gather after school to work on crafts. 
</P>
<P>
 With the theme "Healthy Earth, Healthy Body," the event will also offer free 
health screenings, including diabetes, nutrition, HIV testing, pre- and 
post-natal counseling and information on how to stop smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be information on employment services and social security 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuttle buses have been reserved for the day, with pickup points at Montevista 
School on Avenue 54 at noon; Viva Market at York Boulevard and Figueroa Street 
at 12:15 p.m.; Pic & Save at York Boulevard and Avenue 54 at 12:30 p.m. The bus 
will return to the pickup points every hour afterward until 5 p.m. MARY ANNE

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: CITY TERRACE; CURFEW CRACKDOWN HELPS LOWER CRIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Crime and loitering are down in a seven-square-mile area after a Sheriff's 
Department crackdown on young curfew violators. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of neighborhood groups, sheriff's deputies started a pilot 
program in January to ticket curfew violators. Residents complained that too 
many teen-agers and children were out late at night, in some cases tagging 
buses and causing other problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a serious problem and had been asking law enforcement as well as our 
government representatives to do something about this," said Gloria Chavez, 
president of the City Terrace Coordinating Council, "because it was getting to 
a point where many of our people were afraid to go outside, especially on City 
Terrace Drive."  
</P>
<P>
 Over a four-month period, deputies wrote 246 tickets carrying a $675 fine 
each, said Sheriff's Lt. Robert Hoffman. Youths can attend counseling sessions 
and perform community service in lieu of the fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to be working," Chavez said. "Of course, it hasn't totally solved 
the problem, but it has made things easier. We don't see as much loitering." 
</P>
<P>
 For 17-year-old Jose Moreira, being cited for violating curfew has brought a 
turnaround that even he would not have believed just a few months ago. The 
former Roosevelt High School student was with a friend on Valentine's Day when 
the two were cited in City Terrace. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreira was told he would have to complete 200 hours of community service, but 
like most of the teen-agers cited, he was able to reduce those hours by 
improving his grades and working after school. Some youths tutor students at 
Hamasaki Elementary School to work off their hours. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of the staff at Project JADE (Juvenile Assistance Diversion 
Effort), started by the County Probation Department in January at the Centro 
Maravilla service center, Moreira did his homework and improved his attitude. 
He graduated from Montebello High School on Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think if it wasn't for them, I wouldn't be graduating," Moreira said 
Wednesday. "One thing about this program is they help you out, but if they see 
you need extra help, they'll give it to you. I wanted to be helped. I changed 
my life around." 
</P>
<P>
 Since opening in East Los Angeles, Project JADE has counseled about 90 youths 
who have violated curfew or were truant, said coordinator Hector Anaya. Parents 
must attend parenting classes for 10 weeks, and the youths attend counseling 
sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the City Terrace area also asked for and received a sobriety 
checkpoint over the Memorial Day weekend in which the California Highway Patrol 
stopped 344 cars and arrested three people on suspicion of drunk driving, said 
Public Affairs Officer Louis Gutierrez. The checkpoint was at City Terrace 
Drive and Hazard Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHP also cracked down on traffic violations in the unincorporated area of 
City Terrace from May 12-31 after residents complained that drivers were 
speeding near elementary schools. Officers ticketed 120 drivers for speeding, 
failing to heed stop signs and other violations, Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of times we do this as a special request from the residents," Gutierrez 
said. "People were tired of people speeding. There's a few schools in the area 
there, so we went in there and did our thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoffman said the curfew enforcement effort has eased because fewer teen-agers 
are out after hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids know better now," he said. MARY ANNE PEREZ

COMMUNITY NEWS: EAST: LINCOLN HEIGHTS; FESTIVAL TO HIGHLIGHT LATINA ARTISTIC 
TALENT

 Organizers of last year's Expresiones de la Mujer, a festival of women's 
music, poetry, comedy and film, plan to do it again next Sunday afternoon at 
Plaza de la Raza.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year's event attracted so many people that the women from the National 
Latina Alliance, a nonprofit organization, said they felt obligated to hold it 
a second year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year we thought 250 might show up, but there were over 500, and that 
told us that there's a desire to see Latina talent and that we have to keep 
providing it," said organizer Evangeline N. Ordaz, a member of the poetry group 
Y Que Mas? 
</P>
<P>
 The program was designed to mirror and instill pride in a segment of the 
Latino community that Ordaz said rarely sees itself portrayed at all, let alone 
accurately, in the mass media.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is one way to give exposure to the talent that isn't exhibited in the 
normal venues," she said.  
</P>
<P>
 This year's lineup includes two films, a performance art piece, poetry 
readings, music and comedy. Artist Patssi Valdez will design the set, and 
Gloria Romero, a professor of Chicano studies at Loyola Marymount, will be the 
host. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the films, by actress and playwright Evelina Fernandez, who starred in 
"American Me," explores the long friendship between two elderly women. 
Originally a play, the film, "How Else Am I Supposed to Know I'm Still Alive," 
stars Lupe Ontiveros. 
</P>
<P>
 Also appearing are Maria Elena Gaitan, who will perform "Chola con Cello"; 
poetry collective Y Que Mas?; folk rock group Goddess 13; comedienne Cha Cha 
Sandoval, and poet Gloria Alvarez. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Latina Alliance, with about 200 members, started two years ago 
with the goal of reaching out to the Chicana/Latina community through education 
and advocacy.  
</P>
<P>
 The four-hour program will be held outdoors beginning at noon in the Plaza de 
la Raza amphitheater in Lincoln Park, 3540 N. Mission Road. Admission is $5.

COMMUNITY NEWS: SOUTH: SOUTH-CENTRAL; FIRM CLAIMS CHURCH OWES IT $24,000

<P>
 A hearing will be held in Municipal Court next week on a Hawthorne company's 
claim that Mt. Tabor Baptist Church failed to pay a $24,000 bill for 
installation of doors and windows. 
</P>
<P>
 Pedrino Window & Door filed the breach-of-contract lawsuit in June, 1993, 
against the church, the Rev. E. E. Stafford and the church's board of trustees. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute began in December, 1992, after the company installed windows, 
special handicapped hardware and fireproof doors at the church at 6614 Western 
Ave., according to Fran Oatridge, who co-owns the company with her husband, Les 
Oatridge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oatridges allege that the church and Stafford have made no payments on the 
$24,000 bill, despite repeated attempts to establish a payment schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 Stafford and church leaders did not return calls seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a small business and a small business can't afford a $24,000 loss on 
one job in a short time," said Benjamin Robinson, the Oatridges' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Fran Oatridge said the dispute put the family-owned business in 
jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were spending money paying for salaries and material and we weren't 
getting money in," she said. "Pretty soon there were liens on our properties. 
Now we can't charge anything with our creditors and we're just trying to keep 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 The case is scheduled to be heard in Division 3 of Municipal Court June 27.

 In a symbolic gesture linking the Los Angeles Child Guidance Clinic to the 
South-Central area that it serves, more than 200 city officials, business 
people and community leaders tied together strips of ribbons Thursday as part 
of the dedication of the clinic's new facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children in L.A. County have really been the ones to suffer from disasters 
that hit us . . . so a center like this and a place where (clinic staff) can 
provide a sense of guidance is really crucial in L.A.," County Supervisor 
Yvonne Brathwaite Burke said. 
</P>
<P>
 The peach-colored, $9.6-million structure has allowed clinic officials to 
expand services and classes for the more than 100 children, most of them black 
and Latino, use the clinic each day.  
</P>
<P>
 The clinic, which celebrates its 70th anniversary this year, opened at its new 
location on South Vermont Avenue in May. LUCILLE RENWICK

 It is a classroom as inconspicuous as its students. 
</P>
<P>
 Housed in a gray building next to a gas station on Western Avenue, the Shell 
Youth Services Academy trains dozens of teen-agers from South-Central high 
schools for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, when you aren't working, you are sitting at home doing nothing," said 
Dwight Conley, 18, a senior at Manual Arts High School. "I tried getting a job 
at five or six different places, but they always told me I wasn't old enough. 
This is great." 
</P>
<P>
 Conley is among 106 students who graduated from the six-month job-training 
program earlier this month. Now working at a service station as a cashier, 
Conley plans to keep working through the summer and hopes to continue working 
while attending school next year.  
</P>
<P>
 That is exactly what Shell Oil executives had in mind when they started the 
program in March, 1993. Calling it a hands-on response to the 1992 riots, the 
company plans to commit $4 million to the program over four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We like to think we focus on the average student," said Robert A. Russ, a 
spokesman for Shell Oil. "The kids can go either way, and if you push them they 
can be high achievers. But if you let them fall through the cracks, they can 
become gangbangers." 
</P>
<P>
 A 2.2 grade-point average and a steady attendance record are the primary 
requirements to get into the program. In exchange, students receive job 
training and placement, as well as bus passes to and from their workplaces. 
</P>
<P>
 The students from Crenshaw, Dorsey, Fremont, Jefferson, Jordan, Locke, Manual 
Arts and Washington Preparatory high schools receive four hours of classroom 
instruction weekly on topics such as resume writing, job interviews, workplace 
ethics and current events at the academy at 8611 Western Ave. 
</P>
<P>
 Students are then placed in jobs at one of 60 businesses, including the 
Renaissance Hotel, Cedars-Sinai Medical Center and Founders Bank. Students can 
work up to 16 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 The program prompts many students to think about their long-term plans, 
including going to college. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kicking back and having a good time is not going to get me anywhere in life," 
said Angela Griffin, a senior at Crenshaw High School who plans to attend 
Howard University next year. "If it weren't for this place, I'd still be 
looking for a job. Before I got into the academy, I couldn't even get an 
interview." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell officials say the program is so successful -- it boasts a 100% placement 
and retention rate -- that they are considering expanding it to other cities.

COMMUNITY NEWS: DOWNTOWN; CLASS LEAVES BEHIND A 120-NAME SALUTE 
</P>

 Classmates at Ninth Street School may soon forget the faces of this year's 
graduating class of fifth- and sixth-grade students as they move on to various 
middle schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But they're unlikely to forget the 120 names written on the Skid Row campus' 
3-by-10-foot wall representing the future high school classes of 2000 and 2001. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be nice to come back in seven years," said Paloma Perez, 11, a 
fifth-grader, who will enter middle school in the fall when Ninth Street School 
will no longer have sixth-grade students. "It gives us something to be proud 
of." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of an effort to instill campus pride, school officials coordinated the 
wall-signing event with a flag dedication ceremony on Tuesday, Flag Day. 
Community and business groups, police officers and city officials joined Ninth 
Street administrators, staff and students in the celebration. 
</P>
<P>
 The donated flagpole stands on one end of the campus main office, in front of 
the white wall of names. The pole carries a new campus banner of the school 
mascot -- an orange puma mountain lion -- and motto, "The Future Begins Here!" 
</P>
<P>
 School officials hope the new additions to the 10-year-old campus will foster 
a more positive view of the future for the 515 enrolled students -- nearly half 
of whom come from homeless Skid Row families. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Ninth Street School mirrored the surrounding Skid Row blight 
of graffiti and trash. But that image has since been erased with the assistance 
of local community and business groups, which provided funds for graffiti 
paint-out drives, murals on classroom walls and tree plantings around campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The change has been very, very positive," said Charles McCune, who has taught 
at Ninth Street School for four years. "The children have taken more pride in 
the school. They feel like they're really a part of it more so than before." 
</P>
<P>
 "It (also) makes the teachers more proud to work in this environment," McCune 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Though sixth-grader Eric Medina was pleased with the campus pride and 
beautification efforts, he felt more concerned about his own future in society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm kind of nervous," said the 11-year-old. "They're predicting a lot of 
problems -- earthquakes, viruses. If I graduate from high school, it's going to 
be nice." TOMMY LI

COMMUNITY NEWS: DOWNTOWN; OWNER TO SERVE HOUSE ARREST IN OWN HOTEL

<P>
 The elderly owner of a Skid Row hotel has been ordered to serve 30 days under 
house arrest in his own building after failing to maintain it by a 
court-imposed deadline, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chung Chuan Wang is scheduled to turn himself in at the Modoc Hotel, 819 S. 
Towne Ave., by Wednesday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang, who was also fined $10,835, pleaded no contest in March to 10 counts of 
fire, health, and building and safety code violations -- his second conviction 
in five years. Los Angeles Municipal Judge Barry A. Taylor gave him until May 
26 to repair the two-story, 76-room brick hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 During a June 8 hearing, Deputy City Atty. Lawrence P.V. Punter told Taylor 
that repairs to the Modoc Hotel complied with building codes. But health 
inspectors found a violation in the large amount of trash and debris inside a 
vent shaft, which posed a fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang testified that he hired someone to maintain the property, but he couldn't 
remember the contractor's name, said Richard Bobb, supervisor of the city 
attorney's housing enforcement unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Wang faced similar slum charges in 1989, when he pleaded no contest to 12 
counts, was fined $13,138 and ordered to repair the building. In that case, he 
fixed the building but failed to meet the court-imposed deadline and was 
sentenced to perform 1,500 hours of community service and pay additional fines. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say the Modoc Hotel, located across the street from an 
elementary school, is a source of prostitution and other crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's zoning administrator has tentatively scheduled a public hearing for 
Thursday to determine whether to impose conditions on the hotel to resolve the 
problem. TOMMY LI

THE LOST FAITH OF DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN; THE CEREBRAL LIBERAL'S PIVOTAL 
CHANCE TO SHAPE SOCIAL POLICY COMES AT A TIME WEN HE CONFRONTS DOUBTS THAT HE 
-- OR ANYONE -- CAN SOLVE AMERICA'S PROBLEMS 
</P>

Bureau. Times researcher Pat Welch contributed to this report.

<P>
 No one who was in the Cabinet Room on that fall morning could have known it 
then, but they were witnessing the last time that John F. Kennedy would 
publicly exercise what the civics books say is the most basic and important 
power of a President -- signing a bill into law. 
</P>
<P>
 Called the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers 
Construction Act of 1963, it embodied all the optimistic and confident new 
thinking that Kennedy and his youthful Administration had brought to 
Washington. The appeal of this particular legislation had been irresistible, 
even to the conservative Southern warhorses of Capitol Hill, who had blocked 
most of Kennedy's other social initiatives that year. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the plan: An enlightened and compassionate nation would clean out the 
crowded warehouses that had held the retarded and the mentally ill in a 
19th-Century nether world of darkness and isolation. Science had opened the way 
with miraculous new drugs that reclaimed wasted minds. Now, government would do 
its part by building places where those people could find treatment and begin 
productive lives. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mentally ill and the mentally retarded need no longer be alien to our 
affections or beyond the help of our communities," Kennedy said. "I think that 
in the years to come, those who have been engaged in this enterprise can feel 
the greatest source of pride and satisfaction."  
</P>
<P>
 One who was there to hear those words was a relatively unknown 36-year-old 
assistant secretary of labor. He worshiped this President, and though he would 
later serve in more exalted positions for three other chief executives, he 
would look back and write: "Kennedy had been 'my' President in a way that 
happens only once." 
</P>
<P>
 His President even gave him one of the fountain pens with which he had signed 
the bill. Nestled on red velvet, it is framed in gold with a card inscribed: 
"This pen was used by President Kennedy in signing Public Law Number 88-164, 
October 31, 1963, and presented to Daniel P. Moynihan." 
</P>
<P>
 Three decades later, that pen hangs in the conference room behind the Senate 
Finance Committee chamber. In that proverbial back room, the committee that 
many consider the most powerful in Congress will give shape to the heart of 
President Clinton's domestic agenda: health care and welfare reform. 
</P>
<P>
 To Chairman Pat Moynihan, the pen is no mere souvenir. He believes that it set 
into motion a national tragedy. The asylums emptied out, but the government 
never built the 2,000 community centers that were supposed to be in place by 
1980; it stopped at a woefully short 482. And as a result, the 
deinstitutionalized mentally ill were literally left out in the cold. They were 
free all right, Moynihan has said. "They might henceforth sleep in doorways as 
often as they chose. The problem of the homeless appeared, characteristically 
defined as persons who lacked 'affordable housing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The cautionary tale of the pen, then, is that not even the smartest, most 
well-meaning people can anticipate all the consequences of their actions. Its 
moral is that, trying to solve one problem by dismantling the system that 
surrounds it may sometimes produce only a different kind of misery. 
</P>
<P>
 Many social scientists would disagree with Moynihan's analysis that the 
complex problem of homelessness can be blamed on that single piece of 
legislation, but there is no doubting the New York Democrat's conviction. "It's 
been absolutely catastrophic," he says, "a tribute to ignorance and all that is 
wrong, and it would never have happened if we hadn't set out to improve 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 "If we hadn't set out to improve things . . . " Moynihan tells the story so 
often that some senators are beginning to find it tiresome. It bears repeating 
here, because it begins to explain the reading of history that shapes 
Moynihan's fears for the future. It helps explain the things about Moynihan 
that are often written off as eccentricity or whimsy: the penchant for 
launching verbal neutron bombs at the Clinton team; the fits of pique that have 
strained his relationship with many of his Democratic colleagues; the 
reluctance to write a health-care bill, despite enormous pressure from the 
White House and Congress' Democratic leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 To some, it seems that Pat Moynihan is standing in the way of his President 
and of his party. "He is brilliant. He is extraordinary in his breadth and 
depth of knowledge on issues, but it's difficult to take that knowledge and 
experience and create a leadership role out of it," says one senator. "He is 
less than successful in presenting solutions, whether it's health care or 
welfare reform." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan comes into this enormous power at a time when his party -- the 
Democratic Party that he will proudly tell you is the oldest political 
organization on earth -- has its first chance in more than a decade to change 
the direction of the country. Yet he finds himself isolated among his party's 
liberal leaders, holding to the sensibilities of another era. "Moynihan 
represents the now-forgotten complex liberalism of the 1950s," says historian 
Fred Siegel, a fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute, which calls itself a 
New Democratic think tank. "The liberalism since then has been, by and large, 
enthusiastic in a religious sense, and simple-minded. That older liberalism was 
cerebral, contemplative, more aware, in the wake of the disasters of 
totalitarianism, of how difficult it is to change people without creating ugly 
side effects." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan, says Siegel, is "not just skeptical of bureaucracy. He's skeptical 
of the capacity of social work to replace the family, and he's been proven 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as people ask Pat Moynihan for the answers, this man who has been so 
certain about so many things seems to be able to say only that he does not have 
them. He does not believe anyone else does either. 
</P>
<P>
 He has power now. But what does that mean when one has lost his confidence in 
what government can do -- or worse, his faith in what it should do? His 
instincts and his experience seem to be telling him to be wary of grandiose 
schemes that wrap themselves in the banner of liberal activism. But any 
Democratic politician must also understand that squeamishness now could mean a 
historic opportunity missed. 
</P>
<P>
 A close friend puts it this way: "I think Pat is struggling with these two 
sides of his political being. The two sides of his nature -- the intellectual 
side and the political side -- grind like tectonic plates right along a fault 
line. He manages as well as he can." 
</P>
<P>
 GIVEN THE HOLD OF THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE OVER SO MUCH that is dear to 
Clinton, it is not surprising that White House officials are not particularly 
eager to criticize the chairman on the record. But the way in which they refuse 
to comment is telling in itself.

 "Why add where there's problems aplenty?" one normally chatty aide snaps, 
hastily hanging up the phone. 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan originally regarded Clinton as the best thing to happen to the 
national government since Kennedy. As a candidate, the Arkansas governor had 
sounded many of the themes that Moynihan had been preaching for years -- ideas 
such as personal responsibility and a rejection of the notion that more 
government spending was the answer to every social problem. "I have to say I 
like the idea of a 46-year-old governor coming to Washington with a zest for 
new ideas," Moynihan wrote his constituents shortly before the presidential 
election. "It is just possible that we are going to see one of those periods of 
high energy here in the national government. Anyone who was here in Washington 
during the Kennedy years will never forget them." 
</P>
<P>
 It must have seemed to Moynihan that Clinton could be the President who would 
bring the Democrats out of the ideological wilderness where they had been 
wandering since Jimmy Carter. And perhaps his infatuation might have continued 
and grown, had lightning not struck. As one senator -- albeit one who was a 
member of the Finance Committee -- he could have continued to play his roles of 
gadfly and sage, without challenging the Clinton agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Clinton decided to tap Finance Committee Chairman Lloyd Bentsen to be 
his Treasury secretary, by virtue of seniority, Moynihan moved up to assume the 
leadership of one of the most headstrong committees on Capitol Hill. Suddenly, 
Moynihan's ideas counted. 
</P>
<P>
 There were more than a few whispers that Moynihan might not be up to the job 
he inherited from the cool, patrician Bentsen, who had run the committee with 
the grip of a board chairman. At 67, and approaching the end of three terms in 
office, Moynihan still seems the flighty Harvard professor, his limp white 
forelock flying as he lopes onto the Senate floor to deliver his lectures. If 
the question of the moment is the Mideast peace process, Moynihan launches into 
the division of the Ottoman Empire after World War I; if it is economics, he 
explains the calculations that go into determining national income. 
</P>
<P>
 His vision and insight are undeniable. When his peers were still celebrating 
the victories of the civil-rights marchers in the South, he was pointing to the 
North, to the cities where the black family was losing its battle to a more 
intractable enemy. When America was stockpiling arms for the ultimate nuclear 
clash, he was a decade ahead of events with his prediction that the Soviet 
Union would kill itself. When Ronald Reagan incited Republicans and Democrats 
to a bidding war to see who could cut taxes faster, it was Moynihan who foresaw 
the resulting deficits that could cripple government for generations. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a man who has seen many disasters," says historian Siegel. "If you were 
going to sum up the tragedy of Pat Moynihan, it's that he's a man who saw much 
better than those around him, but nonetheless hasn't been able to stop the 
course of history." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan's personal creed is the French Catholic novelist Georges Bernanos' 
observation that the worst, most corrupting lies are problems poorly stated, 
and for all these years, he has been trying to help explain what is wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 But chairmen of important congressional committees are judged not on how well 
they understand problems; they are expected to know how to fix them. Over the 
years, Moynihan had come to be regarded by colleagues as their in-house 
intellectual, one whose ideas were intriguing, but rather off the mark 
politically. His legislative skills were largely untested, with a massive 1991 
surface transportation bill being the only major legislation that he had ever 
steered through a difficult floor fight. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was always the question of his drinking. In Washington, Moynihan has 
a reputation as a lush, which is reinforced by the perpetual flush of his 
cheeks and an odd manner of speaking that is somewhere between a splutter and a 
lisp. Of all the raps against Moynihan, this is the one that annoys his 
admirers the most. "He drinks much less than I do, and has for a long time," 
says Washington super-lawyer Leonard Garment, an old friend. "He couldn't do 
the things he does, and has done. He couldn't write a book every summer. It's 
all so silly, that business as if he is Mr. Hiccup." 
</P>
<P>
 From the start, it appeared that the Clinton White House was ready to dismiss 
Moynihan as a legislative lightweight. Indeed, through the transition and the 
early weeks of the Administration, neither the President nor any of his top 
staffers even bothered to get in touch with the new chairman of the most 
pivotal committee in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, it seemed to Moynihan that the Clinton team was giving short 
shrift to welfare reform, an issue he cares about over all others. During his 
campaign, Clinton had vowed to "end welfare as we know it." Once he was 
elected, however, it quickly became clear that welfare reform would take a back 
seat to health care, a topic in which Moynihan had never evinced much interest. 
</P>
<P>
 His mounting irritation boiled over the week before the inauguration, when 
Donna Shalala, Health and Human Services secretary nominee, focused on health 
to the virtual exclusion of welfare at her confirmation hearing before 
Moynihan's committee. Setting what was to become the tone for his relations 
with the new Administration, Moynihan made the devastating suggestion that he 
could hear "the clatter of campaign promises being tossed out the window." 
</P>
<P>
 After Clinton was in office, things got worse. An unidentified official at the 
White House suggested to Time magazine columnist Michael Kramer that Moynihan 
did not have a grip on the Finance Committee, and added: "He's not one of us. . 
. . We'll roll right over him if we have to."  
</P>
<P>
 Yet when the time came last year for his first big test as chairman, Moynihan 
delivered the votes to keep Clinton's economic plan alive. Even then, however, 
there were whispers that it was actually Majority Leader George J. Mitchell of 
Maine who had done the heavy lifting, and the White House privately blamed 
Moynihan, though perhaps unfairly, for losing its proposed BTU tax.  
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan's relationship with the Clinton Administration hasn't jelled into 
anything that resembles trust or comfort. "He drives the White House nuts," 
groans one Democratic congressman. "They have no idea where he's going to come 
from hour to hour, day to day." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan was the first Democrat to support the appointment of a prosecutor to 
look into the Whitewater affair. He said that the Administration policy on 
Bosnia is "shredding the entire legal order that we put into place at the end 
of World War II." He described Clinton's tepid statements on welfare reform as 
"boob bait for the bubbas." 
</P>
<P>
 But none of Moynihan's comments have been as damaging as the ones about 
health-care reform. His word for Clinton's financing scheme was "fantasy." The 
First Couple's apocalyptic rhetoric, he suggested, was hype: "We don't have a 
health-care crisis in this country. We do have a welfare crisis." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan even threatened to hold health care hostage unless he saw some action 
on welfare reform, and the President had no choice but to pay the ransom. The 
White House went to work on a welfare proposal, despite warnings from others in 
Congress that it risked throwing the lawmaking machinery into overload. Now it 
appears that Congress will not take a serious look at the issue until next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Over and over, Moynihan pushes the button that plunges the White House into 
the spin cycle. Administration officials clench their teeth, face the cameras 
and suggest once again that the chairman's complex views can easily lend 
themselves to misinterpretation. As much a part of the ritual are the 
chairman's practiced expressions of bewilderment that anything he has said 
could have created such a fuss. For, after all, Moynihan insists, he was only 
stating the obvious. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally apparent to Moynihan is the need to bring Republicans -- and 
specifically their leader, Bob Dole -- into the action on health care. Working 
with only a two-vote Democratic majority on the Finance Committee, Moynihan 
knows that if even one on his side bolts, he loses. And looking ahead, the 
fight on the Senate floor would be easier if he could claim that he has 
bipartisan support. 
</P>
<P>
 "This bill is going to be a bipartisan bill. Any bill that drives off all the 
Republicans, save one or two, also scares off at least 10 Democrats," says Sen. 
Bob Packwood (R-Ore.), a good friend of Moynihan and a former Finance Committee 
chairman himself. 
</P>
<P>
 As the chairman finds growing support and admiration from Republicans, he is 
becoming increasingly isolated from his own party. In a recent speech, Sen. 
John D. (Jay) Rockefeller IV (D-W.Va.), a Finance Committee member and one of 
Clinton's most ardent health-care allies, warmly praised fellow Democrats who 
have not "dodged the bullet." Notably absent from a list that included all the 
major Democratic players with jurisdiction over health care was Rockefeller's 
own chairman -- Moynihan. It was only one more sign that Democratic leaders are 
doing their best to steer as much of the health-care action as possible away 
from him. 
</P>
<P>
 His first setback came when Sen. Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.), chairman of the 
Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee and a champion of health-care reform 
since the 1970s, refused to cede the entire bill to the Finance Committee. 
Although the White House was rooting for Kennedy, Clinton pointedly stayed 
outside what amounted to a nasty family fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the turf battle over health care has sorely strained the relationship 
between Moynihan and the brother of the President he so admired. At the final 
moment before the bill was formally introduced last year, Kennedy prevailed 
through his superior mastery of the complicated Senate rules, leading Moynihan 
to threaten to publicly denounce Kennedy and to label the Clinton health plan a 
huge tax increase in disguise. (Kennedy and Moynihan's staff members deny that 
such an episode occurred, but sources from the White House and Capitol Hill 
insist that it did.)  
</P>
<P>
 Unable to bring Moynihan under control, Majority Leader Mitchell was forced to 
abandon his plans to make a splashy event of the formal introduction of the 
biggest piece of legislation since the Great Depression. He submitted the bill 
to the Senate parliamentarian late on a weekend night, marking the occasion 
with only a written statement for the Congressional Record. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the efforts to cut Moynihan out of the action have only 
intensified. Behind the scenes, some Democrats have formed a private network 
that has been meeting feverishly. Not that he would care. Moynihan and his 
alter ego, Chief of Staff Lawrence O'Donnell Jr., rarely show up even for 
strategy sessions at the White House. "I've never been to a meeting in 
Washington outside the Finance or Ways and Means conference rooms that involved 
more than three people and accomplished anything," O'Donnell told National 
Journal magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, also a member of the Finance Committee, is taking greater command. 
Having announced that he will retire at the end of this year, Mitchell wants to 
end his Senate career with a victory that will be regarded as nothing short of 
historic. He even turned down a chance at the Supreme Court so that he could 
devote his energies to seeing this bill through. 
</P>
<P>
 The tensions are evident. On one April weekend, Mitchell gathered his 
Democratic troops in Virginia for an in-depth discussion of their options on 
health reform. Right up until the last minute, sources say, it was unclear 
whether the Finance Committee chairman would even participate. At a subsequent 
closed-door luncheon where Mitchell presented Democrats with another set of 
health-care choices, Moynihan put in an appearance, then left after only a few 
minutes -- ensuring that reporters, to whom he selectively doles out interviews 
(he would not grant an interview for this story), would note his exit. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Kennedy was working behind the scenes with Mitchell and the White 
House to produce his own health-care bill. Weeks before Moynihan's committee 
had even had its first official vote on the bill, Kennedy's was well under way. 
But it would be folly to believe Moynihan will not have his day. "They will not 
run over Pat. If this becomes a head-to-head battle, Pat will win," Packwood 
says. "I get awfully tired of people who underrate Pat." 
</P>
<P>
 TO CHALK UP ALL THESE EPISODES TO MOYNIHAN'S CANTANKEROUSNESS IS to ignore his 
personal history -- a political evolution that has often been well ahead of his 
party and of American society itself. "We're getting up on 40 years of 
high-level public service, and he hasn't forgotten a minute of it," says James 
Q. Wilson, UCLA professor of management and public policy, who has known 
Moynihan almost that long.  
</P>
<P>
 When politics and expediency would dictate that he move one way, Moynihan can 
be expected to go the other. He went right when the country moved left in the 
1960s, and headed the other way with Ronald Reagan's election in the '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 Time has often proven that his vision was truer than that of those around him, 
but vindication has not come without cost. Moynihan has never really recovered 
from the most searing experience of his life: the backlash against his 
now-famous March, 1965, report to President Lyndon B. Johnson on the Negro 
family. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States is approaching a new crisis in race relations," the 
assistant labor secretary wrote in the Moynihan Report. It proceeded to paint 
ghetto family life with a litany of brutal statistics that today have grown to 
staggering proportions: broken marriages, illegitimate births, households 
headed by women, drug addiction, unemployment, poverty. Others had seen these 
problems as well, but Moynihan was the first to wrap them in data -- and more 
important, the first to try to force a national policy debate over them. It 
was, he wrote later, "the best work I had ever done, or would do." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet the reaction was hardly what Moynihan had expected. Writer Nicholas Lemann 
has noted in his book on black migration to the North: "Because Moynihan had 
left out the solutions, and because the press had concentrated on the parts of 
the report that dealt with out-of-wedlock childbearing and ignored the parts 
about unemployment, it was possible to perceive it as a brief for doing nothing 
to help the black poor . . . because the straits they were in were of their own 
devising." 
</P>
<P>
 Boston psychologist William Ryan leveled the most stinging description of what 
Moynihan had done, the label that would stick: "blaming the victim." 
</P>
<P>
 An embittered Moynihan returned to New York, lost a race for City Council 
president and retreated to a teaching job at Harvard. He blamed the liberals 
for what had happened to him. Not his kind of liberal, of the more cerebral, 
more contemplative, more subtle tradition. He blamed the kind of liberal who 
had come to populate the New Left, whose power he said was "as rigid and 
destructive as any force in American life." 
</P>
<P>
 The Moynihan Report and its fallout represent "a seminal moment in the decline 
of American liberalism. It was at that moment that liberalism began to 
substitute pieties for problem-solving," says historian Siegel. 
</P>
<P>
 It was also the moment that it became apparent the once-comfortable label of 
liberal would never fit Moynihan again. It would appear that his ideology is a 
moving target, but it is more likely that he's simply outpacing the rest of the 
country. In 1979, the Nation magazine called his "the conscience of a 
neo-conservative," but when that movement was at its zenith two years later, 
the New Republic was featuring "Pat Moynihan, neo-liberal." 
</P>
<P>
 "Pat has always been what you might call a revisionist progressive," says the 
neo-conservative guru Irving Kristol, who has known Moynihan since the 1950s. 
"He comes out of the progressive Democratic movement in New York City, and he's 
always thought of himself as progressive. On the other hand, he's been involved 
in government long enough to be disillusioned with a lot of things government 
tries to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Moynihan Report was only the first of his bitter battles with the left. To 
the horror of his liberal friends at Harvard, Moynihan returned to Washington 
to join the Administration of Richard M. Nixon. His title was assistant to the 
President for urban affairs, a sort of domestic version of Henry Kissinger. 
Once again, a memo that he wrote to the President touched off a firestorm -- 
this one including a widely misinterpreted recommendation that the 
Administration abandon its confrontational approach to racial issues and 
instead assume a posture of "benign neglect." 
</P>
<P>
 To Moynihan, it seemed that it had become impossible to engage in any kind of 
discussion that involved race. "A certain kind of liberal conviction fixed on 
this issue," he recalled. "The Administration was irredeemably damned, and so 
was I." 
</P>
<P>
 On that score, it would seem that Moynihan might have found a political soul 
mate in Bill Clinton, who two decades later ran as a "New Democrat," 
repudiating much of what the liberals in his party had come to represent. But 
Moynihan cannot help but hear echoes of that older version of party dogma in 
those who populate the Administration and the programs they bring before his 
committee. Both First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and Shalala had been leaders 
of the Children's Defense Fund, which unsuccessfully fought his welfare reform 
legislation in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 That law was the most far-reaching overhaul of the welfare system in half a 
century, and included work-training requirements for welfare recipients as well 
as tighter enforcement of child-support orders. Presumably, it should form the 
basis for the next wave of welfare reforms. But Moynihan has little confidence 
in how the Clinton team will build on his earlier work. Last month, he told New 
York magazine: "Half the people they appointed had opposed the Welfare Reform 
Act of 1988." 
</P>
<P>
 It is on welfare reform that Moynihan sees the deepest betrayal of liberalism 
by liberals. He still carries the scars he suffered from his fight during the 
Nixon years for the Family Assistance Plan. "It was one of the worst 
disappointments of his life," says Maura Moynihan, his daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea of the Family Assistance Plan was a radical one -- giving government 
money outright to families, rather than pouring it into their communities or 
providing them an array of government services. It was a remarkable thing to 
have persuaded a Republican President to support, but then, Moynihan had a 
special way with Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 For all their ideological differences, the President and his urban affairs 
adviser found a bond in the struggles and humiliations of having grown up poor. 
Late afternoons often would find Nixon and Moynihan chatting in the Oval 
Office. Moynihan shared and nurtured Nixon's vision of leaving a social legacy 
that would be compared with that of the 19th-Century Tory statesman Benjamin 
Disraeli. In his memos to Nixon, Moynihan would paint every important policy 
decision as one on which history would be made. Later, Moynihan would say that 
Nixon was "the most civil man I ever worked for." 
</P>
<P>
 Moynihan blamed the liberals in Congress for blocking the Family Assistance 
Plan -- not because they believed it was flawed, but because they wanted to 
deny a Republican President the credit for bettering the lives of the poor. 
Garment, then counsel to the President, remembers going with Moynihan to 
Capitol Hill when the legislation was losing steam, and Nixon seemed prepared 
to give it one last push. Again and again, lawmakers of the left asked them: 
"Why should we give this to Richard Nixon?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We saw the arrogance of power in very concrete terms," Garment says. "It was 
really, truly despicable." 
</P>
<P>
 While Moynihan defended the concept for years, experiments in the 1970s showed 
that giving people money actually contributed to the breakup of families. That, 
too, is a lesson that he carries into the issues he faces today. 
</P>
<P>
 "He knows we don't know what to do. He knows we don't know how to remake a 
broken family, or prevent a teen-age girl from becoming a mother. He knows we 
do not know how to end welfare dependency at some humane price," says one 
friend. "Yet, he is required to act as if he knows. You can't say as a senator 
-- much less as a chairman of the Senate Finance Committee -- that we do not 
know how to do these things, and therefore, we shouldn't do anything." 
</P>
<P>
 FOR MOYNIHAN, THE PROBLEMS of the welfare system illuminate a far deeper 
source of this nation's social deterioration -- the vast and growing number of 
fatherless families. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is one unmistakable lesson in American history: a community that allows 
a large number of young men to grow up in broken families, dominated by women, 
never acquiring . . . any set of rational expectations about the future -- that 
community asks for and gets chaos," Moynihan wrote in a magazine article 
several months after his infamous report to Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Though he likes to discuss the problem in terms of data and trends, Moynihan's 
experience with the broken family is far more personal. His own father -- a 
publicist with a fondness for drinking, women and racetracks -- abandoned the 
family when Pat was 10, and his eldest son never saw him again. Moynihan does 
not like to talk about the more intimate experiences of his childhood. Even his 
daughter, Maura, says she doesn't know the full story. "He never dwelled on 
it," she says. "He's never been into being a victim." 
</P>
<P>
 But there survive some glimpses of how deeply it affected him. Political 
consultant Douglas Schoen opened a 1979 biography of Moynihan by quoting 
something the future senator wrote when he was about 22: "I've lived much of my 
life in a jungle of broken families, watching them tear out each other's minds, 
watching them feasting on each other's hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Moynihan and her three children bounced from one spot to another, 
hitting bottom in the brawling waterfront section of Manhattan known as Hell's 
Kitchen. As a youngster, Pat shined shoes around Times Square. He recalls 
hearing about the first major news event of his life, the bombing of Pearl 
Harbor, from a man whose shoes he was shining on Central Park West. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother married several times, in vain hope of finding financial security. 
Ultimately, she bought a saloon, where Pat could often be found tending the 
bar. As a teen, he also worked several months as a stevedore. Moynihan has 
claimed that he never seriously considered going to college, and insists he 
took the City College entrance exam "only to prove to myself that I was as 
smart as I thought I was." 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1966 interview with the New York Times, Moynihan -- then at Harvard -- 
related: "I swaggered into the test room with my longshoreman's loading hook 
sticking out of my back pocket. I wasn't going to be mistaken for any sissy 
college kid. But I passed the test and decided to go to City -- and that was 
the beginning of a lot of things in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 The tale may have a bit of embroidery around the edges. In researching the 
biography, Schoen discovered that Moynihan was never required to take an 
entrance exam at City College, although he did have to pass one a year later to 
get into the Navy's officer training program. 
</P>
<P>
 Navy training took him to Vermont's Middlebury College, where he ran with a 
group of rich kids. He graduated with a BA from Tufts University in Boston on 
the GI Bill. At 23, he won a Fulbright Scholarship that took him to England and 
the London School of Economics. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted to go into the foreign service, but the man who would be ambassador 
to India for Nixon and the United Nations for Gerald R. Ford (and editor- or 
author-to-be of 16 books) flunked the composition portion of the exam. So he 
found his way into state government and the administration of New York Gov. 
Averell Harriman. 
</P>
<P>
 It was while working for Harriman that he met Elizabeth Brennan, whom he 
married in 1955. A secretary, she worked alongside him in an office outside 
Harriman's. Liz, an accomplished architectural historian, has run her husband's 
campaigns and is his closest adviser. They have three grown children. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1963, the family home has been Pindars Corners, a town that is little 
more than a traffic light in Upstate New York. At Derrymore, their farm, the 
bookshelves by his bed are jammed with German, French and Italian volumes. 
Moynihan's idea of a vacation is to go to an old schoolhouse on the property 
and spend at least six hours a day writing his books on a 25-year-old electric 
typewriter.  
</P>
<P>
 THESE DAYS, HOWEVER, Moynihan's chances to retreat to his typewriter and his 
world of ideas are fewer. For in the intellectual's heart there lives a street 
pol -- more particularly, one who is seeking reelection this year. Watching 
Moynihan on the stump is to be reminded that he got his first lessons in 
politics during the waning days of New York's Tammany Hall clubhouses. 
</P>
<P>
 In late March, hundreds of Upstate New Yorkers jammed into the fire station of 
the little town of Chatham to let their senator hear their concerns firsthand. 
With delight, Moynihan pointed out that one of his questioners had been his 
insurance agent for more than 30 years and that another had been a colleague 
from his days in the Harriman Administration. When one elderly woman said she 
was fearful that federal subsidies for her retirement home would be cut, he 
assured her: "We'll find out about this, and it won't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're wonderful," she sighed. 
</P>
<P>
 He took pains to assure his constituents that, despite his leadership role in 
health-care reform, he would defend his home-state interests. "My concern in 
this bill is, first of all, to look after New York," Moynihan said, adding that 
the ultimate legislation would reverse some of the old Medicaid formulas that 
have worked in favor of the South at the expense of northeastern states, and 
would protect big teaching hospitals and research centers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the professor in Moynihan kept creeping in as well -- often to the obvious 
mystification of his audience. When one questioner asked about his comments 
critical of health-care reform, Moynihan quoted Bernanos' theory about problems 
poorly stated, and pleaded guilty. When another asked about drug policy, he 
noted that the Harrison Act of 1914 had described heroin as a stimulant. And, 
of course, he told the story of the Kennedy pen once again. 
</P>
<P>
 In his reelection bid, Moynihan is being challenged in the September primary 
by the Rev. Al Sharpton, a flamboyant black activist whose name is almost as 
well known as Moynihan's in New York City. (The Republican candidate is 
Bernadette Castro.) No one gives Sharpton much of a chance of winning, but he 
has succeeded in reviving the tensions between Moynihan and blacks that have 
never been far from the surface. A significant number of the state's black and 
Latino elected officials have endorsed Sharpton, saying Moynihan has long 
neglected them. Indeed, some say, when they want something done for them in 
Washington, they go to their Republican senator, Alfonse D'Amato. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do not need an academician. We need a fighter, and Moynihan is not a 
fighter," Sharpton says. "Any time a man is unchallenged, and can sit around 
writing books more than legislation, then he becomes a captive of his own 
academic world of theory, rather than the practical world that his constituents 
have to live in." 
</P>
<P>
 THE DOMAIN OVER WHICH MOYNIHAN reigns is an uncomfortably chilly, muted green 
chamber where 20 white men sit in a semicircular dais and face a table of 
witnesses under the glare of television lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Since September, a procession of experts -- ranging from Hillary Rodham 
Clinton to her nemeses in the medical and insurance industries -- have argued 
their views here in 31 hearings on health-care reform. This, in many ways, was 
the Socratic Moynihan at his best and his most comfortable. As he explored the 
failings of the current system, the chairman also made sure that his committee 
took note of the fact that American medicine has a record of breathtaking 
achievements as well -- a single set of anti-peptic acid drugs, for example, 
that has dramatically reduced the need for surgery. And at almost every 
session, he found a way to work in the most famous advice attributed to 
Hippocrates, the Greek physician of antiquity: First, do no harm. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the final hearings was on May 10, and fittingly, it brought the 
chairman back to the point where, for him, the entire debate had started. The 
subject was deinstitutionalization and mental health, and, for the occasion, 
Moynihan had taken the gold frame down from its spot of honor on the wall of 
the conference room, and brought it into the chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Waving it above his head, he launched again into his tale of remorse -- "a 
reminder of the cost of good intentions. To make great changes is to invite 
large disturbances. We would hope we would be a lot more careful in this health 
legislation than we were a generation ago." 
</P>
<P>
 Tellingly, Packwood and one other Republican were the only Finance Committee 
members there to hear it. Not a single Democratic colleague had bothered to 
show up. They probably knew he would start in again about that pen.

CITY TIMES COVER STORY; CUP FEVER

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 THERE'S NOTHING IN the world like it. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time it's over, it will have touched the hearts of one-third of the 
planet's population. Two billion people. One event: the World Cup soccer 
championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Every four years, one country transforms itself into the soccer capital of the 
planet. This summer, the United States is host, and the worldwide television 
audience is expected to reach more than an aggregate 30 billion during the 
monthlong event. From a field of 24 teams playing in nine stadiums across the 
nation, two will meet in the final match at the Rose Bowl in Pasadena on July 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 For many Angelenos, this, the globe's largest single-sport event, remains a 
curious sideshow meriting less attention than David Letterman coming to town to 
boost his sweeps-week ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 But not so for thousands in Central Los Angeles, where many communities have 
high concentrations of immigrants who have brought their deep love of the sport 
from their native lands. A microcosm of the frenzy that has swept the world, 
neighborhoods such as South-Central, Pico-Union, East Los Angeles and Koreatown 
are rife with nationalistic pride and American commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors sell flags and pennants of the United States, Mexico, Brazil, Nigeria 
and others in the Cup field to soccer fans eager to pledge their allegiance. 
Shouts and cheers spill from restaurants and bars where the games play on 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical is the Little Siberia bar in Huntington Park, where walls plastered 
with Cup posters and photos act as a backdrop to standing-room-only crowds 
intensely watching a futbol match. 
</P>
<P>
 For soccer followers here and from abroad, the spectacle transcends 
everything. 
</P>
<P>
 Children around the globe dream of becoming soccer heroes like Colombia's 
Carlos Valderrama or Brazil's Romario in the same tradition American youths 
aspire to become the next Joe Montana or Michael Jordan.  
</P>
<P>
 World Cuppers live to see the clash of divergent styles of soccer: the 
artistry of the Brazilians; the precision of the Germans; the elegance of the 
Italians or the pageantry of the Colombians. 
</P>
<P>
 Cameroonians, meanwhile, roar for their "Indomitable Lions." Spaniards cheer 
their toreros with " Ole !" Dutch fans count on the clockwork of their orange 
team.  
</P>
<P>
 The Super Bowl, the World Series and the NBA finals: Combine the passion and 
glory of these events and it's only a glimpse of what the finals are for the 
most popular sport in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing like the World Cup. Not one thing.

CITY ARTS; MORE THAN THE BLUES

<P>
 The music and stories of the black experience are among the highlights of this 
year's Juneteenth celebration today at the William Grant Still Community Arts 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Performances will include a broad spectrum of sounds ranging from early 
spirituals, gospel, classical music and the works of contemporary African 
American composers, including William Grant Still. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebration, commemorating the day Texas slaves finally learned they had 
been emancipated, also includes storytelling and a gospel workshop. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the artists performing Still's work will be the Afro-American Chamber 
Music Society, accompanied by soprano Celeste Headlee, the composer's 
granddaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Still's diverse compositions drew on classical, blues and jazz traditions.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1931 his work, "The Afro-American," was the first full symphony by a black 
composer to be performed by a major orchestra, in Rochester, N.Y. Still, who 
died in 1978, also wrote several operas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think much of the African American experience in music has been 
pigeonholed. We are more than blues. We have a rich history in classical 
music," said Bobbee Zeno, who is helping produce a musical segment of the 
program.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dr. Still was a great composer." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The free concerts begin at 2 p.m. at the William Grant Still Community Arts 
Center, 25230 W. View Street. Information: (213) 734-1164. SANDRA HERNANDEZ

A DIFFICULT CELEBRATION; A VOICE FROM 'THE GENERATION OF THE INCOMPLETE' 
CONTEMPLATES THE STATE OF THE GAY NATION 25 YEARS AFTER THE STONEWALL UPRISING 
THAT LAUNCHED A MOVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Paul Monette, Paul Monette is the author of 12 books, three of which form an 
autobiography: Borrowed Time: An AIDS Memoir, Becoming a Man and the recently 
published Last Watch of the Night, from which this piece was adapted. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As we come up on the 25th anniversary of Stonewall -- that is, the June 28-29 
Stonewall riots in Greenwich Village, the watershed moment in the struggle for 
gay and lesbian freedom -- I find my own capacity for celebration more subdued 
than I would like. Tempered by caution, almost rueful. Not that I ever cease to 
honor those nights of resistance, the bottles lobbed and the air thick with 
catcalls as a ragtag band of bar queens made it clear they'd had enough of 
police harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing would ever be quite the same afterward. The wall-eyed thugs in NYPD 
blue proved to have an abysmal feel for historic moment. They never seemed to 
get it that they'd overstepped their bounds on a Holy Day, that the queers were 
inconsolable that night, having just heard that Judy Garland -- the divas' diva 
-- had taken her last vault over the rainbow. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Stonewall 25, I'm afraid it's entirely personal, my sense of being a 
wallflower at the festival. Recently, I tottered home from Italy and 10 days' 
cavort in the ruins of Rome and immediately took to bed. A bad mix of back 
spasm and a siege of bronchitis, a cough that kept my sacroiliac in a constant 
state of white-hot pain. And not much comforted by my doc's assurances that 
this nexus of symptoms, at least, wasn't an AIDS complication. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh really? Then the 10 days' course of antibiotics should've been a breeze -- 
except it wasn't. Didn't stop the cough and fevers and managed to eat my 
stomach raw, like the eagle who came every day to devour Prometheus' liver. No 
problem, though. They switched me over to seven days of Antibiotic 2, a 
veritable prince of a drug. Which left me feeling that I was living on Drano, 
tossing my cookies and racked with cramps and diarrhea. 
</P>
<P>
 And that one didn't work either. So I am 10 days into Antibiotic 3 and finally 
sounding less consumptive but so battered by the eagles that I am something 
like a scarecrow, 25 pounds shed in less than a month. Thus prey to a withering 
lack of perspective and not much inclined to be blowing up balloons and 
festooning the gay pride parade with pompoms and paper streamers. 
</P>
<P>
 No, my bid for inclusion in Stonewall 25 has taken a darker path, as I've 
struggled to put into words some clock-driven reflections about the state of 
gay and lesbian life and my dwindling body. A romantic presumption, admittedly, 
having as its source "The Last Tycoon," F. Scott Fitzgerald's unfinished novel 
-- cut short by a coronary in a house about six blocks from me in the Hollywood 
Hills. Leaving behind a mere scatter of notes as to what would've followed and 
ending with his famous dictum, all in caps: "ACTION IS CHARACTER." 
</P>
<P>
 But of course, that book was published anyway, filled out with notes and 
literary guesswork, especially poignant by the very fact of its incompleteness. 
I was under no illusions that my own maundering-in-progress would qualify for 
the Scott and Zelda treatment, stamped in gold by Scribner's.  
</P>
<P>
 Yet it wasn't just inappropriate self-puffery that proved such a personal goad 
to "work, for the night is coming," as the Protestant hymnal has it. No, it had 
more to do with a whole generation of the incomplete to which AIDS had 
consigned me -- and a legion of my fellow queer novelists from Robert Ferro and 
Bo Huston to Allen Barnett, the last of whom had left a single volume of 
brilliantly harrowing stories, "The Body and Its Dangers and Other Stories." 
</P>
<P>
 All of them snatched mid-sentence, as it were. My beloved friend Vito Russo, a 
triple feature in the flesh, who knew every homo nuance in a hundred years of 
film -- from "Sylvia Scarlett" to Brando's lisp in "Reflections in a Golden 
Eye." Or John Preston, who entered Death's ice shadow even as I started to 
write this, who triumphed over years of being dismissed as a hack pornographer 
to become our primo anthologist. Working under the gun, every one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 Just like I am, two years now with full-blown AIDS. Leashed to three separate 
IV drugs and a small mountain of oral medication. It was suggested to me by 
well-meaning types that I should just keep a diary of AIDS, one man's 
eyewitness report from the front lines. But I felt as if I'd been doing nothing 
but that for years, and I didn't have the stomach for "World War III, Part V." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, others had covered that waterfront all along. From Emmanuel Dreuilhe 
in Paris to George Whitmore in New York, urgent personal witness that stood on 
the shelves with the history of the plague, Randy Shilts' definitive "And the 
Band Played On," and the work of its various analysts, notably Douglas Crimp 
and Susan Sontag, as well as Preston's own compendium, "Personal Dispatches: 
Writers Confront AIDS."  
</P>
<P>
 What I wanted to do instead in this twilight time of mine was look at all the 
vectors of my queer life. People and places and politics that had stuck with 
me, resonant still despite the viral deluge of 12 years of calamity. How did 
the disease change the way I looked at things? Did anything mean the same 
anymore? 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, my rabid contempt for official religions -- the Orwellian 
lies and the thought police -- has only deepened over time. The entropy 
inherent in what is still quaintly called the civilized world increases 
geometrically; utter disintegration looms. For mine is a classic fin de siecle 
gloom, Henry Adams without the education, convinced the world has just about 
had it. Which puts me in bed with the real wackos from Waco, the millennial 
Christian cults and the rapturists. The main difference between me and them 
being that the end of my civilization is as much their fault as the ozone hole 
or the plummet toward universal illiteracy or the opening of the 
hundred-millionth McDonald's. 
</P>
<P>
 My ranting, in other words, is nothing new. What takes me more than slightly 
aback is discovering how certain people and incidents and feelings have only 
grown more precious over time. The stinging eloquence of my fellow Promethean, 
Larry Kramer, who taught me more than anybody not to go down without making 
noise. The undaunted altruism of Elie Wiesel and his hammering cry, "Remember"; 
of Audrey Hepburn's work for UNICEF at the bottom of the world. (For my heroes 
aren't all gay; not plaster saints, but the real thing.) Or the '88 march on 
Washington, when we occupied the Food and Drug Administration like so many 
urban guerrillas, and the vast '93 march that followed. A whole people massed 
for freedom, in all our ringing diversity. 
</P>
<P>
 Things that have mattered more and changed me more than I've ever quite 
acknowledged. Sources of affirmation and hope that reflect, as in a mirror, the 
self I want to be. Project 10, Virginia Uribe's program for gay and lesbian 
teens at Fairfax High. The national outpouring of support from PFLAG, Parents 
and Friends of Lesbians and Gays. Justice Harry Blackmun's soul-stirring 
dissent in the 1986 Georgia sodomy case, Bowers vs. Hardwick, in which he 
establishes once and for all that every American is equal. 
</P>
<P>
 NOTHING STANDS STILL. I WOULD HAVE TO ISSUE A DAILY bulletin to keep up with 
the burgeoning scandal of the pedophile priests, even as the anti-gay Pope has 
tried to shift the blame to the anarchy of permissiveness. Society's to blame. 
Or, as one of the church apologists has observed, we end up with the priests we 
deserve. It's our own damned fault. How's that for spin control? Mark Twain 
would've loved the gobbledygook in all of this: Call it the spiritual 
equivalent of the Twinkie defense. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortuitously, by way of counterforce, there have been certain heartening 
developments. An Episcopal bishop from Boston who came for tea last winter 
surprised himself, I think, when he gave serious thought to my lover Winston's 
challenge that he come out to the full House of Bishops. Advice he ended up 
taking, in his own way, of course, sending an epistle to his colleagues just 
before the general meeting. In part, the bishop wrote, "I have promised myself 
that I will not remain silent, invisible, unknown. After all is said and done, 
the choice for me is not whether or not I am a gay man, but whether or not I am 
honest about who I am with myself and others. It is a choice to take down the 
wall of silence I have built around an important and vital part of my life, to 
end the separation and isolation I have imposed on myself all these years."  
</P>
<P>
 Action is character , in other words. Thus did Otis Charles become the first 
bishop of any mainline denomination to disclose publicly the truth of his 
sexual orientation. An important milestone in gay and lesbian history, and a 
ringing rebuke to the status quo of invisibility. The reception to his coming 
out can be imagined. At a recent House of Bishops meeting in Panama, several 
bishops embraced him for his fierce integrity while others averted their faces 
in shame.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps his coming out doesn't seem like much in a culture that's foaming with 
the pus of hate, where everybody's intolerant of everybody else, where 
so-called men of God crucify all who are different. Where Bill Clinton, this 
Wal-Mart Lothario, this Bill-who-will-say-anything-to-anyone, sold my people 
down the river. Offering us up as a bargaining chip to that whining homophobe, 
Sam Nunn. Our President, we were given to understand, yet he doesn't miss a 
beat fawning after the religious right. 
</P>
<P>
 In a cozy chat with The People in the Rose Garden, a troubled preacher 
expressed concern to Clinton about the military debate on fags; the mere idea 
of queers in uniform went against his values. And the Big Mac President allowed 
as how, no matter what the policy turned out to be, it mustn't be perceived as 
"condoning a lifestyle." "Lifestyle": the Christian Reich's equivalent of 
calling us kikes and niggers.  
</P>
<P>
 Then, after his vacation in August, the President graced us with a report on 
his summer reading, in which he earnestly worried that there was too much 
backlash against the religious view of life. Of the constitutional separation 
of church and state, he wistfully hoped there was room for a door in the wall. 
Thus the pious could bring a little hope and moral certainty to the bloody mess 
of politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there isn't room in my constitution, not for so much as a rat hole in 
that wall. And Sunday-school Bill, who sped to Denver to meet the hate-filled 
Pope -- Denver, symbol of all our lost ground as gay and lesbian citizens -- 
turns out to be just another hypocrite Baptist yahoo. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for all of that, the state of the gay and lesbian union is stronger 
than ever. There are Metropolitan Community churches in cities all over the 
country where God is no longer a bigot. The Vatican does everything it can to 
shun the members of Dignity, the gay and lesbian Catholic group, barring them 
from church premises and the sacraments, and yet the numbers of the gay and 
lesbian faithful continue to grow and grow. The gay men's choruses sing us our 
anthems. The lesbian sexual-and-substance-abuse recovery movement makes its 
presence felt from Maine to Hawaii, its members surviving the suicidal 
loneliness of being shunned by "decent" people. 
</P>
<P>
 And "family values"? Please, we've got them in spades. In the past two 
decades, we have forged a force whose dedication to multiculturalism is 
paramount. Adoptions by gay and lesbian parents continue to soar despite the 
din of intolerance. Winston and I are proud to know sisters who've conceived in 
vitro and by turkey baster, and they are the advance guard of a whole new 
morning, a whole new definition of family.  
</P>
<P>
 We have our own version of family values up here on King's Road. Winston and I 
and Puck and Buddy, a boxer and a Labrador-ridgeback. Two unfixed males who 
were at each other's throats at first, unused to sharing territory, and now 
they sleep flank to flank and otherwise run each other ragged with play. We 
call ourselves "the four dogs" and keep our precarious balance, making what 
stand we can against the inexorable predations of the virus. Winston has buried 
one lover, and I have buried two. Grotesque beyond all measure, of course, but 
proof that the capacity for love is stronger even than grief.  
</P>
<P>
 But don't be fooled by so much domestic tranquillity. My rage at my lost 
country is undiminished. Yet I choose my shouting matches carefully these days, 
husbanding my energy and adrenaline for the war going on inside me. Meanwhile, 
the dying continues unabated. Michael Callen, our troubadour chanteur , stolen 
only months ago, mid-song as it were. And in a recent New York Times, an obit 
for my friend Dan Bailey, one of the founding fathers of New York's Gay Men's 
Health Crisis, sainted teacher of the disabled, the gentlest man imaginable. 
And there is no one I can call for details because all of our mutual 
acquaintances are dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Or as Victor, my last best friend, is wont to observe: "They don't understand. 
I don't just want a cure. I want a cure and all my friends back." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed. And what are two more lost from the magic circle of life after 
Stonewall? Think of it as two more rocks flung at the vast glass house of the 
world's complacency, falling short as usual. But then the numbers of the 
disappeared are relative at best, buried in a thicket of lies they call 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, as the poet Randall Jarrell put it succinctly, counting the bodies of 
another war: 
</P>
<P>
 We died on the wrong page of the almanac. . . . When we died, they said, "Our 
casualties were low."  
</P>
<P>
 AS FOR MY OWN LOSSES, THE PILE OF BODIES IS HARDLY COUNTABLE ANYMORE except in 
the heart -- because the dead outnumber the living now. Personally, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 And personal is my watchword now for whatever I can manage to leave behind, 
even if it's only fragments and a couple of lines in banner caps. Just after 
the march on Washington, a year ago now, I had a call from Tina Brown, esteemed 
editor of the New Yorker, asking if I would write a piece on the week's events. 
I told her it was the very thing I was planning to do next but demurred because 
I was probably looking at 50 pages and two months' work. Not news enough by 
then -- not hot enough -- for her purposes, I imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 She quickly countered that time and length were not a problem. I should send 
it along once it was finished to my satisfaction. She assured me she was a 
great admirer of my work. 
</P>
<P>
 Flush from so much flattery, I nevertheless replied with a poke of irony. 
Maybe she hadn't heard, I told her, but her staff had already rejected two of 
my twilight essays. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who did that?" she retorted, a trifle defensive, clearly having been left out 
of the loop. "And why?" 
</P>
<P>
 "They said my work was too personal." Oh, she didn't like that at all, but 
then I hadn't the least idea who the under-editors were who'd sent the material 
back to my agent. "It's all right, really," I assured her. "You have to 
understand that I spent 20 years being turned down because my work was 
considered 'too gay.' Which I came to regard as a compliment and proof I was on 
the right track." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, due to the geometric growth of the literature of my people -- the honors 
showered on Dorothy Allison and the "crossover" success of Rita Mae Brown -- I 
had presumably outlived any lingering curse at being so dismissed. Except now 
I'd become "too personal," which I couldn't help but feel was even better than 
a compliment. For I grew up in a culture in which the personal was verboten , 
especially in polite company -- a company in which I've long since sold my 
stock. In the end, I didn't send the piece to Ms. Brown. So what felt like a 
potential rejection slip was as much a cause for celebration.  
</P>
<P>
 But in fact the real dismissal has come from much closer to home. It's 
probably no surprise, but the gay and lesbian nation has lately spun off a 
particularly nasty subspecies of Neo-Con dissent. A sourpuss brand of critic 
who rejects the very notion of "gay." Their homosexuality, they say, is the 
least of their defining characteristics, rather like having brown eyes instead 
of blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus they disdain gay pride and its carnival exuberance and find our activist 
politics rude and out of bounds, especially the unseemly spread of the gay 
"subculture." For God's sake, they shrill, can't we be more discreet? No wonder 
so many decent people hate us. 
</P>
<P>
 These are the views of conservative men, who are the first to admit they 
cannot speak for lesbians, since they don't know any. Of course they imply that 
AIDS is all our own subcultural fault, just deserts for our libertine ways. But 
which of us is the stereotype here? These meek and proper clerks and choirboys, 
assimilationist at all costs? "Don't ask, don't tell" so deeply ingrained, they 
can sport it as a tattoo when the camps are ready. 
</P>
<P>
 These men have no sense whatsoever of the legacy of Stonewall -- of the 
multifaceted community we have forged like pioneers or the systems we have put 
in place to care for our own, or the common vow we have made to stop the 
silence. They're welcome to their free speech, of course, and welcome to rub 
shoulders with the pundits and think-tankers of the right, as well as the 
church supper crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 Time alone will tell whether resistance or collaboration is more in our best 
interests as a people. For the present, by all means let them be not gay, not 
gender-variant, not ghettoized, with nary a sequin to betray them. Shunning all 
parades and commemorations of struggle. Prim and smug and Puritan by choice, 
far removed from any culture that smacks of sub. 
</P>
<P>
 But I give them fair warning that I, for one, am taking it all personally -- 
too personally, in fact. Sitting out the silver anniversary fireworks though I 
am, tied to the blood and bone of this alien ground of my body, but standing 
sentry anyway at the borders of our dream of freedom. And keeping a file of 
mealiness, of pandering to creeps, of all accommodation with the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, let the Stonewall celebrants save me a piece of cake from the 
party, a rainbow flag and a rousing chorus of "We shall overcome." Understand 
that I am far too busy tracking the enemy within. But I'm with you, brother and 
sister, and will be always, even after I'm carried from the battle and planted 
on the final hill. You must never forget: There's no turning us back now. No 
more closets and no more loveless years in solitary. From now on, we have each 
other. Freedom is on our side. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is no America without us.

By Mariana Cook's photographs are in the collections of the Metropolitan Museum 
of Art in New York and the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. She 
lives in New York City. This portfolio is excerpted from Fathers and Daughters: 
In Their Own Words, recently published by Chronicle Books in San Francisco.

 Portrait maker Mariana Cook began focusing on fathers and daughters in 1990 as 
a means of exploring what she calls the "mysterious bond" between genders and 
generations. Four years later, that exploration has produced a book of 60 
portraits of the famous and the unknown, captioned in some cases by the 
subjects and so revealing that writer William Styron, the father of three 
daughters and a subject of Cook, calls them "a substantial miracle of 
photography." In his introduction to the pictures, Styron writes: "That all of 
these images and arrangements are not entirely harmonious, nor without 
emotional tension, adds to their appeal, and to their honesty. What matters is 
the poetic grace with which the artist has arrested for a moment the humor, the 
tenderness and, most often, the love that underlie one of the best of all human 
connections."

 Who are these little people who sit on my lap? Strange creatures that we have 
made, who live in the world that Dominique and I have cobbled together and in a 
world that they are making up for themselves. . . . It seems at one and the 
same time that we have never lived without these two and that it was just 
yesterday that, childless, I prepared myself for fatherhood by thinking about 
Dada. Something I would soon experience and be helpless to prevent: total 
chaos. . . . Chaos is turning into harmonic anarchy as we all bumble along into 
the future, bouncing off each other, weathering our teacup tempests and days of 
bliss alike.

 A lot of people assume it is wonderful to have a famous justice for a father. 
"Wow, it must be so exciting." "Oh, you must be so proud." 
</P>
<P>
 It is exciting, and I am proud, but there are costs. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 About two years after I was married, and after Dad wrote Roe v. Wade, he was 
scheduled to come to Boston to give the keynote address for the annual meeting 
of the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology. He had never seen my 
house. I was in the early months of my first pregnancy, working full time, 
feeling exhausted and seasick. It was spring, and the buildup of pressure at 
the court to finish the year's cases had begun, but I might have been able to 
invite him and Mother to drive the hour and a half roundtrip to where I lived 
if Mother hadn't said, "Don't ask anything of him, Nancy. He's terribly tired." 
So I made the trip to Boston three times in 24 hours, taking most of a day off 
from work to be able to hear him speak. When my baby was born, he didn't come 
to see me. I took the baby to Washington to see him. 
</P>
<P>
 At such times it has been hard to sort out what is important. On this occasion 
it was a question of obstetrics in the abstract or in the concrete. Do I take 
care of the author of Roe v. Wade, and by extension all those women who don't 
want to be pregnant and the obstetricians and gynecologists who provide their 
medical care, or does he take care of the woman who is his pregnant daughter 
and the baby who is his grandchild? This kind of thing has been confusing. What 
am I supposed to do with my anger, despair and frustration? 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, his are the most comforting hands to hold: square and warm and 
responsive. I like it that my own hands, not especially beautiful for a 
woman's, look like his. At the onset of adolescence in eighth grade, a 
difficult year for most new teen-agers, he smoothed my path by reading me 
Sherlock Holmes and helping me prepare for, of all things, home economics 
quizzes. We got an A, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 We talk on the phone a lot, in a way that is best captured by the nearly 
untranslatable German word gemutlich. Gemutlich zusammen -- warm and 
comfortable together. He has called more as he has gotten older, little 
conversations scattered through the week. I have learned how to make him laugh, 
and then he will end the call by saying, "Oh, I feel so much better now," and 
indeed, I can hear it in his voice. I hate letting go of him to hang up, 
dreading that point in the future where there will be no more calls.

 Her questions are coming from the end of the ages. Her silences are the slow 
heritage of uncertain millenniums. Her words are whispered as if she knew for a 
very short time all that -- too soon -- life will make her forget. Her answers, 
coming from the distant future, help me to understand what I desperately try to 
grasp from a flying past.

 Natasha was a bouncy, cheerful child full of fun and imagination. A father's 
great illusion is that his daughter will always remain so; a source of infinite 
tenderness and unexpected surprises. The surprises do follow, but they are not 
always tender or funny. A person cannot enter and leave your living room 
forever doing cartwheels. First Communion is not an eternal event. Photographs 
fade, gauze gets torn, silk yellows. 
</P>
<P>
 I always laugh remembering that Natasha gave me a first intimation of 
mortality. She was four and skipped with another child through my study, where 
I was watching television. "Melanie," she said, "this is my father. He is a 
hundred years old." In this photograph we are both aging, in different ways, at 
different paces. 
</P>
<P>
 I am both far and near to her in this photo; so is she from herself. She is 
seen at a final, painful moment of adolescence, no longer confident, no longer 
at ease with herself or with me. She called it her "young grim winter," finding 
ways to invent and reinvent herself over and over again, to please, to shock. 
Loud and silly sometimes, smooth and cool at others, surprising her teachers, 
correcting them, having read through the complete works of Artaud at age 14, 
about to become the child in the New Yorker cartoon whose teacher, gun in hand, 
starkly states: "You know too much." 
</P>
<P>
 In this photo, she is about to go from being in the open or being in 
seclusion, to being with others. . . . She does not cling to me, I cling to 
her.

 Cora has always seemed to be completely in command of herself. This comes 
across in numerous small ways: her resolute choice of clothing each morning, 
her systematic preference for the company of other girls. I admire, perhaps 
even envy, the way she has cultivated an unusual degree of autonomy as well as 
the amazing equilibrium that goes along with it. I think these qualities are 
unusual in someone her age. They make her rare moments of dependency on me all 
the more precious.

STREET FIGHTING MAN; HEAVYWEIGHT JEREMY WILLIAMS HAS TAKEN SOME HARD SHOTS 
INSIDE THE RING AND OUT ON THE STREETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SEAN WATERS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeremy Williams' life in the boxing ring is not much different from his life 
on the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had my head busted open in a street fight," Williams said. "I've had my 
teeth chipped, eyes bloodied, my back cut with a knife. I've been jumped just 
because I had been in the wrong neighborhood or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams began boxing professionally in 1992. In reality, he started 
practicing his trade much earlier on the mean streets of Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember when I was 12 years old, I looked out the window and I would see 
some guy shooting heroin," he said. "I think that, and waking up on Christmas 
and not having any presents, that's where my anger comes from." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams is only 21, but he has the savvy of a veteran when he steps into the 
ring. On Friday night at the Olympic Auditorium, he is scheduled to meet 
"Smokin' " Bert Cooper in a 10-round heavyweight bout. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing a 12-round decision to Larry Donald on March 12 in Las Vegas, 
Williams' career has taken on a sense of urgency. It was Williams' first loss 
in 16 pro fights and it cost him the World Boxing Council Continental Americas 
title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've learned to take my career seriously," Williams said. "I took it 
seriously, but I didn't take it a step further. In some ways, losing to Donald 
was a good thing because it showed me how important it is to take things one at 
a time and to take every fight seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 After the loss, Williams left manager Bill Cayton, who guided Mike Tyson early 
in his career. He also changed trainers, opting for Joe Goossen over his 
father, Charles Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Goossen began working with Williams before a May bout against Andrew Stokes at 
the Olympic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really thought he was just a head-down winning brawler," Goossen said. 
"Jeremy gets in there and bangs with anybody. Unfortunately, that's not always 
the right thing to do. But what I found out is that he is a legitimate 
athlete." 
</P>
<P>
 So did Stokes. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams knocked out the journeyman in 39 seconds of the first round. After 
breaking a clinch, Williams threw a short right hook to the head that sent 
Stokes reeling to the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to show all that Donald stuff wasn't me," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams (16-1, 13 knockouts) is now training in Big Bear with World Boxing 
Organization lightweight champion Oscar de la Hoya, junior-lightweight Gabriel 
Ruelas, International Boxing Federation lightweight champion Rafael Ruelas and 
former heavyweight champion Riddick Bowe. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is unbelievably hard to hit, very fast hands," Goossen said. "I've been 
working on shortening up his punches, putting more combinations together and 
using his legs a little bit more. . . . He's been kind of a surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams came within a victory of making the 1992 U.S. Olympic boxing team but 
lost to Montel Griffin in a light-heavyweight bout. Williams had beaten Griffin 
in the Olympic trials, but lost two decisions at the team box-offs.  
</P>
<P>
 Williams was so upset about failing to make the team that he knocked over a 
table with a lectern and microphones during the post-fight news conference. He 
then went into a minute-long tirade against the tournament organizers. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned to Long Beach, trouble was around the corner. Fellow boxer 
Tyrone White was shot to death in September, 1992, after a fight at a hamburger 
stand. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some guy started talking beef, and he came over to me, since I was the 
biggest," he said. "I hit him and he fell and then I jumped on his friend, who 
was much bigger than we were. And the guy that I first hit pulled out a gun and 
aimed at me and shot Tyrone. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tyrone fell. When I looked up, the guy was plugging him with like four more 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Williams attributes much of his troubles to involvement with gangs. His older 
brothers Eric and Jason were gang members, and Jeremy followed their lead. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not gonna tell you what's right or what's wrong," he said. "I'm gonna 
tell you from my example. My two older brothers have been in prison all their 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 "Watching my brothers, I said, 'OK, well maybe they just didn't do it right,' 
" he said. "So when I did it, I got stabbed, I got shot at. I was in a car 
going off to a club and the guy next to me got shot in the back, through the 
car door. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's what you want to do with your life, hell, go do it. But what I'm 
saying is that you will be a knucklehead like me." 
</P>
<P>
 After the death of White, Williams signed a four-year contract with Cayton and 
began training with Kevin Rooney in Catskills, N.Y. Williams was heralded as 
the next Tyson and won his first 13 professional bouts, including the WBC 
Continental Americas belt.  
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-2, 210-pound Williams grew tired of the comparisons to Tyson and 
left Rooney to return to Long Beach, where he worked out with his father. 
</P>
<P>
 After losing to Donald, Williams decided to leave Cayton and is trying to get 
a release from his contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams, who also is a model and actor, said his days of getting in trouble 
are in the past and that he has become more responsible since the birth of his 
sons -- 16-month-old Tyler and 8-month-old Iman. Three years ago, Williams 
became a Muslim and changed his name to Abdul Malik, although he still fights 
under his birth name. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan for Williams is to fight four bouts at the Olympic before returning 
to center stage in Las Vegas. He wants to fight for a heavyweight title but 
said he isn't ready to take on Tyson if the former champion is released from 
jail. 
</P>
<P>
 "What for? Tyson's gonna break somebody's neck and it ain't gonna be mine," 
Williams said.

MOVIES; THE GOOD, BAD AND NOT-SO UGLY; PAST AFI FESTIVALS EMPHASIZED QUANTITY 
TO SHOWCASE FILMMAKERS. THIS YEAR, WILL FEWER FILMS MEAN HIGHER ARTISTIC 
QUALITY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The AFI Film Festival, which runs Thursday to July 7 at the Monica 4-Plex in 
Santa Monica, is about half the size as previous years -- and that may well 
make it twice as good. In the past the festival, like its predecessor Filmex, 
has tended to blur the line between quality and quantity to give a showcase to 
as many filmmakers as possible. That's an arguably noble sentiment, but the 
plain truth is that too many bad movies bring down the overall artistic level 
of any film festival. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll be showing about 70-75 feature films, and we'll have eight or nine 
special programs," said the festival's director, Ken Wlaschin, in an interview 
at AFI headquarters in Hollywood. "This means that we'll be able to have more 
repeat screenings so that people will have a greater opportunity to see the 
best films. We've decided that it's very, very hard for the Los Angeles 
audience to cope with so many films, so we feel a smaller festival will 
actually make people more aware of what we're showing. This has been primarily 
a philosophic decision, but it also helps economically -- not having to bring 
in so many filmmakers, for one thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The festival's greatest vulnerability in the past has always been in its large 
offering of American independent films, many of which were so mediocre -- or 
worse -- that they never even had a prayer of finding distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've raised the level of the bar over which the films must jump," Wlaschin 
said. Judging from the films already previewed, this seems to be the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet streamlining does not mean that there won't be something for everyone. The 
festival opens with the premiere of one of the summer's major releases, "Wyatt 
Earp," starring Kevin Costner, and closes with the American premiere of German 
producer Regina Ziegler's "Erotic Tales Series," six 30-minute vignettes made 
by Bob Rafelson, Susan Seidelman, Melvin Van Peebles, Ken Russell, Paul Cox and 
Indian director Mani Kaul. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be special tributes to actors Holly Hunter and Dennis Hopper, 
directors Henry Jaglom and Paul Verhoeven and television producer Frank von 
Zerneck. There will be a retrospective of the films of Andy Warhol protege Paul 
Morrissey; a repeat screening of Krzysztof Kieslowski's landmark 10-part, 
nearly 11-hour "The Decalogue," an investigation into the relevance of the Ten 
Commandments in modern life, and director Sergei Bondarchuk's cut of his 1967 
"War and Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cine Latino: A Tribute to the OAS/Americas Film Festival" will present in 
person Mexico's Arturo Ripstein, Argentina's Eliseo Subiela and Brazil's Nelson 
Periera dos Santos. There will be screenings of Ripstein's "The Beginning of 
the End," a monumental family saga based on a novel by 1988 Nobel Prize winner 
Naguib Mahfouz; Subiela's highly praised "The Dark Side of the Heart," a 
parable about one man's struggle against the forces of conformity from the 
maker of the extraordinary and distinctive "Man Facing Southeast," and Periera 
dos Santos' "The Third Bank of the River," composed of five separate tales, and 
a 30th-anniversary screening of his "Vidas Secas," a story of a family's 
pilgrimage through Brazil's rugged northeastern back-lands in search of a 
better life. 
</P>
<P>
 The UCLA Film Archive will join forces with the American Film Institute in 
presenting on July 2 an all-night "Comedies of Elegance," in tribute to the 
AFI's film catalogue for the 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call Theatix, (213) 466-1767. Selected Picks 
</P>
<P>
 "Black Harvest" (Friday, 1:30 and 6:30 p.m.). Danish director Anders Refn, 
whose similar 1978 first feature "The Baron" was shown at Filmex, once again 
takes us into the world of turn-of-the-century landed gentry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Black Harvest," period perfect and exquisitely crafted, charts the decline 
and fall of an aristocratic family that is triggered by the wretched excesses 
of a cruel, tyrannical patriarch (Ole Ernst), a hard-drinking, womanizing 
reckless gambler with an ineffectual wife and four daughters, only one of whom 
(Sofie Graaboel) has enough gumption even to consider defying him. Just as 
"Black Harvest" threatens to go over the top in lurid excesses and unrelenting 
misery, it pulls together for a powerful finish at once quietly ironic and 
tragic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Johnny 100 Pesos" (Friday, 4:10 and 9:20 p.m.). Drawing on an actual 1990 
incident, Chilean filmmaker Gustavo Graef Marino brings a tart, timely 
political dimension to this classic hostage standoff suspenser, alternating 
effortlessly between the comic and the tragic. Armando Araiza has the title 
role as a handsome but woefully naive 17-year-old student (and part-time petty 
thief) who throws in his lot with a group of veteran criminals to hold up an 
illegal currency exchange in a downtown Santiago high rise. The entire job is 
bungled from the get-go, with the bad guys taking five hostages. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does Marino sustain the resulting stalemate with unflagging zest and 
imagination and take aim at familiar media excesses, but he also brings in the 
chaotic secretary of the interior's office, which in democracy's infancy has a 
vested interest in getting control of the situation so as to protect Chile's 
newly refurbished image both at home and abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "Total Balalaika Show" (Saturday, 1:20 p.m.; repeats next Sunday, 1:20 p.m.). 
Not surprisingly, Finland's sly, whimsical Aki Kaurismaki had a hand in 
bringing together the Leningrad Cowboys -- a goofy but endearing Finnish rock 
band favoring pointy shoes with matching pointy hair, unicorn style -- and the 
thundering, sober, richly uniformed Alexandrov Red Army Chorus and Dance 
Ensemble for a concert held last year in Helsinki's Senate Square that 
attracted a crowd of 70,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The result provided a perfect concert film for Kaurismaki -- a sweet, 
alternately hilarious and poignant cross-cultural experience, and no small 
landmark in detente. It's also a nifty follow-up to Kaurismaki's "Leningrad 
Cowboys Go America." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Wedding Gift" (Saturday, 6:30 p.m.; repeats July 1, 1:30 p.m.). One of 
the festival's most widely appealing films, this British production, directed 
deftly by Richard Loncraine, is an exceptionally touching and mature love story 
starring Julie Walters as a witty middle-aged housewife, struck down by a 
mysterious debilitating disease, and Jim Broadbent as her almost overly devoted 
husband. 
</P>
<P>
 They are two people who have long put each other first but are now confronted 
with challenges that threaten to overwhelm them. Walters and Broadbent are 
immensely skillful, with the result that the film, based on a true incident, is 
genuinely poignant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of Sight" (Saturday, 7 p.m.). David Sutherland's engaging, in-depth 
documentary in which for once we're able to see a woman's blindness as but one 
aspect of her overall life and personality. Feisty Diane Starin wonders whether 
"America is ready for a blind girl who isn't a goody-two-shoes." 
</P>
<P>
 Stubbornly independent, self-assertive and promiscuous, the 34-year-old Starin 
is a Northern California horse rancher caught up in a tempestuous relationship 
with a weathered, macho Marlboro Man type old enough to be her father. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love After Love" (June 28, 1:20 and 6:40 p.m.). Diane Kurys' wise, elegant 
film is a consideration of how difficult it is for a couple, even sophisticated 
Parisians, to sustain a longstanding, open relationship into the competitive, 
disillusioned '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Love After Love" unfolds in the year between the 35th and 36th birthdays of 
its heroine, a successful novelist (Isabelle Huppert, at her most beautiful and 
poised) who for 20 years has lived with an equally successful architect 
(Bernard Giraudeau). 
</P>
<P>
 "Exile" (June 29, 3:50 and 9 p.m.). A beautifully articulated romantic fable 
from Australia's Paul Cox about a young man (Aden Young) who, in the mid-19th 
Century, is punished for stealing some sheep by being banished to an 
uninhabited island, where in time his fate attracts a young woman (Beth 
Champion) with whom he creates an idyllic existence. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox effectively suggests how out of touch with nature society is in general 
and religion in particular, but he mars his notable effort by recurrent 
appearances of the ghost of a priest (Norman Kaye), uttering predictably sage 
and totally redundant remarks; you wish that the priest could be edited out of 
the film entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the East" ("D'Est") (June 29, 4 and 9:10 p.m.). Demanding but luminously 
beautiful film from Belgium's ever-venturesome Chantal Akerman, who literally 
-- and slowly -- pans her camera all the way from East Germany to Moscow in an 
attempt to record public life (with several glimpses of private lives 
interspersed) before change inevitably occurs. Her journey spans summer to 
winter, ending in a long survey of Moscow, where most citizens seem frozen in 
endless queues. 
</P>
<P>
 As always, Akerman's sense of composition, camera placement and movement is 
eloquent. "D'Est" quietly celebrates the continuity of life beyond political 
systems. 
</P>
<P>
 "Helas Pour Moi" ("Oh, Woe Is Me") (June 29, 8 p.m., Academy of Motion Picture 
Arts and Sciences). Gerard Depardieu stars as a businessman whose body is 
briefly inhabited by God, which is but a point of departure for Jean-Luc 
Godard's beautiful but complex contemplation of our longing for spiritual 
redemption. (It is quite possible to conclude, disturbingly, that Depardieu's 
experience is ultimately of no consequence.) 
</P>
<P>
 Chock-full of Godard's trademark plethora of quotations, chapter headings and 
aphorisms, it is as difficult as it is beguiling, a testament to one of the 
great filmmakers of our time's continuing capacity for growth and 
experimentation, and his ability to elicit an array of emotional and 
intellectual responses from the most elliptical means. 
</P>
<P>
 "Women From the Lake of Scented Souls" (July 2, 4:10 p.m.). Xie Fei's stunning 
feminist work stars Wu Yujuan, whose sturdy heroine, although unglamorous, 
brings to mind Joan Crawford in "Mildred Pierce." In rural Northern China the 
quality of her sesame oil is so fine that she attracts Japanese investors. 
While successfully running her mill she is, however, burdened with a drunken, 
oafish husband (to whom she was sold at 7, married at 13) and above all with 
trying to marry off her sexually frustrated, mentally retarded son. 
</P>
<P>
 The point that Xie makes with the impact of revelation -- and not an ounce of 
preachiness -- is how oppressed women can be tempted into helping oppress yet 
another generation of women. 
</P>
<P>
 "Handgun" (July 5, 4:10 and 9:20 p.m.). Whitney Ransick's smart, funny debut 
feature is an endlessly inventive heist picture in which everything that 
possibly could go wrong does. Treat Williams, an ex-con, and Paul Schulze, who 
sells fake burial plots, are brothers eager to get their hands on the 
half-million their father (Seymour Cassel) has just stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 More credible and less violent than the more radical "Reservoir Dogs," to 
which this film will inevitably be compared.

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: THE WEIGHT GAME; LOSE 43 
POUNDS. RIDE A HORSE. EMOTE. JUST ANOTHER DAY AT THE OK CORRAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For many of us, the gaining and losing of even 5 pounds is viewed as sensual 
penance, a long, torturous process replete with calorie counting and mood 
swings. For some actors, it's just part of the job description. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert De Niro was required to shovel his way to spare-tire city as boxer Jake 
LaMotta in "Raging Bull." Gary Oldman shed enough weight from his already lean 
frame to cultivate Sid Vicious' skeletal junkie physique in "Sid and Nancy." 
Now Dennis Quaid convincingly knocks on heaven's door as the tubercular Doc 
Holliday in "Wyatt Earp." 
</P>
<P>
 For the role, Quaid dropped 43 pounds from his 6-foot-1, 180-pound frame in 
only three months and was still able to ride a horse, gunsling and emote every 
day in the grueling New Mexico heat. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaid may look awful in the film, but he lost the weight healthfully and 
retained optimal energy, stresses Quaid's nutritionist Carrie Wiatt, of the 
Santa Monica-based Diet Designs, who guided him through the process, along with 
a physician who kept on-the-set tabs on Quaid's health and state of mind. The 
regimen consisted of a 1,200-calorie-a-day no-fat diet, daily aerobic exercise 
and lots of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing and the intervals are important. The metabolism burns faster when 
you eat small amounts several times a day," Wiatt says. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaid's meals were prepared and delivered by Diet Designs to location. The 
actor was not deprived, Wiatt says. He was allowed "free" vegetables all day 
and often cooked a fat-free vegetable soup that he was allowed to swig with 
abandon. He was also allowed fat-free baked products (bagels, muffins) and one 
ounce of fat-free taco chips, with two tablespoons of bean dip and salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaid's favorite meal was a pasta Bolognese dinner made with breast of turkey. 
Without exercise, however, Quaid's body would have gone into semi-starvation 
mode, storing fat and lowering his metabolism. To keep him mentally sharp and 
ensure that he lost weight and retained muscle, Quaid ran six to nine miles a 
day, and occasionally walked a stair climber. That alone burned off 500 to 600 
calories. 
</P>
<P>
 A vitamin regimen was also important. Quaid took mineral-enhanced 
multivitamins. B-complex in particular helped combat stress and fatigue.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dennis is extremely structured and diligent," Wiatt says. "This was not a fad 
diet. It was done with real food." 
</P>
<P>
 After the shoot Quaid put back the weight in about a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was hungry," Wiatt says, trafficking in understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 Gaining weight, however, can be just as hard as losing, she contends. Again, 
the rebuilding process was done through careful meal and exercise planning. 
Gradual calorie and protein increases were stressed to prevent bloating and 
nausea -- from 1,600 calories a day up to the normal 2,400 for men. Because 
Quaid's metabolism is naturally fast, he raised that to 2,800 calories. He 
gained it back in muscle, switching from aerobics to weight training. He worked 
in his home gym with a trainer using low weights and lots of repetitions to 
build tone and flexibility, rather than mass.  
</P>
<P>
 "Dennis is now in the best shape he's ever been in," Wiatt says.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe. But when asked to comment on the process, Quaid had only one thing to 
say: "I wasn't a lot of fun to live with. I was Mr. Mood Swings."

FILM CLIPS / A LOOK INSIDE HOLLYWOOD AND THE MOVIES: OFF-CENTERPIECE; BLAME IT 
ON BIZET; THE LINKING OF SEX AND THE DANGER OF CIGARETTES HAS BEEN AROUND SINCE 
'CARMEN.' NOW SMOKING FINDS NEW MEANING AS A BADGE OF HUMANITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIANN GAREY, Juliann Garey is a senior writer for US magazine. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It hasn't been this easy to get a light in years. In March at the Grammys, 
U2's Bono sauntered onstage with a slim brown cigarillo seesawing up and down 
in the corner of his mouth. Before, during and after her notorious "Letterman" 
appearance, Madonna sucked away on a big fat stogie. In "Reality Bites," Winona 
Ryder and Ethan Hawke subsisted on a steady diet of tobacco supplemented only 
by the occasional Big Gulp. 
</P>
<P>
 In this summer's "The Client," Susan Sarandon shares a tender moment and a 
cigarette with an 11-year-old boy. And just try to find a party-page picture of 
model Kate Moss where she's not hiding behind a cigarette only slightly 
narrower than she is. 
</P>
<P>
 If you want to read more about it, stop into any bookstore and pick up a copy 
of Christopher Buckley's satire of the tobacco industry, "Thank You for 
Smoking," or Richard Klein's eloquent analysis of the literary, philosophical 
and cultural history of smoking, "Cigarettes Are Sublime." 
</P>
<P>
 At a time when Congress and anti-smoking groups are uniting to try to banish 
them from the American scene, cigarettes seem more a part of our culture than 
ever. And in the last two years -- since Bill Clinton entered the White House, 
since the term Generation X became shorthand for "What's wrong with you kids 
today?," since the waif became a fashion trend instead of a charity case -- the 
act of smoking has taken on a whole new significance. 
</P>
<P>
 Cigarettes haven't changed; we have, and as a result, we're sending a 
different message by smoking them. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that we don't know tobacco is bad for us. Every man, woman and child 
in America -- except, of course, the CEOs of the major cigarette manufacturers 
-- knows that. But these days the fact that cigarettes can kill you only seems 
to increase their appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Wielded with an aggressive fatalism by high-profile puffers from Denis Leary 
and Jack Nicholson to just about everyone the media has knighted "Young 
Hollywood," cigarettes send thick and lingering messages: part challenge, part 
existentialist credo (what better way to say carpe diem , dammit?), part 
symptom. 
</P>
<P>
 The allure -- the sex mixed with the death and danger of cigarettes -- has 
wafted through entertainment since Bizet's "Carmen," about a tragic love affair 
between a soldier and his cigarette-rolling girlfriend, became a hit in 1875. 
The cigarette-factory girls in "Carmen" made an early connection between 
smoking and sex: "The sweet talk of lovers -- that is smoke. Their transports 
and their vows -- all that is smoke." And it took off from there. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, cigarettes placed strategically, in the right hands, look 
really good and give focus to a scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love it as a prop," says photographer Helmut Newton. "I think it's very 
sexy, and it gives the person something to do. When you look at movies between 
the wars, people never stopped smoking or drinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Just look at "Casablanca," a film in which the bewitching haze of smoke never 
clears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Take Bogart," says MTV talk-show host and smoker Jon Stewart. "Not an 
attractive guy. So what was it that drew the Ingrid Bermans and the Lauren 
Bacalls? Obviously it was accessorizing with a cigarette. Without the 
cigarette, he's Peter Lorre."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For years, the cigarettes-as-sex metaphor was the main message Hollywood was 
sending when it smoked. It started out simply and, like sex, has gotten 
increasingly more complicated, evolving from movies like "To Have and Have Not" 
and "Now, Voyager" -- in which showing two people smoking was as close as a 
director could get to showing them having sex -- to '80s erotic thrillers like 
"Fatal Attraction" and "Basic Instinct," in which smoking was tantamount to 
S&M. 
</P>
<P>
 In more recent AIDS-aware movies like "Reality Bites," there is a tacit if 
grim acknowledgment that both sex and smoking are deadly, but, hey something's 
gonna kill you -- probably sooner rather than later -- and there aren't any 
good jobs out there anyway, so. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 But sex isn't the only signal being sent by cigarettes in the movies. By the 
middle of the health-obsessed, family-valuing, moralistic but hypocritical 
'80s, smoking began to be recast as the purview of the villain, the neurotic, 
the unstable, the corrupt. Bad cops (Richard Gere in "Internal Affairs"), bad 
moms (Anjelica Huston in "The Grifters") and coldhearted white-collar guys 
(Harrison Ford in "Regarding Henry") smoked, and generally they got their 
comeuppance for it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cigarettes were a flash card," says "Thank You for Smoking" author Buckley. 
"It was axiomatic: If a guy lit up, he wasn't in control of his own destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, smoking has shifted from being almost sociopathic behavior to 
taking on an edge of world-weary resignation, particularly in those films that 
lay claim to an understanding of Generation X's pain. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a device used to show recklessness," says Janeane Garofalo, who starred 
as Winona Ryder's pot-smoking, sex-without-strings, Gap-managing best friend in 
"Reality Bites." The smoker has become "a rebel, a gutsier person," she says. 
"And there's something liberating about not caring about the consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 In her West Hollywood neighborhood, Garofalo says, smokers feel so hunted that 
a sort of speak-easy mentality has emerged: "I think you're seeing a lot more 
young people smoking in coffeehouses. In places that look the other way, 
business is definitely improving." 
</P>
<P>
 Unrepentant smokers are rare among the politically correct, not to mention 
sponsor-conscious, world of television. ("We're discouraged by the network from 
showing main characters smoking," says "NYPD Blue" co-creator David Milch.) 
</P>
<P>
 But recently the tube has shown compassion for the tobacco-addicted on shows 
like "NYPD Blue" and miniseries like "Prime Suspect," on which smoking 
characters have struggled to quit. "Sipowicz was a smoker in the first two 
episodes," Milch says of the "NYPD Blues" character. "But when he got shot, he 
gave it up." Apparently getting shot works better than hypnotism. 
</P>
<P>
 And "Prime Suspect," the British miniseries that aired on PBS, has made Chief 
Inspector Jane Tennyson's smoking part of the evolving story line. In the first 
installment she smoked, in the second she quit, and in the third she struggled 
to stay on the wagon; simply knowing that she wanted to smoke somehow helped us 
understand her troubled nature better.  
</P>
<P>
 At least one new film takes smoking as human foible even further. In next 
month's "The Client" (from the book by John Grisham), Susan Sarandon plays a 
lawyer with a past who finally reaches a distant young boy -- by sharing her 
cigarette with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "It came out of character," says "Client" director Joel Schumacher. "She 
touches him so profoundly that when he reaches forward, if they were adults, he 
would kiss her. I'm sure we'll get a lot of criticism for that. I'm sure 
effigies of Susan will be burned." Sarandon, perhaps fearing the same thing, 
refused to approve any still photography that showed her smoking. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So it's no longer just the villains who inhale; now it's real people with real 
flaws and real weaknesses who smoke. Now smoking is being used to show 
vulnerability; it's a badge of humanity. 
</P>
<P>
 In the current "When a Man Loves a Woman," in which Meg Ryan portrays a 
recovering alcoholic wife and mother, the viewer is actually relieved to see 
her chain-smoking, because it means she hasn't taken another drink. 
</P>
<P>
 And in "The Client," at least a couple of the bad guys smoke only because the 
actors playing them, Anthony LaPaglia and Kim Coates, are heavy smokers 
themselves. "They're almost desperate without cigarettes," says Schumacher, who 
doesn't allow smoking on his sets unless it's part of a scene. "It's almost 
easier just to let them smoke." 
</P>
<P>
 Schumacher's concern for his actors is a good example of the way smoking has 
again become OK in film and television: We don't care as much about healthy 
people (particularly if they're playing villains). But give us men or women so 
troubled that they don't care whether they live or die -- so much in pain that 
they need the immediate comfort of a cigarette -- and for them, we can have 
compassion. One screenwriter who knows says: "Women love unhappy men. They find 
them sexy." 
</P>
<P>
 So maybe it's not the cigarettes themselves that make Bono or Bogart and Ethan 
Hawke appealing but what they represent -- a troubled person living in a 
troubled world, who, from a certain angle, when the smoke gets in his eyes, may 
look a little bit like you.*

FEARS OF A YAROSLAVSKY POLITICAL DYNASTY ARISE; ELECTIONS: THE COUNCILMAN'S 
WIFE CONSIDERS RUNNING FOR HIS 5TH DISTRICT SEAT. SHE HAS SUPPORT AND A 
DILEMMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Her name brings instant voter recognition. She is well liked and highly 
visible in her community. But if she runs for office, she will face charges 
that she is attempting to create a political dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the dilemma facing Barbara Yaroslavsky, who acknowledged last week 
that she is considering running for the City Council seat vacated by her 
husband, Zev, who was elected to the Board of Supervisors earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have been encouraged and flattered," Barbara Yaroslavsky said of interest 
shown by friends and political advisers in her possible quest for the seat her 
husband held for 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's one of the best-kept secrets in town," said real estate mogul Stanley 
Hirsh, a Studio City resident. She is bright, personable and involved in Jewish 
religious and charitable causes in a Westside and Sherman Oaks-based council 
district where Jewish voters exercise tremendous clout, Hirsh said, ticking off 
her attributes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she runs and she wins," added veteran Democratic political consultant 
Joe Cerrell. "I'm not saying it's a slam dunk, but she starts out with what is 
a very good political name in this city. And she can raise good sums of money 
with it." 
</P>
<P>
 But others say that having a Barbara Yaroslavsky on the City Council and a Zev 
Yaroslavsky on the Board of Supervisors would create a regrettable political 
dynasty. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too much in the same family," said Sandy Brown, a Westside activist who 
has frequently clashed with Zev Yaroslavsky on development issues. "If she 
runs, I think there'll be a backlash against it. We've already had 19 years of 
Zev and then to have eight years of another Yaroslavsky is too much," added 
Brown, who is president of the Holmby-Westwood Property Owners Assn. "It's too 
much like Chicago." If elected, term limits would restrict Barbara Yaroslavsky 
to at most eight years, and possibly to six years, on the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Los Angeles school board President Roberta Weintraub and Michael Feuer, 
executive director of Bet Tzedek, a legal services organization, so far have 
refrained from criticizing a possible Barbara Yaroslavsky bid for her husband's 
seat, but nevertheless say they will be running for Zev Yaroslavsky's seat 
regardless of how her plans shape up. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Interest in the 5th District succession race began to rise after Zev 
Yaroslavsky won election to the supervisor post June 7. In the aftermath, a 
bevy of would-be successors accelerated their own campaign activities to 
prepare for a special election to fill Yaroslavsky's council seat. Los Angeles 
City Council President John Ferraro, who in 1966 was the last person to be 
appointed to fill a council vacancy, said the likely scenario is that the 
council will vote to schedule a special election for April, 1995, that would be 
held at the same time as the regular municipal elections that month. 
</P>
<P>
 To hold the special 5th District election on a separate date would cost an 
extra quarter of a million dollars, according to the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, as talk of Barbara Yaroslavsky's candidacy picked up steam, Feuer, 
who is allied with progressive Democrats, ran an ad in the Jewish Journal 
listing many of his supporters and soliciting donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Feuer said his decision to run is irreversible and that he has even agreed to 
resign in December as head of Bet Tzedek so he can campaign full time. "There's 
no turning back," Feuer said last week, noting that Bet Tzedek's board of 
directors is already moving forward to pick his successor. 
</P>
<P>
 Feuer said he has raised about $40,000 in campaign funds on the basis of a 
city Ethics Commission ruling that such fund-raising could legally begin the 
day after Yaroslavsky was elected to the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Weintraub, once a registered Republican and leader of the city's 
San Fernando Valley anti-busing movement in the late 1970s, continued her own 
hectic pace by meeting with homeowner leaders and touring city parks and police 
stations in the 5th District to familiarize herself with key municipal 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going full bore on this," said Weintraub, who, as a born-again Democrat 
since 1991, recently endorsed feminist activist Sheila Kuehl's successful bid 
for the Democratic nomination for the 41st Assembly District seat based in the 
Westside and West Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past week, Lea Purwin D'Agostino, a deputy district attorney who 
ran a quixotic campaign in 1988 against her then-boss, Ira Reiner, also 
reportedly had several political meetings about running for the 5th District 
seat, while Bill Christopher, an architect and leading neighborhood activist, 
filed the paperwork necessary to raise money for the same race. Ryan Snyder, a 
transportation consultant who ran previously against Zev Yaroslavsky, filed his 
papers the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview, Barbara Yaroslavsky said she expects to discuss her possible 
run for his council seat with her husband soon. "We have been so busy with the 
election (for the Board of Supervisors) that I haven't sat down with Zev to go 
over the pros and cons of it," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although she said she was not fully prepared to discuss all the factors she 
considers relevant to the debate, Barbara Yaroslavsky remarked on a few of 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there'd be a comfort with me (as a council candidate), because I've 
been involved with the community and all sorts of charitable activities over 
the years," she said. She currently serves on the governing board of the LA 
Free Clinic, on the Metro Board of the Los Angeles Jewish Federation Council 
and on the executive board of the Bureau of Jewish Education. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "In my own right I've done a lot," Barbara Yaroslavsky said. On the other 
hand, if her husband, who lives and breathes politics, were to contend that her 
entrance in the race might reflect badly on him, "I'd have to take that into 
consideration," she said. "But I don't see that happening at all." 
</P>
<P>
 And if her husband advised her not to run, how would she react? 
</P>
<P>
 "He wouldn't say that," she said. "That's not the way our relationship works." 
Others who know the couple agree. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are those who are convinced Zev Yaroslavsky privately does not want 
his wife to seek his seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think he's enthusiastic at all about this," said one knowledgeable 
source active in Westside political circles. "It could be that he thinks it 
would hurt him politically or that he doesn't want to share the spotlight." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked recently about his wife's prospective political career, Yaroslavsky 
refused to comment. "Talk to my wife," he has said. Inevitably, talk of Barbara 
Yaroslavsky's candidacy raises the dynasty issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a hereditary monarchy," scoffed one critic, who, nevertheless, 
asked for anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cerrell and other observers say such gut-level biases can be deflected in 
large part because Barbara Yaroslavsky appears to be an independent-minded and 
credible candidate in her own right. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly there will be those who resent a Barbara Yaroslavsky candidacy 
regardless of her qualifications, but there are plenty of examples of 
politically successful dynasties, Cerrell added, citing the Kennedys and the 
Brown family in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just don't see it as a problem," Barbara Yaroslavsky herself said last 
week, contending that opportunities for her and her husband to coordinate their 
powerful positions to achieve ends that are at odds with the public interest 
would actually be limited. County and city government activities don't overlap 
that much, she said. "There's too much independence," she said. "They'd have to 
feed off each other for there to be a dynasty problem." And if there's a fear 
that she and her husband would be monolithic in their view -- that's 
unjustified too, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zev doesn't come home and chew over what he's doing at work all day," Barbara 
Yaroslavsky said. "He doesn't bring it home. He doesn't come to me to ask me 
what to do and I don't go to him and ask him what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But at least one critic, who asked that he not be named, said conflicts 
between the city and county jurisdictions do arise over a variety of issues, 
including, for example, the allocation of parking ticket revenues and 
transportation dollars. It has got to be messy when the decision-making is 
being made under one roof, this critic said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still others, like Sandy Brown, the Westside activist, say the issue runs even 
deeper, striking at the issue of fairness. "My concern really is what kind of 
arm-twisting will Zev do to get her elected," Brown said. How many people with 
business at the county will want to deny a powerful supervisor's wife a 
campaign contribution and their support? Brown asked. And after Barbara 
Yaroslavsky, who's next? "Their teen-age daughter?" Brown sarcastically 
quipped.

VALLEY BRIEFING: GETTING BURNED; ENJOY THE SUMMER SUN, BUT BE CAREFUL

 It's that time again, when sun worshipers flock to swimming pools and beaches 
to soak up rays. But for some people, a "healthy tan" may not be healthy at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1973, the rate of melanoma, the deadliest form of skin cancer, has 
increased by 4% each year, according to the American Cancer Society. The most 
recent state figures available show that 802 Californians -- including 185 
people in Los Angeles County -- died of melanoma in 1991. Aside from melanoma, 
people can also contract basal cell or squamous cell cancers, which are highly 
curable, but usually with surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 While the depleted ozone layer is placing everyone at greater risk for skin 
cancer, there are some precautions that can be taken. Says Dr. Allan S. 
Wirtzer, a Sherman Oaks dermatologist: "There is no such thing as a safe tan." 
Tips on Sun Exposure 
</P>
<P>
 * Stay out of the sun between 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. when the rays are the 
strongest. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use sunscreen with a sun protection factor (SPF) of 15 or stronger; and one 
which protects against both UV-A and UV-B rays. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use a waterproof sunscreen if you plan to be in the water or expect to 
perspire heavily. 
</P>
<P>
 * Sunburns received from infancy to teen years can increase the risk of 
contracting melanoma as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wear a wide-brimmed hat and clothes with a tight weave. 
</P>
<P>
 * If you've been using a self-tanning product, you still need to use sunscreen 
when you're in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 * Temperature has little to do with sun exposure. Ultraviolet radiation is 
strong on relatively cool days and can penetrate clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 * Light-skinned people are more likely to burn. Warning Signs 
</P>
<P>
 Changes in moles can be an early warning sign of skin cancer, so the American 
Cancer Society recommends that adults examine their skin once a month. People 
who have atypical moles are considered to be at a higher risk of getting 
melanoma. Check the "A,B,C and D" of moles: 
</P>
<P>
 * A is for asymmetry, when both halves of the mole don't match each other. 
</P>
<P>
 * B is for border, when the border is ragged, blurred or irregular. 
</P>
<P>
 * C is for color, when the color of the mole is not the same throughout or has 
shades of tan, brown, black, red, white or blue. 
</P>
<P>
 * D is for diameter, if the diameter of the mole is larger than a pencil 
eraser. Changes in moles should be reported to a dermatologist. How the Skin 
Tans 
</P>
<P>
 1. The epidermis is penetrated by rays, reaching the underlying dermis. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Blood vessels dilate and more blood flows to near the surface. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Rays stimulate certain cells to produce more melanin, the skin pigment that 
darkens the skin. Treating Sunburns 
</P>
<P>
 The treatment of sunburns is the same for all first-degree burns: 
</P>
<P>
 Soak the affected area for 15 minutes in cold water (not ice water) or apply a 
cold compress. Applying aloe vera will cool the burn. Anti-inflammatory pain 
medicine, such as aspirin or ibuprofen may also help, as well as 
hydro-cortisone creams. 
</P>
<P>
 There are other topical creams available, but some people can develop 
sensitivities to them. If you are sunburned all over, consider taking a bath 
with a cup of dry instant oatmeal scattered in the water. Other physicians have 
recommended adding vinegar or milk to the water. Second-degree sunburns result 
in blisters, which might mean a trip to the dermatologist's office if pain 
persists for more than a day. Tanning Salons  
</P>
<P>
 About two million people a year visit tanning salons. But how safe are they? 
</P>
<P>
 Tanning beds give off mostly UV-A radiation, which is less likely to cause an 
immediate burn than UV-B rays. However, UV-A penetrates the skin more deeply 
and causes it to prematurely age. Last year, researchers at the Brookhaven 
Laboratory in New York reported that UV-A is equally important in causing 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is moderation is the name of the game," said Bob Rogers, president 
of Miami Tan, which has a total of eight tanning salons in the San Fernando and 
Santa Clarita valleys. He says people who tan two to three times a week, for no 
more than 30 minutes each session, seem to have a happier, healthier outlook on 
life because they look healthier and feel better about themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're willing to take that risk," Rogers said. Skin Cancer Statistics

FORTUNATE DADS; 2 NEW PARENTS FOLLOWED HARD PATH FOR JOY OF CELEBRATING 
FATHER'S DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ABIGAIL GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In years to come, when their sons are old enough to come home late, slam doors 
and talk back, there are two San Fernando Valley parents who might gain 
patience by remembering their long routes to fatherhood. 
</P>
<P>
 For one of the new dads, even the idea of having a baby was beginning to seem 
improbable, if not impossible, until his wife finally got pregnant. She had 
twins, but they were born premature and spent their first weeks in the hospital 
rather than the nursery. The two boys slept in their own cribs for the first 
time one week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've waited my entire life to be a father and celebrate Father's Day," said 
Joshua Pine, 29, who one week ago brought his sons, Nathan and Jacob, home from 
their one-month stay in a neonatal intensive care unit. "I had to struggle to 
get them. It makes me more appreciative." 
</P>
<P>
 The other dad, Joe Foster, calls his son a miracle baby. 
</P>
<P>
 After his wife was diagnosed with cancer, parenthood seemed sadly distant. The 
best they could hope for, they thought, was adopting a young child several 
years down the line. But the Fosters got their 5-month-old son just weeks after 
listing themselves with an agency. 
</P>
<P>
 For thousands of dads, especially for those who may have received one too many 
ties or silly mugs filled with golf tees, Father's Day may be just an annual 
event. But for these two men, it's all new and a true celebration, not of 
themselves but of the sons who seemed so unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe and Constance Foster decided to adopt a child after Constance, 40, had 
surgery for cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Joe said, he had always assumed he would take in at least one 
child who was not originally his own. There are so many children in need of 
loving parents, it just seemed inevitable somehow, said Joe, 39. 
</P>
<P>
 Just after the couple finished their 10-week parenting class as part of 
pre-adoption requirements -- and almost exactly one year after Constance found 
out she was sick -- the city told the Fosters last August that there was a baby 
boy waiting to meet them. They named their son Cameron. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never gave up hope on that," Joe said, watching his 14-month-old son chase 
a beach ball around the family's Van Nuys living room. "I knew I'd have a kid 
if it was meant to be." 
</P>
<P>
 For now, Joe delights in his fatherly routine. Sunday mornings, while 
Constance sleeps, he wakes Cameron and makes him breakfast. Joe makes certain 
to include one sweet thing that Constance would never dream of feeding their 
son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mothers sometimes," Joe said, shaking his head and laughing with his wife. 
"If he wants it, I don't mind." 
</P>
<P>
 After listening to his father's voice, Cameron reached out to Joe, a sign he 
wanted to be picked up. Once on daddy's lap, he babbled as babies do, and Joe 
nodded along as if he understood perfectly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh-huh," Joe said soothingly, rubbing the boy's back. "Uh-huh. Yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 Cameron looked at his father, brown eyes bright and wide, and smiled a toothy 
grin. 
</P>
<P>
 Cathryn and Joshua Pine had been trying to have a baby for three years. After 
a miscarriage a year and a half ago and another round of attempts, the 
possibilities did not look good. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, Cathy, 30, became pregnant. But word that the 4-foot-10-inch woman 
was carrying twins brought all new worries. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple endured eight months of long, hard waiting. Cathy was bedridden for 
the last 12 weeks of her pregnancy and hospitalized twice, trying to forestall 
labor. 
</P>
<P>
 When the boys were finally born, one month early, they were unable to feed and 
had trouble breathing. The two were placed in intensive care and the couple was 
told the babies would stay after Cathy was released. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you actually finally leave the hospital without them, it hits you like a 
ton of bricks," Josh said. "I'm leaving without my babies." 
</P>
<P>
 The worst part, he said, was that they could not hold their children. The boys 
had intravenous needles in their heads -- the best place to find a vein on a 
baby -- feeding tubes in their throats and were under ultraviolet lights. The 
only time the parents were allowed to pick up the children was during attempts 
to bottle-feed them. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I got real emotional," Josh said. "Knowing my kids were there and 
I couldn't even touch them." 
</P>
<P>
 It was 12 anxious days before the babies came home. Josh would leave his 
Agoura home every morning for a quick visit at Encino-Tarzana Regional Medical 
Center before a commute to his Burbank job. After work, he would drive back to 
Agoura to pick up Cathy, who could not drive while she recovered from her 
Cesarean section, and head back to the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 One month after their birthday, the boys were allowed to go home. On Saturday, 
their parents prepared for their bris , the Jewish ceremony celebrating 
circumcision and a boy's entrance into the faith. 
</P>
<P>
 It was both a relief and joy for Josh -- the bris, this first Father's Day and 
finally being able to show off his children to all his friends and family. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make it a point every so often to look back and remember what it 
took to bring these kids into the world," Josh said. "We have been really 
waiting for this day. It's been a long road."

JUDGE HANDS DOWN SENTENCES, SYMPATHY; COURT: JURIST CALLS TOPANGA COUPLE HONEST 
IDEALISTS IN THEIR LONG, BITTER FIGHT WITH COUNTY BUILDING DEPARTMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 At one point, he compared them to a drunk who walks into the same tree so many 
times he thinks he's in a forest. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in the end, a judge showered sympathy on a Topanga couple convicted last 
month of a total of 16 criminal charges of building a house without a permit, 
suspending sentence on all but four of the charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing last week climaxed a four-year battle between the couple -- 
Arthur Starz and Kathleen Kenny -- and the Los Angeles County Department of 
Building and Safety, in which the couple alleged that they were prosecuted only 
because they resisted attempts by building inspectors to extort bribes in 
return for a permit to replace a house on a lot they own in Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had earlier indicated he might throw the book at them if they did 
not plead guilty and avoid a lengthy trial, Malibu Superior Court Judge James 
A. Albracht struck a conciliatory note as the curtain came down -- openly 
sympathizing with the people he was sentencing and lashing out at the building 
department. 
</P>
<P>
 "Heaven forbid the Building and Safety Department should descend and inspect 
my house, your house, or anybody's house," Albracht said, criticizing the 
system for giving inspectors too much discretionary power. 
</P>
<P>
 Albracht brusquely rejected the prosecutor's insistence that he send one of 
the defendants to jail for the misdemeanor offenses, saying he considered the 
couple honest idealists who "didn't want to do the dancing you have to do to 
cooperate with Building and Safety." 
</P>
<P>
 Charges were brought against Kenny and Starz, who live in a 600-square-foot 
house they built on one of their three lots in the Fernwood area, after they 
published several issues of a newsletter that sharply criticized officials' 
handling of their application for a permit to build a second house. 
</P>
<P>
 With hostility already aroused by the quarrel over the second house, building 
officials then accused them of constructing a third house without permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple said they merely refurbished an old house on the lot, after 
obtaining oral permission from county officials under the "continuing 
maintenance" rule of the Building and Safety Code, and were then prosecuted 
because they refused to pay bribes. 
</P>
<P>
 During a hearing in February, Kenny and Starz both testified and their 
attorney, James Fosbinder, called several county employees as witnesses in an 
attempt to show they were victims of an extortion attempt. 
</P>
<P>
 Albracht, however, cut the testimony short after more than a week, saying he 
thought the couple had brought their problems upon themselves by incessantly 
writing letters and putting themselves in the spotlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that if she in fact received some selective treatment, it was because 
she made herself conspicuous," Albracht said. "I think Ms. Kenny has evidenced, 
in this proceeding at least, a paranoia with regard to this. In my opinion, it 
is a self-fulfilling prophesy." 
</P>
<P>
 Albracht tried unsuccessfully to persuade Kenny and Starz to plead guilty, 
promising not to send them to jail or fine them more than $5,000. The deal 
would be off, he sternly warned, if they went on with the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Refusing the offer, Kenny and Starz testified in their trial last month that 
they spent a year trying to get a permit for the house, paying $8,000 in 
application fees, only to be blocked by county officials. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury convicted Kenny on two counts and Starz on 14 counts after deliberating 
four days. 
</P>
<P>
 At their sentencing Wednesday, Albracht reasserted his conviction that there 
was no plot against them, but rebuked Deputy Dist. Atty. Joan Clay Manley's 
argument that they should be punished severely for defying the system. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seldom have there been people in my court who, in the face of many, many 
adverse rulings, have accepted them with (such) enormous courtesy," Albracht 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Manley persisted in asking him to send Starz to jail for 90 days and 
impose the maximum fines against both, Albracht retorted that he would have 
been happy if the jury had acquitted them, in spite of what he said was their 
obvious guilt. 
</P>
<P>
 "My assessment as I observed this case go to the jury was the only chance the 
defendants had of prevailing was some sort of jury nullification, that the jury 
would fly in the face of the law," Albracht said. 
</P>
<P>
 "My visceral response was it wouldn't have mattered to me if they did, and I 
would have liked to have seen Mr. Starz and Miss Kenny prevail on that in some 
way, because they seem like very decent people." 
</P>
<P>
 In a lengthy monologue, Albracht said he sympathized with anyone trying to 
work with regulators who have so much discretion. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have a real problem when you have a regulatory system with criminal 
penalties wherein truly total discretion is in the hands of the regulators. 
There is obviously the potential for the misuse of that, and you don't have any 
kind of bright line for people who want to follow it. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Particularly in Topanga, where a hundred percent of the houses are out of 
code, it's hard to say this is the code people should follow when nobody 
follows it, and things are bootlegged in everywhere you look." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Albracht said he would not shrink from punishing the couple. He 
ordered Starz and Kenny to pay fines of $2,500 plus penalty assessments. 
</P>
<P>
 He also put Kenny and Starz on probation with a condition that they obtain a 
building permit for the house within one year. If they fail, he said, he may 
decide to order the house torn down. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny said she was relieved by the outcome, but was still concerned that 
county officials will continue to withhold the permit. 
</P>
<P>
 The conclusion of the criminal trial does not end the legal saga of the small 
house on Cave Lane. 
</P>
<P>
 A California Coastal Commission lawsuit alleging that Kenny and Starz built it 
in the coastal zone without a permit from the commission is scheduled to go to 
trial Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Starz and Kenny also have filed a federal racketeering and due-process lawsuit 
against Los Angeles County. After dismissing the racketeering portion of that 
case, the original judge took himself off the case. A hearing on the couple's 
amended complaint is expected to be heard by a new judge in August.

MOTORCYCLIST IS KILLED IN CRASH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An unidentified motorcyclist was killed early Saturday when he apparently lost

pole, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident happened as the man traveled north on Balboa Boulevard near 
Woodley Avenue, Los Angeles Police Officer Clark Baker said. The motorcyclist 
was found about 2:30 a.m. by passing motorists and was taken to Holy Cross 
Hospital in Mission Hills, where he died soon afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 The motorcyclist was described as a white male in his 20s and was riding a 
1988 Kawasaki Ninja. Authorities said he carried no identification.

ANTELOPE VALLEY TEACHERS STEP UP PAY DEMANDS; EDUCATION: THEY TOOK 7% CUTS IN 
1992 BUT ARE NOW OFFERED A MAXIMUM 2% RAISE. UNION VOTES FOR IMPASSE AND 
PROTEST. 
</P>

 Teachers in the Antelope Valley Union High School District have had it. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago they agreed to cuts in their wages and benefits when the 
district faced bankruptcy. Now that the district has recovered from its fiscal 
crisis, the high school teachers want their pay returned to previous levels -- 
something they contend was promised when they agreed to the cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 District negotiators, however, are offering a maximum 2% salary increase, less 
than one-third of the 7% cut that was imposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the teachers are going on the offensive. In a union vote last week, the 
teachers strongly supported declaring an impasse in their negotiations with the 
district on July 1 if their wages and benefits are not fully restored by then. 
</P>
<P>
 They also voted to demonstrate outside the hotel where a farewell party is to 
be held later this month for the fiscal adviser assigned to the district after 
its dire financial position was discovered. Now that the district has repaid an 
$8-million county loan, the county-assigned adviser is no longer needed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the teachers overwhelmingly agreed to support any recall effort 
mounted against the board's conservative majority -- President Billy Pricer and 
members Sue Stokka and Tony Welch -- because of their refusal to administer the 
controversial California Learning Assessment System test until ordered by a 
judge. 
</P>
<P>
 "The current board we have, while I believe they're well-meaning people, (has) 
done nothing to endear themselves to the teachers," said Jim Gardner, outgoing 
president of the Antelope Valley Teachers Assn. "The things that they have done 
have alienated the teachers." 
</P>
<P>
 His organization is also taking out a full-page ad in a local paper, detailing 
what teachers have done to help the district through its crisis and assailing 
the district for poor spending decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Pricer believes the union's plans will merely make it look foolish. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a mentality that if you put enough pressure you can squeeze 
the goose that lays the golden egg," the board president said. "But there's 
nothing to squeeze out." 
</P>
<P>
 Supt. Robert Girolamo said there is not enough money in the budget to restore 
everything that was cut over the past two years. "We're fiscally solvent now, 
(but) we're still fiscally fragile." 
</P>
<P>
 Union officials, however, said the district is spending money inappropriately, 
such as opening a second continuation school and reinstating high-paying 
administrative jobs cut during the height of the financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardner said teachers have also had to deal with class sizes of 45 students 
along with fewer materials, textbooks and other supplies. "We didn't do it 
willingly, but we did it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers have even spent their own money to buy toilet paper for student 
restrooms and paper to photocopy tests. Now, they believe, enough is enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were promised that everything would return to the prior level once the 
district's finances were restored," said Gardner. "There was a clear, clear 
understanding that was to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 But Pricer denies that any such promises were made. Although he empathizes 
with the teachers' plight, Pricer said they are not being realistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been advised that we can only do so much," he said. "Reality dictates 
you look around on a statewide basis. The money just isn't there anymore. Our 
financial situation statewide is only going to get worse before it gets 
better." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the district has repaid the $8-million loan, Stokka said the 
district is not able to restore all the cuts it was forced to make, including 
the teachers' pay cut. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would put our district right back in a state of bankruptcy," she said. "It 
would be totally irresponsible. We're not going to put the district at that 
kind of risk." 
</P>
<P>
 The union, however, believes the district does have enough money to restore 
the teachers' pay. If an impasse is declared, an independent fact-finder will 
review the district's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is the opinion of our association (the fact-finder) will find the money, 
that we can restore the 7%," Gardner said. "They want to be very cautious and 
not get themselves back into a hole, and they think not giving the teachers 
what they deserve will do that."

PRESIDENT OF CARSON NAACP UNIT IS OUSTED; LEADERSHIP: AFTER TRYING TO HIT A 
MEMBER, THE BRANCH LEADER WAS GRANTED A HEARING AND THEN WAS NOTIFIED OF HIS 
IMMEDIATE REMOVAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The president of the Carson / Torrance branch of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People has been removed from office for attempting to 
hit another member of the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Marvin Clayton, 53, was informed of his immediate removal in a May 24 letter 
from William H. Penn, a director in the NAACP's national office in Baltimore. 
Clayton, who admitted last week that he lost his temper and tried to hit 
executive committee member Joe Alford, said he would abide by the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "If that's the feeling of the national office, I'll just yield," Clayton said. 
"If they feel someone else can do it better, so be it." 
</P>
<P>
 Penn would not comment on the letter, which directed Clayton to turn over the 
branch's records to the group's first vice president, Shirley Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton, who works in the community development department of the Friendship 
Children's Center in Carson, also owns a private security firm. He said that in 
1978, he helped found the Carson chapter, which has grown to 200 members. It is 
one of 72 NAACP chapters in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing the national organization's rules against members talking to the news 
media, none of the local members contacted this week would comment on the 
matter. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a copy of Penn's letter obtained by The Times said a complaint filed 
against Clayton accused him of misappropriating funds from the branch, refusing 
to operate within the group's bylaws, improperly recruiting members and 
"attempting an assault upon another member of the Carson / Torrance branch 
during an executive committee meeting." 
</P>
<P>
 The attempted assault was the basis for Clayton's removal, the letter said. 
The letter did not address the other charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton said Alford accused him of using chapter money for personal reasons. 
During an argument over the allegations during a Dec. 9 committee meeting, 
Clayton said he lost his temper and tried to grab Alford, but was restrained by 
other members. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was more verbal than anything," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After a complaint was filed with the national office, Penn traveled to Carson 
to hear arguments from both sides. The national board of the NAACP later voted 
to remove Clayton from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Clayton said the fact that he didn't actually hit Alford is grounds for 
appeal, but he will not pursue it because he is too busy with other activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I intended to hurt him . . . but I didn't," Clayton said. "That's my whole 
point." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the other accusations against him were not valid. Clayton said he 
would retain his membership and support the group's goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important that (an) NAACP chapter exist in the city of Carson -- 
whoever is president," Clayton said.

INTERACTIVE MEDIA PIONEERS MOOOVING AHEAD; BUSINESS: PASADENA ART SCHOOL 
FOURSOME NAME THEIR ENTERPRISE COW, WIN SOME AWARDS AND BEGIN LINING UP 
POSSIBLE CONTRACTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENISE HAMILTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Funny how things change. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, they were four struggling art students, waiting outside the doors 
of ad agencies to show their portfolios. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they spent six frenetic months of their own time creating an electronic 
catalogue for their school, Pasadena's prestigious Art Center College of 
Design, where they applied all the design, graphics and computer skills they 
had learned in class. 
</P>
<P>
 Their work impressed so many people that the Pasadena foursome decided to form 
a company to specialize in interactive design, an enterprise they christened 
with the whimsical name of COW. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, with one of their team still in school, all but one under 30 and no 
professional contracts to their name, COW has already won a couple of awards 
and has several firms lined up that are interested in doing business. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the company hasn't landed its first job yet, much less delivered 
on that job. But some of the people who award those contracts are expecting 
great things. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they're really smart, really talented, and I would love to work with 
them," gushes Jonathan Wiedemann, executive producer of the new media division 
of Propaganda Films, the stylish Hollywood company whose top-notch directors 
and technicians have produced everything from Madonna music videos to David 
Lynch's "Twin Peaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of small start-ups are vying for recognition in the field of 
interactive media, so-called because users navigate their way through a 
computer program that prompts them for information about what they want to see. 
Electronic directories at malls are the most familiar example. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics complain that much of the interactive media on the market today is 
confusing, boring or both, filled with large blocks of text, unappealing 
graphics and maze-like paths that leave users frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, many of these same critics say that COW has brought to the 
technology a sophisticated new level of design, learned at one of the top 
schools in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry mavens praise COW's style, which uses a lot of images and a minimum 
of text. Their program entices the user through a fast-moving blend of visuals, 
sound, type and graphics. The COW technique also uses film prominently, 
favoring herky-jerky off-center editing, hand-held cameras and a barrage of 
images. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the interactive catalogue that the foursome did for the Art Center, 
which funded the cost of their supplies. The user starts learning about the 
school by sitting down at a computer kiosk in the Art Center gallery and 
touching the screen to select from a menu of photo icons. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on the icon chosen, the user is propelled through film, text, 
animation and photos through the Art Center in Pasadena, the school's 
Switzerland campus, its colorful history or the creative vision of its 
president. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some interactive programs, the team's design makes it easy to switch 
from one path of inquiry to another. Another menu is overlaid in the 
background, where one touch brings it back into focus while the first one 
recedes. Users move through interviews with celebrated Art Center alumni, 
screening student commercials or viewing prototypes of sports cars designed in 
classes. 
</P>
<P>
 COW's interactive program brings the Art Center to virtual life in a way that 
would require an all-day tour in real time. All that's missing is the smell of 
sage that grows amid the hillside campus' sleek, modernistic buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knocked my socks off," declares Jeannine Parker, president of the 
International Interactive Communications Society. "I think they have an 
incredible future. They've already separated themselves from the pack. It's not 
just how you present information, but how you give the user a way to navigate 
through it. They've made it much easier to navigate." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps that is because of the blend of artistic background and computer 
literacy among the young entrepreneurs: Dina Temkin, 25 (film and editing); 
John Grotting, 28, (graphics), Bryan Dorsey, 25, (graphics and packaging) and 
Mateo Neri, 31 (graphics). 
</P>
<P>
 The last three are Art Center graduates. Grotting just received his degree 
this month. Temkin graduates this September. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the name COW? 
</P>
<P>
 "Because things are too complicated today, and we wanted something simple that 
everyone would understand, because that's what we're trying to do with this 
media, that's our design philosophy," Dorsey says. 
</P>
<P>
 In keeping with that, their logo is a toy wooden cow they assembled from 
children's building blocks. Their office is in a California Craftsman house in 
Northwest Pasadena, which they like because it is funky, a far cry from the 
sterility of a commercial office. It is also Grotting's home, and he tends to 
the group's meager cache of computer and video equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 For now they want to stay lean and mean. It's silly, they figure, to spend 
tons of money right now in a field where equipment becomes obsolete every six 
months. Ditto for hiring. COW anticipates assembling specialists in graphic 
design, film and editing as projects come their way. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the core four, there is a loose and easy familiarity. They finish each 
others' sentences, with one expanding on a creative idea tossed out by another, 
such as the potential for film imagery in interactive design. 
</P>
<P>
 At brainstorming sessions they sit on the carpeted floor; there are no chairs 
or desks. The "grunge" riffs of KROQ radio blast from a portable radio while 
herb tea brews in the kitchen. All but Neri have earrings and long hair. 
</P>
<P>
 After their success with the Art Center catalogue, they decided to form their 
own small creative shop. Grotting had taken a three-year break from school to 
work as an art director at the international ad agency DDB Needham in Finland 
and hated it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't creative. It was managing real big projects that were so mundane," 
he recalls. "It's interesting, the bigger the budget, the lower the 
creativity."  
</P>
<P>
 One of their first tasks is to draw up a business plan, meeting with lawyers, 
figuring out copyright laws and deciding which segment of the expanding 
interactive market they want to penetrate. 
</P>
<P>
 COW partners say they like interactive games and music discs but their 
ambitions lie elsewhere. They want to design new ways of communicating in 
business and education, such as kiosks that introduce new products or programs 
that teach students about World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "We actually have in our biographies that we're not game makers. We're not 
hackers. We're not interested in a game that's going to sell millions," Dorsey 
says. "Games are not solving problems, they're just BS entertainment, and we're 
into solving problems. We want to develop tools that are going to influence 
this medium." 
</P>
<P>
 Grotting is the interface specialist, with a knack for designing ways for 
users to interact with the computer to get where they want. Last year, a 
computer interface designed by a group of Art Center students that included 
Grotting won first place in a competition sponsored by Apple Computer Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, COW has had an impact on the Art Center, says school President David 
R. Brown. After seeing the success of the interactive catalogue, the school set 
up a "digital sandbox" for students to experiment with interactive media 
projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "They pointed the way," Brown says. "It's going to be very cool around here 
for awhile. We have an opportunity to become leaders in the education of design 
for interactive media." 
</P>
<P>
 COW expects to sign off shortly on its first professional contract, creating 
seven interactive kiosks for Nissan Motors that would introduce customers to 
their line of vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 The company also has made presentations to Celebrity Cruise Lines, Pacificare 
health care, Apple Computers, American Express and Propaganda Films. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been profiled in Daily Variety and in Online Design. And they have 
been courted -- to no avail -- by ad agencies and firms that would like to 
incorporate them into their stables of whiz kids, a hedge against future 
crashes on the "information superhighway." 
</P>
<P>
 "They want us to educate them," Grotting says. "They don't know what to do 
with the medium." 
</P>
<P>
 COW has little interest in being swallowed; its brain trust has other plans. A 
retired Art Center professor who ran a CPA firm for the entertainment industry 
is so enthralled that he undertook to raise $1.5 million in capital for them 
through his Hollywood contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the epitome of Marshall McLuhan's 'the medium is the message'; it 
takes something static and makes it dynamic," says Errol Gerson, who for 24 
years taught business management to budding artists. "The implications for 
corporate communications are staggering. I was so impressed with what they had 
done that I broke my rules, which are, one, never get involved with a start-up, 
and two, never get involved with students." 
</P>
<P>
 Another who was wowed is Richard Cassey, an associate at SHR Perceptual 
Management, a marketing firm in Scottsdale, Ariz., that works with auto 
companies and cruise lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassey researched interactive firms across the country and concluded that COW 
was "one of the top two." He envisions hiring the group to design interactive 
kiosks for auto dealerships and travel agencies. Interactive books are another 
possibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "COW was the one that really impressed us. They break down the barriers of 
fear of the technology," Cassey says. "Not many companies are doing that. 
Either they're very creative but the stuff doesn't flow, or they're very 
technologically oriented but not creative." 
</P>
<P>
 One industry figure, while admitting he'd like to lure the COW founders to his 
stable, says the Art Center students have yet to make the leap from small art 
school boutique to big player in the interactive field. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until they land a major gig and produce something under real world 
constraints and pressures, the jury's really still out," says the man, who 
requested anonymity. But Greg Thomas, an interactive media engineer with Apple 
Computer Inc. who has seen COW's work, believes the group has what it takes. He 
predicts there will be shakeout in the interactive field in the next 1 1/2 
years and that COW will emerge strong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was impressed. They have good design skills, and the way the market's 
going, we are always going to have companies that need interactive 
presentations," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 COW's forays into interactive media began in April, 1993, when Dorsey had an 
idea to do an interactive yearbook with Neri. They were told Grotting would be 
essential to their team, so they enlisted his help. Kent Campbell, who has 
since left the group to work as creative director at another interactive 
company, signed on as producer. Along the way they hooked up with Temkin, whose 
film and photography skills brought visual punch to their designs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the group opted to pitch the idea of an interactive college catalogue to 
Brown, the Art Center president, instead of a yearbook because they knew it 
would be an easier sell -- most students wouldn't shell out the money or have 
the equipment for a CD-ROM yearbook. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown gave them an office, a $20,000 budget and free run of high-tech 
facilities for editing, photography and computers. The students even 
commissioned product design students Todd Bell and Bobby Chang to create the 
sleek wood-and-steel kiosk for the catalogue and hired others to do the music. 
Grotting estimates that the interactive kiosk would have cost about $400,000 if 
students hadn't labored for free using equipment and labs provided by the 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 They worked six months, using volunteer student film crews, raiding the 
archives, sleeping on couches in the office after 18-hour days. The interactive 
catalogue, which later won a Design Distinction Award in Graphics from the 1994 
Annual Design Review, was unveiled late last year at a design and media 
conference in Kitakyushu, Japan, a city that is gunning to be the interactive 
media capital in the 21st Century. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown says a headline in the local Japanese paper the next day read: "He 
touched the screen and the audience went 'Wow.' "

WESTSIDE WATCH: ON THE HOMELESS ISSUE, THE COUNCIL'S NOT KIDDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Monica City Councilman Ken Genser's put-down of one of his council 
colleagues the other night may become fodder for his political enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because an emerging issue in the city is whether the current City 
Council majority, which includes Genser, is more sympathetic to the homeless 
than to schoolkids. 
</P>
<P>
 At last week's council meeting, Genser accused Asha Greenberg of acting like 
an emotional mother, not a deliberate policy-maker, because she wanted to 
enforce the park closure law in Memorial Park. The Little League season is in 
full swing, and parents and league officials have complained about the large 
homeless contingent there. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg's son, as a recent Times article noted, was spotted sitting on the 
park grass with his coach one night, surrounded by homeless people. Genser 
referred to the article in his remarks, apparently concluding that Greenberg 
wanted to close the park to protect her son. 
</P>
<P>
 Replied Greenberg: "That was really uncalled-for." Later, she said: "I don't 
think (some of my colleagues) are sensitive to children." 
</P>
<P>
 The insensitivity to kids issue arose a few months ago when parents from a 
local elementary school complained to the council that a homeless woman had 
defecated on the school lawn in front of their children. For their part, Little 
League officials last month called council members "non-breeders." 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the council's seven members are parents. Only one of these parents, 
Tony Vazquez, is part of the five-member pro-rent-control majority on the 
council. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 QUEEN FOR A DAY: City Council members wore purple T-shirts. The mayor? He wore 
a shimmery little go-go number cut up to here.  
</P>
<P>
 And the throngs in West Hollywood last Sunday for the gay and lesbian pride 
parade wouldn't have had it any other way. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor -- for the day, anyway -- was RuPaul, the drag queen and dance-chart 
diva who's adorned his NBA-sized frame with everything from feather boas to 
stiletto heels. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers picked RuPaul as honorary mayor and celebrity grand marshal to mark 
the 25th anniversary of the gay rights movement, born in 1969 when 
transvestites and others rioted after police raided a New York City gay bar. 
</P>
<P>
 "We thought . . . it would be apropos to have a drag queen as grand marshal," 
said parade president Michael Yates. "The biggest drag queen on the face of the 
Earth right now is RuPaul." 
</P>
<P>
 The parade crowd loved him, and the feeling was mutual. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in tears," Yates said. 
</P>
<P>

 BEACH BALLOT: Santa Monicans, who usually vote in larger numbers than do folks 
in other cities, were about as apathetic as everyone else June 7, with a 32.4% 
turnout. 
</P>
<P>
 How did the liberal beach community vote this time out? 
</P>
<P>
 * Santa Monica may be his power base, but in his bid to become the Democratic 
nominee for governor, State Sen. Tom Hayden came in second to Kathleen Brown, 
losing to her by more than 2,000 votes. John Garamendi trailed Hayden in the 
city by about a thousand votes. 
</P>
<P>
 * State Sen. David A. Roberti, a longtime champion of rent control, was 
defeated in Santa Monica in his bid to become the Democratic nominee for state 
treasurer. Phil Angelides, who won the contest statewide, beat him in Santa 
Monica by a few hundred votes. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the 41st Assembly District Democratic primary, Sheila James Kuehl, with 
the support of rent control advocates, received 5,656 votes in Santa Monica. 
The candidate who rated second with Santa Monica voters, Pat McGuire, was left 
in the dust with 1,001 votes.

PRESERVATION PLAN SAID TO BE 7 YEARS TOO LATE; MIRACLE MILE SOUTH: PANEL IS 
TOLD THAT CULTURAL HERITAGE COMMISSION FAILED TO MEET A 1987 DEADLINE TO SUBMIT 
AN ARCHITECTURAL SURVEY FOR A PROPOSED HISTORIC ZONE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT COLLINS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The eight-year tug-of-war over historic preservation in the Miracle Mile South 
area has taken an unexpected turn in recent weeks: One group of bureaucrats has 
accused another of missing a key procedural deadline -- by seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 The snag means the effort to designate the neighborhood a "historic 
preservation overlay zone," or HPOZ, to protect older and architecturally 
significant buildings has been delayed indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents, already wearied by the long effort to get the zone, seemed 
fatalistic after learning of the setback. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sort of numb," said Denise Robb, founder of the Miracle Mile Action 
Committee, a residents group. "We've been (leading the fight for an HPOZ) for 
five years, so at this point we almost don't expect anything to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Designating the area as a preservation zone would force property owners and 
developers to seek consent from a special city-sanctioned association before 
altering or demolishing buildings, some of which date to the 1920s. 
</P>
<P>
 The zone, which would be the eighth such district in the city, would cover 
Miracle Mile South, bounded by Detroit Street on the east, Hauser Boulevard on 
the west, 3rd Street on the north and Wilshire Boulevard on the south. (A 
separate zone was approved in 1990 to cover Miracle Mile North, which is north 
of 3rd Street, south of Beverly Boulevard, west of La Brea Avenue and east of 
Gardner Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Such a zone for Miracle Mile South was first proposed by Council President 
John Ferraro, who represents the area, in 1986. It was referred to the Cultural 
Heritage Commission, which completed an architectural survey of the buildings 
in 1988 and finally endorsed the idea and forwarded it to the Planning 
Department last year. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents, principally landlords and developers who say the zone would 
lower property values and add another layer of bureaucracy, questioned whether 
the commission followed proper procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 According to city law, the commission has 45 days after proposing a 
preservation zone to deliver an architectural survey of the neighborhood along 
with an endorsement to the Planning Department. The commission did not do so, 
however, until seven years after the zone was proposed and five years after the 
survey was completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "(It) is clear that the matter was not acted upon in a timely manner by the 
Cultural Heritage Commission," planning examiner Bob Rogers wrote the 
commission last month in a letter recently obtained by The Times. City planners 
have returned the matter to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 Commission officials last week were at a loss to explain the delay in turning 
over their findings to the Planning Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one was aware of any time limit," said commission spokeswoman Nancy 
Fernandez. "(But) I'm sure there's some ordinance somewhere." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding Rogers' assessment, she said: "It depends on what you think is a 
timely manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Rogers also raised doubts about the 1988 survey, indicating that the project 
that studied half-century-old buildings might need "an update" now, although he 
did not elaborate. Rogers did not return phone calls for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's insane," Robb said of the possible need for a new survey. "That's like 
saying we have to review the Mona Lisa to make sure it's still art." 
</P>
<P>
 Opponents, such as Linda Scheid, president of the Miracle Mile Apartment & 
Commercial Owners Assn., said extensive redevelopment during the mid- to 
late-1980s has made the preservation zone irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "This area has already been compromised; it's been redeveloped by almost 50%," 
she said.

THEATER; GARDEN THEATER BLOSSOMS IN THE SUMMER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Summer is a busy time at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum. But then, it's 
always a busy time at the Theatricum. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, the Topanga company, whose name is Latin for "garden theater," 
launched its summer repertory season with outdoor amphitheater performances of 
Shakespeare's "Macbeth" and "A Midsummer Night's Dream." Next month, the 
company will perform Philip Littell's new translation of Moliere's "Educated 
Women" and in August it will stage a revival of Tennessee Williams' "The Glass 
Menagerie." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, there's a four-week Summer Teen Shakespeare Seminar and a Youth 
Drama Camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Geer family, headed by Will Geer (whom audiences will remember as Grandpa 
on "The Waltons") formed the nonprofit Theatricum in 1973, presenting free 
outdoor workshops and concerts. In 1978, after Geer's death, his daughter, 
Ellen, coordinated the company's educational programs and established an annual 
summer repertory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't do modern things with lots of rowdy language," said Geer, a mother 
of three who appears in many of the Theatricum's summer productions and also 
teaches acting at UCLA. "We're appealing to families, older people, young 
people. I really like it when families come together to see the work. Although 
last year, yes, I did suggest that young people not see 'A Streetcar Named 
Desire' -- too heady for the emotions." 
</P>
<P>
 Geer has no such trepidation about "Macbeth," in which she will be the 
alternate in the role of Lady Macbeth. "I love it because it's a real theater 
piece," she said. "The story is so perfectly and beautifully told. You don't 
need to alter it for children; I took out maybe 10 minutes. Children have no 
problem with this. You think of what they see on the news -- this play is 
almost storybook compared to what they are exposed to. But whatever we pick, we 
try to make it real approachable, something interesting for today." 
</P>
<P>
 "Macbeth," (which she is directing, along with the Moliere piece), has 
resonance, Geer says, "because of a lack of conscience and caring in people. 
It's about greed and lust for power. The Moliere is fun, our comedy for the 
year; it's about people being conned by a poet, who don't see the faddishness 
and fakery of it. 'The Glass Menagerie' is (centered on) the Depression, a 
family dealing with that whole situation. We're always trying to hit 
contemporary chords. It's why these plays are classics -- and why they last." 
</P>
<P>
 In the summer and winter, the Theatricum also keeps busy with Shakespeare 
seminars (a 90-hour program, held three times a week over five weeks) for 
professional actors and college students -- plus an annual master professionals 
class. 
</P>
<P>
 The Youth Academy holds spring, fall and summer sessions at the Theatricum 
(going indoors in the winter months), in a multifaceted program that includes 
instruction three times a week in fencing, mime, costume and prop design, 
improvisation, music, dance and Shakespeare study. 
</P>
<P>
 The Theatricum's 15-year-old School Days program offers performances and 
workshops with as many as 8,000 children annually -- brought in from Los 
Angeles County public and private elementary, junior high and high schools -- 
and a new outreach program, Classroom Enrichment, in which company members go 
into local schools and help students study and perform plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "The favorite part for me is seeing an 8-year-old on stage, saying the lines, 
having confidence, understanding what he's saying," said actress Susan Angelo, 
director since 1982 of the Theatricum's Academy of Classics. "When they start 
off, so many kids are afraid. To get them excited -- that's why we all do it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Macbeth" plays through Sept. 18; "A Midsummer Night's Dream" will be through 
July 16; "Educated Women," July 2 to Aug. 21, and "The Glass Menagerie," Aug. 
13 to Sept. 18 at the Will Geer Theatricum Botanicum, 1419 N. Topanga Canyon 
Blvd., Topanga. Tickets: $12 general admission; $8.50 seniors citizens, 
students and Actors Equity members; $4 children age s 6 to 12; children under 
5, free. Information: (310) 455-3723.

BRIEFLY; SCHOLARSHIP: VENICE HIGH FRESHMAN AWARDED $12,000 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Venice High School freshman has won a $12,000 college scholarship, one of 
five such scholarships awarded to Los Angeles Unified School District students. 
</P>
<P>
 Le My Hoang was a recipient of the Warren Christopher Scholarship, established 
for Los Angeles Unified School district students. 
</P>
<P>
 The $1.5-million scholarship fund was created last year by O'Melveny & Myers, 
a Los Angeles law firm headed by Christopher until he was appointed secretary 
of state. Christopher is an alumnus of Hollywood High School. 
</P>
<P>
 For each of Hoang's three remaining years of high school, $4,000 will be set 
aside for her college education. If Hoang maintains a cumulative 3.25 
grade-point average, she will receive an additional $4,000 for college.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; YOUTHS LEARN FROM THEIR PEERS ABOUT SEXUAL HEALTH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIN J. AUBRY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Enlightening other teen-agers about sexual health and disease prevention is 
not something Jovan Colbert ever thought he'd be doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to think like most people my age thought -- nothing can affect me," 
said the 18-year-old Dorsey High School senior and a recent hire at T.H.E. 
Clinic's teen facility. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the fact of the matter is, teens are sexually active, and they don't know 
all the risks involved." 
</P>
<P>
 That pragmatic approach to sex education is what drove T.H.E. director Sylvia 
Drew Ivie to open a clinic for, about and run entirely by teen-agers. The 
clinic, which opened last week, operates on Ivie's belief that teen-agers 
communicate best with their peers.  
</P>
<P>
 "Often, teens are too shy to discuss things with the regular nurses," said 
Ivie, whose main clinic specializes in low-cost or free women's health care. 
"When I looked at all the different programs that address teens, I saw that the 
program that worked most was teens doing things themselves. So that's how we 
set it up." 
</P>
<P>
 The teen center is housed in a spacious back wing of the clinic at 3970 Martin 
Luther King Jr. Blvd. What was once an ad hoc conference area is now a waiting 
area, lounge and four individual counseling rooms where teen advocates talk 
privately with clients about everything from pregnancy scares to proper condom 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 The lounge, called "the living room," is a comfortable-looking space filled 
with overstuffed sofas and a monitor that plays informational videos.  
</P>
<P>
 The 14 part-time advocates, trained by the California Regional Family Planning 
Council, also present health workshops at schools, churches and other community 
centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the presentations and skits are sometimes "not taken seriously 
enough" by young audiences, advocate Carlton Stubbs says, the message that he 
and his co-workers bring is no laughing matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I learned a lot about how AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases 
spread, and I was surprised that it's growing fastest among teen-agers," said 
Stubbs, of Ladera Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 "You always think about somebody older getting it and dying. It's important 
that our (black) community knows this information." 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem faced by the clinic was a reluctance by teen-agers, especially 
boys, to admit that they need help. Clinic director Auleria Eakins, 20, said 
the addition of male advocates helped, although girls still far outnumber boys 
as clients. 
</P>
<P>
 "The boys believe that nothing can happen to them -- it's more of a macho 
thing," Eakins said. "They think that going to a clinic makes then look like 
punks, like they don't know everything. But the problem among teen-agers is all 
the same: They lack information." 
</P>
<P>
 Tylar Moore, who became an advocate with the new clinic after months of 
screening teen-agers at T.H.E., said she hopes the facility will encourage 
young people to come in before they are in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the teens were coming in because of a problem -- not for 
information," said Moore, a 17-year-old Dorsey student who aspires to be a 
neurosurgeon. "But it's better now that we have our own space. We used to take 
people in whatever room was available." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Ivie: "T.H.E. means 'To Help Everyone.' We're trying to do just that."

COMMUNITY NEWS: SANTA MONICA; INITIATIVE DRIVE URGES CRACKDOWN ON PANHANDLERS

<P>
 A group of Santa Monica residents is seeking to place a public safety 
initiative on the November ballot that includes provisions to crack down on 
aggressive panhandling and close the parks earlier at night. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure is being sponsored by a group that calls itself Citizens for Safe 
Parks and Streets. Leaders of the petition drive include the president of the 
Santa Monica Police Officers Assn., Steven Brackett, Sunset Park activist Jean 
Sedillos and Los Angeles prosecutor Ruth Ebner. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the initiative would require beggars to stay at least 
three feet from the people they approach for money and to refrain from 
panhandling near bank automated teller machines or in public parking garages.

COMMUNITY NEWS: CRENSHAW; 10,000 ATTEND JUNETEENTH CELEBRATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a true family event that had something for everyone, from wandering 
clowns doing quick-hit face paintings for delighted children to grocery 
giveaways for their parents. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebratory spirit of Juneteenth, which observes the mid-June day that 
blacks in Texas got the word that slavery was over, was in full force last 
weekend at Cal State Dominguez Hills.  
</P>
<P>
 The fund-raiser -- the largest Juneteenth celebration in the Los Angeles area 
-- generated more than $15,000 for the Crenshaw-based organization Great 
Beginnings for Black Babies. 
</P>
<P>
 The carnival-like celebration was held at the velodrome on the campus. For $2 
admission, more than 10,000 people were treated to live jazz and blues 
performances, face paintings, storytelling, rodeo events and grocery giveaways. 
</P>
<P>
 Vendors sold an array of goods, including Southern food, gift baskets, 
literature, clothing and African American artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The event was sponsored by Food 4 Less, which owns Boys, Viva Food 4 Less and 
Alpha Beta markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Event spokeswoman Penny Owodunni said that the company wanted to stage a 
Juneteenth celebration that gave something back to the South-Central community 
that supports so many of its stores. Instead of stuffed animals, carnival and 
game booths gave away toothpaste, soap powder, cereal and other groceries to 
winners. 
</P>
<P>
 Owodunni said that although Food 4 Less has sponsored two similar events in 
past years, this was the first to benefit a local organization, and the 
biggest. Celebrities such as Hal Williams of the television show "227," Kene 
Holliday of "Matlock" and stage actor Dick Anthony Williams dropped by to lend 
support for the cause.  
</P>
<P>
 Great Beginnings for Black Babies, located in the Crenshaw Square shopping 
center on Crenshaw Boulevard, is a nonprofit group that raises public awareness 
about prenatal health through media and ad campaigns. It is running a billboard 
campaign primarily in black communities that warns against the dangers of 
drinking during pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a cause we truly believe in," said Food 4 Less spokesman Darius 
Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson added that the Juneteenth holiday seemed a natural context for the 
benefit: "It gave us a good opportunity to highlight the culture of the 
community, and at the same time get involved in a great cause." ERIN J. AUBRY

WESTSIDE COVER STORY; DRIVEN TO LEARN; MINORITY STUDENTS ENDURE LONG DAYS TO BE 
BUSED TO WESTSIDE SCHOOLS, BUT SOMETIMES THEY GET BLAMED FOR CAMPUS PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 When he was at Carver Junior High in South-Central Los Angeles, ditching class 
was a part of his weekly routine, said Fernan do Silva. "At Carver, I got 
fails. The teachers let the kids walk out of the classrooms. They didn't pay 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 But now that he is bused to Palisades High, Fernando, 17, finds it harder to 
skip class. "They're a little more strict here," said the 17-year-old 
sophomore, who now likes going to school and is maintaining a B average. He 
also works on "Video Tidelines," the campus cable television program. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't have had this opportunity at Jefferson," he said, referring to the 
high school in South-Central that he might have attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando is one of 26,000 students who each day are bused to Los Angeles 
Unified School District schools in the San Fernando Valley and on the Westside. 
</P>
<P>
 Some have no choice but to ride across town because their neighborhood schools 
are filled to capacity. Others are being sent to new campuses for disciplinary 
or academic reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents send their children to schools such as Palisades High and Paul 
Revere Middle School in Brentwood because of the schools' independent charters 
-- their administrators can bypass the school district's bureaucracy to 
implement innovative instructional methods. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the school district does not keep precise figures, it is believed 
that a significant number of the bused students go to schools in such 
communities as Brentwood, Pacific Palisades, Westwood and West Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The students, predominantly blacks, Latinos and Asians, who make the 
cross-town haul have helped diversify Westside schools and enabled many 
suburban campuses faced with declining local enrollments to stay open. 
</P>
<P>
 But the district's $39-million busing programs are a cause of concern for some 
Westside residents, who blame inner-city students for violence on campus and 
graffiti on the walls of neighborhood schools. It's an allegation hotly 
contested by administrators and the bused-in students themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Busing to the suburbs began in the late 1960s when the school district 
launched a controversial voluntary busing program to integrate Los Angeles 
schools. About 9,700 students from minority areas are now bused to Valley and 
Westside schools as part of various voluntary integration programs. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional 16,000 students -- including 7,600 elementary school children -- 
are forced to travel to other campuses because their neighborhood schools in 
areas such as Pico-Union, South Gate and Huntington Park are overcrowded. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of magnet-school and special-education students also ride the bus, 
and regular school transfer permits are given to other students who can find 
their own transportation to schools outside their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the number of bused students has declined as the district's 
total enrollment has dropped and new schools have been built in areas that were 
overcrowded. Three years ago, for instance, more than 38,000 students were 
bused for integration and overcrowding reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 But cross-town busing is still a ubiquitous part of the 640,000-student school 
district, essentially blurring racial distinctions between suburban and 
inner-city schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea of a neighborhood school is a thing of the past," said Don Savarese, 
an assistant principal at Palisades High School. Out of 1,680 students at the 
school, 1,176 are bused from South-Central and East Los Angeles. About 80 
students are bused in from Topanga Canyon. Some of his students, Savarese 
added, have never attended a neighborhood school. 
</P>
<P>
 A graying population and high housing prices that limit the number of young 
families who can afford to live in Pacific Palisades contributed to low 
enrollment at Palisades High during the 1980s. Now, because of busing and the 
attraction of its charter program, Palisades is near capacity. This fall, a 
math and science magnet program will be implemented at Palisades, heightening 
the school's popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's demographics have also changed. "Seventy percent of the students 
are minorities, and 30% are Anglo," Savarese said. "Ten years ago, it was the 
other way around." 
</P>
<P>
 Rising before dawn and riding the bus up to three hours a day is a grueling 
sacrifice many students are willing to make because, they say, suburban schools 
are safer and academically more challenging than those in their own 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Until a few months ago, when he got a car, Mario Elias would wake up at 5:30 
a.m. to hurry to the bus stop for the hourlong trek to the Westside from 
South-Central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Elias, a junior at Palisades High who had been bused since first grade, said 
he misses the 50-mile round-trip bus ride, which allowed him to catch up on 
sleep, get in some last-minute studying or play with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was my parents' idea to bus me to Palisades Elementary," said Elias, 18. 
An honor student who works on the school newspaper and radio station and runs 
track, Elias said he'd probably be in gangs if he had attended the schools in 
his neighborhood, which are too crowded. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had gone to my home schools, who knows where I'd be now?" 
</P>
<P>
 Yet cross-town busing has taken its toll on others. Absences are frequent 
among students who ride the bus, and teachers say many of them appear sluggish 
and tired in class. Travel also makes it difficult for the students to 
participate in extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 And there has been tension among students on campus. Those who are bused in 
say schoolmates who live in communities such as Brentwood or Pacific Palisades 
blame them for some of the problems at school, such as fights, graffiti and 
classroom disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have friends who said they want to go to private schools because they think 
there are a lot of gangsters here," said Araceli Gandara, an eighth-grader at 
Revere who is bused to Brentwood from South-Central. Out of 981 students 
attending Revere, 550, or 56%, of the students are bused from South-Central or 
East Los Angeles. Revere has a magnet program for gifted students and is also a 
charter school. 
</P>
<P>
 Chad Payton, a senior at Palisades High who lives in Pacific Palisades, agreed 
with Araceli's assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people feel that there are more gangs because of busing," said Payton, 
18. Glancing around the grassy campus courtyard during a break, where students 
seemed to cluster in groups according to ethnicity, Payton added, "But white 
people cause their own share of problems too." 
</P>
<P>
 Eduardo Caceres, a 10th-grader at Palisades High, dislikes the racial tensions 
brewing at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's always some kind of racial conflict," said Caceres, who is bused from 
East Los Angeles. "Last year, there was a big fight between blacks and Latinos 
that lasted three days." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said the warring factions later ironed out their differences. 
Meanwhile, a Human Relations Council was formed, made up of some of the 
students involved in the fight and student leaders, to resolve conflicts and 
foster understanding among the ethnic groups on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials say graffiti has always been around, some local residents 
say it has increased in the last few years, and they blame the bused-in 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Accusations were made by a (few) in the community that it came from kids who 
didn't live in the community," said Pam Bruns, a teacher at Palisades High who 
also advises the school's newspaper staff and media center. 
</P>
<P>
 To let local residents see for themselves that the students are trying to 
contribute to the community, not harm it, the school has arranged tours and 
invited volunteers to help out, for instance, in the school's media center. 
Bruns said the response has been disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 Through campus organizations such as the Latino Awareness Club and the Human 
Relations Council, "we are trying to bridge barriers," she said. "It takes 
work, and, of course, there are kids who are uncomfortable with other races, 
but at least they have an opportunity to work on it and be together. I wish 
more people in the community had this same opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 Some students, however, still blame busing for tarnishing the image of the 
campus. "I don't mind the students being bused in, because it doesn't really 
make a difference to me," said Negin Brokhim, a junior at University High 
School in West Los Angeles who lives near the school. "But sometimes I see 
people getting busted for drugs or something, and then I see them getting on 
the bus after school. That's when I think that they shouldn't have busing." 
</P>
<P>
 Damian-Jason Young, a University High senior who is bused from West Adams, 
said the misdeeds of a few should not spoil the reputation of all traveling 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame people for thinking bused students cause trouble, because some 
kids who are bused don't take pride in our school," he said. "They trash the 
school and cause trouble because they know they'll just leave after school. But 
that's not like me. I take a lot of pride in my school." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who are bused reflect a range of academic ability. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, the better students opt to be bused to a school outside of their 
area. They want to come to schools like Palisades for the educational 
opportunities, and because they feel it's safer," said Assistant Principal 
Savarese. 
</P>
<P>
 Some officials from schools in South-Central Los Angeles believe that the most 
academically talented students are being lured away to schools like Palisades 
High by the magnet and charter programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Willard Love, an assistant principal at Jefferson High School, said there is a 
"disproportionate number" of talented students who transfer from his crowded 
school to Westside campuses. "Any time you lose your top students, it's 
disappointing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Modesta Bassity, a student integration coordinator for Los Angeles Unified, 
said some South-Central parents simply perceive Westside schools as being 
better, a contention vigorously debated in the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are schools in South-Central that have wonderful programs, and parents 
would fight you tooth and nail if they were told to go to another school," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 In any case, the distance between home and school can create problems for 
students and parents alike. 
</P>
<P>
 Most schools provide transportation for students participating in after-school 
activities. Palisades High offers transportation to parents who wish to attend 
after-school meetings or activities on campus. Yet officials at the school said 
few parents of bused students take advantage of this. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a difficulty in getting parents here," said Kathryn Gentry, an 
assistant principal at Palisades. "They are concerned, but they are tired," she 
added, because of juggling hectic work schedules and taking care of their 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Though many students don't mind the long bus ride, the distance is a big 
concern for many parents, and for some administrators, especially when a child 
is involved in an accident on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day, a child had a badly dislocated finger, and I had a hard time 
contacting someone to pick him up," Gentry said. "Last week, a school 
administrator had to follow an ambulance to UCLA Medical Center because we 
couldn't locate a parent." 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Munoz-Owens, mother of a 10th-grader from South-Central who attends 
Palisades High, said that during the school year her daughter Myeshesia's bus 
has arrived late to the Slauson Avenue bus stop six times. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day, my daughter got home at 8:30 p.m. They stopped the bus because 
someone was smoking marijuana on the bus. But nobody notified parents to let us 
know the bus ran late. I had to make four phone calls, and when I finally 
reached the transportation manager at the school, he said he wasn't aware of 
the incident," Munoz-Owens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Principal Savarese said that given the distances of the bus routes 
and the number of children being transported, along with other problems such as 
mechanical trouble and corralling rowdy students, he is amazed the buses were 
late only six times. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, Munoz-Owens said, the very element she tried to shield her 
daughter from by sending her to Palisades High instead of Crenshaw High has 
become a problem at Palisades. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of those kids who have been kicked out of Crenshaw wind up at Palisades, 
and they're causing all these distractions by writing on the walls, disrupting 
classes, starting fights," she said. She said that Palisades, as a charter 
school, should be more selective in whom it allows to enroll. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, other parents and students appreciate busing, in spite of all the 
hassles. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabriel Silva, Fernando's father, said he believes that the Palisades High 
administration is working hard to keep the campus safe. Being in a new 
environment, he said, has changed his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "Since he's been going to different schools, he has a different attitude," 
Silva said. "Once he joined the journalism class, he opened his eyes. He's 
helping out with the video center, and he's keeping good grades to play 
football. To see Fernando having these opportunities to learn things he can 
take to college . . . makes me happy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect a lot of good things from him."

SCHOOL: CRENSHAW'S POLICY ON TARDINESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Have the parents of students at Crenshaw High who are protesting the school's 
policy on tardiness and absence considered that such behavior is rude and 
inconsiderate to both the teacher and the other students in the class? ("Angry 
Over Absences," June 5). 
</P>
<P>
 This kind of behavior, if not corrected in high school, is liable to continue 
when the student gets a job -- and it certainly continues (with negative 
effects) if that student goes on to places of higher education. 
</P>
<P>
 As a community college teacher, I can attest to the fact that such conduct is 
widespread. At this level, students who are in school to learn become indignant 
when others casually stroll into class five to 15 minutes late, and interrupt 
with impunity whatever activity is underway. Occasional tardiness or absence is 
understandable, but habitual tardiness or absence should be corrected before 
the young adults come to believe it is acceptable behavior. 
</P>

<P>
 As an educator in the Los Angeles Unified School District, I have plenty of 
experience dealing with tardy students. The litigants described in "Angry Over 
Absences" don't understand the impact that chronically late students have on 
the educational process. Students who arrive 10 or 20 minutes after the 
beginning of class disrupt learning in several ways. When they arrive late to 
class, the students who arrived on time are distracted from the lesson:. I must 
stop teaching and change tardy student' status in my roll book. Eventually, 
I'll have to reiterate material to tardy students covered before their arrival 
which reduces the amount of time I have to present new information to the 
responsible majority of the class. The bottom line: Youngsters lose hours of 
instructional time over the course of an academic school year because of those 
irresponsible students who arrive late. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the parents' attorney (Phillip Higgins) states that "black kids 
are disproportionately suffering" as a result of Crenshaw High School's tardy 
policy. Such policies must be enforced regardless of race or ethnicity and not 
because too many students from a particular group get in trouble. Have Mr. 
Higgins and his clients forgotten that black students are among those losing a 
small piece of their collective education every time a teacher must stop to 
deal with a tardy student? Has he forgotten that young people learn to be 
responsible through the enforcement of rules? Has Mr. Higgins forgotten how 
consequences for failing to comply with rules contributes to personal growth as 
students learn which behaviors are unacceptable? Jacinto Rhines, Alexis Watson 
and Phillip Higgins, may I suggest that you use your energy to fight "real" 
injustice instead of interfering with a school system that is desperately 
trying to educate and socialize your youngsters?

ART: GALLERY OWNER REPLIES TO COMMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In response to the letter written by Mae Gabriel-Brax on June 5, 1994, I would 
just like to say that Ms. Gabriel-Brax, who considers herself my competitor, is 
mistaken or misinformed. We have been in business for close to four years and 
hold regularly scheduled exhibits of works by emerging and museum-stature 
artists.Galerie Lakaye participates in prestigious art fairs around the country 
(Art L.A., Chicago International Art Exposition), frequently hosts lectures on 
Haiti and Haitian art, and I often create exhibits for the Los Angeles Cultural 
Affairs Department. 
</P>
<P>
 We do not sell lingerie, jewelry and dishes at Galerie Lakaye. I believe Ms. 
Gabriel-Brax refers to a Christmastime event which I organize with my friends 
every year, when we get together and sell gift items for fun, and hopefully 
profit. I have been doing this for years before even opening the gallery, and 
it has become a much-anticipated event by friends and clients alike (this 
gallery is my home too). 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, I would like to extend my thanks and appreciation to all the friends, 
patrons and art connoisseurs who, in the face of detraction, continue to show 
their support and loyalty to Galerie Lakaye.

SENIORS: LINDA FELDMAN; THERAPY TEAM FINDS WORDS FOR HEALING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LINDA FELDMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One is a 55-year-old Catholic priest and the other is a 79-year-old 
psychologist who was raised by an orthodox rabbi. What they have in common is 
the compassion to heal a damaged and diminished spirit -- and the creativity to 
do so using the words of poets instead of the catch phrases of psychology. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Tom Hedberg and Art Lerner run poetry therapy groups at the Exodus 
Recovery Center, a treatment unit for alcohol- and chemical-dependent patients 
at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital in Marina del Rey. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, they have three Ph.Ds and seven master's degrees. Over a meal at 
Nate and Al's in Beverly Hills, where Hedberg ate potato pancakes with sour 
cream and apple sauce and Lerner was urging him to order kasha varniskas, they 
discussed Jung, St. Augustine, Norman Corwin and Martin Buber. They quote Emily 
Dickinson, Archibald MacLeish, Langston Hughes and Dante the way the rest of us 
mortals cite entertainment or sports trivia. 
</P>
<P>
 The two men met at Daniel Freeman in 1992, when Lerner was leading a poetry 
therapy group. Lerner found a way to combine the two loves of his life -- 
poetry and psychology -- and in the process created a way to touch people. 
</P>
<P>
 He's one of the innovators in the emerging poetry therapy field and has 
several books to his credit, the latest being "Poetry in the Therapeutic 
Experience." He's also a published poet. 
</P>
<P>
 Of Hedberg, who came to Daniel Freeman as a counselor, Lerner said: "I found a 
mensch (authentic person), someone with compassion who was a man first. I 
didn't even know he was a priest until we started working together to expand 
the program." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedberg, a former football player and boxer at Santa Clara University, had 
worked with gangs in East Los Angeles, using music as a vehicle to get 
disturbed youngsters to express emotions. Although he loved poetry, he never 
imagined that it could be used therapeutically until he watched Lerner work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found a double mensch, " Hedberg said, "someone who believes, as I do, that 
life is a mystery to live, not a problem to solve. Someone who understood at a 
deep level that people have to live with themselves, others and a higher power. 
I am not a poet, though, and so he became my teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 Poetry, Lerner says, provides insights into the human condition. With proper 
application by someone with a clinical background, it can provide patients with 
insights into their own condition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Man is capable of doing evil but has a need to be better, which he doesn't 
always understand," he said. "Sometimes, in order to resolve something, he 
makes a mistake and gives up integrity in the process. This creates a 
disturbance." 
</P>
<P>
 Hedberg picks up the point: "We both believe in the soul and spirit of man, 
and poetry really touches that. Look at how Gregorian chants are so popular 
today. St. Augustine said, 'Our hearts are restless until they rest in thee, oh 
God.' I remember a patient who pushed the limits with me, insulted me and was 
irascible with the staff. He wanted miracles. Finally, I said to him: 'Listen, 
I'm not God. I applied for this job.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Lerner remembers one session when he read a line from Langston Hughes: "Feed 
me daddy, and love me too." A young woman in the group pulled a letter from her 
purse. She said it was from her father. In reality, she wrote the letter in 
response to a letter of her own -- as part of a fantasy dialogue she maintained 
with her "father." And Lerner used the material therapeutically. 
</P>
<P>
 Lerner was born in Chicago. His mother died in childbirth, and his father left 
him with maternal grandparents. His grandfather was very old and steeped in the 
Old Testament, constantly questioning the purpose of living. Most of the young 
Lerner's development was hidden from public view. 
</P>
<P>
 Hedberg's father was a builder. From an early age, he remembers being ashamed 
of his father's anti-Semitism. Although he attended a Jesuit university, he did 
not know he was going to become a priest until he was in a near-fatal 
automobile accident and had an out-of-body experience that left him with the 
thought that when he actually did die, he wanted to know he had led a 
purposeful life. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I was born in a Jewish family, I would have been a rabbi," Hedberg said. 
"I was drawn to a scholarly life, one that is intellectual and intense that 
dealt with life-and-death issues. I was influenced early on by the great Jewish 
thinkers like Buber and Heshel." 
</P>
<P>
 After meeting two years ago, Lerner and Hedberg became friends immediately and 
went to seminars and conferences dealing with poetry therapy -- a field, Lerner 
said, that is "composed of diverging experiences and interests." 
</P>
<P>
 Lerner says the ancient Greeks told us that Asclepius, the god of healing, was 
the son of Apollo, god of reason and poetry. So, for him, poetry therapy is not 
a stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David Murphy, medical director of the Exodus Recovery Center, calls Lerner 
a gift and Hedberg a treasure. "Dr. Lerner is the most quoted figure in Europe 
in the field of bringing arts to psychology. Father Hedberg is a remarkable 
priest and counselor for troubled souls. Together they have more degrees than 
teeth. It's a gift to me that they emerged here," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 As for the two men's different religious backgrounds, Murphy says spirituality 
transcends religion. "In order to recover from an addictive disease, a person 
has to enhance their spirituality. And that's what this dynamite duo, this odd 
couple, bring to the principles of recovery -- but through the arts and 
literature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to poet Emily Dickinson, Lerner says: "There's one line of hers that 
stirred something one day. It's "tell the truth until it slants." One person in 
the group responded that you can't tell the truth to people because it hurts. 
So we got into a discussion about who does it hurt. It was a productive day. I 
left the hospital with my horizons expanded." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Hedberg, many people have hurts that are denied, entombed parts 
of themselves. He likens a poetry therapist to an archeologist digging to 
uncover the hurts so that the person can touch them again and understand them.

HOT PROPERTY: 'PEPPER'S' BEAT IS BEVERLY HILLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUTH RYON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Actress ANGIE DICKINSON has purchased the Beverly Hills home of late 
cartoonist Walter Lantz, according to public records. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickinson, who participated in a tribute to late songwriter Sammy Cahn in 
Hollywood earlier this year, played a glamorous but wicked grandmother in 
Oliver Stone's 1993 miniseries "Wild Palms," but she is probably best known for 
her lead role as Sgt. Pepper Anderson in the '70s series "Police Woman" and as 
the steamy star of Brian De Palma's "Dressed to Kill" (1980). 
</P>
<P>
 Now appearing with Uma Thurman and John Hurt in the film "Even Cowgirls Get 
the Blues," Dickinson, 61, caused a stir last November when she walked out on a 
surprise taping of a "This is Your Life" tribute to her, saying that she had 
"great regret" but "just couldn't do the show." 
</P>
<P>
 Lantz, who created Woody Woodpecker and other familiar cartoon characters, 
died in March at the age of 94. His wife, Gracie, provided Woody's voice and 
boisterous laugh in hundreds of cartoons until she died at 88 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lantzes had owned the one-story contemporary home since it was built in 
1966. The house has two bedrooms in nearly 5,000 square feet and a pool. 
</P>
<P>
 Dickinson bought the home for just under its $1.25-million asking price, a 
number of sources have said. 
</P>
<P>
 Academy Award-winning composer BURT BACHARACH'S Malibu home is on the market 
at $3.5 million. Bacharach, 65, decided to sell the home, which he has owned 
for the past four years, because he recently got remarried and wants to move on 
with his life, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Bacharach, who met his current wife, Mary, in Aspen, was previously married to 
singer/interior designer Paula Stewart, actress Angie Dickinson and songwriter 
Carole Bayer Sager. 
</P>
<P>
 Sager teamed with him to win the Academy Award for best song in 1981 for 
"Arthur's Theme." They also won the song-of-the-year Grammy in 1986 for "That's 
What Friends Are For." Bacharach's hit-making collaborators of the '60s, with 
whom he joined forces again last year, are lyricist Hal David and singer Dionne 
Warwick. 
</P>
<P>
 A horse enthusiast, Bacharach owns Soul of the Matter. A leading contender in 
this year's Kentucky Derby, the colt finished fifth in the race last month. 
</P>
<P>
 On the beach side of Malibu, Bacharach's Cape Cod-style home has three 
bedrooms in nearly 4,000 square feet, with orchards and flower gardens 
stretching over its 1.5-acre grounds to the water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We opened up the house to have a view of the ocean," said Beverly Hills 
designer Waldo Fernandez, who recently worked with Bacharach to refurbish the 
home, built in 1978. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez described the home as "country style, with a veranda all around" and 
"a huge window seat in the living room." The home also has a room over the 
garage for guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Carol Rapf of Jim Rapf & Associates, Malibu, has the listing. 
</P>
<P>
 NORA BLACK, who was once married to Errol Flynn and is the mother of two 
daughters by the late actor, has sold her Hollywood Hills home to Polish-born 
actress BEATA POZNIAK, who played Marina Oswald in the 1991 film "JFK." 
</P>
<P>
 Black moved to a West Hollywood condo after selling the home to Pozniak. 
Pozniak, a first-time home buyer, paid $375,000 for the three-bedroom house, 
which Black built 22 years ago, sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Rhoda Paramore of Fred Sands' Hollywood Hills office represented Black in the 
sale, and Grace Sielewicz of Jon Douglas Co.'s Beverly Hills office represented 
Pozniak.

REAL ANSWERS; WHAT IS THE BEST TIME OF YEAR TO BUY OR SELL A HOUSE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since many buyers prefer to move in the spring or summer, generally the market 
starts to heat up as early as February. Families with children are anxious to 
buy so they can move during summer vacation, before the new school year begins. 
</P>
<P>
 "To attract the largest number of potential buyers, put your house on the 
market in late winter or early spring," according to "How to Sell Your House, 
Condo, Co-op" by Amy Sprecher Bly and Robert W. Bly, (Consumer Reports Books: 
Yonkers, N.Y., 1993.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Weather conditions are less of a consideration in California than in other 
parts of the country. Consequently, we tend to see the real estate market here 
pick up as early as February, with the strongest selling season usually lasting 
through May," said Dian Hymer, author of "Buying and Selling a Home in 
California: A Complete Guide," (Chronicle Books: 1994.) 
</P>
<P>
 The market tends to slow down in the summer, Hymer said. July is often the 
slowest month because a strong spring will put pressure on rates and slow down 
the market. Vacations and the distraction of summer activities also contribute 
to the slowdown. However, the market usually picks up again the fall -- making 
it the second-best time of year to list and possibly the best time to buy.

O.C. GRANDFATHER TAKES ROLE OF SINGLE DAD; PARENTHOOD: HE'S AMONG GROWING RANKS 
OF THOSE RAISING CHILDREN OF THEIR TROUBLED OFFSPRING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TAMMERLIN DRUMMOND, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Harold Klein had always planned to retire from his construction job at 55, 
sell the house in Dana Point and spend his golden years tooling around Arizona 
in a mobile home. 
</P>
<P>
 But just two years away from his target date, Klein's plans went up in smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 In April of 1991, his ex-wife died, leaving the burden of raising their 
then-21-month-old grandson, Kevin, squarely on Klein's shoulders. Kevin's 
grandmother had been taking care of the child since he was an infant, because 
the boy's mother -- Klein's daughter -- has been battling long-term drug 
problems and his father's whereabouts are unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what to do. He was in diapers and I had to potty train him," 
says the 54-year-old Klein, who became the child's legal guardian in August, 
1991. "I was calling everybody I could think of for advice." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein is among a growing number of grandparents around the country who are 
stepping in to care for the abandoned offspring of their own, troubled 
children. It is a trend that has been fueled over the last decade by the 
explosion of crack cocaine use and compounded by the spread of of AIDS, 
unwanted teen-age pregnancies, child abuse and high divorce rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the time, the role of surrogate parent is assumed by a single 
grandmother, or a grandmother and grandfather who share the responsibility. 
Klein is among a rare breed of single grandfathers tackling the challenges of 
parenthood. 
</P>
<P>
 For a man who has been married twice but has spent most of his adulthood 
living the single life, the new responsibilities have been nothing short of 
culture shock. 
</P>
<P>
 "It took me a year and a half just to begin to adjust," Klein said. "He needed 
all of my attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Every morning, like clockwork, Klein rises at 4 a.m., kisses his grandson, 
leaves him in the care of a nanny and heads off to his job as a construction 
foreman -- sometimes commuting 1 1/2 hours each way from his home to a work 
site. When Klein gets off work at 2 p.m., it's a mad dash home to shuttle Kevin 
to swim lessons four times a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Early evening finds him squinting at the recipe on a box of Hamburger Helper 
-- trying to prepare dinner by 6:30 so Kevin doesn't go to bed on a full 
stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tell you, my hat's off to single moms," Klein said one recent evening as he 
whipped up the evening meal -- quick and easy Stroganoff with tomatoes and 
cottage cheese. "I don't know how they go to work all day long, then come home 
and cook and clean up." 
</P>
<P>
 There are no firm statistics on the number of grandparents who, like Klein, 
are raising their children's children. But the Grandparent Information Center 
in Washington estimates that 3.2 million children nationwide live with 
grandparents or other relatives. In one-third of these households, neither 
parent is living in the home and the grandparent assumes the role of primary 
care-giver. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine months ago, the American Assn. of Retired Persons opened the Grandparent 
Information Center as a national referral service to assist the increasing 
numbers of older men and women who are raising their grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The center has been deluged with nearly 4,000 calls -- mostly from frantic 
grandparents asking for information about their legal rights as guardians, 
sources of financial assistance, and other services. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, nearly 400 support groups have sprung up around the country 
to help older men and women cope with the emotional toll of bringing up 
children in later life. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein is more fortunate than many. His ex-wife left a $70,000 insurance policy 
to be used for her grandson's care. He also has a live-in nanny who watches 
Kevin during the day and does the cleaning. 
</P>
<P>
 But even with all this going for him, being a father to a 4-year-old boy is an 
unrelenting job that leaves little time or energy for the more relaxing 
pursuits Klein had planned for middle age. 
</P>
<P>
 The hours that Klein once spent lounging around his back-yard spa have given 
way to evening swim lessons, picnics with other grandparents raising their 
grandchildren and socials at the Lutheran church down the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein's life has been so dramatically transformed in the last three years that 
he has little in common with most people his own age. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're all in a different stage of life," he said. "They've got adult 
children or never had children at all, so they're not exactly interested in 
talking about childhood diseases." 
</P>
<P>
 So Klein is usually on his own when it comes to grappling with the challenges 
Kevin presents, which can include hyper-sensitivity. 
</P>
<P>
 One evening last week, Kevin hovered in the doorway of Klein's kitchen, tears 
welling in his eyes, as he sulked over his father's refusal to give him a soft 
drink. Then he disappeared into the living room. Minutes later came a piercing 
wail. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein rushed into the living room, favoring his left hip, which is still stiff 
from recent hip replacement surgery. He found Kevin screaming and holding his 
foot. The child was crying and said he had fallen down a step. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein kissed his grandson's bare foot and returned to the kitchen to finish 
cooking dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He (Kevin) has a big heart but he sure knows how to push my buttons," Klein 
said. "I'm telling you, at this age, it's tough." 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, grandparents have from time to time stepped in to raise their 
grandchildren -- an arrangement that was not uncommon in rural areas and in 
parts of the South. However, the large numbers of grandparents becoming primary 
caretakers of their grandchildren throughout the nation is a departure from the 
past. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we've seen over the past 10 years -- certainly the last five -- is 
different because it is associated mainly with the debilitating effect of crack 
cocaine and other substance abuse," said Renee Woodworth, coordinator of the 
Grandparent Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
 As Klein's experience illustrates, the phenomenon is not limited to the inner 
city, but cuts across race and class lines -- a testament to the fact that 
crack cocaine ravages indiscriminately. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jones, a Newport Beach psychologist, said 100 Orange County families 
belong to his support group for grandparents based in Santa Ana Heights. There 
are about a half a dozen such groups in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 "My office is here in Newport Beach -- a very affluent area," Jones said. 
"This is not just an issue for families who are on the lower end 
socioeconomically. Cocaine is widely popular and has spread pretty much 
throughout the population in general." 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said his 32-year-old daughter was one of the drug's victims. According 
to Klein, she became pregnant with Kevin while living in a crack house in Long 
Beach. Five months into the pregnancy, she got off drugs and stayed clean for 
nearly a year, Klein said. 
</P>
<P>
 But like so many others, Klein said, she again succumbed to cocaine's lure. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein said he never sees his daughter, although he says he has told her that 
when she is truly ready to take control of her life, he will be there for her. 
</P>
<P>
 Klein's daughter has visited Kevin several times at the child's 
great-grandparents' home, Klein said. But no one has told the boy that she is 
his natural mother. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the boy often asks questions about his mother, which sometimes leave 
Klein at a loss for words. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been wondering more and more where she is as he gets older," Klein said. 
"Sometimes, after we've been watching TV he'll say something like, 'I wish my 
mommy could be with me.' It just breaks my heart." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell him, 'Your mom is very sick,' " Klein said. "But he tells all of 
his friends that his mommy has gone to Jesus, even though I try to correct 
him." Klein said Kevin never asks about his biological father. To the 
4-year-old, Klein is "daddy" -- the only father he likely will ever know. 
</P>
<P>
 He frets over how best to instill his grandson with a knowledge of the African 
American part of his heritage in a county where only 2% of the population is 
black. Kevin's mother is white, and his biological father is black. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes he'll ask me, why is my hair like this? Or why is my skin this 
color?" Klein said. "I tell him 'because your father is black.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Just after 8 p.m. Klein tucks Kevin into bed with his doll, Sally. The black 
baby doll was a gift from Klein's 18-year-old stepdaughter, Tracy Schlick. By 
the end of his 16-hour day, Klein said he is so exhausted he can barely face 
the prospect of starting over again the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he says, he has never regretted his decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted a son," he said. "I just didn't know it would be so late in 
life."

WORLD CUP'S PASSION, PRIDE FILL ROSE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONIA NAZARIO and MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Throngs of giddy soccer fans turned the Rose Bowl on Saturday into a sea of 
curly blond wigs, flapping flags and World Cup-mania as the world's most 
popular sporting contest arrived in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The game itself featured the Colombian and Romanian national teams -- but much 
of the action was in the stands and on the streets: wig-wearing people paying 
tribute to the flowing locks of Colombia midfielder Carlos Valderrama; national 
colors painted on faces and flown on flags; drums pounding, horns blowing, 
celebrants hopping in pregame victory dances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian fans greatly outnumbered the Romanians, but New York taxi driver 
Vladimir Moraru, who emigrated from Romania, remarked: "Don't forget that the 
ball is still round for both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Moraru was proven correct as the Romanians defeated the favored Colombian 
team, 3-1. Throughout the hard-fought contest, fans tried to create an 
advantage with their cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hagi! Hagi! Hagi!" the Romanians shouted, chanting the name of their star 
player, Gheorghe Hagi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asprilla! Asprilla! Asprilla!" the Colombians shot back with the name of one 
of their stars, Faustino Asprilla. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of Gov. Pete Wilson, however, prompted a chorus of boos when he 
marched to the center of the field during opening ceremonies. From the moment 
Wilson was introduced, all the way through his three-minute speech, the mostly 
Latino audience jeered him for past comments blaming illegal immigrants for 
many of the state's problems. When Wilson left the field, he faced a sea of 
thumbs-down gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We booed Wilson because he is against all Latinos, not just the illegales ," 
said Marta Ceron, a spectator who is originally from Colombia. "He wants to 
take away all of our rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-minute opening ceremony featured an entrance by Southern Californians 
representing each of the 24 countries competing in the World Cup. Nell Carter 
sang the national anthem while four jets flew overhead and about 100 Marines 
unfurled a huge American flag that covered about one-third of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 As a grand finale, Mike Fox, a member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic soccer team, 
placed the World Cup trophy on a pedestal and it was lifted, like a rocket 
ship, about 20 feet in the air. Meanwhile, the field was filled with children 
in multicolored soccer outfits and adults from across the world, waving the 
flags of their countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the international flair of the day, announcements outside the Rose 
Bowl came in several languages. The message was the same: Welcome to the 
world's largest sporting event -- no weapons allowed inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were bracing for the worst -- patting down fans as they entered and 
searching packages left and right -- but officials reported no major incidents. 
Attendance was a near-capacity 91,856 -- but tickets were readily available at 
face value before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 When the game began, tickets with $75 face value were going for $20. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 145 teams have spent the last year and a half qualifying for the 
quadrennial gathering, regarded as the largest single sporting event in the 
world. The two dozen qualifying teams are playing 52 games in nine cities over 
the next four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Although none of the World Cup games will be played in Orange County, the 
Romanian team has been training at UC Irvine, while the Colombians have trained 
at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Wynalda, who scored the goal for the United States' 1-1 tie with 
Switzerland at Saturday's game in Pontiac, Mich., is a native of Fullerton. The 
U.S. team trains in Mission Viejo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Bowl underwent a $3-million face lift for the games. Today, Sweden 
will meet Cameroon at 4:30 p.m. in Pasadena. On Wednesday, the United States 
will take on Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who entered the stadium Saturday ran the gamut from soccer fanatics to 
those who just wanted to witness opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a soccer fan," acknowledged George Zorapapel, a Romanian emigre who 
now lives in Monrovia. "I just came because this is such an important event and 
I wanted once in my life to see a game like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Zorapapel was the exception. Most were fierce partisans and die-hard soccer 
enthusiasts -- like Francisco Rivera, 31, of Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer -- and Colombia -- pulsed through his veins. 
</P>
<P>
 A blond wig atop his head and the Colombian colors painted on his face, Rivera 
beat on a drum from the nosebleed seats and declared: "I feel like I'm in my 
own country. All my Colombian brothers are here." 
</P>
<P>
 There were Mexicans, Bolivians and a dozen other countrymen too, and they 
joined the revelry even though they did not have a team on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most vocal were from Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading them on was the mascot for the Colombian team, a man dressed in a 
yellow, blue and red bird outfit. He had a soccer ball shaved into the back of 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer gives us a sense of identity and solidarity," he said, flapping his 
wings as firecrackers exploded overhead during the opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanian Danny Taut held one corner of a Gargantuan Romanian flag, trying to 
ignore the Colombians cutting a large hole in the heart of a nearby Romanian 
banner. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Romanians got their revenge at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 When Romania scored its final goal with two minutes left in the game, Ingrid 
Martinez, 25, a Bogota native who lives in Downey, put her head in her lap. "I 
think I'm going to start crying any minute," she said. "Oh my God, this is so 
depressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother, Steve, was already sobbing into his Colombian flag. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Romanians sang as they marched back to their vehicles 
triumphantly. "I'm very happy and I'm proud to be a Romanian," said Petruza 
Florina, 18, one of 250 honor students from Romania who attended the spectacle. 
As soon as time ran out, sheriff's deputies in riot gear stood shoulder to 
shoulder around the field. But neither the victorious fans nor the dejected 
ones attempted to break through. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign hanging near the scoreboard indicated just how serious this game was: 
"Colombia -- I Love You Like My Mother." 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of intensity was tough for some to grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryanne Vecchione of La Habra Heights plays soccer at Cal Poly Pomona and 
shelled out big bucks for her ticket. But she was a little more subdued than 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here today but I won't be here tomorrow," she said. "Father's Day is more 
important than this." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, in Old Town Pasadena, emotions were not quite as intense. Afternoon 
business was down slightly at the trendy shops and restaurants and the talk of 
the day centered on the drama involving an American sports hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the soccer field, though, O.J. Simpson was already old news. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Velez, a 39-year-old electrician who emigrated from Colombia 12 years 
ago, came to Pasadena with 14 friends who play for an amateur soccer club in 
Flushing, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans have other games -- football, basketball," Velez said. "These North 
Americans, they like a lot of action. We have a different philosophy. With 
soccer, it's more tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 For Velez, the game also means national pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our country isn't really powerful but with football, we have power, we can 
win," said Velez, his eyes lighting up. "Our ambassadors are these players. 
Americans think we are a country of vices. But soccer gives us a good name." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the Colombians will reach the finals, Velez put his hands together in 
a prayerful pose and stared at the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I can die in peace," he said.

SIMPSON KIDS COPING WELL, SAY GRANDPARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE and REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 The family of Nicole Brown Simpson said Saturday that her young children are 
demonstrating "the uncanny ability to momentarily set aside life's bitterness 
to enjoy life's goodness" and are coping well with the tragedies of the past 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 In an eloquent statement, the Brown family described the children's efforts to 
deal with their mother's death and their own attempts to begin the slow process 
of recovering from the bizarre string of events that began with Nicole's 
slaying and ended with the arrest of her ex-husband, O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "By no means are things 'normal,' so to speak, but with the immense love and 
support we are all receiving from each other, we will all survive stronger in 
spirit, stronger as people, and stronger as a family," said the statement, 
which also was signed by Jason and Arnelle Simpson, O.J. Simpson's children by 
his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney and Justin Simpson, ages 9 and 6, have spent the last few days at their 
grandparents' home in Monarch Bay following as normal a routine as possible, 
riding bikes, fishing, going to the beach and playing handball, pogs and video 
games with their cousins and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also have been counseled by a family priest, who said he has 
explained the concepts of God, death and heaven during a discussion with them 
at their grandparents' home. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about where Mom had gone and they asked me some things about heaven 
and I tried to answer them," said the Rev. Bruce Lavery, who officiated during 
Nicole Brown Simpson's interment service Thursday at Ascension Cemetery in Lake 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children were very, very aware that something had happened but they acted 
like any children: they would be solemn for a while and then start playing a 
game or playing with their toys again." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Brown family, which started the week with the news that Nicole and a 
male friend had been savagely stabbed to death and that their in-law was the 
chief suspect, then made it through her memorial service, her burial and 
Friday's wild conclusion to the saga, the past few days have taken their toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hanging in there. We're doing OK," said Denise Brown, Nicole Simpson's 
older sister, on Saturday. The week had been devastating, she said, "but we 
have to try to keep our spirits up. We have to keep going because of the 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the presence of Sydney and Justin Simpson have helped comfort their 
relatives in the bleakest of moments last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the cold darkness of the night, our beloved Nicole was taken from us, but 
even from this black void of despair, there have been two bright lights of 
hope, peace and laughter," the family wrote. "Our Nicole has left us two 
beautiful children who have touched us deeply within, helping us to heal our 
wounds of grief and depression." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members are in seclusion in the gated Monarch Bay community in Dana 
Point and neighbors are fiercely protective of their privacy. The television is 
disconnected at times, Lavery said, apparently to protect the children from 
hearing news reports about their mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Brown family -- Louis and Juditha, their daughters Denise, Dominique 
and Tanya and son Rolf -- have been thrust into the spotlight. Those who know 
them best say their closeness, their faith and their memories of Nicole are 
helping to pull them through. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the true shattering of the American dream," said Joseph W. Smith, a 
real estate agent in Monarch Bay who has known the Browns for years. "It's a 
tragedy for a great family, a great athlete and a great athlete's family. We 
live down here in Monarch Bay and we think we're in God's country, but tragedy 
can strike anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the Browns did live the American dream, raising a devoted and 
close-knit family in one of the country's seaside garden spots, giving them the 
best of everything and watching as one of their daughters married one of the 
nation's most popular athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou Brown is a semi-retired real estate investor who once ran O.J. Simpson's 
Hertz Rent A Car franchise at the the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Dana Point. The 
franchise was sold about five years ago, said John Dravinski, the hotel's 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 The family matriarch, German-born Juditha, 63, was a full-time mom, raising 
Rolf, 45, Denise, 36, Nicole, Dominique, 29, and Tanya, 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Brown was born in Frankfurt, Germany, on May 19, 1959, and grew up in 
the Garden Grove neighborhood of Royal Park Estates. The two eldest girls 
attended Rancho Alamitos High School, and both studied German. By the 
mid-1970s, the family had moved to Monarch Bay, where the teen-agers attended 
Dana Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 "The girls were friendly, outgoing and popular," said Eloise Meador, the 
guidance counselor at Rancho at the time. "This all just tears me up. My heart 
goes out to that family. They've been through such turmoil." 
</P>
<P>
 It was at Dana Hills High that Nicole, or "Nick" as she was known, came into 
her own, feted as a homecoming princess in her senior year in 1976, two years 
after her sister Denise was given the same honor. Schoolmates remembered her as 
an attractive and gracious student who made an indelible mark on Dana Hills 
High. 
</P>
<P>
 In her high school yearbook, she revealed dreams of skiing Europe and becoming 
a fashion model. She advised classmates to "be yourself, don't be a phony. . . 
." 
</P>
<P>
 A former teacher at Dana Hills High School described her as a "beautiful girl" 
and "full of life." 
</P>
<P>
 "She definitely came from an advantaged family," said the teacher, who asked 
not to be named. "She wasn't especially active in high school but was very 
popular. She had many, many friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Valdivia, 36, a high school friend, said the young woman's family had 
moved to Monarch Bay during her sophomore year. But he said both Nicole and 
Denise Brown settled in quickly, making friends easily at their new school. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdivia, who took photography and "beach activities" classes with Nicole 
Brown during their junior year, said he saw her again occasionally when both 
were enrolled at Saddleback College in Mission Viejo in 1978, two years after 
they graduated from high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was a really good person, just really down-to-earth," he said. "This is 
just so hard to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after her graduation from high school, the young woman began dating 
O.J. Simpson, one of the nation's top professional football players. In 1985, 
they married and spent seven years together, some of it in the limelight of 
fund-raisers and parties and some of it more darkly, amid allegations of 
Simpson's physical abuse of his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 They owned a beachfront house on Wards Terrace in Laguna Beach and threw 
raucous parties. O.J. would invite young beach-goers to join their gatherings. 
The couple also bought a mansion in Brentwood. Barry Elms, a Laguna Beach real 
estate agent, said the Laguna home was sold about eight months ago for about 
$1.5 million. The neighborhood had its share of celebrities, most notably the 
late Ricky Nelson and Bette Midler. 
</P>
<P>
 John Pentz of Newport Beach, the student body president at Dana Hills High 
School during their senior year, said Nicole Brown's good looks and fame never 
went to her head, even after she married Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was always very friendly, always very sweet," Pentz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judie Manto, who has known the Brown family for 20 years, called Nicole "a 
splendid young woman. She was just what everyone thinks of as the perfect 
California girl. She loved the beach, skiing. She and her sisters were just 
remarkable. They had a good relationship with one another. They adored their 
parents." 
</P>
<P>
 The past week has been made the family even closer, they say. At Thursday's 
funeral service in Brentwood, Juditha Brown eulogized her daughter as "a great 
mom and a great friend." 
</P>
<P>
 Lavery, who has counted the Browns among his congregation for many years, said 
the family was "coping pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the type of people who rally at a time like this," he said. "They're 
very close-knit. They're drawing a lot of support from each other right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The priest visited the Browns' Monarch Bay home on Wednesday, he said, when he 
was asked to counsel the Simpson children and those of other family members 
while the adults attended a viewing of the woman's body at a Laguna Hills 
funeral home. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavery said he gathered the six children around him on the floor, talking to 
them about God, about death and about the funeral and burial services that 
would be held the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Cowlings, the longtime friend of O.J. Simpson's who acted as his driver 
during Friday's freeway odyssey, stayed at the Brown home with the children to 
allow the others, including Simpson, to attend the viewing at the funeral home 
the day before the burial, Lavery said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavery said the children -- particularly Sydney, whom he described as a 
"little mother" -- were trying to comfort one another. "They're supporting each 
other, just as the adults are," said the priest, who also officiated recently 
at the confirmation of Nicole's youngest sister, Tanya, and the first communion 
of one of her nephews. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph O'Connor, a longtime friend of the Browns and Laguna Hills funeral 
director who made the arrangements for the services, said he still cannot 
believe the circumstances of the past six days. "The situation is just so 
overwhelming at this point that all you can do is put it in God's hands." 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writers Leslie Berkman, Rene Lynch, Jeff Brazil and Michael 
Granberry contributed to this report. Brown Family Statement 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a statement Saturday from the Monarch Bay residence of Nicole Brown 
Simpson's family. It is signed by the family and by O.J. Simpson's two grown 
children from his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cold darkness of the night, our beloved Nicole was taken from us, but 
even from this black void of despair, there have been two bright lights of 
hope, peace and laughter. Our Nicole has left us two beautiful children who 
have touched us deeply within, helping us to heal our wounds of grief and 
depression. 
</P>
<P>
 God in His grace has given these children, as He does all children, the 
uncanny ability to momentarily set aside life's bitterness to enjoy life's 
goodness. Although aware of their mother's passing, they have been surrounded 
by caring, nurturing family members and friends who have provided an 
environment which has enabled the healing to begin. 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney and Justin have been playing handball, pogs, video games, and have been 
riding bikes, going to the beach, going fishing, and laughing with their 
cousins and friends. They are also being ministered to by our family's priests. 
</P>
<P>
 By no means are things "normal," so to speak, but with the immense love and 
support we are all receiving from each other, we will all survive stronger in 
spirit, stronger as people, and stronger as a family. 
</P>
<P>
 We thank everyone for their love and concern, and we ask that you please 
continue your prayers for Nicole and our family.

'I'M SORRY FOR PUTTING YOU GUYS OUT'; POLICE: SIMPSON COLLAPSED IN OFFICERS' 
ARMS. DETAILS OF BIZARRE DAY ARE REVEALED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 When it was all over, O.J. Simpson turned to the Los Angeles police officers 
who had talked him into giving up, and he calmly, quietly apologized. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry for putting you guys out," said a drawn and haggard Simpson, whose 
flight from justice transfixed an anxious nation Friday night. "I'm sorry for 
making you do this." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Los Angeles Police Department Special Weapons and Tactics 
officers who brought the pursuit to its successful conclusion at Simpson's 
Brentwood home, Simpson shook a few hands and belatedly turned himself over to 
detectives. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was quite a moment," said Sgt. Charles L. Duke, a senior member of the 
SWAT team and former college football player for the University of Arizona who 
once met Simpson on the gridiron. "Quite an evening." 
</P>
<P>
 As he walked to the waiting police car, Simpson was escorted, at his request, 
by SWAT Officer Pete Weireter, a chiseled 17-year-veteran who spent 50 tense 
minutes talking with Simpson over a cellular phone as helicopters buzzed 
overhead and the world-famous athlete sat alone in his best friend's car, 
cradling two pictures of his family, a rosary and a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson was confused and frightened in those conversations, officers said, but 
eventually agreed to come inside when he was promised that he could use the 
bathroom, have something to drink and call his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 He did, and less than an hour later, Simpson was booked on two counts of 
first-degree murder at Downtown police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, based on interviews with key participants in the apprehension of 
Simpson, is an inside look at the most spectacular pursuit in Los Angeles 
police history. 
</P>
<P>
 The hunt began around noon, when LAPD officers made the shocking discovery 
that Simpson had fled the San Fernando Valley home where he was said to have 
been meeting with his doctors in advance of turning himself in on charges that 
he murdered his ex-wife and a male friend of hers. 
</P>
<P>
 News of Simpson's disappearance rocked the upper reaches of the LAPD, which 
had expected the Hall of Famer to surrender around 11 a.m. at police 
headquarters. Told that their suspect was, as police say, "in the wind," they 
scrambled to contain the damage and to recover their famous fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 The first calls went to local law enforcement agencies -- the Los Angeles 
County Sheriff's Department and neighboring police departments. The U.S. Border 
Patrol was alerted, a warning that had special significance because no one had 
ever taken Simpson's passport from him. Airlines, customs officials, the 
Mexican Judicial Police and other agencies were warned to be on the lookout for 
Simpson and his good friend and former teammate, Al Cowlings, with whom Simpson 
had last been seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Universally, the response was positive, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Very responsive, very cooperative," said Cmdr. David J. Gascon. "The spirit 
of cooperation and support was outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 With officers and agents fanning out across the region, scores of anonymous 
phone calls poured into the LAPD. Callers had tips about property that Simpson 
owned, about places that some people thought he might be headed. Some tips 
seemed better than others. Officers were dispatched to check out ones that 
seemed valid. 
</P>
<P>
 At 2 p.m., the LAPD received a 911 call to respond to the same condominium 
where Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman were brutally 
stabbed to death Sunday night. When they got there, Nicole Simpson's father 
told police that a man identifying himself as Simpson had called at least twice 
and had said he was on his way over to kill himself. 
</P>
<P>
 The sight of grim-faced detectives entering Nicole Simpson's home for the 
second time in less than a week was broadcast live. A few minutes later, police 
emerged to announce that Simpson was not in the house. "This is a false alarm," 
Sgt. Doug Abney told the hundreds of reporters and neighbors who had flocked to 
the street outside the condominium. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next four hours, with the eyes of Southern California peeled for the 
missing athlete, top officials from the LAPD gathered in the cluttered 
third-floor squad room of the department's Robbery-Homicide Division. Phones 
rang off the hook, officials consulted with each other and other agencies, 
detectives who worked the murder case were pressed into service to find a 
missing suspect. The hubbub in the room grew and grew, officials who were 
present said. Gascon described it as "controlled and purposeful chaos." 
</P>
<P>
 An all-points bulletin had been issued for Cowlings' car, a two-door Ford 
Bronco, but hours went by without a sighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, at 6:25 p.m., according to the California Highway Patrol, Chris Thomas 
and Kathy Ferrigno, a young couple on their way to go camping, made what the 
CHP calls the first verified sighting of the car. They got a good, long look at 
the driver, who, they told police, scowled back at them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked at him, you know, and he like stared us down, like he was death," 
Thomas told police, according to a copy of the 911 tape released Saturday by 
the CHP. 
</P>
<P>
 Just minutes later, Orange County Sheriff's Deputy Larry Pool saw a car that 
matched the all-points bulletin. It was heading north on Interstate 5 near the 
El Toro interchange. 
</P>
<P>
 Pool got close enough to read the license plate, a California plate numbered 
3DHY503. When it checked out, the chase was on. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was simply a case of a deputy spotting the suspect vehicle, calling it in 
and doing what he's trained to do," said Lt. Ron Wilkerson of the Orange County 
Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies led the pursuit as it wound its way along the Santa Ana and 
Artesia freeways. Television news crews quickly picked up the chase, following 
every step of it as Cowlings snaked the Bronco through traffic. Before long, 
hundreds of Simpson admirers packed overpasses, waving signs and urging him on. 
</P>
<P>
 For LAPD commanders, the situation grew increasingly difficult to manage as 
the pursuit attracted ever-growing interest. Highway Patrol and the Orange 
County Sheriff's Department were trailing the vehicle, with Simpson reportedly 
in the back seat, holding a gun to his head. News helicopters and police 
helicopters were overhead, and officials worried about the possibility of a 
crash. The gawkers who lined overpasses and roadways created still more 
hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings, meanwhile, called 911 himself, pleading with authorities to back off 
and let Simpson see his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is A.C.," an agitated Cowlings told the 911 dispatcher. "I have O.J. in 
the car. Right now, we're all, we're OK. But you got to tell the police to just 
back off. He's still alive, but he's got a gun to his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just wants to see his mother," Cowlings added. "Let me get back to the 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 Police made no attempt to force the car over but followed close behind, lights 
flashing, as Cowlings piloted the Bronco back to Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase slowly worked its way back over the county line to Los Angeles, and 
that meant handing off sheriff's functions to the LAPD. That, too, required 
coordination, all of it funneled through the 15 to 30 police officers hunkered 
down in the LAPD command center. 
</P>
<P>
 At about 7:15 p.m., Detective Tom Lange, one of the lead investigators in the 
murder investigation, managed to reach Simpson in the car. For the next 40 
minutes or so, Lange talked off and on with Simpson, trying to calm him and 
persuade him not to hurt himself. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a frustrating process. The cellular phone went dead a couple of times, 
and Simpson, who spoke of wanting to see his mother, would hang up 
occasionally. But Lange kept after him, reminding Simpson of friends and family 
who cared about him and depended on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police credited Lange with an exemplary job of cooling off a volatile 
situation, negotiations were handed over to SWAT officers once Simpson and 
Cowlings pulled into Simpson's Brentwood home. There, with a spellbound nation 
watching on live television, the final act of the riveting drama was played 
out. 
</P>
<P>
 SWAT officers had only been at the mansion for about 15 minutes when Cowlings 
and Simpson rolled past the horde of news crews and up the cobblestone 
driveway. That barely gave them time to craft a strategy, and they had little 
idea what to expect. Was Simpson coming home to surrender? Or was he returning 
to die? 
</P>
<P>
 "We had hurry-up offense," said Sgt. Mike Albanese, a SWAT supervisor who 
oversaw the negotiations. "We were moving full speed." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson friend Bob Kardashian was at the house, but police had evacuated 
everyone else -- at least, they thought they had until Simpson's eldest son, 
Jason, came bounding up to the car just as it came to a stop. 
</P>
<P>
 He grabbed at the door handle, and Cowlings roughly pushed him back. The two 
men exchanged words in the driveway, just a few feet away from Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking at each other wondering: 'Can this thing get any crazier?' " 
Albanese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers eventually pulled Simpson's son away from the scene, but Cowlings 
remained angry and frantic. "He's yelling at us that he's (Simpson's) got a 
gun," Albanese said. "He's saying: 'Don't do anything stupid. Get the police 
away.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Police refused to back off and already had decided that under no circumstances 
would Cowlings and Simpson be allowed to leave again in the car. One way or 
another, the long day was going to end in Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, police were reluctant to arrest Cowlings in front of 
Simpson, Albanese said, for fear that the sight of his close friend being taken 
into custody might push Simpson to commit suicide as he was threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, officers coaxed Cowlings indoors and tried to calm him down. After 
about 20 minutes, Cowlings seemed less agitated and, in fact, managed to help 
police through a technological glitch in their negotiations with Simpson. 
Midway through Officer Weireter's discussions with the star, Simpson's cellular 
phone battery died. 
</P>
<P>
 With the helicopters buzzing overhead, it was next to impossible to talk face 
to face -- an approach that SWAT generally avoids in any case, in part because 
it exposes officers to danger if a suspect should decide to go down shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings got the police over that hurdle by delivering Simpson a fresh 
cellular phone. That allowed the talks to continue, and Simpson rushed to 
reassure the officers that he meant them no harm. 
</P>
<P>
 "He made a comment that he had a gun in the car, but he wanted to hurt 
himself," Albanese said. "He didn't want to hurt us." 
</P>
<P>
 Weireter, an experienced negotiator, thanked Simpson for that assurance and 
urged him along, saying that police were glad he meant them no harm but that 
they also wanted to be sure that he came through unhurt. "Our job out there is 
to resolve this peacefully, with no harm to him or to anyone else, regardless 
of what he may or may not have done," Albanese said. 
</P>
<P>
 As they talked, Simpson would cradle the family pictures, sometimes hugging 
them to his chest, other times resting his head on them, Albanese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Simpson agreed to come out of the car unarmed, provided that 
police agreed to three things: He wanted to go to the bathroom, he wanted a 
drink and he wanted to call his mother. Weireter agreed to all three, and a few 
minutes later, Simpson emerged from the car. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Albanese, Simpson first held up one of the family photographs, 
then the second, to show that he was not carrying a gun. He then walked across 
the small space between the car and the house, where he was greeted by the SWAT 
team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He literally collapsed in our arms," Albanese said. "We had to take him and 
put him in a chair. From that point on, it was basically a non-event."

SIMPSON UNDER SUICIDE WATCH AS D.A. MOVES TO INDICT HIM; CRIME: BUT GRAND JURY 
PROCEEDINGS HIT A SNAG AS THE FIRST WITNESS REPORTEDLY DEMANDS IMMUNITY. 
ARRAIGNMENT OF THE FOOTBALL LEGEND IS EXPECTED MONDAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A day after being captured outside his 5,700-square-foot Brentwood estate, 
football legend O.J. Simpson spent Saturday under suicide watch in a 
7-by-9-foot jail cell, where he is being held without bail as prosecutors 
prepare to seek murder indictments from the county grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The 46-year-old Hall of Fame running back, whose bizarre low-speed escapade 
through freeway traffic Friday capped a week of morbid melodrama, is expected 
to be arraigned Monday on charges that he fatally stabbed his ex-wife and her 
male friend in a bloody June 12 attack. 
</P>
<P>
 His attorney, Robert L. Shapiro, who failed earlier to surrender Simpson as 
promised, described his client as distraught and emotionally drained. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was morose. He was exceedingly depressed. And he was in tears," Shapiro 
said outside the Men's Central Jail, where a deputy is on guard to keep Simpson 
from harming himself. "And his words to me were that he apologized to me and to 
everyone else for what he put people through (Friday)." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the day's developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * Prosecutors have convened the Los Angeles County Grand Jury, according to 
sources, who said that the first witness was called Friday. Officials are using 
the closed-door proceedings to avoid the spectacle of a preliminary hearing, 
but they hit a snag after the unidentified witness reportedly refused to 
testify unless granted immunity. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although no decision has been made about seeking the death penalty, Dist. 
Atty. Gil Garcetti said that he may use Simpson's attempted escape as evidence 
of guilt in the brutal slayings of Nicole Brown Simpson, 35, and her friend, 
25-year-old Westside waiter Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 * Los Angeles Police Chief Willie L. Williams said the suggestion that Simpson 
was given special police treatment that afforded him the opportunity to flee 
was "one of the dumbest statements" he had heard. He added that suspects 
frequently have been given the chance to voluntarily surrender: "The difference 
was the world wasn't watching." 
</P>
<P>
 * Simpson's best friend and former teammate, Al Cowlings, who was arrested for 
aiding him during the nationally televised two-hour pursuit, was released early 
Saturday on $250,000 bail. Storming past reporters later in the day outside a 
friend's Pacific Palisades home, Cowlings hurled expletives and snarled: "Don't 
you have no respect?" 
</P>
<P>
 * Several high-powered attorneys acknowledged that they had been approached by 
friends of Simpson to help mount his defense. Cowlings' attorney, Donald M. Re, 
speculated that Simpson's aberrant behavior Friday could be a sign he is 
mentally disturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although the circus-like atmosphere that surrounded Simpson's brief time as 
a fugitive had subsided, sharp emotions continued to swirl. Some feminist 
advocates reacted angrily to the cheering crowds that rooted for Simpson's 
escape, while some African American activists contended that Simpson had been 
unfairly convicted by the mostly white news media. 
</P>
<P>
 * In their first extended remarks since the slaying of their daughter, the 
family of Nicole Brown Simpson issued a statement Saturday, saying that her 
young children have demonstrated "the uncanny ability to momentarily set aside 
life's bitterness to enjoy life's goodness" during the past week of tragedy and 
sadness. 
</P>
<P>
 "By no means are things 'normal,' so to speak, but with the immense love and 
support we are all receiving from each other, we will all survive stronger in 
spirit, stronger as people, and stronger as a family," said the statement, 
which was also signed by Jason and Arnelle Simpson, O.J. Simpson's children 
from his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney and Justin Simpson, ages 9 and 6, have spent the last few days at their 
grandparents' home in Monarch Bay riding bikes, fishing, going to the beach and 
playing handball, POGs and video games with their cousins and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 They also received counseling from a family priest, who said he has explained 
the concepts of God, death and heaven during a discussion with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We talked about where Mom had gone and they asked me some things about heaven 
and I tried to answer them," said the Rev. Bruce Lavery, who officiated at 
their mother's service Thursday at Ascension Cemetery in Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children were very, very aware that something had happened but they acted 
like any children: They would be solemn for a while and then start playing a 
game or playing with their toys again." 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Simpson's older sister, Denise Brown, said the children were doing 
"surprisingly great" in their efforts to cope with the traumas of the week. 
"They're pretty strong," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the former football star was described as fragile. 
</P>
<P>
 About noon, Shapiro and others met for several hours with Simpson in his jail 
cell. After the visit, much of which Simpson reportedly spent talking to a 
psychiatrist, Shapiro underscored his concerns for Simpson's mental state. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did not discuss the case," he said. "Our primary concern now is for his 
mental and emotional welfare." 
</P>
<P>
 Accompanying Shapiro were Simpson's civil lawyer, Leroy Taft, close friend 
Robert Kardashian and attorney Howard Weitzman, a friend of Simpson who had 
represented him in the early stages of the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is distraught. He is upset, and we are very concerned about him," Weitzman 
said of Simpson, who he said was dressed in a jail jumpsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first indication of how prosecutors plan to handle the high-profile 
case, sources told The Times that the district attorney's office had convened 
the grand jury Friday. The first witness they attempted to question, however, 
declined to testify on the grounds that he could incriminate himself, according 
to sources close to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 That sparked heated objections from Deputy Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark, the lead 
prosecutor. A closed hearing was held, after which Superior Court Judge J. 
Stephen Czuleger ruled that the witness was entitled to invoke the 5th 
Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 The witness was scheduled to be called again this week, but it was unclear 
Saturday whether he would testify. His attorney, William Genego, declined to 
comment. Prosecutors could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, the county's top prosecutor, said in a news conference outside 
Parker Center that Simpson would probably be arraigned Monday on the two murder 
charges. He also acknowledged that Friday's outpouring of support for Simpson 
could foreshadow problems in getting a guilty verdict when the former football 
great is brought to trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no doubt that O.J. Simpson -- the persona, the hero of O.J. Simpson 
-- is something that most people don't want to let go of," Garcetti said. "I 
mean this was a man. A beauty. A grace. A talent. He had succeeded. He had been 
through tough times and he had made it, made it big. And he was doing good 
things. Unfortunately, we now have a set of circumstances that change that 
entirely." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti was joined by Williams, who had cut short a trip to Philadelphia to 
fend off criticism that Simpson had managed to escape because he received 
preferential treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had hundreds of people in the city of Los Angeles who have committed 
crimes -- robbery, burglary, assault, rape, shoplifting -- who have surrendered 
. . . people who have surrendered to some of you in the media," Williams said. 
"The difference was the world wasn't watching and if the person didn't show up, 
we went out and got them that afternoon or the next day and no one knew about 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Legal experts said Saturday that Simpson's strange behavior seems to have 
generated a degree of sympathy and could be turned to his advantage. Hoping to 
assemble a high-octane defense team, Simpson's advisers were busy contacting 
some of the region's top legal minds. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those approached was Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., who represents pop star 
Michael Jackson. But Cochran said his close personal relationship with Simpson 
would make it difficult for him to serve as one of his attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know him, I care about him," Cochran said. "I just think the way I feel 
about him would preclude me from giving him the best representation possible. 
It would be like (defending) a member of the family." 
</P>
<P>
 One member of Simpson's legal team, respected forensic scientist Henry Lee, 
reportedly left town Saturday after examining a cut on Simpson's hand. His 
lawyers contend that Simpson cut himself after slamming down a water glass upon 
being informed of his ex-wife's death. Police sources suspect he was slashed 
during the fatal attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, according to the Chinese Daily News, said there was no proof of that. 
"There are some indications -- circumstantial evidence and motive provided by 
the police -- but there is no direct evidence, so the evidence is not 
conclusive," Lee, speaking Chinese, told the paper. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Saturday seemed a lull after the previous day's spectacular events, a 
growing chorus of criticism about the case suggested that it had sparked a 
potentially polarizing debate. 
</P>
<P>
 "This thing is really a complicated mess all of sudden, once you get past the 
chase," said political scientist Raphael Sonenshein, who wrote a recent book on 
race and politics in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the city's African American community, there was widespread concern that 
the sensational, wall-to-wall coverage of the case may have had much to do with 
the fact that the victims were white and Simpson is black. Even before Simpson 
was booked for the murders Friday evening, a few supporters at his Brentwood 
estate and at Parker Center were chanting, "Free O.J.!" 
</P>
<P>
 "People will be watching very closely around the issues of equity and 
fairness," Anthony Thigpen, a South-Central Los Angeles community activist, 
said in an interview Saturday. "There is a certain concern on the part of the 
African American community that there has been almost a persecution of him, and 
his ethnicity has something to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Those worries had been voiced the day before in Minneapolis, where the Rev. 
Jesse Jackson and the president of a national black press organization accused 
Los Angeles police and reporters of mishandling the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's been a trial in the newsrooms before it got to the courtrooms," 
Jackson told reporters at the National Newspaper Publishers Assn. convention. 
"We only hope that justice prevails." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Carl Washington, founder of a South-Central Los Angeles ministers' 
group, told a news conference Saturday that he believes Simpson will receive a 
fair trial and urged young people to "let justice take its course." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, who works with gang members, called on young people to refrain 
from gathering at the courts, police headquarters, or the Simpson estate as 
they have in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 Feminists, meanwhile, were critical of the case for just the opposite reason. 
They complained that the way reports of Simpson's past abuse were handled -- 
especially the 1989 New Year's beating of his wife -- exemplified the short 
shrift society continues to accord women and the issue of domestic violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than being unique, the wealthy football star is distressingly typical 
of battering husbands, said Tammy Bruce, president of the Los Angeles chapter 
of the National Organization for Women. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing O.J. kept saying in the police report was, 'This is private, this 
is family. I can handle this. This is none of your business.' It's an attitude 
that runs through the system," Bruce said. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that Simpson's letter to the public in which he said he felt like a 
battered husband was "classic." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's trying to manipulate us into believing he was the one who was wronged, 
and that the press is battering him, and after all the good he's done for 
everyone, why is this happening to him?" she said. "This is absolutely 
classic." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately after the bodies of his former wife and her friend were 
discovered outside her Brentwood townhouse, suspicion began to focus on the 
famed running back. 
</P>
<P>
 Two bloodstained gloves were recovered, police sources said, one at the scene 
and one at Simpson's home. Bloodstains on the walkway where the bodies were 
found reportedly matched Simpson's blood type -- a fact that did not help 
Simpson's case, although it did not prove the blood was his. On Friday, sources 
reported that drops of blood found inside Simpson's home matched his ex-wife's 
type. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending her funeral Thursday afternoon, Simpson was taken to the San 
Fernando Valley home of a longtime friend, where he was sedated by physicians. 
On Friday morning, he was notified by his lawyer that two murder charges were 
about to be filed and that he was expected to surrender by 11 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Shapiro said his client was not tipped off that police were on the 
way, Simpson seized the opportunity to slip out of the sprawling Encino home 
with Cowlings, sparking a widespread manhunt. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next few hours a phalanx of officers trailed the car while Simpson 
reportedly held a gun to his head. 
</P>
<P>
 The chase ended 60 miles later, on the driveway of Simpson's Brentwood estate. 
Cowlings walked out of the car and surrendered. An hour later, the LAPD Special 
Weapons and Tactics team had coaxed Simpson out. Before being booked, he was 
allowed to call his mother, use the bathroom and have a drink of juice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry for putting you guys out," Simpson told the officers. "I'm sorry 
for making you do this."

WORLD CUP'S PASSION, PRIDE FILL ROSE BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Throngs of giddy soccer fans turned the Rose Bowl on Saturday into a sea of 
curly blond wigs, flapping flags and World Cup-mania as the world's most 
popular sporting contest arrived in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The game itself featured the Colombian and Romanian national teams -- but much 
of the action was in the stands and on the streets: wig-wearing people paying 
tribute to the flowing locks of Colombia midfielder Carlos Valderrama; national 
colors painted on faces and flown on flags; drums pounding, horns blowing, 
celebrants hopping in pregame victory dances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian fans greatly outnumbered the Romanians, but New York taxi driver 
Vladimir Moraru, who emigrated from Romania, remarked: "Don't forget that the 
ball is still round for both sides." 
</P>
<P>
 Moraru was proven correct as the Romanians defeated the favored Colombian 
team, 3-1. Throughout the hard-fought contest, fans tried to create an 
advantage with their cheers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hagi! Hagi! Hagi!" the Romanians shouted, chanting the name of their star 
player, Gheorghe Hagi. 
</P>
<P>
 "Asprilla! Asprilla! Asprilla!" the Colombians shot back with the name of one 
of their stars, Faustino Asprilla. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of Gov. Pete Wilson, however, prompted a chorus of boos when he 
marched to the center of the field during opening ceremonies. From the moment 
Wilson was introduced, all the way through his three-minute speech, the mostly 
Latino audience jeered him for past comments blaming illegal immigrants for 
many of the state's problems. When Wilson left the field, he faced a sea of 
thumbs-down gestures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We booed Wilson because he is against all Latinos, not just the illegales ," 
said Marta Ceron, a spectator who is originally from Colombia. "He wants to 
take away all of our rights." 
</P>
<P>
 The 35-minute opening ceremony featured an entrance by Southern Californians 
representing each of the 24 countries competing in the World Cup. Nell Carter 
sang the national anthem while four jets flew overhead and about 100 Marines 
unfurled a huge American flag that covered about one-third of the field. 
</P>
<P>
 As a grand finale, Mike Fox, a member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic soccer team, 
placed the World Cup trophy on a pedestal and it was lifted, like a rocket 
ship, about 20 feet in the air. Meanwhile, the field was filled with children 
in multicolored soccer outfits and adults from across the world, waving the 
flags of their countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Reflecting the international flair of the day, announcements outside the Rose 
Bowl came in several languages. The message was the same: Welcome to the 
world's largest sporting event -- no weapons allowed inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were bracing for the worst -- patting down fans as they entered and 
searching packages left and right -- but officials reported no major incidents. 
Attendance was a near-capacity 91,856 -- but tickets were readily available at 
face value before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 When the game began, tickets with $75 face value were going for $20. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 145 teams have spent the last year and a half qualifying for the 
quadrennial gathering, regarded as the largest single sporting event in the 
world. The two dozen qualifying teams are playing 52 games in nine cities over 
the next four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Bowl underwent a $3-million face lift for the games. Today, Sweden 
will meet Cameroon at 4:30 p.m. in Pasadena. On Wednesday, the United States 
will take on Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who entered the stadium Saturday ran the gamut from soccer fanatics to 
those who just wanted to witness opening day. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a soccer fan," acknowledged George Zorapapel, a Romanian emigre who 
now lives in Monrovia. "I just came because this is such an important event and 
I wanted once in my life to see a game like this." 
</P>
<P>
 Zorapapel was the exception. Most were fierce partisans and die-hard soccer 
enthusiasts -- like Francisco Rivera, 31, of Bogota. 
</P>
<P>
 Soccer -- and Colombia -- pulsed through his veins. 
</P>
<P>
 A blond wig atop his head and the Colombian colors painted on his face, Rivera 
beat on a drum from the nosebleed seats and declared: "I feel like I'm in my 
own country. All my Colombian brothers are here." 
</P>
<P>
 There were Mexicans, Bolivians and a dozen other countrymen too, and they 
joined the revelry even though they did not have a team on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most vocal ones of all were from Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading them on was the mascot for the Colombian team, a man dressed in a 
yellow, blue and red bird outfit. He had a soccer ball shaved into the back of 
his head. 
</P>
<P>
 "Soccer gives us a sense of identity and solidarity," he said, flapping his 
wings as firecrackers exploded overhead during the opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Romanian Danny Taut held one corner of a Gargantuan Romanian flag, trying to 
ignore the Colombians cutting a large hole in the heart of a nearby Romanian 
banner. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Romanians got their revenge at the end. 
</P>
<P>
 When Romania scored its final goal with two minutes left in the game, Ingrid 
Martinez, 25, a Bogota native who lives in Downey, put her head in her lap. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm going to start crying any minute," she said. "Oh my God, this is 
so depressing." 
</P>
<P>
 Her brother, Steve, was already sobbing into his Colombian flag, his blond wig 
still atop his head. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, Romanians sang as they marched back to their vehicles 
triumphantly. "I'm very happy and I'm proud to be a Romanian," said Petruza 
Florina, 18, one of 250 honor students from Romania who attended the spectacle. 
As soon as time ran out, sheriff's deputies in riot gear stood shoulder to 
shoulder around the field. But neither the victorious fans nor the dejected 
ones attempted to break through. 
</P>
<P>
 A sign hanging near the scoreboard indicated just how serious this game was: 
"Colombia -- I Love You Like My Mother." 
</P>
<P>
 That sort of intensity was tough for some to grasp. 
</P>
<P>
 Maryanne Vecchione of La Habra Heights plays soccer at Cal Poly Pomona and 
shelled out big bucks for her ticket. But she was a little more subdued than 
the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm here today but I won't be here tomorrow," she said. "Father's Day is more 
important than this." 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, in Old Town Pasadena, emotions were not quite as intense. Afternoon 
business was down slightly at the trendy shops and restaurants and the talk of 
the day centered on the drama involving an American sports hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the soccer field, though, O.J. Simpson was already old news. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernando Velez, a 39-year-old electrician who emigrated from Colombia 12 years 
ago, came to Pasadena with 14 friends who play for an amateur soccer club in 
Flushing, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing in the sweltering heat, Velez had yellow paint dripping from his 
eyebrows, mixing with the blue on his ears and the red on the throat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Americans have other games -- football, basketball," Velez said. "These North 
Americans, they like a lot of action. We have a different philosophy. With 
soccer, it's more tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 For Velez, the game also means national pride. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our country isn't really powerful but with football, we have power, we can 
win," said Velez, his eyes lighting up. "Our ambassadors are these players. 
Americans think we are a country of vices. But soccer gives us a good name." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if the Colombians will reach the finals, Velez put his hands together in 
a prayerful pose and stared at the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I can die in peace," he said.

TWO KOREAS AGREE TO FIRST SUMMIT EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD BROWNSTEIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The leaders of North and South Korea tentatively agreed Saturday to an 
unprecedented summit meeting, but the Clinton Administration cautioned that the 
United States will continue to maintain pressure on North Korea to freeze its 
nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 One senior Administration official hailed as a "positive development" the 
reports that South Korean President Kim Young Sam had accepted an offer from 
his North Korean counterpart, Kim Il Sung, to meet. Such a summit would be the 
first between the leaders of the two nations since they were divided into a 
Communist North and a pro-Western South in 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 Former President Jimmy Carter relayed the offer to the South Koreans after 
several days of meetings in the North. Speaking in Seoul, Carter said the North 
Korean leader had told him that he wanted the summit to be arranged without 
"extensive delay." But there was no indication from either country of when such 
a meeting might be held. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter is expected to be in Washington today to brief senior Administration 
officials, including National Security Adviser Anthony Lake, about his trip, 
government sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 While U.S. officials welcomed the prospect of a Korean summit, they said it 
would be premature to abandon efforts to impose U.N. sanctions against North 
Korea as long as it fails to provide verifiable evidence that it is taking no 
further steps toward developing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement released through the White House press office Saturday, the 
Administration said it is continuing to explore sanctions against North Korea. 
But it indicated that Clinton would be willing to reopen broad political talks 
with North Korea if it agrees to freeze all suspect activities at its nuclear 
reactor in Yongbyon. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is an internal logic to this," the official said. "You can continue to 
explore diplomatic channels and dialogue so long as you are sure they are not 
moving forward on their nuclear program. That's why we've laid down such 
precise conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Reiterating its earlier position, the Administration said the United States 
needs evidence that North Korea has stopped refueling its reactor and is not 
reprocessing its spent fuel into weapons-grade plutonium. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not a condition of further talks, the statement said the Administration 
would pursue an accounting of possible previous diversions of nuclear fuel if 
discussions with North Korea resume. A White House official said the United 
States would seek "special inspections" of North Korean nuclear facilities to 
account for fuel that may have been diverted into weapons production. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Carter reported that North Korea's Kim had agreed to freeze his 
nation's nuclear program if the United States reopened talks. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior Administration official said Saturday that the United States would 
now seek to explore through diplomatic channels whether the North Korean 
"freeze" offer meets Clinton's specific conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 In Seoul, Carter continued to criticize the pursuit of U.N. sanctions against 
North Korea -- a posture that has discomfited Administration officials in 
Washington. Carter had said Friday that Clinton would shelve the pursuit of 
sanctions against North Korea while the Administration assessed the offer of a 
freeze. Clinton forcefully repudiated those comments and insisted that the 
effort to secure sanctions would move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, however, Carter again counseled against sanctions, saying they 
would be "counterproductive" and "an insult" to the North Koreans, according to 
wire reports. "This is, in my opinion, something impossible for them to 
accept," Carter said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal for a North-South meeting in Korea drew positive reactions "from 
almost all South Korean political and social groups," the Associated Press 
reported in Seoul.

SIMPSON'S PECULIAR BEHAVIOR COULD AID IN HIS DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HENRY WEINSTEIN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The thorny task of defending O.J. Simpson on charges that he murdered his 
former wife and her friend may have been aided by Simpson's peculiar behavior 
Friday, when he failed to surrender and led police on a two-hour journey from 
his ex-wife's Orange County grave site to his Brentwood home, according to 
legal experts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somehow it seems to have generated a lot of sympathy for him," said Loyola 
University law professor Laurie Levenson. "I don't think the public will hold 
it against him that he took the police on this excursion, and the defense can 
use this bizarre behavior" to its advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Other experts agreed. But they cautioned that it is likely to be at least 
several weeks before it becomes clear whether Simpson will maintain his 
innocence or decide to contend that he was mentally disturbed at the time of 
his ex-wife's slaying. 
</P>
<P>
 "Assuming that the prosecution's forensic evidence tying Mr. Simpson to the 
killings cannot be effectively undermined by defense experts, it is very likely 
that the defense strategy at trial will be to focus on Simpson's mental 
condition at the time of the killings," said UCLA criminal law professor Peter 
Arenella. 
</P>
<P>
 "His irrational behavior Friday may help support psychiatric testimony about 
his confused and disturbed state of mind at the time of the killings," added 
Arenella. This evidence, he said, might be offered to reduce Simpson's 
culpability from murder to manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Arenella noted that California law states that flight can be used as 
evidence of "consciousness of guilt." And Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti has made it 
clear that the prosecution intends to use Friday's events to its advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, after Simpson failed to abide by his prearranged surrender to Los 
Angeles police, his lawyer, Robert Shapiro, released a letter in which Simpson 
proclaimed his innocence. Shapiro has said that Simpson was at his Brentwood 
mansion the night of June 12, when Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman 
were killed at her condominium, two miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 Before making a firm decision on his defense strategy, Shapiro will have to 
find out just how strong the evidence against his client is, according to 
several lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bob has to find out what, if anything, ties O.J. to the crime," said Los 
Angeles criminal defense lawyer Donald M. Re, who is representing Simpson's 
friend Al Cowlings, who has been charged with aiding and abetting Simpson's 
flight on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Re said he does not know the details of the case against Simpson. But he said 
the evidence could include blood samples, gloves found at Simpson's house and 
his wife's condominium, and witnesses' statements, among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 While he awaits that information, lawyers say, Shapiro must deal with all the 
negative publicity the case already has generated. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has to re-establish the presumption of innocence," because his defense is 
off to "a terrible start," according to attorney William Kunstler of New York, 
who has represented many high-profile defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 "The presumption of innocence has been badly damaged," Kunstler said, although 
a poll on ESPN television Saturday reported that 72% of the viewers expressed 
the hope that the former USC and NFL football star is innocent. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunstler said that in many cases a lawyer can try to create a more positive 
image of a client by arguing vigorously that a suspect should be released on 
bail because the person is of good character and not a flight risk. But there 
is not even a dim chance that Simpson would be freed after what happened 
Friday, according to every lawyer The Times interviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Vegas attorney David Chesnoff said Shapiro, at the very least, should 
launch a counteroffensive "to promote the idea that there has been a rush to 
judgment" about Simpson's guilt in the media, based on leaks from the police. 
</P>
<P>
 If Shapiro ultimately decides to make a full-scale defense that Simpson is not 
guilty, then the forensic evidence is likely to be "a major battleground," 
according to Re and others. 
</P>
<P>
 Samples of blood taken from the scene of the crime match Simpson's blood type, 
according to police sources. Those sources also said blood samples taken from 
Simpson's home match the blood type of Nicole Brown Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 However, that is not proof that Simpson was involved, because millions of 
people have those blood types. 
</P>
<P>
 The police are also using DNA tests to attempt to more closely link Simpson to 
the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 If the forensic evidence turns out to be strong, Shapiro is likely to take a 
different approach -- some sort of defense dealing with Simpson's mental state. 
</P>
<P>
 "There may be sufficient extenuating circumstances to mitigate the offense to 
something less than first-degree murder," according to Bradley Brunon, a West 
Los Angeles criminal lawyer who has tried 35 murder cases. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a split of opinion among attorneys about how soon Shapiro must 
decide which course to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the lawyer has a critical decision he has to make right away," said 
Robert J. Hirsh, a Tucson lawyer who is among the nation's most successful in 
using the defense of temporary insanity. 
</P>
<P>
 The longer Simpson maintains his innocence, the more difficult it will be for 
him to later claim that he killed his wife "in the heat of passion" after 
seeing her with another man, or some similar defense, said Hirsh, who in 1982 
successfully represented a man who stabbed his wife 27 times and was acquitted 
on the grounds that he was temporarily insane. That case was described in the 
book, "The Death of a Jewish American Princess." 
</P>
<P>
 Arenella disagreed. "If the defense ultimately turns" on Simpson being 
mentally disturbed, "then all of his protestations of innocence can be viewed 
as the tragic attempt of a man to deny to himself the horrible act he has 
perpetrated," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Viewed from that perspective, his lawyer's statements to the media that 
Simpson was home at the time of the crime is simply taking his client at his 
word," Arenella added. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Shapiro launches a mental-state defense, Simpson's entire life becomes 
an open book, "everything is fair game," said Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., a Los 
Angeles lawyer. Cochran said rumors that he would join Simpson's defense team 
were unfounded. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of that open book would be whatever Simpson said in a 3 1/2-hour 
interview with police last week. Sources said that Simpson's first lawyer, 
Howard Weitzman, advised Simpson not to speak to the police, but his advice was 
not heeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Cristina Arguedas, an Emeryville criminal defense lawyer, said that one 
problem with making a mental defense is that a second victim allegedly was 
killed by Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Shapiro would have to argue "that the actions against the second 
victim would be swept up in the heat of passion. It's like one act with two 
victims." 
</P>
<P>
 Another problem that Simpson faces stems from the 1989 incident in which he 
beat his wife. Documents released Thursday by the Los Angeles Police 
Department, including the original police reports of the incident, said 
officers found Nicole Brown Simpson cowering in the bushes, bruised and 
bloodied and afraid for her life. 
</P>
<P>
 A veteran prosecutor, speaking anonymously, noted that a 1986 decision of the 
California Court of Appeal said that evidence showing a history of jealousy, 
quarrels or antagonism between the accused and the victim of a violent offense 
can be used in a trial as proof of motive to commit that offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the problems he potentially faces at trial, defense lawyer Shapiro 
has one critical element in his favor, according to several attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps the most significant aspect of this case is that you have O.J. 
Simpson as a defendant," said prominent criminal defense lawyer Barry Tarlow. 
"He is beloved. The public does not want to accept that he committed this 
crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarlow added: "He has led a decent life; he overcame adversity. He is an 
American icon, perhaps deservedly so. He is the most important asset you have 
in the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Brunon agreed. "Shapiro's client is not only well known, he's well 
liked," he said. "There is not the prejudice that is normally associated with 
someone who is accused of a shocking offense. Also Mr. Simpson is articulate 
and personable and will be able to present his side of the case in an effective 
manner if he chooses to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Levenson said that because Simpson is so popular, the prosecutors will 
have to take some additional steps if they are going to prevail. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are different approaches the prosecution can take," Levenson said. "One 
is trying to convince the jury that there are two O.J.s -- one who is the 
popular figure scoring touchdowns and selling rental cars, and another who has 
a very unpredictable and violent side. The public is just now learning about 
that from the 1989 (wife-beating) conviction and the allegations tying him to 
this case." 
</P>
<P>
 Levenson said that thus far there has been considerable focus in the media 
about Simpson and his shattered life. "If the prosecution is going to succeed, 
they have to get the focus on the victim and the crime and to say no one is 
above the law," she said. "That is what Gil Garcetti did in his press 
conference Friday," when he announced that Simpson was a fugitive. Prosecution, 
Defense Players 
</P>
<P>
 Here is a look at the people expected to play key legal roles in the 
prosecution and defense of O.J. Simpson: 
</P>
<P>
 THE DEFENSE 
</P>
<P>
 * ROBERT L. SHAPIRO 
</P>
<P>
 * Role: Replaced Howard Weitzman as Simpson's lead attorney shortly after 
Simpson was questioned by police. 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: A noted criminal defense counsel to the stars, whose clients 
have included Darryl Strawberry, Tina Sinatra, Johnny Carson, F. Lee Bailey, 
Ivan Nagy, Christian Brando, former Costal Commissioner Mark Nathanson and, 
briefly, Erik Menendez. 
</P>
<P>
 * HENRY C. LEE 
</P>
<P>
 * Role: A world-renowned forensic scientist hired by Shapiro to review 
findings. 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: A native of China and former police captain in Taiwan, Lee is 
director of Connecticut's State Police Forensic Science Laboratory. He has 
investigated more than 5,000 homicides and was retained by lawyers in the 
William Kennedy Smith rape trial. At New York University, he earned a master's 
degree in science and a doctorate in biochemistry. He has assisted 
investigations in all 50 states and about a dozen countries. He testifies at 
about 100 trials a year, and sometimes three trials in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 * DR. MICHAEL BADEN 
</P>
<P>
 * Role: New York State Police pathologist hired by Shapiro to review findings 
of the Los Angeles County coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: Former chief pathologist for New York City, now works for the 
New York State Police as a forensic scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 THE PROSECUTION 
</P>
<P>
 * MARCIA CLARK 
</P>
<P>
 * Role: Lead district attorney assigned to the case, before an arrest was 
made. 
</P>
<P>
 * Background: As deputy district attorney, she prosecuted Albert Lewis and 
Anthony Oliver, who were sentenced to death for the shotgun murders of two 
worshipers inside a church in 1989. Prosecuted Robert Bardo, who stalked "My 
Sister Sam" actress Rebecca Schaeffer and shot her to death. A more recent case 
was the prosecution of two Russian immigrants for the shooting deaths of two of 
their countrymen, whose fingers and thumbs were hacked off after the murder. 
Graduated from UCLA and Southwest University School of Law. Solving the Crime 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are looking at several types of evidence in the slayings of 
Nicole Simpson and Ronald Lyle Goldman. O.J. Simpson, arrested in the slayings, 
maintains that he had nothing to do with the crime. 
</P>
<P>
 THE INVESTIGATION 
</P>
<P>
 Police sources say: 
</P>
<P>
 * Bloodstains at the scene of the crime include samples with a blood type that 
matches Simpson's. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bloodstains in a sink at Simpson's home match the blood type of Nicole 
Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 * A matching pair of gloves, one found at the murder scene and one outside 
Simpson's home, are being examined. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clothing and shoes taken from Simpson's home are being examined for blood 
and to see whether the shoe treads match tracks at the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bloodstains from upholstery from Simpson's Bronco are being examined. 
</P>
<P>
 * A jogger passing through the neighborhood just before the time of the 
killings spotted a car that she said resembles Simpson's Bronco. 
</P>
<P>
 * Interviews with friends and family of Nicole Simpson -- as well as Simpson's 
note to the public -- reveal details about the relationship between the athlete 
and his ex-wife. One key detail: O.J. and Nicole Simpson had recently given up 
the hope of reconciling, which detectives suspect may have been the motive for 
the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 A KEY QUESTION 
</P>
<P>
 How did the murderer or murderers manage to kill Nicole Simpson and Goldman 
without either of them making enough noise to draw the attention of neighbors? 
Police are trying to re-create the crime in detail in order to answer that 
question. 
</P>
<P>
 SIMPSON'S STANCE 
</P>
<P>
 * Simpson's lawyer, Robert Shapiro, says his client was at home waiting for a 
limousine when the murders occurred. Police have interviewed the limousine 
driver, who may be able to prove or disprove that contention. 
</P>
<P>
 * Simpson, in a letter read at a news conference Friday, maintained his 
innocence: "First, everyone understand I had nothing to do with Nicole's 
murder. I loved her, always have, and always will." 
</P>
<P>
 NEXT 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators will continue testing the blood samples for DNA matches. That 
process is far more definitive than blood typing. Prosecutors will present 
their evidence to a grand jury, seeking Simpson's indictment.

 Suppose 50,000 cheering, foot-stomping men show up at Anaheim Stadium not to 
watch the California Angels, but to confide in one another about sexual 
indiscretions, anger at their fathers, or being insensitive to their wives and 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 Suppose they laugh at their male habits -- such as channel surfing with the 
remote control or refusing to ask for directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Then suppose they admit that they are self-absorbed, followed by penitential 
tears and promises to be better husbands, fathers and grandfathers. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Promise Keepers, a burgeoning men's movement rooted deeply in 
evangelical Christianity that is sweeping the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years since its founding by controversial University of Colorado 
football coach Bill McCartney, about 20,000 men have signed pledges committing 
themselves to improve as husbands and fathers. By the end of July, an estimated 
225,000 men will have packed stadiums and sports arenas from the Hoosier Dome 
in Indianapolis to Folsom Stadium in Boulder, Colo. The conference last month 
in Anaheim was the first of six to be held this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The agenda? To strengthen the family and restore the nation by exhorting men 
to become "promise keepers instead of promise breakers." 
</P>
<P>
 Promise Keepers asserts that men, by walking away from their family duties, 
are responsible for much of America's societal dysfunction, which the group's 
leaders say includes high school dropouts, a soaring crime rate, racism, 
divorce, homosexuality and abortion. The women's movement, Promise Keepers 
says, is at least in part a reaction to the pain and abuse women suffer at the 
hands of men. This analysis worries critics, who say that such talk could move 
the group beyond the family to political activism. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers see Promise Keepers as the latest turn in the search for male 
identity in a fast-changing and conflicted society. In American history through 
the 1950s, the family structure was unabashedly patriarchal. The 1960s and 
1970s ushered in the Sensitive Man who acknowledged a feminine side and sought 
to nurture. The 1990s brought the Wild Man, hairy-chested and 
testosterone-driven, extolled in author Robert Bly's bestseller, "Iron John." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Promise Keepers' slogan is: "A man's man is a godly man." In some ways, 
it is a throwback to the days of "Father Knows Best." Dad is still in charge, 
but he's kinder, gentler and a lot more spiritual. 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney said the inspiration for Promise Keepers came in 1990 during a drive 
from Denver to Pueblo. He and a friend were talking about the need for a men's 
ministry. Later, at a luncheon, he noticed that some fathers in the audience 
had invited their sons along. The scene brought to mind a verse (Proverbs 
27:17): "Iron sharpens iron, and one man sharpens another." 
</P>
<P>
 Within weeks, others joined McCartney in brainstorming and prayer. The next 
year Promise Keepers drew 4,200 men to its first conference at the Coors' Event 
Center in Boulder. Now the group has a $3.8-million annual budget and a staff 
of 70 in Boulder. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1996, Promise Keepers hopes that 1 million men will descend on Washington 
-- four times the size of Martin Luther King Jr.'s 1963 civil rights rally 
there. They will kneel in prayer between the Lincoln Memorial and Washington 
Monument to seek forgiveness as men and ask God to restore America. 
</P>
<P>
 "This out here is just the beginning," McCartney said in an interview during 
the Anaheim Stadium conference. "There is an explosion going on in men's 
hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers, mindful of attempts by the religious right to politicize the 
Gos pel, wonder where it all will lead. Promise Keepers' religious tenets could 
put it on a collision course with the women's movement, gay rights advocates 
and those who are suspicious of hidden political agendas. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Promise Keepers is unapologetic in asserting man's role as head 
of the family. It denies that it has a political agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the Anaheim conference, one preacher's remarks were tinged with 
political rhetoric. The Rev. E. V. Hill of Mt. Zion Missionary Baptist Church 
in Los Angeles spoke darkly about the teaching of evolution, the abortion 
"epidemic," and the "satanic" American Civil Liberties Union. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the ACLU threatened to sue the University of Colorado, charging 
that McCartney was injecting his religious beliefs into coaching. The group 
noted that he had assailed homosexuality as ungodly while speaking from a 
university podium. 
</P>
<P>
 The ACLU decided not to sue after university officials made it clear that they 
expected McCartney to keep his religious beliefs out of the locker room. 
</P>
<P>
 "They deny being political and focus, at least in public, on the spiritual," 
said Arthur Kropp, president of People for the American Way, a liberal watchdog 
group in Washington. "But (McCartney) talks about America being in a moral 
decline, that they're engaged in spiritual war, which I suppose is equal to the 
cultural war that Pat Buchanan talks about. . . . I think there is a political 
agenda there." 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Philips, Promise Keepers' president, acknowledges that political 
involvement is possible. But so is serving the poor or working for racial 
reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our focus is changing men's hearts. When they're changed, they change a 
family, and a family can change a community," said Philips, 41, an ordained 
minister who belongs to an evangelical church in Boulder. "A community can 
change a nation." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Lights flood the infield at Anaheim Stadium. It is opening night. 
</P>
<P>
 From the left-field bleachers a shout, reminiscent of a high school cheer, 
goes out: "I love Jesus, yes I do! I love Jesus, how 'bout you?" The mood is 
celebratory and, in the spirit of men, vaguely competitive. From across the 
stadium comes the right field's still louder rejoinder: "We love Jesus, yes we 
do! We love Jesus, how 'bout you?" 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the 50,000 men rise to their feet as the band strikes up a rousing, 
rocking rhythm, "Let the Walls Fall Down!" 
</P>
<P>
 One hundred thousand uplifted hands in perfect synchronization sway like palm 
fronds in the wind. Like a well-tuned engine, they compress the air, exploding 
in rhythmic concussions of clapping that sound like a locomotive barreling down 
the tracks. 
</P>
<P>
 These older men with paunches, middle-aged men with graying temples, young men 
with complexions as fair as the dawn are entering Robert Bly's woods. They are 
singing songs around the campfire. They are beating drums, summoning the wild 
man from within. But this time, Jesus is their guide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Back to back, warrior to warrior; back to back, defending each other, 
standing together, we're building the Kingdom of God," they sing. 
</P>
<P>
 The citadels of male stoicism and self-reliance begin to crack. Men put their 
arms around each other like boyhood pals. Brotherhood is replacing competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Sociologists call it collective effervescence, the point at which one's 
individuality is subsumed into something bigger than oneself. Promise Keepers 
calls it the spirit of Almighty God. 
</P>
<P>
 Loud whoops, applause and whistles end the singing. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon the men will confront their wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Daniel DeLeon of the 4,000-member Templo Calvario in Santa Ana is at 
the podium, sharing a joke about who wears the pants in the family. But the 
underlying issue could not be more serious to those present: the male role. 
</P>
<P>
 Too many men, DeLeon and other preachers declare, have defaulted on their 
responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 The statistics he cites are condemning. Every day, DeLeon says, 2,500 American 
couples file for divorce, and 90 children go to foster homes. Among teen-agers, 
500 turn to drugs, 1,000 turn to alcohol, 1,200 commit suicide and 2,200 drop 
out of school. 
</P>
<P>
 It is time, the men are told, to be fathers and husbands who set the tone for 
their households. 
</P>
<P>
 Promise Keepers insists that gender roles are given by God. One of its books, 
"Seven Promises of a Promise Keeper," enjoins men under the subheading, 
"Reclaiming Your Manhood," to tell their wives: "Honey, I've made a terrible 
mistake. I've given you my role. I gave up leading this family, and I forced 
you to take my place. Now I must reclaim that role. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't misunderstand what I'm saying here," the author cautions. "I'm not 
suggesting that you ask for your role back. I'm urging you to take it back. " 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of emphasis worries the Rev. Ron Benefiel, pastor of the First 
Church of the Nazarene in Los Angeles and a leader in evangelical Christianity. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we hear the world is a mess because men have given up leadership," 
said Benefiel, who was an observer in Anaheim. "That has the seeds of 
discrimination. Instead of race, it's gender." 
</P>
<P>
 He cautioned that Promise Keepers could easily cross the line from encouraging 
male leadership to reinforcing male superiority. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Balswick, director of clinical training in the department of marriage and 
family therapy at Fuller Theological Seminary in Pasadena, shares Benefiel's 
concerns. She would prefer to see men and women work together as "co-parents" 
and share leadership in the home. "We don't want two separate movements again," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she said that for those who believe in a strict male "headship" model, 
Promise Keepers can help by urging men to temper their authority with intimacy, 
tenderness and nurturing. 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney, 52, a former Roman Catholic who now belongs to an evangelical 
church, believes that it has always been in God's plan that the man should be 
the family's spiritual leader. 
</P>
<P>
 He tells the Anaheim conference that between 1950 and 1990, polls showed that 
the home slipped from first to fourth place as the most influential factor in 
the lives of children, behind peer groups, television and schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "My question to you is, why is the home fourth?" McCartney asks. "Could it be 
that there's no one home? Could it be that there's no one home that has lived 
up to their promises?" 
</P>
<P>
 Why men ignore their responsibilities or are emotionally absent from their 
wives and children has been the subject of countless studies. Some argue that 
stoicism, self-absorption and the search for identity are rooted in the 
failings of men's fathers to nurture them. Others say careers take precedence 
over family. 
</P>
<P>
 Talking about fathers is gut-wrenching stuff for many of the men at Anaheim 
Stadium. "What we sense here now is sons who did not have a father, or (a 
father who) was not one to speak and to show us his love," Promise Keepers 
President Philips declares. A hush falls over the stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Taylor later said he could feel the tension around him. "They were 
crying. There was a loss of words. They didn't know what to say," said Taylor, 
25, an elementary school teacher from Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 All forms of the men's movement, whether secular or Christian, point to the 
same thing, said Robert Hicks, a professor of pastoral theology at the Seminary 
of the East in Dresher, Pa. "For the last couple of decades, all has not been 
well with men. There is a deep-seated, almost desperation going on, a male 
hunger, a problem that reflects the father affections and affirmations we 
didn't have as sons being raised," said Hicks, author of "The Masculine 
Journey." 
</P>
<P>
 Promise Keepers doesn't dwell on past grievances or sins, however. It does not 
want men to wallow in self-pity. 
</P>
<P>
 It urges men to acknowledge their wounds -- and broken promises -- repent and, 
with the help of other men, do better by their own sons, daughters and wives. 
</P>
<P>
 This can be a tall order, particularly for men with unresolved life issues. 
McCartney says that men cannot do it by themselves. They need help. 
</P>
<P>
 Promise Keepers asks men to form small groups of confidants who will not only 
regularly listen and offer support and prayer, but hold those in the group 
accountable for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The coach is onstage. It's halftime in the lives of thousands of men all 
around him. This is the pep talk that, with God's help, McCartney hopes will 
lead them to a spiritual victory. 
</P>
<P>
 By his own account, he's "a mess." He has had his share of guilt and pain, 
when he put football ahead of everything else, including his wife and children. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1988, he was devastated by his 19-year-old daughter's announcement that she 
was carrying the baby of the coach's star quarterback, Sal Aunese. He stood by 
his daughter. Later, Aunese was found to have inoperable stomach cancer, and 
McCartney spent hours at his bedside, leading him to accept Christ just days 
before he died. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hope it doesn't take other guys as long as it took me to realize how 
important a father is to his children," the coach told Promise Keepers' 
magazine, New Man, a few years later. 
</P>
<P>
 But McCartney is on home turf now. He is in a stadium, and nearly everyone in 
it is a fan. His voice is thick with emotion. His words are edged with a wisp 
of the penitential. 
</P>
<P>
 "It isn't like we stopped loving our wives," he said. "But they said, 'What 
happened to that guy that had all of his focus on me?' And we went after the 
career. . . . We took our eyes off our loved ones and we took on the challenge 
of the American dream. But guess what? That's not Almighty God's design for us 
at all." 
</P>
<P>
 McCartney has a plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We say: 'Lord, it's not about me. It's about you. Lord, when I walk through 
that door . . . it's not going to be about my appetite. It's not going to be 
about my fatigue. . . . I'm not going to walk in the door and say, 'What's for 
dinner?' 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to walk in the door and I'm gonna say, 'Honey, how are you? ' And 
I'm going to come alongside her and I'm going to see her needs and respond to 
(them)." 
</P>
<P>
 Women such as Connie Schaedel of LaMirada say they notice a difference in 
their mates. Her husband, Granville (Bud) Schaedel, was active in Promise 
Keepers before his death at age 60 in April. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our relationship, our marriage, became even more complete, even more whole, 
as a result of the way he felt he could express himself . . . after the Boulder 
conference," she told reporters. "It was an incredible blessing." 
</P>
<P>
 But what if the women do not respond in kind? McCartney tells the men to be 
patient. Never give up. God will provide.

THE OLD MAN AND THE BOY: A FATHER-SON BOND GROWS; PARENTING: IN KOREATOWN 13 
YEARS AGO, A BLACK MAN FINDS AN ABANDONED BABY. 'ROY IS GOD'S GIFT TO ME,' HE 
SAYS. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In many corners of Los Angeles' Korean community, the old black man and the 
young Korean boy often cause heads to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, they are an odd couple, but that's not the only reason they draw 
looks. 
</P>
<P>
 The love between them is so evident -- the way it is between fathers and sons 
who are very close. They may not have the money to visit Disneyland or 
Universal Studios on a whim, but off they go to Kenneth Hahn Lake in Baldwin 
Hills to fish or to a church picnic in the South Bay, looking happy riding in 
the old man's gray 1985 Dodge Ram pickup. The car radio is tuned to a Christian 
station and the old man can be heard singing "Amazing Grace" as he negotiates 
the snarled traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 For nearly 13 years, Leon T. Graves, 68, has reared Roy Chung, whom he found 
crying and near death as an infant, abandoned by his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roy is God's gift to me," said Graves, who despite his age and ailments, 
prepares Roy's meals, drives him to and from his school, music and martial arts 
classes and Korean church functions. 
</P>
<P>
 The African American and the Korean are inseparable, doing everything 
together. Roy has even taken to unconsciously emulating the posture of Graves, 
who walks slightly stooped because of an old war injury and age. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's walking like an old man," Graves said, shaking his head the other 
evening, watching the boy as he walked ahead on their way to a Koreatown 
restaurant. "Roy, you shouldn't walk like an old man." 
</P>
<P>
 Roy looked back, grinned. Then, picking up his pace, he skipped along, as if 
to dispute the observation about his gait. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the old man and the boy been of the same race, strangers would have 
assumed them to be grandfather and grandson, but the stark contrast in their 
physical appearances is not easily overlooked -- even in multiethnic Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I consider Leon my father," said Roy, who chose him over his mother after he 
was reunited with her several years ago. She gave approval for Graves to become 
Roy's legal guardian through the U.S. Embassy in Seoul in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leon is also my best friend," said the boy, whose own father has refused to 
acknowledge him. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Father's Day, they will attend church, then try to complete their move 
to a new apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The destiny that brought the pair together began in 1981 in an apartment 
building at the edge of Koreatown. Graves was working at a wholesale fish 
market and lived in a four-story building occupied mostly by blacks and 
Koreans. 
</P>
<P>
 One afternoon, a Korean neighbor told him that she and her husband had not 
been able to sleep for two or three nights because of a crying baby next door. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves helped manage the building on the side, so he had a key to the 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 When he opened the door, he saw an infant on the floor, wailing. 
</P>
<P>
 "His eyes were in the back of his head -- he was very sick," Graves recalled. 
"I saw that the baby needed immediate attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Beside him on the floor was the baby's birth certificate. Roy Dae Yon Chung, 
it said. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves took the baby to Childrens Hospital in Los Angeles. Doctors said he 
would not have survived another three hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks later, Graves, who was 55 and single, picked up the baby from the 
hospital. Roy was almost 7 months old. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I brought him home from the hospital, I didn't know what I was going to 
do with him," he said. So he prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I said: 'Lord, what am I going to do with this?' He didn't answer for a long 
time, which meant that I had to continue doing what I was doing. Then, when he 
did answer, he caught me right at the right moment. He told me: 'This burden, 
you take care of.' I've done the best I could." 
</P>
<P>
 Graves hired a Korean woman who lived in the building to look after the baby 
while he was at work. Working at a fish market meant leaving home at 2 a.m. He 
would rush home after work to relieve the baby-sitter. 
</P>
<P>
 After three months of this routine, Graves wondered how long he could 
continue. But when he thought about turning Roy over to foster care, horror 
stories about children in public charge gnawed at him. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a jailhouse. Nobody loves him; nobody wants him. So I said, 'I can't 
do that, Lord.' So I keep on keeping on. I tell you, it was kind of tiresome at 
the beginning, but as he began to get a little older, every time I hit the 
door, he'd be right there, following me. People saw me all over the city with 
him. He'd be riding on my back." 
</P>
<P>
 But nobody knew the real story of the black man and the Korean boy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought in the background I had a Korean woman," Graves said. "They 
never saw her; they just always saw me with Roy and some of them would kind of 
snicker at me in the market, you know. Well, I said, 'they just don't 
understand,' and I'd pay for $20 worth of groceries and just leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Graves stayed close to Koreatown because he wanted Roy to acquire his Korean 
identity. He also learned to prepare Korean food, which he first tasted as a 
soldier during the Korean War, and began to attend a Korean church. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves is the only non-Korean at the Light Mission Church, a fundamentalist 
Protestant congregation whose members treat him with affection and deference. 
They refer to him as Haraboji (grandfather)," a term of respect and endearment 
in Korean culture. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Jeung Bok Song says Graves attends not only the main Sunday morning 
service, but stays for lunch, then an afternoon Bible class as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Song once asked Graves, a former Baptist minister, to give a sermon to a youth 
group. The church paid him a $75 honorarium. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the following Sunday, he put the $75 on the offering plate," Song said. 
"He should have bought himself a pair of shoes he needed, but he didn't. That's 
the kind of man Leon is." 
</P>
<P>
 Though his sermons are in Korean, Song gives Bible citations in English to 
enable Graves to follow. 
</P>
<P>
 Song says the presence of Graves and Roy at his church has been a blessing. 
"Roy has become much more outgoing since he began coming to the church. He 
knows we love him." 
</P>
<P>
 At a recent church picnic, Graves fit right in. When verbal communication fell 
short, smiles, friendly gestures and nods took care of the rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Some older women giggled like girls, not knowing quite how to respond when 
Graves took their hand to his lips to show his appreciation for the fine lunch 
they had served him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jee Hee Min, a church member in her early 50s, said she regrets that she 
cannot tell Graves in English how much she appreciates him. Most people talk 
Christianity, she said, but Graves lives it. 
</P>
<P>
 The partaking of the Korean food with him makes them feel close to him, the 
women said as they ate, seated on mats, at Harbor Regional Park in the South 
Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The peaceful setting of the park by the lake is a long way from "Blood Alley" 
near their apartment at 18th Street and Western Avenue. At minutes after 7 p.m. 
on a Thursday evening, gang members are out in force in the alley. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's Blood Alley, right there," said Graves, from inside his pickup. "They 
killed a man the other day -- in broad daylight." 
</P>
<P>
 That is why they're moving. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy, who had been observing activities in the alley, said: "Leon, did you know 
that there is a lot of gangs on 18th Street?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," the man said. "I don't bother with different gangs and I don't want 
you to get involved. You have a lot of knowledge about it already. And that's 
too much." 
</P>
<P>
 Blood Alley and the gangs may be just around the corner, but their tiny 
cluttered apartment looks homey with old photographs of relatives, knickknacks 
and mementos occupying few available wall spaces. They have been moving bit by 
bit to a one-bedroom apartment north of Wilshire in Koreatown. 
</P>
<P>
 In the clutter, two things stand out: One is a large crucifix and another is a 
prayer for a "special boy," which asks God to keep the child from all harm as 
he grows to be a man. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Anna and Young Joon Shon, owners of a golf shop in Koreatown, first saw Leon 
Graves last September. 
</P>
<P>
 "I kept seeing an old black man going through the garbage can outside our 
store," Young Joon Shon said. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Shons got to know him better, they learned that he was collecting cans 
and bottles to augment his fixed income to raise a Korean child. 
</P>
<P>
 "We assumed that he had a Korean wife, but when he showed up with Roy at the 
store, we were surprised to see a pure Korean kid," Shon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shon wanted to help Graves. But with his business down 90% since the riots, 
the best he could do was to offer him a part-time job for a pittance. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves told Shon that pay did not matter. Thus began their friendship. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we had the means, we would like to have Leon and Roy move in with us," 
Anna Shon said. "They're like members of our family already." 
</P>
<P>
 In April, while her husband was visiting Korea, she and Graves worked side by 
side every day. They ate together and had long talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Anna Shon was gripped by the desire to share the story of Graves and Roy with 
other Koreans. "I felt the Korean community owed him a debt." 
</P>
<P>
 She wrote a letter to the Los Angeles edition of the Korean-language Hankook 
Ilbo newspaper. Reporter Jung In Lee, the mother of two teen-age boys, wrote a 
story under the headline: "Our blood and skin color may be different, but we're 
father and son." A picture of a smiling Graves and Roy with their arms over 
each other's shoulders accompanied her story. It was reprinted in the paper's 
editions in other U.S. cities and in Seoul. Reaction was phenomenal. 
</P>
<P>
 A private Korean school gave Roy a scholarship. A Korean-American dentist 
offered to straighten the boy's teeth. A Koreatown piano store owner gave him a 
keyboard instrument. The Christian Federation of Korean Women in the United 
States honored Graves with its Outstanding Humanitarian award. A Korean 
American apartment manager arranged for a $200 discount on their new apartment 
by contributing $100 a month out of his own pocket. Thus far, they have 
received almost $10,000 in gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nak-Do Children's Support Assn., a women's group helping disadvantaged 
children, got in touch with officers of the Korean Business and Professional 
Women's Assn. of Los Angeles when they visited Seoul. The Namsung Presbyterian 
Church in Seoul invited Graves and Roy for a visit. 
</P>
<P>
 The two Korean institutions teamed up to offer an all-expenses-paid two-week 
trip to Graves, Roy and Anna Shon. They will leave Los Angeles on July 22, in 
time to celebrate Roy's 13th birthday, July 24, in Seoul, and Graves will 
deliver a sermon on his favorite subject, love, at the Korean church. 
</P>
<P>
 A secret to getting along among people of different races and culture, Graves 
said, is love and a willingness to understand. "You just have to get in there 
and get to know them," he said, referring to his close ties with Koreans. "I 
admire the courage of the Korean people. You'll find Koreans to be 
humanitarians." 
</P>
<P>
 Graves, who was injured during the Korean War, is expected to receive a medal 
from the South Korean government too. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inside Shon's business, U.S. Golf of California, Graves answers the phone with 
his rich baritone voice and waits on customers with the ease of a man who has 
worked many jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 At 3 p.m., Graves stops everything and climbs in his pickup to get Roy at his 
school and bring him to the office. Roy does his homework in Shon's office 
until closing time at 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves is pleased that Roy is attending Hankook School, where 80% of students 
are Korean, because of the school's high academic standards. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to become a lawyer," Roy said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, it will be good to become a lawyer and work for the community," Graves 
said approvingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old man lives for Roy," Young Joon Shon said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, Graves married a Korean hoping to find a good mother for Roy, 
but the union ended after three years. She was not good to Roy, Graves said. He 
confided to Anna Shon that his former wife prepared special foods for her 
children, but not for Roy. She did her children's laundry, but not Roy's. 
</P>
<P>
 Graves says he hopes to marry again. But he wonders: "Who's going to marry an 
old geezer with no money?" 
</P>
<P>
 Shon says Graves may lack material possessions, but he considers him a winner. 
"I've met a lot of people during my 27 years in America, including many pastors 
and priests. Leon is the first man I met who lives Christ-like." 
</P>
<P>
 When Graves and Roy were dining in a popular Koreatown restaurant the other 
evening, people came to his table to thank Graves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please tell him I respect him," a Korean waiter told Graves' dinner companion 
in Korean. Then the waiter made a deep bow to the old man and walked away.

MINORITIES, WOMEN GAIN IN STATE RACES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Remember that three-way Democratic contest for secretary of state? 
</P>
<P>
 If you looked closely, you could see the California of the 21st Century in its 
top contenders, among them a gay man, an Asian man and a black woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there had only been a Latino (as a major party candidate) in the race, 
it'd been perfect," said political analyst Sherry Bebitch Jeffe. "It is the 
constituency of the future." 
</P>
<P>
 The Californians who cast ballots in the primary election -- the few, the 
proud, the high-propensity voters -- were predominantly white, prosperous, 
older and, among Republicans, male. But, in dozens of races, statewide and 
otherwise, they sent into the November election many candidates who are women, 
minorities and gays. 
</P>
<P>
 Together, this month's primary winners may rack up as many firsts in November 
as the old East German Olympic team. California could have: 
</P>
<P>
 * The first Latino statewide officer in 120 years, if Democrat Art Torres is 
elected insurance commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 * The first openly homosexual constitutional officer, in Democratic acting 
Secretary of State Tony Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 * The first woman lieutenant governor, in Republican state Sen. Cathie Wright. 
</P>
<P>
 * The first Latina state senator, if Democrat Hilda Solis moves up from the 
Assembly in the predominantly Democratic 24th District. 
</P>
<P>
 * The first openly gay legislator, if Sheila Kuehl is elected in the 41st 
Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 Women bulk up the top of the Democratic ticket: Kathleen Brown for governor, 
Dianne Feinstein for Senate and Kathleen Connell for controller. 
</P>
<P>
 And the nonpartisan race for superintendent of public instruction sends former 
Democratic Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin and Gov. Pete Wilson's secretary for 
child development and education, Maureen DiMarco, into a November runoff. 
</P>
<P>
 In the legislative contests, term limits have blown open the doors to both 
houses. Women ran in major party primaries for 15 of 22 open Assembly seats, 
winning eight (six are favorites to win in November). Women also ran in three 
of four open Senate seats, taking two. Only Solis is expected to win this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Katherine Spillar, who heads the Fund for the Feminist Majority, which charted 
this year's races, sees a steady climb from 1992, the "Year of the Woman." 
</P>
<P>
 "The significance of women winning this year, running key primary races in 
open seats, no longer (being) throwaway candidates -- I think what we saw was a 
precursor to 1996, and the massive turnover in the Assembly," Spillar said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as these groups are celebrating, they are also striving for ways to 
appeal to all voters. 
</P>
<P>
 The key for a woman or minority candidate is "crossover," said Harry Pachon, 
president of the Tomas Rivera Center at Claremont Colleges. "Here in 
California, nearly half of all elected Latino officials do not have 
Latino-majority districts. You have to (make your priorities) to be an elected 
official first, and then a Latino second, or a woman second, or whatever." 
</P>
<P>
 Each constituency has its distinctions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Beginning in the 1980s, the gender gap helped to tip the balance to women 
among registered Democrats, who the Los Angeles Times Poll found now hold a 58% 
to 42% numerical advantage over men. 
</P>
<P>
 * UCLA political science professor John Petrocik contrasts the low voter 
turnout in Latino communities with popular Latino candidates who have fared 
well -- "elites without a well-developed constituency. They're there by virtue 
of their own energy and ambition, not a real (Latino political) apparatus." 
</P>
<P>
 * Rand Martin, chief of staff to Assemblyman John Vasconcellos (D-Santa 
Clara), has worked on campaigns of several gay candidates and believes that 
they should "campaign on the broadest base they possibly can, never ignoring or 
apologizing for the fact they're gay or lesbian. . . . But I don't think any 
politician does very well as a single-issue politician." 
</P>
<P>
 As early as 1990, women and minority candidates began to look formidable, and 
opponents' campaigns began to change because of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Campaigns and Elections magazine that year suggested techniques for running 
against women or minorities, among them: "Accent the negative predispositions 
voters have about women or black politicians by emphasizing your candidate's 
qualifications and depicting him or her in demanding situations requiring cool 
judgment. . . . Emphasize 'macho' middle-class issues" such as crime and free 
enterprise, or take the "offer-your-handkerchief" tone, saying "something 
soothingly paternalistic to suggest they have lost composure." 
</P>
<P>
 But the assumption of a constant, hidden anti-woman, anti-minority vote may 
have been overtaken recently by the anti-incumbent vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanto Iyengar, a professor of communications and political science at UCLA, 
said: "In general there's such a bad taste in most people's mouths with 
politics and incumbents, my own opinion is that it would be a plus to be 
considered different." 
</P>
<P>
 Times Poll director John Brennan said results of telephone surveys since 1990, 
when Feinstein ran for governor, have changed noticeably. Four years ago, 
registered voters agreeing that it was time for a woman governor never topped 
40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he says, registered voters agree 46% to 40%, and Democrats -- with far 
more women registered than men -- agree by 58%. Republicans, with a 
preponderant male registration, disagreed by almost the same factor, 56%.

JUDGE RESTORES STATE PROTECTION FOR RODENT; WILDLIFE: THE RULING ON THE MOHAVE 
GROUND SQUIRREL IS BELIEVED TO BE THE FIRST JUDICIAL ACTION AGAINST AN 
ENDANGERED SPECIES 'DELISTING.' OFFICIALS SAY 200 DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS HAVE 
BEEN AFFECTED BY THE ANIMAL'S STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rejecting the plans of Kern County developers in favor of a nine-inch-long 
burrowing rodent, a judge has issued a precedent-setting ruling that keeps the 
Mohave ground squirrel on the state's endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling is believed by environmental experts to be the first by a 
California judge on the emerging issue of "delisting" plants or animals from 
the state list of endangered species. In contrast, the gray whale was delisted 
under federal law just last week. 
</P>
<P>
 But on the state level, San Francisco Superior Court Judge Thomas J. Mellon 
Jr. said last Thursday that the state Fish and Game Commission did not properly 
follow the law when it issued a controversial 1993 decision to take the 
cinnamon-colored squirrel off the threatened species list. 
</P>
<P>
 Siding with the rodent on a technicality, the judge said substantial evidence 
would appear to back the commission. But state law demands an extensive 
environmental review, he said, adding that there needs to be a far more 
thorough study of the impact of urbanization on the squirrel's desert habitat, 
which includes stretches of the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling has the practical effect of keeping the squirrel from becoming the 
first species in the 23-year history of the California Endangered Species Act 
to lose the protection of the list. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for environmental groups that brought suit after the commission's 
May, 1993, delisting hailed the judge's ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once again the Fish and Game Commission is wrong and we're right," exulted 
Mark Palmer, executive director of the Sacramento-based Mountain Lion 
Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mohave ground squirrels will sleep better tonight in their little 
burrows," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Roy Ashburn, the Kern County supervisor who spearheaded the bid to delist the 
squirrel, could not be reached for comment. Nor could lawyers at the county 
counsel's office. 
</P>
<P>
 The fate of the squirrel, however, has long made for hot politics in arid Kern 
County, pitting conservationists against developers -- with elected officials, 
at both the county and state levels, railing against the squirrel. 
</P>
<P>
 A Bakersfield assemblywoman once asserted in campaign speeches that people 
should violate the law and "barbecue the Mohave ground squirrel," if necessary, 
to feed their families. 
</P>
<P>
 When the commission issued its May, 1993, delisting decision, Ashburn called 
it a victory. "This one is for the human species," he said then. "People in 
Kern County have suffered under the most outrageous form of heavy-handed 
treatment over these last years." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 200 development projects, including residential subdivisions, have 
died or languished because of state protection of the squirrel, Kern County 
officials have said repeatedly. No dollar estimate has been available for 
squirrel-related losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The squirrel lives among the Joshua trees and creosote of Kern, Los Angeles, 
San Bernardino and Inyo counties. It is found nowhere else on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 It feeds on the fruit, leaves and seeds of the desert plants, which sustain it 
for the seven months -- August to February -- that it typically spends dormant 
in underground burrows. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no accurate count of the squirrel population, fish and game 
biologists say. The count can vary dramatically from year to year, depending on 
the weather, biologists said. 
</P>
<P>
 John Gustafson, a fish and game biologist, said the department believes that 
the count has declined in recent years as chunks of the squirrel's desert 
habitat -- particularly in the Antelope and Apple valleys -- give way to 
houses, shopping malls and office complexes. 
</P>
<P>
 The squirrel is a charter member of the state's endangered species list. It 
was designated as a "rare" animal when the first list came out in 1971. The 
designation was changed to "threatened" when the state act was amended in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 To Kern County officials, however, the squirrel is but a fecund rodent in the 
way of progress. In late 1991, county planners asked the five-member Fish and 
Game Commission to take the squirrel off the list -- the first time such a 
request had ever been made. 
</P>
<P>
 A fish was once removed from the list because it had died out. A plant was 
removed because it was found not to be a distinct and separate species. 
</P>
<P>
 On the federal level, authorities have delisted nearly two dozen species since 
the U.S. Endangered Species Act was enacted in 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, 1993, after a debate dominated by economic questions, the Fish and 
Game Commission voted to delist the squirrel. 
</P>
<P>
 Alarmed, a coalition of environmental groups filed suit in August in San 
Francisco, where several of the groups are based. The Mountain Lion Foundation 
was joined in the suit by the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra 
Club, the Desert Protective Council and Defenders of Wildlife. 
</P>
<P>
 In November, the state's administrative law office overturned the Fish and 
Game Commission, citing another technicality -- ruling that the commission did 
not adequately address public comments before a second vote in August, 1993, 
confirming its decision to delist the squirrel. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that decision, the squirrel has never actually been taken off the 
list. The administrative law office regularly reviews the commission's 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Mellon issued his ruling in the court case. The "whole of the 
administrative record" before the Fish and Game Commission, the judge noted, 
provided the panel with substantial evidence to delist. But without a complete 
environmental review, he said, the panel had acted prematurely. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge issued only a two-page ruling, calling it a notice of intended 
decision and saying he plans later to provide a lengthier opinion. An appeal, 
lawyers and environmental experts said, is almost certain.

SLUM REMOVAL FOLLOWS TWISTED PATH; HOUSING: EFFORT TO MOVE FARM WORKERS FROM 
RUN-DOWN OXNARD TRAILER PARK HAS BEEN MARRED BY CLAIMS OF CORRUPTION, 
SWEETHEART DEALS AND BETRAYAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARYL KELLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 What began two years ago as a city effort to move farm workers out of an 
Oxnard slum may soon end with the $2.6-million purchase of a low-income housing 
parcel -- but the torturous route to closing the deal has been littered with 
disputed claims of improper behavior by officials, sweetheart deals and 
betrayal. 
</P>
<P>
 After a state inspection of the Oxnard Mobilehome Lodge found hundreds of 
health and safety violations in 1991, city officials pledged to relocate 1,100 
poor residents, packed eight per trailer beneath worn electrical lines in one 
of Ventura County's densest, most hazardous enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the last two years, the trailer park relocation has twice lurched 
forward and stalled -- first because of homeowner opposition and then because 
of protracted negotiations marred by back-room City Council disputes and a 
landowner's accusation that one councilman made inappropriate requests of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say they think they have finally struck a deal with Donald T. Kojima 
-- a financially troubled real estate speculator who is friendly with public 
officials -- to buy 20 acres of farmland near St. John's Regional Medical 
Center for housing and a 14-acre park and school site from him for $4.78 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is a deal that council members Andres Herrera and Tom Holden say should 
have closed months ago had city negotiators not lost their way. And if 
Councilman Michael Plisky had not engaged in what was essentially a back-room 
filibuster to stop it, Herrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Government should not work this way," Herrera said last week. "This should 
have been a very simple business deal." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it languished as Plisky publicly declared in February that the 
pending purchase of Kojima's parkland was the worst city deal he had ever seen. 
In private council sessions he argued that the city should let Kojima declare 
bankruptcy, then buy the park and housing parcels more cheaply. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was an unrelenting antagonism by Plisky on the Kojima project . . . 
that was just too personal," Herrera said. "We were really getting into it in 
the back room. The discussions were heated." 
</P>
<P>
 Kojima now charges that Plisky made inappropriate requests related to his land 
in 1992, then engaged in a personal vendetta to try to kill the sales when the 
landowner refused to cooperate. "I was shocked" by the requests, Kojima said in 
an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think some unreasonable requests were made of me (by Plisky) . . . in 
regards to our land," said Kojima, who refused to elaborate. "My dealings with 
everybody else have always been aboveboard. I've never encountered anything 
inappropriate from any of the other council members." 
</P>
<P>
 Others confirm that Plisky -- following a controversial practice he has 
employed with other developers -- upset Kojima by referring him to political 
consultant and lobbyist Donald A. Gunn after Kojima sought Plisky's help in 
land-use matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Kojima would not comment on the referral or what one source said was Gunn's 
proposed $35,000 fee except to say, "I don't want to get into Gunn or any of 
that stuff. My situation is real delicate." 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky acknowledges referring Kojima to lobbyist Gunn -- who had been Plisky's 
campaign manager for a decade -- after Kojima came to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needed help with the planning process and he asked me who would I 
recommend. And I believe I told him Don Gunn," Plisky said. "That was the end 
of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did not make any improper requests," he added. "I don't think he 
encountered anything inappropriate from me." 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky said he opposed purchase of Kojima's parkland only because the city had 
agreed to advance nearly half the $780,000 price to pay off the landowner's bad 
debts and stop foreclosure proceedings. Kojima could have declared bankruptcy 
and left the city standing in line for repayment, Plisky said. Other city 
officials said Kojima's equity in the land covered any potential loss. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never had anything against Kojima, and I still don't," Plisky said. "I just 
didn't like the (parkland) deal, and I still don't. Even Herrera is smart 
enough to understand that." 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky noted that earlier this year he voted for a change in the city's 
northeast area plan that allows houses on Kojima's land and made it more 
valuable. And -- after a meeting with Kojima last weekend -- the councilman 
said he now supports city purchase of both Kojima parcels. 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn said Friday that it would be unethical for him to talk about discussions 
with any potential client, and he declined comment about any fee he might have 
requested of Kojima. But he added: "If Kojima is making this type of statement, 
I personally just think it shows that desperate people say and do desperate 
things." 
</P>
<P>
 As tensions about the Kojima deal have played out behind the scenes, 
allegations that the City Council was bailing Kojima out of a bad land 
investment were circulated by several opponents, beginning last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 And after Kojima was the host of Holden's 40th birthday party at the exclusive 
Tower Club atop an Oxnard bank building in late March, Holden's relationship 
with the businessman became an issue, because the council had only recently 
approved $360,000 in advance payments to Kojima and because two of his land 
deals were still pending. 
</P>
<P>
 Holden said he sees no conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 Kojima is a friend with whom he sometimes has dinner, Holden said. Kojima was 
host of the councilman's birthday party only in the sense that his membership 
gained the party's access to the club, the councilman said. Holden's family 
paid for the surprise celebration, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's about time we had people (on the council) who keep their 
relationships out in the public rather than in the back room," Holden said. "To 
separate social from political, that's not a problem for me. I have personal 
relationships with many people in this city. I don't use my position to close 
down my relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the city's efforts to move farm workers out of their tiny, tattered 
trailers -- away from 50-year-old electrical lines and water pipes that often 
rupture -- had been further slowed by maneuvering by Kojima and two low-cost 
housing firms to grab a share of the lucrative, 115-home construction contract 
for the Kojima parcel, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 And as talks have dragged on, the new owner of the ramshackle trailer park 
decided that she would not close it after all, but instead invest $300,000 to 
meet minimum health and safety standards. 
</P>
<P>
 So city officials now say trailer park residents may have to qualify for the 
new housing project just like anyone else, even though two dozen park residents 
trained under a city grant for the last year to run their own housing 
corporation. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also acknowledge that the low-income housing they want to build -- 
preferably manufactured single-family dwellings -- will cost $90,000 to 
$100,000, which may be too much for most trailer park residents to afford, even 
with government subsidies. 
</P>
<P>
 To Luis Teran, who first petitioned the City Council to improve conditions at 
his shabby trailer park 12 years ago, such news shatters a dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am an American," said the 61-year-old retired celery picker who heads the 
trailer park's resident council. "I want to be able to own my own home. That's 
my dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Eileen McCarthy of California Rural Legal Assistance in Oxnard said 
the city's new position represents a breach of trust by officials who have 
promised much but delivered nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is beyond betrayal," she said. "They just don't want to put that much 
money into housing for farm workers."

ON CALIFORNIA: A NIGHT ON THE COUCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER H. KING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Friday night in the burbs. The kids are playing. The pizza man is en route. 
The television is tuned to the NBA Finals. Patrick Ewing goes high above the 
rim and slams down a shot. This is life. This can't last. 
</P>
<P>
 The picture changes. Madison Square Garden is replaced by the San Diego 
Freeway. A helicopter camera is locked on a white Ford Bronco. The shot widens 
to show half a dozen black-and-whites following in formation. A CHP dispatcher 
is debriefed hastily by a local anchor. The vehicle, he confirms, belongs to Al 
Cowlings, who had gone AWOL earlier in the day with O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is in the back seat, "holding a gun to his head." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispatcher seems rushed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to get off now," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go do," the anchor says crisply, "what you have to do." 
</P>
<P>
 The kindergartner comes into the family room. She notices the television, 
senses the tension. "What is this?" she asks. The television is turned off. A 
retreat is made to a set in the back bedroom. Who knows what this is? Certainly 
not something for little children. Maybe not something for adults. "We are 
going to try," the anchor says, "to get back to that basketball game as soon as 
we can." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After five minutes, the initial flinch relaxes. No longer does it seem so 
likely that, in the next moment, the Bronco will jerk to the shoulder, its 
occupants dead. The squad cars stay back. This is not a pursuit, but an escort. 
On every channel the picture is the same, a white Bronco rolling slowly down an 
empty freeway. Only the commentary varies. 
</P>
<P>
 Larry King interviews an "old friend," a doctor, who was with Simpson earlier 
in the day. Is it possible, King inquires, that the football star has lost 
himself "in an unreal world and is not accepting he has done what he did?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, sure," the friend says. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC floats a little box in the corner of the picture, trying to hold its NBA 
audience. Pat Riley pumps his hands joyfully into the air. "This will sound 
bizarre," Conan Nolan cuts in from a car down on the freeway, "but there are 
some people out here who actually have signs. I just passed one group of people 
who have a sign that says, 'Go O.J.' " They want him, he explains, "to buck 
up." 
</P>
<P>
 Psychiatrists are everywhere, speaking in terms of "acute personality 
disorder" and the "dissociative state." Jim Hill pleads with O.J. on the air to 
"be a man." A former linebacker named Cheyunski tells Channel 2 only God can 
help O.J. now. Linda Breakstone is asked to describe what "philosophy" the LAPD 
will bring to an arrest. "He will be brought directly to Parker Center," she 
reports. "No more this, that and the other place." 
</P>
<P>
 The doorbell rings. "Pizza man," the children shout. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bronco rolls on. Through the window it's possible to make out Cowlings 
behind the wheel. His methods might be suspect, but more than anything Cowlings 
seems to be that friend everyone hopes they can count on when dark days come. 
Now, as he changes lanes, two cars of trailing onlookers collide. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where are we here, Paul?" an anchor is asked. A good question. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The short answer is Brentwood, approaching Simpson's house. Now all cameras 
are trained on a parked Bronco. Cowlings, poor Cowlings, scurries back and 
forth between the vehicle and a doorway, while Peter Jennings reads from a 
suicide letter: "Please think of the real O.J. and not this lost person." 
Barbara Walters reports Simpson might be placed in a cell next to Erik 
Menendez. Al Michaels reveals he talked to Simpson the day before: "The first 
thing he said was, 'Al, I have got to get out of the media business.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, anti-climatically, with it too dark to see anything and the crowd 
outside edging beyond control, rocking cars, shouting "Juice," a CBS street 
reporter brings the news: "O.J. Simpson just gave himself up." 
</P>
<P>
 And down the hall, the kids are found asleep in their beds. When? And in the 
empty family room, cold pizza is served with expert analysis. The deep voices 
all agree electronic history has been made. ESPN's legal affairs correspondent 
declares it foolish to prosecute Cowlings. And a psychiatrist says to expect 
something like a hangover in the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 For in the morning, the adrenaline will be gone. In the morning, there will be 
cartoons for kids, and questions for adults. What was that all about, and why 
did I watch? For a long time, it had been sort of fun to wonder just how weird 
this new society of ours might someday become. Now the answer is known. And, at 
least from this couch, it's not anything anyone would want to experience again.

ALGERIAN HUMAN RIGHTS LEAGUE PRESIDENT KILLED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of the Algerian Human Rights League, a critic of both sides in 
the nation's political violence, was assassinated Saturday at his office in 
central Algiers, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said several men entered the office of Yousef Fathallah, 64, then 
escaped after one shot him with a silencer-equipped pistol. 
</P>
<P>
 Police provided no information about the killers. There was no claim of 
responsibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Fathallah, a retired lawyer, was elected head of the Human Rights League in 
1991. The independent association has criticized abuses by both sides in the 
two-year conflict pitting Muslim fundamentalist insurgents against security 
forces of the army-backed government. 
</P>
<P>
 Fathallah was an outspoken critic of political violence and not afraid of 
challenging the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of human rights activists, intellectuals, politicians, journalists and 
other prominent Algerians have been killed in an assassination campaign by 
Islamic militants seeking to topple the army-backed government.

DEBT FORGES DESPERATION IN RUSSIAN STEEL TOWN; ECONOMICS: LYSVA'S FACTORY IS 
INSOLVENT, THREATENING THE COMMUNITY. NATIONWIDE, MANY FACE A SIMILAR DILEMMA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The factory stands idle, smothered by debt. The city is flat broke. And 
everyone with a garden is out planting potatoes to see them through the coming 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Two and a half years after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the grimy old 
steel town of Lysva (population 94,000) is a requiem for socialism. Capitalism 
never had a chance to transform this typical company town on the western flank 
of the Ural Mountains; Russia's lurch toward a free market killed Lysva from 
afar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lysva metallurgical factory, which employs one of every eight residents 
here, has halted its operations because it cannot pay the $780,000 in back 
wages owed its 12,000 workers. While Moscow officials put the finishing touches 
on a bankruptcy law, small cities like Lysva across the Russian heartland are 
becoming ever more desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "A woman came to my office last week and begged me to pay her back wages," 
factory President Oleg P. Ananin said. "She said she hadn't eaten anything but 
grass in two days." 
</P>
<P>
 Deaths from alcohol poisoning have increased, and so have suicides, officials 
say. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers are not the only ones going unpaid. 
</P>
<P>
 The factory is far behind on the city, regional and federal taxes that consume 
up to 90% of its meager profits. It can't pay the energy bills that have risen 
2,000% in the last three years. It can't even buy the raw materials needed to 
keep operating. 
</P>
<P>
 The insolvent factory cannot begin to afford its day-care centers, which serve 
80% of the city's preschoolers, or maintain its apartments, in which 70% of all 
city residents still live. 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can the silent plant finance its medical clinics, summer camps, swimming 
pool, hotel, gym, stadium, skiing center or Palace of Culture -- all 
perquisites that workers came to expect under socialism but that make the 
factory wildly uncompetitive in Russia's new market-driven economy. 
</P>
<P>
 In short, the factory that was founded in 1785 by Prince Boris G. Shakhovskoi, 
won the Order of Lenin in 1942 and was privatized as a joint-stock company in 
1992 is now bankrupt. 
</P>
<P>
 And since the giant smoke-belcher once provided up to 67% of the city's tax 
base -- as well as most of its social services -- the city of Lysva has gone 
bust too. 
</P>
<P>
 The city owes $1.1 million in unpaid wages and utility bills. It has slashed 
spending drastically, even cutting in half the subsidies for school lunches, 
but still the deficit is rising, City Administrator Vadim D. Novosyolov said. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the teachers, who have not been paid since March, are threatening to 
strike. 
</P>
<P>
 With its poverty, aging brick buildings and disastrous balance sheet, Lysva is 
typical of thousands of small Russian cities that were built around one major 
-- now troubled -- industry. But unlike unemployed Muscovites, who can often 
find work in the burgeoning private sector, residents of Lysva have nowhere to 
turn if their employer fails. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the inevitable suffering and upheavals, the government of President 
Boris N. Yeltsin now seems determined to allow the weakest of Russia's 
enterprises to restructure or die. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Russia passed its first bankruptcy law last year, 30 enterprises have 
registered as bankrupt, and at least 1,200 more are considered insolvent, 
according to Sergei G. Belyayev, head of the newly created Federal Bankruptcy 
Agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in the last several weeks, however, has the government begun issuing 
concrete instructions on how the bankruptcy law is to be implemented. And it is 
not yet known which of the sinking factories will be bailed out by the 
government and which are to be allowed to shut down or be sold. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the bankruptcy process will give factories such as Lysva's a 
structured way to reorganize, settle debts and possibly attract fresh capital. 
Unless creditors can be assured of payment -- at least by a bankruptcy court -- 
no one will invest here, they note. 
</P>
<P>
 But it will not be easy to persuade Russians that bankruptcy means anything 
less than meltdown. 
</P>
<P>
 The very word bankruptcy inspires terror in a population that for 70 years was 
told that socialism was superior to capitalism because it would never allow a 
factory to go bankrupt and throw workers out into the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "They think bankruptcy means the end, that the factory doors will be nailed 
shut, and no one will ever be let in again," said Viktor V. Golubev, deputy 
director of the bankruptcy agency. "We need to explain to our citizens, and to 
our factory directors . . . that bankruptcy itself does not cause 
unemployment." 
</P>
<P>
 Lysva officials believe that bankruptcy will only give foreigners and the 
Russian mafia a chance to buy up their plant at rock-bottom prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "A small group of people in this country are now amassing a huge amount of 
capital," factory President Ananin said. "Once it becomes profitable to invest 
here . . . they'll buy out our plant. I think this is being masterminded." 
</P>
<P>
 As in many small cities, former Communist Party officials still hold most of 
the powerful positions in Lysva -- and creditors are afraid to tangle with 
them, City Administrator Novosyolov said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see a creditor who would dare to force the city into bankruptcy," 
Novosyolov said. "We will use this to our advantage." 
</P>
<P>
 But local officials believe that the factory could be made profitable if only 
it could get a temporary tax holiday and be relieved of the expense of 
providing its workers with housing, day care, recreation and medical care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, all of this raises our cost of production and lowers our 
competitiveness," said Ananin, who had Novosyolov's city administrator job 
before he became the factory president. "We still have a mixture of socialism 
and a market system." 
</P>
<P>
 The plant has been offered a $150-million credit to buy equipment from Germany 
to manufacture cold-rolled steel. But with annual interest rates at 213% and 
the strapped Russian government slashing subsidies to industry, Ananin said he 
cannot raise the $150 million in matching funds he needs to close the German 
deal -- and is not sure he could pay the money back if he borrowed it. 
</P>
<P>
 He believes declaring bankruptcy will do nothing to help, because neither the 
government nor commercial banks will lend the money the plant needs to 
restructure. 
</P>
<P>
 "So what will happen? The plant will close down," Ananin said. "The people 
will be thrown out into the street. Who will feed them?" 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian labor force today is virtually immobile. Citizens still need 
permission to move to Moscow and St. Petersburg, and even if an unemployed 
Lysva worker found a new job somewhere else, moving would mean giving up a 
heavily subsidized factory apartment and paying steep free-market rent. 
</P>
<P>
 The only private enterprises in Lysva are a few kiosks and street vendors who 
peddle cheap imported clothing, food and liquor. Factory workers lack the 
capital to start a business, officials say, and high taxes kill off law-abiding 
entrepreneurs before their ventures can get off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our situation is like the Great Depression of the 1930s," Ananin said. "There 
are private businesses in this country, but all they do is buy and sell things. 
Anyone who tries to produce anything, in industry or in agriculture, has gone 
bankrupt. In this country, it is not profitable to produce." 
</P>
<P>
 Lysva residents cannot understand why their factory is going under. 
</P>
<P>
 During World War II, the plant made Soviet army helmets, but in the 1960s it 
converted to peacetime production and began churning out kitchen stoves, 
high-quality enamel pots and pans and other metal products. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't make tanks or bullets," Ananin said. "We make consumer products that 
are in demand all over the country." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the metallurgical factory is a mishmash of the obsolete and the 
up-to-date, the hopeless and the promising. 
</P>
<P>
 Until it ground to a halt this spring, the factory was still producing steel 
ingots in open-hearth furnaces with century-old technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The process is so inefficient that the steel coming out of the factory is 
worth at least 15% less than the raw materials and energy that went into 
producing it, said Mikhail M. Balan, the company's new marketing director. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly 2,500 people worked in that department, and their prospects for going 
back to work are slim. Plant managers are hoping to scrape together the money 
to reopen parts of the plant soon -- but with at least 1,500 fewer workers. The 
trade union is protesting the layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's possible that we are just postponing the inevitable, but we don't see 
any other way," union leader Alexander G. Lyamin said. "You may think this is 
strange, but we still think our government ought to help us."

 Like some runaway apparition from the Andes, the rainbow-hued bus chugged 
eastward through the San Fernando Valley, its boisterous occupants dancing and 
singing in the aisles, gulping shots of anise-flavored aguardiente, and 
flaunting their homeland's flag to passing motorists and pedestrians. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is like a little piece of Colombia in the middle of Los Angeles,"' said 
an ecstatic Gustavo Canas, the organizer and musical arranger of the bus, known 
as the Rhumba Express. "We want to show the world our euphoria and happiness." 
</P>
<P>
 Their destination: Pasadena, site of the Rose Bowl's opening World Cup match 
Saturday between the national teams of Colombia and Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colombian squad seemed to play the role of home team, its many boosters 
drawn from those who flew up for the game, as well as immigrants and their 
offspring. Throughout the Rose Bowl rippled a veritable sea of curly blond 
wigs, inspired by the exotic hairstyle favored by Carlos Valderrama, the star 
Colombia midfielder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt a need to accompany my team, " said Jose Fernando Tapias, from Bogota. 
To defray his expenses, Tapias peddled team photos, blond wigs and plastic 
likenesses of team members. 
</P>
<P>
 He and others gathered early Saturday at Van Nuys' Cali Viejo restaurant, 
which organized the expedition using an authentic Colombian-style bus known as 
a chiva . The ride to Pasadena was like something out of a Gabriel Garcia 
Marquez tale, a festive patriotic hour of pregame revelry to the pulsing beat 
of Colombia's unique Afro-Caribbean-Andean music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never experienced anything like this. It's overwhelming," said Francisco 
Restrepo, a California native of Colombian parentage. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon arriving at the Rose Bowl's expansive parking lots, the passengers melded 
into the throngs of animated Colombian fans. A group of 30 visitors from Cali 
marched outside the stadium to the rhythmic chant of "Co-lom-bi-a! Co-lom-bi-a! 
Co-lom-bi-a!" 
</P>
<P>
 After the Colombians lost 3-1 to a tough Romanian squad, the stunned 
Colombians faced a long ride home. Many shed their blond wigs in disappointment 
but vowed their heroes would improve their performance Wednesday against the 
U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too early to give up," said Humberto Romero, an audiovisual specialist 
who came from Washington. "We'll be back strong for the next game." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Things were somewhat dreary for law enforcement officers, who have been 
preparing the World Cup security plan for two years and had braced for possible 
rowdy behavior that often occurs at soccer matches in Europe and South America. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the day "virtually incident-free," Pasadena Police Cmdr. Mary Schander 
said: "The first World Cup came and went with virtually no problems." 
</P>
<P>
 There were relatively few arrests -- and most of them for ticket scalping. A 
Romanian woman fell and broke her leg. A car caught on fire. And the bomb squad 
had to be called in to investigate a suspicious briefcase. It was just a 
briefcase. 
</P>
<P>
 After the game, sheriff's deputies on horseback were posing for tourist 
photographs. Later, things did become more tense as thousands of fans anxious 
to go home waited for their shuttle buses to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 But so trouble-free was the afternoon that some of the 400 sheriff's deputies 
around the stadium were being sent home early. "It's (been) real smooth," said 
deputy Ron Pearce. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pasadena glided through its first World Cup with a slight yawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. Simpson disrupted me more," said Jeff Shaddock, as he bicycled with a 
friend through a tree-lined neighborhood of gracious old homes near the 
stadium. "It's like this every year for the Rose Bowl, so I think they've got 
it down pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 "They've done a very fine job this year in controlling the traffic," said Bob 
Scott, standing in front of his Rosemont Avenue home. "Generally, it's 
gridlocked." 
</P>
<P>
 His 14-year-old son Alex had set up a soda stand on the sidewalk with a group 
of friends to profit from thirsty fans trekking to and from the bowl. They made 
more than $400. 
</P>
<P>
 In Old Town Pasadena, the soccer fans were so well behaved, they could only be 
distinguished by their T-shirts and caps. Otherwise, they blended into the 
usual Saturday night throngs that pack the sidewalk of Colorado Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Merchants reported that business was about normal, although rose vendors said 
sales were down. "It's killing us," said Kacie Case, who had not sold a single 
rose in her 45 minutes on the street.

WORLD CUP / USA 1994; WHO'S O.J.? ASK FOREIGN MEDIA IN U.S. FOR SOCCER; WORLD 
CUP: REPORTERS CAN'T UNDERSTAND WHY AMERICANS ARE MORE INTERESTED IN SIMPSON 
THAN THE INTERNATIONAL GAMES. 
</P>

<P>
 The soccer-mad media people from around the world are a bit confused. 
</P>
<P>
 "What does O.J. stand for?" asked a radio announcer stationed at the 
International Broadcast Center in Dallas, a war-room setting where thousands of 
commentators are giving up-to-the-minute reports on World Cup soccer minutiae. 
</P>
<P>
 When told, he replied, "Oh, never mind. It's not important." 
</P>
<P>
 Not when the world's preeminent sporting event is on hand, including Saturday 
evening's Colombia-Romania match at the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the story of O.J. Simpson that has captivated Americans for the past 
week is hardly being recognized by the 10,000 broadcasters and print 
journalists who have come to the United States to cover World Cup '94. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are most international journalists ignoring the Simpson saga, but 
they are grasping to understand what it is all about, and thus what America is 
all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two hours of a car driving on the freeway and you call that riveting?" asked 
Mark Gleeson, a South African reporting for Reuters. "I'd hate to see these 
Americans at a cricket match." 
</P>
<P>
 Now that is something the sporting press won't have to worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 But when it comes to soccer, not even the downfall of a bona fide American 
sports hero can diminish the frenzy. 
</P>
<P>
 "They would not think of dropping one second of coverage of soccer to talk 
about an American sports star in trouble," said Peter Gee of the Australian 
Broadcasting Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Or more succinctly: "We didn't mention it because he's not a big hero in Hong 
Kong," said Wendy Ha Hon, a television commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 With broadcast powerhouses ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, ESPN and WGN Chicago providing 
live coverage of Friday night's dramatic chase along Southland freeways, the 
rest of the world remained true to its soccer passion. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not so much a news blackout as it was indifference. 
</P>
<P>
 Said a member of the Arab States Broadcasting Union: "The Simpson story is 
purely of American interest. We absolutely did not report it. I think it is 
unfortunate to unfold on the first day of the World Cup after all the 
preparation to bring soccer to America." 
</P>
<P>
 There was more than a little resentment that a crime story would overshadow 
the World Cup, particularly during its American debut. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this Mr. Simpson was (President) Clinton, then I could understand," said 
Elihu Ben-Onn of Israel Radio. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the full-blown live television coverage reinforced foreign 
perceptions of American character. To those who watched, it was an ethereal 
scene resembling a Hollywood movie. 
</P>
<P>
 Ben-Onn found symbolism in the reportage. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is another signal to show how Americans are different," the Israeli sports 
commentator said. "They are busy with local stories on murder when the biggest 
show in the world comes to their country. Maybe they will start driving on the 
left-hand side of the road. Then they would be complete in their uniqueness." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Ben-Onn was eager for details of the Simpson case for his special 
report Saturday night in Jerusalem. But why, he wondered, were Americans 
infatuated with the former USC football star, whose professional career ended 
in 1979? 
</P>
<P>
 "Who is he?" Ben-Onn asked. 
</P>
<P>
 When told Simpson's celebrity was equal to that of Earvin (Magic) Johnson, he 
nodded slowly, if unsurely. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Rose Bowl, Juan Carlos Gonzalez of Guadalajara Notisistema of Mexico 
was equally nonplussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all O.J. Simpson," he said of the coverage, throwing up his hands. "It 
was exaggerated. I'm not sure why the Americans like O.J. Simpson so much." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferdynand S. Grzeszcak of TVP, Polish television, was wondering the same thing 
while sitting alone in his cubicle at the media center adjacent to the Cotton 
Bowl in Dallas. It never occurred to him to mention the Simpson case, focusing 
only on Saturday's matches in Detroit, New York and Pasadena, and other World 
Cup news. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's life, but I don't like it," he said of the murders of Simpson's ex-wife, 
Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 The French, not surprisingly, were equally resistant. Broadcasters at Radio 
SRF laughed when asked if they reported the incident. France, after all, did 
not qualify for the 24-team World Cup so perhaps. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm interested in sports but I've never heard of this guy," a staff member 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aghast, she said of the American media: "They're not even talking about the 
World Cup. Just about this." 
</P>
<P>
 And that was something most foreign journalists failed to comprehend. 
</P>
<P>
 Almond reported from Dallas, Nazario from Pasadena. Times staff writer John 
Hurst also contributed to this story from the Rose Bowl.

DRIVE TO HOST CUP GAMES BEGAN IN '84 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 During the 1984 Olympics, no one expected a third-place battle between 
Yugoslavia and Italy to stir much interest. But, following a run on the ticket 
office, 100,374 people packed the Rose Bowl that night. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe, thought Alan Rothenberg, Olympic soccer commissioner, the United States 
could someday host the World Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg, now the CEO of World Cup USA, worked behind the scenes to bring 
World Cup soccer to America. On July 4, 1988, the United States won the right 
the host the 1994 event. 
</P>
<P>
 Rothenberg, a Los Angeles attorney, was elected president of the U.S. Soccer 
Federation in 1990. He brought professionalism to the organization, which just 
a few years before was a disjointed group that raised some funds with bake 
sales and car washes. 
</P>
<P>
 He organized the federation along the lines of the Los Angeles Olympic 
Organizing Committee -- of which he had been a part. As expected, Rothenberg 
expertly maneuvered Los Angeles into the central role of the event. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 17, they'll play the World Cup finals at the Rose Bowl, the eighth cup 
game played there -- more than in any other U.S. city. BILL DWYRE

BILL BOYARSKY: THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; HANDLING OF CHASE, SURRENDER SHOWS 
POLICE DESERVE A RAISE 
</P>

<P>
 The gag after O.J. Simpson escaped from the Los Angeles cops was: "And these 
guys want a raise?" 
</P>
<P>
 Several hours later, after watching the chase and Simpson's surrender to 
police who had done their job under extraordinary pressure and public 
attention, I thought, "Right. And they deserve it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone had their own reactions to Friday's drama. To some, it was the fall 
of a hero. Others were preoccupied with the thrill of a televised chase, a 
buddies-on-the-loose movie, happening before our eyes. Then there was the 
tragedy of the victims, the long-battered ex-spouse, Nicole, trapped in a 
dangerous relationship, and her friend, Ronald Goldman. And the Simpson 
children, whose psychological damage will surely stick with them through their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The police pay raise was on my mind, as well, probably because I was gathering 
material for a column on the subject. What a time to be demanding a raise, 
during such a high-pressure case. 
</P>
<P>
 So, in the middle of the O.J. Simpson drama on Friday, I walked from the paper 
across Spring Street to City Hall to interview people on an issue that at that 
moment seemed almost irrelevant. Television news vans were parked on the 
sidewalk, getting ready for Simpson's arraignment, scheduled for later in the 
day at the Criminal Courts Building across the street. There was a lot of 
excitement building around Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside City Hall, the pay dispute was quietly heading toward settlement, with 
the council ready to approve a 7% raise next week, plus bonuses for patrol work 
and extra money for equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 I had mixed emotions about it -- and the police. I felt the cops deserved a 
good raise. The City Council, the mayor and assorted bureaucrats had sat on 
their hands for months during negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the leaders of the cops' union, the Police Protective League, had 
been behaving badly. They made plans to disrupt World Cup festivities. They 
threatened to investigate and publicize the private lives of City Council 
members and Mayor Richard Riordan. Crooks engage in blackmail, not cops. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't the only one unhappy with the union's loudmouth faction. Councilman 
Richard Alatorre who, along with Riordan, put the settlement together, told me 
about his two days of meetings with the league board. Alatorre loves the cops, 
but even he seemed miffed. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he told the board how he felt "in my own inimitable style. After every 
five words, you might at least be able to put one of them in your newspaper." 
</P>
<P>
 I went over to the mayor's office to get Riordan's opinion. He was pleased 
about the settlement. "I think it was a very reasonable deal," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan is as much a cop-lover as Alatorre, but as we talked, the subject of 
the union's tactics came up. "I'm not someone anyone is going to push around or 
intimidate," Riordan said. However, he wondered about the rebelliousness some 
of the union leaders had been spreading before the settlement and whether "a 
certain percentage (of police) will be infected with that the rest of their 
careers." 
</P>
<P>
 The interview over, Riordan said, "Let's go watch O.J." We stood in front of a 
small television set in his inner office, waiting for Simpson to be brought 
into the Criminal Courts Building for his arraignment. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Simpson didn't show up. We got tired of waiting, and I returned to 
the paper. Police Cmdr. David J. Gascon was on television, announcing that 
Simpson had escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 A rebellious union. An escaped celebrity suspect. What a bad day for the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But by evening, we'd all seen how good the department could be. 
</P>
<P>
 I watched the chase on television at home. Toward the end, I could hear the 
news helicopters overhead as the bizarre procession, northbound on the San 
Diego Freeway, passed Olympic Boulevard, near our house. 
</P>
<P>
 Not long after, when the chase ended at Simpson's mansion, you could see the 
LAPD's skill. Even the dim pictures at nightfall gave viewers a sense of the 
careful conversations that drew Simpson from the Ford Bronco. Nobody ran around 
hysterically. SWAT team members, in their bulletproof vests, stayed in the 
background. 
</P>
<P>
 The whole country was watching. Screwing this one up would bring out every 
second-guesser from here to the Atlantic Coast. But the cops operated with the 
talent and efficiency of one of O.J.'s old Trojan teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Give them a raise. They've earned it.

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; BRENTWOOD NO LONGER A 'NICE LITTLE SECRET'; COMMUNITY: 
THE ONCE SLEEPY ENCLAVE SQUIRMS UNDER THE GLARE OF THE SUDDEN MEDIA SPOTLIGHT. 
SPECTATORS ARE DRAWN TO THE NOW INFAMOUS LANDMARKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Never before has there been a week quite like the past one in the Westside 
neighborhood of Brentwood. 
</P>
<P>
 In the space of five days, a quiet, sleepy enclave of gated homes, fashionable 
boutiques and a main boulevard dotted with sweeping coral trees, has been the 
scene of a double murder, a constant media vigil and the grand finale of a 
spectacular car chase. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, a community where the biggest street disruption is the annual spring 
Art Festival on San Vicente Boulevard found itself the site of a tense standoff 
between O.J. Simpson and the police, as hordes of onlookers cheered and waited. 
</P>
<P>
 In the resulting limelight, a community squirms. "It has focused a spotlight 
on a neighborhood that really doesn't want a spotlight on it," said David 
Horowitz, who understands both sides: He's a Channel 2 consumer reporter and 
the honorary mayor of Brentwood. He's also a neighbor of O.J. Simpson on North 
Rockingham Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Nestled between Santa Monica and Westwood, Brentwood basks in its low profile. 
Property values are high and shops are expensive, though it's a community with 
hundreds of apartments (the slain waiter, Ronald Lyle Goldman, lived in one 
just around the corner from the local Starbucks) and it's hardly off the beaten 
track. (As the nationally televised chase showed, it's just off the 405 at 
Sunset.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Brentwood residents Saturday spoke repeatedly and affectionately of their 
community as secluded, close-knit and very safe, a place where you can stroll 
at all hours. "I see people running and walking their dogs at 1 in the 
morning," said one resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Celebrities such as Roseanne Arnold and James Garner, politicians such as the 
district attorney and the mayor are part of the terrain; they pass unbothered 
through grocery stores and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brentwood used to be a nice little secret," said screenwriter Myles 
Berkowitz, who lives in a Montana Avenue apartment south of Sunset Boulevard. 
"Beverly Hills got all the publicity for this kind of stuff. Santa Monica had 
its politics." 
</P>
<P>
 "I kind of feel the community is like a small town," Horowitz said. "It has 
the little country mart. It has its own newspaper." (This month, the Brentwood 
News features a story on its cover about the new library and another about a 
young girl bitten in a back yard by a rattlesnake.) 
</P>
<P>
 Brentwood, with its sprinkling of restaurants, was rarely a destination for 
anyone other than a resident or their friends. Now, there are maps of the place 
in national newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thing you don't have to do now is explain where Brentwood is," said Ron 
Prather, a computer company executive sipping coffee Saturday morning outside 
Starbucks. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Brentwood has become, at least for the moment, an infamous landmark. 
</P>
<P>
 "You find people who come in because they want to be photographed in front of 
O.J.'s house," said Horowitz. "They want to say they ate at Mezzaluna, the 
restaurant where the dead waiter worked. They want to walk the streets O.J. 
walked." 
</P>
<P>
 The closer people lived to Simpson, the more violated they feel by the 
invasion. Horowitz said one neighbor affixed a sign to her bushes with a big 
arrow pointing in the direction of Simpson's house under the words "media 
circus." 
</P>
<P>
 For other residents, though, there is just the eerie feeling that they now 
live in a place that has been plastered over television screens coast to coast. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weirdest part is you know all the places," said attorney Lexie Sims, who 
lived in Brentwood until recently. "You've been to Mezzaluna, you've seen the 
condo complex and thought about renting there. Some of my friends say you can 
still see the blood on the walkway." 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, it seemed as if everyone who lives in Brentwood had seen the 
Simpsons or knew them a little or knows someone who knows them. "The first day 
(after the murders) when I went to the gym, the guy on the bike behind me was 
talking about how his friend built the condo," said Sims. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, people interviewed Saturday struggled to reconcile the horror of the 
charges against Simpson with the fact that he was so popular. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. was really well-liked," said Horowitz. "He would say hi to the 
neighbors. He and Nicole would walk around with their babies and talk to 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Like the rest of the city, Brentwood residents stayed glued to their 
television sets and spent the morning poring over newspaper accounts and 
talking with friends about the events. 
</P>
<P>
 Few took advantage of their proximity to watch in person the final harrowing 
moments of the Simpson chase. Most of his immediate neighbors were appalled at 
the crowds and worried for their safety, according to Horowitz, who said his 
teen-age daughter asked if she could go down the street to the Simpson house as 
the police closed in on him. "I said, 'Absolutely not. There's a crowd down 
there. There are armed police officers. You have the makings of a riot.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But for a few, the epic event simply had to be seen firsthand. "It was like 
'Dog Day Afternoon,' " said screenwriter Berkowitz, who dashed up Barrington 
Avenue to witness for himself Simpson's turn onto Sunset from the freeway. "By 
the time I got back home, I had 13 phone messages."

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; COWLINGS SEEN AS A HERO AND A MEDDLER; FRIENDSHIP: 
SOME SAY SIMPSON'S COMPANION SAVED HIS LIFE AND HELPED THE SITUATION END 
PEACEFULLY. POLICE SAY HE MADE A DANGEROUS SITUATION WORSE. 
</P>

<P>
 The man at O.J. Simpson's side as he threatened suicide and led police on a 
bizarre, two-county chase -- lifelong friend Al Cowlings -- was alternately 
described Saturday as a hero who saved the celebrity's life and a potentially 
dangerous meddler who helped him avoid arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Observers ranging from ordinary people to medical experts credited Cowlings -- 
widely known as "A.C." -- with acting as the ultimate friend, possibly risking 
his own life to prevent Simpson from killing himself or being killed by police. 
</P>
<P>
 The nationally broadcast images of Cowlings pleading with police at Simpson's 
home impressed many as the culmination of his lifelong devotion to Simpson -- 
the teammate, roommate and soul mate who achieved greater success. 
</P>
<P>
 "A.C. is one of the most loyal, trusting friends anyone could have," said 
Cowlings' attorney, Donald M. Re. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am absolutely convinced his only effort (Friday) was to make sure that O.J. 
surrendered alive. I'm very hopeful that the district attorney will take that 
into account, and will see fit not to bring charges against him," said Re, who 
was co-counsel to Howard Weitzman in the John Z. DeLorean case. 
</P>
<P>
 Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti on Saturday declined to commit himself, saying that 
evidence against Cowlings still had to be reviewed. But, he allowed, "there is 
always a possibility that we would decline to prosecute." 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings, 47, was taken into custody Friday night and booked on suspicion of 
aiding and abetting a fugitive. Held briefly on $250,000 bond, he made bail 
early Saturday and returned to the Pacific Palisades home where he has been 
staying since January. 
</P>
<P>
 A haggard-looking Cowlings refused to be interviewed Saturday, driving 
reporters away from the house and cursing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, just stay out of my ------- house," Cowlings said, emerging in a 
turquoise T-shirt and jeans. "I have no comment. None." 
</P>
<P>
 When a TV reporter and cameraman approached him, Cowlings took several steps 
toward them and yelled: "Get that camera out of here!" Then he got inside his 
white Mercedes-Benz and sped off, in reverse, down the narrow residential 
street. Cowlings returned about 30 minutes later and knocked another cameraman 
to the ground, according to the Associated Press. 
</P>
<P>
 "You gotta understand," Cowlings' host, Darrell Ruocco, said after the first 
outburst, "he's under a lot of strain." Ruocco said he was a friend of Cowlings 
and Simpson and added: "They're just stand-up guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Police offered a different view of Cowlings, saying the retired pro football 
player helped Simpson avoid arrest Friday morning when the two slipped away 
from the designated surrender point at an Encino house. Later, he injected 
himself into an extremely volatile situation at Simpson's Brentwood mansion, 
police say, when officers had to coax the armed athlete from his truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Mike Albanese, a SWAT team member and the supervisor of Friday's lead 
negotiator, said that when Cowlings emerged from the white Ford Bronco he was 
"bouncing around the scene" in an agitated state, screaming: " 'He has a gun! 
Don't do anything!' " Officers were reluctant to arrest or restrain Cowlings 
for fear of setting off Simpson, Albanese said. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, when Simpson's adult son unexpectedly bolted from his father's 
house and lunged toward the truck -- a moment captured on TV -- Cowlings shoved 
the younger man away, prompting officers to fear that the two would get into a 
fistfight and infuse the scene with even more emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all very distracting, Albanese said, and interfered with officers' 
ability to directly and calmly connect with Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "His activities certainly made the situation worse," said LAPD Cmdr. David 
Gascon at a news conference after Simpson's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 After the chase, Cowlings came inside the house and calmed down, and Albanese 
gave him credit for carrying a new cellular phone out to Simpson when Simpson's 
phone battery gave out. In delivering the phone, Albanese said, Cowlings 
enabled police to continue negotiating with Simpson and he protected them from 
exposure to the armed and unpredictable suspect. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those interviewed Saturday, the prevailing view was that Cowlings had 
acted courageously and deserved praise, not prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think he saved (Simpson's) life. I really do," said a 20-year friend of 
Simpson who asked not to be named. "And I think a lot of people think that is 
what a friend would do." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can certainly understand why Al did what he did," said a Pacific Palisades 
neighbor who also asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would do the same," said another. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts such as Lilli Friedland, a Century City psychologist who serves on the 
board of the American Psychological Assn., agreed, saying the love of friends 
and children is often what keeps suicidal people alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Put yourself there," Friedland said. "One of your best friends in life and 
someone you admire and think the world of gets accused of a terribly heinous 
crime, and you may know that at times he hit his wife or whatever . . . and you 
see him crazed, depressed, super-stressed, distraught over the death -- 
regardless of his role in it, if any -- and then you see him talking like his 
life isn't going to mean anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, what would you do as a truly loving, caring friend?" Friedland asked. 
"You don't stop to think, 'How real is this?' What you do is say: 'What can I 
do to help my friend?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings has shadowed Simpson since the two were boys on Potrero Hill, one of 
San Francisco's toughest neighborhoods. They played football together at 
Galileo High School, played and roomed together at USC, and when the two 
athletes turned professional, Cowlings followed Simpson to the Buffalo Bills 
and the San Francisco 49ers. Simpson's first wife, Marguerite Whitley, was 
originally Cowling's girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 As middle-aged men, when Simpson's success had far outshone Cowlings', A.C. 
became something of a bodyguard for O.J. and was a regular visitor at his 
mansion. At Nicole Brown Simpson's funeral last week, Cowlings played 
gatekeeper. And when Simpson slipped out of the Encino safehouse where he was 
supposed to surrender to police, it was Cowlings who went with him and who 
would stay with him throughout the long day. 
</P>
<P>
 "He may well have saved his life," said Michael Peck, a psychologist once 
associated with the now-defunct Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I seriously doubt that he thought he was committing a crime when he was doing 
it," Peck said. "He thought he was helping his friend."

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; NOW HE'S PRISONER NO. 4013970; IN L.A. COUNTY JAIL'S 
'HIGH POWER UNIT,' SIMPSON IS ISOLATED IN A 9-BY-7 CELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILES CORWIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 O.J. Simpson is the latest in a long line of the famous and the infamous to 
beheld in a special Los Angeles County Jail wing deputies call the "high power 
unit." The inmates refer to it as "death row." 
</P>
<P>
 This is where the snitches and the serial killers are held, where the 
celebrities and the dirty cops are kept away from the general jail population 
for their own protection. 
</P>
<P>
 The 9-by-7-foot cells in the unit line both sides of a stark, gray-walled 
corridor on the jail's second floor. There are about a dozen cells, each with a 
reinforced security door. Painted in the hallway, outside each cell, is a red 
stripe -- called a "deadline" -- to warn jail trustees, and deputies, not to 
gawk. 
</P>
<P>
 The celebrated defendants that have been housed in the unit include actors 
Todd Bridges and Sean Penn, Night Stalker Richard Ramirez, Hillside Strangler 
Kenneth Bianchi and accomplice Angelo Buono, financier Charles H. Keating Jr. 
and accused child molester Raymond Buckey. Lyle and Erik Menendez were housed 
there before they were transferred to another high security unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Referred to as simply O.J. by his legion of fans, Simpson is now known in jail 
by a booking number: 4013970. Instead of a 5,752-square-foot Brentwood estate, 
he will be spending his days in a 63-square-foot cell. And the man who once 
displayed his athletic skills before great crowds of cheering fans now will be 
escorted several days a week to the jail's concrete exercise yard, where he can 
lift weights or shoot baskets -- alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson is under a suicide watch in the unit, jail officials say. Every 15 
minutes, a guard wanders by, peers into his cell and checks off a card on the 
door, ensuring that his condition is regularly monitored. The cell has been 
stripped of anything that Simpson could use to harm himself or others; it 
contains only a toilet, a sink and a bunk. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates in the unit lead a much more constricted life than the general jail 
population: Simpson will not eat in the chow hall; his meals will be brought to 
his cell. He will be escorted to the showers, alone, every other day. 
</P>
<P>
 He will not have access to the television room. Instead, a television will be 
rolled into his cell for a few hours a day. And he will not see his visitors in 
the main visiting room, but instead through a glass partition down the hall 
from his cell. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the complexity of his case, it is expected that this wing of the 
jail -- known officially as the 7000 unit -- will be Simpson's home for some 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know exactly what he's going through," said Rickey Ross, a former deputy 
who once faced a highly publicized murder charge and spent 82 days in the unit. 
"The isolation is hell . . . there's no more lonely feeling in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Ross recently was tried, in another case, with attempting to purchase a large 
quantity of cocaine from an undercover agent. The case ended in a mistrial. 
</P>
<P>
 "As bad as being in that cell was, going to court is worse," Ross said. "O.J. 
will feel like he's on display for everyone in the world. It's almost like it's 
an out-of-body experience, like it's happening to someone else. It'll be so 
humiliating for him that his cell will eventually become a refuge." 
</P>
<P>
 The nights are the worst time, said veteran jailhouse informant Leslie White, 
who has been in the 7000 unit about half a dozen times during the past 15 
years. Inmates can hear other men in the unit crying at night. Down the hall, 
in the mental ward, men scream until morning. Others in the nearby hospital 
wing, coming down off PCP, pound on their cell doors and wail. 
</P>
<P>
 Many inmates will probably try to curry favor with Simpson because of his 
celebrity and wealth, White said. They soon will be trying to slip him candy 
bars -- the new jailhouse currency now that smoking is no longer allowed -- 
when passing in the tier. 
</P>
<P>
 But some inmates, if they had the chance, might attack him, said J.C. Reiff, a 
recently retired sheriff's deputy who worked in the unit for three years. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like the old Westerns -- there's always some guy who will go after 
someone famous so they can make a name for themself," Reiff said. "And just the 
fact that someone like him has bucks . . . some inmates may try ways to extort 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 It is possible that Simpson would be comfortable in the general population, 
Reiff said, but the Sheriff's Department cannot take any chances. If anything 
happened to such a high-profile inmate, it would be a public relations 
disaster. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a tremendous amount of curiosity among the general jail population, 
and the public at large, about celebrity felons, Reiff said. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the most degrading experiences I've ever had was when some sheriffs 
brought a tour up to the unit," Ross said. "I felt like an animal in a zoo. 
These were officials of some kind, and the deputies pointed to us and told them 
what we were in for. It was the only time I completely lost it." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson arrived at the County Jail on Friday at 10:20 p.m. Unlike most 
inmates, he was not transported on a county bus with barred windows, but was 
whisked to the jail in a police car. 
</P>
<P>
 Inmates and guards familiar with the booking process said Simpson was given a 
red plastic wristband with his booking number on it -- to distinguish him from 
most general population inmates, who wear white bands. He then was given a blue 
jumpsuit, was fingerprinted and had his mug shot taken. A medical technician 
gave him a blood test and a chest X-ray. 
</P>
<P>
 He was then escorted to his cell by a host of deputies and a sergeant. Famous

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; TOGETHER, NICOLE SIMPSON'S FAMILY FACES PAIN, BEGINS 
HEALING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The family of Nicole Brown Simpson said Saturday that her young children are 
demonstrating "the uncanny ability to momentarily set aside life's bitterness 
to enjoy life's goodness" and are coping well with the tragedies of the past 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 In an eloquent statement, the Brown family described the children's efforts to 
deal with their mother's death and the family's attempts to begin recovering 
from the bizarre series of events that started with the slaying and ended with 
the arrest of O.J. Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 "By no means are things 'normal,' so to speak, but with the immense love and 
support we are all receiving from each other, we will all survive stronger in 
spirit, stronger as people, and stronger as a family," said the statement, 
which also was signed by Jason and Arnelle Simpson, O.J. Simpson's children by 
his first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sydney and Justin Simpson, ages 9 and 6, have spent the last few days at their 
grandparents' home in Monarch Bay following as normal a routine as possible, 
riding bikes, fishing, going to the beach and playing handball, POGs and video 
games with their cousins and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 But they have also been counseled by a family priest. "We talked about where 
Mom had gone and they asked me some things about heaven and I tried to answer 
them," said Father Bruce Lavery, who officiated during Nicole Simpson's service 
Thursday at Ascension Cemetery in Lake Forest. 
</P>
<P>
 "The children were very, very aware that something had happened, but they 
acted like any children: They would be solemn for a while and then start 
playing a game or playing with their toys again." 
</P>
<P>
 For the Brown family -- which started the week with the news that Nicole 
Simpson had been brutally stabbed to death and that her ex-husband was the 
chief suspect, then made it through her memorial service, her burial and 
Friday's wild events -- the past few days have taken their toll. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hanging in there. We're doing OK," said Denise Brown, Nicole Simpson's 
older sister, on Saturday. The week had been devastating, she said, "but we 
have to try to keep our spirits up. We have to keep going because of the 
children." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the presence of Sydney and Justin has helped comfort their relatives 
in the bleakest of moments. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the cold darkness of the night, our beloved Nicole was taken from us, but 
even from this black void of despair, there have been two bright lights of 
hope, peace and laughter," the family wrote. "Our Nicole has left us two 
beautiful children who have touched us deeply within, helping us to heal our 
wounds of grief and depression." 
</P>
<P>
 Family members are in seclusion in their gated Monarch Bay community and 
neighbors are fiercely protective of their privacy. The television is 
disconnected at times, Lavery said, apparently to protect the children from 
hearing news reports about their mother and father. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Brown family has been thrust into the spotlight. Those who know them 
best say their closeness, their faith and their fond memories of Nicole are 
helping to pull them through. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the true shattering of the American dream," said Joseph W. Smith, a 
real estate agent in Monarch Bay who has known the Browns for years. "It's a 
tragedy for a great family, a great athlete and a great athlete's family. We 
live down here in Monarch Bay and we think we're in God's country, but tragedy 
can strike anywhere." 
</P>
<P>
 In many ways, the Browns did live the American dream, raising a devoted and 
close-knit family in one of the country's seaside garden spots, giving them the 
best of everything and watching as one of their daughters married one of the 
nation's most popular athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Louis Brown, 70, is a semi-retired real estate investor who once ran O.J. 
Simpson's Hertz Rent a Car franchise at the the Ritz-Carlton Laguna Niguel. 
German-born Juditha, 63, was a full-time mother, raising Denise, now 36, 
Nicole, Dominique, 29, and Tanya, 24. They have an older brother named Rolf, 
45. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Brown was born in Frankfurt, Germany, on May 19, 1959, and grew up in 
the Garden Grove neighborhood of Royal Park Estates. The two eldest girls 
attended Rancho Alamitos High School, and both studied German. By the 
mid-1970s, the family had moved to Monarch Bay in Dana Point, where the 
teen-agers attended Dana Hills High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavery, who has counted the Browns among his congregation for many years, said 
the family was "coping pretty well." 
</P>
<P>
 "They're the type of people who rally at a time like this," he said. "They're 
very close-knit. They're drawing a lot of support from each other right now." 
</P>
<P>
 The priest visited the Browns' home Wednesday, he said, when he was asked to 
counsel the Simpson children and those of other family members while the adults 
attended a viewing of Nicole Simpson's body at a Laguna Hills funeral home. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavery said he gathered the six children around him on the floor, talking to 
them about God, about death and about the funeral and burial services that 
would be held the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Al Cowlings, the longtime friend of O.J. Simpson's who acted as his driver 
during Friday's freeway odyssey, stayed at the Brown home with the children to 
allow the others, including O.J. Simpson, to attend the viewing, Lavery said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the counseling session, Cowlings and the children were planning to head 
to the video store to rent some movies. 
</P>
<P>
 Lavery said the children -- particularly Sydney, whom he described as a 
"little mother" -- were trying to comfort each other. "They're supporting each 
other, just as the adults are," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In their statement, family members emphasized the efforts they have taken to 
protect the children. 
</P>
<P>
 "God in his grace has given these children, as he does all children, the 
uncanny ability to momentarily set aside life's bitterness to enjoy life's 
goodness," they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although aware of their mother's passing, they have been surrounded by 
caring, nurturing family members and friends who have provided an environment 
which has enabled the healing to begin." 
</P>
<P>
 The Browns also thanked the public for concern and prayers in recent days. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph O'Connor, a longtime friend of the Browns and Laguna Hills funeral 
director who made the arrangements for the services, said he still cannot 
believe the circumstances of the past six days. "The situation is just so 
overwhelming at this point that all you can do is put it in God's hands."

THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; PICTURE OF A 'LOST PERSON'; PSYCHOLOGISTS SAY 
SIMPSON'S LETTER AND FLIGHT REFLECT HIS TROUBLED STATE OF MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHERYL STOLBERG, TIMES MEDICAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A goodby letter in which he proclaims his innocence and love for the former 
wife he is accused of killing. A hasty escape as the police close in. An 
aimless freeway drive that eventually takes him back home. A gun pointed at his 
own head. Repeated demands to see his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 The bizarre litany of puzzling actions by football great-turned-murder suspect 
O.J. Simpson reveals a man out of control, in denial, on the verge of killing 
himself and genuinely distraught over the death of Nicole Brown Simpson -- even 
if he was responsible for it, said psychiatrists and psychologists Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 These experts said Simpson's behavior Friday suggests a personality that is 
impulsive -- one that may react instead of thinking things through in a 
deliberate way. 
</P>
<P>
 This impulsiveness could have enhanced Simpson's prowess on the football 
field, which required him to act quickly, almost without thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 And it could explain why Simpson suddenly took flight Friday, turning fugitive 
for 10 hours after cooperating with authorities all week. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the behavior of a man who didn't know what he was doing," said one 
Los Angeles psychologist, who did not want to be identified. "There was no plan 
there. There was no deliberateness. There was going from point to point, moment 
to moment, a certain lack of will." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it may have been Simpson himself who offered the best summation of his 
state of mind Friday. In a poignant letter to the public, read aloud on 
television, the man many called the greatest running back of all time described 
himself sadly as "this lost person." 
</P>
<P>
 The letter was a classic suicide note, most experts said. There were telltale 
clues: Simpson spoke of himself in the past tense. ("I've had a good life.") He 
declared himself unable to continue. ("I can't go on.") He tried to ensure a 
good future for his children. ("Please . . . let my kids live in peace.") 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely a suicide note, and I think it was because of two 
fantasies" that he appeared to have, said Dr. Carole Lieberman, UCLA professor 
of clinical psychiatry who specializes in issues of celebrity. "One was to 
rejoin his wife in death and the other was to leave the question of his 
culpability ambiguous to protect his children." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Michael Peck, a clinical psychologist who worked for 20 years with the 
now-defunct Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center: "The note is a suicide note, 
except for the fact that he didn't commit suicide." 
</P>
<P>
 But the note reveals ambivalence, Peck and others said. It offers personal 
thank-yous to many of his friends, indicating that Simpson knew that he was 
loved by many. Knowing that one's own death would hurt others is often a 
crucial factor in preventing suicide. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts also said Simpson received crucial support from his friend and former 
teammate, Al Cowlings -- who may have broken the law to help his childhood 
buddy. It was Cowlings who helped Simpson escape a San Fernando Valley house 
just as police were about to arrest him in last week's slaying of Nicole Brown 
Simpson and her friend, Ronald Lyle Goldman. And it was Cowlings who drove 
Simpson for hours along Southern California's freeways in perhaps the most 
gripping police pursuit in Los Angeles history. 
</P>
<P>
 Cowlings, Peck said, "may very well have saved (Simpson's) life." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, Simpson may not have intended to kill himself at all, said Lilli 
Friedland, a Century City psychologist. Friedland said Simpson, through his 
letter, may simply have been coming to grips with the fact that his life will 
never be the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was really goodby to the life of super-hero," Friedland said. "I think 
what we started seeing was the disintegration of his public persona, his 
super-hero facade. I think he was witnessing that, while medicated and while 
incredibly distraught." (Simpson's lawyer has said he was taking antidepressant 
drugs.) 
</P>
<P>
 Both Lieberman, the UCLA psychiatrist, and Friedland said Simpson's actions 
also fit squarely with the pattern of an abusive spouse who turns violent as a 
means of controlling a woman he loves and feels powerless over. 
</P>
<P>
 He wrote in his letter that he sometimes felt "like a battered husband" -- an 
indication that she may have hurt him deeply. And he opened the letter by 
declaring his love for Nicole, saying, "If we had a problem, it's because I 
loved her so much." 
</P>
<P>
 That remark, Lieberman said, "is a typical line of what a wife abuser would 
say. You could take that from a script. These men don't see it as hating their 
wives, they see it as being so in love with their wives that they don't want 
their wives to abandon them." 
</P>
<P>
 Also telling, Lieberman said, was Simpson's request to see his mother -- 
another extremely important woman in his life -- at a time when his wife was 
gone. "His wife is dead," she said. "The object of his desire is dead. So his 
very worst fears came true, whether it was his fault or not." 
</P>
<P>
 The experts said it is unlikely that Simpson staged Friday's events in a 
calculated attempt to gain public sympathy or help his own defense by making 
himself seem mentally unbalanced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt that he would have thought clearly enough to plan that out," said 
Peck. "Whether he did it or not, he was in terrible shape. I think he was very 
distraught, one way or the other, and I think that was clear to everybody who 
knew him."

COMMENTARY; THE SIMPSON MURDER CASE; THE ART OF TV NEWS SPECULATION, OR HOW TO 
FILL AIR TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOWARD ROSENBERG, TIMES TELEVISION CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Millions of Americans witnessed accused killer O.J. Simpson's dramatic but 
futile attempt to elude custody Friday. And why not? 
</P>
<P>
 It was extraordinary television. What could compare to it? Live TV coverage of 
the first moonwalk, perhaps? Live TV coverage of the Gulf War, especially the 
initial bombing of Baghdad, reporters flinching in the face of possible Scud 
attacks and Iraqi desert troops surrendering to the media? 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's story had its own special aura, though, its own unique niche. Yet. . 
. .  
</P>
<P>
 Question: Did Simpson run because he was guilty or because he was convinced -- 
based on last week's media coverage of this double-slaying case -- that he had 
already been judged guilty by the press and public and could not get a fair 
trial? We may never know. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the latter was his reason, Simpson's panic was at least understandable. 
Remember the sometimes breathless, tabloid-style reporting? The damaging leaks 
from anonymous police sources? The destructive quotes about Simpson from a 
therapist who had scant contact with one of the victims and who may have had a 
self-promoting agenda of her own? And worst of all, the coverage whose 
sometimes speculative tone appeared to indict Simpson even before he had been 
charged with the murders of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, 
Ronald Lyle Goldman? 
</P>
<P>
 But enough about the Los Angeles Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Do those people on television also know something about the art of speculation 
or what? There was NBC's "Today" host Bryant Gumbel on Friday morning, for 
example, trying to wring an important psycho-scoop on Simpson from psychiatrist 
Peter Breggin. Gumbel was careful, he was responsible -- assuring the shrink 
opposite him that he understood that neither of them was qualified to say 
whether O.J. Simpson was guilty or innocent. Whew! Thank goodness for that. A 
real pro, that Gumbel. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Gumbel added, "O.J.'s lawyers say he's feeling depressed, he's 
distraught. To your mind, does that indicate innocence?" At that point it was 
Gumbel's brain you were speculating about. Breggin replied that Simpson's 
sadness indicated nothing except that he was, well, sad. 
</P>
<P>
 Continuing his attempted mind-meld with his guest, Gumbel mentioned all the 
material things that Simpson had going for him, then asked: "How unlikely is it 
(that) someone with no history of extreme violence . . . would throw all that 
away in anger and rage?" 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to ignoring the "extreme violence" implicit in Simpson's 
no-contest plea to spousal battery in 1989, Gumbel was again pressing for the 
kind of long-distance, knee-jerk conjecture that television talkers are famous 
for, but that no responsible professional would indulge in. Breggin certainly 
didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, here are some more Simpson-coverage afterthoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Although not necessarily blessed with TV skills, staff specialists can pay 
big dividends when it comes to covering crime. Thus, KNBC-TV Channel 4 reporter 
Manuel Medrano -- a former Los Angeles prosecuting attorney -- was especially 
effective Friday when called upon to assess the legal ramifications of 
Simpson's attempted flight from police. Reporter Harvey Levin's experience as 
an attorney also showed Friday on KCBS-TV Channel 2, and KTTV-TV Channel 11 
benefited from having staffer Rod Bernsen, a former Los Angeles police officer, 
reporting from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 * If live coverage of the freeway chase and the subsequent surrender of 
Simpson were something to behold, other live shots were not. With time on its 
hands while waiting for Simpson to show up somewhere earlier in the day, 
Channel 4 gave Los Angeles a lingering live close-up of the door to Simpson's 
Brentwood home. And station after station went for a live close-up of the 
unoccupied podium at Parker Center where LAPD spokesman Cmdr. David J. Gascon 
would have been standing -- had he been there. 
</P>
<P>
 In fleeting quotes that are beamed across the airwaves and (reporters hope) 
quickly forgotten, moreover, there was this from Channel 2's Levin outside the 
Criminal Courts Building: "I'm getting word O.J. Simpson may be arriving here 
very soon." Levin said that at 1:03 p.m., nearly eight hours before Simpson 
would finally surrender to police in the driveway of his Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 This waiting for word on Simpson -- who the media would learn later from 
Gascon was a fugitive after reneging on a promise to turn himself in -- was 
more than merely excruciating. It was highly perilous. It's when stations 
committed to live coverage have time to fill that their anchors and reporters, 
left to their own devices, sometimes do goofy things. And Friday was no 
exception. 
</P>
<P>
 Left to twist helplessly like a shish kebab on a spit, solo Channel 4 anchor 
Chuck Henry at one point resorted to talking to himself, a la this attempted 
exchange with reporter Jim Avila deployed in the field. "Is it possible that 
O.J. could turn himself in at another location? Jim? Are you there, Jim? Jim? I 
don't suppose that could happen. We'll wait till Jim gets back on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 And here was KTLA-TV Channel 5's Ron Olsen, amid a crush of other reporters on 
a paparazzi -style Simpson watch outside the fugitive's Brentwood mansion, 
frantically responding to a car leaving the grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody's in the back! 
</P>
<P>
 'Somebody's in the back! 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't see who it is! 
</P>
<P>
 "Now they're pulling away!" 
</P>
<P>
 "No . . . that's a woman I can't identify!" 
</P>
<P>
 You had the impression that the coverage would not have differed had the 
subject been Homer Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, there was Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti responding 
defensively at a news conference to a suggestion that authorities had goofed in 
letting Simpson get away: "How many members of the media have been surrounding 
Mr. Simpson's home and he was able to get away somehow?" 
</P>
<P>
 How exotic: a top criminal justice official accusing the media of letting a 
fugitive slip through their fingers. 
</P>
<P>
 They could always plead not guilty by reason of insanity.

2ND MAN, TEEN-AGER HELD IN SLAYING OF SPORTFISHERMAN AT BIG BEAR LAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies arrested a second man and a teen-ager Saturday in 
connection with the slaying of an angler and the wounding of another during a 
robbery at Big Bear Lake this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel Gibson, 19, and a 17-year-old boy, both of Fontana, were arrested about 
12:50 a.m. The two were found asleep in a friend's apartment in Ontario, said 
Deputy Laurie Savage, a spokeswoman for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson was being held without bail at West Valley Detention Center, and the 
teen-ager was booked into San Bernardino's juvenile hall, Savage said. 
</P>
<P>
 A complaint alleging one count of murder, two counts of attempted murder and 
one count of robbery will be submitted Monday to the San Bernardino district 
attorney and juvenile authorities, the deputy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffory Paxton, 25, of Rancho Cucamonga was arrested June 10. He is being held 
in lieu of $1 million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were still trying to determine who may have been the gunman, 
Savage said. They do not expect to make more arrests. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 8 shooting occurred as four fishermen who drove up from the Los 
Angeles area were resting in their car by Boulder Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 The fishermen told deputies a man knocked on the window about 5 a.m., drew a 
gun and demanded their money. He was handed a wallet, but opened fire at the 
car. 
</P>
<P>
 Killed was Armen Shakkharamian, 47, of Montebello. He was a recent immigrant 
from Moscow. Sarkis Aylozlan, 28, of North Hollywood was recovering after 
surgery for a gunshot wound. 
</P>
<P>
 Savage said one of the other anglers was grazed by a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 Paxton is the registered owner of a 1976 Oldsmobile that crashed after the 
killing on California 18 about five miles from where the shooting occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 A wallet from one of the fishermen was found in Paxton's car, police said. A 
motorist passing the wreck gave a ride to three men before roadblocks could be 
set up, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Through interviews we were able to place Gibson and the juvenile with Paxton 
before the incident and after the incident," Savage said.

MAN PLEADS GUILTY IN SPORTS BETTING CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A convicted gambler accused of running a $1-billion-a-year sports betting ring 
from the Dominican Republic pleaded guilty to gambling charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Sacco, 51, pleaded guilty Friday to conducting an illegal gambling 
business and to making financial transactions with the profits of crime. 
</P>
<P>
 He had run the operation from the Dominican Republic since 1988, and deposited 
some of the profits at a San Francisco pawnshop, prosecutors said. He was 
arrested in September in the Dominican Republic and deported to the United 
States in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco set up the toll-free telephone lines and accepted bets on virtually all 
sporting events, prosecutors said. The FBI described it as the nation's largest 
sports betting ring. 
</P>
<P>
 Sacco, who has seven previous convictions related to illegal bookmaking and 
gambling, could get up to seven years in prison at his sentencing on Sept. 14, 
said Assistant U.S. Atty. William Schaefer.

SACRAMENTO FILE: ASSEMBLY OKS BILL OUTLAWING PRICE GOUGING AFTER A DISASTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Assembly has narrowly passed legislation to make it a misdemeanor to 
increase prices more than 10% on critical goods and services after a state of 
emergency declaration such as the one caused by the Northridge earthquake in 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 A 41-25 vote, the exact majority required, sent the measure (AB 57X) sponsored 
by Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) on to the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz said thousands of people who suffered earthquake damages were victimized 
again by some merchants who substantially hiked their prices for water, medical 
supplies and other essential items. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't stop earthquakes from shaking California," the Southern California 
lawmaker said, "but we can stop unscrupulous people from making a profit on 
tragic situations." ASSEMBLY

 Floor Action 
</P>
<P>
 * Child Molesters: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 60-4 vote a bill (AB 
2500) by Assemblywoman Barbara Alby (R-Fair Oaks) to require the state 
Department of Justice to set up a 900-prefix telephone line to allow parents to 
call in and determine if convicted felony child molesters are residing in their 
neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drivers Licenses: Passed and sent to the Senate on a 46-13 vote a bill (AB 
79X) by Assemblyman Robert C. Frazee (R-Carlsbad) to require that drivers 
convicted of drug offenses lose their licenses for six months to prevent a 
threatened loss of $54 million in federal highway funds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 'Boot Camps': Passed and sent to the Senate on a 45-27 vote a bill (AB 96X) 
by Assemblyman Tom Bates (D-Berkeley) to require "boot camps" for juvenile 
criminal offenders to include programs designed to better prepare them for 
re-entry into society, with follow-up checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Committee Action 
</P>
<P>
 * Local Elected Officials: The Governmental Organization Committee approved a 
constitutional amendment (SCA 12) that would limit the salaries of local 
elected officials to no more than the $120,000 annual salary that the governor 
is eligible to receive. Gov. Pete Wilson voluntarily takes $114,000; Los 
Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan's salary is $123,778, but he accepts only $1 per 
year. A 9-0 vote sent the measure to the Elections, Reapportionment and 
Constitutional Amendments Committee.

</P>
<P>
 * Horse Tripping: The Judiciary Committee rejected a bill (AB 49X) by 
Assemblyman John Burton (D-San Francisco) to make it a misdemeanor to 
intentionally trip a horse, a feature of Mexican-style rodeos. It received a 
5-2 vote, but six yes votes were required for approval. Reconsideration 
granted. 
</P>
<P>
 * Mountain Lions: The Natural Resources Committee rejected a bill (SB 2013) by 
Sen. Tim Leslie (R-Carnelian Bay) to allow the sport hunting of mountain lions, 
pending a vote of the people. A woman jogger recently was killed by a mountain 
lion in the Auburn Lake trails area of Northern California. A 6-4 vote was 
against the bill. Reconsideration granted. The Assembly Water, Parks and 
Wildlife Committee also rejected a similar bill (AB 3835) by Assemblyman David 
Knowles (R-Placerville) on a 5-5 tie.

ALLIES SALUTE BERLIN FOR THE LAST TIME; MILITARY: FRENCH, BRITISH AND U.S. 
TROOPS HOLD MUTED FAREWELL PARADE. DEPARTING RUSSIAN SOLDIERS WERE NOT 
INCLUDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nearly 2,000 U.S., French and British soldiers shouldered their rifles and 
marched for the last time down Berlin's monument-studded main boulevard in a 
farewell parade that provided a muted final chapter to the long saga of the 
Cold War. 
</P>
<P>
 Paratroopers made a farewell jump under a cloudy sky, a World War II-vintage 
Dakota zoomed down for a tree-level pass, and bagpipers in kilts and 
leopard-skin capes played "Scotland the Brave" as they marched past a crowd of 
applauding Berliners estimated at about 75,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "For the last 50 years, you and your comrades have been in the front line of 
defense of not only the freedom of Berlin but the freedom of Europe," Berlin 
Mayor Eberhard Diepgen told the departing soldiers. "Without your commitment, 
Berlin would not be free and Germany not united." 
</P>
<P>
 But for all the warm words, Saturday's parade lacked the trappings that marked 
military parades in Berlin at the height of the Cold War, when annual Allied 
shows of force regularly drew 200,000 people. There were no trucks, no armored 
personnel carriers, no throngs of pro-U.S. militants wildly waving the Stars 
and Stripes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have parades every year back when Germany was divided, but in 
those times, people used to seem more enthusiastic," said Peter Beblik, a 
native Berliner who came with his wife and small son to watch the parade. "Now 
people look a little bored." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor was there any triumphal march through the Brandenburg Gate -- a lofty, 
pillared structure that is the symbol of Berlin itself. And, significantly, 
there were no representatives of the departing Russian army in the parade. Even 
though the Cold War has long since been declared over, Berlin is still not 
ready to let what is left of the Red Army parade down its Strasse Des 
Siebzehnten Juni with the rest of the World War II Allies. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12,000 U.S., British and French soldiers had been stationed in Berlin in 
the years leading up to the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall, compared to the more 
than 300,000 Red Army troops stationed in East Germany. The United States, 
France and Britain began calling their soldiers home in 1990 as the old 
Communist threat faded away, and today about 3,000 of the Westerners are left. 
On Sept. 8, the last U.S. troops will pull down the American flag in a suburban 
compound and make their final departure. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd sending them off at Saturday's parade consisted mostly of 
middle-aged and elderly Germans from what used to be West Berlin -- people 
eager to express their friendship and gratitude toward the Western Allies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Americans are my friends," said Guenter Fischer, who had climbed atop a 
telephone switching post for a better view of the parade. "I was born in 1936. 
At the end of the war, the Russians occupied my neighborhood and plundered all 
of our belongings. They took away our radios, our bicycles, everything. But 
then the Americans came in with their armored vehicles. The Russians had to 
pull out, and they weren't allowed to take any of our things with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even though many in the crowd echoed Fischer's feelings of warmth and 
appreciation, no one seemed to believe that there was any point in a continued 
foreign presence in Berlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm thankful to the Allies," said Rainer Schoewe, a western Berliner who 
brought his two small children to watch Saturday's ceremonies. "But I'm not sad 
that they're leaving. They're not necessary anymore. As long as Germany was 
divided, I was happy that they were here, but now that we are together, as a 
German, I'm happy that they are leaving." 
</P>
<P>
 The only point where any bitterness arose among the onlookers was in the way 
the parade's German organizers had refused to let the Russian army take part. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, after all, the Red Army that captured Berlin in the spring of 1945, 
virtually single-handedly, and at a cost of more than 300,000 Soviet lives over 
three terrible weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 But in planning its official farewell to the Allies, the Berlin government 
initially planned to let the Western forces hold a full-fledged military parade 
-- marching through the Brandenburg Gate and all -- and excluded the Russians 
entirely, asking them to hold their own goodby party far away in the eastern 
German town of Weimar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian commander for Germany, Gen. Matvei Burlakov, complained, and the 
Germans eventually said the Russians could march in Berlin -- but not with the 
other Allies. To further soothe the Russians, the Germans scaled back the scope 
of the Western parade, dropping the symbolic Brandenburg Gate segment from the 
route. 
</P>
<P>
 The compromise, and the way it fails to acknowledge the Soviets' 1945 role as 
Berlin's liberators, has left some deeply wounded feelings, particularly on the 
part of East Germans, who believe that their part of Germany has been 
mistreated by western Germany since unification. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe I'm biased, but I don't like this," said Manfred Behrens, who traveled 
to Berlin from a small town in former East Germany to watch the Allies march. 
"East Germany didn't consist of 17 million enemies of the Russians. If all 17 
million East Germans had hated the Russians so much, there would have been a 
revolution much earlier. There are many people who just don't want to recognize 
this fact."

TERROR ENDED, ETHIOPIA STARTS OVER; AFRICA: ALMOST EVERYTHING POLITICAL HAS 
CHANGED SINCE ADDIS ABABA FELL IN MAY, 1991, TO REBELS. THIS MONTH WAS NATION'S 
FIRST FULLY FREE ELECTION.

 The little neighborhood compound known as Kebele 10 housed Ethiopia's most 
infamous prison during the military junta's reign of terror, and it was there 
that Tadele Edward decided he would most certainly succumb to the torture and 
die. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come, let me show you," he said. Tadele's back is still scarred, and he wears 
dark glasses to cover injuries suffered when his torturers tried to gouge out 
his eyes. He walked down a flight of rickety wooden steps and, under a porch 
overhang dense with cobwebs, stopped at a padlocked door that bore the words, 
"The Revolution Above All Else." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the dark, airless storage room, 600 political prisoners were once 
packed night and day like boxed matchsticks. The men who ran this place killed, 
among hundreds of others, Tadele's 19-year-old brother and tortured one woman 
so endlessly that she crawled into a septic tank to drown. The men who ran this 
place did it, they said, to build a new Ethiopia dedicated to Marxism and the 
masses. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was Kilbesa Negeo's kebele ," said Tadele, who is now chairman of the 
kebele and part of the government's efforts to sweep away 61 years of imperial 
and Marxist history and start over. "It is impossible to say how many died here 
-- doctors, lawyers, university professors, all kinds of people, but I can tell 
you Kilbesa was a man of great evil. 
</P>
<P>
 "He would come down here at night and pick out 10, 15, 20 people. It didn't 
matter who they were -- just, 'You, you and you.' He'd take them across the 
road, by the schoolhouse, and shoot them. Then their bodies would be dumped on 
the streets around Addis as a warning to others. Kilbesa, you know, is in the 
United States. We would like to get him back one day." 
</P>
<P>
 Kilbesa, in fact, was sued last year in federal district court in Atlanta by 
three Ethiopian women who said they recognized him as their torturer. The women 
won a multimillion-dollar judgment, which the U.S. Embassy in Addis Ababa said 
is under appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethiopia has asked the United States to return Kilbesa to stand trial with 
1,200 members of Mengistu Haile Mariam's deposed regime imprisoned here. But 
there is no extradition treaty between Addis Ababa and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Mengistu's revolutionary junta, known as the Dergue, was characterized between 
1974 and 1991 as much by murder as by ideology. It was centered on thousands of 
kebeles , each a sort of Marxist mini-municipality. Every kebele had its own 
defense force and controlled where its inhabitants could live, work and travel. 
Some were given specific missions. Kebele 10's mission was the elimination of 
perceived dissidents, Jehovah's Witnesses and supporters of the overthrown 
emperor, the late Haile Selassie. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the brutal oppression kebele leaders had exercised for so long, Mesfin 
Moges, 30, couldn't quite believe what had brought him to Kebele 10 at 6 a.m. 
on June 5. He had come to vote in the first fully free national election ever 
held in Ethiopia. One of the candidates was even an open sympathizer of the old 
imperial family -- a crime just four years earlier punishable by summary 
execution. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt excitement," he said, "like I was part of something important. I 
listened to all the candidates and voted for an independent. What impressed me 
about him was his honesty and willingness to work hard for Ethiopia." 
</P>
<P>
 The ballots listed 38 opposition parties, each identified by a symbol such as 
a lion, bee or tree, because 90% of the nation's 50 million people cannot read. 
When results are announced around July 1, the sole task of the 547 winners will 
be to approve a new constitution and then, sometime around February, give way 
to Ethiopia's first elected government. 
</P>
<P>
 Heading the constitutional drafting committee is the grand old man of 
Ethiopian politics, Kifle Wodajo, a foreign minister under Haile Selassie. 
</P>
<P>
 His presence, combined with the election that was monitored by observers from 
24 countries, sent an important signal to the international community that 
almost everything political in Ethiopia has changed since Addis Ababa fell in 
May, 1991, to a guerrilla army of Tigrean rebels. 
</P>
<P>
 People talk freely again, even criticizing Meles Zenawi, the transitional 
president, without fear of reprisal. No guns and only an occasional soldier are 
seen on the streets. Press censorship has ended, and the former rebels -- who 
now constitute the transitional government and the army and once spoke of 
creating an Albanian-style Communist state -- have been embraced by the West as 
pragmatic advocates of a free-market economy and of unity. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Ethiopians, though, remain uneasy. They are nervous about the 
government's plan to own all land, renting out acreage on 99-year leases, and 
its willingness to allow regions to secede and declare independence, as Eritrea 
did last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, despite all the good intentions displayed by Meles, there is in this 
land of the biblical Queen of Sheba concern that those occupying Haile 
Selassie's old palace are almost exclusively northern Tigreans. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the opposition parties shows much viability, making it likely that the 
eventual government in Ethiopia -- the only country in black Africa besides 
Liberia that was never colonized -- will resemble the transitional one. 
</P>
<P>
 That disturbs the Amhara people of central Ethiopia, whose king, Menelik II, 
forged the Ethiopian empire in the 19th Century and whose language, Amharic, 
has its own age-old alphabet -- a unique development in sub-Saharan Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 In Addis Ababa (meaning new flower in Amharic), the end of Marxism has brought 
the removal of V. I. Lenin statues and slogans that once bedecked every nook 
and cranny, but it has done little to alleviate stunning poverty or the city's 
sense of timeless misfortune. Caravans of donkeys still plod along the streets, 
their backs piled high with wheat, and beggar children sleep among the weeds in 
shantytowns that reach to the grounds of the Hilton Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ethiopia's international isolation is over. Western tourists have 
returned. Businessmen impressed with the seriousness of Meles' government 
arrive daily on flights from Europe, and the sprawling U.S. Embassy compound, 
where only a handful of Americans weathered the final years of the Mengistu 
regime, again has a full complement of diplomatic staff. 
</P>
<P>
 From 1954 until Haile Selassie's 44-year reign ended in the 1974 coup, 
Ethiopia was a client state of the United States. Washington armed and trained 
Ethiopia's army (which grew under Mengistu to be the largest in black Africa) 
and ran top-secret communications and intelligence-gathering facilities here 
staffed by Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Mengistu ended the alliance in 1977 and turned to the Soviet Union for massive 
military backing. In what had been a feudal country with landless peasants held 
in serfdom, many Ethiopians cheered the revolution. But Mengistu turned out to 
be among Africa's most coldhearted rulers. He was a man who, when informed that 
Eritrean secessionists had threatened to kidnap his wife and children, replied: 
"Go ahead. Boil them in oil for all I care."

LESSONS FROM SOMALIA APPLIED TO TEACH U.S. TROOPS HOW TO WAGE PEACE; TRAINING: 
MOCK VILLAGES AT FT. POLK LEND REALITY TO SIMULATED CONFRONTATIONS MILITARY MAY 
ENCOUNTER AS PEACEKEEPERS.

<P>
 "CARNIS VILLAGE, Republic of Cortina" -- For Army Maj. Stuart Patton, this has 
been the military equivalent of a bad hair day. 
</P>
<P>
 First his heavily armed security force failed to link up with a humanitarian 
relief convoy near this mud-bedecked "Third World" village. Then a land mine 
killed six villagers, including the wife of a local chieftain the major had 
hoped to win over. 
</P>
<P>
 And now Darren McConnell, a youthful, cocksure field agent for a private aid 
organization, is ignoring Patton's suggestion that the relief convoy stay out 
of a guerrilla-held area until the Americans can provide adequate protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Patton finds none of this pleasant. A member of a special forces unit, he has 
been trained to brook no nonsense in a combat situation. But now he is on a 
peacekeeping mission. He quietly explains the situation. Eventually, McConnell 
goes along. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident is fabricated. Only Patton and his soldiers are real. The 
villagers, the township of Carnis and the entire Republic of Cortina are all 
props in a peacekeeping exercise conducted by the Joint Readiness Training 
Center at Ft. Polk, La. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the new look in military training in the post-Cold War era. The 
services, convinced that peacekeeping is going to become a major part of their 
mission in coming years, are preparing troops to make not only war but peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Strategists are starting to use many of the lessons learned in places such as 
Somalia to get U.S. forces ready for potential peacekeeping operations in other 
areas -- possibly even Bosnia or Haiti if the Clinton Administration succeeds 
in paving the way diplomatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of Ft. Polk's sprawling woodland has been turned into mock villages where 
troops can be trained in various operations, from fending off surprise attacks 
to taking care not to run over villagers' geese with Humvees. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-run Combat Training Maneuver Center in Germany is adopting similar 
techniques to conduct training exercises for heavy-armor divisions in case the 
Administration sends peace enforcement troops to Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pentagon's joint staff published the first all-service peacekeeping 
doctrine last fall. The joint U.S. Atlantic Command is developing new training 
programs, and the Army is completing a new field manual. And all the individual 
war colleges offer courses on peace operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the services are beginning to modify some equipment for peace 
operations. The Air Force, for example, is revamping its parachute pallets for 
delivering humanitarian relief supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 By analyzing lessons learned from the U.S.-led operation in Somalia, 
strategists "are gaining a better understanding of how to tailor their forces . 
. . to respond more effectively to the challenges presented by peace 
operations," said Assistant Defense Secretary Edward L. Warner III. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally -- and perhaps most important -- the Administration itself is 
beginning to formulate a clearer policy about how it intends to use U.S. troops 
in peace operations around the globe -- a far cry from earlier months, when it 
seemed to waver on the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In early May, the White House unveiled a presidential decision directive, 
dubbed PDD-25, that sets stringent conditions on the use of U.S. forces in 
peace operations, again mostly as a result of lessons learned from the 
situations in Somalia and Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 The lessons being incorporated in the new doctrine and training policies 
include: 
</P>
<P>
 * The United States should insist on a clear chain of command under which 
military commanders are given a firm say in the operations they are asked to 
mount. Although U.S. troops might be temporarily under U.N. command, American 
officers must retain final control. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. forces must never again appear to be taking sides in a civil dispute, 
as they did when they began hunting Somali leader Mohammed Farah Aidid after 
his militia ambushed Pakistani U.N. troops last summer. The policy led to 
increased U.S. casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 * U.S. forces should not be sent into peace operations without adequate 
firepower and troops. The fact that Army Rangers were asked to hunt Aidid 
without the armor they requested was blamed by some analysts for the heavy 
casualty toll in an ill-fated Oct. 3 raid. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peacekeeping forces must be given clear rules of engagement that spell out 
when they may fire on belligerents and civilians. They need sufficient 
flexibility to enable them to defend themselves while showing restraint when 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Policy-makers and military commanders must be alert to changes in the 
original mission of a peace operation, as when U.N. forces began hunting Aidid 
in Somalia. They must make sure the troops -- and the general public -- 
understand changes thoroughly when they occur. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. strategists say peacekeeping units also need to learn narrower skills 
more effectively, such as operating checkpoints along a road, dealing with 
private relief organizations, negotiating with villagers and handling refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 Students at Ft. Polk's Joint Readiness Training Center, which trains Air Force 
and Navy commandos as well as Army troops, are put through a 12-day curriculum 
that combines practice at light-infantry combat operations with realistic 
experience in peace operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Carnis, the center has set up two other "villages" in "Cortina" and 
the neighboring country of "Atlantica" -- complete with actors playing 
villagers, tribal leaders, snipers and Cortina "national police," and a 
collection of geese, pigs, mules and goats. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the broad situations are scripted in advance, the bulk of the 
interplay between the soldiers and the villagers is free-form. As a result, no 
one knows when a "terrorist" is going to throw a grenade. An ill-timed remark 
by an infantryman could start a revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 The exercises, carefully monitored by on-the-scene observers and enhanced by 
electronic devices that beep when a participant has been "killed" by a land 
mine or rifle fire, are followed by after-action critiques in which a unit's 
mistakes are reviewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of it is just plain common sense," said James B. Williams, technical 
leader for BDM Management Services Co., a consulting firm that puts together 
the role-playing operation for the Army. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, the mistakes -- by far the school's best teaching tool -- are 
legion. A few days ago, soldiers driving through a "contaminated" area donned 
protective masks but did not provide them for their civilian passengers, who 
"died" on the way to their destination. 
</P>
<P>
 In another incident, a failure to listen to warnings from local villagers led 
two U.S. convoys into an "ambush" by opposing forces, who are played -- with a 
vengeance -- by Army troops stationed permanently at Ft. Polk. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the most realistic wartime scenario we will ever play," 
Patton said as his unit helped make sure that the "bodies" of villagers 
"killed" by that day's mine blasts are respectfully loaded onto trucks for 
transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The quickest way to get thrown out of a country is to anger the people who 
live in it," he said. "This teaches us to react to various situations. You can 
learn those lessons here without paying the price." 
</P>
<P>
 Canadian army Capt. John Errington, who recently returned from deployment with 
U.N. forces in Bosnia, agrees. "The potential is all here," he said of the 
course at Ft. Polk. If the United States does send troops to Bosnia, "every 
unit ought to go through here." 
</P>
<P>
 Army Lt. Col. Jack Clarke, a military analyst at the Army's Training and 
Doctrine Command in Norfolk, Va., and one of the authors of a new field manual 
on peace operations, warns that the curriculum must be kept general in order to 
keep troops prepared for all situations. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are valuable lessons to be learned from Somalia, but we also want to be 
careful not to look at all peacekeeping operations through that same lens," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The difficulty is that, despite the new presidential directive, the 
Administration still has not spelled out precisely when and how it plans to use 
U.S. forces for peacekeeping operations in other areas of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 During the 1992 presidential campaign, President Clinton unveiled an ambitious 
proposal to establish an international army, including some U.S. troops, that 
would be ready to stand "at the borders of countries threatened by aggression," 
preventing mass violence. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Administration's inability to work out a firm policy in Bosnia, 
combined with the Oct. 3 raid in Somalia, in which 18 Rangers were killed, 
clipped the Administration's enthusiasm for peace operations and forced it to 
scale back its plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The new White House directive rejects suggestions that the United States 
support a standing U.N. army, or even that it earmark specific U.S. military 
units for participation in U.N. operations. It also concludes that Washington 
is spending too much on peacekeeping worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 White House caution in approving U.N. military operations in Rwanda prompted 
the U.N. Security Council to put off a proposal for dispatching 5,500 more 
troops to that country earlier this month, the first such impact from PDD-25 
since the new policy was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the White House has pledged that it will send U.S. troops to Bosnia 
to help enforce any new peace accord there, it has laid down so many strict 
conditions that some analysts say it makes the prospect of using U.S. forces 
there anything but a certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Many U.S. officials say they now believe that, given the adverse reaction to 
the Oct. 3 firefight in Somalia, the United States would be better off 
providing logistic support and intelligence for peace operations, leaving 
ground fighting to other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Col. Sam Thompson, operations commander at the Ft. Polk training 
center, argues that even with all their training, U.S. forces may be better 
geared to securing an area initially -- as they did in Somalia -- than to 
enforcing the peace, which takes more patience. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just not by nature very well-suited for these other things," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, most analysts agree that preparation for peace operations will 
continue to be a mainstay of the post-Cold War military, along with maintaining 
conventional combat readiness and improving U.S. capability to counterattacks 
by weapons of mass destruction.

CLINTON TO ANSWER JONES' SUIT WITH HIGH-RISK LEGAL STRATEGY; LAW: AN ELABORATE 
MOTION TO DISMISS SEEKS TO AVOID ANY DETAILED RESPONSE TO SEX HARASSMENT 
CHARGES. FAILURE COULD MEAN A HUMILIATING TRIAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In their rebuttal to the sexual harassment charges filed by former Arkansas 
employee Paula Corbin Jones, President Clinton's attorneys intend to summon the 
support of some powerful historical allies: John Quincy Adams, Thomas Jefferson 
and Richard Nixon. 
</P>
<P>
 By invoking the names of these former presidents, each of whom helped to 
define the legal prerogatives of the presidency, the President and his advisers 
hope to persuade the courts to dramatically expand a long-observed principle 
that has shielded presidents from civil litigation while they are in the White 
House. 
</P>
<P>
 This high-risk legal maneuver will be the centerpiece of an elaborate motion 
for dismissal that the President plans to file with the court this week in 
response to Jones' suit, according to Clinton's advisers. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Susan Webber Wright, who coincidentally was a 
constitutional law student of Clinton's at the University of Arkansas in 
Fayetteville, is expected to rule on the issue shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 If Clinton's legal strategy succeeds, he could be spared the embarrassment of 
responding in detail to Jones' allegations that as governor of Arkansas he 
tried to entice her into a sexual liaison in a Little Rock hotel room in May, 
1991. In addition, he would succeed in charting a new legal prerogative for 
himself and all future presidents. 
</P>
<P>
 But if it fails, his advisers concede, he almost certainly would be forced to 
endure a humiliating court trial that would focus national attention on his 
sexual habits. A ruling in Jones' favor could also be a serious blow to the 
institution of the presidency, making it more vulnerable to political attack 
through the judicial system. 
</P>
<P>
 By claiming presidential immunity from civil litigation, Clinton's legal 
advisers hope to persuade Wright to dismiss Jones' suit without hearing any 
testimony on her sensational allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 At minimum, if Wright agrees to hear arguments on the immunity issue before 
proceeding with the substance of the case, the dispute over presidential 
prerogatives could delay hearings on the complaint for months -- or years -- 
especially if both sides are inclined to carry their battle all the way up to 
the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 40-minute telephone conference call last week between Wright and 
attorneys in the case, the judge gave Clinton's lead attorney, Robert S. 
Bennett, 10 days to file a memorandum supporting his request to handle the 
immunity issue first. Jones' lawyers will then have another 10 days to respond 
to Bennett's argument. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Atty. Gen. Janet Reno has asked Solicitor General Drew S. Days III 
and Acting Associate Atty. Gen. William C. Bryson to recommend how the Justice 
Department should approach the sensitive issue of presidential immunity. It is 
likely the Justice Department will file a brief supporting Clinton's claim of 
presidential immunity. 
</P>
<P>
 In her vividly descriptive suit filed in early May, Jones, a former 
$6.35-an-hour employee of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission, 
alleged that three years earlier Clinton lured her into a Little Rock hotel 
room and asked her to perform oral sex. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton insists he has no recollection of meeting Jones, and his defenders are 
known to have witnesses who will testify that Jones did nothing more than shake 
hands with the governor that day. 
</P>
<P>
 As many lawyers see it, Jones' sexual harassment case is deficient in a number 
of respects. Not only did she file her suit after the statute of limitations 
had expired under the most pertinent laws, but she has not yet substantiated 
her claim that she suffered retribution in her job after refusing Clinton's 
alleged sexual overtures. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Jones acknowledged in an interview last week that she received several 
raises after the incident but insisted they were not comparable to those 
awarded her peers. 
</P>
<P>
 Complainants in sexual harassment suits usually are required by the court to 
establish that they worked in a sexually hostile environment. Or they must 
establish a link between the harassment and their treatment on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the apparent weaknesses of her complaint in that regard, however, 
sources said Clinton's advisers have told him that Wright is unlikely to 
dismiss the complaint simply on those grounds. 
</P>
<P>
 And if the judge begins hearing testimony in the case, they have predicted, 
the President could be forced to present graphic evidence in court to disprove 
Jones' contention that she saw "distinguishing characteristics in Clinton's 
genital area" -- much as music star Michael Jackson was forced to do in 
response to a sexual abuse complaint filed against him by an unidentified boy. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, Clinton's advisers have concluded that a trial on the merits of 
the case must be avoided, even if they feel confident of a favorable outcome. 
That is the reason Clinton's lawyers are depending so heavily on their claim of 
presidential immunity to win dismissal before a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Under current law, there is no doubt that presidents are immune from any 
litigation relating to their official duties. The precedent was established in 
a U.S. Supreme Court decision in 1982 involving a suit filed against Nixon by 
government whistle-blower Ernie Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ruling is silent on suits such as Jones' that deal with matters beyond 
the purview of a President's official duties. Herbert J. Miller Jr., a veteran 
Washington attorney who argued Nixon vs. Fitzgerald on behalf of the late 
President, said the ruling does not provide a solid precedent for Clinton's 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the Nixon case is a firm precedent for granting the present 
President immunity for pre-presidential conduct," Miller said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones' attorneys, Gilbert K. Davis and Joseph Camaratta, said they will assert 
that the decision in Nixon vs. Fitzgerald has no bearing on their complaint 
because an encounter with Jones would be unrelated to his presidential duties. 
</P>
<P>
 But those representing the President are prepared to argue that Jones' suit 
would divert the President's attention from governing, just as the Fitzgerald 
complaint would have distracted Nixon had it been allowed to proceed. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting from Adams and Jefferson, the President's lawyers are certain to argue 
that the nature of the presidency requires the courts to reject such suits, 
sources said. Adams wrote that subjecting a President to lawsuits would violate 
the separation of powers by giving the courts authority over him. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton's immunity against Jones' suit should last only as long as he is 
President, his lawyers will argue. If Jones wants to refile it after he leaves 
the White House, nothing should prevent it, in their view. 
</P>
<P>
 Another citation likely to show up in the President's legal brief: the 
Soldiers and Sailors Civil Relief Act of 1940, which protects servicemen from 
liability while they are acting in the line of duty. If such protection belongs 
to a lowly soldier, Clinton's lawyers believe, it belongs to the commander in 
chief as well. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the central points that the President's lawyers are likely to raise has 
more to do with politics than law. They are certain to note that Jones was 
first introduced to the national press earlier this year at a news conference 
staged by Clinton's conservative critics. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jones is permitted to sue the President, one Clinton adviser mused, "isn't 
this going to be the next partisan tactic to be used in an era of partisan 
annihilation?"

 Travel agent Carole Thebaud can only guess what effect the impending cutoff of 
U.S. air traffic and large cash transfers to Haiti will have on restoring

 Days away from the start of new Clinton Administration measures designed to 
increase the pressure on Haiti's military government, Thebaud said: "I'm barely 
surviving. This should be our high season right now. But look. There's no one 
in here. Because all available flights out of Haiti are sold out." 
</P>
<P>
 Thebaud, whose small storefront business is in the heart of Miami's Little 
Haiti, is just one of thousands of Haitians in the United States, most of them 
in South Florida and New York, being squeezed by the U.S. effort to tighten the 
screws on the leaders of the military coup that ousted democratically elected 
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Saturday, all commercial flights between the United States and Haiti 
will end and cash transfers between the two nations will be limited to $50 a 
month. The targets of the stepped-up sanctions, announced by President Clinton 
June 10, are the coup leaders and their wealthy supporters. Last week, U.S. 
officials reported seeing signs that an embargo put in place earlier is 
beginning to work and that a military invasion of Haiti seems less likely. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to those on the streets of Miami's vibrant, Creole-speaking 
neighborhoods, the embargo is hurting those outside Haiti too. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the embargo is a cruel thing," said Joseph Pierre, director of the 
Caribbean Marketplace, where several vendors rent space in a tin-roofed 
warehouse. "This is killing business in Little Haiti. We are down to six 
tenants, and, if the embargo continues, all will close." 
</P>
<P>
 Many import-export businesses, and the once-brisk overseas freighter traffic 
between Miami and Port-au-Prince, have been shut down since May, when a 
hemispheric economic embargo was broadened to include all but humanitarian 
shipments. Several small Haitian cargo boats now sit idle in the Miami River. 
</P>
<P>
 Thebaud, whose business was based almost solely on booking flights to Haiti, 
suddenly has nothing to sell. Although American Airlines added flights between 
the United States and Haiti after the ban was announced, all seats out of Haiti 
were snapped up within hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can get you to Haiti," said Thebaud, "but I can't get you a flight out." 
</P>
<P>
 The run on flights out of Haiti has left many Haitians in Miami unable to 
attend to family or business affairs there. Moreover, many Haitians with visas 
for the United States cannot find a way out of their country. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami attorney Cheryl Little said she has asked the White House to provide 
special charters for several children, dependents of U.S. residents, who have 
visas but no way to get to this country. 
</P>
<P>
 Across 54th Street from Thebaud's office, Fred St. Amand was busy. Half a 
dozen people, some with cash in hand, waited in line at his Valparaiso United 
Services to transfer money to relatives in Haiti before the deadline. Said 
Antoine Jean, 50, a liquor warehouse worker who had just wired $100 to his four 
children in Cape Haitien: "I do this every week." 
</P>
<P>
 So what will happen after Saturday when his family's monthly stipend drops 
from $400 to a maximum of $50? Jean grimaced and shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Amand fears the worst. "I think there is a potential for violence, here 
and in Haiti," he said. "What do you think is going to happen when a man in 
Miami gets a call from his wife, and she says: 'Honey, I'm starving to death. I 
have no money, and there is nothing in the markets. What are you going to do?' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Embassy officials in Haiti have estimated that about 15% of the country's 
residents are dependent on money or other goods sent regularly from the United 
States. St. Amand says that figure is too low. He said his agency, one of many 
in Miami, transfers up to $200,000 a month to Haiti in amounts that average 
about $100 a week per customer. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion, I think most people are having second thoughts on the 
embargo," St. Amand said. "Now they are saying: 'Your kids won't be able to 
eat, and you can't travel to see them.' People feel confused." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, in a city where support for Aristide has long been fervent and 
near-universal, it is not uncommon now to hear criticism of the soft-spoken 
Roman Catholic priest. "Aristide is a good guy but I question whether he is the 
right person for the country now," said Philip Dierre of the Haitian Task 
Force, a business development group. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Joseph Pierre: "Why should we squeeze the people down there, while 
Aristide is living well here?" 
</P>
<P>
 Little, an attorney for Florida Rural Legal Services, insisted that support 
for Aristide is still strong in Little Haiti. But, she added, "people are 
becoming extremely frustrated. So little seems to have been accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "The embargo has been hurting the poor because it has not been strictly 
enforced. The rich have been able to go around it, to get goods they need 
through the black market, while the military has been making a fortune off of 
it. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the embargo is enforced, and it means the return of Aristide, then people 
are for it." 
</P>
<P>
 William H. Gray III, President Clinton's special adviser on Haiti, has 
rejected the idea that the new sanctions would hurt the average Haitian. At the 
same time, he said the Administration would increase its $70-million-a-year 
humanitarian aid program to Haiti to add about 300,000 more people to the 1 
million now being fed.

SETTLEMENT ENDS 2-DAY STRIKE ON LONG ISLAND COMMUTER LINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A nearly 2-day-old strike at the nation's largest commuter railroad was 
settled Saturday night, officials announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Island Rail Road trains are expected to be running on time for Monday 
morning's rush hour, Metropolitan Transportation Authority head Peter Stangl 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no concession on the work rules and we paid the ransom," Stangl 
said. "I made the decision that I would pay the ransom before it got bad out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Stangl, federal mediator Ernest DuBester and union chairman Ed Yule announced 
the resolution at a news conference Saturday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Union leaders agreed to a three-year contract that will expire at the end of 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 It provides for retroactive raises of 2.5%, 2.5% and 3.5% per year with no 
work-rule changes, said Sam Zambuto, a spokesman for the LIRR. 
</P>
<P>
 The raises will be compounded so that the total pay increase for workers will 
be 8.7% for the three-year period ending in December, Zambuto added. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,300 conductors, track workers and motormen struck shortly after 
midnight Friday when talks broke off in the 2 1/2-year contract dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Management had offered a 12% wage increase over four years; the United 
Transportation Union had wanted a 17% raise. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Mario M. Cuomo served as a go-between during the negotiations. On 
Saturday, he urged the two sides to reach an agreement, saying the 
inconvenience to riders outweighed the issues being fought over. 
</P>
<P>
 The LIRR is the nation's largest commuter railroad, with 254,000 average 
weekday fares. Most come from the 103,000 people who ride in and out of New 
York City during rush hours.

PLANE CARRYING MEXICO SOCCER FANS CRASHES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A plane chartered in Mexico crashed while approaching Dulles International 
Airport in a heavy fog Saturday, killing all 12 people aboard, U.S. officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl W. Vogt, chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board, said the 
Lear jet had missed one approach to the airport and was attempting a second 
when it went down in a heavily wooded area on Dulles property. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no sense that anyone lived. There's no one alive," Vogt said at an 
afternoon news briefing at the airport. "The bodies are being taken out of the 
wreckage at this time." 
</P>
<P>
 A makeshift morgue was set up nearby, and the bodies were to be transported to 
a Virginia medical examiner's facility in northern Virginia, police spokesmen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Henonin, a spokesman for the private, commercial chartering company TAESA 
in Mexico City, said the plane was an Executive Learjet with two crewmen and 10 
passengers. He said the passengers were headed to Washington for World Cup 
soccer. The first-round match between Norway and Mexico was slated for today at 
Robert F. Kennedy Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Police and rescue workers with dogs combed the wreckage area, about four miles 
south of the airport's main terminal. Bulldozers had to be brought in to clear 
a path for rescue teams. 
</P>
<P>
 NTSB officials said there was no sign of fire at the time of the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogt said NTSB investigators would probably remain at the scene for at least 
three days. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will be conducting an on-site investigation," he said. Vogt told reporters 
that information available to U.S. officials was sketchy, adding, "I am not 
going to speculate about what happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Henonin said the flight originated in Mexico City, bound for Dulles, with a 
stop in New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 Vogt said the plane arrived in Chantilly about 6 a.m. EDT, was put in a 
20-minute holding pattern by Dulles controllers and then attempted a landing. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a missed approach," he said. "It went around and tried a second 
approach" and crashed.

JIM MURRAY: A TRIAL HORSE OF ANOTHER COLOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM MURRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bert Cooper is what the fight mob calls a "trial horse." A trial horse is a 
guy who hits hard -- but not too hard. He can box -- but he's no Willie Pep.  
</P>
<P>
 He can "take it." English translation: He has an infinite capacity for 
personal suffering. But by the same token, he has to take it. He has to be easy 
to hit.  
</P>
<P>
 He's a kind of pugilistic litmus paper. You measure the acidity of a 
"contender" by his performance against a Bert Cooper. When Marlon Brando 
lamented, "I coulda been a contenduh!" in the flick, "On the Waterfront," he 
was articulating the lament of trial horses everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial horse never becomes a contender. His job is to create contenders, make 
the other guy the contender.  
</P>
<P>
 Trial horses never get title shots. They are always below the title. They are 
main-eventers, but the other guy is always the main attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper even looks like a trial horse. He has this big, gleaming gold tooth in 
the center of his mouth. He looks a little like Mike Tyson. Until the bell 
rings. Then, the resemblance ends. 
</P>
<P>
 In the old days, a fighter such as Johnny Risko was a heavyweight trial horse. 
His nickname was the "Cleveland Rubber Man," which tells you all you have to 
know about him. You could put him down. But not out. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper is nobody's rubber man. Porcelain man is more like it. Like Risko, he 
gets up. But there are nights you could make teacups out of his chin. His jaw 
is definitely not rubber then. His legs are. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that Cooper isn't durable. In a way, he's as indestructible as the 
Rock of Gibraltar. He has been knocked out no fewer than nine times in his 
career, which is 45 fights long. On the other hand, he has knocked out 27 
himself. He has no trouble getting another main event, another horse to try. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper may be the last of the breed. The trial horse may become as extinct as 
the buggy whip. In fact, Cooper almost left the ranks himself. Here is what 
happened: On Nov. 23, 1991, he got a title shot against Evander Holyfield, who 
didn't need a trial, just a warm-up.  
</P>
<P>
 Let the record show that Cooper flattened Holyfield with an overhand right in 
the third round. And only an overzealous referee (Mills Lane, imported for the 
fight from Nevada) saved Holyfield, in Cooper's view. "He gave him a standing 
eight-count, which is supposed to be waived in a title fight," Cooper protests. 
</P>
<P>
 The official record book shows that Holyfield rallied to win on a 
seventh-round knockout, but Cooper complains that his whole career has been 
marred by incomplete statistics like that. "It don't show I would have won if 
he don't get no standing eight," he maintains. "I came that close to 45 million 
dollars." 
</P>
<P>
 But Cooper, so to speak, rolls with the punches. A trial horse doesn't have 
time to brood. He has to go on and make character for the next heavyweight 
hopeful. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, he louses up the script, makes them fail the test. He derailed 
Willie De Wit, the Canadian hopeful, in mid-career. Turned him into Willie De 
Half Wit, to hear Cooper tell it. "Stopped him in two in his hometown," Cooper 
boasts proudly. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper also road-blocked Henry Tillman on his way to the big money. It's 
Cooper's job to turn the prospects into suspects if he can. And sometimes he 
can. 
</P>
<P>
 It is Cooper's view that he would be undisputed heavyweight champion of the 
world today if it weren't for a series of lousy breaks. A trial horse, he 
points out, never gets any split decisions. If it's that close, the nod goes to 
the hero. Trial horses get decisions only when they would have to wake up the 
opponent to tell him he won. 
</P>
<P>
 A trial horse never gets the luxury of signing for a fight months in advance 
and going to training camp for weeks before the bout. A trial horse gets a 
phone call asking him if he's going to be doing anything Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 He got the Holyfield fight on five days' notice. "He was going to fight the 
Italian champion and the guy backed out. They gave the fight to me. I just had 
time to shave and catch the plane to Atlanta." 
</P>
<P>
 He also took a Michael Moorer fight on short notice. Moorer is the current 
heavyweight champion, a title he took from Holyfield, but when he fought his 
trial horse, Cooper, in May 1992, Bert put him down twice in the first round. 
"The referee give it that 'one-two, buckle-my-shoe' count," Cooper sniffs. "He 
kept pushing me to a neutral corner and not picking up the count. After that, I 
just got tired. I was in no kinda shape. But I can beat Moorer. He drinks." 
</P>
<P>
 So, of course, does Cooper. He admits he seldom is in the athletic pink of 
condition. Trial horses seldom are. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper thinks if he ever could get in condition, he'd make the world forget 
the Joe Louises and the Muhammad Alis and all the Sugar Rays put together. 
Rocky Balboa would be he. 
</P>
<P>
 Take the George Foreman fight. Foreman was one of the half-dozen present or 
past champions Cooper has battled. For once, Cooper had plenty of time to get 
ready for the fight. That was just the trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial horses are supposed to be vulnerable to certain types of offenses. An 
Ali rope-a-dope, a hook-off-the-jab. A sucker for the straight right. But 
Foreman's camp perceived another flaw in Cooper's defenses. He was a sucker for 
a dame. One of Foreman's camp undertook to fill the blank spaces in Cooper's 
days -- and nights -- with pliant ladies of the evening. Cooper practiced his 
footwork in discos, not gyms. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, his diet was catered to. Most fighters' diets include a large proportion 
of heads of lettuce. Cooper's heads were on mugs of beer. They even provided 
him with champagne. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper wasn't happy climbing out of the ring -- Foreman knocked him out in two 
-- but he didn't have a care in the world climbing in. Foreman backers had 
taken care of the inner man, Cooper admits. Instead of working on the heavy 
bag, he worked on the heavy drinking. As Satchel Paige said, "The social ramble 
ain't restful." 
</P>
<P>
 You can see the life of a trial horse ain't easy. But even though he got 
stopped in two by another champion, Riddick Bowe, Bert Cooper whipped contender 
Ray Mercer -- in fact, broke his jaw in the fight before. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, 28, intends to become a horse of another color. "I'm not gettin' no 
younger," he says. "I'm startin' to get serious now. I don't drink nothin' 
stronger'n Gatorade. I go to bed early and get up and run five miles. When I 
got up to 248 pounds, (ex-champion) Joe Frazier said to me, 'You ought to be 
ashamed of yourself. You coulda been champ.' I took it to heart. Now, look at 
me! I'm down to 226." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper meets Jeremy Williams, a young comer (16-1) in the heavyweight ranks, 
Friday at the Olympic Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper intends to turn Williams into the trial horse. He plans to be the 
contender, or the trial horse you can lead to water and make him drink it.

U.S. OPEN; FOREIGN INVASION AT OAKMONT; GOLF: SOUTH AFRICAN ELS IS TWO-STROKE 
LEADER OVER NEW ZEALANDER NOBILO AFTER SHOOTING A THIRD-ROUND 66. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS BONK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So what happened to bad, bad Oakmont? 
</P>
<P>
 The course that was supposed to be harder than the head of a sand wedge, 
golf's final exam -- well, it has been more like an open-book test for the best 
golfers in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 As for North American golfers, let's just say they're going to have to come 
from behind if they're going to catch South African Ernie Els or New Zealander 
Frank Nobilo and win the U.S. Open today at pussycat Oakmont Country Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Els toured the front nine in a record-tying 30 on his way to a 66, a 72-hole 
total of seven-under-par 206, and a two-shot lead over Nobilo, who had a 68 on 
a day when the U.S. Open turned into what amounted to a foreign tourist 
attraction. 
</P>
<P>
 The closest Americans are Tom Watson, Hale Irwin and Loren Roberts, in a group 
at 209 with second-round leader Colin Montgomerie of Scotland, one shot behind 
Nobilo and three behind Els. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson rebounded from Friday's 73 with a 68 and said he helped himself by 
practicing putting on the floor of his living room. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said there are many with hopes of winning. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd say anybody within even par will have a chance," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 It might not be an American. There have been only three foreigners who have 
won the U.S. Open since 1927 and none in 13 years, but that might change today. 
At least Els hopes so. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel pretty good, obviously," he said. "What can I say?" 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't need to say much Saturday at Oakmont, which gave up 182 birdies and 
four eagles to 65 golfers. For the third day in a row, the average score went 
down, from 75.2 to 73.42 to 73.40. 
</P>
<P>
 Next thing you know, they're going to have to start limiting birdies. This 
isn't what anybody expected at Oakmont, especially Watson, who had predicted 
more scores in the 90s than in the 60s. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he ever wrong. So far, there have been 30 scores in the 60s and none in 
the 90s. 
</P>
<P>
 Watson said the scoring has been good because the humidity has been high and 
kept the greens from drying out. So if you're going to pin the blame, Watson 
said he knows where it should go. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mother nature," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Els needs to keep the ball in the fairway, make some putts and he might win 
his first major title. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Els, 24, had three birdies and an eagle on the first five holes. 
By then, he knew he was up to something special. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'This is just happening for me,' " he said. "I was up there, you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Els started at two under and took the lead from Montgomerie when the Scot 
bogeyed No. 5 and Els two-putted from 25 feet for birdie at No. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 Els slipped up on No. 10, when he three-putted after a weak chip and 
double-bogeyed, but Montgomerie fell back with four bogeys on the back nine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still in it, sure," Montgomerie said. "I've never backed away from a 
challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Nobilo is not exactly a household name in the United States, mainly because he 
has played one regular PGA Tour event in two years. But he is a fixture on the 
European tour. 
</P>
<P>
 With the chance to win his first major title, Nobilo said he is probably going 
to be nervous from the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are not human if you don't feel it," he said. "But I don't get a chance 
to play in a U.S. Open every day, so I feel I have something to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, that is the overriding factor. Maybe with three holes to go, it 
might be a different kettle of fish." 
</P>
<P>
 Irwin's 71 could have been better, but the three-time Open winner isn't going 
to jump in a bunker and cover himself with sand. 
</P>
<P>
 It would have been an exceptional round if Irwin had a little more luck at No. 
18. His hand slipped on his driver and he wound up with a double-bogey six. 
</P>
<P>
 At three strokes back, Irwin is in a familiar territory. He was four shots 
behind Mike Donald in the 1990 Open at Medinah, but tied him with a final-round 
67 and won the playoff the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 Could it happen again?  
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to really play well," he said. "It's not that I'm that far behind; 
it's that I've got that many more guys to go through to get there tomorrow." 
</P>
<P>
 All it took for Roberts to leap into contention was to shoot 64 in a tidy 
round marked by seven birdie putts, the longest a 60-footer on the par-three 
16th. 
</P>
<P>
 A 39-year-old from Memphis who went to Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, Roberts won 
the Nestle Invitational this year and tied for fifth at the Masters, but missed 
the cut last week at Westchester. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts figures he might just have a chance today, based on what kind of 
temperament works at the Open. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always figured this is a good tournament for me," he said. "I am a patient 
player, a monotonous player, you might say, methodical." 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis Strange completed his third consecutive round of 70, which might be 
considered sort of monotonous if it weren't so potentially rewarding. Strange 
is at 210 along with Steve Lowery, four shots behind Els. 
</P>
<P>
 Strange, who won the U.S. Open in 1988 and 1989, said he sees similarities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm playing as well as I did the second time that I won," he said. "I've kind 
of moseyed along and done my business and hung in there, but I haven't hit a 
good spell of four or five holes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully better later than never." 
</P>
<P>
 Greg Norman, Steve Pate and John Cook are at 211. Norman's 69 was his first 
sub-par round and couldn't have come at a better time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not thinking about tomorrow," he said. "We'll have to see the way (the 
leaders) finish. . . . If everybody says the same, 66 might be a good score to 
shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 The way things are going at Oakmont, 66 might not be enough. U.S. Open Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The cut was late in coming, but some big names didn't escape it anyway. 
Lightning in the area Friday night forced postponement of the second round with 
18 golfers on the course and that delayed the cut until Saturday morning. It 
turned out to be 147, five over par. Among those who didn't make the cut were 
Nick Price, Nick Faldo, Larry Nelson, Lee Janzen, David Frost, Larry Mize, 
Payne Stewart, Jose Maria Olazabal, Corey Pavin and John Daly. . . . Rocco 
Mediate shot 79, then withdrew because of a bad back. Mediate was sidelined for 
four months before returning last week to play the Buick Classic.

MIKE DOWNEY: AS IN THE PAST, AN O.J. RUN THAT IS BEYOND BELIEF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By MIKE DOWNEY

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I am watching a television set from the doorway of a cocktail lounge. The TV 
is small and the picture is poor. I cannot get any closer to it. The airport is 
teeming with weekend travelers, dozens of whom are huddled in this doorway with 
me, transfixed. Police cars are pursuing a vehicle on television. O.J. Simpson 
is inside the vehicle, with a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 I rub my face with my palms. I am not seeing this. I am hallucinating. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where is he?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The 405." 
</P>
<P>
 "What's that sign say?" 
</P>
<P>
 "GO, JUICE." 
</P>
<P>
 My fingers press against my temples. I am not hearing this. I am dreaming. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wrote a letter." 
</P>
<P>
 "What did it say?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That he didn't do it." 
</P>
<P>
 My jaw sways side to side. No, no, no. This is not happening. 
</P>
<P>
 "What else?" 
</P>
<P>
 "That he can't go on." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is he running?" 
</P>
<P>
 "To see his mother." 
</P>
<P>
 I squint at the TV. The truck in front is going slowly. O.J. Simpson, a man I 
so admire, is crouched in back, a fugitive. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's driving the truck?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Al Cowlings." 
</P>
<P>
 "The old USC football player?" 
</P>
<P>
 "He helped O.J. escape." 
</P>
<P>
 I have passed some shockproof point. Every word I hear is more eerie than the 
last. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where were the cops?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Not there, I guess." 
</P>
<P>
 "After a double-murder?" 
</P>
<P>
 "They let him turn himself in." 
</P>
<P>
 I am listening to a radio now. My friend Jim Hill is on, the sportscaster. He 
is not talking to an audience. He is talking to O.J. and Al. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't do this. O.J.? Al? 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't run away from this. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can hear me, guys, stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please stop." 
</P>
<P>
 I call someone in L.A., watching TV. My friend Vince Evans is on, the 
quarterback. He is not being interviewed. He is talking to O.J. and Al. 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J., please stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't the thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, please, stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "We love you, man." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask for O.J.'s letter to be read. Why is Nicole Brown Simpson dead? Why is 
Ronald Lyle Goldman dead? 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone understand. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have nothing to do with Nicole's murder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I loved her, 
</P>
<P>
 "Always have and always will." 
</P>
<P>
 I ask how he wrote this. On a yellow legal pad, I am told. I am trying to 
picture this man writing this letter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe what is being said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of it is totally made up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, please, please, 
</P>
<P>
 "Leave my children in peace." 
</P>
<P>
 I feel a flutter in my heart. I know not what to make of this -- pathetic or 
sympathetic? I ask how the letter ends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always tried to be up and helpful. 
</P>
<P>
 "So why is this happening? 
</P>
<P>
 "Please think of the real O.J. 
</P>
<P>
 "And not this lost person." 
</P>
<P>
 I am thinking, thinking, thinking. I want so much to believe. To say: Say it 
ain't so, O.J. Say it ain't so. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave himself up." 
</P>
<P>
 "What?" 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. Simpson surrendered." 
</P>
<P>
 "Where?" 
</P>
<P>
 I am listening to this conversation. My eyelids close in thankfulness. I do 
not care how or where. Thank God no more blood has been shed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They took him into custody." 
</P>
<P>
 "With a gun?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a photo of his family." 
</P>
<P>
 It is Friday, June 17, 1994. It is very, very late. I am very, very tired. 
</P>
<P>
 I go to bed. I try to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot.

BLUSTER OR LUSTER?; JURY'S OUT ON WHETHER BRASH NEW COMMISSIONER BILL DONER 
WILL INJECT NEW LIFE INTO HYDROPLANE, BUT HE PROMISES WILD BID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Shock treatment is sometimes used as a last resort to get a person's heart 
going again when he's at death's door. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlimited hydroplane racing may not be dying but it has certainly been wobbly 
the last few seasons. So it opted for shock treatment when it hired Bill Doner 
as its new commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Doner? 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, the same brash, fast-talking, arm-waving maverick promoter from Orange 
County who filled the stands for drag racing at Irvine and Irwindale with such 
outrageous stunts as Fox Hunt night, where female-ogling was as much a part of 
the scene as top-fuel dragsters and funny cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The same Bill Doner who was flushed out of a fishing village at Cabo San Lucas 
by a headhunting organization to become vice president of marketing at Caesars 
Palace, where he promoted the Sugar Ray Leonard-Marvin Hagler fight and Rolling 
Stones concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 The same big, blustering redhead who was sports editor of the Orange Coast 
Daily Pilot in Costa Mesa right out of college before moving to Seattle, where 
he established a West Coast drag-racing dynasty that included Orange County 
Raceway and Irwindale Dragstrip. 
</P>
<P>
 It was his work in taking seven drag strips, all either in bankruptcy or 
nearly so, and making them profitable that caught the attention of the Caesars 
Palace recruiters. 
</P>
<P>
 No shrinking violet, Doner said when he was introduced as commissioner of the 
Unlimited Racing Commission of the American Power Boat Assn.: 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like Jack Nicholson (as the Joker) in Batman when he comes in and 
says, 'Wait'll you get a load of me.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He took over April 1 from Don Jones, a 10-year veteran forced out in a palace 
revolt at Seattle headquarters. From Jones' boardroom-like administration, 
Doner has brought a helter-skelter, shoot-from-the-hip-and-ask-questions-later 
approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, this sport has nowhere to go but up, and it had better get going in a 
hurry if it's going anywhere," Doner said after presiding over his first two 
events, the APBA Gold Cup on the Detroit River and the Texas Hydrofest last 
Sunday near Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need more boats, more races, more sponsors, more of just about everything, 
including enthusiasm. I'm pumped up for what the future can hold, and I want 
all these people to get pumped up, too. We're going for a ride, a wild one if I 
have anything to do with it." 
</P>
<P>
 Doner, 55, didn't seek the job. He was happily living in Seattle, helping run 
the Vancouver Indy car race, preparing to install 65,000 seats for the 
Commonwealth Games in Victoria, Canada -- including a box for the Queen -- and 
putting together a marketing company for recreational vehicle parks in the 
Pacific Northwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was on my way home from a fishing trip to Australia last October and 
stopped off in Honolulu to watch the last unlimited race of the year," he said. 
"It was terrible. I told (boat owner and long-time friend) Steve Woomer, 'This 
is the last time I'm going to tell you (that) it's the last time I'm going to 
one of your boat races.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, sometime in January, I get a call from Woomer. 'OK, big mouth,' he 
said. 'Why don't you tell me how to fix this thing?' And the next thing I knew 
I was appointed commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 The sport was withering away through lack of marketing, both inside and 
outside the sport. Each year it seemed harder to find competitive boats and 
racing sites. 
</P>
<P>
 When the season started with the Gold Cup -- the Super Bowl of hydroplane 
racing -- there were only 10 boats in the water, and there are only eight races 
on the schedule, not enough to attract big-money sponsors needed to field more 
boats. The fleet had shrunk to seven boats in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got to come up with a strong schedule, at least 12 races, maybe 15, in 
places like Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York and maybe Phoenix and Las 
Vegas," Doner said. "We have to give sponsors, potential sponsors, something to 
think about. The sport has spent too much time in the boondocks. How can you 
sell a race in Evansville, Ind.; Pasco, Wash., or Madison, Ind.?" 
</P>
<P>
 Those are three of the eight racing sites on the 1994 schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 "To have 12 or 15 races, we would need at least 20 boats to start the season," 
Doner said. "Since Day 1 on this job, I've been on the phone, cajoling 
potential sponsors. There were a bunch of them at the Gold Cup, and I hope what 
they saw is what they like because we need them to come back -- with money." 
</P>
<P>
 A crowd of 350,000, as estimated by the Detroit Police Department, witnessed 
the Gold Cup, which concluded with a hull-to-hull race won by Mark Tate in 
Smokin' Joe's boat over Nate Brown in the Tide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The unlimiteds still draw the biggest sporting crowd in Detroit, and it's the 
same in Seattle," Doner said. "What we need at some of the other races is a 
side show. If it takes hiring Evel Knievel to jump over some boats, I'll get 
him. There has always been too much down time, time when there was nothing for 
the spectators to do but just sit. 
</P>
<P>
 "If (actor) Don Johnson and his wife have a spat, I want them to have it in 
the pits at Seattle, and then they can make up in the pits at San Diego. 
Whatever it takes, I want unlimiteds to be talked about." 
</P>
<P>
 Bernie Little, the Florida beer distributor whose Miss Budweiser boats and 
sponsorship money have been the backbone of hydroplane racing for 30 years, was 
against ousting Jones, but says he will support Doner. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a hustler. He's been running his butt off to get things done," Little 
said. "He's trying to do a positive job, and as long as he keeps going in the 
right direction, I'll give him all the support I can." 
</P>
<P>
 Little, 69, has been an unlimited hydroplane owner for 32 years, and with Chip 
Hanauer as his driver and a new twin-hulled boat, was favored to win his 15th 
series championship before Hanauer was injured in an accident during the Gold 
Cup race. Hanauer's injuries are expected to keep him sidelined until 
midseason. Mike Hanson, who filled in for Hanauer, finished third in the Gold 
Cup and won the race last week on Lake Lewisville. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's still Chip's ride all the way," Hanson said. "The boat is only on loan 
to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Hanson will be in it again next Sunday when the series resumes on the Ohio 
River, near Evansville, Ind. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanauer, who is home in Seattle recuperating, is not expected back until the 
series reaches Pasco, Wash., on July 31. The unlimiteds will be at San Diego's 
Mission Bay on Sept. 18. 
</P>
<P>
 Little, inducted into the National Motorsports Hall of Fame in Detroit last 
week, not only owns the No. 1 boat, but is also responsible for Budweiser's 
sponsoring two races, the Governor's Cup at Madison, Wis., and the Columbia Cup 
at Pasco. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bernie Little has been the best thing and the worst thing -- at the same time 
-- in this sport," Doner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "His support, in sponsoring races as well as his boats, and the publicity he 
has given unlimiteds, has saved the sport. At the same time, his domination 
with the best boat, the best driver and the biggest budget has discouraged 
other teams." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Little hired Hanauer as his driver three years ago, the team has won 15 
of 22 races, including the 1992 and 1993 Gold Cups. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has been like Roger Penske with Indy cars," Doner said. "Penske, who was 
winning everything anyway, built a still better engine this year for Indy and 
the race was no contest. Bernie is the same way. He has a new boat that was 
built around the new fuel restrictor valve, which will give him even more of an 
edge." 
</P>
<P>
 The valve is designed to keep the consumption of fuel in the turbine engines 
at 4.7 gallons per minute, thus keeping the engine cooler and preventing parts 
from burning up. 
</P>
<P>
 An immediate result was to slow the boats. Tate ran a Gold Cup record lap of 
170.087 m.p.h. last year on the Detroit River. This year, the fastest lap on 
the 2.5-mile course was Hanauer's 162.614 in Miss Budweiser. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was more than pleased with the way the restrictor valve did its job in the 
Gold Cup," Doner said. "Not a single boat had engine damage from overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 "There wasn't a person on the river who could tell the difference in speeds 
when Smokin' Joe's and Tide came around the Roostertail Corner about three feet 
apart in that final heat. If the guys I brought in as potential sponsors didn't 
like that for excitement, maybe I'd better go back to putting up grandstands."

EVERY DAY IS FATHER'S DAY; FAMILY IS CLOSE TO DODGERS' BRETT BUTLER, EVEN WHEN 
IT'S ACROSS COUNTRY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's about a $40 cab ride from the heart of Atlanta to the Butlers' home in 
nearby Duluth, a beautiful two-story traditional in a cluster of estate-like 
houses just beyond the Chattahoochee River. Not a mansion by any means, and not 
as nice as the house they are building with retirement in mind, although 
retirement is not really on Brett Butler's mind. At least not until the family 
votes him out. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a baseball bat lying on the edge of the front lawn, giving the house 
some visual separation from the rest on the block. But inside, it appears to be 
ordinary life on a Saturday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a huge family room and television downstairs, but Blake, 6, is in the 
corner of the kitchen lying on a converted bench, watching cartoons on a 
13-inch color television. Over near the food cupboard, Brett, just home from 
taking his four children to the pool, is explaining to Abbi, 12, and her 
friend, Sarah, that yes, they can have some chips, but if they don't eat their 
lunch, he will not be happy. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Florida room, which in California would be called the living room, lies 
the evidence that this family is truly different. In piles everywhere are 
clothes, neatly folded and stacked. In two days, Eveline Butler, her four 
children, two dogs and 11 suitcases will make their pilgrimage back to Los 
Angeles for the summer, so they can be with Brett and live together as a family 
for 10 weeks. Stefanie, 10, and Katie, 9, are their other two children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have tried it every way, putting the kids in school in both places, Atlanta 
in the winter and in the city Brett plays in during the summer," Eveline said. 
"I have hired tutors, even home schooled them. But we decided a couple of years 
ago that the best way was to keep them in Atlanta at home during school, and 
then join Brett when school lets out.  
</P>
<P>
 "When Brett first started playing, we thought it would be a couple years and 
it would be over. I mean, you think about it, he was a 23rd-round draft pick 
and not a home run hitter. I always said to him, I love you, I will follow you 
everywhere, just never to Cleveland. Well, God has a good sense of humor, 
doesn't he?" 
</P>
<P>
 After two seasons with the Braves, Butler was traded to the Cleveland Indians 
before the 1984 season. The trade came as a shock, since Butler's only full 
season with the Braves, 1983, was successful. But there they were, two years 
after they were married, living in Cleveland for four years, then in San 
Francisco for three, and now Duluth and L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told him he would get the first 10 years, and I would get the second 10, 
and I kid him that he's on my time now," Eveline said. "Audrey Chambliss (Chris 
Chambliss' wife) said to me as this little rookie wife, 'If you remember two 
things, you will do OK. First of all, it's a business, and second, don't ever 
take anything personally.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Near the end of last season, the Dodgers had a $3.5-million option to keep 
Butler another year, and they picked it up. With the minor league outfielders 
still unproven, with Darryl Strawberry's status uncertain and the departure of 
Eric Davis, Butler represented stability and productivity. He batted around 
.300 most of the year, more than satisfied his role as the leadoff hitter and 
again, played an errorless center field. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, he is putting up All-Star numbers, even hitting home runs. He is 
batting .322 with 77 hits, 45 runs, three home runs, 44 walks and shares the 
league lead with seven triples. But there is no option remaining on his 
contract, though the Dodgers have several options of their own. Raul Mondesi, 
who played center field until this season, is proven, and there is more 
outfield talent at the club's triple-A team in Albuquerque than in any other 
area.  
</P>
<P>
 "As long as I'm producing and living up to expectations, I want to play as 
long as I can," said Butler, 37. "Not in a platoon situation, though, because 
if I am not an everyday player, that will be it. If we get toward the end of 
the season and they tell me that they want to start playing the young kids 
because they have no desire to keep me, then I will send the word out and see 
if anybody else wants me. But I would like to finish in L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler is staunch about not being a reserve, and his teammates would agree, if 
only because he talks so much that there would be an uprising on the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other day when I wasn't playing I must have really been talking because 
Jeff Treadway said, 'Hey Brett, there's a call for you in the restaurant,' " 
Butler said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The restaurant is three levels up, way down the first base line in right 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 But the decision of whether Butler remains with the Dodgers isn't only the 
club's. Last year, when the team told him they wanted him back for the 1994 
season, Butler held a family meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told the kids if they wanted him to retire, he would or he would keep 
playing, whatever the family wanted," Eveline said. "Then we took a vote. The 
three girls voted for him to keep playing, they said they love to watch him 
play and they knew he loved it, and they like to go to the park. I voted for 
him to keep playing too. Only Blake voted against it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Living in Atlanta and having a father who plays for the Dodgers has its 
drawbacks. One winter, Butler said the school bus pulled up and Abbi and Katie 
were in tears.  
</P>
<P>
 "I said, 'What's wrong?' And Abbi said, 'Daddy, the kids are saying the 
Dodgers (stink) and you are no good.' Then Stefanie came in, and she was mad. I 
said, 'What did you do, Stefanie?' She said 'Daddy, I went up to Johnny, or 
whatever the kid's name was, and shook my fist and said, 'We're rich. And if I 
hear one more word from you I am going to punch you out.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Butler tries to keep life as normal for his children as he can. When he goes 
to school functions, the other students have come to learn that he is there as 
a father, not as a baseball player. You can find him playing squirt hose with 
the neighborhood kids, a method also used to curtail curiosity on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was with the Braves, the kids in the neighborhood used to come to my 
door constantly and ask for autographs, so I decided to fix the situation," 
Butler said. "I went out and started playing with them, and they no longer 
asked for autographs, then they started coming to the door and asking if I 
could play.  
</P>
<P>
 "One night we were playing kick the can, and my neighbors were leaving in 
their car, and the woman said to her husband, 'Honey, that big kid is going to 
hurt somebody.' And he said, 'Honey, that big kid is Brett Butler.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Whenever she can, Eveline takes the children to Brett's games, and, when she 
can't, she watches any baseball game to get information on how the Dodgers are 
doing. They talk on the phone every day, sometimes twice, and she and Brett try 
to not to go more than 10 days without seeing each other. Since the season 
started, she has packed up the kids four times and flown to the city Brett is 
playing in on the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't really like it when people say, 'So, what do you do all day?' like I 
don't do anything," Eveline said. "Halle Berry (Dave Justice's wife) was quoted 
in an article talking about how tough can it be to be a baseball wife, when all 
they do is sit in the stands and look pretty. She has no idea what it's like. 
She's off being an actress. Well, that's not what I do.  
</P>
<P>
 "I am not embarrassed because I am not a professional, this is my job, and 
this is what I do. I know plenty of women who got divorces from players and I 
have no ego about not using my education to be a professional. I admire women 
who can work and raise a family.  
</P>
<P>
 "One day, Blake looked across the table at me and said, 'Mom, are you ever 
going to get a job?' I said, 'Blake, you don't think what I do is a job?' " 
</P>
<P>
 The children say they don't mind living in two places, although Eveline says 
it's getting a little tougher for Abbi, who, at 12, wants to hang out more with 
her friends in Atlanta during the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids don't really know any other way of life than this," Eveline said. 
"It's always been this way for them. And sometimes when we are home for an 
extended period of time, they will come to me and say, 'Isn't it time we go on 
a trip?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When Butler was with the Braves, he used to look at teammate Jerry Royster and 
ask him, "Do you ever think I will make as much money as you?" Royster made 
$400,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "Financially we are well set, and we can live in the same style as we do now, 
even if I quit playing," Butler said. "We often talk about what we are going to 
do when I retire, but we really don't have to do anything. About a month ago, 
Al Campanis approached me and told me to stay in the game. He asked me what I 
wanted to do when I'm not playing, and I told him I want to run a club." 
</P>
<P>
 This season, though, the value Butler places on family has been strengthened, 
if that is possible. Two weeks ago, doctors discovered that Butler's mother, 
Betty, has cancer and treatment is ongoing. Butler missed a game to be with his 
mother during surgery, and joined the team two days later in Atlanta, looking a 
little worn. 
</P>
<P>
 "My relationship with God, and the earthquake in San Francisco in '89 is what 
changed my perspective on the game and its importance," said Butler, who was at 
Candlestick Park during the earthquake during the World Series. "If Candlestick 
Park would have gone down, I would have lost everyone in my family, except for 
my children. My mother and my relatives, Eveline, my friends, they were all 
there. There was so much that was destroyed, it put perspective that baseball 
is just a game, and there is so much more that is important in life. And I 
think what happened with my mother has made that feeling even stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 Butler's 14 seasons in baseball are chronicled in his home. A Leroy Neiman 
original hangs in his study, depicting Butler coming out of the batter's box in 
a Dodger uniform. The game was against the New York Mets, and Neiman just 
happened to be present at one of the few times in Butler's career when he has 
hit a home run.  
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I get back home, I don't want to leave," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 On his desk is a gold glove, given to him by a friend after Butler went 161 
games without an error one season and still didn't win the award. "God's Gold 
Glove," it's named. Butler has never won a Gold Glove.  
</P>
<P>
 Remembering how it was supposed to be, a caricature of Butler, Davis and 
Strawberry hangs on the wall, the outfield that could have taken L.A. by storm, 
but, except for Butler, created one instead. 
</P>
<P>
 His jerseys are hung in another room -- Cleveland, Atlanta, San Francisco. But 
there is one missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to wait to hang L.A." he says.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; INSTEAD OF ULTIMATE TEST, FINALS ARE BORINGLY TESTY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One day (soon), the 1994 NBA finals will mercifully be forgotten, remembered 
only as the bridge between the Michael Jordan era and the new 
anti-game-of-force rules. 
</P>
<P>
 If the New York Knicks and Houston Rockets are models of work ethic, digging 
down deep, etc., aesthetically it has been like watching pigs push a ball 
around the barnyard with their snouts. 
</P>
<P>
 And that isn't even the scary part. 
</P>
<P>
 More than style, the NBA was built on personalities, big, open, colorful, 
generous-spirited ones like Julius Erving, Magic Johnson, Larry Bird and the 
pre-scandal Jordan, men who didn't act as if they hated being stars. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before rookies got $50-million contracts and sneaker endorsements 
before they had been in a pro layup line, before coaches started feeling the 
pressure and circling the wagons. 
</P>
<P>
 This series is emblematic of the modern NBA, with personalities that have been 
muted, if not outright repressed. The Rockets are dull. The Knicks are Stepford 
wives. 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks have a public relations department that, for budget, hustle and 
sheer energy ranks above anything in pro basketball, perhaps any other sport. 
At home, their efforts are richly rewarded. Even in the rough-and-tumble 
tabloid world, it's rare that a month goes by without some story about how the 
guys at Madison Square Garden sent some Knick paraphernalia to a kid in a 
hospital who is now a fan for life. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one thing holds the p.r. department back -- the team. 
</P>
<P>
 A Knick media session at the finals goes this way: 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Ewing, a pleasant man who was taught in college to protect himself at 
all times and now rarely grants off-day audiences, has to attend by league 
rule, talks briefly, then sits by himself for the last 15 minutes of the 
30-minute session. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles Oakley talks at length, possibly because he's coming off a 16-point, 
20-rebound game. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Knicks' Oscar the Grouch is upset as usual. At one time or 
another, Oakley will complain he gets too little playing time, too few shots, 
too little publicity, isn't appreciated and has had to wait too long for his 
$2-million-a-year contract to be renegotiated. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd like to lay it all out but doesn't want to incur the wrath of Pat Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakley issues a vague complaint that the Knicks once "dissed" him: "I don't 
hold grudges but they know what happened between me and them. . . . It wasn't 
right." 
</P>
<P>
 Pressed as to the nature of the dis, Oakley rises and walks off, muttering: 
"I'm outta here." 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony Mason, carrying on with a bunch of teammates, says he isn't talking 
any more  
</P>
<P>
 At least three guys are saying that next game they have to "come with more 
force," parroting Riley's new pet phrase. Riley got it from assistant coach 
Dick Harter, who used it all the time during his reign of terror at Oregon 
before taking his force to Detroit, where he taught the Pistons how to be Bad 
Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to believe these sessions were once fun, not inquisitions. To the 
Knicks, they're a grim chore. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner David Stern no longer brags about the graciousness of his stars 
but hasn't addressed the problem. As long as the guys do the basics -- smiling 
for the NBC cameras -- how bad can things be? 
</P>
<P>
 Check the finals ratings, which have dropped to their lowest level since 1990, 
before Jordan hit the big time. That's how bad. ROLLING THUNDER: THE '94 
SHAKE-UP 
</P>
<P>
 There has never been anything like this off-season. So far, the count is seven 
administrators fired, resigned or on leave, plus seven head coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's an update: 
</P>
<P>
 LAKERS -- Del Harris replaced Magic Johnson, who replaced Randy Pfund. 
</P>
<P>
 CLIPPERS -- They deny it, but there are reports that no sooner had Donald T. 
Sterling finished saying, "We're going to keep Danny Manning," than he started 
in on "Can we get Larry Brown back?" Answer: no. The new hope is George Karl, 
but he's under contract and Seattle doesn't want to give him up. 
</P>
<P>
 SEATTLE -- The SuperSonics are close to a deal with departing General Manager 
Bob Whitsitt, who may alight in Portland. Karl wants out but will probably have 
to settle for another raise. Says new Seattle President Bill (son of owner 
Barry) Ackerley: "I keep asking, why because Bob Whitsitt had a contract 
problem does George Karl have to create a contract problem?" BOSTON -- Dave 
Gavitt built the Big East but was more at home with network executives than NBA 
general managers, sat on his reputation and got kicked upstairs by new owner 
Paul (son of old owner Don) Gaston. Bird, who likes playing golf in Florida, 
turned the job down, so the desperate Gaston bumped up untested but popular 
M.L. Carr, who had been in the community relations department, a silly p.r. 
ploy that fooled no one. Everyone wonders why Red Auerbach is sitting still for 
this, but Red's horses were Gavitt and Bird. 
</P>
<P>
 DETROIT -- Isiah Thomas handed his long-time sponsor, owner Bill Davidson, a 
list of demands to stay: a $50-million chunk of the team plus operational 
control. Thomas then told the newspapers that Davidson agreed, whereupon 
Davidson slapped Thomas on ice. Thomas bolted for Toronto, where he will become 
general manager/minority owner. 
</P>
<P>
 GOLDEN STATE -- New San Antonio General Manager Gregg Popovich, until recently 
Don Nelson's assistant, is the latest to court Nelson, who has one more season 
before he has an out in his contract and the rumors really start flying. 
</P>
<P>
 CHARLOTTE -- Owner George Shinn wants an assistant coach to help (read: shore 
up) Allan Bristow. Jack Ramsay turned him down, so the Hornets are choosing 
among Seattle assistant Tim Grgurich, Boston's Don Casey, ex-Bull Johnny Bach 
and ex-Clipper Bob Weiss. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW JERSEY -- Howard University Coach Butch Beard, an old Willis Reed 
favorite, is the front-runner to succeed Chuck Daly, ahead of Derrick Coleman's 
candidate, Paul Silas. 
</P>
<P>
 PHILADELPHIA -- John Lucas succeeds GM Jim Lynam and Coach Fred Carter. As 
usual, owner Harold Katz makes his "It will be ----'s show" speech. 
</P>
<P>
 PORTLAND -- Super-rich computer dweeb Paul Allen staged his long-awaited 
purge, fired Coach Rick Adelman, pursued Mike Krzyzewski and Nolan Richardson, 
but now is down to interviewing . . . Bob Hill? Hill was the Pacer coach before 
Brown, the guy who showed what you couldn't do with that team. 
</P>
<P>
 SACRAMENTO -- Portland General Manager Geoff Petrie, well-liked and respected, 
landed here. Droll, unlucky but so-far bulletproof Jerry Reynolds remains as 
personnel director. 
</P>
<P>
 WASHINGTON -- Lynam, an old friend of General Manager John Nash, becomes 
coach, replacing owner Abe Pollin's old favorite, Wes Unseld. 
</P>
<P>
 SAN ANTONIO -- Disaster area. New General Manager Popovich is expected to 
coach if he can't get Nelson or Karl, but the problem is, five years later, 
they still haven't found one good young player to go with David Robinson. New 
owner Robert McDermott, an insurance millionaire who was once a one-star 
general in the Air Force and likes to be addressed as "General," sacked GM Bob 
Bass and chased off Lucas, who realized he was in an impossible position 
between uncontrollable Dennis Rodman and a clueless owner. One of McDermott's 
employees recently confided to a San Antonio writer: "The general doesn't like 
being criticized."

DESPITE THEIR NUMEROUS FAULTS, KNICKS ARE CLOSING IN ON TITLE; PRO BASKETBALL: 
NEW YORK CAN WIN FIRST NBA CHAMPIONSHIP SINCE 1973 WITH GAME 6 VICTORY TONIGHT 
OVER ROCKETS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They have an offense that belongs in the World Cup, a starting point guard on 
the sidelines with a blown-out knee, a starting shooting guard who spent time 
in the World Basketball League, a key frontcourt reserve who had stints in 
Turkey and the U.S. Basketball League, a starting small forward whose 
reputation is dominated by that time he got four layups blocked on the same 
possession and a coach who has been spending considerable time defending his 
team's rugged style of play. 
</P>
<P>
 And they are one victory away from the NBA title. 
</P>
<P>
 The New York Knicks will apologize right after they chill the champagne. If 
they put the Houston Rockets on ice tonight in Game 6 of the finals at the 
Summit, or if it takes until Wednesday's Game 7, they will toast this group 
that only a few seasons ago, when Pat Riley arrived, would have been considered 
rag-tag. They will have redefined the process so much, they will celebrate 
trying to go from first to last. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like we've been at this forever," Riley said. "We started the season 
at midnight on October the sixth. We wanted to be the first team to hit the 
floor in '93 and hopefully the last team to leave it in '94. It's been a very 
enduring process and our guys have hung in there tough. Right now we're on the 
brink of doing what we've dreamt about." 
</P>
<P>
 That is, going from a 39-43 record just before Riley arrived to winning the 
championship three seasons later. To make that dream reality, to win their 
first title since Red Holzman's 1973 club, the Knicks need only repeat their 
accomplishment of a week and a half ago, splitting at the Summit. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we want to take that mind-set down there," Riley said. "It's 
been a three-year run for us, it's been eight months (this season) and I think 
our guys are going to be really ready to play as hard as they've ever played in 
their life. It's one of those 'ever' games, to get a forever experience. I 
think we're going to come real hard, and if we play well and do the things we 
are capable of doing, we've got a great shot. We've won down there this year 
already and we feel like we can defend them a little bit, so we just have to 
deal with the emotions, playing on the road, knowing they're going to be a 
desperate team and knowing they are going to be much better than they were at 
the Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 "Is (winning tonight) imperative? I don't know. We have a 3-2 lead and we know 
the worst thing that can happen to us is taking it to the seventh game. But it 
would be a good opportunity for us on Sunday night to finish it out." 
</P>
<P>
 So it's settled. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens Sunday?" guard Derek Harper asked, repeating a reporter's 
question after Friday's victory at Madison Square Garden. "We win the 
championship Sunday." 
</P>
<P>
 Houston, meanwhile, has dug a beachhead that should be familiar to the Knicks. 
Familiar because it's the one they have used most of the playoffs. The 
desperate moments energize them the most, the various there-is-no-tomorrow 
chants. Pick a cliche, any cliche. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put nothing past the Houston Rockets," said their coach, Rudy Tomjanovich. 
"I have a lot of confidence in this team; we have character. I think we're 
better with our backs up against the wall, like most people. We've got a lot of 
fight in us." 
</P>
<P>
 Said center Hakeem Olajuwon: "We gave our fans at home a second chance. We 
accomplished our goal by saving the home-court advantage. They have maximized 
(at the Garden), so now the ball is on our court. We have to step up and take 
the challenge. That is what it's all about. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to look at it one game at a time. Game 6 is a very important game. We 
have been on the road to play three games, so we will be very happy just to be 
at home, in front of our home crowd, and just tie the series first and worry 
about the rest later." NBA Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Pat Riley is looking to join Alex Hannum as the only coach to win titles with 
two organizations. Hannum did it St. Louis in 1958 and Philadelphia in 1967 
while Riley, of course, has four rings from the Lakers in the '80s. Five others 
have reached the finals with two teams. . . . In every game so far, the team 
that has grabbed the most rebounds has won. "It's not a coincidence," Riley 
said. "Both teams are similar -- the post game and running, three-point 
shooting, pick-and-roll games are very similar so it does come down to that 
part of the game. Possessions and making sure you're not giving up a lot of 
second shots." . . . A victory will make New York the first city to have NBA 
and NHL champions the same season. This is the seventh time a city has had both 
teams as finalists.

NICKLAUS CAN'T HIDE HIS DISAPPOINTMENT; U.S. OPEN: THIRD-ROUND 77 TAKES 
FOUR-TIME CHAMPION OUT OF CONTENTION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Jack Nicklaus finally acted his age. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, he's 54, nothing to be ashamed of but decades removed from 
Thursday in the U.S. Open, when he was 22 as soon as Barbara Nicklaus cast a 
spell on her husband as a joke. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus shot 69 that day at Oakmont Country Club; he shot 77 Saturday when 
his years and the course caught up with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed, sure, because I had a chance to win the national 
championship," Nicklaus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus shot himself out of any chance with a horrific round that took him 
from three shots off the lead and left him wilted in the rough, 10 shots behind 
Ernie Els with only 18 holes to go. 
</P>
<P>
 After his first 10 holes Saturday, Nicklaus was five over for the day, which 
meant only one thing for his U.S. Open hopes: "That was it." 
</P>
<P>
 It was surprising to hear he thought he had a chance at winning the Open, 
since he had all but conceded missing the cut in an interview after playing 
poorly in a practice round Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus probably got caught up in the excitement after rounds of 69 and 70. 
</P>
<P>
 That could explain why Nicklaus was testy when he was asked how many more 
chances to win the Open he had left. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how to answer that question," he said. "Why do you ask that? I 
don't know. I might feel great next year and do something great." 
</P>
<P>
 He's already done something great at the U.S. Open, which he has won four 
times. Even if Nicklaus won't admit it, his chances for another are running out 
fast, if they haven't disappeared already. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicklaus is playing his 38th U.S. Open, which is in its 94th year. That means 
Nicklaus has been in 40% of all U.S. Opens. 
</P>
<P>
 He leaned against a fence outside a trailer in which he had signed his name to 
a scorecard that read 77. The fence was beneath a grandstand at the 18th green 
and Nicklaus was twice drowned out by cheers from the stands. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't hear that much for me all day," he said.

NEWSWIRE: HUFFMAN VAULTS TO U.S. RECORD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For Scott Huffman, it was a new record. For Jackie Joyner-Kersee, it was an 
old story. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman set an American pole vault mark of 19 feet 7 inches Saturday in the 
USA-Mobil Outdoor Track and Field Championships at Knoxville, Tenn., breaking 
the record of 19-6 1/2 set by Joe Dial seven years ago to the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffman, the top-ranked pole vaulter in the United States last year, won his 
second consecutive national title with the vault, the best in the world this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two other vaulters -- Sergei Bubka of Ukraine and Rodion Gataullin of 
Russia -- have vaulted higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner-Kersee, a dominant figure in international track, has become the most 
unbeatable national figure in the women's long jump in nearly half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner-Kersee won that event for the fifth consecutive time Saturday. Five 
titles in a row are the most for a women's long jumper in the national 
championships since Stella Walsh won eight in a row from 1939-46. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh won 10 titles overall, Joyner-Kersee has six. 
</P>
<P>
 Joyner-Kersee won her sixth with a wind-aided leap of 23 feet 5 1/4 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 She set the American record of 24-7 last month at the New York Games. 
</P>
<P>
 Connie Price-Smith completed her third consecutive shotput-discus double, 
taking the shotput at 64-3 3/4, a meet record and the second-best ever by an 
American. Price-Smith won the discus at 195-1 Friday night. Tennis  
</P>
<P>
 Meredith McGrath won the battle of unseeded Americans to take England's 
Eastbourne grass-court championship with a 6-2, 6-4 victory over Linda 
Harvey-Wild. 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick Rafter of Australia won his first ATP Tour title with a 7-6 (7-5), 7-6 
(7-4) victory over top-seeded Wayne Ferreira at England's Manchester Open. 
</P>
<P>
 Top-seeded Thomas Muster of Austria, forced to play two matches because of an 
earlier rainout, won both and advanced to the final of an ATP tournament at St. 
Poelten, Austria, where he will face Tomas Carbonell of Spain. Golf  
</P>
<P>
 Dave Stockton shot a three-under 69 in the second round of the $1-million 
BellSouth Senior Classic at Nashville, Tenn., to give him a two-day total of 
131. That allowed Stockton to hold a one-stroke lead over Lee Trevino, who had 
a seven-under 65 in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Second-round leader Betsy King dropped back into a four-way tie after the 
third round of the LPGA Rochester (N.Y.) International. King shot even-par 72, 
allowing Patty Sheehan, Kristi Albers and Michele Redman to catch her at 
10-under 206. Auto Racing  
</P>
<P>
 Toyotas were swapping the lead midway through the Le Mans 24-Hour race in 
France, with a pair of Dauer-Porsches lurking nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Andskar of Sweden, Georges Fouche of South Africa and Lionel Rovert of 
France were handling the lead Toyota followed by the Toyota of Briton Eddie 
Irvine, Italian Mauro Martini and American Jeff Krosnoff. 
</P>
<P>
 Hut Stricklin escaped injury in a crash during the final practice for today's 
Miller Genuine Draft 400 at Brooklyn, Mich. Jurisprudence  
</P>
<P>
 Sentencing in Oregon has been rescheduled to July 13 for Jeff Gillooly, the 
former husband of figure skater Tonya Harding. Gillooly pleaded guilty to 
racketeering in the Jan. 6 attack on figure skater Nancy Kerrigan.  
</P>

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; WYNALDA SCRATCHES HIS FOUR-YEAR ITCH; 
GROUP A: DESPITE A CASE OF HIVES, U.S. FORWARD SCORES TYING GOAL, ATONES FOR 
RED CARD HE RECEIVED IN ITALIA '90 OPENER. 
</P>

<P>
 The last time Eric Wynalda played in the United States' opening game of a 
World Cup, in 1990 against Czechoslovakia, he was sent off the field early with 
a red card and a red face. His coach and most of his teammates were so angry 
they would barely speak to him, and he was wondering if his debut as an 
international player was also his farewell. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't. After serving his one-game suspension, he came on as a substitute 
in the United States' third and final game of Italia '90 and since has had a 
successful professional career in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But that experience against Czechoslovakia remained on his conscience until 
Saturday. In the 58th minute of the United States' opening game of the 1994 
World Cup, he left the field looking no less like Eric the Red. But, this time, 
he was flushed not with embarrassment but with a rash that covered much of his 
body. 
</P>
<P>
 And when he arrived at the bench, his reception was much warmer than it had 
been four years ago in Florence. Most among the Silverdome crowd of 73,425 
cheered, and his coach, Bora Milutinovic, hugged him. 
</P>
<P>
 That was because, in the final minute of the first half, Wynalda had scored 
the goal that ultimately enabled the United States to tie Switzerland, 1-1, a 
goal that his teammate, Paul Caligiuri, later would call "one of the greatest 
in World Cup history." 
</P>
<P>
 Although that might have been an exaggeration, it was one to admire. On a free 
kick from 28 yards, Wynalda sailed the ball over the Swiss wall and into the 
top left corner of the net, a virtually impossible spot for goalkeeper Marco 
Pascolo to defend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had to be perfect," Wynalda said, "and that's what it was." 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda, who seldom practices free kicks because he is almost never called on 
to take them, was not the first choice to take this one. Under normal 
circumstances, midfielder Claudio Reyna would have been. But he did not play 
Saturday because of a hamstring injury. In his absence, two other midfielders, 
John Harkes and Tab Ramos, made motions toward the ball. But Wynalda, a 
forward, beat them to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Eric just stepped up," Caligiuri said. "He didn't want anyone else taking 
that shot." 
</P>
<P>
 After scoring, especially in the World Cup, most players celebrate as if they 
had just hit the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda stood and looked at the ball in the net as if it were an apparition. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I was almost in disbelief," he said. "I remember looking at 
John and Tab, and then I really didn't know what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-six hours earlier, Wynalda, 25, of Westlake Village, was not sure if he 
would play because of an allergic reaction to -- he now believes -- something 
he ate that caused his torso, thighs and hands to break out in a rash. Team 
doctor Bert Mandelbaum diagnosed it as hives, gave him an antihistamine and 
said Wynalda should be fit for the game. 
</P>
<P>
 But the itching was so irritating that Wynalda said he couldn't sleep Friday 
night. He complained so much in the dressing room before the game that 
Caligiuri, a defender from Diamond Bar and one of the team's veterans, said he 
took him aside and told him to keep his misery to himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was almost to the point that it was having a negative effect on the rest 
of the team," Caligiuri said. "We were getting ready for one of the most 
important games of our lives, and he was distracting us. I told him that he 
should overcome the adversity and be a positive influence. He proved he was up 
to the challenge because he was a leader out there." 
</P>
<P>
 He was until 13 minutes into the second half when, worn down by the heat, 
humidity and fatigue, he asked to come out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel today was a good example of the new Eric," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So did the man who coached the U.S. team in the last World Cup, Bob Gansler. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you realize that Eric played about the same number of minutes in this game 
as he did in the one in Italy four years ago?" Gansler said. "But his effect on 
this game was a bit more significant. 
</P>
<P>
 "It wasn't only the goal that impressed me. You can just tell that he's gained 
so much maturity. He's a player now. It's the difference between someone who's 
becoming a star and a wanna-be."

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; ANALYSIS; U.S. MADE ITS POINT, IT WASN'T 
CONVINCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Was it a point won or two points lost? 
</P>
<P>
 In holding Switzerland to a 1-1 tie at the Silverdome on Saturday, the United 
States accomplished something it had not done since 1950 -- it earned its first 
World Cup point. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Swiss were supposed to be the team the Americans could beat, 
especially in the sauna-like atmosphere of the Silverdome, described by 
Switzerland Coach Roy Hodgson, as "like playing in a hot dog stand." 
</P>
<P>
 A victory would have given the U.S. team three points and good chance to 
advance to the next round from a group that includes Romania and Colombia. 
Romania took the lead in the group with a 3-1 victory over Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, both teams walked away with a share of the spoils after a game that 
featured two excellent goals scored on free kicks and a lot of hard work by 
both sides but little else. 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgson said the postgame atmosphere in the Swiss locker room was anything but 
upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like a morgue in there," he said. "People are very disappointed because 
we thought we played quite well. We passed the ball well. We thought we did 
enough to win the game. The atmosphere in the dressing room is more like after 
a defeat than after a point won." 
</P>
<P>
 There was much the same feeling among the American players. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very lackluster performance, really," midfielder John Harkes said. 
"The main thing is, we know we can play better. We've got to lift our spirits. 
Coming away with a point is a lot better than coming away empty-handed." 
</P>
<P>
 Especially considering how much the Swiss dominated play, particularly in the 
second half when it was all the U.S. defense could do to hold them at bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Marcelo Balboa and Alexi Lalas, the two central defenders, threw themselves at 
everything that came their way. Left back Paul Caligiuri seldom made a wrong 
move. On the right, Cle Kooiman appeared a lot less comfortable and time and 
again was forced to hoof the ball aimlessly out of bounds under pressure from 
the ever-dangerous Alain Sutter. 
</P>
<P>
 But the defense held. Had it not been for Thomas Dooley's ill-timed tackle 
that led to the first-half goal by Swiss midfielder Georges Bregy, goalkeeper 
Tony Meola might have had a shutout. He deserved one. Meola played a solid game 
and did well to handle the numerous crosses that came flying in from the wings. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there, Hodgson acknowledged, that the Swiss broke down. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't do enough with our crosses," he said. "We got the ball wide like we 
wanted to do and got the movements going in the wide positions quite well, but 
the quality of the final ball in (to the center) wasn't good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "Also, we didn't take our chances. There were two very good chances which we 
didn't take, and at this level of football if you don't take your chances you 
don't win the games." 
</P>
<P>
 Bregy, 36, certainly took his chance, firing home a free kick that flew past 
the wall and left Meola rooted to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda's strike on a free kick from a similar position was perfectly placed, 
finding the angle of the crossbar and goal post beyond goalkeeper Marco 
Pascolo's reach. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynalda's emphatic goal erased the stigma of 1990, when he was red-carded in 
the opening game. But the Americans did not capitalize on the momentum when 
they came out for the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, it was the Swiss who mounted attack after attack, only to see their 
offense foiled by the U.S. defense, Meola or poor finishing. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Bora Milutinovic's team relied on counterattacks, but those became more 
infrequent as the match wore on. 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes, for one, was unhappy with the way the U.S. midfield -- with the 
exception of himself and Tab Ramos -- consistently refused to move forward on 
offense. The result, he said, was to give Switzerland the upper hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "We invited the pressure on top of us," Harkes said. "We didn't really get at 
them, and when we did it was only with one or two players attacking five at the 
back and it made it very difficult to score." 
</P>
<P>
 Hodgson, meanwhile, was taking a better view of the tie than his players. 
Switzerland last took part in the World Cup in 1966, when it was knocked out in 
the first round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm taking the chance (to enjoy it) while it's here," Hodgson said. "It took 
us 30 years (actually 28) to reach this World Cup, it might take us another 30 
years to get to the next one and I'll be long gone. So I'm going to enjoy it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that we gave a good account of ourselves, a good account of Swiss 
football, and that's very important for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Americans are showing they can play the game. But there still are those 
who wonder what might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a bit frustrated," Harkes said, "because I think Switzerland was there 
for the taking. I would have liked to have gotten three points from the first 
game. But they're probably happy with the point, as we are." 
</P>
<P>
 After 44 years without one, the United States should look on this as a point 
well-taken.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; COMMENTARY; UNCOOPERATIVE ROMANIA SETS 
U.S. UP FOR FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Don't look now -- and if you are like the majority of American television 
viewers, chances are you didn't -- but this World Cup tournament took a mighty 
wicked twist on the home team Saturday afternoon, and for that we can thank 
that renowned Romanian pop icon, Boy Gheorghe Hagi. 
</P>
<P>
 Hagi was supposed to tumble for us, he and his Romanian teammates, leaving 
Colombia precisely where it belonged after one game (atop Group A) and putting 
the United States one point up in the race for the group's other automatic 
boarding pass to the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't that how Alan Rothenberg had characterized U.S. chances of advancing to 
the next round? "A lead-pipe cinch?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, the lead-pipe cinch was looking more and more like a lead balloon after 
Hagi shredded Colombia at the Rose Bowl with one booming goal and two deft 
passes that led to others, enabling Romania to upset one of the tournament 
favorites, 3-1, while putting a serious crimp in any U.S. plans to still be 
around and kicking come July. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Colombia is miffed, and it gets the Americans Wednesday afternoon at the 
Rose Bowl. Colombia not only needs to beat the Yanks in that one, it needs to 
stomp them. By two goals, at least, if it is to balance its goal-differential 
account, so important when it comes to placement in the second round. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, next Sunday, the United States plays Romania at the Rose Bowl. Romania 
already has broken in the place, it knows the angles, and it has Hagi, who did 
the unthinkable Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 He silenced the huge pro-Colombia crowd that had turned Pasadena into North 
Bogota for a day and sent the confident Colombian players into the tunnel 
muttering to themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 To advance, the United States, most likely, needs at least three points in 
group play. It has one after tying Switzerland in its opener, which means it 
now must either: 
</P>
<P>
 a) Tie both Colombia and Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 b) Beat Colombia. 
</P>
<P>
 c) Beat Romania. 
</P>
<P>
 Ahem. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, there's always France '98. 
</P>
<P>
 If you don't think about it, four years can pass just like that. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S.-Switzerland was clearly the undercard on the Group A marquee Saturday. 
Romanian Coach Anghel Iordanescu has proclaimed Colombia and Romania the class 
of the group and at this point, who's to argue? 
</P>
<P>
 Colombia has jaw-dropping speed and sends its attackers at the net in waves. 
First, Faustino Asprilla, then Adolfo Valencia, then Freddy Rincon. The 
onslaught can be numbing, and Romanian goalkeeper Bogdan Stelea did everything 
but don a jetpack in a scrambling defense of his territory. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania simply grabs the midfield by the throat and squeezes until it gives. 
Its defensive style is physical and oppressive and when Iordanescu added an 
extra defender late in the second half -- bringing the total on the back line 
from five to six -- it wasn't uncommon for Asprilla to begin a dribble toward 
the box, look up and find four yellow shirts in his face. 
</P>
<P>
 Romania also had to overcome a considerable home-field disadvantage, braving a 
sea of flapping Colombian flags and screaming yellow fright wigs, worn out of 
deference to the storied Colombian midfielder Carlos Valderrama. 
</P>
<P>
 But Romania's first goal, by Florin Raducioiu via a brilliant bouncing 25-yard 
pass from Hagi, made all that hair stop standing on end. It was 2-0 after 
Hagi's towering shot hooked the top right corner of the net, and in the 89th 
minute, it was that man Hagi again, pounding a long ball so hard that Colombian 
goalkeeper Oscar Cordoba misplayed it into an easy poach for Raducioiu. 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about the odds of his squad advancing to the round of 16, 
Iordanescu mused -- and you can blame the translator -- "You can never not be 
sure. Because the ball is round and football is football." 
</P>
<P>
 And Romania is undefeated, and Colombia is fixing to let off some steam, and 
the poor United States is left in its path, staring wildly into the headlights. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a lousy place to be, and for that, the Americans can blame the hot 
soccer trend of the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. Hagi Chic.

WORLD CUP USA '94 / THE FIRST ROUND; PATRIOT GAMES; ITALY-IRELAND CELEBRANTS 
FORM A PAGEANT STEEPED IN ETHNIC PRIDE 
</P>

<P>
 In the end, it was more than a game. It was a far-off place and, a time -- 
yesteryear to come home to. 
</P>
<P>
 They came in their thousands Saturday to a stadium from which they could see 
the shimmering towers of a great city immigrant ancestors had built. 
</P>
<P>
 They came remembering. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irish came from Dublin, yes, but joyous battalions trekked also from 
Queens, and Ohio, and with their pipes and their shamrock shirts from suburban 
New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 There were some Italians from Rome, but many more from New York, Philadelphia, 
and Ontario, Canada; first-generation immigrants half a century removed from 
rural poverty, and proud second-generation Italians from Albany, N.Y, and 
Scranton, Pa., who can't say " Buon giorno ." 
</P>
<P>
 They came, 74,826 of them with flags, banners and ethnic pride, to cheer a 
game their fathers had loved more. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the cheering, they turned Giants Stadium into a gigantic celebration of 
self. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is who I am, this is my heritage," said Bob Wade, who brought his 
bagpipes and a vanload of fellow Irish-Americans from Pittstown, N.J. "I think 
Ireland can go all the way -- and we'll be here all the way." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasquale Steriti left the hills south of Rome looking for work 20 years ago. 
He found it in Philadelphia. On Saturday he came to the New Jersey haze with an 
Italian flag wrapped around his neck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm American, sure. But I eat Italian, I dream Italian, my heart -- right 
here -- will always be Italian," Steriti said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, traffic roared along the New Jersey Turnpike and streamed toward New 
York on Route 3. New York has the Knicks, the Yankees and Mets, the new 
champion Rangers, probably also the Gay Games higher on its sports agenda than 
soccer. America at large cares even less. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet for all of the rookie fans there Saturday afternoon, Giants Stadium 
quickly acquired an intensity so consuming it might have been in Europe, South 
America or one of the other continents where soccer comes first. 
</P>
<P>
 Like the game, the stadium Saturday belonged to Ireland, the green, white and 
orange outnumbering the Italian colors seven or eight to one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounded like a home match to me," said Ray Houghton, who scored the only 
goal. "We were told there would be more Italian fans than Irish, so we couldn't 
believe what we actually saw. It certainly gave us a great lift." 
</P>
<P>
 And that, opined psychiatrist Joseph Gagliardo on his way to the stadium 
Saturday, is really the name of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Gagliardo immigrated to the United States from Sicily in 1953. He lives in St. 
Louis, but Saturday afternoon found him happily in a forest of Italian red, 
white and green. 
</P>
<P>
 "Are people crazy to come thousands of miles to see a soccer game? No. Sports 
has replaced religion for many people. Soccer, well-played, is even more 
beautiful than religion," said Gagliardo, who hadn't seen Italy play in person 
for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 David Coleman, an Irishman who emigrated to Canada in 1975, came from Toronto 
with two friends to cheer for Eire. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a strange place to find a World Cup. People have no feel for the game. 
You can't build soccer like this from the top down; it has to come from the 
grass roots. It's a bit like having the World Series in England," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonio and Amerigo Bevilacqua, who left a mountain village near the Adriatic 
Sea 40 years ago for a new life in Canada, drove down from Welland in Ontario 
for the game, lugging two well-worn flags that read "Forza Italia." 
</P>
<P>
 "People on this side of the ocean don't know about this game," Antonio said. 
"That's their problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberto Falciani, a Roman who found a pasta dish in Manhattan on Friday night 
he said was as good as any he has ever eaten at home, (fettucine with shrimp 
and green peas) is more sanguine about America's Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to encourage the game here, and this must help," he said. "Of course 
people are different, and it may be that Americans never come to love the game 
as we do." 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of them loved it Saturday -- many for the first time, and perhaps most 
for reasons that had less to do with sports than with family histories. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Colagiovanni, a young lawyer and second-generation Italian-American who 
grew up listening to his father and uncles rave about a game he hardly knew in 
a language he barely understood, came home with a rush Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an American," he said. "But today I'm also Italian."

BASEBALL / ROSS NEWHAN; PATIENTLY AND WITH FORESIGHT, INDIANS STUCK TO PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS NEWHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Switchboard operators at Jacobs Field gave the following greeting this week: 
"Thank you for calling the first-place Cleveland Indians." 
</P>
<P>
 What a message. What a thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Not since July, 1974, have the long-suffering Indians been in first place this 
late in a season. "It's always exciting to play well, especially when you 
consider what we've had to do to get to this point," General Manager John Hart 
said from Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 Sticking with a plan, the Indians now boast one of baseball's most potent and 
talented young teams, proving, as have other small-market teams, that the 
current economic system doesn't have to mean automatic ruin. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the impetus of a new stadium in a city experiencing similar renewal, the 
Indians have sold 2.63 million tickets and are certain to break the club record 
for total attendance of 2.62 million, set in 1948. 
</P>
<P>
 They have won eight consecutive games overall and a club-record 17 in a row at 
Jacobs Field, where they are 22-7. They have a 3 1/2-game lead over the 
Minnesota Twins in the American League Central and a five-game lead over the 
favored Chicago White Sox.  
</P>
<P>
 Only a potential work stoppage seemed likely to intrude on their mood and 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd hate to see the season end early, but I don't worry about things I can't 
control," Hart said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The greater good of the game is more important than what we're doing in 1994, 
and basically the system doesn't work, despite what we've been able to do in a 
small market. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of clubs don't have the ability to do what they'd like to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ability? Hart was being kind. Maybe it's more a matter of foresight and 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians' five-year goal was to be competitive when they moved into their 
new stadium. The blueprint: (1) focus on young players by clearing the roster 
of high-salaried veterans through trade or free agency; (2) employ the savings 
to rebuild the farm system and creatively retain the best of the young players 
with multiyear contracts designed to avoid arbitration; (3) reach a point where 
cautious use of free agency could fill in the gaps. Here's how they executed 
it: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Among the departed: Joe Carter, Brett Butler, Tom Candiotti and Greg 
Swindell. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Among those acquired in trade: Carlos Baerga, Sandy Alomar Jr., Paul 
Sorrento, Kenny Lofton (in a steal for Ed Taubensee) and Mark Clark (at 8-1, 
does anyone remember Mark Whiten?). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Up from the system: Albert Belle, Jim Thome, Mark Lewis, Chuck Nagy, new 
closer Paul Shuey and rookie-of-the-year candidate Manny Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Signed as free agents last winter: Eddie Murray, Dennis Martinez, Jack 
Morris and Tony Pena. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had some blue-chip young players who always believed in their ability and 
were at the point of saying, 'Hey, we're capable of winning now, get us some 
help and we'll prove it,' " Hart said, referring to his signing of Murray, 
Martinez, Morris and Pena "who came in and reinforced the feeling, contributed 
to the fever." 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians lost 105 games in 1991 and 86 in each of the last two seasons. 
They traveled with decades of bad baggage, and were haunted last year by the 
deaths of Steve Olin and Tim Crews in a Florida boating accident. Hart told the 
players they weren't tied to the past; the '90s had nothing to do with the 
'50s, '60s, '70s or '80s. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd been improving steadily, looking for that breakthrough season," he said. 
"That's not to say this is it, the end-all year. We still have holes. You can't 
do everything at once. But we have a chance now to be competitive every year 
for the rest of the '90s, and if you're competitive, you can win, and we have 
the ability to win." 
</P>
<P>
 In '94, it might depend on how Shuey, 23 and two years out of college, holds 
up in relief; how Martinez and Morris, both 38, hold up in the second half; how 
Clark and Nagy continue to pitch and how this strike-threatened season plays 
out. Beyond that, Hart said, a franchise "long perceived as the poorest-run in 
baseball now has to be taken seriously." No matter the system. COMPETITIVE 
BALANCE 
</P>
<P>
 Of all the aspects of the owners' labor approach, nothing annoys the players' 
union more than the ongoing assertions by chief negotiator Richard Ravitch that 
the current economic system -- with the revenue disparity between clubs -- has 
eroded and will continue to erode competitive balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence suggests otherwise: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Since 1981, every National League team except the expansion Florida Marlins 
and Colorado Rockies has won at least one division title. The "have-not" 
Pittsburgh Pirates, to use Ravitch's terminology, won three in a row; and the 
"have-not" Montreal Expos would be leading every other division except the one 
that includes the Atlanta Braves, whom they are challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Since 1981, every American League team except the Indians, Texas Rangers 
and Seattle Mariners has won at least one division title, and the Indians and 
Rangers are leading their divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ten teams have won the World Series since 1981, including the "have-not" 
Twins twice; and 20 of the 28 teams currently have legitimate shots at a 
division title or wild-card playoff berth. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has nothing to do with competitive balance, and Ravitch knows it," Don 
Fehr, the union's executive director, said of the salary-cap proposal. "No one 
takes that seriously. This has everything to do with money and the clubs 
wanting more of it." 
</P>
<P>
 It starts, of course, with the proposed 50-50 split, which significantly 
lowers the players' compensation share from the current 58%. And it includes 
the elimination of arbitration under a cap the players consider restrictive to 
salary growth and destructive to free agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Jeff Moorad, a respected agent: "The owners have put the cart before the 
horse. They can't convince the players to modify the compensation system until 
the players are convinced the owners themselves have done everything they can 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 That would be to implement revenue sharing among the clubs without linking it 
to a salary cap, as they have. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's much too logical," Fehr said of revenue sharing without a cap. "The 
only reason they link it to a cap is so that the (big-market) clubs giving the 
money will get something back. In other words, when the Dodgers give money to 
the Padres, they want the players to pay them back under a cap that's well 
below market level. 
</P>
<P>
 "We proposed modifying the compensation system with a variance of revenue 
sharing among the clubs in 1985, and we were laughed at. I'm sure we'd be 
laughed at if we proposed it again." THE UNCERTAIN RACE 
</P>
<P>
 The threat of a work stoppage has left managers in a quandary. Do they push 
injured players? Do they go to four-man rotations? Do they play it to the hilt 
on the assumption, as they like to say, that there are no tomorrows? 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't figured out yet if it's still early (in the season) or late," 
Manager Jim Fregosi of the Philadelphia Phillies said. 
</P>
<P>
 The safest course, Manager Terry Collins of the Houston Astros said, is to 
assume it's late. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, we don't know what's going to happen, but in a lot of ways, we've 
got to approach the next month like it's the last month of the season," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why I'm not giving guys days off as much as normal. We've got to play 
the next few weeks almost like September. You want to position yourself to be 
in first place if there's a work stoppage, because who knows when we'll pick it 
back up or what will happen with the standings when they do, if they do." THE 
SANDBERG FILE 
</P>
<P>
 The assertion by Angel batting instructor Rod Carew that a struggling Ryne 
Sandberg had bailed out on his struggling Cub teammates is a view also raised 
in Chicago as possibly affecting Sandberg's eventual Hall of Fame candidacy. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlikely. Sandberg spent 13 years in the majors. He was productive offensively 
in eight of those years. He will be measured on the productivity of those 
eight, combined with his defensive dominance. His statistics compare favorably 
to the 13 second baseman in the Hall, and it is generally acknowledged he was 
one of the best at the position. 
</P>
<P>
 He received 10 Gold Gloves and about $18.5 million in Chicago Tribune gold 
over the course of his career. His premature retirement enabled the Cubs to 
save between $15.7 million and $18.7 million, but General Manager Larry Himes 
said he isn't rushing out to spend it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to spend money just to spend it," he said. "If we get back in 
the hunt later in the season, then it might be something to consider, but not 
now. Money isn't always the answer to everything. We have players who need to 
play better. We can win games if they do." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cubs have only two players remaining from 1991 -- Mark Grace and Shawon 
Dunston. Grace might leave as a free agent. Dunston wonders if he shouldn't go 
as well. Voicing some of the same concerns regarding direction and stability 
that Sandberg did in the spring, Dunston said: "The guys who had pride in 
putting on a Cub uniform are almost all gone now. It started when they couldn't 
keep Mad Dog (Greg Maddux). Then they let Hawk (Andre Dawson) go, now Ryno. 
Those three guys are going to the Hall of Fame. We should still have them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mark may be next. Why would he want to stay? That leaves me. What am I doing 
here? Maybe it's time for me to go too. I don't blame Ryno for leaving. I don't 
know where this club is going. Are they rebuilding? Who knows? Do they know?"

<P>
 Mark Loretta experienced his first taste of big-time professional baseball 
when he appeared in several spring training games at shortstop for the 
Milwaukee Brewers. 
</P>
<P>
 A second taste came last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta, a former St. Francis High standout, played for a Texas League 
all-star squad in two games against all-stars from the Mexican League. 
</P>
<P>
 The first game was played in Monterrey, Mexico, before a crowd of 18,000. "You 
couldn't hear yourself think," said Loretta, a seventh-round draft choice last 
year from Northwestern. "(The crowd) didn't shut up the whole time." 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta played the first three innings of the opener and was hitless in two 
at-bats as the Texas Leaguers lost. 
</P>
<P>
 However, in the second game, he played nine innings and was two for four with 
a run scored and two stolen bases as the double-A team earned a split. After 
the game, he was named most valuable player in the series. 
</P>
<P>
 Loretta, who had a 15-game hitting streak that ended just before the all-star 
break, is batting .300. 
</P>
<P>
 His team, the El Paso Diablos, has been as hot as the weather in the 
Southwest. The Diablos lead the league by nine games and clinched the 
first-half championship more than a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been playing well, but it's a grind," Loretta said. "It's really hot 
and we've only had about three days off in a month." 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee has been struck by a series of injuries to its infielders, but 
Loretta, no matter how successful, would be a longshot for a September 
major-league call-up. He is not on the club's 40-man roster. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to progress a level a year," Loretta said. "So far, I've been 
able to do a little better than that." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, a lot better. Loretta last season started off in Helena, Mont., in the 
rookie Pioneer League.  
</P>
<P>
 He played only six games there, batting .321 with a home run and eight runs 
batted in. He quickly was promoted to Stockton of the Class-A California 
League, where he spent the rest of the season, batting .363 with four home 
runs, 31 RBIs and eight stolen bases. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tigertown training: It has been 17 months since Mitch Root played in a minor 
league baseball game, but the former Chatsworth High outfielder and shortstop 
is ready to jump-start his career with the Detroit Tigers. 
</P>
<P>
 Root, 20, was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in 1991 and batted .336 for the 
Cubs' rookie team in Huntington, W.Va., in 1992. Last winter, however, after 
the second of two shoulder surgeries -- a reconstructive operation -- the club 
released him. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers signed Root three weeks ago, and he has been working out at the 
team's Lakeland, Fla., training facility in preparation for an assignment to 
Class-A Jamestown, N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's throwing the ball better right now than he has since his junior year in 
high school," said Root's father, Barry. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Delighted Dodger: J.P. Roberge used to be a Dodger fan. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's a Dodger. 
</P>
<P>
 The former St. Francis High and USC infielder was an 18th-round draft choice 
by the Dodgers earlier this month. He signed and reported to rookie training 
camp in Vero Beach last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It being the Dodgers, I couldn't ask for anything more," said Roberge, whose 
parents have Dodger season tickets. "They've always been my favorite team. I 
think I got drafted by the right team. They'll get the most out of my skills 
and versatility." 
</P>
<P>
 Roberge batted .332 with 11 home runs, 48 RBIs and 18 stolen bases as a junior 
this spring. He is expected to be assigned either to the Dodgers' rookie league 
team in Great Falls, Mont., or their Class-A affiliate in Yakima, Wash. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Short hops: Erik Hiljus, a fourth-round pick in 1991 by the New York Mets from 
Canyon High, recently returned to Class-A St. Lucie after serving a 
club-imposed two-week suspension.  
</P>
<P>
 Team officials would not divulge the reason for the suspension and Hiljus 
could not be reached for comment. The 6-foot-5, 225-pound right-hander has a 
record of 3-5 with a 3.97 ERA. In 70 1/3 innings, he has allowed 68 hits and 34 
walks with 62 strikeouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, Hiljus led the Mets' farm system with 157 strikeouts in 146 
innings for Class-A Capitol City, Fla. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Craig Clayton, a former All-American utility player from Cal State Northridge, 
has been demoted from double-A Jacksonville to Riverside of the Class-A 
California League.  
</P>
<P>
 Clayton is in his first full professional season as a pitcher after impressing 
Seattle Mariner officials during the fall instructional league and again during 
spring training. 
</P>
<P>
 He started the season in Jacksonville, but pitched only 12 1/3 innings and was 
twice placed on the disabled list because of a sore arm before his assignment 
to Riverside early this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In 10 games for Jacksonville, Clayton allowed eight hits, six walks and five 
earned runs while striking out 13. He had one save. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle continues for Derek Wallace from Chatsworth, the Chicago Cubs' 
top pick in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-3 right-hander has been demoted to the bullpen in double-A Orlando, 
Fla., after posting a 2-9 record and a 6.40 earned-run average as a starter.  
</P>
<P>
 Wallace has allowed 80 hits and 23 walks and has hit nine batters in 70 1/3 
innings. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Like Wallace, former Poly High standout Javier Delahoya has been banished to 
the bullpen after a slow start.  
</P>
<P>
 Delahoya, a right-hander, has a record of 0-6 and an ERA of 5.78 for the 
Florida Marlins' double-A affiliate in Portland, Me.  
</P>
<P>
 After 10 starts, he has made five bullpen appearances. He has two saves. 
Delahoya was released last winter by the Dodgers after posting an 8-10 record 
for double-A San Antonio. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Gregg Zaun, who was expected to push for a spot on the Baltimore Orioles' 
roster, is having a tough time at triple-A Rochester, N.Y.  
</P>
<P>
 The former St. Francis High catcher, a nephew of former Oriole and Dodger 
catcher Rick Dempsey, is batting .188 with only 10 RBIs in 170 at-bats.  
</P>
<P>
 Zaun last season batted .306 in double-A and .256 in 21 games after being 
promoted to Rochester.

 * PISTOL PEDRO: Former Dodger Pedro Martinez was involved in yet another brawl 
Tuesday night, this one involving the Pittsburgh Pirates after Blas Minor hit 
Larry Walker of the Montreal Expos with a pitch. Martinez had hit Carlos Garcia 
earlier. Martinez has hit nine batters, and the Expos have been hit 23 times, 
some in obvious retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Martinez has to start acting more like a pitcher and less like a showcase," 
Pirate pitching coach Ray Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Expos look at the counts and situations and don't think Martinez is 
throwing at people intentionally. They have had him throwing to a mannequin 
between starts to get a better feel for pitching inside. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not worried about him hitting batters," Expo pitching coach Joe Kerrigan 
said. "I'm worried about him finishing them off with two strikes." 
</P>
<P>
 * PACE OF ANOTHER KIND: At 42-21 through Thursday, the Atlanta Braves have not 
had a better record after 63 games since moving from Milwaukee. However, they 
are bucking precedent. With Otis Nixon, Ron Gant and Deion Sanders gone, the 
Braves had only 36 stolen bases, projecting to 91 for the season. Only four 
clubs since 1969 have had fewer than 90 stolen bases in a season and won a 
National League pennant. 
</P>
<P>
 The Braves also had grounded into 69 double plays, projecting to an NL-record 
180. 
</P>
<P>
 General Manager John Schuerholz said: "We're not a speed team. We're a 
pitching, defense and situational-hitting team. We're a 
lead-the-league-in-home-runs team." 
</P>
<P>
 * UNRETIRED? The National League leader in All-Star voting at second base is 
the retired Ryne Sandberg, a 10-time All-Star who doesn't rule out playing in 
the July 12 game. "I wouldn't say no right now, but I don't know if I'd say 
yes," he said. "I'm not sure it would be right to take the place of an active 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 * IN A GROOVE: First baseman Hal Morris of the Cincinnati Reds, after sitting 
out the first two months of last season because of a separated shoulder, came 
back to bat .317 and is quietly having a most-productive 1994 season, leading 
the NL with a .359 average. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles the other day, teammate Kevin Mitchell said: "He reminds me of 
Keith Hernandez. No matter where it's pitched, he hits it. When Hal is on, the 
only way to get him out is to pitch him an invisible ball. Then again, he'd 
probably hit that too, and the fielders wouldn't be able to find it."

ACCIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-seven people were taken to area hospitals with minor injuries after an 
escalator at Camden Yards in Baltimore jerked to a stop and sent riders falling 
atop each other before Saturday night's game between the Orioles and Minnesota 
Twins. 
</P>
<P>
 The injured were taken to four area hospitals after the accident, which 
occurred about 20 minutes before the game between the Twins and Orioles, said 
Spiro Alafassos, an Oriole spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of them were transported to the nearby University of Maryland Medical 
Center and the Mercy Medical Center, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mostly orthopedic problems -- abrasions, lacerations, sprained ankles, 
cuts. At this point it looks like no one will probably need to be admitted," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It went click-clack and whoosh. It's just like the floor went out from 
underneath us," said Greg Johnson of Brooklyn, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 Alafassos said the escalator would remain shut down until safety inspectors 
arrived to determine the cause of the accident.

<P>
 Ramon Martinez started Saturday's game against Colorado in place of scheduled 
starting pitcher Tom Candiotti, who was scratched about 4 p.m. because of a 
sore toe on his right foot. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Candiotti) wanted to try it, but there's no sense in doing that, maybe hurt 
something else," pitching coach Ron Perranoski said."I asked Ramon if he'd be 
OK, and he said yeah." 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez started Saturday on his regular four days of rest, and Pedro Astacio 
is scheduled to pitch today, also on four days' rest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll give that thing as much time as we have to," Perranoski said. "I'd 
think (Candiotti will start again) around Tuesday." 
</P>
<P>
 Trainer Bill Buhler said Candiotti aggravated the big toe on his right foot 
during batting practice Friday night, and that Candiotti has suffered from the 
problem before -- only never enough to miss a start. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Left-handed reliever Brian Barnes, acquired from the Cleveland Indians on 
Thursday, was rocked in his first Dodger outing Saturday night. Barnes entered 
with one out and the bases loaded in the sixth and gave up a two-run 
ground-rule double to Mike Kingery and a run-scoring single to Joe Girardi. He 
was replaced by Roger McDowell without recording an out. 
</P>
<P>
 Barnes relieved Ismael Valdes, who had been perfect in his first two outings 
but walked the only two Rockies he faced Saturday. Both scored. TIM KAWAKAMI

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; TEAM SAYS PROSPECT ANDERSON READY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The name is Garret Anderson, and he is responsible for creating quite a 
pleasant dilemma for the Angel management these days. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Angels contend there's no harm keeping Anderson at triple-A 
Vancouver, at some point, they realize they'll have no choice but to bring him 
up to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply, this 21-year-old has little more to prove in the minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Anderson, a left-handed outfielder rated the organization's top prospect, 
began Saturday batting .352 with six homers and 50 runs batted in. He went six 
for eight Friday night against Calgary to extend his hitting streak to 27 
games, while hitting safely in 42 of 44 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's ready for the big leagues and we know that," Angel General Manager Bill 
Bavasi said recently. "It's just a question of when we bring him up." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels probably will delay any decision until they can find a spot for 
Anderson in the daily lineup. They almost had the need Saturday when left 
fielder Jim Edmonds suffered a bruised right shoulder in the first inning while 
diving for Norberto Martin's line drive. Edmonds was forced to leave the game 
in the second inning. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury, however, is not expected to keep Edmonds out long. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 White Sox Manager Gene Lamont yanked Roberto Hernandez from the closer's role 
Saturday after blowing a 3-0 lead in Friday's 5-3 loss to the Angels. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Hernandez's third consecutive blown save. He had saved 38 games in 44 
opportunities last season, but only seven of 11 this season with a 6.58 
earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 "Roberto knows he hasn't done the job," Lamont said. "He feels as bad as 
anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez, a former Angel farmhand, will now pitch in middle relief, Lamont 
said. He will use a bullpen-by-committee until Hernandez regains his form. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Manager Marcel Lachemann, on playing utilityman Mark Dalesandro for the final 
three innings Friday night: "He swings a good bat, and besides, I don't know if 
I could ever get out of this town alive if I didn't play him." 
</P>
<P>
 Dalesandro, born and raised in Chicago, has had more than 100 friends and 
family at the games this weekend. BOB NIGHTENGALE

DOUBLE THEIR PLEASURE; FATHER'S DAY TOURNAMENT ALLOWS TWO GENERATIONS TO SHARE 
LOVE OF TENNIS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Can you imagine a father in his 70s and a son in his 40s playing baseball or 
football on the same team to enjoy a Father's Day weekend? It's probably not 
likely in either of those sports. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's been happening in tennis this weekend at the Newport Beach Tennis 
Club. The event is a father-son senior open doubles tournament, sanctioned by 
the Southern California Tennis Assn. The father must be a least 60 during 1994 
for the team to qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's part of what makes tennis the game that it is," said Dick Miller, 40, 
who entered the tournament with his father Bob Miller, who is 72. In fact, Bob 
Miller is the one who suggested the event a year ago to Irv Goldberg, general 
manager at the club. 
</P>
<P>
 The Millers, who both live in Laguna Beach, have turned father-son tennis into 
an experience that could go under a microscope for a lesson in successful 
parenting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel my father gave me a great gift when I was growing up with tennis, and 
now this is a gift I can give back, by being able to do this with him," Miller 
said. "Tennis is one of a few sports that a parent and a child can do together 
until they die. My dad is in his 70s, but we're still playing tournaments 
together. And, for me, that's a real emotional high." 
</P>
<P>
 They played in their first father-son event 31 years ago in a tournament at La 
Jolla that has doubles competition in various family combinations. They've 
played in at least one father-son tournament each year since. This will mark 
their 31st consecutive year at La Jolla. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been a unique sort of experience, one that we've both really enjoyed," 
Bob Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been able to put aside all the generational differences and build a 
real close association," said Georjean Miller, Bob's wife and Dick's 
stepmother. 
</P>
<P>
 And at a time when some top young players are coming unwound emotionally and 
are burning out in a blaze of parental pressures, Dick Miller looks back and 
thinks that he had the perfect tennis father when he was growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I attribute my love for the game all these years to the way he approached it 
back then," Dick Miller said. "He always treated me the same whether I won or 
lost. And at some point in every tournament you do lose unless you win the 
championship. He would ask me two questions after I finished a match. He would 
say: 'Did you play hard?' If I'd say yes, then he'd ask: 'Did you conduct 
yourself like a gentleman?' If I said yes to that, he would say, 'OK, let's go 
get a piece of pie.' That conversation, or one like it, must have been repeated 
hundreds of times when I was playing in junior tournaments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember one tournament. We were against a top player from a local 
university and his father. His father chewed on him for two straight sets. The 
son was 20 at the time, and I remember after the match was over, the son was on 
the sidelines crying . . . Everyone gets upset when they lose, but you have to 
forget it and look ahead. My father taught me that from the beginning." 
</P>
<P>
 That's part of the reason he enjoys playing doubles with his father now. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was a kid, he made me feel like a star every time I played the game," 
Dick Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 Tennis has been a big part of both their lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Miller played in high school at Glendale Hoover and collegiately at 
Occidental. He continued to play for recreation during his career as a teacher, 
the last 22 years at Corona del Mar High School, and does so now in retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Miller was the No. 1 singles player for four years at Corona del Mar, 
then played in college for nationally prominent teams at Pepperdine. He gave 
the satellite pro tour in Europe a brief try, but he found it lonely and "hated 
it." He came to the realization, too, that he never was going to be one of the 
top 50 players in the world, where he felt he had to rank to make a pro career 
worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 He went back to Malibu and taught tennis in the Malibu Colony, giving lessons 
to, among others, actor Robert Wagner and actress Lynda Carter and the families 
of singers Neil Diamond and Julie Andrews. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was teaching 60 hours a week during the summer months, and I found there 
was a limit to how much time you could spend standing on your feet, even if you 
were doing something you enjoyed doing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At that point, he went into the commercial real estate business with a 
national company. Then, seven years ago, he opened his own business, based in 
Laguna Hills. Today, his company provides leasing and management services for 
more than 2 million square feet of commercial property. 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Miller occasionally plays in some open tournaments in the region, but 
devotes most of his time to his family and his business. He and his wife, 
Gretchen, have two young daughters. She also has a strong tennis background as 
a two-time All-American at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Together they've started a low-key tennis development program in the Emerald 
Bay community where they live. 
</P>
<P>
 "We donate our time to the program," he said. "It's something we really wanted 
to do. We've got 17 kids in the program between the ages of 3 and 6, and the 
thing we're trying to do more than anything else is to get them to have fun 
with tennis. We go out there with hula hoops and jump ropes as well as tennis 
rackets." 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Miller says he feels so good about his own tennis development that he's 
trying much the same kind of it's-supposed-to-be-fun approach with his 
daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to be a great salesman with my kids, and I know how to sell the 
sport," he said. " But I do some silly, stupid things I could never do in the 
business world. My daughter and I play dress-up tennis, where she picks out a 
costume to wear. And I go out there in an Aladdin hat if that's what it takes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some people are turning teaching tennis to youngsters into a big business. At 
least as far as I'm concerned, I just want to turn it back into a game." Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Advancing to the finals of the father-son senior open doubles tournament were 
Spencer Letts and his son, John Letts, and Eldon Rowe and son Brad Rowe. To 
reach today's final at 12:30 p.m., the Letts defeated H.M. Wammack and his son 
J.P. Wammack, 5-7, 6-0, 7-5, in the semifinals. The Rowes beat Gene Land and 
son Jeff Land, 7-5, 7-6 (7-4) in the other semifinal match.

SMITH FORGOES FOOTBALL, SIGNS WITH DETROIT TIGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Keith Smith, the leading passer in California high school history, signed a 
six-figure deal with the Detroit Tigers on Saturday, giving up a scholarship to 
play quarterback at Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith signed for a $200,000 bonus, plus a $50,000 college scholarship, he 
said. Smith, who graduated Friday from Newbury Park High, was the Tigers' 
fifth-round pick in the amateur draft earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think this is what I needed to do to fulfill my dream of being a pro 
athlete," Smith said. "It's what I always wanted to do. I just think it would 
have been taking a risk playing football at that level because they are so big 
compared to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who is 6-feet, 180 pounds, will fly on Monday morning to Bristol, Va., 
site of the Tigers' affiliate in the rookie-level Appalachian League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm looking forward to it," Smith said. "It's going to be tough going away 
from home for the first time, but it will be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 Although most scouts considered Smith a top prospect as an outfielder because 
of his speed and arm strength, Smith will play shortstop at Bristol. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has a big league shortstop's arm," Tiger scout Dennis Lieberthal said. 
"He's very quick. He could be a base-stealing threat once he learns how to 
steal in the big leagues. This guy could go out in the minors and steal 40-60 
bases a year." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith played center field until this season, when he moved to shortstop to 
fill the void left by David Lamb, who was a second-round pick of the Baltimore 
Orioles last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's not really smooth because he's never really played (shortstop)," 
Lieberthal said of Smith. "By the time he goes through his first season, we'll 
know and he'll know if he can play that position. And he can always play center 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith batted .352 with three home runs and 19 stolen bases this season to help 
the Panthers win the Marmonte League championship. As a pitcher, he was 6-4 
with a 2.80 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, he is better known for throwing a football. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith passed for a state-record 9,971 yards in his career. He is second 
nationally to Josh Booty of Shreveport, La., who, interestingly, was a 
first-round selection of the Florida Marlins as a shortstop in the baseball 
draft this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In his senior year, Smith passed for a state-record 4,244 yards and 40 
touchdowns, leading the Panthers to a 14-0 record and the Southern Section 
Division III championship. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the top quarterback recruited by Arizona, according to sources within 
the program, and he signed with the Wildcats in February, turning down offers 
from Colorado, San Diego State and UCLA. Smith planned to play baseball at 
Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 But Smith's stock as a baseball player rose steadily during the season. Just 
before the draft, Baseball America magazine tabbed him the 30th best prospect 
in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of questions about the amount of money it would take to sign Smith, he 
slipped all the way to the fifth round, when the Tigers took him with the 137th 
pick. 
</P>
<P>
 The Tigers bonus offer, however, is the size usually given to players selected 
in the second round. Three of the area's four second-round picks last year 
signed for cash bonuses equal to or less than Smith's. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, it was an offer to good to pass up. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was the toughest thing I've ever done," he said. "If you could have been 
in this house and seen what I've been going through, it's unreal. I'm glad it's 
over."

BLUE JAYS' GREEN FINALLY MAKES THE CONNECTION; BASEBALL: EX-TUSTIN STAR PHONED 
HOME WITH BAD NEWS IN THE SPRING, BUT HE SINCE HAS BEEN CALLED UP TO THE MAJOR 
LEAGUES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Shawn Green pecked hastily at the hotel room telephone buttons in mid-March 
while trying to maintain his composure. Green had news to share -- and it 
wasn't good. 
</P>
<P>
 The former Tustin High outfielder was heading back to the minor leagues, 
having failed to impress the Toronto Blue Jays' brass enough during spring 
training. His bags were packed and his name printed on a one-way airline ticket 
to Syracuse, N.Y., home of the Blue Jays' triple-A affiliate. 
</P>
<P>
 Green expressed his disappointment to his father, Ira, during a phone 
conversation. And while they had shared more upbeat moments, both believed the 
demotion was only temporary. 
</P>
<P>
 They figured correctly. 
</P>
<P>
 Green was yanked from batting practice in Syracuse on June 9 and told to rush 
to the airport. Although Green already was running late, he knew what he had to 
do first: phone home. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says to me, 'Dad, I've got good news and bad news," Ira said. "The bad 
news is that my hitting streak was snapped (at 15 games). The good news is that 
I'm going to Toronto -- tomorrow. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very even-keeled, but I could tell in his voice how excited he was. We 
both were." 
</P>
<P>
 Green's rapid ascent through Toronto's minor league system was punctuated by 
his most recent promotion. Now the hard part begins for the former No. 1 draft 
pick: staying put. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always believed they would call me up whenever they thought I was ready," 
Green said, "but I didn't think it would happen for a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Ira thought otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really didn't come as a surprise to me," he said. "Actually, I think he 
kind of forced them to bring him up." 
</P>
<P>
 At the very least, Green's torrid play at Syracuse gave Toronto management a 
friendly nudge. 
</P>
<P>
 Green, 21, seemingly turned ballparks in the International League into his 
private batting-practice fields, causing fits for opposing pitchers and 
managers at every stop on the circuit. The competition was as pleased to see 
Green move up as he was -- maybe even more. 
</P>
<P>
 A left-handed hitter, Green batted .381 (86 for 226) with eight home runs and 
37 runs batted in during 55 games at Syracuse. His smooth batting stroke 
prompts comparisons with Blue Jay All-Star first baseman John Olerud. He is 
also fleet, as his 46 runs, 16 doubles and 12 stolen bases attest. 
</P>
<P>
 Since arriving in Toronto, Green has played in five of six games. Although 
Manager Cito Gaston has not specified his role, Green said he expects to 
platoon in left field with Mike Huff. 
</P>
<P>
 Green has been the Blue Jays' starting left fielder in four games and is 
batting .133 (two for 15). He singled for the first time Monday night in a game 
against Cleveland, and followed that milestone the next evening with double No. 
1, also coming against the Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto brought up Green briefly last season when the rosters were expanded in 
September. Green, however, knew that move was designed just to provide him with 
a taste of the big leagues. This time, Green is determined to enjoy the full 
helping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being here and playing has been great," Green said. "I was a little nervous 
at first, but I'm starting to get comfortable at the plate again." 
</P>
<P>
 His superiors have noticed, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Jay bullpen coach Dennis Holmberg, Green's manager in Class A at Dunedin, 
Fla., said Green's strides are evident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Shawn is a very talented ballplayer who has moved very fast at a young age," 
Holmberg said. "You watch him and he reminds you of Olerud with that real nice 
swing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He can hit, throw and run. He's only been up for a few days, so he hasn't hit 
for a lot of power yet, but we think he's going to start to come into some 
power." 
</P>
<P>
 This promise prompted the Blue Jays to choose Green with their first selection 
(No. 16 overall) in the 1991 free-agent amateur draft after his standout career 
at Tustin. Green set the Southern Section record for hits in a career with 147. 
He batted .479 as a senior and was selected The Times Orange County player of 
the year. 
</P>
<P>
 His talent did not go unnoticed in the college ranks, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Green was set to begin classes at Stanford when the Blue Jays granted 
themselves an 11th-hour reprieve of sorts by offering a reported $700,000 
signing bonus as part of a package worth $1.45 million -- then almost unheard 
of. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Toronto's offer was the third-largest signing bonus in baseball 
history. With the thought of all that green , Green decided to don blue. 
</P>
<P>
 Had Green set foot in Psych 101 or any other class at Stanford or another 
four-year college, he would not have been able to sign until after his junior 
year, in which he would have again been eligible for the draft. 
</P>
<P>
 "That (bonus) was big back then," Ira said. "But now it's not something that's 
that unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 From the outset, the Blue Jays knew it was money well spent. 
</P>
<P>
 So impressed were the Blue Jays with Green that they started him halfway up 
their minor league system at Dunedin, not rookie ball or on one of their other 
two lower Class-A teams. 
</P>
<P>
 He made management look good by hitting .273 with one homer, 49 RBIs and 22 
stolen bases during his first season in pro ball. Last season, Green hit .283 
with four homers and 34 RBIs at Toronto's double-A affiliate in Knoxville, 
Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout his time in the minors, Green has attended classes at Stanford 
during the off-season. An honors student at Tustin who had a 4.6 grade-point 
average, Green has already completed 102 units. A Stanford official said 
130-180 units are needed to earn an undergraduate degree. 
</P>
<P>
 Green plans to finish his Stanford course work, but at the moment he's 
occupied with his lessons at SkyDome. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got a great opportunity here," Green said, "and I have to take advantage 
of my chance." Shawn Green as a Professional

AT HOME: URBAN LIVING IN A SLICE OF L.A. HISTORY; ANGELINO HEIGHTS: KNOWN FOR 
ITS ARCHITECTURE AND HISTORIC ZONE STATUS, COMMUNITY IS A SECURE PLACE WHERE 
NEIGHBORS KNOW EACH OTHER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

free-lance writer.

<P>
 In 1976, Cecil Dover and Edward Postnikoff responded to a newspaper 
advertisement that promised "a free Victorian home" in the Los Angeles 
neighborhood of Angelino Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two men had no desire to leave their Nichols Canyon home in 
Hollywood, the notice rekindled memories in Dover of the Victorian homes on 
Bunker Hill that he once sketched in his student days at Chouinard Art 
Institute in Downtown Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the "free Victorian home" turned out to be part of a plan to 
rescue two condemned structures from demolition, Dover said their fascination 
with the offer continued to grow. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Carroll Avenue people had created a foundation to preserve the 
neighborhood by buying a large empty lot -- it otherwise would have become an 
apartment building -- then devised a plan to move two Victorian houses, which 
were about half a mile away on the west side of Bunker Hill," Dover said. "We 
just got intrigued by the idea of saving a little bit of L.A. history." 
</P>
<P>
 Dover paid $35,000 for the land and $10,000 in moving expenses for the "free 
Victorian house." 
</P>
<P>
 Five minutes from downtown and bounded by Sunset Boulevard on the north, the 
Hollywood Freeway on the south, Bolyston Street on the east and Echo Park Lake 
on the west, Angelino Heights has been called Los Angeles' first suburb. A 
second distinction was achieved in 1983 when the community became the first Los 
Angeles neighborhood to receive the designation of Historic Preservation 
Overlay Zone (HPOZ). 
</P>
<P>
 Dover, who designs commercial projects, and Postnikoff, a hair stylist, put 
$200,000 into fully restoring the 1887 2,200-square-foot house that Dover 
called "a shambles." A large living room was added to compensate for the 
smaller scale of the other rooms often typical of Victorian homes. They also 
added a basement. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Dover once believed that he could never love a place more than his 
former home, with its natural hills and native Sycamores, he has changed his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our hill is just magnificent," he said. "I look out my back bedroom window 
(to) a straight vista across Elysian Park toward the San Gabriel Mountains. 
We're right at the intersection of the Harbor, Pasadena, Hollywood and San 
Bernardino Freeways -- we're so accessible to all the urban delights. Also, I 
think we've enjoyed more friendship with neighbors than any place I've ever 
lived." 
</P>
<P>
 There are some 1,500 households in Angelino Heights' crescent perimeter. 
Roughly 80% of the residents live in single-family dwellings; the rest occupy 
apartments and duplexes. Longtime stays are common among both owners and 
renters. 
</P>
<P>
 While primarily Asian, white and Latino, the hill's multicultural spectrum 
reflects the larger city's ethnic diversity. The mix also brings together a 
blend of economic stratums; here, it is not surprising that a family of 
Cambodian refugees and a noted developer become neighbors. 
</P>
<P>
 Although people are not always familiar with Angelino Heights, the name of 
Carroll Avenue often rings a bell. The residences in the 1300 and 1400 blocks 
represent the highest concentration and best collection of Queen Anne-East Lake 
Victorians in the city. In fact, the 1300 block is listed in the National 
Register of Historic Places. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the 51 Victorians scattered throughout the hill, an array of other 
architectural influences are evident. These include Mission-Revival, 
Craftsman-California Bungalow, Brownstone and Streamline Moderne. 
Significantly, the residents' regard for preserving the past has turned the 
community into a safe haven for Victorians threatened with the wrecking ball. 
In recent years, seven such homes have been moved to Angelino Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 The wide range of homes in Angelino Heights frequently "drives 
brokers/appraisers up the wall," said Jim Dunham, an agent for Fred Sands 
Realtors, who specializes in historical and architectural properties. "You've 
got a whole mix in terms of sizes, ages, architectural styles of houses. When 
you have a property in escrow, it's not always easy (to give) lenders two or 
three comparables. There are so many variations on it." 
</P>
<P>
 At the low end of the price range, a 1920s two-bedroom, one-bath fixer-upper 
on a small lot and a side street sells for $110,000, Dunham said. A 1905, 
2,406-square-foot Craftsman on a 8,505-square-foot lot that recently sold for 
$289,000 represents a high-end example. The average price home is $200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 After going on a West Adams' home tour in 1990, Tracy Stone, Glenda Rovello 
and Joseph DeSousa decided that by pooling their resources they could afford a 
home. What mattered most to the three architects who had met in graduate school 
were size and character. Their requirements were met in a 3,200-square-foot 
1906 house with both Victorian and Craftsman features and with a substantial 
back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was perfect," Stone said. "It had more or less equal bedrooms, which was a 
big thing. We had room for an office. Enough space for all of us to fit into." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Rovello: "The fact that the house only had two previous owners meant 
that it hadn't been significantly altered. The woodwork hadn't been painted. We 
wouldn't have to go through the stripping and refinishing process. It was so 
lovely to walk in and see all its glory." They paid $285,000 in a probate sale. 
</P>

 All three friends make the most of the area's resources. Stone enjoys walking 
her dog in Elysian Park every day and DeSousa relishes the proximity to Dodger 
Stadium. "All of our friends meet us here at the house," he said. "We have a 
beer on the front porch, then walk over to the ballpark together. I think you 
can walk back here faster than you can drive out of the parking lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Further east along West Kensington Road, Bob and Patti Good live in a 1905 
duplex. Bob Good says he had the recession in mind when the couple bought the 
2,600-square-foot former boardinghouse in 1981 and converted it into a duplex. 
Using his GI bill to get a guaranteed loan and with no down payment, they paid 
$119,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had been a renter for years," said Bob Good, who works for a Downtown title 
insurance company. "I could see the value of the house going up and I saw the 
rent creeping up to meet the mortgage. So we moved in and it did. To the point 
that we were living essentially rent-free." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the Goods had their work cut out for them. Besides knocking down 
walls, stripping off paint and tearing up rugs, they had to contend with the 
asphalt shingling that covered the building's exterior. "I had to take off (the 
shingles) one by one. Putty up all the nail holes. Sand everything down. Give 
it three coats of paint. That was about three years of painting," said Bob 
Good. 
</P>
<P>
 Introduced to Angelino Heights by her father who worked in the fire station 
down the street in the 1920s, Patti Good grew up with a fascination for the big 
houses. She likes the strong feeling of neighborhood and bristles at the 
suggestion of suburban friends that their urban home might not be in a safe 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 "According to the local police station, this area is pristine safe," said Bob 
Good. "They say up here nothing much happens." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Yakooji agrees. The costumer for the studios says she feels very 
secure in the neighborhood where she waited several years for a spacious 
two-bedroom duplex to become available. Yakooji, who pays $680 rent for the 
upper-level unit, loves its charm. "It was so sunny. It has 17 windows -- not 
that I count them," she laughs. "I really feel like I'm in a house." 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of the real estate boom of the 1880s, prosperous Downtown 
businessmen and upscale Angelenos cast an appreciative eye on the Angelino 
Heights tract. The elevated terrain that had been subdivided by William W. 
Stillson and Everett E. Hall in 1886 offered beautiful views and a quiet pace 
just a mile and a half from the city's center. In addition, a cable car running 
east-west along Temple Street could bring passengers Downtown in no time.  
</P>
<P>
 But the banking failures in the East two years later brought construction to a 
halt and more than 10 years would elapse before any movement started up again. 
By then the Craftsman/California Bungalow era had begun to take over. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Angelino Heights would never regain the prominence it had known, a 
new luster was acquired between 1915-1920 in the heyday of early movie making. 
Mack Sennett Studios on Glendale Boulevard filmed the Keystone Kops chase 
scenes on these residential streets and stars such as Gloria Swanson and Mary 
Pickford found comfortable addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 The relatively intact neighborhood began to change in the years following 
World War II. The housing squeeze caused the construction of apartments and 
many large homes were converted into multifamily dwellings. Often homes were 
"modernized" with stucco or asbestos shingles. 
</P>
<P>
 By the early 1970s, though, this trend began to reverse itself. Eventually, 
the growing interest in older homes earned the neighborhood its historic 
preservation zone status. 
</P>
<P>
 These days Angelino Heights is undergoing a new wave of restoration activity. 
"Everybody is struggling to evolve their dream house out of this fabric that is 
there," said Cecil Dover. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one is too busy to fail to keep an eye out on their neighbors. "People 
are always watching (out for each other)," said Patti Good. "When I first moved 
here I thought it was nosy people. And now I (feel) it's great. You can't do 
anything without everybody knowing about it. But it's good. It's sort of like a 
real old-fashioned town." At a Glance

 Southland home sales in May remained at their highest level in three years, 
Dataquick Information Systems reported. 
</P>
<P>
 A total of 19,109 new and used houses and condos were sold in Los Angeles, 
Orange, San Diego, Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties in May. That 
was up 4% from 18,378 in April and up 27.4% from 15,001 in May last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The median price paid for a home last month was $168,000, down 1.2% from 
$170,000 in April and down 2.9% from $173,000 in May a year ago. Last year's 
steep price declines appear to be leveling off, Dataquick analyst John Karavoll 
said. Overall prices reached a five-year low in January and February at a 
median $165,000. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego and Orange County both experienced year-over-year price increases in 
the overall category. This was the first year-over-year increase for Orange 
County in 20 months. It was the sixth monthly increase in a row for San Diego 
County, which appears to be well ahead of the rest of Southern California in 
its real estate recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's encouraging that the recent increases in interest rates haven't had more 
of an effect on sales volume," said Dataquick chief executive officer Donald L. 
Cohn. "Instead of deciding not to purchase a home, buyers are choosing to 
finance with adjustable-rate mortgages instead of fixed. Lending institutions 
are also doing all they can to make purchase loans now that the refinance boom 
is over." Southland Home Resales 07,16,08,08,07,08,08,07 County Sold Sold Pct.

 Southern California home builders and architects have won 16 of 37 Grand 
Awards in the Gold Nugget design competition at the 1994 Pacific Coast Builders 
Conference (PCBC) & Remodelers Show, the annual meeting of developers and 
allied professionals from the 14 Western states and Pacific Rim countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Southland builders, designers and projects again dominated the Gold Nugget 
contest, although not by as wide a margin as in the past. Last year, by 
contrast, 22 grand awards went to Southern Californians or their works. 
</P>
<P>
 The design contest was the highlight of the 36th annual PCBC, one of the 
largest building industry conventions in the United States, which ended 
Saturday at the Moscone Convention Center here. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gold Nugget Award competition honors achievements in architecture and 
land-use planning for residential, commercial and industrial projects. This 
year's contest attracted 450 entries. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges were chairman Peter M. Mayer, president of Peter M. Mayer Productions 
of Alta Loma, Calif.; Philip M. Hove AIA, principal of CYP International,

HANDYMAN Q & A: MAKING DECK STAIRS STABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Popular Mechanics 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 QUESTION: The stairs leading from my deck to the ground have become shaky. 
What causes this, and what can you suggest to make them more secure? 
</P>
<P>
 ANSWER: A common cause for loosening deck stairs is frost heaving or settling, 
in that the earth or pad that supports the bottom of the stairs can move. This 
loosens the attachment of the stair to the deck. The first course of action is 
to readjust the bottom support of the stair. If your steps sit directly on the 
earth, shim the stringers with flat rocks or shovel new earth in place. If your 
steps rest on a masonry pad, you'll have to lift and shim the pad. Then, 
reinforce the attachments at the top of the stairs by driving toenails through 
the stringer into the rim joist. 
</P>
<P>
 Through use, the nails that hold the stringers to the stair treads can become 
loose. Use a long clamp to draw the stringers tight to the tread and drive new 
nails to hold the assembly together. Mineral Deposits Set Before You See Them 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the best way to remove mineral deposits from toilets and other 
fixtures and can these deposits be prevented from forming? 
</P>
<P>
 A: You can avoid a buildup of mineral deposits by keeping your fixtures clean. 
Use a general purpose bathroom cleanser with a stiff brush once a week whether 
your fixtures appear to need it or not. The buildup begins before you can 
actually see it. By the time you notice the stain, the deposits will have 
developed a stubborn hold. Inadequate Ventilation Causes Attic Mildew 
</P>
<P>
 Q: I am trying to figure out why I have mildew on the inside of my unheated 
walk-in attic. On one end of the attic there is a crank-out louver window and 
there are two roof vents on one side of the roof. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Mildew on the attic side of the roof sheathing is caused by a moisture 
buildup on the surface, which in turn is the result of inadequate attic 
ventilation. Mildew, which shows up as dark spots on the roof sheathing, will 
not cause the roof deck to deteriorate. Once the attic is adequately vented, 
mildew stops growing. 
</P>
<P>
 The louver window should not be closed during the winter months or ever. Even 
if the total unobstructed attic ventilation opening satisfies the recommended 
formula of one square foot of opening for every 300 square feet of floor area, 
the distribution of the vents may not provide adequate air circulation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ideally, air entering the attic should "wash" the underside of the roof deck 
before venting to the outside. This can usually be obtained by using continuous 
soffit vents and a ridge vent. In your case, you will improve the overall attic 
ventilation if you install a gable louver at the other end of the attic.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For dedicated gardeners, here are suggestions from the California Assn. of 
Nurserymen on what to do in the garden this week:  
</P>
<P>
 * Water tomatoes, melons and cucumbers deeply every five to seven days for 
large crops. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dust grapes with sulfur for powdery mildew and bunch rot. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fertilize fuchsias and tuberous begonias with fish emulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 * Plant vinca for beautiful flowering color through the heat of summer and 
fall. Available in white, pink, purple, lavender and with contrasting eye.

GREEN THUMB; THE DAY THE GARDEN SHOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE GOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Gold lives and gardens in Granada 
Hills. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After remodeling my Granada Hills home, and doing most of it myself, I was 
left with a spacious bare-earth back yard, no gardening experience and a tiny 
budget. Hiring a professional landscaper was out of the question; it was up to 
me. But after all, if I learned to put ceramic tile on my bathroom floors and 
hang wallpaper, I could do certainly do this. 
</P>
<P>
 So I got started. I discovered as I worked that I absolutely adored gardening. 
Even weeding was relaxing on a Sunday afternoon. As I enjoyed my lovely garden 
transformed from a barren wasteland, I was pleased that I had done it myself by 
taking the advice of good nursery people, by extensive reading of garden books 
and by my own hard work. 
</P>
<P>
 After about 18 months, the garden looked so beautiful that I thought of 
sending an article about my experience to The Times. I had originally planned 
to do the article as a step-by-step guide for other novice gardeners. I was 
convinced that if I could do it, others could learn from my experience. 
</P>
<P>
 But it turned out that I had to completely revise my article even before I 
started. 
</P>
<P>
 A terrifying event on Jan. 17 changed all that, when the walls came tumbling 
down not only in my house but on my beautiful garden. 
</P>
<P>
 A five-foot-tall block wall crashed smack on my thriving herb garden and other 
plants. And there it lay for three days. I had no idea what condition the 
plants were in, nor could I do anything about them anyway. I had to immediately 
deal with the damage in my home where I had no gas, electricity or running 
water. 
</P>
<P>
 I found temporary shelter on the other side of the valley at my aunt's house 
where there was running water -- albeit contaminated. I regularly filled a 
dozen large jugs with water and transported them in my car through a maze of 
detours to my home, where the water mains were still broken. There I watered 
the plants through the pieces of the fallen wall as well as I could. And all 
this on top of a 72-mile round-trip commute to work each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after the quake, my neighbors organized a "block party." Starting 
at one end of the street, they formed a relay, removed all of the broken block 
walls and transported them to a dump. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second day of the block party, my neighbors got to my house. Using 
sledge hammers, they pounded the fallen wall into transportable pieces. My 
precious plants underneath were subjected to even more trauma. When the wall 
was gone, I could finally see the condition of my plants and administer CPR. 
</P>
<P>
 First I cut all the torn or smashed plants way back. I needed to fertilize the 
plants to prevent shock and stimulate growth, but I still had no running water. 
Out of desperation, I stood in line and purchased bottled water at my local 
market. A few days later I was able to fill my jugs from large water trucks 
brought to the local high schools for earthquake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 During the ensuing weeks I moved to an apartment while my home was being 
repaired. Each day I stopped by after work to check up on my house and garden. 
</P>
<P>
 About six weeks later, I noticed that something was going on in my garden. All 
my herbs looked fantastic, and new shoots were coming up everywhere. The hedges 
lining my herb garden were getting huge. All my delicate sages came back 
bushier than ever, and the scented geraniums bloomed for the first time. What a 
beautiful sight for me amid all the chaos of destruction and rebuilding. 
</P>
<P>
 This set me to thinking. I read that the Jan. 17 quake was a thrust type, 
sometimes equaling two times the force of gravity. I wondered, was it possible 
that the intense shaking aerated the soil? Or was it the contaminated water I 
schlepped across the valley? Did the little micro-organisms in the water 
provide extra-rich nourishment for my plants? 
</P>
<P>
 I have no definitive explanation for this phenomenon. I may never know, but 
I'm enjoying the results. And if some beauty arose from that horrible 
destruction, this now-devoted gardener will always be grateful for that.

MACARTHUR AWARDS: IN PRAISE OF AMERICA'S GENIUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Richard Rodriguez, Richard Rodriguez, an editor at Pacific News Service, is 
the author of Days of Obligation (Viking). 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Every year now, after the Academy Awards, after the Pulitzer Prizes, around 
the time of the Tony Awards, come the MacArthur fellowships. The "MacArthur" is 
one of Ameri ca's glittering prizes, given to the best among us, the brightest, 
the people who might change America, the people who should be our true heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, MacArthur prizes were awarded to 20 Americans. As in years past, 
and since the award's inception in 1981, the list of winners is a zany mix of 
tenured academics, artists and social activists. Winners are given grants that 
vary from $150,000 to $375,000, spread over five years. (One of the quirks of 
the awards: The older you are, and the more established, the more money you 
get.) 
</P>
<P>
 The media has dubbed the MacArthur prizes "genius awards," a label foundation 
officials reportedly find embarrassing. But the language of the MacArthur 
Foundation grandly describes the awards as going to "exceptionally talented and 
promising individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 It reminds me of that TV show from the '50s -- "The Millionaire." Each week, 
an anonymous rich man would dispense a cashiers check for $1 million to an 
unsuspecting citizen. In the 30 minutes that followed, Americans who had bought 
their tract house with an FHA loan and new Chevy for no money down, Americans 
would watch what happens when sudden good fortune drives up to the front door. 
It was like watching the Publisher's Clearing House Sweepstakes winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Academics are gossips. People who nominate candidates for the prizes are not 
secret, as the foundation would wish. One hears, in detail, about committee 
meetings. The allure of the MacArthur, nonetheless, is its fiction of secrecy 
and its whimsy -- a mimicry of divine providence. 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, one looks for a logic. Why does that elderly Southern writer get a 
MacArthur? Why that political scientist? A juggler wins, or a clown. Why? One 
might as well try reading the mind of God. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the award have noted its leftward tilt and East Coast bias. If one 
were to believe the MacArthur Foundation, the majority of American geniuses 
live east of the Mississippi, are white, male. Latino geniuses tend to be 
social organizers; black geniuses to be writers. There is a startling absence 
of Asians. But to make such observations is to buy into the logic of the 
MacArthur Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman who works as an agent for several sculptors and painters tells me that 
prizes like the MacArthur make artists crazy. "Imagine what it is like to have 
talent, real talent, and yet to go unrecognized; while around you, people as 
gifted or less gifted are winning awards, giving each other awards." 
</P>
<P>
 In the TV show, one never saw the face of the millionaire. One heard his voice 
-- a stately baritone -- Hollywood's version of the voice of God. 
</P>
<P>
 Prizes are given to people who apparently can use the money (social activists) 
as well as to the famous and tenured. The prizes are most distasteful for 
having about them the quality of an experiment. Zeus at play. What would happen 
if we gave that person five years without money worries? 
</P>
<P>
 In the 14 years the prizes have been given, no one has turned down the money. 
Which is a bit of a surprise, if only because one would suppose genius wouldn't 
trust the distraction of money, would fear the temptation of money. 
</P>
<P>
 My suspicion is that true genius is fiendish. The real struggle for the person 
of great talent is not financial but one of direction. (How shall I finish this 
novel?) Once direction is found, then the genius will pursue it, and damn all 
obstacles! Money is the least of it. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, I know choreographers, actors, activists, poets (always so 
many poets) who give up their vocation for lack of next month's rent. The 
burden of the small bill, the shrill voice of the collection agent demanding 
the check for $200, is what deadens the soul. A manuscript gets put into the 
drawer for lack of money enough to pay PG&E. 
</P>
<P>
 John D. MacArthur was different from the Ivy League types who run his 
foundation today. MacArthur was an eighth-grade dropout. A billionaire by the 
time of his death, he made his bucks in real estate and insurance. We like to 
describe such people as "self-made." We imagine the type: gruff, plain-spoken, 
direct. 
</P>
<P>
 It was only after his death, and because of his son, that the MacArthur 
Foundation became mainline liberal in its goals. Yet, there remains about the 
MacArthur prizes a faith that is deeply Protestant, individualistic and 
capitalistic. Give the artist big money and you will get big art. 
</P>
<P>
 Genius, in the opinion of the MacArthur Foundation, is the achievement of the 
individual. Old John D. MacArthur would perhaps be horrified by some of the 
labor organizers and activists who have gotten his money. But the curious thing 
is that the foundation specified that grants will go only to individuals, not 
organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The assumption is that the talented organizer creates organizations, not the 
other way around. So while an educator can win a MacArthur, it is not possible 
for a grant to be given, say, to a Catholic grammar school in 
Bedford-Stuyvesant that routinely saves 6-year-olds. 
</P>
<P>
 The logic of the MacArthur prizes borrows from the "trickle-down" theories of 
the Reagan years. Give the genius an opportunity to spread his or her creative 
wings, and the entire society below will feel the benefit of the achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is also the logic of the "best and brightest" -- that faith that 
flourished during the Kennedy years and that survives in the Clinton White 
House. Get a group of Yale Law School graduates or Rhodes scholars together and 
they can solve any problem. 
</P>
<P>
 It comes down to this: Do you believe that genius -- like the mythic self-made 
businessman -- is a singular achievement or do you believe that genius gets 
created and sustained by an entire society? 
</P>
<P>
 My guess is that America is the creation of individuals, but individuals 
constantly shaping one another, creating one another. A genius happens because 
his mother worked for the phone company to send him to school, or a 
grade-school teacher took dirt wages to teach him to write. 
</P>
<P>
 The crisis in America, the big shots back East keep telling us, is a crisis in 
leadership. We need great people to lead us out of the forest. 
</P>
<P>
 In Asia today, on the other hand, the stress is on elementary-school 
education. In America, because we believe so much in the individual, the stress 
is on higher education. We concentrate affirmative-action programs at the 
university level. We think America needs more brown and black leaders. We talk 
of the importance of role models. We assume the few will change the lives of 
those at the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus do we get the MacArthur prize winners. The talented and the gifted are 
honored with money that will beget more foundation money. All the while, every 
day in America, talent dies. Genius dies early. It dies, often, in first grade. 
It happens quietly, as boredom and despair deaden a young child's eyes.*

THE LOSS OF A HERO IN AN AGE WITHOUT ANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Neal Gabler, Neal Gabler is the author of An Empire of Their Own: How the 
Jews Invented Hollywood (Anchor/Doubleday). He is working on a book about 
Walter Winchell. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Say it isn't so, O.J. That is the refrain one kept hearing after former 
football star O.J. Simpson was charged in the horrifying murder of his ex-wife 
and a friend of hers. I can't think of anyone this popular, this famous, 
accused of as heinous a crime. So we keen for his fall from grace. We hurt not 
only for what he allegedly did to his victims but for what he has done to us. 
</P>
<P>
 On the football field, first as a Heisman Trophy winner at USC and then as a 
record-setting halfback for the Buffalo Bills, Simpson exemplified speed, 
grace, determination, excellence. In the locker room and, after retirement, as 
a sports commentator and commercial spokesman, he personified graciousness, 
modesty and good humor. Above all, perhaps, it was his geniality that made him 
so appealing even to those who don't know a football from a baseball. "Juice" 
was the package: a great athlete and a decent, self-effacing man. 
</P>
<P>
 For years now, it seems we have been lamenting the scarcity of heroes, which 
is why when one falls from the pedestal, as O.J. has, we feel the cultural 
tragedy as well as the human one. Heroes are the repositories of our values. We 
need them to show us our better selves. So why do so few individuals seem to 
qualify these days for canonization, and why do those heroes we do have always 
seem poised on the precipice of their own demise? 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from a crime like Simpson's, the magnitude of which is overwhelming, the 
answers reside less in our flawed heroes than in our flawed selves. 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, heroes are endangered by the diminishing consensus over what values 
we share or at least over who embodies them. Once it was easy. Men who 
demonstrated courage in battle, men like Alvin C. York and Audie Murphy, were 
heroes in anyone's book. Men of genius, like Albert Einstein, could be heroes. 
Men, like Charles A. Lindbergh, who performed acts of physical daring were 
heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before Vietnam, when war came to be perceived by many as less a 
test of one's mettle than of one's savagery, and before the religious right 
began attacking scientific theory, and before technology seemed to reduce 
physical daring. Today, few figures can straddle the right wing and the left, 
the religious culture and the liberal culture, much less the plethora of 
subcultures that now constitutes America. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the few who can, however, are athletes like Simpson. What makes them 
heroes is clean and untainted by political doctrine or cultural bias. On the 
playing field, the only things that count are what one does and how one does 
it. Simpson was an aesthetic hero as most great athletes are: a thing of 
beauty, gliding through the defensive line then high-kicking to the end zone. 
But to the extent that he kept hammering the line in carry after carry, that he 
drew on deeper reserves to continue long after his body had been punished, that 
he played with dignity and honor and that he seemed to have perspective and 
charm, he was a moral hero, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Because they exist in the hermetic sanctity of the playing field, short of a 
major transgression of the sort Simpson allegedly committed, athletes 
theoretically should remain a redoubt of heroism in our increasingly heroless 
society. But only theoretically -- because even athletes cannot escape a virus 
of our own creation that endangers our heroes far more than our confusion over 
values or our lack of a consensus does. They cannot escape the constant threat 
of public revelation. 
</P>
<P>
 We know too much. In the great days of heroism, when America seemed populated 
by giants, the partition between public figures and the public was inviolable. 
What did we know of any of these men and women other than their feats of 
heroism? Once, when I was rhapsodizing about the baseball heroes of my youth 
and mourning the dearth of heroes now, a friend snapped me back to reality by 
suggesting what the tabloids might have done to Mickey Mantle, for one example, 
if journalistic standards had been different in his playing days. The 
drunkenness, the womanizing -- Mantle might well have ended up like Darryl 
Strawberry. 
</P>
<P>
 But the fact is we didn't know. The fact is that there was no pressing need in 
the media or in the culture to want to know. Whatever we might have suspected 
about our heroes -- and we knew they weren't all saints -- the need for heroes 
was a far greater need than the need to know. Perhaps it was an elaborate 
fantasy -- but it seemed a necessary one, and even the press, which did know, 
respected it. 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere along the line, our priorities changed. After decades of protecting 
our heroes, we now challenge them, trying to fine chinks in their armor. 
</P>
<P>
 Heroism is another casualty of our own perverse sense of truth in an age of 
cynical manipulation where nothing is trustworthy. For decades, advertising, 
mass media, political deception and a thousand other small duplicities have all 
contributed to a rampant sense of skepticism -- one now so deeply embedded in 
our culture that we have lost our capacity to be shocked. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect ourselves from the cultural swindles, we use our skepticism as a 
tool. We deploy it like a claw to pry open the old partition and let us see the 
"truth" beyond. We are all deconstructionists now, peeling away images. No more 
secrets. No more fabrications. It is the age of honesty, and hero-worshippers 
are naive fools. Just wait. Even beloved O.J. appears to be a brutal murderer. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the media happily rallied to the call for honesty. What was, for 
the public, an opportunity to regain some measure of control over an illusory 
public life was for the media a wonderful opportunity to hawk papers, magazines 
and TV shows. Heroism never sold as well as dysfunction because, frankly, it 
isn't as entertaining. So the media gave us a small taste of sensationalism and 
then, like pushers, were only too glad to satisfy our addiction. Not only was 
nothing sacrosanct; those who seemed sacrosanct were especially fine candidates 
for desacrilization if they misbehaved. 
</P>
<P>
 Truth-telling, if that be what it is, certainly has its benefits. There are 
things the public has a right and a need to know. But few public figures can 
survive the ruthless revelation-mongering that anyone in the public eye must 
now undergo. No man is a hero to his valet, as the saying goes. But in a 
society where everyone has the privileged vantage point of the valet, the 
question is whether anyone can still be a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of us certainly realized that the new honesty would destroy the old 
heroism, and suffer pangs of remorse over what we know will happen to our 
repositories of virtue once we subject them to the cold eye of the media. For 
people we especially like, as we liked Simpson, we are even willing to ignore 
what the eye reveals -- ignore Simpson's spousal abuse or Magic Johnson's 
promiscuity. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is repression, and we know it. The balance has tipped now. The need 
to know is greater than the need for heroes. The need for a constant supply of 
titillation and scandal -- and let's face it, many are to glued to reports of 
the Simpson tragedy because it fills the role of a soap opera -- is greater 
than the need to protect the few heroes we do have. And as they fall, the 
heroes only confirm what we have long believed and what the media have 
encouraged us to believe because it makes good copy: Deep down, everyone is 
terribly compromised. Even Simpson. 
</P>
<P>
 Say it isn't so, we cry. But it is. And unless we learn to rejigger our 
concept of heroism in an age of revelation, we might be left with no heroes at 
all. Unfortunately, that may be what we deserve.*

THE DEFINING CRISIS; UNLESS U.S.-NORTH KOREA TALKS START SOON, WAR REMAINS AN 
OPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Robert A. Manning, Robert A. Manning, a senior fellow at the Progressive 
Policy Institute, is a former State Department policy adviser on Asia. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just beyond the horizon looms what could be the final phase in the 
ever-deepening crisis over North Korea's nuclear-weapons program -- an end game 
of horrendous conflict resulting in massive destruction and loss of life that 
will make or break the Clinton presidency, define the future of the 
non-proliferation system and shape the geopolitics of East Asia. Former 
President Jimmy Carter's mediation efforts have temporarily halted the downward 
spiral of action-reaction that was narrowing the choices to either retreat and 
acceptance of a nuclear North Korea or a deadly confrontation. North Korea's 
offer to Carter to freeze its nuclear program and to permit the International 
Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to continue monitoring its reactors reopens the 
still slim hope for a diplomatic solution. 
</P>
<P>
 It is hard to overstate the gravity of the Korea problem. This is not Bosnia 
or Somalia or Haiti, human tragedies producing existential angst in the White 
House seminars that pass for policy deliberations. We are not talking about 
peacekeepers or immigration dilemmas. This is the real thing: Korea involves 
vital national interests and has major regional and global consequences. In 
what should not be dismissed as mere rhetoric, Pyongyang warns that the U.N. 
sanctions the Administration is seeking to impose mean war. Yet, the 
Administration has barely begun to prepare the American public for the 
potential consequences of its policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The showdown with North Korea entered a dangerous new stage last month, when 
Pyongyang removed fuel rods from its 5-megawatt graphite reactor, thus 
deliberately destroying key evidence of its past nuclear activities. This 
willful rejection of its Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty obligations led the 
watchdog IAEA to refer the matter to the U.N. Security Council and to cut off 
its technical assistance to North Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 That triggered Pyongyang's announced withdrawal from the IAEA. North Korea has 
still not thrown out two IAEA inspectors monitoring the fuel rods or destroyed 
the cameras and monitoring equipment at its Yongbyon nuclear complex. As 
revealed during conversations with Carter, Pyongyang is using those remaining 
shreds of accountability to bargain for a new round of talks with the United 
States. If North Korea decides to separate the plutonium from the fuel rods, it 
could have enough for five or six bombs within the next two months. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, the only way to assess its past nuclear behavior -- whether 
Pyongyang does have enough plutonium for one or two bombs, as U.S. officials 
suspect -- would be to submit to intrusive special inspections as part of the 
diplomatic bargain. If North Korea goes the final step and removes the IAEA 
inspectors and monitoring equipment, the worst-case will be seven or eight 
bombs -- with no basis for guesstimates. When you add in Pyongyang's crash 
effort to build new ballistic missiles that can hit Japan and its penchant to 
export such missiles and nuclear material to other rogue states, such as Iran 
or Libya, the gravity of the threat posed to international security becomes 
palpable. 
</P>
<P>
 But would the application of U.N. sanctions change North Korean behavior? Not 
likely. As a general rule, carrots work better than sticks. The 
Administration's two-phase approach, with an initial, mild, slap-on-the-wrists 
sanctions resolution to take effect after a grace period if Pyongyang does not 
cooperate, would probably gain Security Council approval if a new diplomatic 
effort fails. But that would only buy more time for a final effort to resolve 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom-line question is whether Pyongyang will trade its nuclear program 
for any package of political and economic blandishments, or whether the 
isolated regime regards its nuclear program as an ultimate insurance policy? By 
removing fuel rods from its reactor, it may be trying to have both the 
ambiguous status of a threshold nuclear power and economic and political 
rewards. Pyongyang may seek a deal based on accepting the possibility that it 
may have one or two bombs in exchange for relinquishing further nuclear-weapons 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem with the Clinton Administration's policy is that, after 16 months 
of diplomatic cat-and-mouse, we still don't know if any deal is possible. 
Washington has yet to present North Korea with a clear and precise incentive 
package, spelling out what is required to resolve the issue and how the United 
States, South Korea and Japan would respond at each step if North Korea 
forsakes its nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 Any credible package must require Pyongyang to cooperate fully with the IAEA, 
dismantle its reprocessing facility and implement the denuclearization 
agreement it signed with South Korea in December, 1991. Washington should lift 
its trade embargo, provide food aid and, along with Japan, offer diplomatic 
recognition. In addition, the United States, South Korea and Japan should 
jointly devise a plan to decommission North Korean nuclear reactors in exchange 
for the financing and construction of more proliferation-resistant light-water 
reactors and other energy alternatives in a reciprocal step-by-step process. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carter trip offers an important lesson to the White House: For diplomacy 
to work, the highest-ranking Administration officials must deal directly with 
top leadership in Pyongyang. Returning to the bureaucratic routine of 
assistant-secretary-level talks will mean a return to petty haggling and game 
playing. Clinton should follow up on the Carter visit by sending a high-powered 
presidential envoy, a prominent figure with stature and bipartisan credibility, 
such as Gen. Colin L. Powell, to Pyongyang with full authority to outline a 
road map for a peaceful resolution.  
</P>
<P>
 This move should be accompanied by several other steps. The President must go 
on television and explain to the American public -- and to Kim Il Sung -- the 
gravity of the situation, the stakes involved and the real danger of war or 
terrorism. At the same time, he must make it clear to North Korea that if it 
does invade the South, the U.S. and South Korean war aims would be nothing less 
than reunification by force. 
</P>
<P>
 If these two steps do not produce a serious, credible response from North 
Korea within a defined time frame, the United States and its coalition partners 
should begin to put in place full-scale sanctions -- banning all financial 
transactions, freezing overseas assets and an oil embargo. North Korea will 
certainly respond -- perhaps, initially sponsoring terrorist acts against U.S. 
and Japanese targets. But the point would be to demonstrate we are serious 
about nuclear proliferation and acknowledge that if North Korea refuses a 
reasonable deal, it mortgages its future and has chosen the path of 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, to be prudent, the United States should enhance its deterrent forces 
-- move more defensive systems in place and increase air power and readiness in 
the region, as the Administration is already considering. If Clinton takes such 
steps, he will have done all that is possible to address a complex situation 
for which there may be no good answer. But anything less would be an abdication 
of U.S. leadership and result in a greater threat to international security. At 
the same time, a credible political solution of the Korea issue would go a long 
way toward redeeming a foreign policy that has begun to corrode the Clinton 
presidency.*

THE NATION; WHEN A CLIENT THINKS HE'S BEING SOLD OUT: THE DELICATE NEGOTIATIONS 
OF PLEA BARGAINS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Suzanne Garment, Suzanne Garment, a contributing editor to Opinion, is a 
resident scholar at the American Enterprise Institute. She is the author of

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Rostenkowski (D-Ill.) is up and around again, talking about the holes 
in the prosecution's case against him. Even though he has now been indicted, he 
looks consid erably more chipper than he did during the weeks when his 
then-lawyer Robert S. Bennett was deep in plea-bargain negotiations, trying 
unsuccessfully to prevent the U.S. attorney from going forward with the 
indictment. This is no surprise. Short of terminal disease, there are few life 
experiences more intensely awful for all parties concerned than the 
plea-bargain process. 
</P>
<P>
 Though not a lawyer, I have seen a few of these exercises up close. One of the 
most harrowing took place during the Iran-Contra affair, when my husband, 
Leonard Garment, represented former National Security Adviser Robert C. 
McFarlane. The prosecutor, Independent Counsel Lawrence E. Walsh, wanted 
McFarlane to plead guilty to felonies. Behind Walsh like a cheering section 
stood his staff, exhorting him to hold that line. On the other side was 
Garment, saying misdemeanors or nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 At some amorphous place in the middle of the mess stood the client, McFarlane 
himself -- thinking he had done nothing criminal (which I, in my biased way, 
agreed with) but knowing if he went to trial, the prosecution would pile on 
enough felony counts to send him to the slammer for years in the event he lost. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, around the edges of the conflict stood McFarlane's friends, some of 
them fierce political fighters who urged him not to plead guilty to anything. 
</P>
<P>
 While the bargaining went back and forth -- offers, counter-offers, waiting 
time -- the real questions hovered just under the surface: Should a man in 
McFarlane's position abandon principle, as the warrior-friends saw it, to 
escape a trial? Could he live with himself if he did? Was it so principled to 
put himself in debt for life trying to fight the government? Was he willing to 
sacrifice his family, which would suffer the pain of any imprisonment he had to 
endure? 
</P>
<P>
 Below these questions lurked still others: Who should he trust? Who was really 
trying to sell him out? 
</P>
<P>
 As luck would have it, our family was going through house renovations at the 
time, so we were living in the McFarlane's basement. When serious floor-pacing 
went on, we could feel it. When lawyer and client got angry with each other, we 
could hear the upstairs as well as the downstairs muttering. When someone 
phoned McFarlane to urge him not to give an inch, we heard the phone ring and 
could sometimes guess that tomorrow was going to be a hard day. If the 
McFarlanes had been less decent people, they would have kicked us out. If 
McFarlane's lawyer had been less stubborn, we would have left. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out all right, sort of. The final outcome was a plea to 
misdemeanors. Author Jeffrey R. Toobin later wrote that some of the Walsh staff 
were upset, thinking their boss had been taken for a ride. I was just as 
unhappy from the other direction, knowing the label "criminal" had been applied 
where it was not deserved. 
</P>
<P>
 A lawyer in this process has to persuade a client to place a huge amount of 
trust in him or her, and it is a hard job under the best circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski's circumstances were not the best. To get the highest-quality 
legal representation, he had hired an extremely well-known attorney. But even 
when such a lawyer does not seek out the press, his high profile makes plea 
negotiations bigger news than they would be otherwise. This is what happened 
here. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Rostenkowski's pals could not keep their hands off this case. They 
were lawyers themselves, or people with lots of experience on the Hill, or 
both. Ideology was not their main motivation. Perhaps some could not bear the 
idea of criminal disgrace for someone they thought a good man and a good 
legislator. Maybe others knew that if Rostenkowski went down the tubes, a large 
part of their own power would go with it. They competed with Bennett for the 
congressman's ear, and "Trust your lawyer" is probably not what they whispered 
into it. 
</P>
<P>
 They had good material to work with, though, because Bennett had taken on 
President Bill Clinton as a client while defending Rostenkowski. There was no 
technical conflict. Rostenkowski probably agreed to the Clinton arrangement. 
But the dual representation dramatized the link between the two politicians and 
might have been expected to give the prosecutors an additional incentive to 
make an example of the congressman: After all, who wants to be accused of going 
easy on a man so visibly tied to the President? Such a thought no doubt crossed 
Rostenkowski's mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, with the deal having fallen through, the House Ways and Means chairman 
does not have to cope with the suspicions and ambiguities of plea bargaining. 
Now he is in a fight and has hired a new lawyer -- he is going to trial. The 
new attorney has come out swinging. He has said that some of the alleged 
offenses are ancient and that the congressman's alleged "ghost" employees did 
government work. He has cited grave separation-of-powers issues in the case. 
Rostenkowski himself has said the government property he allegedly misused was 
not put to personal use. 
</P>
<P>
 It may turn out that the government's case is far weaker than it seemed at the 
time of the U.S. attorney's dramatic indictment press conference. Such a thing 
has happened before in federal corruption cases. On the other hand, it may turn 
out that the jury, cross-pressured by prosecution and defense, will decide to 
split the difference and convict the congressman of just one offense: That 
could send him to prison for longer than the six months proposed in the failed 
plea bargain. So Rostenkowski is on a dangerous path. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet to many people that danger turns out to be more tolerable than plea 
negotiations. In the world of plea bargaining, there is no moral compass. The 
prosecution offers to charge an individual with crimes different from those 
prosecutors believe he or she committed. Or they have charged him with crimes 
they do not believe occurred, so they will have some room for retreat when 
plea-bargain time comes around. Or they allege numerous offenses past their 
statutes of limitations, to increase the aura of guilt and thus ratchet up the 
pressure. An individual guilty of all crimes charged will get off the hook if 
prosecutors think there is a chance of a messy, risky trial. But an innocent 
individual can be coerced into admitting guilt, not by moral suasion but by the 
sheer threat of the state's force. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a dirty process. If a client trusts a lawyer, he or she can come through 
it in one piece. People may open a bottle of champagne at the end of one of 
these ordeals to mark the end of the agony. But it is no real celebration, and 
you can see why some cannot bear going through it.*

THE WORLD; THE ZAPATISTAS HAVE GONE TOO FAR IN REJECTING PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Carlos Monsivais, Carlos Monsivais is a cultural historian and journalist. 
He is also the author of Faces of the Mexican Cinema. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since Jan. 1, the Zapatista National Liberation Army has enjoyed more vocal, 
social and cultural popularity than any subversive group (as they defined 
themselves) known in Latin America. Indeed, public support for the Zapatistas 
has transformed the masked rebels into romantic heroes, with their leader, the 
Subcommander Marcos, becoming a legendary figure -- for some, even 
mythological. Which is why their rejection of the government's peace plan last 
week was so disappointing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatistas have overthrown Cabinet ministers, reintroduced the idea of 
Indian rights and propelled the country into taking a crash course on the state 
of Chiapas, its geography, Indian cosmology, and so on. They have brought to 
light the deep racist sentiments existing in Mexico; accelerated the 
unification and mobilization of non-governmental forces; forced the government 
to backtrack and change its martial disposition, and driven two presidential 
candidates, Luis Donaldo Colosio and Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, to recognize the 
profound motives behind the indigenous uprising. Even the rightist candidate, 
Diego Fernandez de Cevallos, has paid lip service to Indian rights. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the thousands of articles and pronouncements of support, however, have 
backed the Zapatistas' armed struggle or favored the need to continue it. 
Although many justified the use of violence as the last alternative to restore 
law and justice in places like Chiapas, there was not a single movement of 
armed solidarity elsewhere in Mexico. Furthermore, it was reasonable to 
conclude that the Zapatistas either had lost the war or were about to lose it. 
</P>
<P>
 But due largely to the amazing drama of an Indian rebellion at the end of the 
20th Century and Subcommander Marcos' mastery of media communications, the 
Zapatistas won a tremendous political battle -- initially described as 
"professionals in violence," they became leaders and representatives of a 
social struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 This transformation was clearly visible during the peace negotiations held in 
the Cathedral of San Cristobal de las Casas. It was there that Commander 
Ramona, a small, discrete and outspoken woman, and Subcommander Marcos, with 
harsh verbal assaults -- albeit too ironic and lyrical -- established their 
ascendancy over such personalities as Bishop Samuel Ruiz Garcia and the 
government representative, Manuel Camacho Solis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Zapatistas rejected the government's peace plan mainly because it did not 
satisfactorily deal with indigenous problems. But their rejection also revealed 
their unrealistic reasoning. The Zapatistas are, in effect, asking for the 
resignation of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, a new transitional 
government and a new Congress. In Marcos' words, "we demand democracy, liberty 
and justice -- demands that will give a voice to the voiceless, a face to the 
faceless, a tomorrow for those who have no tomorrow, and life in our death." 
</P>
<P>
 In its ultimate truth, this rhetoric continues to be moving. But from the 
perspective of the Mexican majority, it is rationally unsustainable. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, it is clear that the mass media and the public were wrong to believe that 
the Zapatistas, in January, did not mean what they literally said. They 
voluntarily exposed themselves for the cause and thus have rejected any other 
motivation. The Zapatistas are genuine in their patriotism, precisely because 
they are willing to give their life for the cause. But the war in Chiapas 
affects many other sectors and other communities in the area that disagree with 
the Zapatistas. 
</P>
<P>
 Demanding the impossible from the government is understandable, if everything 
is reduced to ideology and principle and a refusal to be cheated. But it is 
highly questionable if the process involves so many lives and the 
democratization of the country. What is the meaning of statements like: "By 
suicide or firing squad, the death of the current Mexican political system is 
absolutely necessary, albeit not sufficient, for a transition to democracy in 
our country"? 
</P>
<P>
 Who placed the Zapatistas in the role of arbiters and guarantors in the 
transition to democracy? Self-professing their higher moral authority, they 
dare to lecture the Democratic Revolutionary Party; they invent and enthrone an 
organized "Civil Society" ("The Civil Society has assumed the role of 
preserving our patriotism. . . . We ask this Civil Society to retake its role 
as the protagonist and to organize itself to create a peaceful transition to 
democracy, liberty and justice"), and they persist in placing themselves in 
tragic scenarios: The Zapatistas cannot accept an undignified peace and they 
repeat the words of national hero Vicente Guerrero: "To live for the motherland 
or to die for liberty." Or as Marcos said, choosing their last stand: "They ask 
us to be prudent in surrendering and to live. . . . Who could live with that 
shame? Who could exchange life for dignity?" 
</P>
<P>
 I share many of the Zapatista grievances -- the high-level corruption, the 
imperial presidency, the state party, the terrible abandonment of indigenous 
communities and the rejection of democracy -- and I admire their sense of 
community. But I cannot understand, nor do I accept, their obstinate fixation 
with death, their posing as national representatives, their belief that an 
armed conflict is one of the ways to change -- they declared themselves the 
hope with a trigger . . . "the prophecy of the southeast" -- are unacceptable 
when not unfathomable. I do not share their expectation that there will be a 
National Democratic Convention to establish a transitional government. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, there are many possibilities left to explore. Dialogue will be 
restored, and the Zapatistas have ordered their forces to maintain the 
cease-fire "to permit the Civil Society to organize." And they have respected 
the five-month truce. This is crucial. It could create an opportunity to 
consolidate a peace agreement with dignity rather than continuing with 
power-grabbing from the Establishment and with doomsday attitudes from people 
who retain the enthusiasm of many.*

LOS ANGELES TIMES INTERVIEW; KOFI ANNAN; THE SOFT-SPOKEN ECONOMIST WHO RUNS 
U.N. PEACEKEEPING FORCES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Stanley Meisler, Stanley Meisler is The Times correspondent at the United 
Nations. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations does no more vital work these days than peacekeeping. The 
official in charge of the Blue Helmets and Berets -- as peacekeepers are known 
-- might be expected to be a blustery general renowned for his valor or cunning 
in some great battle. But it is Kofi Annan, 56, an unassuming Ghanaian 
economist and financial manager who is undersec retary-general in charge of 
peacekeeping, who heads the operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Annan is the fifth U.N. peacekeeping chief -- and the first from the Third 
World. None, however, had an empire to compare with his. With the Cold War 
ended and the Security Council no longer paralyzed by Russian and U.S. vetoes, 
the numbers of peacekeeping missions have mushroomed. Annan now runs 17 -- with 
70,000 troops and police at an annual cost of $3.2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 His biggest problem these days, however, is putting together missions in the 
wake of Somalia and President Bill Clinton's Policy Directive 25. The debacle 
in Somalia -- with 18 U.S. Rangers dying in a single raid during the manhunt 
for warlord Mohammed Farah Aideed -- made many countries, especially the United 
States, wary of peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 And the policy directive insists that the United States will not support a 
peacekeeping operation unless it meets a half-dozen conditions -- including a 
timetable for withdrawal, a cease-fire in place, an acceptable level of risk 
and a clear goal. The directive implies that the most powerful member of the 
United Nations has little enthusiasm for peacekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 Although U.S. policy now cramps Annan, he is popular among Americans, and U.S. 
officials encouraged Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali to put him in 
charge of peacekeeping in 1992. Annan speaks softly, barely above a whisper, 
but it is worth straining to hear him. He is a clear-minded, thoughtful man 
with a reputation throughout the United Nations for speaking frankly. 
</P>
<P>
 He infuriated several African ambassadors, for example, when he told the 
French newspaper Le Monde in late May that he has had trouble recruiting 
African peacekeepers because African governments "probably need their armies to 
intimidate their own populations." 
</P>
<P>
 Annan, married with three children, was educated at Ghana's University of 
Science and Technology, Macalester College in Minnesota, the Institut des 
Hautes Etudes Internationales in Geneva and the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology. His entire career has been with the U.N. system, working in various 
administrative jobs in Addis Ababa, Geneva, Cairo and New York.  
</P>
<P>
 Annan works in a spacious office on the 37th floor of the Secretariat building 
in U.N. headquarters, one floor below the secretary-general. Annan's office, 
where he recently sat down to talk about his work, is decorated with a few 
select pieces of African sculpture, notably from the Ivory Coast and Senegal. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: You're having more and more trouble getting troops for peacekeeping. 
Can you explain what the problem is?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Yes, we are encountering considerable difficulties in finding 
well-trained and equipped troops for the assignments that the (Security) 
Council has given us. This is partly due to perceived dangers the governments 
see associated with these operations, which are supposed to be peacekeeping but 
. . . where there's really no peace to keep . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Here I am looking at situations like Bosnia and Rwanda. I think that, as 
hesitant as everybody is about going in, nobody says don't do anything. And 
yet, when you turn around and ask, "How many troops would you give?" -- each 
one is prepared to volunteer the other person's army, the other country's army 
and, if necessary, to make some financial contribution. It's a problem that we 
need to try and resolve quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Everyone says that since Rwanda is Africa's concern, we should get African 
troops. But when you spoke to the Senate recently, you said if you wanted 
troops quickly, the Organization of African Unity was not the place to go. What 
did you mean?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Basically, what I meant was that we had a situation that required immediate 
and urgent action. What was required in that situation was a quick and rapid 
reaction force . . . . The presence of that force -- determined to protect 
vulnerable groups of people -- would have made a difference in the violence. We 
were not dealing with a group of well-organized and well-trained armies. The 
militias are using machetes and other weapons to kill. The presence would have 
made a difference, and we could have saved some people . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But that kind of force is not available to any of the African countries. The 
only African country . . . that does have that force is South Africa and it was 
too soon -- it was immediately after their independence (to ask them). 
</P>
<P>
 Q: And you never got the quick reaction force in there.  
</P>
<P>
 A: We never got the quick reaction force, and every day that the governments 
examined whether to contribute troops or not -- and here I'm talking about both 
Western and African countries -- more people lost their lives. And as late as 
it is, we can still make a difference if we can go on in. . . . We have offers 
from Ghana, Zimbabwe, Senegal, Ethiopia and Nigeria. But they don't come with 
the requisite equipment. So now we are passing the hat around, looking for 
equipment. We are talking to the U.S., the French, the British and the South 
Africans. Trying to marry the men and equipment does take time -- as we have 
learned through our attempt to get German equipment for the Pakistanis before 
they go to Yugoslavia. That has taken about nine months to a year. I hope this 
doesn't take that long. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are you slowed down in recruitment by President Clinton's new directive?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think the role and the attitude of the U.S. always has an effect. It has 
a leadership role. It is the only superpower now . . . . You saw in Somalia -- 
when the U.S. went in, lots of other governments followed. In the Gulf, when 
the U.S. led, lots of others followed. In Somalia, when the U.S. left, they 
left, too. And even in Bosnia, the European governments are saying if there is 
a cease-fire and we have to put in a force of about 75,000, we would want the 
U.S. to lead it . . . . So when the country with that dominant role and 
position takes a back seat and begins to hold back, it has an impact on the 
attitude of other nations. 
</P>
<P>
 But that having been said, nobody would disagree with . . . the U.S. . . . 
when they say there should be some guidelines for the council to determine when 
they take on a crisis and when they do not -- provided it's applied in a 
flexible and practical manner.  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let me take you back to Somalia. When you look at it now, what do you think 
was the greatest error in the operation?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think one of the errors was perhaps the decision to attempt to arrest 
Aideed and, in doing so, to be seen by some as going against . . . Aideed's 
troops. In these situations . . . the impartiality of the force and the 
principle of consent of the parties are crucial. If you are perceived to be 
fair, you do not run the danger of being engaged. If you are seen as taking 
initiatives that could change the military balance on the ground and favor one 
group or the other, the troops who see themselves as disadvantaged might decide 
you've taken sides and declare war on you. And this is what happened . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In Somalia, we did cross that line, and once you cross the line, it's 
extremely difficult to turn back to that neutral, consensual approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you now feel that the Somalia experience, for whatever reason, has 
crippled peace enforcement?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I would say that categorically, without any difficultly, that yes, the 
Somalia experience has . . . . I don't think the member states have the stomach 
for this type of operation. It's going to be a very long time before the U.N., 
as an organization, takes on a peace-enforcement mission and manages it itself. 
My sense is that if there is going to be another enforcement mission, that it's 
likely to be the Desert Storm model -- where the Security Council would 
authorize a group of member states to take all necessary means to correct or 
redress a situation. I don't think, as an organization, the Security Council 
will give a mandate to run an enforcement operation for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did you have higher hopes for peacekeeping when you took on this job two 
years ago?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think we all did. We all had higher hopes for peacekeeping. The Cold War 
was over. The new consensus in the council permitted agreement on operations 
that had not been possible. The council was breaking new ground, accepting the 
fact that the threat to peace is not necessarily a war between two states, but 
it could start from an internal conflict, which we've seen in Yugoslavia, or 
the Somalia one that throws refugees out and destabilizes its neighbors. Or 
even Haiti . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, we are also getting involved in situations where there were 
massive abuses of human rights or desperate humanitarian situations. So it was 
-- we were all expectant. It was thrilling, and we saw possibilities of doing 
perhaps, as somebody put it, what the organization was expected to do. So we 
were all excited. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let me take you to Bosnia and one sensitive matter there. Do you feel Mr. 
(Yasushi) Akashi, (the secretary-general's special representative), made a 
mistake in vetoing the NATO request for air strikes in the Gorazde incident 
last April?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I don't think so . . . . When the cease-fire had not gone into force, 
NATO requested that we should go in and use air power. Akashi -- and here it 
wasn't just Akashi -- Akashi, Lt. Gen. (Michael) Rose, the commander in Bosnia, 
and Gen. (Bertrand) de Lapresle, the force commander, unanimously decided that 
it was the wrong thing to do. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did they decide it was the wrong thing to do? They had been sitting with 
the Serbs negotiating for 11 to 12 hours. And they had the sense that the Serbs 
would comply, meet the deadline. And that if the Serbs complied, they had 
arranged to introduce into Gorazde a U.N. force that would monitor the 
cease-fire line, would get into the city with medical help, to give assistance 
to the sick and wounded and also be there to verify and monitor the withdrawal 
of the Serbs. And if one started bombing immediately, this was not going to be 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, their predictions were right. The Serbs did withdraw, with some 
minor problems . . . . We achieved the results we all wanted without fighting. 
If you don't have to fight to win, why fight? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But, whether justified or not, did the veto hurt the image of the United 
Nations?  
</P>
<P>
 A: It did hurt the image of the U.N. And I don't think the discussions and the 
information should have been leaked. If (the U.N.) had its own air wing, all 
discussions would have been internal. It is not unusual in a military situation 
for the commander to discuss all options and the majority of the commanders to 
say we are not going on this.  
</P>
<P>
 It is regrettable that such sensitive matters are discussed openly and get 
leaked. In fact, in some countries this would be grounds for court-martial. In 
fact, I made the point that if the Serbs and Bosnian army discussed their 
strategy openly in the press and in public, it would make the work of (the 
U.N.) and NATO very easy. (Laughter) 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You don't have a military background. Do you feel at a disadvantage in not 
having a military background in this field?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No, I don't find it a particular disadvantage. I don't think it has kept me 
from carrying on my role. I have learned a lot. I have very good military 
people with me. And perhaps in some situations, it is even an advantage. You 
ask questions, you don't take it for granted, and you don't know it all. So, in 
some ways, maybe it helps. It has not bothered me. 
</P>
<P>
 It's quite interesting now that I've been in this job for a while. You know 
the old adage, "War is too serious a matter to be left to the generals." Now 
that I'm in this job, I have discovered something else. The generals are saying 
that use of force is too serious a matter to be left to the civilians. 
(Laughter) 
</P>
<P>
 Q: They are very reluctant.  
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely, they are very reluctant, because they know the implications. 
Soldiers like to fight, but they don't like to declare war. It's fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If an American were in charge of U.N. peacekeeping, do you think the United 
States would be more enthusiastic about going into Rwanda?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I don't think so. I don't think it would make a difference. What makes a 
difference is the perception by the leaders as to the popular will. And Somalia 
did quite a lot of damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Having said that, I should also say that this is one area where we in the U.N. 
are very weak . . . with our public information. We are not able to tell our 
stories, not even our success stories. Both in Somalia and Bosnia, we had 
difficulties. But we've also made enormous contributions . . . . We know that, 
unless we can get the public to understand what we are doing and to get public 
support, we will not get the political will that we expect from the leaders.*

LAPD CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We must get a prompt and reasonable settlement of the contract dispute with 
the rank and file men and women of LAPD. Each day that passes results in more 
rancor and evident personal umbrage. The perception of disrespect and seeming 
lack of concern for each other's well-being results in enmity. Unfortunately, 
that includes not just the negotiating teams but the City Council, the mayor, 
the officers on the street and the rest of us -- ordinary citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 The trick, though, is to determine what is "reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 I don't know specific numbers but here are some things I consider when 
thinking about officer pay. 
</P>
<P>
 I want the best people we can get. I don't want the best working for San Jose 
or San Diego. I want them with good judgment, good training, dedication to the 
city and respect for my neighborhood. That's a lot to ask. 
</P>
<P>
 I've always felt that to ask for the very best from my employees, the 
reciprocal responsibility was to pay the best. Of course, there have been times 
when I've had to admit I couldn't pay top, realized it and asked for top 
performance anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 I cannot comment specifically where the money might come from. I know that I 
am willing to forgo a lot of service in order to have responsive police 
attention to my neighborhood. I can sweep my own street, but I cannot apprehend 
a felon. Maybe we could sell off part of a land-rich golf course. Perhaps we 
should collect the millions in unpaid business license taxes. Perhaps we should 
delay hiring more police until we adequately take care of the ones we have.  
</P>
<P>
 PATSY CARTER

<P>

</P>
<P>
 * I heartily approve of a raise for LAPD, especially for patrol officers who 
are now performing a more complex and dangerous job than they did even two 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the more I follow the negotiations between the city and the police 
union, the more I favor incentives for Los Angeles police to live in Los 
Angeles, so they will have a stake in the city beyond just their paychecks. 
</P>
<P>
 PHILLIP WESLEY 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles 
</P>
<P>
 * Why not restructure LAPD's overly generous retirement benefits so that 
retirement after 20 years of service would become infinitely less attractive 
financially than hanging in for 30? For those officers who experience "burnout" 
after 20 years on the street, there are plenty of desk jobs they can fill. 
</P>
<P>
 If the LAPD would shake its "them against us" mind-set, it would find that the 
rest of the work force in Los Angeles isn't nearly as well paid as police 
officers, nor do other workers of comparable skills retire in their early 40s 
with benefits for life. It is indeed sad to see the motto "Protect and Serve" 
degenerate into "Whine and Threaten." 
</P>
<P>
 JACK BAILEY 
</P>
<P>
 Studio City 
</P>
<P>
 * The Los Angeles City Council does not seem to understand that the city pays 
too much for most city services and too little for our police officers. Council 
members have opposed privatization of city services, saying that such an action 
would lower wages and "balance the budget on the backs" of certain city 
workers. Yet at the same time, they have had no qualms about "balancing the 
budget on the backs" of underpaid Los Angeles police officers, as they've done 
for years. 
</P>
<P>
 With the city in a budget crisis, it seems patently unfair to pay garbage 
collectors above-market wages and police officers below-market wages. Not only 
that, this is clearly out of line with what the citizens of Los Angeles want. 
The top priority must be safe streets, and that depends on good police service.

 * Re " 'Blue Flu': Expensive Epidemic," editorial, June 1: 
</P>
<P>
 You bring out some good points, but you fail to mention one fact. Last year 
the voters, in good faith, approved making the extra half-cent sales tax 
permanent. This revenue was to go to law enforcement and fire protection. I'm 
sure it does, but an equal amount of "other" money is taken away. Net gain for 
law enforcement -- zero. When will the voters wake up? Let's find out where 
this money is going. Get it back, and give it to the police and fire 
departments as it was intended.

 * If the centerpiece of David Roberti's campaign was "Gun control = Crime 
control," then I think that policy can finally be considered dead, along with 
his political career. (Are you listening, Sen. Feinstein?) 
</P>
<P>
 He may have legislated as many Democrats into being felons as he did 
Republicans with his much-touted "assault rifle law" and they were just as 
angry as we are. (Are you listening, Sen. Feinstein?) 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps he spent so much money running against the much-maligned National 
Rifle Assn. in his recall that he didn't have anything left for the primary. 
(Are you listening, Sen. Feinstein?) 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Feinstein, you better take heed. The NRA is growing and NRA Grassroots 
Members Councils are springing up in every town.

 * In regard to Roberti's recent defeat in the primary race for state 
treasurer, one might be able to accept his rationale of lack of funds at first. 
But a perfunctory analysis of the raw vote totals of Los Angeles County 
Democrats shows that Roberti lost by more than 18,000 votes in the county where 
his district is located. This alone would indicate that his defeat was not 
primarily related to an inability to pay for publicity statewide. Rather, it 
seems more related to the thorough understanding of his message and record by 
those in his own party who know him best. Other politicians should reflect on 
this possibility as well.

HELP FOR QUAKE VICTIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In the June 5 article ("50,000 Quake Victims Await Action on Aid 
Applications"), The Times described the distressing situation of property and 
business owners who are still awaiting aid decisions or have been denied 
assistance. One of the reasons given by SBA assistant administrator Bernard 
Kulik for the many denials was that "people are just plain debt heavy." For 
owners of residential property located in the City of Los Angeles, the city's 
housing department has good news. 
</P>
<P>
 In cases where the Small Business Administration (SBA) or the Individual 
Family Grant Program (IFGP) have denied a loan application, or can only 
partially fund the repairs that are necessary, Los Angeles Housing Department 
has programs that can help. For apartment buildings and single-family homes, 
LAHD is providing very low-interest rehabilitation loans, we are willing to 
subordinate to all other debt and there is no equity requirement. Approximately 
$89 million in federal funds have been allocated to LAHD for these programs. 
</P>
<P>
 To speed the process along, the LAHD, SBA and IFGP have worked out an 
application referral process so that full or partial rejections are referred to 
the city for assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, property owners are encouraged to call LAHD at (800) 
994-4444 during business hours.

 * Your article "Methods to Fix High-Rise Steel Fail Stress Test," (June 6) is 
misleading about concrete buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-ductile concrete structures have not been built in Southern California for 
more than 20 years. The codes were changed following the 1971 San Fernando 
earthquake, and post-1973 structures can be considered ductile. In general, 
post-1973 concrete structures performed quite well during the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, steel buildings constructed within the last five years, for 
example, the Automobile Club of Southern California building in Santa Clarita, 
suffered extensive damage. 
</P>
<P>
 As the article does not make the distinction between ductile and non-ductile 
buildings -- and it's a major one -- the implication is that all concrete 
buildings are non-ductile. This is simply not true. Further, many older 
concrete buildings have been retrofitted to meet the revised codes, and these, 
too, performed quite well.

SPECIAL EDUCATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * As the author of a bill to restructure the Los Angeles Unified School 
District, I am disappointed by your article dealing with the tough questions of 
how to pay for "categorical programs" like special education. 
</P>
<P>
 In an in-depth article ("Allocation of School Funds Spurs Competing Demands," 
June 2), The Times focused on $212 million, or about 6% of the district's 
$3.9-billion budget, which is being spent on special education and integration 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 My bill in the state Legislature, AB 1635, would fundamentally change the way 
in which the LAUSD spends money. The district would only get 5% to pay for 
administration, with the remaining 95% going to the local school sites. 
</P>
<P>
 AB 1635 makes sure that money for special education and other "categorical" 
programs follows the pupils in a flexible way that gives our schools autonomy. 
The administration could hold back no more than 10% of that money, for 
buildings and other districtwide costs. This is a tremendous improvement over 
how those funds are budgeted now. 
</P>
<P>
 The taxpayers are tired of paying for a huge bureaucracy and it's no wonder 
that the debate over Los Angeles Unified is stormy. Had The Times given my bill 
a good look, you could have told people that a broad new solution is in the 
works.

A GOOD PLACE TO BEGIN THE WELFARE DEBATE; CLINTON PUTS A PROMISING REFORM PLAN 
ON THE TABLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton wants to strike a tough-love bargain with young welfare 
mothers. Go to school or work at a government-subsidized job and get aid as 
long as it is needed. Refuse to do so and lose assistance after two years. This 
demanding approach -- if properly funded and carefully monitored -- has the 
beginnings of a pretty good deal for both welfare mothers and taxpayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Washington can't afford to train all 5 million welfare recipients and 
put them to work at once, the Administration targets young parents born after 
1971. This approach centers on the recipients who otherwise normally would 
spend much of their lives on welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration would spend $9.3 billion over five years for the job 
training, child care, health care and government jobs of last resort. Much of 
that money would be diverted from aid to poor, elderly or disabled immigrants 
who though not citizens are here legally. We hope the California congressional 
delegation will press for less punitive financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Deadline: "Two years and off the dole" would motivate young parents. But 
this deadline -- reasonable for the best-educated and most ambitious welfare 
recipients -- would unfairly penalize illiterate and unskilled mothers, who 
need more time to become employable. Rather than extend the deadline, Congress 
should allow states to tailor timetables to local employment situations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Work: Obviously, there will not be enough jobs available in the private 
sector, so government must provide some subsidized jobs. Washington must also 
guarantee health care to ensure that recipients who go to work are not punished 
with a loss of medical coverage for their children, a major benefit of being on 
welfare. The Clinton plan provides child care for participants during their 
training and their first year on the job. That's fine as far as it goes, which 
isn't far. What would happen to parents stuck in minimum-wage jobs and unable 
to pay for adequate child care? 
</P>
<P>
 Deadbeat Dads (and a Few Moms): 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton plan would require hospitals, and women who want welfare, to 
establish paternity at birth. Those fathers who did not support their children 
would be subject to reasonable punishments, such as loss of wages and 
suspension of professional, occupational and driver's licenses. This is an 
improvement over past attempts at welfare reform that pressured mothers but let 
fathers off the hook. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton warns that in 10 years more than half of all children will 
be born to unwed mothers unless current trends are reversed. To discourage 
teen-age pregnancy the Administration would fund prevention programs and 
teen-age mothers would be required to live with their parents and stay in 
school. Good. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pay-Off: California's Greater Avenues to Independence (GAIN) proves that 
taxpayers can benefit from welfare reform that truly works. In Riverside 
County, which has the best of the state's county-based workfare programs, a $1 
public investment yields an impressive $2.84 return and increased earnings for 
recipients.  
</P>
<P>
 Washington may not tackle welfare reform this year before members of Congress 
rush home to campaign for reelection. Given those political realities, 
President Clinton could have dragged his feet on welfare while dealing with the 
congressional hurdles faced by his health care reform. He did not. He put on 
the table a tough plan that is a good place for Republicans and Democrats to 
start the debate.

CALLING A CRIME A CRIME; FOR BOTH MORAL AND POLITICAL REASONS, WORLD MUST ACT 
ON U.N. REPORT ON BALKANS ATROCITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United Nations on June 2 issued its final report on war crimes in the 
former Yugoslavia. The report accused Bosnia's Serbs of crimes against 
humanity, especially in the once mainly Muslim, now "ethnically cleansed" town 
of Prijedor in northwest Herzegovina. Of the slaughter or expulsion of more 
than 50,000 of Prijedor's people, the report said, "It is likely to be 
confirmed in court under due process of law that these events constitute 
genocide." 
</P>
<P>
 But will there be a trial? The heavily documented report has been forwarded to 
the tribunal established in The Hague to try those indicted, but the U.N. 
Security Council has not named a top prosecutor, and the report has been all 
but ignored in the world press. Britain and France reportedly believe that the 
prosecution of war criminals must not be allowed to impede a peace settlement. 
The United States, which once called Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic a war 
criminal in so many words, may now, tacitly, be deferring to its European 
allies. 
</P>
<P>
 But the presence of presumptive war criminals in positions of authority in the 
breakaway Serb republics adjacent to official Bosnia-Herzegovina is not just a 
moral issue. It also bears directly on the political question of whether the 
international community can reasonably recognize those republics and compel 
affected Muslims and Croats to submit to their rule. 
</P>
<P>
 Trying to set war crimes aside as a secondary political issue in the Balkans 
is like trying to set terrorism aside as a political issue in Northern Ireland. 
It is rather less reasonable to expect Muslims and Croats to submit to rule by 
Karadzic than it would be to expect Ulster Protestants to submit to rule by 
Irish Republican Army leader Gerry Adams. Whatever the salons of diplomacy may 
decree on a point like this will inevitably be overruled by terrified people on 
the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something deep in human nature that wants to look away from atrocity. 
Unfortunately, maintaining a discreet silence about the war crimes report would 
be not only a moral disgrace but, in the long run, a political blunder.

ON A QUIET NIGHT, REMEMBERING DAD; THERE IS A PLACE IN EVERY CHILD'S LIFE THAT 
ONLY A FATHER CAN FILL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GARY E. MURPHY, Gary E. Murphy of Simi Valley is a high school vice 
principal. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I think my dad was a hero. Who doesn't? In between the periods when I hated 
him, I thought he was a hero. And I do today. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born before the Depression, trapped in an Old World mentality, and 
through some tremendous trick was forced to deal with an entirely new one. 
Think about it. When my dad was in his late teens, he was dancing to Jimmy 
Dorsey and Glenn Miller. When he had a son in his late teens (only 25 years 
later), he had to endure the Beatles, the Rolling Stones and the Who. The 
Stones, the Who and three-quarters of the Beatles are still touring. Dorsey and 
Miller were gone before my dad was 25. 
</P>
<P>
 See what I mean? The world changed faster for him. No wonder he never said 
anything. His life was a constant fast-forward. Still, I wish he had said 
something I could remember on a quiet night like this. 
</P>
<P>
 But my old man (I used to hate it when he called himself that; now that's all 
I can call him) weathered the storm. He handled the sexual revolution. (Once, 
in the car, he asked me if I needed to know anything about girls. I said no. We 
were both relieved.) He handled the drug craze. (This was a no-brainer: I went 
to Catholic school where they scared the hell out of you to the point where you 
would never even think about taking any kind of a drug.) And he handled me 
growing up. So when I think of my old man with that look on his face like he 
wasn't quite sure exactly where he was, I think of him as a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 To be honest, my dad would have been lost without my mom. She was always the 
rock; strong enough to tie your ship to, but soft enough to stretch out on and 
take in a Cape Cod breeze. She was the one who went over spelling, vocabulary, 
history, math. My dad (like most men) would never have survived without my mom. 
She was his eyes and ears. She was his chief-of-staff. She decided what went to 
him and what didn't. It was important to stay in good with my mom. My dad made 
the money, but mom knew where it went. She was at the play rehearsals, the bake 
sales, the school picnics. She even hit batting practice to my little league 
team. My mom was the heart and soul of our family when I was growing up.  
</P>
<P>
 So why am I sitting here, thinking of my dad tonight? 
</P>
<P>
 It's because, no matter how incredibly wonderful a mother is, there is a 
little place in every boy's life that only a dad can fill. Even if he never 
lives up to expectations, even if he hasn't a clue about it, even if he goes 
through life looking like he doesn't know where heis half the time, somehow the 
boy fits him into a memory of having done a great job.  
</P>
<P>
 I have four children. I try every day to let them know how much I love them. 
Because I know that there will be nights like this for them, when they're all 
alone, it's quiet, and they'll be thinking about their old man.

PERSPECTIVES ON PARENTING; PROPERLY HONORING OUR FATHERS; DRUG ABUSE, GANG 
PARTICIPATION, ACADEMIC FAILURE AND PROMISCUITY ALL CAN BE TRACED TO THE 
ABSENCE OF DAD.

 As sure as the sun rises on the third Sunday of June, television news will 
contain one "cute" Father's Day feature on ugly ties and one serious feature on 
a politician scoring points by rounding up "deadbeat dads." Telephone companies 
will suffer through the year's highest volume of collect calls, (Mother's Day 
has a higher total volume) as children spend dad's money to thank dad for his 
money. And millions of fathers will try not to get too depressed about their 
second-class status as parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, both the left and the right are starting to notice that the social 
issue of our time is inadequate fathering. The best indicator of drug abuse, 
gang participation, promiscuity and academic failure is neither race nor 
income; it is fatherlessness. 
</P>
<P>
 Politicians like Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), administrators like 
former Secretary of Health and Human Services Louis Sullivan and social 
scientists like David Blankenhorn all tout the same message. Even the Atlantic 
magazine admitted that "Dan Quayle was right" when he criticized the promotion 
of fatherless childhood as just one more family option.  
</P>
<P>
 Family options are not all equal. Fathers give a unique and valuable 
contribution to the healthy development of children. While feminists persuaded 
some of us that a woman needs a man like a fish needs a bicycle, it turns out 
that a child needs a father like a fish needs water. 
</P>
<P>
 We can no longer afford the cost of squandering our fathering resources. The 
toll it takes in crime and welfare alone -- not to mention the non-monetary 
costs of emotionally scarred children and a crumbling social structure -- is 
bankrupting us. It is time to stop whining about male irresponsibility, 
myopically equating inadequate fathering with inadequate child support. It is 
time to stop complaining about "what's wrong with fathers" and start asking 
"what's wrong with how we treat fathers." 
</P>
<P>
 Had we intended to undermine fathering, we could not have done a better job 
than to devise our current policies. The Census Bureau reports that 
non-custodial mothers are far more "deadbeat" than noncustodial fathers, 
proving that the problem is not with fathers but rather with what the system 
does to noncustodial parents: It strips them of the rewards of parenthood while 
coldly enforcing the responsibilities.  
</P>
<P>
 People do not choose to become parents in order to shoulder 18 to 21 years of 
responsibilities. They become parents for the warmth of a family environment, 
for the joy of watching and helping a child to develop, for the immortality of 
passing along personal values. It is only in return for these rewards that 
parents are willing to pay the price of responsibility. Nevertheless, thanks to 
skyrocketing rates of children born out of wedlock and the routine 
discrimination against divorced fathers, at least half of all American fathers 
will be deprived of those rewards and will be reduced to being visiting 
wallets. 
</P>
<P>
 To be truly effective at undermining fatherhood, we would not just sabotage 
the legal relationship, contact and sense of parenthood as we already do, but 
we would also undermine the dignity and respect of fatherhood -- as we also do. 
Although the silly images of fathers in "The Life of Riley" and "Bringing Up 
Father" were once balanced with more positive images like "Father Knows Best" 
and "Ozzie and Harriet," fathers today are generally portrayed as bumbling at 
best and abusive at worst. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of 10,000 random television commercials -- 1,000 a year from 1984 to 
1993 -- found that whenever mothers and fathers were shown and one parent was 
designated as less competent, 100% of the less competent ones were fathers! 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Cosby, who used almost every episode of his top-rated show to pat himself 
on the back for enlightened attitudes, consistently showed himself and other 
fathers as buffoons. Indeed, despite his own character being a physician, his 
television wife was identified as the indisputable authority even on health 
matters within his own family. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as we cheated ourselves by depriving government and business of the full 
use of female talent, we cheat ourselves by depriving our children of the full 
use of male parental talent. If we are willing to take affirmative action to 
increase the flow of women into careers, we should at least stop taking 
affirmative opposition to the flow of men into the day-to-day lives of their 
children. Equal parental opportunity for men -- joint physical custody -- is 
the equivalent to equal employment opportunity for women. It should be 
legislated and enforced as such.

THE STATE; THE POLICE-WAGE DISPUTE IS ABOUT MORE THAN MONEY 
</P>

<P>
 The contract dispute between the Police Protective League and the city may 
finally be heading toward resolution after two years of often acrimonious 
negotiations. Along the way, the structural weaknesses of a government designed 
to diffuse power have been exposed -- again. Add to that a mayor eager to get 
things done, a City Council protective of its authority, a police culture more 
akin to that of an occupying army, a city mired in recession and a citizenry 
fearful of crime -- and you do not have the ingredients for easy compromise. If 
ever there was a reason to seriously consider reforming city government, it is 
how the police-contract dispute has been handled. 
</P>
<P>
 In all probability, Mayor Richard Riordan's efficiency as a manager and 
negotiator far exceeds the system's capacity to absorb it. In the eyes of one 
council member, Riordan is the most powerful mayor he has ever seen. Yet, that 
power is strictly political. It is not rooted in the City Charter. And therein 
lies a source of potential conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 When he thinks it is necessary, Riordan does not hesitate to bypass the formal 
power structure. He uses whatever resources he can, including people, to move 
aside barriers in order to communicate directly with the opposition. In doing 
so, he is guided by an intuitive understanding of what the dynamics of his 
opposition are. This skill made him a rich man and enabled him to get the city 
moving again after the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But Riordan's back-channel approach tends to set up a choice between getting 
things done or obeying the rules. On the one hand, there is a strong sense of 
urgency among city officials to nail down a police contract before the World 
Cup gets under way. On the other, they are concerned that elected officials not 
negotiate out of fear. As a result, relations between the mayor and the council 
during the police talks have had a roller-coaster feel to them. At the top, 
they have been united in their opposition to the police union's blackmail 
threats; at the bottom, Riordan has ignored the council's role in the 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, responsibility for a contract rests in the City Council, with the 
city's chief administrative officer doing the bargaining. Real negotiating 
power, however, resides in the Executive Employee Relations Committee, whose 
membership is the mayor, the president and pro tem of the council and the 
chairpersons of the budget and personnel committees. Yet, these five officials 
cannot seal the deal. Only the council can do that. 
</P>
<P>
 This has proved to be too small a box for a mayor like Riordan. No matter how 
persuasive and aggressive he has been as a member of the negotiating committee, 
he still has only one vote. And the City Council is certainly going to jealousy 
guard its contract responsibilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, this imbalance of authority produced a new twist. The city may 
not be able to afford Riordan's offer but the council naysayers apparently 
don't have enough votes to torpedo the contract. The mayor's quest to get 
something done may have been achieved by bending the rules of accounting, with 
the taxpayers possibly picking up the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even in the best of all worlds, the nature of the leadership in the 
Police Protective League and, beyond that, the culture of the Los Angeles 
Police Department are at odds with the goal of an urban police department 
charged with maintaining law and order. Clearly, there is division within the 
union that makes negotiating with it like talking to a two-headed dragon. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over money, at least in part, is one over control within the LAPD. 
In many ways, it is a surrogate for cultural tensions within the department and 
between the department and the city. No one knows how large the militant 
faction within the department is. Some long-time LAPD observers call them 
"radicals" and "rednecks." To use more neutral language, they are "middle-level 
management" -- the detectives and desk sergeants who made it off the street and 
part way up the command ladder. 
</P>
<P>
 The culture they and their former chief created is rough, undisciplined and 
deeply resentful of outsiders. It is manifested in roll calls at which 
lieutenants keep their mouths shut while officers blast off at anybody and 
anyone who annoys them. It is manifested in the police-abuse complaints of 
citizens. It was documented in the Christopher commission report. 
</P>
<P>
 These officers are angry, frustrated and probably fearful of the changes 
ahead, especially the prospect of returning to the streets to work with 
communities they know only in terms of random violence and gangs. They have 
been obsessed with matching, if not beating, the wage contract won by employees 
of the Department of Water and Power. In their single-minded pursuit of this 
objective, the rest of city has not mattered. They have behaved like an army 
that does not recognize the superiority of civil authority. The resulting loss 
of public support may further erode departmental morale. 
</P>
<P>
 If the mayor had broader authority to negotiate contracts with city employees, 
he could be held accountable for the outcome. The process would be more direct 
and would eliminate half the debate now going on about who said what to whom, 
and who overstepped which bounds. Attention would be focused on whether the 
deal was a good one. 
</P>
<P>
 The city simply does not have the luxury of sustaining its diffused authority 
and ambling decision-making procedures. It needs machinery that allows it to be 
able to make decisions, to allocate its limited resources and focus on the 
future. Short of that, the city may now face the prospect of giving cops a 
raise at the cost of reduced police protection.*

MAKING IT WORTH THEIR WHILE TO STAY; INCENTIVES: FIRMS THAT HAVE LOOKED AT

EFFORTS AND JUSTIFY THEIR DECISION TO REMAIN HERE.

<P>
 George Derby and his partner, Stephen Sellwood, have survived a host of horror 
stories that would scare any company out of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Their operation, All Metals Processing of Orange County Inc., was getting 
buried under onerous California regulations, high taxes and enough red tape to 
strangle the profits out of even the biggest blue-chip business. 
</P>
<P>
 The partners decided to talk with officials in four other states, with the 
idea of moving their Stanton metal finishing company and its 110 employees. But 
recently, with great reluctance, they spurned attractive offers and decided to 
stay put. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just too expensive to move, and we would have lost our customers," 
Derby said. "Now we're betting that in three to five years, this will be a 
viable, profitable business here." 
</P>
<P>
 Derby, like many business owners that have looked at greener pastures 
elsewhere, is hoping that state lawmakers and regulators like the South Coast 
Air Quality Management District will shed their hostile attitude, build on 
their budding business-friendly efforts and eventually justify All Metals' 
decision not to abandon the Golden State. 
</P>
<P>
 The general problem for business owners is that California, with stricter 
environmental and business regulations than other states, has become a world 
unto itself, said Doug Mills, vice president for Fender Musical Instruments, a 
maker of electric guitars and amplifiers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The crux of the issue is, do we move out of this area and become part of the 
rest of the world, or do we stay here and learn to survive," Mills said. "For a 
myriad of reasons, we decided to stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Through legislation and the use of so-called "red teams," state and local 
leaders have become increasingly effective at getting to disgruntled business 
owners quickly and easing such burdens as high electric costs or the quagmire 
of obtaining clean-air permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The red teams, especially, have become more efficient and visible in the last 
18 months in halting the flight of the state's industrial and commercial tax 
base. The teams are ad hoc groups of utility company executives and government 
officials, from the governor's office to the AQMD and local city halls. 
</P>
<P>
 Some companies that decided to stay in California rave about the efforts of 
the red teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "They really showed me that the state was trying to swing the pendulum back 
from how bad it was for business in the last four or five years," said Ron 
Kishen, plant manager for Avery Dennison Fasson. The self-adhesive paper maker 
decided last fall to keep its 120 employees in Rancho Cucamonga instead of 
moving the plant to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Trade and Commerce Agency, which leads the state's overall 
efforts at economic development, has been prodding the state Legislature, state 
agencies and local governments to pay more attention to the needs of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just as a company on a continuing basis looks at what it needs to grow and 
remain competitive, California and governments at all levels have to do the 
same thing," said Julie Meier Wright, who heads the agency. "Corporations 
continue to evolve, and government can do no less." 
</P>
<P>
 The agency, as well as the business community, is lobbying the Legislature to 
adopt new laws for the second straight year to give companies tax credits and 
relief from some of the nation's strictest laws. 
</P>
<P>
 But some lawmakers do not want to offer business incentives because they 
believe the cash-strapped state cannot afford it. Still, Gov. Pete Wilson has 
stashed away $110 million to pay for the first two years of a proposed 
five-year plan to give a 6% tax credit to big companies that generate new 
construction and new jobs. But the tax-credit bill so far is languishing in the 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 The regional air quality district, once one of the most intransigent state 
bureaucracies, also is changing its approach. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact of the matter is that we were starting to get dinged around pretty 
badly in the media, and we paused to consider the complaints," said Richard 
(Nick) Nikkila, an assistant deputy AQMD executive officer. "The more we looked 
at it, the more we realized these guys are taking some big hits out there." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Henry W. Wedaa, the South Coast agency's chairman, said the district is driven 
by state and federal clean-air laws but now is "doing things in moderation." He 
said the agency no longer can "simply pass rules without concern about the 
economy." Instead of dictating how to reduce certain emissions, for instance, 
it is letting companies find their own ways to do it. 
</P>
<P>
 Business owners notice the changing attitude, but some think Sacramento should 
do more to compete with the attractive benefit packages put together by such 
states as Texas and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
 Taco Bell Corp., which has been on a well-publicized yearlong search for new 
headquarters, was believed to be ready to announce that it would build a new 
home near its Irvine location. But it paused when a state Senate committee 
voted down the proposed 6% tax credit last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican-style, fast-food chain has missed three self-imposed deadlines to 
announce a decision. Now, the company is believed to be waiting to see if the 
state Legislature can resurrect the tax credit in a budget law expected at the 
end of the month. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Hughes Aircraft Co. is considering closing a Fullerton plant that 
employs 6,800 workers. The El Segundo-based company, suffering from the severe 
downturn in the defense and aerospace industries, has closed other plants in 
Southern California as it consolidated operations out of state. 
</P>
<P>
 Other companies, big and small, simply are not waiting for the state any 
longer. Thrifty Drug Stores fled Los Angeles in April for Oregon, and house 
component maker Heydon Building Systems, with four employees in Santa Ana, 
recently relocated to Tucson. 
</P>
<P>
 Heydon spokesman Peter Beher said he is upset with the state's efforts to 
"save" Taco Bell and its 1,000 jobs at the expense of smaller companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is they try to do a quick fix for the big company, but what 
needs to be fixed is the entire underlying structure," Beher said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got to remember that a small business has two employees today, but it 
becomes a five-man office, then a 10-man operation," he said. "California's 
future is encouraging small businesses . . . not trying to keep the big company 
by offering one incentive or another." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Companies like All Metals Processing, Avery Dennison Fasson, Fender Musical 
Instruments and Martin Molded Rubber Products in north Orange County certainly 
hope the state continues to improve business conditions. They are part of a 
group that, with little fanfare and for a variety of reasons, have decided to 
stick it out in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Mills said that a big reason for Fender's decision to remain in Corona was a 
red team's help in negotiating "reasonable solutions" to the company's air 
quality problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Fender moved from Brea three years ago without a comment from city officials. 
Now it is working with the city of Corona, the state and "people we didn't even 
know existed," Mills said, to determine ways to comply with air quality 
limitations on the use of paints and lacquers with ozone-depleting emissions. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California Edison's special Consumer Technology Application Center 
assisted Fender by finding manufacturers capable of producing paints that meet 
AQMD emissions standards. Edison also worked with the agency in testing and 
evaluating available coatings. Edison's tech center in Irwindale helps small 
and mid-size companies that do not have the expertise, time or money to 
research and test new methods of manufacturing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leaving the state is always an option," Mills said. "We want to be compliant 
with state regulations. There are technological advances in paint 
manufacturing, and the day will come when we will have no volatile paint 
emissions." 
</P>
<P>
 Fender now expects to add up to 300 employees by this fall in a new 
103,000-square-foot addition at its Corona facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet with workers' compensation premiums still higher than in other states and 
other restrictions on business operations here, Mills said, "Oklahoma doesn't 
look too bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Avery Dennison Fasson also praises a red team that worked to keep the 
company's plant in Rancho Cucamonga. Fasson, a subsidiary of Avery Dennison in 
Pasadena, employs about 120 people in the San Bernardino County plant to put 
adhesives on paper to be used as labels, tags, stamps and a host of other 
pressure-sensitive products. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Fasson's divisions, which makes rolls of adhesive paper, wanted to put 
a major plant in the West last year but looked to Phoenix instead of 
California. Division executives figured the cost of doing business in 
California was 14% to 16% higher than it would be in Arizona, said Kishen, 
Fasson's plant manager. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't exactly buy those numbers. I wanted to take another look at it," 
Kishen said, noting that if the rolled-paper division went to Phoenix, 
headquarters would follow. 
</P>
<P>
 He called the office of his state senator, Bill Leonard (R-Upland), and within 
15 minutes an Edison employee -- a member of that area's red team -- called 
back to ask about the problems Fasson faced and to set up a meeting the 
following week. 
</P>
<P>
 "They brought in just about everybody to that meeting," Kishen said. "There 
were people from the city, the county, the AQMD, the state and the utility 
companies. About 15 people were there to find out why we wanted to leave." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After Kishen detailed the problems -- sky-high workers' comp premiums, high 
wages, bureaucratic red tape, high utility bills -- he told them that the added 
costs amounted to a big penalty to do business here. 
</P>
<P>
 Within two months, the red team returned with a series of proposals and also 
kept the company informed of the legislation then winding its way through the 
state Legislature to reform workers' compensation laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals included ways to reduce all utility bills by 30% to 35%, Kishen 
said, which meant a savings of $250,000 a year. Soon, it became obvious that 
the added cost of doing business in California was not so high, certainly not 
high enough to justify the cost of relocating. 
</P>
<P>
 Kishen, however, did not contain his analysis to California. Turning to 
Arizona, he decided that the infrastructure -- roads, sewers and all the 
amenities needed to operate a sizable company -- was in poor shape. With rapid 
growth in the number of companies moving there, he said, state and local 
governments would have to start "taxing like crazy" to pay for improvements. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he pointed out, "there were a lot of reasons to stay here." Among 
those, he said, was that Southern California was a better distribution center 
for his company. Last fall, the company decided to remain at its Rancho 
Cucamonga plant, where the rolled-paper division will join it in January. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe the pendulum for business in California is now starting to swing the 
other way," Kishen said. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is, the state might want to amend workers' compensation laws again. 
</P>
<P>
 Reforms in the workers' comp system last year lowered premium rates by 17% at 
Martin Molded Rubber in La Habra, and "that's a help," owner Russ Martin said. 
But it is not enough, he said. If he decides to move in the future, "workers' 
comp will be the reason," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of his 20 employees only examine products, yet the company must pay the 
same workers' comp rate for them -- $16 per $100 in wages -- as it does for 
other employees engaged in actual manufacturing, where the risk of injury is 
much greater. The company produces gaskets and other rubber products for 
medical and aerospace products and for household appliances. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin is considering creating a second company that would employ the 
examiners and pay a drastically lower insurance premium -- 98 cents for every 
$100 in wages. 
</P>
<P>
 He also is looking for a bigger plant in Anaheim, where electricity rates are 
lower. Currently, he spends up to $5,000 a month during the summer on 
electricity, mainly for the heat machines needed to mold rubber. 
</P>
<P>
 "I looked at Carson City (in Nevada), and I can save $3,000 a month just on 
workers' comp rates and electricity," Martin said. "The only thing really 
stopping me from moving there is the fear of losing growth. I know I'm going to 
grow here." 
</P>
<P>
 He hopes to stay in Southern California, at least for five more years, but 
relocation remains an option. 
</P>
<P>
 But if any company had reason to leave the state, it would appear to be All 
Metals Processing, which paints and coats finishes on a variety of metals, from 
golf clubs to medical instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Partner George Derby said that after battling with workers' compensation laws 
and numerous air quality regulations, the company was hit this year by a 
special 6% city tax on utilities that is costing it more than $500 a month just 
in added electricity costs. 
</P>
<P>
 But the company's woes stem mainly from air quality regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, for instance, has a permit to use 17 gallons of special paint to 
coat metals. It had a chance to land a big golf club contract that would have 
added six additional employees to its 110-member work force and $40,000 a month 
in revenue. But AQMD bureaucrats refused to allow any expansion of its existing 
metal painting operations, Derby said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, air quality officials told him that All Metals could open a new metal 
processing plant across the street, obtain a permit for that operation and then 
merge the companies. That, he said, was time-consuming, expensive and 
unreasonable. Eventually, All Metals could not sign the contract and lost the 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 AQMD has also vetoed a number of other plans, Derby said, including a request 
to reinstall a hazardous-waste treatment machine All Metals wanted to buy from 
another company. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the kinds of things that are making us feel we can't survive," 
Derby said. "The recession is wasting us away, profit margins are down, and 
California wants to beat on you and never let go. It's amazing." 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has met often with AQMD officials, agency staff and local 
politicians, but laws and rules have stymied them. 
</P>
<P>
 Edison, though, helped the company by providing rebates for cheaper lighting 
and new heating and air-conditioning components. The savings in electric bills 
over the next 1 1/2 years will cover the cost of the new equipment, Derby said. 
</P>
<P>
 The partners had entreaties from 17 states to move their operations out of 
California. They negotiated with cities in Colorado, Missouri, Nebraska and 
Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all said we were clean and complied with federal regulations," Derby 
said. "Some were going to build us a building-to-suit (for lease). One year's 
rent would have been one month's here." 
</P>
<P>
 But the costs of moving the heavy machinery and disposing of hazardous 
chemicals proved to be so prohibitive that the company could not even relocate 
to Santa Ana, where a specially designated enterprise zone could have cut the 
company's costs. The company would have had to spend $2 million -- or 40% of 
its annual revenue -- to move. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a machine shop, I'd be out of here," Derby said. "We have every 
reason to move and no ability to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, he and his partner will likely sell the company to the employees 
over time through an employee stock ownership plan.

JAMES FLANIGAN: POWERFUL BOND MARKET IS DUE FOR A REALITY CHECK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Suddenly, something called "the bond market" has become a bogyman, said to be 
exerting a baleful influence on national policy and holding back economic 
growth lest inflation increase. 
</P>
<P>
 A hot new book on the Clinton Administration, "The Agenda" by Bob Woodward, 
reports that the President was surprised and angered to learn upon taking 
office that the success of his economic program hinged on financial markets or, 
as he is quoted, "on the Federal Reserve and a bunch of ------- bond traders." 
</P>
<P>
 The book suggests that Clinton would have boosted the economy, accelerating 
job creation, were it not for fears that bond traders would send interest rates 
skyward. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street exhibits similar fears today. The bond market's reactions to 
economic growth last week were credited or blamed for stock prices rising or 
falling. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's all half-truths and nonsense, akin to ancient Romans consulting 
chicken entrails and dreams to predict the future. Commentators in our own day 
have previously focused on the money supply, unemployment statistics, the 
behavior of Japanese or Arab investors to explain and predict the giant U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 What is seldom said is how often such indicators, which depend on context and 
interpretation, can be wrong. Caesar's wife, Calpurnia, troubled by a dream, 
warned Julius not to go to the Senate on the Ides of March. But soothsayers 
called her dream a positive indicator, so Caesar went and was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Today bond traders are pushing up interest rates on fears of rising inflation 
and are said to act like a throttle on growth and job creation. 
</P>
<P>
 But that interpretation ignores several realities: that evidence of inflation 
in the real economy is debatable; that the bond market itself is partly 
distorted by trading in derivatives, and, most important, that the long-term 
outlook for the real economy is for disinflation and rising productivity, a 
reality the bond market seems to miss. 
</P>
<P>
 What's the relation of the bond market to the real economy? That of a banker 
to a business owner. What we call the bond market represents the worldwide 
trading of government and private debt, including roughly $4 trillion in U.S. 
Treasury bills, notes and bonds. Bond investors, including your pension and 
mutual funds, literally are lending money. So traders strive to keep interest 
high enough that inflation doesn't erode principal. 
</P>
<P>
 By doing so, they affect global interest rates, including the rate for your 
mortgage or personal loan. But that doesn't mean that every nick in interest 
rates stops a growing economy. Your mortgage and credit card debt doesn't limit 
what you can earn, after all, though making payments limits what you can spend. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1980s, economic growth ranged from minus 2% in the recession to 6.2% in 
1984 and back to 2.9% in '86. Yet mortgage rates stayed above 10% throughout 
the decade, according to statistics compiled by Advisers Capital Management, a 
New York-based investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Now mortgage rates are at roughly 8.3%, the economy is growing at more than 3% 
and housing starts are strong. No obstacle to growth in those statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 The inflation fears that have driven markets recently are centered on 
industrial commodities such as copper and other metals, which have risen in 
price from depressed levels. But that's looking at "the old industrial model," 
says Charles Clough, chief investment strategist for Merrill Lynch. He means 
that those commodities feed manufacturing industry, which is 20% of the 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 That's important, sure, but concentrating on commodities, the bond traders are 
overlooking other evidence -- such as that H.J. Heinz and other consumer goods 
companies have recently had to call off attempted price increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, there is abundant capital in banks, with no pressures on credit, and 
companies such as McDonald's, Coca-Cola and Toys R Us are using surplus capital 
to buy their own stock. That means they see no surging demand to open new 
stores or build new plants, and no investment looks better than their own 
companies -- which, like most U.S firms, have grown extremely efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 And that brings up the true liberating and encouraging outlook for the 
economy. The service industries -- transportation, communications, retailing, 
financial and business services, even medical services -- are showing gains in 
output without rising costs. Productivity, in a word. 
</P>
<P>
 A revolution in services has been building for years as more than $200 billion 
has been invested in computing and telecommunications, notes economist Stephen 
Roach of Morgan Stanley. Now the promise of all that investment is being 
realized. And that means the long-term outlook in the service sector, which 
accounts for two-thirds of U.S. economic output, is for rising productivity and 
disinflation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration understands this. The Council of Economic Advisers 
last week issued a study on the effects of phone deregulation on the 
telecommunications and computing industries. They projected a great flowering, 
with growth of 2 million telecommunications-related jobs by 2003.  
</P>
<P>
 Telecommunications and computing, the study found, would then compose more 
than 18% of the U.S. economy. Communications will far surpass automobiles as 
the biggest employer. 
</P>
<P>
 Will that be inflationary? On the contrary, it will be efficient and 
disinflationary -- while creating jobs. And that outlook argues for low 
interest rates and strong bond markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Make no mistake. We will still have problems to solve: education, poverty, 
race relations. But the bond market won't stop anybody from innovative 
solutions on such issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, the world changes. The old-fashioned way to boost the economy was by 
pumping in public spending. But that is not what Clinton's economic advisers 
are touting today. Rather, deregulation and industrial efficiency are seen as 
the real way to create 2 million jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 A revolution is occurring here. Does the bond market know this? Shouldn't it?

REVIVAL ON BROADWAY; WITH THE HELP OF WALT DISNEY CO., TIMES SQUARE IS STAGING 
A COMEBACK. BUT SOME FEAR THE LOSS OF THE DISTRICT'S SOUL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 For two decades after it opened in 1903, the New Amsterdam Theatre was nothing 
less than the high temple of popular entertainment in America. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's colorful social elite and the city's burgeoning middle class 
flocked to the spectacular Art Nouveau building on 42nd Street, eager to see 
the beautiful "girls" of the Ziegfield Follies, hear the latest musicals from 
Irving Berlin or drink and dance in the roof garden theater. 
</P>
<P>
 For the owners, the Theatrical Syndicate, the New Amsterdam was both a 
glamorous showcase and a creative launching pad -- the crucial link in a chain 
of more than 500 theaters across the country. And it firmly established 42nd 
Street and soon-to-be-named Times Square as the theatrical and entertainment 
center of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the once-proud New Amsterdam is a ruin, its cracking terra-cotta 
ornaments, faded murals and decayed plaster moldings forming a depressing 
metaphor for the decline of Times Square. It shares a block with eight other 
historic but crumbling theaters in a neighborhood better known locally for 
crack pipes than night life. 
</P>
<P>
 But city officials and business leaders are ecstatic over the prospect of a 
revived New Amsterdam -- one that would be an altogether different kind of 
metaphor for the "Crossroads of the World." 
</P>
<P>
 Walt Disney Co., with a big subsidy from the state of New York, has 
tentatively agreed to renovate and occupy the theater, a project that promises 
to boost a long-delayed and highly controversial effort to redevelop 42nd 
Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "With Disney coming, we have been bombarded with proposals from entertainment 
companies," says Rebecca Robertson, president of the New York state agency 
spearheading the redevelopment effort. "This is part of the renewal of our 
economy. Entertainment is a burgeoning business, New York has to be a part of 
that, and Times Square is a logical place for it." 
</P>
<P>
 If all goes according to plan, the area stretching from 42nd St. to 53rd St. 
and from 6th avenue to 8th Ave. will again be a colorful, exicting, and unique 
montage of interesting attractions and fascinating people. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it seems unlikely that Times Square can ever regain its place as the hub 
of the nation's entertainment industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, popular culture is driven by the movies, recorded music, fashion and 
the merchandising spinoffs those industries generate. New York, along with Los 
Angeles, is an important hub for all these businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 But the intricate cultural dynamics of the entertainment industry have changed 
radically since the glory days of Oscar Hammerstein, the Shubert brothers and 
the Theatrical Syndicate, which together with the New York Times invented Times 
Square. What the new Times Square can probably never be is the pre-eminent 
creative center, the trendsetter, the place to see and experience the new, the 
daring and the completely different. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a time when the musicians of Tin Pan Alley, the actors of the 
legitimate stage and the comedians of vaudeville were cultural beacons to the 
nation and the world -- among other things, feeding story lines and performers 
to the nascent movie business. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1990s, instead, comes the clean, ordered, family-oriented world of 
Disney, featuring carefully packaged entertainment such as "Beauty and the 
Beast," the theatrical version of the hit animated film that is currently 
playing to sellout audiences on Broadway. Today's theater audiences skew 
heavily toward tourists and suburbanites. Creative development, as often as 
not, takes place in California and many other places across the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "Instead of being a place to generate something, it's a place to see the end 
product," says Margaret Knapp, a professor of theater at Arizona State 
University who wrote a doctoral dissertation on the 42nd Street theaters. "It's 
a place to see the latest London musical or a play that was successful in 
another part of the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for New York City, reinventing Times Square as a vibrant entertainment 
showcase and a corporate home for the entertainment industry would represent a 
major economic boost -- and a big improvement over the status quo. 
</P>
<P>
 The glamorous night life and safe but sinful diversions of the old Times 
Square -- always as much myth as reality -- gave way decades ago to the 
incongruous mix of a staid Broadway theater culture on the one hand and a grim, 
drug-laced sex industry on the other. By the late 1970s, Times Square had 
become something of a civic embarrassment, with filthy streets and a sky-high 
crime rate. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, the city and state launched the 42nd Street redevelopment project. 
Like almost any major civic project in this contentious town, the effort 
quickly got bogged down in political bickering and lawsuits. And the economic 
slump in the late 1980s nearly killed it entirely. 
</P>
<P>
 But now the project is moving, just as private development efforts toward the 
northern end of Times Square are bearing fruit. The dark side, ruled by 
pornography and crime, is down if not out. Families and tourists and mainstream 
entertainment are in. 
</P>
<P>
 Public officials and local business folk can hardly contain their glee. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will be one of the wonders of the world," gushes restaurateur Artie 
Cutler, whose three new Times Square establishments have been playing to packed 
houses. "People from all walks of life will be coming here." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Disney, companies ranging from Warner Music to Madame Tussaud's 
Wax Museum are scrambling for space on 42nd Street. Bertelsmann Music Group, 
the German media giant, has bought a 52-story office tower in the heart of 
Times Square; Virgin Records will occupy much of the 150,000 square feet of 
retail space in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 At Viacom Inc.'s 56-story headquarters across the street, other tenants are 
being pushed out as Viacom absorbs Paramount Communications. David Letterman's 
CBS "Late Show," housed a few blocks up Broadway, is building a veritable cult 
around its neighborhood. Even the troubled theater business is enjoying a 
modest revival. 
</P>
<P>
 While the precise economic impact of all this is difficult to measure, it is 
clearly salutary. 
</P>
<P>
 For one thing, tourism is an increasingly important industry in a city that 
has been losing businesses of all stripes for years. Times Square has no less 
than 12,500 hotel rooms and 220 restaurants, and Broadway theaters generate 
$2.3 billion in local business, according to a recent study by the Port 
Authority of New York and New Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials and business leaders say the new, cleaned-up Times Square will 
be able to retain the diversity of uses -- and at least some of the colorful 
subcultures -- that have always made it unique. "Disney-fication," however, 
clearly has its dangers. Some here fear that the gains for the city's 
pocketbook will come at the expense of a part of its soul. 
</P>
<P>
 Cora Cahan, the ebullient president of New 42nd Inc., a nonprofit group 
charged with overseeing the renovation of six historic theaters, firmly rejects 
the notion that redevelopment means a bland, antiseptic Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
 "This street will be for everyone -- young and old, New Yorkers and tourists," 
she says. "We're looking for uses that don't replicate existing things, that 
are appropriate to New York and appropriate to New York as an entertainment 
center." 
</P>
<P>
 Gazing down at 42nd Street from Cahan's office, one would think she would be 
happy to find any uses at all. The long block between 7th and 8th avenues, the 
original heart of the theater district, is a bleak urban moonscape, home to 
dozens of empty buildings and boarded-up theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 At one end of the street is a clutch of X-rated video stores and peep shows, 
remnants of the 140 sex-related businesses that inhabited Times Square in the 
late 1970s. The sex industry has a long history in the area -- and arguably 
forms part of its appeal for some visitors -- but it is considered a pariah by 
the Establishment. The number of sex businesses now stands at just over 40, and 
efforts continue to whittle the number. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the rest of 42nd Street today, there are only blank marquees and 
crumbling facades, grimy reminders of a glorious but distant past. 
</P>
<P>
 That past began near the turn of the century, when theatrical entrepreneur 
Oscar Hammerstein -- in search of cheap land and confident that the city's 
theater district would continue to creep northward -- built the first theater 
in the district known as Longacre. 
</P>
<P>
 Live theater ruled the entertainment kingdom then, and New York ruled the 
theater. It was big business, big enough to support construction projects such 
as the Hippodrome, a three-stage complex that occupied an entire city block and 
seated 6,000. 
</P>
<P>
 New York producers such as Hammerstein (grandfather of the lyricist of 
"Oklahoma" and other musicals), together with the Shuberts and the half-dozen 
partners of the Theatrical Syndicate controlled thousands of theaters across 
the country, pioneering the so-called combination, or road show, with 
productions "direct from New York." 
</P>
<P>
 There were spectacular restaurants on Times Square too, such as Rector's; 
there were the "roof gardens" atop many of the theaters, where drinking and 
dancing went on to the wee hours, and on the side streets there were brothels, 
some so busy they had lines outside the doors. 
</P>
<P>
 But the heyday of legitimate theater and vaudeville -- the intimate art form 
that combined comedy, music and even acrobatics -- proved short-lived. 
</P>
<P>
 Prohibition was the first blow, altering the economics of live entertainment 
and driving many impresarios into bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The decisive change, however, was the arrival of motion pictures. By the 
1930s, the movies had thoroughly displaced the theater as the main form of 
popular entertainment, and most of the theaters on 42nd Street were converted 
to movie houses. In live performance, only burlesque -- the predecessor of the 
modern strip club -- continued to thrive. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, there was an intimate relationship between the film industry and 
Broadway. Movie palaces such as the Paramount and the Strand were the jewels of 
the theater chains, while creative talent crossed easily from one medium to 
another. And movies did much to create the mythology of Times Square. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, though, Hollywood became the undisputed center of the film 
business, and theater continued to wither. Once there were hundreds of major 
playhouses in New York; today, there are just 37 Broadway theaters, and about a 
third are dark at any given time. 
</P>
<P>
 Business has been relatively good this year, with total attendance at its 
highest level since 1988. Compared to the movie industry, though, Broadway 
theater is tiny,with less than $400 million a yearin revenue. And doomsayers 
fear that high costs, archaic union work rules and antiquated management 
practices assure a continued downward slide. 
</P>
<P>
 Some hope that Disney, as a powerful outsider, will shakethings up, perhaps 
taking on the unions and introducing more sophisticated promotion and marketing 
techniques. There have already been a few skirmishes with unions over "Beauty 
and the Beast." 
</P>
<P>
 But Broadway's problems run deep. "The new generation is not 
theater-oriented," laments Emanuel Azenberg, a prominent Broadway producer. 
"And we have an economic structure that is completely impossible. Seventy-five 
dollars to go to a musical? . . . A part of the American cultural scene is 
going away forever." 
</P>
<P>
 The premise of the redevelopment effort is that the cultural scene is simply 
changing, and that Times Square must put itself in the way of those changes. 
Nothing symbolizes that better than the 42nd Street project, conceived as a way 
to reclaim a historic block that succumbed years ago to peep shows, drug 
dealers and prostitutes of every description. 
</P>
<P>
 When the state Urban Development Corp. first put forth its blueprint back in 
1984, many of Times Square's denizens were horrified. The state proposed 
forcibly buying out the property owners on the block between 7th and 8th. Four 
key parcels at 42nd Street and 7th Avenue, the heart of Times Square, would be 
the sites for four massive office towers. 
</P>
<P>
 The towers were to be built by private developers, who would get tax breaks 
and pay the state $241 million, which in turn would be used to buy the other 
properties and finance the rehabilitation of the theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Philip Johnson-designed buildings were harshly criticized as too large 
and out of step with the spirit of the area; 47 lawsuits were filed to block 
the project. By the time those were resolved, the real estate and financial 
services depression of the late 1980s had ruined the market for office space in 
mid-town. Three new office towers toward the northern end of Times Square ended 
up in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, the city and state came up with an interim plan that delayed 
construction of the four office towers and put a renewed emphasis on retail and 
entertainment. It was well received, especially by those who had opposed the 
office towers in the first place. (The developers are expected to sign off on 
the plan later this summer.) 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the three bankrupt buildings became cheap enough to attract 
tenants: Two were acquired by Morgan Stanley and the third by Bertelsmann. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a critical question remained: Would private-sector retail and 
entertainment companies be willing to invest in 42nd Street -- especially in 
old theaters that would require extensive renovation? And what kind of terms 
would they demand? 
</P>
<P>
 A big part of the answer came in January, when Disney Chairman Michael D. 
Eisner, flanked by Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Gov. Mario Cuomo, announced that 
the entertainment giant would take over the New Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to get rid of the filth and bring back the old values," cooed 
Cuomo. "This is the beginning of a whole new era." 
</P>
<P>
 But Disney did not come cheap. The state will make a $21-million loan at 3% 
interest, while Disney will put up $8 million. And the deal is only 
preliminary; Disney still could walk away if the renovation proves too 
expensive or if the company isn't pleased with the way development on the rest 
of the block is proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's happening on the balance of the street is very important," says David 
Malmuth, senior vice president at Disney. "We need to have good neighbors." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Disney announcement did have its intended effect. Cahan and 
Robertson have been inundated with proposals for everything from nightclubs and 
music studios to virtual reality attractions. They refer to two periods in 
their redevelopment effort: BD (before Disney) and AD. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Cahan's organization is renovating the Victory Theatre, across 42nd 
Street from the New Amsterdam, for children's performances. And the arrival of 
thousands of new office workers is giving a big boost to the restaurant and 
retail businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Times Square is cleaner and safer and friendlier, but it hasn't lost its 
soul," says Gretchen Dykstra, president of the Times Square Business 
Improvement District. Her organization, whose street cleaners and security 
guards supplement the city's, is credited with helping the district's revival. 
</P>
<P>
 In the long run, Times Square could indeed end up a vibrant, economically 
successful mix of office buildings on the one hand and big retail stores and 
entertainment venues on the other. 
</P>
<P>
 But the challenge is whether it can do so without losing all that has made it 
unique. And soul can be in the eye of the beholder. Though the famous news 
"zipper" still circles the Times Tower, the building is vacant -- and may well 
be torn down to make way for Madame Tussaud's.

REACHING OUT; PACBELL ENLISTS LEGISLATURE IN LOBBYING FOR LONG-DISTANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONALD WOUTAT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pacific Bell, seeking a leg up in its campaign for the right to compete with 
long-distance companies such as AT&T and MCI, has found an important friend: 
the California Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 In a heavily lobbied bill that has everyone from AT&T to dozens of little 
phone companies and the Consumer Federation of America crying foul, PacBell has 
enlisted lawmakers squarely on its side in the emerging, theoretically 
free-market new world of telecommunications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The state of California ought to assert its right to protect its largest 
employer," says Assemblyman Jim Costa (D-Fresno), the bill's chief sponsor. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation, which sailed through the Assembly on a 61-1 vote and won 
unanimous support last week at its first Senate committee stop, requires the 
California Public Utilities Commission to order PacBell to offer long-distance 
service within the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The realization that California doesn't have the authority to do this -- the 
Legislature's own lawyers pointed out that it would violate a federal court ban 
on regional Bell companies entering the long-distance markets -- sent lawmakers 
scrambling to rejigger the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Now it is predicated on action at the federal level, in effect making the 
Legislature a lobbyist on PacBell's behalf before Congress -- which is weighing 
several such measures -- or the federal courts. PacBell is the only company 
that would benefit from the bill. (PacBell serves about two-thirds of 
Californians. GTE, which serves most of the rest, wouldn't be affected.) 
</P>
<P>
 "Our point is, if Congress doesn't act and we need to go to (U.S. District 
Judge Harold Greene), we would like the support of the Legislature and the 
PUC," says Phil Quigley, chairman of Pacific Telesis, the parent of PacBell. 
</P>
<P>
 And just in case the amended bill is still illegal, PacBell promises to pay 
for the lawyers when the PUC gets sued. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrangement sounds a little cozy to some. "One wonders if the PUC isn't up 
for rent then," says Albert Chu, the PUC's former legislative liaison. Others 
wonder about the Legislature going to bat for one company over dozens of others 
and preempting the normal regulatory path. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Michael Noll, a professor and telecommunications expert at USC's Annenberg 
School for Communication, says that if the bill is enacted, it will mark a 
subversion of the regulatory process, foster a revival of the old Ma Bell 
monopoly and represent a sellout by the Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so arrogant," Noll says. "It sounds like PacBell is taking over the 
state of California." 
</P>
<P>
 That is, of course, hyperbole. PacBell is maneuvering for advantage against 
the time when, under deregulatory policies being pursued nationwide, it is 
expected to lose its virtual monopoly on local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, though the claim is ridiculed by many, Quigley argues that PacBell 
already faces significant local competition in urban areas, where a handful of 
firms offer private lines to big corporations. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless it is freed to move quickly into long-distance markets, PacBell 
contends, it could be overrun by the established long-distance providers and 
left with little but the market nobody else wants: unprofitable residential 
local phone service. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fight between major interests, each one seeking advantage," says 
Daniel Fessler, a former University of California, Davis, law professor who now 
chairs the PUC. He calls the bill unnecessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The phone conversations have gotten downright nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 If it's allowed to compete, PacBell says, it will undercut long-distance rates 
by 20% -- a promise opponents say it couldn't keep without abusing its monopoly 
power. Both sides have commissioned "studies" concluding that the other guys 
are obscenely profitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Quigley likes to call AT&T a "genteel oligopoly." USC's Noll says that "a 
monopoly calling someone else an oligopoly is like the Mafia calling the CIA 
evil." 
</P>
<P>
 In making its case, PacBell has wrapped itself snugly in the California state 
flag. Pacific Bell is in fact the state's largest employer, and a political and 
civic force in virtually every community in California, and dozens of local 
groups from across the state are backing the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're the home team," says PacBell lobbyist Ron del Principe. 
</P>
<P>
 "But so are we!" cries Sam Medina of Napa, co-founder of NVTS Ameritel, one of 
115 small, little-known long-distance companies operating in California, 
including 52 based in the state. Nearly all their customers are businesses, and 
their rates are typically 15% below those of AT&T, MCI and Sprint. 
</P>
<P>
 Medina's complaint is the same as that of the bigger long-distance outfits: 
Because their customers all must go through PacBell's switches to get access to 
their long-distance lines, letting PacBell compete for those calls would enable 
it to undermine its competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 Says AT&T lobbyist Douglas Kindrick: "It's hard to carry on a war with someone 
you buy your bullets from." 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone agrees that more competition is coming to the telephone business, but 
meanwhile Pacific Bell retains a virtual monopoly over purely local phone 
service as well as "local long-distance" -- toll calls within each of the 10 
telephone regions in the state. PacBell is expected to lose that intra-regional 
monopoly later this year by order of the PUC. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle in the Legislature is over a third market -- the $3-billion-plus 
market for phone calls between those 10 phone regions, such as from Los Angeles 
to San Francisco. Those calls, like national and international calls, are 
handled by long-distance carriers -- chiefly AT&T, MCI and Sprint. PacBell and 
the other Baby Bells are barred from those markets under the 1984 consent 
decree setting rules for competition in the wake of Ma Bell. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, the consent decree signed by Judge Greene allows a waiver 
from this inter-regional long-distance ban if the Baby Bells can show it is 
unlikely they could use their market power to impede competition in the new 
market. PacBell has been free to seek this waiver on its own for a decade, but 
hasn't tried. 
</P>
<P>
 "They understand it would be difficult to convince federal authorities that 
they meet this test," says Ray Marshall, a UC-Berkeley economist and former 
labor secretary under President Jimmy Carter, testifying for AT&T. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Congress is debating several measures that would supersede Greene's 
court order, letting the Baby Bells enter long-distance markets under certain 
conditions or letting each state decide. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be in Congress, rather than before Greene's court, where PacBell would 
have the best luck in invoking the name of the California Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Judge Greene is supposed to judge based on the prevailing conditions in each 
market, not on whether the Bell companies have more campaign money to give to 
legislators," says Bradley Stillman, legislative director of the Consumer 
Federation of America. 
</P>
<P>
 The CFA and the main phone utility watchdogs in the state, Toward Utility Rate 
Normalization and Consumer Action, oppose the legislation in part because it 
appears to usurp authority from the PUC -- a legislative strategy that USC's 
Noll says is increasingly being used by the Baby Bells. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill does leave a role for the PUC, ordering it to implement safeguards 
against PacBell abusing its monopoly power. But the utility resists what 
consumer groups and others want: a litmus test for the existence of local 
competition before PacBell is unleashed on the long-distance markets. PacBell's 
position has fueled suspicion of anti-competitive intentions. Among lawmakers, 
in any event, there has been little debate on such telecommunications issues. 
Instead, the focus has been on the need to protect California against 
"out-of-state companies." 
</P>
<P>
 The measure has been heavily pitched as a jobs bill. The influential Costa 
says it will "protect or create thousands of jobs" because big non-California 
companies such as AT&T have been shifting jobs out of the state and cutting 
back. PacBell, meanwhile, will have slashed its own work force by about a 
third, to 42,000, between 1990 and 1998. The Arguments 
</P>
<P>
 If Pacific Bell wins the right to offer long-distance calls within California, 
it promises to slash phone rates. It's no surprise that AT&T, MCI and Sprint 
oppose PacBell's entry into the market. But consumer groups and many 
telecommunications experts also oppose it. At issue is whether a 
PacBell-sponsored measure sailing through the California Legislature would 
position the utility to turn its local phone monopoly into a statewide one and 
force rates higher. Here are claims and counterclaims on the effect of the 
bill, AB 3720. 
</P>
<P>
 For: 
</P>
<P>
 * PacBell will undercut the competition on long-distance rates inside 
California by 20%. 
</P>
<P>
 * Thousands of California jobs will be "protected and created" because the 
state's largest private employer will be freed to compete in the 
$3-billion-plus market for long-distance calls between the state's 10 phone 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bill will promote competition, innovation and new technology by 
challenging the "genteel oligopoly" composed of AT&T, MCI and Sprint, which 
together control 90% of the long-distance market. 
</P>
<P>
 * It brings the law up to date in the fast-shifting world of 
telecommunications, where new technology makes the notion of a local-phone 
monopoly a myth. 
</P>
<P>
 Against: 
</P>
<P>
 * Rates will fall temporarily until PacBell achieves dominance, then rise 
about 9%. 
</P>
<P>
 * There will be a job shift to PacBell from dozens of small, independent, 
non-union long-distance companies based in California, with a net loss of 
38,000 jobs in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 * The bill will stifle competition by enabling Pacific Bell to use its control 
of local phone switches, customer lists and other monopoly advantages to 
compete unfairly in the long-distance markets. 
</P>
<P>
 * PacBell remains a monopoly as the only carrier in its service areas that is 
allowed to offer a dial tone, making it the "toll booth" through which all 
customers must pass to get access to other companies' long-distance services.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: INS AND OUTS OF DUAL-CLASS STOCK 
ARRANGEMENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A recently announced plan by Times Mirror Co. to spin off its cable television 
operations has raised questions about corporations' use of dual classes of 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Times Mirror, parent of the Los Angeles Times, is facing several lawsuits from 
shareholders who contend that the plan unfairly favors the company's 
controlling Chandler family. Under the plan, the Chandlers will get a new issue 
of dividend-paying preferred stock, while common shareholders will get shares 
in a new cable venture. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not the first time a company with dual classes of stock has been sued 
over what some shareholders consider to be unequal treatment. Dual classes of 
stock -- which give some shareholders more say in how a company is operated -- 
have been a contentious issue since they became more common during the 
mid-1980s, says Patrick McGurn, legal counsel for the Investor Responsibility 
Research Center in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 What are dual-class stock arrangements and what are regulators' plans for 
them? Here are some answers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What is a dual-class stock arrangement? 
</P>
<P>
 A. typical dual-class arrangement stipulates that a company has a Class A 
share and a Class B share.  
</P>
<P>
 Those who hold B shares may have greater voting rights than those who hold A 
shares. However, the A shareholders may get a bigger dividend. 
</P>
<P>
 Normally, ordinary investors can buy only one type of share -- in this case, 
the A shares. That's because the "super-voting" B shares are generally owned by 
a controlling group, such as the founding family or a management group. 
</P>
<P>
 Dual classes gained popularity in the mid-1980s, when hostile takeovers and 
leveraged buyouts became the rage. The idea was to give a friendly group of 
stockholders voting control -- even if they didn't own more than 50% of the 
stock -- to thwart unfriendly buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Who has dual classes of stock? 
</P>
<P>
 A. survey by the Investor Responsibility Research Center in Washington of the 
nation's 1,500 largest public companies found that 122 had dual-stock classes 
as of the end of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies with dual classes include Dow Jones & Co., Washington Post Co., 
Citicorp, Dillard Department Stores, E.W. Scripps Co., Home Shopping Network, 
Adolph Coors Co., Readers Digest Assn., Rockwell International and Tyson Foods, 
according to the center. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Times Mirror and several others, the shareholders obtaining 
super-voting stock were founding family members who already had significant 
voting power before the new class of shares was created. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Are dual classes necessarily bad? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Corporate managers argue that these arrangements ensure that stockholders 
get a fair shake in a hostile takeover. For example, some managers contend that 
their companies became targets when an unusual event depressed the price of the 
stock. Raiders then swooped in and made offers that, in normal circumstances, 
would seem anemic. 
</P>
<P>
 However, some shareholders balk at two-tiered stock deals because they reduce 
individual stockholders' ability to influence corporate decisions. 
Additionally, super-voting shares tend to command premium prices, while other 
shares tend to sell at a discount, says Nell Minow, principal of Lens Inc., a 
Washington-based investment group. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How much does it cost investors to have the lesser-voting shares? 
</P>
<P>
 A. It depends on the company and the voting power of the super-voting shares. 
A dramatic example of how vast the disparity can be involved Donald Trump's 
purchase of Resorts International. Trump paid $135 for the company's 
controlling Class B shares, which commanded 100 votes each, and later bid just 
$15 each for the single-vote Class A shares. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually, the per-share price discrepancies are not as wide, partly because the 
voting power is not that dramatically different. Super-voting shares usually 
enjoy between two and 10 times the voting power of an average common share. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are regulators doing about dual classes of stock? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Late last year, the Securities and Exchange Commission urged stock 
exchanges to adopt rules limiting the rights of companies to create dual 
classes. The exchanges are complying with the request.  
</P>
<P>
 While the new rules are not final, they are expected to largely follow 
so-called 19(c)4 regulations in effect before 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 In brief, these rules barred companies from exchanging shares with equal 
voting rights for shares with unequal voting rights. The idea is simply that 
shareholders should not be "disenfranchised." 
</P>
<P>
 Companies that already have dual classes of stock -- such as Times Mirror -- 
would be grandfathered, allowing them to maintain the current arrangement. Nor 
would start-ups and companies that offer dual classes in an initial public 
offering be hindered, because shareholders buy in knowing their limited voting 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
 But companies that attempt to reduce the voting rights of certain shareholders 
after the fact, by issuing new super-voting stock, would have their shares 
banned from trading on major stock exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. When would those rules go into effect? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Probably not until late this year or early next year, if at all. That's 
because each of the nation's major stock exchanges must submit its own rule 
changes based on the SEC request. And the commission wants uniform rules for 
everyone -- a daunting task. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC would put the proposed rules out for public comment, then review the 
comments and make a final determination about whether the exchange rule changes 
are acceptable. In ideal circumstances, the process takes six months to a year.

MONEY TALK / CARLA LAZZARESCHI: STUDYING WAYS TO SAVE FOR COLLEGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLA LAZZARESCHI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Q. We are in our early 30s and have an infant son. We want to start a college 
fund for him with $1,500 we have saved. What is the best way to proceed? We 
hope to be able to add to the fund periodically. -- C.L. 
</P>
<P>
 A. Your most conservative choice would be to purchase U.S. Savings Bonds under 
the College Saver plan. They are absolutely safe, require no commission fees 
and can be regularly purchased in small denominations. Further, as you may 
know, middle- and lower-income taxpayers who use Savings Bonds for their 
children's college education don't have to pay federal income tax on the bond 
proceeds. (Savings Bonds have traditionally been exempt from state taxes as 
well.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone, however, qualifies for the plan. Eligibility depends on the 
income of the family at the time the bonds are redeemed. Currently, taxpayers 
filing individual returns are entitled to a full federal tax break on the bond 
proceeds if their adjusted gross income is less than about $45,000. The tax 
break is gradually phased out as the individual's income approaches a maximum 
of about $60,000. Couples filing joint returns must have an adjusted gross 
income of less than about $67,000 to take full advantage of the federal tax 
break. Partial tax breaks are available for couples with adjusted gross incomes 
up to a maximum of about $97,000. These income limits are adjusted annually by 
a cost-of-living index and will certainly be higher by the time your son is 
ready to enter college. 
</P>
<P>
 A more aggressive choice is offered by Margi Mullen, a Los Angeles financial 
planner and portfolio manager, who recommends investing in a mutual fund 
specifically aimed at long-term growth. She suggests investigating 20th Century 
Giftrust Investors, a highly rated fund used by many college savers. You can 
open an account with as little as $250 and periodically add to it at will. 
However, the fund must be purchased as a gift trust and must be held for either 
10 years or until the child reaches adulthood. The fund, which invests in 
stocks and whose value can fluctuate dramatically over short periods, has 
enjoyed strong growth in recent years. It does not charge an initial 
commission, but it does levy a management fee of 1% a year. For more 
information, call (800) 345-2021. Intrigued by Streisand's Coastal Estate 
Donation 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I am intrigued with Barbra Streisand's plan to donate her coastal estate to 
the state and am wondering if such an offer can be advantageous to mere mortal 
taxpayers stuck with a house they can't sell or are in danger of losing to 
foreclosure. What kind of a write-off can you get by donating your house to a 
charity? -- M.P . 
</P>
<P>
 A. First of all, for a contribution to be deductible, it must be made to a 
registered charity. Further, any charitable deduction of goods worth more than 
$5,000 must be verified by a signed independent appraisal that is submitted 
with your tax return. 
</P>
<P>
 Now then, how would such a gift work? It depends, of course, on the donor's 
tax bracket and whether the property is owned free and clear or is subject to a 
mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 If the property is unencumbered by mortgage, the computation is simple. The 
net effect of the deduction is determined only by the donor's tax bracket. A 
donation of a $10,000 property from a donor in the 38% combined tax bracket 
(31% federal and 7% state) yields $3,800 in tax relief. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if the property carries a mortgage, the amount of the donated 
mortgage is considered a cash payment to the donor and substantially reduces -- 
or even eliminates -- the deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's say the $10,000 property carries a $5,000 mortgage and a $5,000 tax 
basis. (The tax basis is the baseline number used to calculate a capital gain.) 
The donor, explains Palm Springs accountant Howard Gordon, would net a 
deduction of only $2,500. To a donor in the combined 38% tax bracket, the net 
effect of the write-off is $950 in tax relief. Deducting Computer Costs: Is It 
Worth It? 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I work for a software development company. I bought a home computer that I 
use a lot for work-related business. May I deduct some of the cost of the 
computer, its accessories and supplies? -- C.K . 
</P>
<P>
 A. You can, but once you understand the IRS' strict ground rules and severe 
limitations, you may decide it's not worth the effort. To be eligible for a 
deduction, your home computer must be used more than half the time for 
business-related activities. Let's say you use the computer, its accessories 
and all supplies 60% of the time for business-related work. You would then be 
eligible to deduct up to 60% of your charges -- subject to constraints.  
</P>
<P>
 For starters, your equipment must be amortized over five years. This means you 
would first divide the cost of your computer, printer and other devices by 
five, then multiply that number by 0.6. (Supplies do not have to be amortized, 
but you may deduct only 60% of these costs in any given year.) After you have 
made these computations, you are entitled to deduct only that amount that 
exceeds 2% of your adjusted gross income. Do you still have a deduction? 
</P>
<P>
 Say your computer equipment cost $5,000, an amount that should get you a 
pretty nifty home office setup. By our reckoning, you could allocate $600 of 
that amount to business-related activities per year for five years. Let's say 
you spend $200 a year on supplies, giving you a $120 annual charge for 
business-related supplies. Your total potential deduction is $720. Now let's 
say you have an adjusted gross income of $70,000, 2% of which equals $1,400. 
The bottom line: You don't have a deduction. Not even close. 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson here is that unless your income is quite low or your computer 
equipment is very expensive, you are not likely to have a legal deduction. 
Further, even if you do have a deduction, you may decide it's not worth taking, 
because they are known to raise a red flag to the IRS.

HOME BUYERS' NO. 1 PRIORITY IS NEIGHBORHOOD SAFE FROM CRIME; HOUSING: KITCHEN 
LAYOUT IS A DISTANT SECOND IN CALIFORNIA SURVEY CONDUCTED BY IRVINE FIRM. THE 
STUDY TRACKS 3,000 SERIOUS SHOPPERS IN REAL ESTATE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When looking for a new home, prospective buyers in California consider 
neighborhood security their No. 1 concern, even before home design, lot size, 
schools and a builder's reputation, according to a survey released Friday 
during a home building conference here. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 92% of buyers said neighborhood crime and security had the 
largest impact on their decision on whether to purchase a home; design and 
layout of the kitchen had the second-largest impact at 74%, according to the 
survey by National Survey Systems, an Irvine survey company that compiled the 
data. 
</P>
<P>
 "Neighborhood security isn't the first thing that you think of, but it's not 
surprising. It's a big issue, " said Jeff Meyers, principal with the Meyers 
Group, a Newport Beach real estate consulting firm that participated in the 
survey. "These days neighborhood and community is first. Once you sell them on 
a community, then you start looking at homes." 
</P>
<P>
 Released during the Pacific Coast Builders Conference, the survey tracked 
opinions of nearly 3,000 serious home shoppers interviewed at 54 Southern 
California housing developments and 39 in Northern California during April and 
May. The respondents said that they planned to purchase a home within the next 
six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Titled "Vision 94, The California New Home Buyer Preference Survey," the 
survey found that 30% of shoppers planned to be in their homes longer than 15 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The biggest surprise to us was the length of time people expected to be in 
their homes," said Robert Mirman, president of National Survey Systems. "This 
means they are looking for a different kind of commitment from their builder. 
They are looking for quality and a flexible design that can change as they 
raise their families.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Home is a different entity today than it was in the 1980s. Today it is a 
retreat, a comfort zone. It is not just an investment." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the discussion about the survey results focused on the increased role 
technology plays in the lives of home shoppers, and how that affects home 
design. 
</P>
<P>
 The survey found that 73% of shoppers own or plan to soon buy a home computer, 
an increase from the 66% of shoppers with a similar response last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "The merging of the television and the home computer, and how that system is 
set up in the home, will be a real consideration for builders in the future," 
Meyers said. "Builders will have to look and see how that fits into the 
design." 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 32% of shoppers wanted a home with an office, and about 37% said 
someone in their family worked at home at least occasionally. The percentage of 
shoppers who said they would use an extra bedroom as an office was 32%, a five 
percentage point increase from last year, when only 27% said they would. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, more of the potential buyers said they were optimistic about the 
economy, with nearly one-third predicting the state's economy would get better 
in the near future as compared to only 13% in last year's survey.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; VOICE OF CHANGE; UCI PROF. JOSEPH WHITE'S CAREER HAS BEEN A 
POTENT MIX OF ACADEMICS, SOCIAL ACTIVISM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD BONHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his townhouse a few miles from UC Irvine, Joseph White puts on a string 
quartet CD and begins to sift through mounds of material on a large, square 
coffee table. Classical music is his choice when studying or getting in the 
mood for his newfound practice of Zen meditation, but generally he turns to 
blues -- "the gut-bucket, git-down Mississippi blues, the old-time stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Somewhere on the coffee table amid the mass of paperbacks, manuscripts and 
journals is a 1958 snapshot of Malcolm X, an acquaintance, White says, "before 
he went nationwide as the Malcolm X." 
</P>
<P>
 Books are everywhere -- on the couch, on tables, covering the four walls of 
his study. Near the front door, under the stairs, are yet more piles: cards and 
gifts from the recent party that celebrated White's decades of teaching at UCI. 
</P>
<P>
 White's countenance -- he is of average build, not tall, thinnish hair tending 
to gray, with alert eyes behind glasses -- speaks of patience and geniality. 
His laugh is irresistible -- a tonsil-rattling mix of a croak and a 
snee-snee-snee. He chuckles as he locates the photo, recalling that although he 
and his cohorts at Michigan State University considered themselves progressive 
reformists, "Malcolm told us we were Uncle Toms in training. He used to come in 
and practice his speeches in my class." 
</P>
<P>
 Next week White, 61, retires from UCI as professor of psychology and 
comparative culture. During a career that was a potent blend of scholarship and 
social activism, he crossed paths with Robert F. Kennedy, Eldridge Cleaver and 
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. He also rocked the psychology establishment on 
two fronts. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with a handful of other black psychologists, White in 1968 made public 
demands that more blacks be brought into the discipline. He also charged that 
traditional psychological theories were bankrupt when used to study black 
Americans, who have a unique ethos. His theories laid the groundwork for the 
growth of multicultural studies on campuses nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past two decades, however, it has been Joe White the educator who has 
impressed his students. 
</P>
<P>
 The grandson of a traveling Baptist evangelist, White inherited a lecture 
style that's "better than theater," according to one former student, who added 
that "even in three-hour classes, which can be sleepers, students would arrive 
15 minutes early, so as not to miss anything." 
</P>
<P>
 White's diction is marked by smooth, regular downshifts into the vernacular to 
add emphasis; "Keep the faith" is his signature sign-off to classes. 
</P>
<P>
 To his students, White's top value was as a mentor -- a volunteer faculty 
counselor, confidant and guide. Dozens of black, white, Asian and Latino former 
students were among the 250 friends and colleagues at his surprise retirement 
party May 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe is probably one of the most dynamic and charismatic professors I've ever 
encountered. He was an incredible mentor," said Carly Flam, a former student 
who credits White with persuading her to get her master's degree in counseling 
at Harvard. "He sparked my interest by bringing his experiences as an African 
American male to his teaching." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Halford H. Fairchild, editor of the journal Psych Discourse: "I consider 
him my personal mentor, even though I never attended an institution where he 
taught. His reach is very broad. I call him mzee , which means 'respected 
elder' " in Swahili. 
</P>
<P>
 White's directorships, honors and fellowships fill eight resume pages. He 
played founding roles in Head Start, the Educational Opportunity Program and 
various anti-drug and anti-gang programs. A psychology teacher and practicing 
clinician for all of his 32-year career, he is an affiliate staff psychologist 
specializing in adolescent behavior at five Southern California hospitals. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning in 1969, White taught psychology and directed the black culture 
program at Irvine. He became director of the African-American Studies program 
in 1991, an academic minor that currently has about 20 students. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking at the field of psychology as it relates to African Americans, the 
title of 'father of black psychology' would have to go to Joe White. He brought 
the study of black psychology to the forefront," said Robert Guthrie, author of 
"Even the Rat Was White," a history of race relations in American science. (The 
late Charles Thomas of UC San Diego shares the title after serving as the first 
president of the Assn. of Black Psychologists.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The genius of Joe White was not just that he was champion for the (black 
psychology) movement but that he inspired so many students to be critical 
thinkers," said Thomas A. Parham, a former student of White's and now a 
professor of social science and director of UCI's counseling center. "He was 
the first to call into question the Eurocentric paradigm for defining the lives 
of Afro-American people." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 From childhood, White was taught the importance of self-esteem. His 
strong-willed mother, Dorothy, had graduated at the top of her high school 
class and worked two jobs to support him and his siblings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The role models of my extended family also came into play," White said. "I 
had an uncle who attended the University of Nebraska in the '30s, and another 
uncle was the only black in California to pass the bar in 1952." 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Lincoln, Neb., in 1932, White at age 2 moved with his mother to 
Minneapolis after his parents separated. He was just 8 when he got a job at the 
downtown Curtis Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 "The maitre d' took a liking to me and gave me work polishing silver and 
running errands. It was work that I now realize really didn't need to be done," 
he said. "They let me work as a waiter when I was a teen-ager, and I made 
pretty good money and met all the important people in the Twin Cities." 
</P>
<P>
 About that time, White's older brother dropped out of high school. "My mother 
saw what was coming for me, so she yanked me out of that track and got me 
accepted at the Christian Brothers Catholic school across town. I was one of 
two blacks out of 800 students. She talked the brother superior into paying my 
tuition." 
</P>
<P>
 Unbeknown to White, the school's curriculum was college-prep, so after 
graduation he had fulfilled all the requirements for admission to the UC and 
Cal State systems. After working his way West as a waiter in the club car of a 
passenger train, he enrolled at San Francisco State College in 1950. 
</P>
<P>
 White earned bachelor's and master's degrees in psychology, served a term in 
the Army and then looked for work, but without success. Frustrated, he turned 
to sympathetic counselors at San Francisco State, who told him that a Ph.D. was 
the only sure way for a black to get a good job. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem, White realized, would be to find a graduate school in psychology 
that would accept a black. Rather than go through the laborious process and 
expense of formally applying to colleges, White wrote brief letters to several 
programs. He asked whether there were openings for a student who had graduated 
with honors and who also happened to be black. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most schools sent me nasty replies, but worded diplomatically, saying things 
like, 'Psychology is only for brilliant people. Maybe you should think about 
being a recreation director or social worker,' " White recalls. "But Michigan 
State accepted me, and so did (the University of) Colorado." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It was after he earned his degree from Michigan State in 1962 that one of his 
career paths started to emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 When he arrived in Long Beach to begin his practice as one of only five black 
Americans in the nation with doctorates in clinical psychology, White became 
embarrassed and exasperated as landlords systematically refused him housing and 
office space. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though I spent almost 18 months in the South as a soldier, I didn't know 
how deep racism was in America till I got that Ph.D.," White said, adding that 
the experience was particularly galling because "I had been trained all my life 
to believe in the performance aspect. I thought if you had enough (academic) 
tickets, that was all you had to do." 
</P>
<P>
 In the years leading to his degree, White now realizes, the institutions of 
school and the military had shielded him from overt discrimination. 
</P>
<P>
 Recalling the letter-writing campaign that helped him start his doctoral 
program, White used a similar tactic to find adequate housing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ran a classified ad in the Long Beach paper, saying, 'Black couple with 
three small children seek large apartment.' We got a few threatening phone 
calls. But then a guy called, and here's what he did: We drove around till we 
found a house we both liked. Then he bought it and leased it to us. We were the 
only black family in the Lakewood area at that time. I made a public statement, 
and somebody came through." 
</P>
<P>
 While a faculty member at Cal State Long Beach from 1962 to '68, White was 
frustrated by its low black enrollment. "Here we were, right on the edge of 
South-Central L.A., and out of 15,000 students we only had 65 blacks," White 
recalls. "It didn't make any sense." 
</P>
<P>
 His solution: Use the special admissions option, normally used by the college 
to recruit top athletes who lacked academic standing, to enroll 68 blacks and 
Latinos. Eventually, with the legislative help of White's friend, Assemblyman 
Willie Brown (D-San Francisco), the Educational Opportunity Program was 
expanded statewide, and White traveled to all 19 state college campuses in 
1968. 
</P>
<P>
 During those years he was active in local housing issues with the Democratic 
Party in Long Beach, and in the spring of 1968 served as Long Beach campaign 
director for his "main man," Robert F. Kennedy, in the presidential primary. 
</P>
<P>
 A few months after Kennedy was assassinated, the political turmoil continued 
for White when he found himself in the middle of the student strike at San 
Francisco State. 
</P>
<P>
 "It shut down the campus for 4 1/2 months. I was dean of undergraduate 
studies, and as the highest-ranking black, I was recruited into it and became a 
spokesman," he said. "I had known the president of the university when I was an 
undergraduate, so I had a line to both him and the students." 
</P>
<P>
 Eldridge Cleaver and other members of the Black Panthers, who lived in the 
same neighborhood as many of the striking students, made speeches and lent 
support during the strike, White said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The black students struck, and some white students and faculty struck with 
them. The kids wanted a full black studies department as an approved major. The 
protest to establish the legitimacy of black studies was solid; I endorsed that 
all the way. They were successful, and from there on came the ethnic studies at 
all campuses. But there came a point in time when the strike became an entity 
of its own rather than a means to an end." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The late 1960s were years of crisis for White in other ways. In August, 1968, 
as the American Psychological Assn. was convening in San Francisco, he and 57 
other black delegates were demanding reform within the organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1984 book "The Psychology of Blacks," White described the source of 
their frustration: 
</P>
<P>
 "Graduate schools in psychology were still turning out a combined national 
total of only three or four Black Ph.D.'s in psychology a year. . . . The grand 
total of (blacks) among the more than 10,000 members of the American 
Psychological Assn., psychology's most prestigious organization, was less than 
1%."  
</P>
<P>
 On the convention's third day, White and four other black psychologists held a 
rancorous meeting with the executive council. They demanded that more blacks be 
admitted to doctoral programs and wanted the association to make a statement in 
opposition to prevailing conclusions in psychology texts that blacks were an 
inferior race. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a real intense meeting," White recalled. "Some whites were called 
racist, and some on the council had been our own teachers. So it was almost a 
generational battle. Their notion was, why were we rejecting all they had 
taught us? 
</P>
<P>
 "What evolved from this was the APA forming a division of minority affairs, 
and we formed the Assn. of Black Psychologists. But we think there's a lot left 
to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 In district court a few years later, White and other black psychologists 
successfully challenged the legality of IQ tests that they said had caused a 
disproportionate percentage of black students to be labeled mentally retarded 
(in California in 1972, according to White, blacks comprised 9% of the student 
population but 25% of its retarded cases). 
</P>
<P>
 In White's ground-breaking article, "Toward a Black Psychology," published in 
Ebony magazine in 1970, he wrote that traditional psychology theories, which 
had been developed by white psychologists to explain white people, were 
inadequate to understand black lifestyles and unfairly led to blacks being 
defined as deviant or intellectually inferior to whites. 
</P>
<P>
 White disputed, for example, the widely held notion that black families are 
matriarchal. Rather, White wrote, the uncles, aunts, boyfriends, clergy and 
older siblings who participate in rearing a black child constitute a type of 
extended family. As such, they also prevent the child from developing rigid 
distinctions of male and female roles. 
</P>
<P>
 Other characteristics distinguishing blacks from whites were also ignored and 
thus contributed to skewed analyses, he says. These include an emphasis on 
collective, rather than individual, survival; respect for elders; an oral 
tradition; a spiritual nature, and a fluid, as opposed to a linear, perception 
of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a quarter-century later, black psychology is "a little beyond tolerance 
but not into total acceptability," White says. "The strongest area of 
acceptability is in the practitioners. They require multiethnic psychology in 
the training. Without it, I don't know how they could do marriage and family 
counseling or child development in California, which is 49% ethnic minority." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for the APA said the availability of strong minority candidates 
for graduate schools remains low. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're looking for a doctoral candidate and you want to pick from a pool, 
it's not as diverse as it could be," said Rhea Farberman, the spokeswoman. "We 
have internships and grant programs for ethnic minorities to increase the 
diversity in the candidate pool." 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of ethnic minority members in the 76,000-member APA has risen 
to 5%, says Bertha Holliday, director of the Office of Ethnic Minority Affairs. 
More than 20% of these minority members are from California, a fact that 
Holliday credits to White's efforts in bringing blacks into the field. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For now, White says he'll be using at least the first year of his retirement 
"to get my head straight" and take stock of his career. He wants to spend more 
time with his wife, Lois, an elementary school teacher, and keep in closer 
touch with daughters Lori, 36, a doctoral student at Stanford, Lynn, 34, a 
singer and paralegal in Los Angeles, and Lisa, 32, an assistant professor of 
geology at White's alma mater in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 He'll also continue working on a book exploring the social psychology of black 
males, and another book on adult life transitions. 
</P>
<P>
 For 1995, White is considering a tempting offer: an endowed chair in 
psychology at the University of Nebraska. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the offer's appeal, White admits, is that it will bring him 
full-circle in a lifetime spent fighting racism. 
</P>
<P>
 For he would be returning in triumph not only to the city of his birth, but 
also to the very university where, during the Depression, his mother scrubbed 
floors at fraternity houses and his father, Joseph Sr., shined shoes at King's 
Barber Shop three blocks away.

THE SUNDAY PROFILE; AN INVENTED LIFE; FUELED BY THE DESIRE TO BE EVERYTHING HIS 
FAMILY WAS NOT, WARREN BENNIS CREATED A WORLD FULL OF POWER AND PRESTIGE. BUT 
NOW THE BUSINESS GURU IS WRESTLING WITH THOUGHTS OF FUN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROY RIVENBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has dated Ann Landers, been quoted by Al Gore and received faxes from the 
Dalai Lama. 
</P>
<P>
 At 69, Warren Bennis is in the thick of what he calls "an invented life." He 
is guru to a generation of business leaders, owner of a perpetual suntan (which 
he somehow maintained even while living in Buffalo, N.Y.), and new husband to a 
woman he dumped at the altar some 30 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent months, he also has been touched by the shadow of a revived 
controversy over 1960s human radiation experiments, but that issue seems far 
from his mind on this day. 
</P>
<P>
 Sinking into the seat of a limousine streaking across the desert, he slips off 
his shoes and talks about heart attacks, twin brothers and the importance of 
learning to sing. It's a Friday afternoon and Bennis is running behind for a 
speech in a hotel near Palm Springs, the latest in a hectic series of 
appearances that reportedly earn him up to $20,000 a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversation, like the speech, is a stream of offbeat anecdotes, quotes 
and light humor. And the theme of each is leadership and change. Bennis -- a 
USC business professor who has metamorphosed from wanna-be rabbi to soldier to 
college president to author to one of the hottest guns on the corporate 
consulting and lecture circuit -- says he is addicted to new experiences and 
ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 The fascination started at alma mater Antioch College -- a university that was 
politically correct decades before the term was invented. (When Bennis arrived 
in 1947, students there were ordering organically grown wheat from a special 
locale in Texas and joining the Young Communist League because fraternities 
were verboten .)  
</P>
<P>
 Bennis, fresh out of the Army after a lonely childhood in the Bronx and New 
Jersey, dove into the maelstrom of ideas and emerged a pipe-smoking, tweedy 
clone of Antioch President Doug McGregor: "I . . . tried to be like him in 
every conceivable way," Bennis writes in a 1993 collection of essays.  
</P>
<P>
 At MIT, where he earned a doctorate in economics and social sciences, the 
self-described "Milli Vanilli" syndrome continued, with Bennis lip-syncing the 
words of so many professors that "when I began teaching undergraduates, I 
didn't always know who I'd be that day or what I would sound like. On some 
days, I thought of myself as a total fraud." 
</P>
<P>
 It was also while teaching management at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology that he met Grace Gabe, now his third wife but then a third-year 
medical student who used to follow him home in her little green MG. 
</P>
<P>
 "We loved Japanese movies of the time," she wrote in a recent Psychology Today 
article on rekindling old flames. "After a film, Warren would race up and grab 
me with a samurai leap and a hiss (and) I would fold up with laughter. We 
danced around his apartment. We rushed out to buy the latest albums. And we 
decided to live together at a time when it wasn't done." 
</P>
<P>
 But several years later, three days before their scheduled wedding, Bennis 
ended the relationship with a 100-word telegram -- and Gabe didn't see him for 
another 30 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennis says he got cold feet. Gabe, now a psychiatrist, offers a different 
theory: "Warren was always a very ambitious man . . . and I can't count the 
hours we spent discussing the strategies of his getting ahead in the academic 
community. . . . He wanted a wife devoted to helping him . . . (but I had my 
own career and) was not available on a daily basis to back him up in the social 
arena of Cambridge academic competition." 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve months afterward, he married someone else -- who came from a wealthy 
Cleveland family and didn't work. Gabe also eventually married. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't until 1990 -- one heart attack, two marriages and 20 books later -- 
that Bennis reconsidered his decision. He looked up Gabe, by then divorced, 
during a trip to Washington and -- after she overcame her wariness and they 
slowly worked through the old hurts -- a wedding was set for November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she had a moment of anxiety on the morning of the ceremony," he says, 
"when I went out for a run." 
</P>
<P>
 Three days after the hotel appearance, Warren Bennis is in a seaside 
conference room in San Diego, perched in front of a huge projected image of 
planet Earth, telling 250 executives about a Tibetan monk and modern 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 "A few years ago," he intones, "I invited the Dalai Lama to participate in a 
seminar for (leaders) at USC . . . (and in response,) the embodiment of 
thousands of years of Tibetan spiritualism graciously declined -- by fax." 
</P>
<P>
 The lesson? The world is undergoing rapid, seismic change and leaders need to 
adjust. "If you think you're going to be successful running your business in 
the next 10 years the way you did the last 10 years, you're out of your mind," 
he says, quoting Coca-Cola CEO Roberto Goizueta. But not many companies seem to 
be getting the message. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennis ticks off a list: IBM. General Motors. Even organized crime. According 
to the New York Times, he says, Mafia coffers are shrinking because mob bosses 
have been "too content with what they had to think globally."  
</P>
<P>
 Bennis deadpans: "I expect any day now I'll get an invitation to speak on a 
(management) panel (to them too). And I can assure you I'll do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The talk continues with a compendium of maxims ("The manager has his eye on 
the bottom line; the leader has his eye on the horizon"), one-liners ("Trying 
to lead college faculty is like herding cats") and, of course, Bennis' 
prescription for management success in the late 20th Century: Dump the 
autocratic, "command-and-control" techniques of the past in favor of a 
workplace that encourages employee self-esteem, creativity, dissent, 
empowerment and teamwork. 
</P>
<P>
 The result of this switch from "macho to maestro," he promises, will be more 
and better ideas from employees, jumps in productivity and a stronger 
competitive edge. Executives must do less managing and more leading, he adds. 
They must possess a balance of vision, optimism, expertise, ambition and 
personal integrity: "The manager does things right; the leader does the right 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 The principles are distilled from his extensive interviews with such leaders 
as Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, basketball coach Pat Riley, General Electric boss 
John F. Welch Jr. and a Philadelphia zookeeper who used to be a government 
administrator. ("He told me there was virtually no difference between the two 
jobs," Bennis quips.) 
</P>
<P>
 For these and other nuggets of wisdom, the executives at the Clemson 
University-sponsored conference have paid about $350 apiece -- and many seem 
absorbed by the presentation. "I wish I could follow him around for about half 
a year," says a Texas Instruments official familiar with Bennis' work. 
</P>
<P>
 If that were to happen, however, the official might learn that Bennis' myriad 
articles, books and speeches are frequently identical -- "I don't know how many 
truths there are," he explains -- and even his conversations can sound canned. 
Several seemingly spontaneous anecdotes and answers to a reporter's questions, 
for example, turn out to be lifted from his lectures. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, much of Bennis' current management philosophy is the same as what he 
advocated during the 1960s, only then it was considered too radical and now 
it's widely accepted. "I was prematurely right," he declares. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's paying off. 
</P>
<P>
 Publishers are reissuing his books and essays. Business Week describes him as 
fascinating and provocative. And Vice President Gore says Bennis' 1989 volume 
"On Becoming a Leader" is must reading for his advisers. In May, Gore even had 
Bennis conduct a daylong seminar for his Washington staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Rival business guru John Kotter of Harvard says Bennis -- who also has 
consulted for the likes of Ford Motor Co., Polaroid and TRW -- is one of only a 
handful of speakers in the world who has conquered the senior-management group 
lecture market. "Aside from Tom Peters on occasion, the only other person I 
bump into is Warren," Kotter says. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Bennis isn't exactly a household name. His closest brush with that kind 
of fame, he says, came when People magazine photographed him dancing with 
advice columnist Ann Landers, whom he dated during the early 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
 White-haired, manicured and eternally poised, Bennis leads a somewhat Brahmin 
existence. He has a fondness for limos, lives on the shore in Santa Monica 
("Hang a left at the very end of the continent," he tells visitors) and wears 
casual denim work shirts with Armani tags on the pocket. 
</P>
<P>
 A Jaguar sits in his garage (when it's not in the shop) and an original 
Rauschenberg hangs by the front door of his starkly furnished split-level home. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a lifestyle driven by a "search for power and potency" that Bennis 
traces to early childhood. As he explains in an autobiographical essay 
published in his 1993 book "An Invented Life," he was fearful of his mother 
(who insisted he become a professional accordionist), unattached to his older 
twin brothers and disappointed in his father, a perennially unsuccessful 
entrepreneur who opened and closed a succession of candy stores, malt shops and 
soda stands.  
</P>
<P>
 Bennis recalls the day his father lost his last steady job as "one of the most 
wretched and despondent of my life. Without realizing it then, I vowed never 
again to feel such utter hopelessness." 
</P>
<P>
 In essence, he decided to become everything his family was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, the invented life began. He underwent six years of psychoanalysis during 
the 1950s, pored over Ralph Waldo Emerson and turned his own writing into 
"self-therapy" by choosing academic topics involving unresolved personal 
conflicts. He broke past his shyness by forcing himself into public-speaking 
roles. And he transformed his mind by devouring information. Bennis says he 
reads about 70 books a year (mostly history and nonfiction), skims another 400 
and looks at three newspapers a day. And he has hired a computer consultant to 
teach him electronic information-gathering. 
</P>
<P>
 He also claims to "talk to his soul" -- usually by looking for messages in his 
dreams -- but acknowledges that he "may be spiritually deficient." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly not an atheist," says Bennis, who grew up in a nominally Jewish 
household and briefly considered the idea of being a rabbi. "When I read some 
work or hear some music that is genius, such as Mahler's First Symphony, I 
think, my God, where does that come from. I attribute it to some greater being. 
. . . (But) I'm much more connected with the material world, much more 
Dionysian. I enjoy . . . the sun, good clothes, good food and good music." 
</P>
<P>
 And good tans. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of his three children once wrote in a grammar school essay, "My dad is 
kinda short for his age, but I've never seen him without a tan."  
</P>
<P>
 Even in Buffalo. After teaching at MIT, Boston University and Harvard (where 
he conducted social-science research with Timothy Leary in the latter's pre-LSD 
days), Bennis was hired as provost at the State University of New York at 
Buffalo in 1967.  
</P>
<P>
 His assignment was to help transform the school from "conventional university 
to . . . Berkeley of the East." But student unrest and a little girl derailed 
his dream. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, it was a heady time. Dressed in Tirolean cape and beret, Bennis 
revamped departments and hosted endless soirees. "Our house was constantly 
filled with academic superstars and promising newcomers," he writes in his 
autobiographical essay. 
</P>
<P>
 But his family life suffered. 
</P>
<P>
 Bennis and his wife held so many parties -- 65 in the first year alone -- that 
when he asked his 4-year-old daughter, Kate, what she wanted to be when she 
grew up, she answered: "A guest." 
</P>
<P>
 "I picked her up and laughed," Bennis writes. Then later, "when I was by 
myself, I cried. At 4, Kate was like the psychiatrist's child who wants to grow 
up to be a patient. . . . I learned a great deal at Buffalo, but one thing I 
did not learn was how to integrate intimacy with ambition." 
</P>
<P>
 The final blow came when the university president called in an army of police 
to quell a student uprising. Bennis, who objected to the decision, resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, he went to the University of Cincinnati, which presented problems 
of a different sort. Hired in 1971 as university president, Bennis soon found 
himself the victim of "a vast, amorphous, unwitting conspiracy to prevent me 
from doing anything whatever to change the university's status quo."  
</P>
<P>
 He writes: "This discovery caused me to formulate . . . Bennis' First Law of 
Academic Pseudodynamics, which states that routine work drives out non-routine 
work and smothers to death all creative planning, all fundamental change in . . 
. any institution." 
</P>
<P>
 He was besieged by -- among other things -- professors complaining about the 
temperature of classrooms, coaches grumbling about the school track and parents 
griping about four-letter words in an English class text. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also the radiation problem.  
</P>
<P>
 For 11 years before Bennis' arrival in September, 1971, at least 88 terminal 
cancer patients at the university's medical center -- most of them low-income 
blacks with a median IQ of 87 -- had been exposed to potentially lethal doses 
of whole-body radiation in a study sponsored by the military to gauge the 
effects of nuclear war. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after Bennis was hired, Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) began 
investigating the experiments, requesting interviews with the handful of 
patients who were still alive and threatening a Senate hearing.  
</P>
<P>
 Documents released earlier this year indicate that Bennis and other 
administrators -- with no privacy statute to block the release of patient names 
-- withheld the identities by arguing that interviews would harm the patients' 
health.  
</P>
<P>
 In fact, at least one of the survivors had already been questioned for a 
public-television show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was furious about (the names not being released)," Bennis says now. "I had 
been told it was for health reasons, then I discovered that some (of the 
patients) had been interviewed for a TV program. . . . I felt personally 
double-crossed by the (medical school officials)." 
</P>
<P>
 He says he doesn't remember why the names weren't released after that. 
Although conceding that he was ultimately accountable for the decision, he says 
that "other people (from the medical center) were calling the shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennis says he was "truly offended and saddened" by the experiments, but "my 
No. 1 thing was to stop a Senate hearing . . . because I thought it would be 
damaging for the university from a public-relations point of view and because 
we were trying to go (from being a city college to being) a state university. . 
. . I was a new president. . . . I got the best advice I could and took the 
best steps I could take."  
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1972, he canceled further radiation experiments -- and Kennedy 
called off the hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter wasn't reopened until a few months ago, when the U.S. Department of 
Energy vowed to "come clean" on various Cold War radiation experiments and 
local and national newspapers began investigating. Since then, Congress has 
held hearings, patient names have been uncovered and several class-action 
lawsuits have been filed by families of the victims. (Bennis isn't named in the 
suits.) 
</P>
<P>
 English professor Martha Stephens, who belonged to a junior faculty committee 
that criticized the experiments in 1972, says she still resents Bennis for what 
she considers a cover-up of the matter: "I don't say he did it single-handedly, 
but he was a major factor." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bennis' successor as university president, Henry R. Winkler, says Stephens 
and others are unfairly "trying to impose contemporary standards on how (Bennis 
acted). I think he tried to handle it responsibly and did." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennis, for his part, simply wishes the issue would go away: "I don't want to 
dwell too much on it, and I hope you don't dwell on it, either, because it 
happened 23 years ago. . . . It's not anything to do with Warren Bennis today." 
</P>
<P>
 But it did figure into his growing disenchantment with moving up the academic 
career ladder. And in 1978, he left the university. 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, he was divorced from his wife of 17 years, living on a houseboat 
in Sausalito and recovering from a heart attack. In the hospital, "I (became) 
acutely aware that something had come adrift inside," he writes in his essay. 
"Forcibly removed from the overbooked professional life I had created for 
myself, I began to write poetry for the first time ever." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, he came to USC as a sort of cameo professor in the business school. 
He does research, writes and occasionally spends a day or two teaching. After 
moving to L.A., he also married a television reporter he met in Cincinnati, but 
the relationship unraveled after three years.  
</P>
<P>
 He's now on sabbatical, but says he'll return to USC in the fall to raise 
money and hire staff for the Leadership Institute he founded at the school 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he's working on a new book -- a study of the creative synergy 
behind such groups as the Manhattan Project and the Clinton campaign -- and 
trying his hand at a one-act play. 
</P>
<P>
 Nibbling on a salad and sipping iced tea in his beachfront home on a recent 
Monday, Bennis says he is again aware of the tug between his professional and 
personal selves. 
</P>
<P>
 "This house (with its bleached wood floors and stark white walls) is so simple 
and uncluttered, whereas my life is very complicated and cluttered." 
</P>
<P>
 And part of him wants to uncomplicate. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, he says, he's retiring from the corporate lecture circuit. He wants 
more time for family -- son John, 28, is a Newport Beach stockbroker who comes 
up for tennis games with Dad; daughter Kate, now 30 and a struggling actress, 
visits from New York; and son Will, 26, checks in from Prague. 
</P>
<P>
 He wants more freedom for friends -- among them Norman Lear, Jonas Salk and 
93-year-old Sam Jaffe, a film producer who calls Bennis "the best friend I've 
ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 And he wants to warble. "I think music is fun, and it makes me feel good when 
I sing," he says. "I think it has something to do with endorphins. It gives me 
a high." 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, another part of Bennis argues against such pleasures. He 
quotes E.B. White: "I get up every morning determined both to change the world 
and have one hell of a good time. Sometimes, this makes planning the day 
difficult."  
</P>
<P>
 Adds Bennis: "I've never been able to both change the world and have a good 
time, so I have to make choices. Right now, I'm leaning toward the hell of a 
good time." Warren Bennis 
</P>
<P>
 Age: 69 
</P>
<P>
 Native: No. Raised on the East Coast, lives in Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Family: Married to psychiatrist Grace Gabe; three grown children from his 
first marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 Interests: Reading, singing, playing tennis. 
</P>
<P>
 On marrying the woman he had left three days before their wedding 30 years 
earlier: "I think she had a moment of anxiety on the morning of the ceremony 
when I went out for a run." 
</P>
<P>
 On being a university administrator: "Trying to lead college faculty is like 
herding cats." 
</P>
<P>
 On his spiritual beliefs: "I'm certainly not an atheist. When I read some work 
or hear some music that is genius, such as Mahler's First Symphony, I think, my 
God, where does that come from. I attribute it to some greater being. . . . 
(But) I'm much more connected with the material world. I enjoy . . . the sun, 
good clothes, good food and good music." 
</P>
<P>
 On his plans to do more singing: "I think music is fun, and it makes me feel 
good when I sing. I think it has something to do with endorphins. It gives me a 
high."

SHERIDAN WYOMING; TRUE WEST; IN BIG SKY COUNTRY, A TOWN WHERE THE COWBOYS ARE 
REAL AND CARS AREN'T LOCKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRISTOPHER REYNOLDS, TIMES TRAVEL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There had been unpleasantness with her boyfriend. Her ex-boyfriend, she meant. 
And so this young woman, a Sheridan resident for all of her 20 or so years, had 
straggled downtown to the Mint one slow night recently, there to punch up some 
Reba McEntire on the jukebox and sulk beneath the ancient tin ceiling and the 
festival of taxidermy above the bar. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mint is a long-necked Budweiser kind of place, with a neon bucking bronco 
on its sign out front, but this gal (hey, cut me some slack, we're in Wyoming 
here) ordered a daiquiri and set to brooding, her back to the pool table. The 
stuffed animal heads stared blankly at the facing wall's faded photos of trophy 
trout, conquered broncos, anglers, Native Americans and young wranglers who 
were now old men. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next time," she said, "I'm getting a cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
 In Sheridan, a woman can make such a pledge. And a stranger can find a bracing 
taste of the American West. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheridan, population 13,900, sits at the edge of the Bighorn Mountains in 
Wyoming's northeastern corner, lit by a big sky, animated by historic Main 
Street architecture, neighbored by pasturelands, snowy peaks, trout-bearing 
lakes and streams, working ranches, guest ranches and several monuments to 
19th-Century frontier battles (including the one that killed Custer). From 
above, the hilly, rippling high Plains landscape looks like the rumpled linen 
of a great big unmade bed. Yellowstone National Park lies 201 miles to the west 
on Interstate 16; Mount Rushmore lies 280 miles east. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, the city is largely free of the artificial sweeteners that have lured 
so many travelers to showplace cities such as Bozeman and Livingston to the 
northwest, in Montana. But the boutiques and all the rest may be arriving soon. 
</P>
<P>
 A 700-unit housing development is proposed on one end of town. Sam Paul 
Mavrakis, whose family has owned Ritz Sporting Goods in Sheridan for decades, 
has collaborated with his wife, Carol, to convert an old dairy barn in 
neighboring Big Horn into a three-room bed and breakfast operation, the Blue 
Barn, which opened last month. A coffeehouse opened on Main Street six months 
ago, and one of the waitresses there has a ring in her nose.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe it's nothing. The visitors bureau counted a relatively modest 230,000 
tourists to the area last year, and on any day, when you walk the streets of 
Sheridan, the people you see are locally grown Westerners. Men with cowboy hats 
older than I am. Men and women who use toothpicks after every meal. College 
students and high school graduates passing their summers as wranglers at the 
Spear-O-Wigwam Ranch in Sheridan, or Eatons' Ranch in nearby Wolf, or the 14HF 
Bar in Saddlestring, or the Paradise Guest Ranch near Buffalo. Homemakers who 
own rifles. And children who sit, unarmed, in public school classes of a dozen 
or so students. 
</P>
<P>
 The place is Western in a refreshingly uncosmeticized way. And, for the 
record, no more than 15 minutes after the woman with the daiquiri in the Mint 
confessed to me her new ambition, an apparent cowboy ambled in and pulled up a 
stool next to her. When I last saw them, they were still whispering beneath the 
glassy animal eyes. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheridan, named for Civil War Gen. Philip H. Sheridan, was born in 1882 as a 
grid sketched on a brown paper bag by entrepreneur John D. Loucks. It is the 
lowest town in the state, geographically speaking. But, Wyoming being Wyoming, 
it is nevertheless 3,745 feet above sea level. which makes it often hot in 
summer and cold in winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular roads out of town lead to the Bighorn Mountains, which lead 
to many things: Fishing, for trout, usually, in scores of lakes and rivers in 
and around Bighorn National Forest. Hunting for birds and game animals, in 
season. Hiking and horseback riding, most spectacularly near the snowy peaks of 
the 137,000-acre Cloud Peak Wilderness Area, within the national forest. 
Snowmobiling and skiing in winter. And the year-round pursuit of wildlife 
sightings: elk, moose, deer, mountain sheep, bear, fox and coyote. 
</P>
<P>
 The most popular roads into town lead to Main Street, which in the space of 
seven blocks has 16 buildings on the National Register of Historic Places. For 
instance: the 1908 Crescent Hotel, which rises on the former site of the 
original Bucket of Blood saloon, and the 1882 building at 1 South Main, 
Sheridan's oldest building, which once held a general store and now holds a 
pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 If you ignore the second-floor "skyway" tunnel that the Best Western Sheridan 
Center put across Main a few blocks north in the 1970s -- a Jetson's 
convenience in a Tumbleweeds town -- it's not hard to imagine a wooden 
boardwalk under foot and horse troughs alongside it. But it's more educational 
to investigate the enterprises that Main and neighboring streets still sustain. 
</P>
<P>
 At King's Saddlery and King Rope, cowboys from miles around come to buy tools 
of the trade. Though now retired at 72, Don King (no, not the boxing promoter) 
has lived in Sheridan on and off since 1936 and built a reputation as one of 
the nation's premier saddle-makers. The walls jangle with spurs, bridles and 
belt buckles, the scent of leather work hangs in the air, cowbells are sold for 
use on actual cows, and broad sheets advertise home-grown instruction on 
barrel-racing and "the three D's of goat-tying." Determination, dedication, 
devotion. 
</P>
<P>
 In the back stand stacks of hats and sweat shirts for tourists. In workshops 
downstairs, leather is sculpted into saddles, and sisal from Africa (among 
various substances) is heated and twisted into rope. King's sells about 35,000 
lengths of rope yearly, most of it these days including nylon, or polyester or 
polypropylene. Four King sons fill various roles at the store, and a cavernous 
building in back holds Don King's Western Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 The museum is free. On the day I walked in, Don King himself, a grizzled 
fellow in a white hat, was at the counter, surrounded by his massive Western 
artifact collection, which is dominated by more than 500 saddles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just bought six or seven more last weekend," he confessed. "Old junkers, 
but I couldn't say no. When you get the collecting bug, it's just like good 
whiskey: You can't turn it down." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Across the street, next to the Mint, stands Ritz Sporting Goods. Ritz is proof 
that Sheridan remains unglamorized -- its looming yellow and green sign will 
win no prizes for subtlety -- and it may be the only sporting goods store in 
the nation to open daily at 6 a.m. and feature a counter for coffee drinkers. 
For several dozen old ranchers, and one boxer dog dozing beneath a display of 
fishing poles, the Ritz is where one goes each morning to lament the lack of 
rain or muse on the triumphs of the high school football team. 
</P>
<P>
 A few blocks away stands the Sheridan Inn, root of all imported civilization 
in Sheridan. Less than a year after the railroad came to town in late 1892, the 
62-room inn sprung up near the tracks at Fifth Street and Broadway. Its design 
was based, strangely, on a hunting lodge the architect had visited in Scotland. 
Buffalo Bill Cody, a part owner and part-time resident for many years, is said 
to have sat on the inn porch, auditioning acts for his Wild West show. The 
hotel closed to lodgers in 1965, and is now owned jointly by the city and 
county, but a restaurant continues in the old bar and tours are offered by the 
Sheridan Heritage Center (adults: $3). 
</P>
<P>
 The grandest old building in town is the house built by rancher John Kendrick 
from 1908-1913, shortly before he became governor and then a U.S. senator. The 
mansion, now known as Trail End Historic Site, is another piece of strangely 
foreign architecture -- a three-story Flemish Revival eruption atop a hill over 
a city park -- and its carefully preserved interior shows just how eager some 
frontiersmen (and women) were to build North America in Europe's image. There's 
Italian marble around the fireplace, stained glass in the bathrooms, and 
delicately carved oak on the stairwells. Evidently the pines in these hills 
weren't good enough for Kendrick.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While some newcomers to the Plains were importing all these trappings of 
European civilization, of course, others were busy trying to purge the area of 
its existing civilization: the native nations of North America. And Sheridan 
stands in the middle of some of this continent's most contested territory. 
</P>
<P>
 In the space of just a few hours over three days, I stopped at several marked 
old military sites, and took away a deep impression of the carnage that went on 
here in the 1860s and 1870s. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fort Phil Kearny, now a mostly bare hilltop 20 miles south of Sheridan, was 
once a 17-acre compound behind eight-foot walls. It was established in July, 
1866, in the heart of Sioux and Cheyenne hunting grounds and named for a Civil 
War hero. The fort lay along the Bozeman Trail, a popular but perilous shortcut 
to the Oregon Trail. It also served to draw warriors' attention away from the 
transcontinental railroad project then passing through to the south. In 1868, 
after the rail had advanced and hundreds of cavalrymen and Sioux, Cheyenne, 
Crow, Arapaho and Shoshone had killed each other in various ambushes and 
skirmishes, the U.S. Army gave up the fort and the Sioux and others burned it. 
Now a small interpretive center tells that story, displays artifacts and sells 
books and souvenirs. 
</P>
<P>
 * Fetterman Battle Site, about five miles from Fort Phil Kearny, is another 
largely bare hilltop, and the scene of a cavalry defeat on Dec. 21, 1866. On 
that day, Capt. William J. Fetterman, who had bragged of being able to defeat 
the entire Sioux nation with about 80 good soldiers, was out and about with 81 
men. He had orders not to stray too far from Fort Phil Kearny, but upon sight 
of a few Sioux, Cheyenne and Arapaho -- including a young Sioux warrior named 
Crazy Horse -- he violated orders and strayed across Lodge Trail Ridge. The 
stray warriors were a decoy. More than 2,000 more were waiting, and they 
quickly killed Fetterman and all of his men. The whole thing apparently took 
about half an hour. In retrospect, that fiasco offered foreshadowing to the 
most famous of all battle fiascoes in the area: Custer's last stand. 
</P>
<P>
 * Little Bighorn, Mont. (about 75 miles north of Sheridan on I-90), is the 
scene everyone has heard something about. The site, a series of ridges and 
valleys around the Little Bighorn River, had been earmarked for native 
occupation by the U.S. government in the Treaty of 1868. But then gold was 
found nearby, and Army officials became restless about Sioux and Cheyenne 
hunting habits, and in late June, 1876, Army leaders including Lt. Col. George 
A. Custer resolved to attack. But they vastly underestimated the number and 
attitude and capability of their enemies; there were thousands of united Sioux, 
Cheyenne and Arapaho, not the hundreds that were forecast, and Custer evidently 
had the mistaken impression that they would scatter and retreat upon attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheyenne Two Moon, one of the combatants, said later that the defeat of 
Custer's unit took "as long as it takes a hungry man to eat his dinner." In the 
welter of things that went wrong, Custer and about 225 officers and troopers 
under his command died in the last major defeat of the campaign, and an 
industry of Custer speculation and research was spawned. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the event took on such historic resonance was simple timing: The 
word of Custer's defeat reached Washington just in time to taint the nation's 
celebration of its 100th Independence Day. 
</P>
<P>
 The site today includes a well-outfitted visitor center, a stone monument to 
the dead, and a vast, 360-degree view of grass and prairie hills. (Admission to 
the monument property is $4 per vehicle, $2 per pedestrian.) A Crow reservation 
surrounds the site, and a national cemetery holds row upon row of dead from 
World War I, World War II and the Korean War. Hillside markers also show where 
Custer and his men fell, and a four-mile driving route allows visitors to 
follow the chronology of the fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 The markers and literature show a fascinating evolution of official attitude, 
from the old stone marker dedicated to the officers and soldiers killed "while 
clearing the district . . . of hostile Indians" to the newer marker that cites 
"our fallen heroes, both Indian and white, who gave their last full measure in 
defense of their country." In 1991, after legislation was introduced by U.S. 
Rep. Ben Nighthorse Campbell (D-Colo.), Congress and President George Bush 
agreed to change the site's name from Custer Battlefield to Little Bighorn 
Battlefield. 
</P>
<P>
 On the day of my June visit, thunderheads galloped overhead and pelted the 
landscape with rain and lightning while wind tore at the miles of grass. It was 
easy enough to picture a terrible event taking place there.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The stops I made between battle sites were more encouraging. In Buffalo 
(population 3,500, about 35 miles south of Sheridan), a tourist boomlet has 
breathed life into the Main Street with a dozen buildings that date to the 
1890-1920 era, a few quite lavish-looking galleries, and several bars. The old 
Occidental Hotel may not be taking guests (though it is open in summer for 
historic tours), but the Buffalo Bar endures, as does the 21, as does the 
Century Club. I walked into the Century Club at 8:45 a.m. on a Wednesday, and 
through the darkness discerned half a dozen devoted local customers, seated in 
a row at the end of the counter, their eyes narrowing in Old West suspicion as 
I stepped up to ask the barkeep if I could use the bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 In the high, pine-stubbled town of Story (population 650, about 16 miles south 
of Sheridan), for instance, I had a surprisingly good Mexican dinner at the 
Lodore Supper Club. The chef, it turned out, had emigrated from Guadalajara to 
Wyoming more than a decade before. 
</P>
<P>
 At the next table in the Lodore, I found a couple of former Californians who 
had relocated from Oceanside to Story five months before. The man at the table 
was a former cop, who with wide eyes told me about the level of security in his 
new hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a winter night," he said, "this parking lot is full of cars with doors 
unlocked, keys in the ignitions, engines on and rifles in back. And nothing 
goes wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 In Big Horn (population 217, about nine miles south of Sheridan), the Bradford 
Brinton Memorial preserves the ranch and impressive art collection of a wealthy 
rancher and art patron. There's also a free Bozeman Trail Museum in the old 
blacksmith's shop, and a well-used polo field at the Big Horn Equestrian 
Center. The polo contests, a weekend ritual each summer, stem from the arrival 
of Sir Oliver H. Wallop, seventh earl of Portsmouth and grandfather of U.S. 
Sen. Malcolm Wallop. Sir Oliver ran a ranch, installed a tradition of polo and 
made a business of exporting ponies to serve Great Britain's colonial military 
campaigns. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Sheridan and Big Horn, and Sheridan and Story, and Story and Buffalo, 
are the open spaces, the amber waves of grain, the round hills and trickling 
creeks, the shadows of massive and fast-moving clouds. Half the fun of being a 
tourist in this part of Wyoming is finding your way from place to place in that 
landscape. There really are more cows than people, as the old saying goes, and 
there are probably more acres than cows. The question is for how long. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only a handful of people have known about Sheridan," said Sam Paul Mavrakis, 
the new B&B proprietor. "But now, a lot of people in Jackson (Hole) and Aspen 
are getting tired of that, and they want to come here." GUIDEBOOK

 It's not logical, but it happens: Bedraggled consumers spend their springs 
scrambling after cheap air fares and chasing down affordable hotel rooms and 
rental car rates. Right about now they leave on their vacations. And in a week 
or so, on the final day of their trip, they discover A) that they're running 
behind in returning the car to the airport; B) that their gas tank is far from 
full, with no gas station within convenient distance; and C) that they are 
going to have to pay their rental car company nearly $3 a gallon to fill the 
tank with gasoline that elsewhere costs less than half that much. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, this has been a built-in part of the rental car agency business, in 
which Hertz, Avis and their brethren penalize drivers for returning cars with 
tanks less than full. (For some figures on who charges how much where, see 
below.) 
</P>
<P>
 But in the last few years, reservations personnel at Hertz, Avis, Alamo, 
Budget, Dollar, National and other rental companies have been offering another 
option to drivers who don't want to be bothered with refilling their tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 It could save you money, but it's a somewhat perverse program, and travelers 
should consider it carefully before using it. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, usually labeled "fuel service option" or "gas service option," is 
based on the idea of advance purchase. Renters are given the option of paying 
up front for gas that may be needed to refill their tanks later. In exchange 
for handing over their money early, renters get a much better rate per gallon. 
But the renters also waive the right to any refunds for the gas that is left in 
their cars' tanks. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, an Avis renter in Denver, returning a car last week without 
refilling the tank, had this choice: Agree in advance to pay for a tank refill 
at $1.07 per gallon and, in order to get maximum value, return the tank as 
close to empty as possible; or pay nothing up front and face charges of $2.69 
per gallon at the Avis office if the car is returned less than full. 
</P>
<P>
 But if that renter chose the advance-purchase program and returned, as a 
prudent driver should, with some gas remaining in the tank, the 
cost-effectiveness calculations get complicated. Use the advance-purchase 
program and return a car with a 10-gallon tank one-quarter full, and you have 
effectively paid $1.43 per gallon; return with half a tank, and you've paid 
$2.14 per gallon; return with the tank three-fourths full and you've 
effectively paid $4.28 per gallon. It seems unlikely that rental car agencies 
will be losing money in any of these transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, at a time when so much attention is focused on the safety of rental 
car drivers, it seems strange to encounter an industry-wide program whose 
economics encourage driving around in a strange city with as little gas in your 
tank as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates vary from company to company and city to city, as the following week-old 
figures from rental agency airport locations illustrate: 
</P>
<P>
 Avis in San Francisco charges $1.14 per gallon in advance, $2.90 otherwise; in 
Denver, $1.07 in advance, $2.69 otherwise; in Albuquerque, $1.03 in advance, 
$2.59 otherwise. Hertz in San Francisco charges $1.16 in advance, $2.84 
otherwise; in Denver, $1.11 in advance, $2.69 otherwise; in Albuquerque, $1.07 
in advance, $2.59 otherwise. Rates are generally comparable at other companies. 
</P>
<P>
 The economics will vary depending on prevailing rates at service stations. But 
for my money, making time to stop and top off the tank at a gas station, and 
then returning the car, is still easily the wisest alternative.  
</P>
<P>
 Drivers should remember, however, that gas station operators are working their 
own angles on this issue. In Denver, an Avis clerk reported that prices around 
town were running about $1.12 per gallon of self-service unleaded gas but that 
a prominent gas station near the rental car office was asking about $1.45. 
(Things are tough all over for travelers renting cars in Denver; rental cars 
there carry extra fees of $2.98 per day to help cover costs of the city's new 
airport.) 
</P>
<P>
 Another caution: Renters should be certain that reservations clerks understand 
whether they want or don't want the advance-purchase program. One colleague of 
mine took the trouble to refill her gas tank before returning a rental car, 
only to find that the company had enrolled her in its advance-purchase program 
and was charging her the full amount despite the full tank she'd brought them. 
(Fortunately, the reservations clerk promised credit on a future rental.)

NEWS, TIPS & BARGAINS; '95 WILL SEE END OF FREE RIDES AT DENALI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is the last year you'll get a free ride on the shuttle buses that go deep 
into Denali National Park in Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning next summer, the National Park Service will charge fees ranging from 
$12 to $30 a person to ride the buses that have been free to riders since 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fees are among several changes being made at the park, says Russell 
Berry, superintendent of Denali. Other improvements include new, larger buses, 
a nationwide toll-free reservation service for bus and camping tickets 
(800-622-PARK) and improved road maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100,000 people -- or nearly half the annual visitors to the interior of 
the park -- use the shuttle buses each summer. Private traffic is generally 
prohibited for safety and to protect wildlife. The bus system, however, costs 
federal taxpayers about $1.5 million a year and ate up about 22% of the park's 
operating budget, according to Berry. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with the 1995 season, single-trip shuttle bus tickets will cost 
between $12 and $30 per adult, depending on the destination. Children under 12 
will still ride free. Even so, concessionaire ARA will absorb about $22 per 
rider, Berry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The park service is also weighing a proposal to charge climbers attempting Mt 
McKinley or Mt. Foraker $200 to help defray management costs, especially 
rescues. The proposal fits into a wider campaign by Interior Secretary Bruce 
Babbitt to raise public-lands user fees. Already, rafters on the Grand Canyon's 
Colorado River must pay a $75 fee.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Port of London Authority is going all out to celebrate the 100th birthday 
of Tower Bridge, one of the British capital's most popular landmarks. 
</P>
<P>
 During the past year, the bridge was substantially refurbished from the 
massive stone foundations to the tip of the famous towers and a new exhibition 
called "The Celebration Story" was installed to tell the story of what is 
considered one of the engineering marvels of Victorian Britain.It is open daily 
from 10 a.m. Admission is just over $5. 
</P>
<P>
 The great bridge, made of steel and clad in brick and stone, spans the River 
Thames close to the historic tower of London and attracts half a million 
visitors a year. 
</P>
<P>
 On June 30, Prince Charles will unveil a plaque at the bridge -- which was 
opened by his great-great-grandfather, King Edward VII, on June 30, 1894 -- 
launching a waterfront celebration. Scheduled events include a river 
procession, concerts by military and jazz bands and a fireworks display. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days later, on July 2, as the bells of Big Ben chime noon, the huge bridge 
bascules will open to signal the start of another 12 hours of festivities. In 
the evening, performances by military bands, and a fireworks display with 
special laser effects will close the party. WILLIAM TUOHY

WEEKEND ESCAPE: BASS LAKE; LAKE LARK; PRICED RIGHT FOR THE WHOLE BROOD, SKYLAKE 
YOSEMITE CAMP HAS ALL THE TRIMMINGS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN O'DELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER: O'Dell writes for the Business section in 
The Times' Orange County Edition. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As victims of the recession -- my wife had lost a big client and we lost much 
of our discretionary income -- our chances for a family vacation last summer 
were looking pretty grim. 
</P>
<P>
 We wanted the outdoors, but as aging boomers, are no longer enamored of 
sleeping on the ground. Besides, our 11-going-on-16-year-old daughter winced at 
the thought of dirt, bugs, sweat or other unpleasantries. After researching 
family vacation spots via the local bookstore's travel section, we gambled and 
booked a four-day, three-night outing at Skylake Yosemite Camp. Fees for the 
rustic family camp at Bass Lake in Madera County -- on the way to Yosemite 
National Park -- seemed so reasonable we decided we could take our 10-year-old 
niece along. 
</P>
<P>
 About 45 minutes outside of Fresno in the Sierra National Forest, Skylake is a 
youth camp for most of the summer. The family camps are held the last two weeks 
before Labor Day each summer and can be booked for four, six or seven days. 
Shorter two- and three-night mini-camps are available the first three weekends 
of June and the last two weekends of September. 
</P>
<P>
 It proved to be a fairly easy 270-mile drive from our home in Orange County. 
After a routine and boring six-hour trek to Fresno, the scenery perked up as we 
left the freeway and began traveling east across country that once swarmed with 
prospectors and now is dotted with working farms and getaway ranches sporting 
names such as "Happy Valley Acres" and "For Sale by Owner." 
</P>
<P>
 The oak-spotted hills, knee-deep in dry golden grasses, were gorgeous; the 
winding road was a good, quick one; the Sunday traffic was light -- a driving 
enthusiast's dream come true. In almost no time we passed under an old flume 
that still carries water to the valley from a creek far up in the hills and 
then topped a rise for our first glimpse of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not so big as to be overpowering, but Bass Lake is a nice one -- four 
miles long and up to half a mile wide, with almost royal blue water that flows 
in from Willow Creek, a tributary of the San Joaquin River. 
</P>
<P>
 I felt my heart rate slow by about 20 beats a minute as soon as we turned onto 
the lakefront road. My wife said the place approached her idea of heaven -- 
which is to sit on the shore, listen to the water lapping at her feet and watch 
the clouds and the birds soar overhead. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, Bass Lake was a summer stomping ground for the notorious Hell's 
Angels motorcycle club. Gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson immortalized one 
such summer gathering in his 1965 book, "Hell's Angels." But today the lake's 
shores are populated largely with campsites, stands of pine and clusters of 
homes and resorts -- some fancy, some plain. The surface of the warm blue water 
is churned all summer by water skiers and the depths are plumbed by fishermen 
after trout, salmon, catfish, bass and perch. At an elevation of 3,500 feet, 
daytime temperatures in August run into the 80s and nighttime lows seldom drop 
below 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Skylake Yosemite Camp is located on the uphill side of the lakefront road, a 
short hike from the camp's private cove. The girls routinely ran down the 
secluded path in two minutes and panted back up in five or six. Mom and Dad's 
times shall remain unrecorded. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Daily life at the camp centers around the long, low, log-sided lodge, where 
meals are served and where guests are expected to bus and wipe down their own 
tables after each meal (we also swept out our own cabin each day, but hey, it's 
camp, not a resort). The lodge -- actually a long, open room filled with 
folding tables and chairs, sports a brick fireplace at one end -- laid with 
wood that isn't lit during the hot summer but probably comes in handy in the 
winter when the camp is rented out to private groups for retreats and business 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Other camp facilities include a trio of restroom-shower units and 34 screened 
houses -- one for each family. Except for the day a guest drove into a 
forbidden area and broke a pipe, there was always plenty of hot water and never 
a line in the shower rooms. I, of course, didn't know about the lack of hot 
water until I turned on the shower full blast after a dusty horseback ride. 
</P>
<P>
 Camp owner John Howe greeted us as we drove into the camp on our first 
afternoon and gave us a tour of the lodge, which also serves as recreation room 
and gathering point for the 8 a.m. daily sign-ups for riding and water-skiing 
(a few early birds get there at 6 a.m. for first place in line, but we arrived 
at 7:45 and got what we wanted). 
</P>
<P>
 The houses are pretty Spartan: tin-covered roofs and walls that are wood on 
the lower half and window screen on top. Each is 16 feet square and outfitted 
with four sets of bunks and eight wall-mounted shelves. Period. No lights, no 
running water, no rugs, no electrical outlets. But they serve their purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Home for our Sunday-through-Wednesday stay was Cedar Cabin and our last name 
was emblazoned on a sheet of yellow paper stapled next to the front door. Howe 
posts the family name on each cabin to make it easier for campers to become 
acquainted. A list of guests -- with the ages of children included to 
facilitate friend-making -- also is posted all week in the lodge. 
</P>
<P>
 Skylake doesn't call itself a lodge or resort, and if you keep that in mind 
the thin mattresses with their clean-but-stained canvas covers and the 
sometimes saggy bed springs shouldn't be a problem. You bring your own sleeping 
bags to camp and simply plop them atop the mattresses. Saggy springs aside, the 
place was what we'd hoped for. Plenty to do, lots of time to relax, good eats, 
friendly fellow guests and a staff of 15 people who seemed genuinely to care 
that we enjoyed ourselves. 
</P>
<P>
 We spent much of our time at the camp's beach, swimming in the 75-degree water 
and paddling canoes. The girls also fooled with a windsurfing board, but the 
camp doesn't provide instruction so they ended up using it as a paddleboard -- 
and had a ball zooming around the cove. 
</P>
<P>
 Skylake has two 16-foot catamarans, but we don't sail and no one else seemed 
interested, either. Except for a handful of skiers, most people seemed to enjoy 
swimming and lounging on the docks. 
</P>
<P>
 The camp also provides two power boats with drivers: Family groups can charter 
one for hourlong skiing or sightseeing jaunts at $25, and individuals can rent 
ski time in the other at $5.75 for each 15-minute increment. We took a boat 
trip one afternoon and got a great tour of the lake that included a natural 
water slide where Willow Creek empties into the lake. Our daughter tried it, 
the rest of us watched and afterward wished we'd clambered up the rocks and 
tried too. Although we don't ski, the girls giggled wildly when the driver 
cranked up the 100-horsepower outboard and the spray crashed over the bow, 
soaking them at least as well as any stint on water skis would have. 
</P>
<P>
 When we weren't relaxing on the water, my wife and I walked in the forest, 
savoring the clean air and the cinnamon-incense tang of the woods. The girls 
explored, played tennis with two boys one afternoon and played Ping-Pong with 
each other most evenings. And we all rode horses under the tutelage of a 
wrangler who took the time to make sure everyone was comfortable and informed 
about the quirks of his or her mount.  
</P>
<P>
 The fact that many campers are repeat guests was driven home during 
introductions at the opening night campfire when we discovered we were one of 
only six first-time families. One family announced that this was their 18th 
trip, but that was topped by the woman who said her family had been coming to 
Skylake's family camps for 28 consecutive years. Reservations can be made by 
phone or mail, but be forewarned: Family camps fill up fast. We got one of the 
last four-day slots last summer with a phone call made in May. (At press time, 
there were still cabins available for this summer's second session, beginning 
Aug. 28.) Budget for Four

DESTINATION: HAWAII; FAR FROM OAHU'S MADDING CROWD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 "I found a coconut," Henri yells as he runs through the campground to our 
tents at Malaekahana State Recreation Area, near the northern tip of Oahu. 
</P>
<P>
 The exotic discovery is a big thrill for an adventurous 7-year-old. He marches 
proudly to the next campsite to show off the heavy prize. 
</P>
<P>
 About a dozen boys, camping with a youth group, are shouting for their camp 
leader: "Get Le. Get Le." 
</P>
<P>
 Leuma Leatamauga is a big Hawaiian dude. He grabs his machete in one hand and 
the pale green coconut, the size of a football, in the other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big bugger, Henri," Le says, hacking away at the outer husk like a 
pro. As a boy, Le climbed coconut trees for fun. Now, surrounded by youngsters, 
he cracks the top off the coconut with a single swipe of the big knife and 
hands it over. Clear juice spills to the ground. Henri takes a sip right out of 
the shell. "It's sweet, it's good," he says, passing it on. Over fresh coconut 
juice, the kids toast new buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 " Mahalo, Le," we say. It's Hawaiian for thank you . 
</P>
<P>
 The coconut toast is a special moment in our second week on Oahu that began 
when we left the hordes of sun worshipers behind in Waikiki and headed for "the 
country" -- the island's famous North Shore. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We haggle a $150-per-week deal -- a pretty good price -- on a bright-blue 
convertible. With the top down, music on full blast and our baby daughter, 
Presley, 1, rocking out in her rented car seat, we cruise east, past Diamond 
Head, out of the suburbs and into a political struggle. More than 100 native 
Hawaiians have taken over Makapuu Beach Park and are spilling onto the highway 
in front of us, waving placards calling for a sovereign Hawaiian nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Busy Hawaii 83 (Kamehameha Highway, on some maps) hugs the windward coast, 
past rich taro patches, banana trees and coconut palms. To our left, 
near-vertical mountains draped in rain forest shoot straight into the clouds. 
</P>
<P>
 Our free state campground near Laie is clean, full of families and perfectly 
located as a base to discover the treasures of the North Shore. The only 
downside is the relentless trade winds that blow 24 hours a day. It's great 
incentive to hop in the convertible and go exploring. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawaii 83 passes right by the famous surf spots of Waimea Bay and Sunset 
Beach. In summer the waves are small but still pack a punch. The color of the 
sea at these beaches is the bluest we've ever seen, and snorkeling is a treat. 
Even though we're less than an hour's drive from Waikiki, only a fraction of 
the tourists seems to make the journey here to the other side of the island. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest crowd of tourists we find is lined up outside Matsumoto's Shave 
Ice store in the quaint artist town of Haleiwa, south of Waimea Bay. Hawaii's 
answer to the snow cone is cheap and refreshing. Smalls -- the size of a 
cantaloupe -- cost $1 here. The large size is $1.20. We get adventurous by 
ordering one shave ice the local way -- with sweet, red adzuki beans on the 
bottom. "I don't like it," our finicky 5-year-old, Matilda, quickly concludes. 
</P>
<P>
 But Matty has adopted one Hawaiian tradition with a passion. She loves the 
fragrant flower necklaces. Leis aren't just a gimmick handed out to tourists at 
the airport. Strands hang on statues, from roadside trees as memorials and 
around the necks of locals. We see people wearing leis made of plumeria, ti 
leaves, candy and even wrapped-up quarters. 
</P>
<P>
 Between hiking rain forest trails, bodysurfing baby waves and telling ghost 
stories around campfires, our excursion to the north passes much too quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The road back to Honolulu is through the red-dirt heartland of Oahu. The scent 
of pineapple rises from the fields. Crop workers are handpicking the fruit.

<P>
 We're at the airport two hours early and all is running smoothly as we hand 
over our tickets to get on board our island hopper to the Big Island of Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 "Excuse me, you're missing a boarding pass," the Hawaiian Airlines ticket 
agent tells us. Henri and Matilda are halfway down the busy corridor leading to 
the plane. Presley is hanging precariously from a baby sling. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'll have to bring the children back. We need the pass before you can fly," 
the man says firmly. There must be some mistake. We frantically search through 
our carry-on luggage and papers for the missing ticket. Nada! We backtrack our 
steps through the airport. Zip! 
</P>
<P>
 There's a final boarding call for our flight and we're still in limbo. The 
doorway is about to close when a supervisor with a computer printout of our 
names on a passenger list rushes to our rescue. 
</P>
<P>
 He makes a scrawl with a green marker and smiles. "Everything's OK. Have a 
nice trip." 
</P>
<P>
 "Mahalo," we say. Grabbing our gear and the keikis (children) , we run to 
catch our plane.

TASTE OF TRAVEL: THE SOUTH: HUNGERING FOR HUSH PUPPIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT MACKLE, Mackle is dining critic of the Atlanta Journal and 
Constitution. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Tales explaining the origins of our favorite foods are generally more 
satisfying than whatever the stark, verifiable truth may be. 
</P>
<P>
 Was there ever (for instance) one particular young pig who, trapped in a 
burning barn, became the prototypical and proverbial first serving of barbecue? 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows? Sounds right. 
</P>
<P>
 Details may differ, of course. Perhaps the pig encountered a forest fire. 
Still, at gut level -- so to speak -- we accept these and other culinary 
creation myths without question. 
</P>
<P>
 Here in the South, where people tell stories about nearly everything, no one 
disputes the myth of the hush puppy, which goes something like this: 
</P>
<P>
 When the first men (and perhaps women) caught the first fish out in the then 
wild and unpolluted rivers, they quickly mixed up a mess of cornmeal batter -- 
corn being the South's main grain until well into this century -- and fried the 
fillets to a crisp. 
</P>
<P>
 Smelling the savory fish, the coon dogs, hound dogs and deer dogs who are the 
familiars of any Southern campfire whimpered and hollered and rolled in the 
dust and made general nuisances of themselves. To keep the mutts quiet, the 
cook tossed out bits of batter that had separated from the fish during the 
frying process. The dogs ate up and shut up. This pleased the master of the 
hunt, who tipped the cook extra. 
</P>
<P>
 Next time, dogs as well as cook knew they were onto something. The cook 
prepared extra batter for the same number of fillets. After the fish were fried 
and the hunters served, the cook added chopped onion and a little sugar and hot 
pepper sauce to a batter composed of cornmeal, self-rising flour, canned milk, 
egg and salt. Then he let it rest and thicken while the dogs proceeded to 
whimper, holler and roll in the dust. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, dipping spoonful after careful spoonful of batter into the fat -- 
probably lard, though few people today will admit that it imparts so much 
flavor to fried foods -- the cook produced a pile of fishless campfire 
fritters. Throwing them one by one to the dogs, who had by then become his fast 
friends, he called out, "Hush puppies, hush puppies." 
</P>
<P>
 They did. Thus was the legend born. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the facts, hush puppies -- more healthily fried in corn, peanut or 
canola oil today -- are an essential part of Southern dining. Round or tubular, 
thick or thin, sweet or slightly salty, crisp outside and yielding within, they 
are traditionally served with seafood -- as well as with fried chicken dinners 
-- up and down the coastal corn belt that stretches from the Carolinas to 
Texas. Because they are considered an essential part of a meal -- such as fruit 
garnishes on the hamburger-patty-and-cottage-cheese diet plate -- they're often 
not even mentioned on regional menus. 
</P>
<P>
 Where to find good ones? Everywhere: in soul food cafes, small town catfish 
barns, dockside snack bars, big-deal city fish houses -- even frozen, in 
grocery store convenience packages. 
</P>
<P>
 But some of the best are fried in the coastal Low Country -- an outdoorsy, 
exotic strip of swamp running northeast from the Florida line to Charleston, 
S.C. Here, the cuisine of campfires and fish houses is almost extravagantly 
valued. Roasted marsh oysters, catfish pulled from the rivers and quickly 
fried, boiled shrimp from tidal creeks and sweet bay scallops seared in butter 
are the esteemed equivalents of the hautest harvest of any European kitchen or 
Pac-Rim sushi net. But take care to visit during the warmer months; many of 
these places close their welcoming doors from about November to sometime in 
March. 
</P>
<P>
 To find these briny delights and their essential, traditional, often ethereal 
hush puppy accompaniments, visitors must exit the superhighways and forget 
about fancy restaurants with pedigreed chefs. The roads -- U.S. 17 and South 
Carolina 21, for instance -- are well designed and carefully maintained. 
Because traffic is slower, they also offer better views than what's available 
on the interstate. How much attention, for example, can you give to an 
alligator or blue heron at 75 m.p.h.? 
</P>
<P>
 We coastal Southerners like to drive easier and slower. We stop at graveyards, 
as well as villages, because we like to keep in touch with kissing cousins. And 
keeping in touch goes double when we're hungry for traditional coastal and 
campfire cuisine, which is most of the time. 
</P>

 Bite for bite, McIntosh County, Ga., boasts the best concentration of 
blue-ribbon hush puppies and seafood in the region. Shellman Bluff, a shrimping 
village between Interstate 95 and the ocean, numbers two rustic fish houses and 
spectacular views of the tidal marshes among its otherwise minimal attractions. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed's Kitchen, a set of retired mobile homes in a secluded pine grove, looks 
like some super-extended family's retirement home. There are two or three 
entrances (any will do), mix-and-match dinette tables and chairs and paper 
place mats that serve as menus. 
</P>
<P>
 Speed's serves what may be the county's premier hush pups. They come to the 
table hot, round and slightly sweet. Dipped in tartar sauce? Perfecto. On the 
side? Depend upon fried bay scallops in feathery breading, home-style blue crab 
au gratin, local flounder stuffed with crab and fine-cut coleslaw. Say "yes" to 
dessert if they have pecan pie. It's all served by polite women who are 
enthusiastic about what they have to sell. BYOB applies -- bring your own 
bottle if you care to. (Here and at the following two places, figure on 
spending $9-$12 per person for hush puppies, seafood entree and side dishes.) 
</P>
<P>
 Two blocks away, Hunter's Cafe and Lounge is creek-side headquarters for the 
eye-popping marsh panorama (spartina grass, tidal creek, pleasure boats, 
aristocratic sabal palms) and small but satisfying pups. The atmospheric 
package also includes whole fried flounder, crab stew, rough-board picnic 
tables and benches, laid-back attitude, fully functioning barroom and doors 
that start swinging around 6 a.m. The place looks rougher than it is so 
tourists need not worry. But you can get your food to go. Then, parked across 
the narrow road from Hunter's, you can lean back, pop pup after pup into your 
mouth (washing it down with cold beer) in the privacy of your own rental car -- 
feeling just like a coastal native. That is, of course, if you have a 
designated driver. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby, in the historic rice-and-lumber town of Darien, Archie's Restaurant -- 
an almost streamlined diner that has hunkered alongside U.S. 17 for two 
generations -- serves freshly fried pups, local shrimp and fresh-water catfish 
from the neighboring Altamaha River. Portions are generous: perhaps three dozen 
medium-size shrimp and half a dozen comparable pups per regular order. Because 
Archie's functions as Darien's cafe, upscale truck stop and general meeting 
ground, count on respectable burgers, sandwiches and Southern vegetables too. A 
few display cases of small antiques and country collectibles are on view, with 
modest price tags, near the check-out counter. 
</P>
<P>
 A few miles to the north, Love's Seafood -- a neat, bigger-than-it-looks shack 
beside U.S. 17 at the Ogeechee River bridge just south of Savannah -- is 
reliable for hush puppies and lightly breaded-and-fried shrimp and scallops 
(about $9). Stop there. Slaw is pickley-puckery, red rice (a Low Country 
standby) ketchupy. Fried catfish, the house-promoted specialty, was way 
overcooked last time I had it. The service is friendly, though, and the river 
view is authentic Low Country melt-your-heart. 
</P>
<P>
 In touristy Hilton Head, S.C., the place for pups and shrimp is the relatively 
upscale, decidedly touristy Crazy Crab. Like almost everything on Hilton Head, 
this place is fairly new. Inch-and-a-half "special recipe" hush puppy balls 
come with the fried shrimp dinner (about $14) or peel-and-eat  
</P>
<P>
 shrimp (half a pound, about $10). There are two Crazy Crabs on Hilton Head. 
You want the one on South Carolina 278 near the mainland bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguably the best hush puppies in the region are prepared within sight of the 
Atlantic, on rural St. Helena Island. Located east of picturesque Beaufort 
(which is chock-full of the antebellum mansions and outsize characters that 
inspired "The Prince of Tides" and "The Big Chill"). St. Helena is home to one 
of the region's notable eateries, the Shrimp Shack. The place is little more 
than that: two screen-porch-with-benches dining areas (one that's raised up to 
catch the spectacular marsh-and-ocean panorama), a set of pass-through order 
and pickup windows and a specialty in two sizes: shrimp burger and super shrimp 
burger. These crab-cakelike, one-handers draw visitors, sea island retirees, 
construction workers, local farmers and military types from nearby Navy and 
Marine bases for daily refills. Operated by the wives of shrimpers (who sell 
retail and wholesale across the highway at Gay Fish Co.), Shrimp Shack pairs 
wonderfully sweet, crisp torpedo-shaped pups (six to an order) with the creamy, 
tender, shrimp burgers and with equally luscious fried scallops. Slaw is barely 
OK but skip the red rice. Note: No booze is either sold or allowed. (Around $5 
for burger and hush puppies.) 
</P>
<P>
 Pup lovers heading in the other direction -- to Florida or Cumberland Island 
National Seashore -- should not miss Seagle's, a considerably more genteel 
restaurant in the atmospheric, lightly restored Riverview Hotel in quaint St. 
Marys, Ga. There, accompanied by mixed drinks, table service and dockside 
views, the crisp, round, oniony hush puppies are served with fried and broiled 
bay scallops (about $7.50-$10.50 a plate). Nut-sweet and opalescent, the 
bivalves are delicious enough to throw even the most dedicated pup-hunter off 
the scent. But because St. Marys -- and the hotel -- are ground zero for 
starting and ending trips to wild, gorgeous Cumberland Island National 
Seashore, it can be picked up soon enough. The restorative qualities of hush 
puppies -- as is well known in the region -- are incalculable. So much so, in 
fact, that the pups themselves have become the stuff of legends. GUIDEBOOK

DESTINATION: INDIA; WRITTEN IN STONE; NEAR BOMBAY, EXPLORING MONUMENTS TO 
PRAYER AND POWER ON THE STARK DECCAN PLATEAU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

in New Delhi.

<P>
 Deep in the stony bowels of one of the most astonishing monuments to religious 
faith and civil engineering prowess ever fashioned, the barefoot guide motioned 
with his flashlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "Come," the man in the loose white robe said mysteriously. I followed, picking 
my way dimly and with difficulty through columns richly worked into gingerbread 
showing members of the Hindu pantheon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here," my guide said. I stopped in the penumbra. He swung his flashlight up 
at the second-story ceiling to reveal images of Siva and his consorts, flaking 
away but still very recognizable. "All the sexual positions," he said, though 
no explanation was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Here, on a rocky ridge about 180 miles up-country from Bombay, thousands of 
masons, stone carvers and sculptors set out 12 centuries ago to do something 
that has not been equaled since. 
</P>
<P>
 The end product, the Kailasanatha temple hewn out of volcanic basalt at 
Ellora, is one of the great treasures of Indian art and culture. Art historian 
Percy Brown called it "the most stupendous single work of art ever executed in 
India." 
</P>
<P>
 That covers a lot of ground, but there is no disagreeing that it is a 
wonderful weekend destination if (like me) you're visiting Bombay and you've 
had an overdose of that city's frenetic pace, its moist, fetid Arabian Sea air 
and hustling business folk and beggars -- and long for a few days of open space 
and quiet. 
</P>
<P>
 I combined Ellora with another historical curiosity on the Deccan plateau: 
Daulatabad, a now-dead capital founded by a man who must have been the Pol Pot 
of his day, since he chose a site about as hospitable and well-watered as the 
badlands of southern New Mexico on which to plant thousands of his unfortunate 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, it was a mini-vacation in the form of a lesson in morals: From 
a hymn hewn in stone to the power of religious belief it was but a brief drive 
to the mighty, brooding ruins left by Sultan Muhammad Tughluq's megalomania. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Both destinations are an easy day's outing from Aurangabad, a historic city of 
old gates and thick, crenelated walls, where at any of a number of excellent 
hotels, the India explorer can gulp a cool sundowner, wash the dust off with a 
dip in the pool and get a good Western dinner or Indian thali.  
</P>
<P>
 In Aurangabad one can also glimpse what is sometimes referred to as "the poor 
man's Taj Mahal." Or woman's, to be precise. The honoree was Rabia Daurani, the 
deceased wife of the Mogul emperor Aurangzeb. By some estimates, only 1/300th 
of the funds were expended on this Taj knockoff, called Bibika Maqbara, as were 
lavished on the original. The end result, built in the late 17th Century, about 
a quarter century after the Taj, is only about half the size of the more famous 
garden tomb in the north Indian city of Agra. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Western Ghats mountain range, inland from Bombay and the sun-burned, 
sere Deccan plain, what art historians call "monumental sculpture" -- the 
wholesale carving, rather than construction, of structures for human habitation 
or use -- was first begun in the last two centuries before the birth of Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 The genre reached its acme at Ellora, 20 miles northwest of Aurangabad. For 
three centuries, people of three faiths -- Buddhist, Hindu and Jain -- sliced 
their way into a rocky ridge and gouged out vast chapels and monasteries of 
incredible complexity, artistry and delicacy. 
</P>
<P>
 As I ambled from cave to cave, I was followed by a silent man who humbly held 
up a great piece of polished silvery metal to catch rays of the morning sun and 
beam them into the caves so I could see the lovingly carved faces of the 
Buddha, impossibly round-breasted maidens and other figures. In gratitude, I 
gave him 10 rupees, about 30 cents, and he smiled. 
</P>
<P>
 Paths lead to most of the Ellora's 34 caves,but it must be pointed out that 
there are some rough patches and that this is not a trip for the disabled or 
anyone who has trouble negotiating steps. 
</P>
<P>
 The jewel in Ellora's necklace of stonework is opposite the parking area, and 
marked No. 16 in guidebooks and at the site. In the middle of the 8th Century, 
it is believed, this vision of an innovative, stupefying tribute to the Hindu 
gods took shape. 
</P>
<P>
 The name of its audacious author has been lost over the centuries, it seems. 
But under his guidance or tutelage, an army of craftsmen set out not to build a 
temple to the great god Siva, but to carve one out of solid rock. The labor, it 
is believed, lasted a century. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as Michelangelo saw a statue in a block of marble and sought to liberate 
it, these anonymous Indian masters and artisans envisaged a house of worship in 
a 3-million-square-foot mass of brownish-black, solidified lava, then set out 
with hand-held tools and primitive potash-charcoal explosives to create it. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cutters began at the top of Ellora's ridge, and working downward, cut 
three great trenches at right angles in the form of an inverted U. (Men did 
most of the craftsmanship, scholars believe, while women did the coolie work of 
hauling away the rubble. Some things in India never change, it seems.) 
</P>
<P>
 The end result is really a colossal pun, it struck me as I entered the temple 
with a group of excited tourists from the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh. Over 
the decades, through the heat of summers and the lashing rains of the monsoon 
season, thousands of people sculpted a mountain to make a mountain: kailasa, 
the fabled Himalayan abode of Siva. 
</P>
<P>
 The great pyramidlike mount, topped by an octagonal cupola, now sits on the 
back of huge elephant caryatids. Kailasanatha is 165 feet long by 109 feet 
wide, while its stylized peak rises almost 95 feet above the man-made floor, 
more than half again as high as the presidential heads at Mount Rushmore 
National Memorial. (As a further comparison, the interior of the Notre Dame 
cathedral in Paris measures 427 by 157 feet, with the roof 115 feet high.) 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the sanctuary, entered through an ornate doorway flanked by images of 
river goddesses, one can see lovely carvings of Siva, his consort Parvati and 
the god's appearance as Nataraja, the cosmic dancer. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second floor (and it was there that it really struck me that I was not 
inside a building, but in a gigantic piece of sculpture hewn from a monolith), 
sits the yoni lingam, the stylized male and female reproductive organs that are 
the symbol of this most complex of Hindu deities, as well as the exacting 
carvings of "all the positions." 
</P>
<P>
 As the carvers worked, they left enormous stone blocks that were then worked 
into free-standing pillars, shrines, elephants, the entrance gate and porch and 
friezes showing inspiring scenes from the Hindu epics, the Ramayana and 
Mahabharata, about heroic kings who fought to regain their rightful thrones. 
</P>
<P>
 Around the temple, columned arcades have been cut into the overhanging cliff, 
and it was there that, along with friendly and inquisitive Indian visitors, I 
sought shelter from the noonday sun and answers to some questions about 
Hinduism. 
</P>
<P>
 To make Ellora and Ajanta (which boasts exquisite but badly damaged Buddhist 
cave paintings) better known as travel destinations, the Indian government, 
armed with Japanese aid of more than $60 million, has launched a development 
project. The first phase, already underway, includes upgrading Aurangabad's 
airport, planting trees, repairing roads, stringing electric lines, improving 
water and sewage facilities and monument conservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Will the cost be passed on to the visitor? I don't know. For the moment, it 
costs nothing to visit the caves at Ellora, and a ticket to enter Kailasanatha 
is but 50 paise -- about 1 1/2 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Driving back to Aurangabad from Ellora on dusty roads, one crosses thorny 
scrubland with broad and open vistas. Suddenly, about 20 minutes from Ellora, 
the ruins of three rings of stout black walls, still imposing in their 
massiveness, rise from the wasteland. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Daulatabad, the remains of Muhammad Tughluq's southern capital, which 
the Delhi sultan erected as an exercise in what the geopoliticians call "power 
projection" about the time that the Black Plague was ravaging Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 In his lucid and entertaining "A New History of India" (Oxford, $17.95), a 
great travel companion for any tourist who wants to keep his Moguls straight 
from his Marathas, UCLA history professor Stanley Wolpert recounts the story of 
this remarkable man who catapulted to power over the corpses of his father and 
brother to reign over much of India from 1325 to 1354. 
</P>
<P>
 Muhammad Tughluq appears to have been a hypocrite, compelling his subjects to 
obey the "ablutions, prayers and the principles of Islam" while doing nothing 
of the sort himself. His rule was contested by Hindu chieftains in south India, 
however, so in 1327, he forced many nobles and officials of his court to 
abandon their homes in Delhi and journey southward to Daulatabad, more than 500 
miles distant. 
</P>
<P>
 Many died on the incredibly arduous journey. Surveying the parched, wind-swept 
landscape today, it is hard to understand why this hardhearted emperor (who did 
little to alleviate the severe drought and famine that gripped India in 
1335-42) chose this site, which is subject to the dry, furnacelike heat of the 
Deccan plateau and lacks a year-round supply of water, for a capital site. 
</P>
<P>
 How the lords and ladies of the court must have pined for Delhi! Little 
wonder, then, that in 1345 rebellion against Muhammad Tughluq broke out in 
Daulatabad and other Deccan cities, led by discontented Muslim nobles. 
</P>
<P>
 Lording it over the ruins, perched on a volcanic rock that rises more than 800 
feet above the sun-scoured plain, sits the real reason I had wanted to see 
Daulatabad: the fort of Deogiri. It was more than 100 degrees by the time I 
arrived one afternoon last April, but I meant to climb to the top to experience 
what was, for medieval India, a state-of-the-art fortification. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the ring formed by Daulatabad's walls, many segments of which are still 
standing in excellent shape, a man in his 20s materialized holding a stubby 
piece of wood and a can of kerosene. "Want guide?" he asked. "Ji ha, " I 
assented in Hindi. 
</P>
<P>
 For the next half-hour, guided by his sputtering yellow flame, we took the 
path that any soldier unfortunate enough to have been ordered to attack Deogiri 
would have had to follow. If Ellora is a prayer in stone, at Daulatabad one 
sees a no less artful monument to man's ability to be efficiently and deviously 
inhumane. 
</P>
<P>
 First, the assailant (or today's tourist) trudges up a slope that was made 
steeper on purpose, then crosses a moat that used to be filled with eagerly 
waiting crocodiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The path plunges underground and into blackness. From surface level, large 
slots have been cut for the defenders to dump hot coals or caldrons of boiling 
water onto the hapless infiltrators, or to fill the tunnel with poisonous 
fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 The tunnel splits, then meets, an unspoken invitation to the confused 
attackers to kill each other in the dark. As in the opening scene of "Raiders 
of the Lost Ark," heavy stones were positioned so the defenders could bring 
them crashing down onto the enemy. 
</P>
<P>
 At its end, the tunnel becomes so narrow that one by one, the attackers would 
have had to crawl forward, no doubt to meet a reception committee armed with a 
beheading ax. 
</P>
<P>
 "Seven walls, 52 gates, 306 cannons, 15 km. perimeter of wall," I jotted down 
in my notebook as my guide rattled off Daulatabad's formidable defenses. Yet at 
the summit, where cannons (including one named "Creator of Storms") were 
positioned to rake the Deccan for miles around, there was little sign of life 
except the repetitive, single-note song of a coppersmith bird. What had been a 
capital is today, like so many sights in India, a melancholy reminder of the 
magnificence, glory and power of the past. GUIDEBOOK

DESTINATION: ENGLAND; BEAR COUNTRY; FOLLOWING IN THE FOOTSTEPS OF 
WINNIE-THE-POOH . . . OVER POOHSTICKS BRIDGE TO OWL'S HOUSE, THE HUNDRED ACRE 
WOOD AND OTHER ENCHANTED PLACES IN EAST SUSSEX IMMORTALIZED BY AUTHOR A.A. 
MILNE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many of the enchanted spots where Winnie-the-Pooh, Eeyore, Rabbit, Piglet, 
Owl, Tigger, Kanga, Roo and Christopher Robin found adventure are tucked away 
in the English county of East Sussex, about an hour's drive south and slightly 
east from London. Poohsticks Bridge, Galleon's Lap, Owl's house, Roo's sandy 
pit, the North Pole, the Hundred Acre Wood and the dark and mysterious Forest 
can be found amid the villages of Hartfield, Maresfield and Crowborough, 
southwest of the larger and better-known town of Tunbridge Wells. 
</P>
<P>
 It was there, at Cotchford Farm in Hartfield, that author A.A. Milne and his 
family spent their vacations, and there that Milne's son and his stuffed 
animals became models for the characters in the Winnie-the-Pooh stories that 
have charmed children and adults throughout the world since the first book, 
"Winnie-the-Pooh," was published in 1926, followed in 1928 by "The House at 
Pooh Corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Some places, such as Poohsticks Bridge and the tiny shop where Christopher 
Robin Milne and his nanny traveled in search of candy, are well marked and 
easily accessible. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding others requires a good map of the area, Christopher Robin Milne's 
autobiography, "The Enchanted Places," and some imagination. But the treasure 
that awaits, especially for those who have grown to love Christopher Robin and 
his friends, is worth the effort. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 West of Tunbridge Wells is the village of Upper Hartfield, the site of 
Poohsticks Bridge. A rustic wood sign points the way down a wooded path lined 
with dark-green holly bushes and towering oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a beautiful walk to the bridge, especially in the late afternoon, when 
the sun illuminates shiny holly leaves, while other sections of the path are 
dark and mysterious. Some of the bigger trees look as if they'd make perfect 
homes for brainy owls and tiny pigs and lovable bears. It's easy to see how a 
boy and his Bear could find adventure here. 
</P>
<P>
 The footpath leaves the woods and, after several yards, turns to the right 
along meadows lined with split-rail fences. 
</P>
<P>
 No fences or gates block the way to the bridge, but the surface can be rutted 
or muddy and is not suitable for wheelchairs or bicycles. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who plans to play Poohsticks should gather twigs in the woods, because 
none usually can be found at the bridge. Almost everyone who goes to Poohsticks 
Bridge does play Poohsticks. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who have forgotten, or perhaps never knew, the game of Poohsticks 
came about one day when Winnie-the-Pooh accidentally dropped a fir cone -- we 
Yanks would call it a pine cone -- from the bridge into the lazy stream below. 
</P>
<P>
 At first Pooh was perplexed by his clumsiness, but then he decided to watch 
the water for a while. Soon he was surprised to see his fir cone floating along 
on the other side of the bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 He may have been a Bear of Very Little Brain, but Pooh realized it would be 
fun to drop two or more cones -- or later, sticks -- from the bridge and have a 
contest to see which would come out first on the other side. 
</P>
<P>
 And so the game of Poohsticks was born, and continues to be played by 
countless children and grown-ups. There's something compelling about tossing 
sticks over the wooden bridge railing and running to the opposite rail to watch 
them emerge, something magical about the place that draws even the stuffiest of 
adults into the game. It might be the simplicity of the idea, or the desire to 
be a child again, if only for a few moments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Poohsticks Bridge is a wood structure that looks very much as it does in 
Ernest A. Shepard's illustrations for the Milne books, often with a young 
child, not unlike Christopher Robin, hanging over the rail, watching for his 
stick to float by and shouting with glee when it appears. 
</P>
<P>
 The dirt path continues past the bridge to the intersection of two narrow 
roads. The right fork leads northeast to Cotchford Farm, where the Milne family 
vacationed. To the west and south is Ashdown Forest, known simply as the Forest 
in the Pooh books. 
</P>
<P>
 North of the farm is the center of the village of Hartfield and a tiny shop 
called Pooh Corner, or Christopher Robin's Sweet Shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300-year-old Queen Anne-style building is at the edge of Hartfield's High 
Street, set down a few feet beyond a grassy slope. A Shepard drawing of 
Christopher Robin and Winnie-the-Pooh over the door leaves no doubt this is the 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Visitors to the shop can find bull's-eye candies similar to the ones 
Christopher Robin Milne used to buy with his nanny, Alice, as well as hundreds 
of Pooh-related books and gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 The store is stuffed from floor to rafters with needlework kits, note cards, 
pencil cases and other children's gifts, postcards, T-shirts, sweat shirts and 
pricey but authentic-looking stuffed versions of Pooh and his friends. Most of 
the Poohs here are Shepard's sketchlike designs rather than the more stylized, 
red-jacketed Disney version of Pooh that is better-known in the United States. 
Pooh lovers, beware: It's easy to lose many pounds -- the monetary kind -- in 
this tiny shop.  
</P>
<P>
 Among the extensive book selection is "The Enchanted Places," Christopher 
Robin Milne's explanation of how his stuffed animals and the places near his 
home came to be known and loved worldwide. (Published by Methuen, "The 
Enchanted Places" is generally available in English book shops for about $13, 
but not in the United States.) 
</P>
<P>
 Milne describes the area near Cotchford Farm, the Posington Wood and Ashdown 
Forest as "a gay and friendly wood, the sort of wood you could happily walk 
through at night, feeling yourself a skillful rather than a brave explorer." 
Piglet's beech tree was in the middle of the Forest, and Kanga and Roo liked to 
spend quiet afternoons in a sandy part of the Forest down by Galleon's Lap. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the name is different, no one questions the location of Galleon's 
Lap, which A.A. Milne described as "an enchanted place at the very top of the 
Forest." Galleon's Lap actually is Gill's Lap, a wooded area at the 
intersection of the B2026 and the road from Forest Row. 
</P>
<P>
 It was to this comforting spot that Christopher Robin and Pooh went in the 
last chapter of "The House at Pooh Corner," when they both knew their lives 
were about to change as Christopher got older. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Five Hundred Acre Wood (known in the books as the Hundred Acre Wood, 
home of Owl's "Chestnuts" is very different from the Forest. "It is a real 
forest with giant beech trees, all dark and mysterious," Christopher Milne 
writes. "You would indeed need to be a brave explorer to venture into the Five 
Hundred Acre at night, and I never did." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the places mentioned in the Pooh books are accessible from public 
paths and bridle ways, although some, like the North Pole, are on privately 
owned land. (The North Pole, at least as discovered by Pooh and his friends, is 
near Gill's Lap, east of the B2110 and across a narrow, shallow stream.) 
</P>
<P>
 Although the stories of A.A. Milne are its most famous product, England's 
Ashdown Forest area does offer more than the world of Christopher Robin.  
</P>
<P>
 Two vineyards, an outdoor recreation area, a restored steam railway and a 
Georgian village all are within a short distance of Poohsticks Bridge and other 
Winnie-the-Pooh-related places. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tunbridge Wells is the Pantiles, a colonnaded walk through elegant shops, 
pubs and cafes, at one end of which is the Chalybeate Spring, where 
18th-Century royalty went to drink the healing waters. Special events during 
the year include several days of Georgian festivities during the summer and 
special programs at Easter and Christmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the Pantiles, Tunbridge Wells is a bustling community with a large 
shopping mall, many restaurants and shops, and a train station with service to 
London and throughout England. 
</P>
<P>
 It's fun to mount an "expotition," as Pooh called it, to all the "real," and 
the enchanted places. But even a visit to the Pooh Corner shop and Poohsticks 
Bridge, the two most easily reached spots, conveys the charm, the tranquillity 
and the enchantment of the area as it existed nearly 70 years ago for a little 
boy and his Bear. GUIDEBOOK

<P>
 Getting there: You can take a train from London to Tunbridge Wells or to East 
Grinstead and rent a car. Or you can rent a car at either London airport 
(Gatwick or Heathrow) and drive there. East Sussex, the county where most 
Winnie-the-Pooh sites are located, is about an hour's drive from London. From 
the airports, take the M25 south to Exit 6, which is the A22, and then continue 
south on the A22 to East Grinstead, east on the A264 to the B2026, and then 
south on the B2026 to Hartfield. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Poohsticks Bridge: About 300 yards past the center of Hartfield, the road 
(Route B2026) bears to the left and south toward Maresfield. About two miles 
beyond the fork is a sign for Chuck Hatch, and almost immediately after that is 
a well-marked right turn toward Marsh Green and Newbridge. The Poohsticks 
Bridge parking lot -- or car park, as the locals say -- is about 150 yards 
farther down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For more information: The Ashdown Forest information center, one mile east of 
Wych Cross off the A22, provides information about activities and facilities in 
the forest. (The center is closed in winter.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ordnance survey maps, available in hiking shops and bookstores in England, are 
invaluable for touring Pooh country. (You'll want Pathfinder No. 1269 for the 
Uckfield and Heathfield area, and No. 1248 for the Tunbridge Wells area.)

CRUISE VIEWS: BUOYED BY TIME-SHARE PROGRAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHIRLEY SLATER and HARRY BASCH, Slater and Basch travel as guests of the 
cruise lines. Cruise Views appears the first and third week of every month. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the recent recession is far from the dark days of the Depression, when 
movie theaters gave out free dishes to encourage patronage, cruise lines, which 
compete in an ever-expanding market, must come up with fresh ideas to draw new 
passengers -- although nobody's giving out a set of china yet. 
</P>
<P>
 One innovative wrinkle is a time-share plan aboard the posh Seabourn Cruise 
Line, the first such plan to be implemented in the industry, although the 
time-share idea was first promoted in 1979 by a Seattle company which then 
owned the liner United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Seabourn president Larry Pimentel compares the program, called WorldFare, to 
buying a box at the opera or a season ticket for a favorite sports team, except 
that this plan is good for three years and passengers can pre-purchase tickets 
for 45, 60, 90 or 120 days at sea. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the least-expensive WorldFare purchase is 45 days at $29,500 per 
person, the program will mainly attract upscale travelers who have already 
sampled Seabourn's lavish service. The passenger will pay $656 per day on 
WorldFare, compared to an average of $831 per person, double occupancy, per day 
for the standard shipboard suite. 
</P>
<P>
 Pimentel says that although the number of individual WorldFare  
</P>
<P>
 participants is small so far, "we're seeing $100,000 checks coming in" since 
the program began in early April. The per-diem prices get lower as the number 
of participating days goes up, culminating in a 120-day program for $66,500, 
which averages $554 a day per person. 
</P>

 Cunard Line has just started a new Cruise Miles program similar to airline 
frequent flyer plans, the first frequent traveler awards plan for a cruise 
line. Here's how it works: Passengers who sail on any Cunard cruise that 
departs after May 31, 1994, accrue mileage good for future upgrades or free 
cruises. The accrued mileage is good for up to seven years and is awarded on a 
per person, per day accumulation according to ship, lodging category and cruise 
length. Passengers can redeem their awards through travel agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of accrued mileage awards include seven free days aboard a Sea 
Goddess sailing for passengers who book a full world cruise aboard Queen 
Elizabeth 2 or Sagafjord, while passengers who buy an 11-day Sea Goddess 
sailing can cash in those miles for a seven-day cruise on any Cunard Crown 
vessel.

 Nonsmoking passenger cabins and dining rooms, introduced several years ago by 
the Miami-based Majesty Cruise Line, have proliferated, with the newest 
announcements from Carnival Cruise Line and Norwegian Cruise Line. Carnival's 
Los Angeles-based Jubilee and new Sensation, which sails from Miami, have 
banned smoking in all their dining rooms as of mid-May, while NCL has dedicated 
half its fleet to nonsmoking cabins. NCL's casinos will also feature designated 
nonsmoking blackjack tables. On the four NCL ships with more than one 
restaurant (the Norway, Seaward, Windward and Dreamward), an entire dining room 
will be set aside for nonsmokers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Carnival Cruise Line has announced it will begin three- and four-day sailings 
from Los Angeles beginning in spring, 1995, aboard the 1,452-passenger Holiday, 
a sister ship to the Jubilee, which will continue its itinerary of seven-day 
sailings to the Mexican Riviera. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holiday's three-day cruises will depart Friday afternoons and return 
Monday mornings, while the four-day cruises will depart Monday afternoons and 
return Friday mornings. Carnival president Bob Dickinson says the company 
decided to take advantage of the void created when Norwegian Cruise Line 
announced their sale of the Southward, expected to make its last sailing from 
Los Angeles next January. 
</P>

<P>
 Los Angeles-based Princess Cruises announced that it will build the world's 
first 100,000-ton cruise ship, capable of carrying 2,600 passengers, to be 
delivered in 1997. Princess had announced last February that the new ship would 
be in the 90,000-ton class, but revised that estimate in April. In the 
meantime, Carnival announced that it has ordered a 95,000-ton ship for delivery 
in 1996 to carry 3,300 passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous record-holder for passenger ships was Cunard's 83,673-ton Queen 
Elizabeth, launched in 1938 and sunk in Hong Kong Harbor after a fire in 1972. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 NCL is also making an appeal to the growing number of families cruising with 
small children by guaranteeing baby-sitting service between noon and 2 a.m. for 
an hourly fee of $8 for the first child, $1.50 for each sibling, for a 
four-hour minimum. Reservations for sitters can be made on board at least 24 
hours in advance, but may not be booked before embarkation. 
</P>
<P>
 For spa aficionados, Cunard's QE2 will offer complete spa vacations, featuring 
their new two-deck spa, on all transatlantic crossings between July 13 and Oct. 
30. Three different packages are available, each offering massages, seaweed 
wraps, facials, a health and fitness consultation, personalized fitness 
program, spa cuisine and unlimited use of the steam room, sauna and 
thalasso-therapy (seawater therapy) pool. Nutrition, stress reduction and 
behavioral health lectures are also scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Spa packages, available for first-class Columbia dining room passengers only, 
cost an additional $599 per passenger on top of the regular first-class cruise 
fare, which starts at $3,200 per person, double occupancy, including return air 
fare on British Airways.

 A new Walt Disney Co. cruise line headed by Art Rodney, former president of 
Los Angeles-based Crystal Cruises, hopes to introduce the first of two new 
2,400-passenger megaships as early as 1998. Rodney says the first ship will tie 
a three- or four-day cruise into a seven-day package at Walt Disney World in 
Orlando, Fla., and targeted passengers will be families with children, 
honeymooners and seniors. The second ship is expected to be based in Florida, 
Rodney says, with a potential third ship likely to be positioned in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Princess Cruises and Royal Viking Line president Joseph Watters has 
been named as Crystal's new president.

 During a vacation abroad, come 5 p.m., many tourists have exhausted their 
energy reservoirs and retired to their hotel rooms to crash before a night out. 
Pity. That's often precisely the time to be out and about, experiencing the 
community life of a destination.  
</P>
<P>
 Around the world, late afternoon and early evening are a time when, having 
completed the day's work, young and old take to the streets, cafes and plazas 
to exchange greetings with their neighbors, shop for the evening meal or just 
relish the joy of a bracing walk in the open air. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout Spain, for instance, the afternoon parranda is an institution, with 
groups of teens, elders and mothers with baby strollers turning out like 
clockwork to promenade among their peers around the village green. 
</P>
<P>
 In Italy, cafes overflow with couples luxuriating over creamy gelati , while 
in France folks are lined up at boulangeries for crusty baguettes fresh from 
the oven, and Britons are gathered at the local pub for a pint and the latest 
"royals" gossip. 
</P>
<P>
 The beaches of Brazil empty of sunbathers and come alive with young men 
jamming on samba music or battling it out over a volleyball net. And in Bali, 
colorfully attired villagers parade to the local temple, the women balancing on 
their heads steep piles of artfully arranged fruit and pastryofferings. 
</P>
<P>
 For active travelers who may have spent the day scaling a mountain trail or 
tackling a solitary bike route, the hours around dusk are a wonderful 
opportunity to incorporate people into their otherwise often isolated 
activities. A country, after all, is as much about its inhabitants as its 
scenery, and any trip that gives short shrift to the human side really is a 
much diminished experience. Too often, an adventurer's only encounters with the 
host population are interactions with locals hired to haul supplies, cook or 
provide other support labor for an excursion -- which is hardly representative 
of everyday community life. 
</P>
<P>
 During many years of exploring the world's far reaches, my strongest memories 
are not of towering mountains, deep blue seas, or emerald rain forests -- 
though these certainly loom large and pleasantly. What brings back smiles and 
fond reminiscences time and again are the mental images of "people" experiences 
in cities, villages and assorted stops along the way. The same holds true with 
the thousands of travel photographs I've taken. My scenic shots, though often 
dramatic, do not provide nearly as much joy as my pictures of new acquaintances 
on their home turf, who invariably seem delighted to offer a smile and a chunk 
of their time to a visitor interested in more than directions to the nearest 
hotel or tourist draw.

 Meandering up the labyrinth of stone walkways in the northern Italian hill 
town of Todi late one afternoon several years ago, a traveling friend and I 
came upon a trio of senior women sitting on a bench earnestly engaged in 
conversation. My friend, who was short on Italian but long on conviviality, put 
all the words he knew together and launched into a discourse that sent the 
women into gales of laughter. Using mainly hand language, they insisted on 
taking us on a tour of their village, followed by glasses of strong red wine in 
one of their homes. Though we comprehended little of each others' language, we 
all understood the message of friendship implied in attempting to communicate, 
and ended up in goodby embraces and hearty arrivedercis . 
</P>
<P>
 Later I sent the women a copy of the photo I'd snapped of the trio gleefully 
reacting to my friend's fractured Italian. Every time I look at that picture, 
it gives me a laugh and a craving to return to little Todi, and I like to think 
of my three ladies gazing at the photo with similarly warm feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes you have to go a bit off the tourist track to find precious nuggets 
of community life. In southern Spain's Andalusian region late one afternoon we 
were exploring Setenil, one of the less touristed pueblos blancos (white towns) 
-- ancient Moorish villages with whitewashed houses stacked up the hills like 
sugar cubes. Ascending on foot the steep path to the town center, we were 
surprised to find the place all but deserted -- and then we heard what sounded 
like cheering coming from a little hole in a wall that we discerned was the 
village bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the dark entrance way, we discovered dozens of men on rickety wooden 
chairs facing a small TV screen on which a bullfight was being broadcast from 
Madrid. Each time the matador whirled his red cape and the bull snorted by, a 
roar went up among the crowd, followed by much slapping of backs and debate 
about the bullfighter's strengths and weaknesses. It was like Sunday afternoon 
football, Spanish style, and we joined right in, ordering a round of cervezas 
for everyone and cheering along with the rest (though we were secretly rooting 
for the bull). In this stone village with few modern amenities, technology and 
tradition coexisted nicely, and we'd been a happy part of the meld. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 We had another opportunity to savor Spanish tradition the following week in 
Barcelona, where late each Sunday afternoon, much of the city's Catalonian 
population gathers in the courtyard of the cathedral to dance the sardana , a 
centuries-old folk dance performed in large circles, and accompanied by a 
sizable band. Had we taken our afternoon nap, as planned, we would have missed 
this spectacle -- and the wonderful photo we snapped of the sardana dancers in 
full swing. 
</P>
<P>
 Mingling with locals at a restful time of the day is often the best way to get 
a handle on the social and political pulse of a place, a factor of special 
interest to those exploring once out-of-bounds areas only recently opened to 
Westerners. On a cruise up eastern Germany's Elbe River two years after the 
1990 reunification, we stopped in Dresden, which had been transformed from a 
dull gray socialist enclave once favored by the secret police into a colorful 
hub of capitalism with pizza parlors and Baskin-Robbins ice cream trucks. 
</P>
<P>
 Strolling along a narrow street lined with brand new cafes, we fell into 
conversation with a couple from Frankfurt who were devouring a pizza at a small 
table adorned with flowers. They told us all the sprucing up was very nice, but 
they worried that a taste of Western comforts would produce impatience for 
prosperity among the eastern Germans and an unmanageable drain on the western 
German economy. Sure enough, a month later we read of massive strikes in 
Germany over the diversion of money to the east, and rising tensions in the 
east over a perceived lag in advancement.  
</P>

 While especially fruitful encounters often are serendipitous, you can increase 
your chances of experiencing a community at its most interesting by doing a 
little research when you arrive in a town -- often the information is no 
further away than your hotel's front desk.  
</P>
<P>
 Chatting with the reservation's clerk at Amandari, a luxe resort amid the lush 
rice paddies of northern Bali, we were advised to skip the poolside cocktail 
hour and instead venture out to the nearby villages to watch the daily 
pilgrimage to the local temple. We chartered a hotel car and driver for two 
hours, and spent a joyous time navigating from one village to another, pulling 
over to watch the parade of men, women and children bearing tributes of 
flowers, fruits and sweets. In one village, dancers wearing masks representing 
characters from Balinese mythology gyrated and twirled alongside the paraders. 
One dancer slowed down as he approached me, striking a dramatic pose to 
accommodate my raised camera.  
</P>
<P>
 We had planned to spend the night at a cultural show for tourists -- but that 
seemed unnecessary now. Here on this dusty street in a simple village, we were 
witnessing the real thing, minus the artifice of performance schedules, tickets 
and group seating. We lingered until the last of the procession was a distant 
dot and all we could hear was the rhythmic beat of drums fading into the dusk.  
</P>
<P>
 Not a bad trade-off for happy hour, huh? Diving In 
</P>
<P>
 * Before your trip, scan guidebooks for information about traditional daily or 
weekly events in the towns you'll be visiting.  
</P>
<P>
 * When you arrive at your hotel talk to desk clerks and, if there is one, the 
concierge, all of whom are likely to live in the community and be familiar with 
highlights.  
</P>
<P>
 * An easy way to strike up a conversation on the street is to haul out a map 
and ask directions.  
</P>
<P>
 * In a cafe, a good ice-breaker is to indicate to the neighboring table how 
good you think the beer/coffee/wine is. People invariably will notice your 
accent and if they speak any English probably will ask where you're from. With 
that, the conversation usually is off and growing. 
</P>
<P>
 * For insights into cultural etiquette, internationally, pick up a copy of 
"Do's and Taboos Around the World," by Roger Axtell (John Wiley and Sons, 
$12.95).

BACKPACK & BUDGET; WARMING UP TO ICELAND'S PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Iceland -- volcanoes, geysers a capital city heated by bubbling hot springs, a 
lunar-like landscape, a language that echoes Old Icelandic and national 
telephone directory that lists residents by their first names, are all features 
of this offbeat land that travelers will find fascinating. 
</P>
<P>
 But the country is expensive to visit. Fortunately, each summer, temporary 
budget accomodation is made available in facilities such as schools, called 
Edda-Hotels (bring your own sleeping bag), and 27 youth hostels, which prove 
economical lodging and facilities for preparing your own meals. 
</P>
<P>
 One recommended hostel is the Reykjavik Youth Hostel at Sundlaugavey 34, Box 
1045, 121 Reykjavik, Iceland; telephone 011-354-1-38110. Not only does it 
accomodate 104 travelers, but the Icelandic Youth Hostel Assn. has a travel 
desk where you can arrange "do-it-yourself" or group tours. 
</P>
<P>
 This year independent travelers are being offered a Hostelling Around I 
package, which includes a Full-Circle bus pass and seven vouchers for overnight 
accomodation at youth hostels or Edda-Hotels. The pass is valid for travel on 
scheduled bus services in one direction around the 1,097-mile road that circles 
the island. You can make the stops wherever you want. The price is $197. 
</P>
<P>
 A Hostelling Around II package is aso available, which includes an Ominbus 
pass and seven vouchers for youth hostel and sleeping bag accomodations. The 
Omnibus pass allows you to travel in whichever direction you want on the 
long-distance bus services for a set period of time. The package with a 
one-week bus pass costs $356, two weeks is $425, three weeks $512 and four 
weeks $563. 
</P>
<P>
 Packages can be started any day until Aug. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer the price for staying at any of the 27 youth hostels is $17. 
Prepared breakfasts are available for $10 and linen rental (if you don't have 
your own sheet sleeping bag) is $4.50 
</P>
<P>
 Other packages available include day tours from Reykjavik, and walking, bus 
and mountain biking programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Pre-trip information is available from the Iceland Tourists Board, 655 Third 
Ave., New York, N.Y. 10022; tel. (212) 949-2333. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, Iceland became known to budget travelers because of the 
attractive air fares to Luxembourg on the national carrier Icelandair, and 
stopovers were permitted. Now Icelandair flies from a variety of East Coast 
American cities through Reykjavik to different European destinations, but 
Luxembourg is still an option. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxembourg is a independent sovereign state with a population of about 400,000 
which is bordered by Germany, france and Belgium. 
</P>
<P>
 Luxembourg City is known for its fortress with 1,000-year-old history, its 
Grand Ducal Palace, and a network of casemates, or underground bunkers, hewn in 
the rocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Stopover packages for independent travelers visiting Luxembourg City are 
available until the end of September. these include two nights8 dormitory 
accomodation in the youth hostel, breakfasts and dinners, a city map, 
information and vouchers for a city tour, a visit to the casemates of Bock and 
a historic presentation at the fortress. the price is $72.50 
</P>
<P>
 Hikers are offered packages with vouchers for seven nights' accomodation in 
any of the 13 youth hostels in the country, three meals a day and two 
topographical maps. The price is $174. Luxembourg claims to have the densest 
network of trails in the world. The walking paths are maintained by the youth 
hostel association and marked with white triangles. This package is available 
until Oct. 31. 
</P>
<P>
 For details, contact Centrale des Auberges de Jeunesse Luxembourgeoises at 18 
Place d'Armes, B.P. 374, Luxembourg.

HIKING: OLYMPIC NATIONAL PARK: WINDFALL OF BEAUTY ATOP HURRICANE RIDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN McKINNEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mile-high Hurricane Ridge, perched on the northern edge of the Olympic 
Mountains in western Washington, offers postcard panoramas of Olympic National 
Park, as well as the Strait of Juan de Fuca and Vancouver Island. 
</P>
<P>
 Road access to the national park from the north side is limited to just two 
roads, one of which -- Hurricane Ridge Road -- is a scenic gem. The wide road 
begins at Port Angeles and winds around Mt. Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the late 1950's, park administrators had the foresight to close the last 
mile and a half of the road to auto traffic and convert it to a footpath, 
making an easy and inspiring hike. 
</P>
<P>
 Another hike for the heartier, an 8 1/2-mile round-trip ascent of the 
6,454-foot Mt. Angeles, begins from a trail head at the Hurricane Ridge parking 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 The first stop for park visitors and prospective Hurricane Ridge hikers should 
be Pioneer Memorial Museum, Olympic National Park's main interpretive center. 
The museum is located on Hurricane Ridge Road on the outskirt of Port Angeles. 
It is open from 9 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily and is free. 
</P>
<P>
 Directions to trail head: From U.S. 101 in Port Angeles, drive 17 miles up 
Hurricane Ridge Road to the road's end at the Hurricane Ridge parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 The hike: The signed Hurricane Hill Trail ascends through meadowland and 
occasional clusters of subalpine fir. You'll spot some delightful picnic spots 
near the top of the 5,640-foot hill. 
</P>
<P>
 On top, unfold your park map and look for Mt. Constance and Mt Anderson far to 
the southeast, as well as other mighty snow-capped Olympic peaks. Just down 
below, 10 miles to the north, is Port Angeles; 20 miles farther, across the 
Strait of Juan de Fuca, is Victoria, British Columbia. In the blue distance are 
the San Juan Islands. Hurricane Hill Trail 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE: Hurricane Ridge, Olympic National Park. 
</P>
<P>
 DISTANCE: 3 miles round trip with 800-foot elevation gain; longer hikes 
possible. 
</P>
<P>
 TERRAIN: North slope of Olympic Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 HIGHLIGHTS: Alpine wildflowers, grand views of Olympic Range. 
</P>
<P>
 DEGREE OF DIFFICULTY: Easy-moderate.
