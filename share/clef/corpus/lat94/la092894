 NO CLAS: Another one bites the dust -- for now. . . . Just a few years after 
doing away with the California Assessment Program to make way for 
"performance-based" testing of the state's students, the replacement exam is 
being killed. . . . With Gov. Pete Wilson's veto of legislation that would have 
continued the California Learning Assessment System (A1, B1), it's 
back-to-the-drawing-board time for state educators in Sacramento. The CLAS test 
was plagued by controversy almost from the start. 
</P>
<P>
 EDUCATION DEAL: It's a place some may associate more with volume shopping than 
educational discourse. . . . But the Sam's Club in Oxnard will be one of 
hundreds of sites across the country today for a live satellite broadcast from 
the federal Department of Education. Deputy Secretary of Education Madeleine 
Kunin will lead a discussion on school reform, taking questions from parents, 
educators and business leaders. The aim is "to get people excited about these 
issues and stay with them over the long haul," department spokesman John 
McGrath said. 
</P>
<P>
 RUN FOR GLORY: When Nordhoff High School meets Oak Park in nonleague play this 
week, Nordhoff running back Josh Hawkins is expected to keep up his winning 
ways (C6). As tailback, the senior has rushed for 361 yards and four touchdowns 
in Nordhoff's three games so far this season. Said Coach Cliff Farrar: "A lot 
of times a kid with a lot of speed and talent doesn't take it upon himself to 
win every sprint at the end of practice. Josh does." 
</P>
<P>
 BAD TO WORSE: Some things seem to happen earlier every year -- like Christmas 
decorations that go on sale months in advance. . . . Add Ventura County budget 
deliberations to that list. Two months after approving a budget for this fiscal 
year, county officials are already girding themselves for the next round (B1). 
The projected deficit for next year is a dire $43 million, and even that "may 
just be too optimistic," County Auditor-Controller Tom Mahon said.

FAST FEET, FLURRY OF DOLLARS; L.A. MARATHON CASE SHOWS NEED FOR A CLOSER EYE ON 
POLITICAL GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Fair Political Practices Commission and the Los Angeles Ethics 
Commission haven't exactly had kind words for each other lately. And that's 
truly unfortunate, because these two watchdog agencies were created to 
safeguard the public interest by fighting political corruption, not bashing 
each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Bad blood or no, both deserve praise for a joint investigation that has 
yielded a substantial settlement in a case of laundered campaign contributions. 
Under terms of the settlement, Los Angeles Marathon Inc., the firm that 
oversees the annual footrace, must pay a $436,000 fine for improperly funneling 
$73,000 in contributions to state and local candidates through third-party 
organizations and individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 Recipients of the illicit funds include eight current City Council members and 
former L.A. Mayor Tom Bradley. Most of the donations came at a time when L.A. 
Marathon officials were furiously lobbying the City Council for a contract 
extension; later they got one that allows them to hold the race here through 
the year 2000.  
</P>
<P>
 Some elected officials and candidates insist that it's difficult to identify 
the true sources of their campaign contributions. That may be true, but they 
certainly could try harder; we bet they could identify the sources in many 
cases. When an illegal contribution does elude their detection, at the least 
when they learn of the violation they should quickly relinquish the tainted 
money. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Ethics Commission now holds seminars for local candidates and 
their campaign treasurers on campaign finance rules, with a special emphasis on 
fund-raising and campaign contributions. Elected officials should pay attention 
and keep careful notes. In the end, the issue of better identifying campaign 
contributions may have to be addressed through changes in campaign law.

HEALTH WATCH; SLEEPING, NOT DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Health care reform didn't occur this year, and that's a real loss not only for 
President Clinton and Senate Majority Leader George J. Mitchell but also for 
the nation. However, politics is the art of the possible, and health reform 
will return -- in another and probably more palatable form. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans who have been paying attention to news during the last year cannot 
help but be more informed about the key issues of health care reform -- 
expanding access to care, containing costs and maintaining quality. The 
disagreement was not over the goals. It was over how to achieve the goals.  
</P>
<P>
 The various tugs of war proved too much for even Washington: special medical, 
labor and senior citizen interests; Republicans versus Democrats; a largely 
confused set of middle-class voters who didn't want to lose benefits when they 
changed or lost a job but who also didn't want to pay more for that security. 
And even those who were willing to pay more didn't necessarily trust the 
government to change things for the better. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's not hopeless. Sen. Harris Wofford of Pennsylvania has made what we 
think is an apt comparison between Washington's struggle over health care and 
its long legislative struggle over civil rights. Congress in 1957 passed what 
amounted to a fairly toothless civil rights act, then passed another in 1960; 
those paved the way for the landmark Civil Rights Act of 1964. Health care 
reform may take a similar route. And if the result is as positive and 
life-changing for Americans as the 1964 act was, it will be a wait that's worth 
it.

CRACKING DOWN ON THE RIGHT TARGETS; REFORM BEGINS TO TOUCH MINDLESS ROBOCOP 
SENTENCING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It didn't get the attention it should have. Section 80001 of the Violent Crime 
Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, signed by President Clinton this 
month, attracted far less notice than, say, the act's grants for new police 
officers. Yet Section 80001 represents at least a glimmer of hope that the 
increasingly counterproductive rules governing federal felony sentences might 
begin to ease. 
</P>
<P>
 Section 80001 gives federal judges the authority, in limited circumstances, to 
waive the severe mandatory-minimum sentences for low-level, first-time drug 
offenders that have been required by law. Long terms in federal prison for such 
offenders almost certainly do not make for the best use of that expensive 
space. Under 80001, first-time felons in low-level drug cases are eligible for 
lesser sentences if their offenses do not involve the use or threat of violence 
and if they cooperate fully with prosecutors by providing evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 FEAR OF BEING 'SOFT': Yet even these few permissible deviations from the 
indisputably harsh mandatory terms are less than what was originally proposed. 
Earlier versions of the mammoth crime control act would have made those changes 
retroactive, affecting perhaps 5,000 federal prisoners, already doing five to 
10 years for relatively minor drug crimes. More violent criminals should occupy 
this prison space; at the least, retroactivity would have served to reduce 
dangerous overcrowding. Alas, retroactivity was abandoned by members of 
Congress who, despite the legislation's overriding focus on longer sentences, 
new offenses and more police officers, still feared being labeled as soft on 
crime. But the issue isn't about being soft on crime, it's about smart law 
enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Our view is that even relatively minor movement toward greater flexibility 
represents a welcome retrenchment from Congress' decade-long push for 
increasingly long, rigid terms, regardless of the specifics of the case. In the 
1980s, Congress enacted a series of laws that set stratospherically high 
mandatory-minimum prison terms for people convicted of selling or possessing 
narcotics, even if the amounts were small and the circumstances mitigating. 
(Most states, copy-catting, enacted similar provisions.) In general, these 
anti-drug laws do not allow even nonviolent, low-level convicts to be paroled. 
A first-time offender with no history of violence can be -- and some have been 
-- sentenced to life for sale or possession of controlled substances including 
marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Judges have had no discretion under the federal guidelines; they simply look 
up the crime in the sentence tables, add time to the minimum term where 
required for "enhancements" to the crime, such as the use of a firearm, and 
then move on to the next case. Understandably, an increasing number of federal 
judges resent and resist this brainless sentencing scheme: Indeed, about 100 
senior judges now refuse even to hear low-level drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
 PRISONS' NEW LOOK: Cumulatively, this component of the war on drugs has 
radically changed the federal prison population. In 1970 drug offenders made up 
16% of all federal prisoners; now they are 62% of the total. By 1997, the U.S. 
Bureau of Prisons estimates, 70% of federal inmates will be serving time for 
drug crimes. Some federal prisons now house three times the number of people 
they were designed to hold. Nationwide, the system is operating at a 
combustible 40% above capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Section 80001 is only the barest nod toward re-infusing our federal criminal 
justice system with a sense of proportion. For that reason, it should not be 
the last word from Congress or the U.S. Sentencing Commission (established by 
Congress to set the guidelines that judges must apply) on the Hydra-headed 
sentencing monster that has been created. The commission will soon be fully 
staffed for the first time in years. The time for further reform is at hand.

BORIS AND THE BIG FIVE; INTERESTING IF VAGUE IDEAS ON NUCLEAR WEAPONS CONTROL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Creative and intriguing" was the way Madeleine Albright, the U.S. ambassador 
to the United Nations, summed up Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin's proposal 
for a treaty among the five big nuclear powers to reduce their arsenals and 
more tightly control fissionable material. Yes, but what about practical? 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance it's hard to imagine circumstances under which China, Britain 
and France, the other members of the club, would agree to scrap any significant 
portion of their nuclear arsenals. If nothing else, a stockpile of such weapons 
is regarded as affirming a country's claim to be a major player in global 
affairs and so as something to be jealously guarded. But first glances seldom 
provide a full picture. Maybe as the missing details of Yeltsin's idea are 
filled in it will begin to look more feasible. 
</P>
<P>
 The more immediately appealing parts of Yeltsin's proposal, made in an address 
to the U.N. General Assembly, have to do with halting the production of 
material for nuclear weapons and banning the recycling of warhead material from 
dismantled missiles. These at least partially address growing concerns over 
weapons-grade nuclear products being dispersed to countries with secret agendas 
for becoming nuclear powers. Again, Yeltsin offered no specifics. But here 
certainly is an area where the five major nuclear powers should try quickly to 
seek accord, in the interest of a safer world for all of them.

BATTLE ON PELELIU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This is in regard to the Sept. 19 commentary by Del Stelck about the island 
landing on Peleliu. I was on an LCI (M), a mortar boat, supporting Marines in 
occupying the island. For two weeks we dropped thousands of rounds of mortars 
on the island and then without notice, broke off all fighting and went to a 
rear base to refuel, and resupply our mortars and ammo. After we had made the 
Leyte landing, Marines were still fighting on Peleliu and most of us knew 
someone had made a mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latter part of 1945, we removed hundreds of Japanese soldiers. These 
were very well-behaved troops and we found out soon after, the top of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistakes happen. Only history points that out, years later. At the time it 
seemed like a worthwhile project. 
</P>
<P>
 JERRY E. LANE 
</P>
<P>
 La Crescenta 
</P>
<P>
 * The headline of Stelck's article suggests that Americans died in vain. He 
writes that "Japanese troops were still fighting (there) years later." He says 
that "in a decision still difficult to understand, Nimitz ordered the convoy of 
Marines to take Peleliu anyway. Awaiting them were elite Japanese troops that 
could have been bypassed." 
</P>
<P>
 But according to "U.S. Army in World War II," compiled by Mary H. Williams, on 
Nov. 27, 1944, "hostilities on Peleliu end. Approximately 13,600 Japanese have 
been killed on Angaur, Peleliu and small islands off Peleliu . . . 81st (Army) 
Division and attacked units have suffered . . . 542 killed. Reinforced 1st 
Marine Division casualties total about 1,250 killed. . . ." If this is true, 
then more than seven times as many "elite" Japanese troops were killed than 
American troops were killed. 
</P>
<P>
 I question whether these Americans were "slaughtered . . . for no good 
reason." I hope that come Nov. 11 we will also thank and remember all of those 
who fought in the Palaus and are still living.

STATE INDUSTRIAL BASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Your Sept. 14 editorial, "Loss of Hughes: Reality Bites," was a slice of 
reality. Indeed we must fight "door-to-door" to retain threatened industries, 
but let me redefine those doors as our California legislators, academics and 
media outlets.Although California has experienced tremendous bipartisan 
leadership and compromise from a few state and local leaders, their efforts are 
dwarfed by the anti-manufacturing culture in California's social fabric. We 
can't win the battle for high-paying industrial jobs on a company-by-company 
basis but only through a broad-based cultural change that recognizes the social 
and economic value of a strong manufacturing base. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-term relief from thousands of lost jobs goes far beyond defense cuts or 
recessionary excuses. It is the marketplace, driven by consumer demands, that 
is the ultimate force behind our jobless plague. The marketplace sees our 
legislators fighting each other instead of uniting for California programs; it 
sees an education system that ignores industrial arts programs; it shakes its 
head at federal, state and local leaders who don't recognize the importance of 
manufacturing jobs; and stands helplessly at the awesome influence of a biased 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 California is a limitless land of opportunity but our potential is muted if we 
don't come to grips with the strategic value of an economy built on an 
industrial foundation.

GUBERNATORIAL DEBATES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Times reported (Sept. 20) that Gov. Pete Wilson refused to participate in 
a debate with his challenger, Treasurer Kathleen Brown, if questions submitted 
by voters were to be included in those that were to be asked by reporters. The 
Wilson spokesman's reason was that voters did not have enough information to 
formulate questions because people who only vote "don't spend all day every day 
covering the race." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually you need only 60 seconds to master the governor's campaign: 30 
seconds for his television commercial on crime and another half-minute for his 
immigration article. It is unfortunate that Wilson believes that the voters are 
too dumb to ask an intelligent question. We may be smart enough to vote for a 
candidate who does not insult us.

 * The Times has suggested (editorials, Sept. 13, 21) that the League of Women 
Voters organize a gubernatorial debate. 
</P>
<P>
 We acknowledge those groups that have expended time, effort and resources to 
secure debates. It is not our intention to displace them. However, the league 
will immediately step forward as a nonpartisan broker with proposals to resolve 
the stalemate over format and help make the debates a reality. 
</P>
<P>
 The league has been trying to arrange debates in co-sponsorship with other 
state organizations. Experience has taught us, however, since the league 
instituted the first gubernatorial debates in 1978, that the traditional dance 
over details is performed on a constantly shifting floor. Until the candidates 
agree that their obligation to stand before the public in honest debate is more 
important than any personal advantage, this can be one more futile exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 The public has reason to be cynical about the candidates' motives in the 
debate over the debates. We urge both candidates to show their leadership 
qualities and come to an agreement to discuss the issues facing California 
during statewide televised debates.

polls, just in case they feel like flipping a coin. Both candidates have made 
being "against crime" and "for education" the cornerstones of their respective 
campaigns, which is a lot like saying "I'm for goodness and against badness. 
Please vote for me."

HEALTH CARE AND THE FREE MARKET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alain Enthoven and Sara Singer's commentary "Let's Try Aspirin Before We 
Amputate" (Sept. 19) continues to propagate the myth that the U.S. health care 
system is based upon a "free market." A free market implies that the consumer 
has a choice. Our current health care system offers few choices, particularly 
in the midst of a life-threatening emergency. Even for non-emergencies, the 
consumer is restricted by the employer-dictated health plan and by not knowing 
enough about the medical options available, the physicians' or hospitals' 
qualifications, and their fee schedules. Even employers have very little choice 
when selecting a managed care plan for their employees. And, even more 
important, reports on the quality of the various managed care plans are simply 
not available. 
</P>
<P>
 The authors warn that any "anti-managed care" provisions passed by Congress 
could increase the cost of health care by up to 30%. But right now, managed 
care companies are spending 20% to 30% of our premiums in administration and 
profits. What is the use of managed care companies providing "efficient" 
medical care if all the money they save goes into their pockets as 
administrative costs, profits and bonuses for CEOs?  
</P>
<P>
 If the free-market system was applicable to medical care, we should have had 
the best medical care system in the world by now, since we have had "free 
market" for the past 30 years. What we have is the most expensive medical care 
in the world and the system people like the least. 
</P>
<P>
 GEORGE BIXLER MD 
</P>
<P>
 Glendale 
</P>
<P>
 * It is ironic that Enthoven and Singer should write "government-run health 
care is likely to be bureaucratic, wasteful and unable to control costs." It is 
our current insurance company-dominated system, with its huge waste, 
bureaucracy and escalating costs that created our national health care crisis. 
To leave it under insurance company control is ridiculous. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite skepticism over government involvement in anything, its operation of 
Medicare and Social Security has demonstrated far greater administrative 
efficiency than that of the health insurance industry. Also, the single-payer 
systems in Canada, Australia and many other countries have much lower operating 
costs than our system.

 * After reading "Cheaper, Better Health Plan for Federal Employees" (Sept. 
21), I have arrived at an elegant and complete, if not altogether serious, 
answer to the national problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Simply make everyone who votes an employee of the federal government because 
he or she is performing a government service. Non-citizens would be excluded 
because they can't vote, and many, many more citizens would vote.

 I was saddened to read of the death of musician and critic Leonard Feather 
(Sept. 23). He had a discerning ear for the talented rising musician as well as 
an ability to re-evaluate the old pro, and his gift for articulating that 
discernment in his reviews is one of the reasons jazz is treated with more 
respect now than at any time in the past.

 Feather, along with fellow writers Nat Hentoff and the late Ralph J. Gleason, 
(1917-1975), formed a triumvirate of men who, beginning especially in the years 
after World War II, brought a new intelligence to the art of writing about jazz 
music, which showed that jazz was about much more than the drugs and 
smoke-filled dives with which the general public usually associated it.

 * With the passing of the incomparable Leonard Feather, the jazz world has 
lost one of its most durable, brilliant and articulate advocates. I differed 
with him on only two issues -- his adulation of the late Miles Davis, in my 
opinion a mediocre trumpeter who ultimately forswore his jazz roots by dabbling 
in rock 'n' roll; and his apparent animus toward everything pre-Minton's, 
resulting in short shrift to us doddering devotees of Dixieland and 
straight-ahead Big Band jazz. 
</P>
<P>
 Feather's like will not be seen again!

EYEWITNESS: CARLOS FUENTES; PERSPECTIVE ON IMMIGRATION; WHY DAMN A GREAT STATE 
RESOURCE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Mexican author CARLOS FUENTES visited San Diego and Tijuana this week to 
participate in a transborder arts festival. He spoke about the immigration 
issue with Times Staff Writer Sebastian Rotella. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It happened to Jewish communities throughout Europe in the Middle Ages. Or the 
reaction that Hitler fanned in Germany after World War I: You must find a 
scapegoat for the problems you yourself have created and which you do not wish 
to face. It is a cowardly act. It is an inhumane act. 
</P>
<P>
 The deficit and unemployment in California are due to the end of the Cold War, 
the closure of defense industries, the advances in technology. Today, 
productivity breeds unemployment, and we have no solution for that. Plus 12 
years of Reagan and Bush voodoo economics. That is what causes deficit and 
unemployment in California -- not Mexican workers. 
</P>
<P>
 California produces one-third of the agricultural output of the United States; 
90% of that produce is harvested by Mexican hands. Mexico imports $1.2 billion 
a year from California, $2 billion a year from Texas, $4 billion a year from 
the Rust Belt. Thanks to Mexico's imports, the Rust Belt has gone from deficit 
to surplus in trade. And at the same time, the United States helps the economy 
of Mexico in many ways. We depend on each other. 
</P>
<P>
 But if we deform the issues, if we inflame the issues for purely electoral 
reasons, for demagogic reasons, there is going to be a lot of trouble. Mexico 
can retaliate. If Mexico declared a boycott of California goods, this state 
would lose more than $1 billion. And if Mexican workers in California decided 
not to work for one day, for one week, things would come to a standstill. 
</P>
<P>
 I think we should be very cautious about these matters. Gov. (Pete) Wilson is 
poisoning the relationship between the United States and Mexico, which goes 
beyond November, beyond his demagogic electoral agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 And Proposition 187, "save our state," is aberrant in every sense. It is an 
illegal proposition because it goes against the landmark decision of the 
Supreme Court of 1982, which assures that children of immigrants would have 
education. Which means that Gov. Wilson is acting in a purely demagogic way, 
because he surely knows that if the proposition is passed, it will clash with 
jurisprudence in this country and will be immediately enjoined by the courts. 
It is a socially unsound proposition because it forgets that immigrants come to 
this country not searching for welfare or education, but searching for jobs. 
And it is both humanly and politically aberrant because it makes targets of 
schoolchildren and snoops and witch-hunters of teachers and health workers. It 
is going to create a kind of McCarthyite police state of extreme danger. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a very serious matter, it is a very serious moment, and we should be 
looking for real political and social solutions based on the realities of the 
flux of the labor market, both bilateral and international. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a labor problem. It is not a police problem. 
</P>
<P>
 In general terms, the U.S. economy is so mobile, the labor market is so 
mobile, that if you displace workers from one place they will find jobs in 
another place. It is an economy in expansion that permits an absorption of 
immigrants. If the economy in California is not mobile and is not growing and 
cannot absorb immigrants, then something is wrong with the economy of 
California. It has nothing to do with Mexican immigrants. It has to do with 
misrule. It has to do probably with the misrule of Mr. Pete Wilson, personally. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was a U.S. senator, Gov. Wilson pleaded for immigrants to harvest in 
California. Now he has changed his tune because he has found an issue that is 
inflammatory and that will probably make him win the election. I think it is a 
purely electoral ploy, but a very dangerous electoral ploy on the part of a 
demagogic politician. 
</P>
<P>
 Conflict is inevitable unless a kind of political education takes place very 
quickly in the minds of countries that have colonized and exploited and 
plundered the Third World for 500 years and are suddenly absolutely surprised 
that the Third World comes back to them. And even more surprised that this 
should happen in a world of instant communications, flow of capital, 
technological advances. (In such a world) it is inevitable that also there 
should be mobility of the labor market. It is happening, but nobody knows how 
to deal with it, or they do not want to deal with it. These same things are 
happening in Germany against Turks, France against Algerians and in Italy 
against black Africans. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-Mexico border is going to be one of the great hubs of an 
interdependent culture, of a culture for the 21st Century, if we do not drown 
it in blood and intolerance. There is a potential for showing what the New 
World, what America as a continent, is capable of in its historical mission of 
fusion of cultures -- of creating new cultures out of the existing cultures of 
the world. We are a continent of Indians and blacks and Europeans, and not only 
Englishor French or Spanish, but Mediterranean, Jewish, Arab, Greek, Roman. We 
have an extraordinary capacity for this blending, this amalgamation of 
cultures. 
</P>
<P>
 This border is the most exciting border in the world. It is crossed by 200 
million people a year. There is no border like it. I have always said it is a 
scar, not a border. But we don't want the scar to bleed again. We want the scar 
to heal.

ONE PICTURE, TWO PERSPECTIVES; MARION BARRY. LOUIS FARRAKHAN. AL SHARPTON. WHY 
DO BLACKS AND WHITES VIEW THE WORLD SO DIFFERENTLY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN GRIGSBY BATES, Karen Grigsby Bates writes from Los Angeles about 
modern culture, race relations and politics for several national publications. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's two weeks later, and people are still shaking their heads in disbelief: 
"How could they have voted for him?" they ask one another. "How could they, 
after what he did?" 
</P>
<P>
 The he in question is Marion Barry, the once and apparently future mayor of 
Washington. And in case you've forgotten what he did, the media have helpfully 
refreshed everyone's memory with the video clip that cost the mayor his job and 
the taxpayers many thousands of dollars to keep Hizzoner jailed for six months. 
The clip, run frequently in the days preceding and following the primary 
election, yielded an astonishing sight: the then-mayor of Washington smoking 
crack cocaine with a woman not his wife in a local hotel and later being 
arrested by FBI agents in a successful "sting" operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Why the mostly black residents of the district voted for Barry -- including a 
significant chunk of the black bourgeoisie, who were expected to vote for one 
of Barry's two main challengers, both black -- is part of a larger puzzle that 
journalists and others have been trying to piece together since Los Angeles 
blew up two years ago. Why do black and white people view the world so 
differently? Why, with the advent of integrated workplaces, haven't the 
differences between similarly situated blacks and whites been reduced? Why does 
race so drastically affect our interpretations of what seems to be the same 
event? 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another example. Last month, when President Clinton was vacationing on 
Martha's Vineyard, a photograph appeared that neatly encapsulates the 
differences between world views of many blacks and whites. The photo showed 
Clinton and Washington powerbroker Vernon Jordan in a golf cart. Jordan was 
driving, grinning hugely for the cameras, while the President relaxed, feet on 
the dash.  
</P>
<P>
 Many white people saw that photo as an indication of how far we've come in 
race relations. Here is an important black man playing a game once reserved 
only for wealthy white men with the President of the United States, to whom he 
frequently gives counsel. To these people, the photo is a glass half-full; it's 
an indication that racial progress has been made, a sign of hope for the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 But many black people, including extremely mainstream ones, saw it 
differently. "Let me ask you this," deadpanned a black investment banker at a 
blue-chip firm: "How come Vernon got to drive?" The banker was being facetious, 
of course, but the fact that he'd noticed -- despite his own frequent 
appearances on many of the nation's premier golf courses where he is, always, 
the Only One -- said something. It said that some black people looked at the 
Vineyard photo and did not see the black adviser and long-time friend of the 
President being a genial host. (Jordan has, after all, summered on the Vineyard 
for years.) Instead, they saw Jordan playing Rochester to Clinton's Jack Benny, 
Hoke to the President's Mr. Daisy. They were seeing a glass half-empty. (The 
Washington Post reported that several upset black folks called Jordan's office 
to chastise him for assuming the subservient role, which in turn upset Jordan, 
who is definitely a glass-half-full kind of guy. But the complaints must have 
hit home, because when the two played golf the next day, the President drove.) 
</P>
<P>
 One picture, two perspectives. But it is, in many ways, emblematic of why 
black Americans are often enigmas to their white peers. It explains why 
so-called reasonable black people with secure jobs in integrated workplaces 
refused to refute Louis Farrakhan in all his controversial entirety. It 
explains why many non-poor, politically savvy blacks insisted on voting for Al 
Sharpton for senator in the New York primary. ("I know he's going to lose," 
said one woman with a six-figure income. "But I'm angry, and I want them to get 
the message.")  
</P>
<P>
 It explains, via polls that most white journalists find incredible, why many 
black people are unwilling to find O.J. Simpson guilty before he has appeared 
in front of a judge and jury. And it explains why, come November, Barry will be 
back in the saddle again.

'PURE BEAUTY': IRONY BECOMES STALE SECOND TIME AROUND; ART REVIEW: THE MOCA 
EXHIBITION INCLUDES INSTALLATIONS BY SEVEN LOCALS AND THOUGH IT INCLUDES SOME 
TANTALIZING WORK, AS A WHOLE IT CAN BE READ AS ART CONTEMPLATING ITS OWN 
EXTINCTION. 
</P>

<P>
 It's hard to know which is worse, exhibitions that set out to irritate, or 
those that do it accidentally. There is likely a bit of both in "Pure Beauty: 
Some Recent Work From Los Angeles" at the Museum of Contemporary Art. Put 
together by MOCA's Ann Goldstein, it includes installations by seven 
lesser-known locals, and comes here after acting as the inaugural show at Frank 
Gehry's new American Center in Paris. An inauspicious start. 
</P>
<P>
 One glance and you know the title is ironic. It's taken from a 1967 painting 
by John Baldessari, in which he had a sign painter letter the words "Pure 
Beauty" in pedestrian style. The idea was mildly funny at the time but doubled 
ironies eat their own tails. Now it serves to remind us there is no intention 
to address beauty here and, worse, it suggests that this idea-dependent sphere 
of the art world hasn't had a fresh one in decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles' major museums are always tardy in catching up with the indigenous 
art of the moment. When they try they usually get it wrong. Well, what are you 
going to do? There are so many artists around nobody can sort them out. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be a plausible excuse if there weren't a similar demonstration on 
view in town that gets it right, "Plane/Structures" at the Otis Gallery. That 
modest, thoughtful show organized by critic (and Times contributor) David Pagel 
allows its overtly similar art to speak in individual voices about important 
historical, stylistic and expressive matters. The tactic is intelligent 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pure Beauty" is in your face. It's noisy. There are at least a dozen 
television monitors and projectors blaring away. The loudest is a boom box in a 
work by T. Kelly Mason that is presumably about how the aggressive intrusions 
of the media prevent us from thinking. It's tough to see how art that further 
deadens our poor brain is constructive. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, never mind, just endure the electronic assault and save contemplation 
for when you get home and curl up with the catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 No catalogue. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not only insulting to the artists, it ignites the viewers' suspicion 
that, in fact, this show offers nothing to think about. Such ideas as can be 
gleaned are familiar cliches about destroying art to save it, multiculturalism, 
and the virtues of infantile regression in a repressive society. 
</P>
<P>
 Any of these artists might look interesting in another context. For proof, the 
work of Pae White is also in "Plane/Structures," where it is as compelling as 
it is not here. The problem is organizational. In a city whose art is 
fascinating by its variety we have an exhibition that plays to a small coterie 
of like-minded collectors, critics and curators. The last concern of such a 
show is providing accurate insight to art's general audience. Artists are 
snookered into a position where they look like illustrators of someone else's 
text. 
</P>
<P>
 As closely examined as distraction allows, this exhibition does offer some 
tantalizing work. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Hawkins, for example, posits imagery that links the gay aesthetic to a 
fascination with ancient Asia. He presents four elaborate Chinese lanterns 
collaged with snapshots and reproductions of the gorgeous young hunks who, 
since the artist is openly homosexual, fascinate him. Generically they share 
the title "crepuscule" (dusk). He links them to a flamboyant French poet of 
Proust's generation, Comte Robert de Montesquiou, but -- closer to home -- they 
call up Kenneth Anger's underground film masterpiece, "The Inauguration of the 
Pleasure Dome." 
</P>
<P>
 Jorge Pardo and White take another tack on the Asian connection. Where Hawkins 
finds it elaborately exotic, they find a kind of sterility. Their work links 
the rigor of Japanese art to modernism. Both explore the notion of ignoring 
distinctions between art and design. She makes little tableaux of Eames-style 
chairs and modernist influenced design objects. He shows a desk and some 
architectural fragments. Both say that pure beauty is beauty bereft of emotion. 
</P>
<P>
 Thaddeus Strode is not well-served by his surroundings. Taken on his own 
merit, the artist has a wonderful, wall-eyed sense of humor, as in his video, 
"Dancing on Small Change/Double Power (Boardwalking)." Unfortunately, the 
just-closed Bruce Nauman retrospective in adjacent galleries and a recent Mike 
Kelley survey at the County Museum make Strode look like a follower. 
</P>
<P>
 There's an apparent sweetness in Sarah Seager's installation, which consists 
of some 50 framed pieces of correspondence. The earliest, dating from the 
1930s, were written by, or to, one George Watson Cole. They concern his coming 
to grips with his wife's near-fatal bout with pneumonia. He was the original 
owner of the Pasadena house where Seager grew up and the first librarian of the 
Huntington Library, which now also houses the West Coast headquarters of the 
Smithsonian's Archives of American Art. 
</P>
<P>
 Seager writes the archive, attempting to get the Cole correspondence accepted 
as a conceptual artwork. By the time she succeeds we have tumbled to the fact 
that the whole thing was an elaborate Duchampian ruse about the guile and 
manipulation required to make it as an artist today. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the invention of photography, artists have feared becoming obsolete 
at the hands of the mass media. The computer has only made it worse. Diana 
Thater offers two linked video pieces on the subject. One is a room-sized 
projection of bison walking in the snow. Titled "Long Rise Over Snake River," 
it is soundless, fuzzy and mysterious. The companion piece, "Wyoming Algon" 
shows the same video on three normal television monitors, each tuned to one of 
the primary colors. The point is to expose media imagery as an illusion. We 
knew that. All art is an illusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the whole of "Pure Beauty" can be read as art contemplating 
its own extinction. It is not quite clear whether this is the real message or 
an organizational glitch, but the lack of energy and conviction here makes art 
look like it's ready to go. 
</P>
<P>
 That has to be wrong.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'ED WOOD': '50S BLITHE SPIRIT; DIRECTOR TIM BURTON CAPTURES THE 
ECCENTRIC CHARM OF A BAD FILMMAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though most Americans manage to shuffle through their lives without having 
heard of him, to a devoted few (a very few) the name of Edward D. Wood Jr. is 
worthy of veneration. 
</P>
<P>
 A 1950s filmmaker of such unstoppable ineptitude that people who ponder 
extremes consider him the worst director ever ("Glen or Glenda," "Plan 9 From 
Outer Space"), Ed Wood had a strange personality and a startling lack of talent 
that turned him into a cult figure for those fascinated by the outre and 
aberrational. 
</P>
<P>
 There is, for instance, a loving biography called "Nightmare of Ecstasy," 
whose author scorns Wood's critics as "jackals of bourgeois sensibility"; a set 
of 36 trading cards with realistic portraits of him and his cohorts; even a 
video on his life, "Ed Wood: Look Back in Angora," the title referring to the 
director's trademark fetish for women's angora sweaters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The strangest chapter of Wood's singular life, however, is still being 
written. Director Tim Burton, no slouch himself when it comes to the bizarre 
("Beetlejuice" and the "Batman" films), has just spent $25 million to celebrate 
in loving detail the story of a cross-dressing cineaste for whom $25,000 was a 
top-of-the-line budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Even more unexpectedly, the black-and-white "Ed Wood" turns out to be a 
thoroughly entertaining if eccentric piece of business, wacky and amusing in a 
cheerfully preposterous way. Anchored by a tasty, full-throttle performance by 
Martin Landau as Bela Lugosi, "Ed Wood" is a fantasy for the terminally 
disaffected, proof for those who want it that an absense of convention and even 
talent need not be a bar to happiness or immortality. 
</P>
<P>
 An additional component of "Ed Wood's" cracked charm is that it realizes how 
its hero and his beyond-the-fringe cohorts are simply a reduction way past 
absurdity of the classic Hollywood story. As one of the film's executives put 
it, "What if someone had the drive and ego of Orson Welles and none of the 
talent?" What indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 Though the original idea was not his, Burton was captivated by the clever 
Scott Alexander & Larry Karaszewski script. He was especially taken by its 
notion, similar to his own "Edward Scissorhands," that Wood (played by "Edward" 
star Johnny Depp) was an almost holy innocent, an unnaturally optimistic 
Pollyanna who thought that being a director was a wow beyond words. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wow" turns out to be one of Wood's favorite expressions, along with wonderful 
and similar terms of enthusiasm. So what if his play, "The Casual Company," is 
showing to just about nobody as the film opens, or if his actress girlfriend 
Dolores Fuller (Sarah Jessica Parker) keeps wondering why her angora sweaters 
are so stretched out. "We're all doing great work" is Wood's mantra, and he 
sees no reason to let reality change his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 This blithe spiritedness in the face of frequent disasters is the touchstone 
of Wood's character. And though Depp captures the gee-whiz-kid quality of a man 
who smiles winningly while relating that he wore women's underwear as a 
parachuting World War II marine, he is probably too hellaciously cheerful to 
support a feature by himself. That's not necessary, though, because Wood soon 
stumbles upon one of his idols, the great horror actor Bela Lugosi. Trying out 
a coffin. 
</P>
<P>
 No, the star of "Dracula," isn't dead yet, just terminally cranky about being 
forgotten by the business he was once big in. Arrogant, blasphemous (which the 
real Lugosi apparently wasn't) and addicted to morphine with a Demerol chaser, 
Lugosi gives Landau the opportunity for a wonderfully rousing yet poignant 
performance and gives "Ed Wood" the kind of passionate energy Burton films have 
been known to lack. 
</P>
<P>
 The real Lugosi was an opportunity for Wood, too, who used the actor's name to 
help finance skimpily budgeted four-day wonders, a process that "Ed Wood" 
relates in tongue-in-cheek detail. The films range in madness from "Glen or 
Glenda," about a regular guy who (surprise) likes to wear his girlfriend's 
angora sweaters, to the legendarily inept science fiction "Plan 9," which, as 
Wood himself predicts, is "the one I'll be remembered for." 
</P>
<P>
 These films starred more than Lugosi, for Wood had almost a radar for 
has-beens and never-weres wayward enough for Nathanael West. With friends and 
stars like Tor Johnson (George "The Animal" Steele), a professional wrestler 
who could barely grunt English, and Criswell (Jeffrey Jones), a suave psychic 
who specialized in end of the world predictions, it's no wonder that Wood's 
girlfriend Fuller ends up screaming "I need a normal life." 
</P>
<P>
 With these roles and others, including Bill Murray as one of "Plan 9's" stars 
and Patricia Arquette as a more understanding woman, this film has been cast 
with an eye toward physical resemblance. And its beautifully stylized black and 
white look, masterminded by cinematographer Stefan Czapsky, production designer 
Tom Duffield and art director Okowita, has exactly duplicated the details of 
Wood's more celebrated films, though, in an irony he would have appreciated, it 
has cost a whole lot more this time around. 
</P>
<P>
 Undoubtedly a labor of love by a director who had a relationship with Vincent 
Price similar to the one Wood enjoyed with Lugosi, "Ed Wood" is a lot more 
enjoyable than its subject's films and also smoothly avoids dealing with the 
real Wood's unhappy descent into pornography, alcoholism and unrealized 
projects with names like "The Day the Mummies Danced" and "I Awoke Early the 
Day I Died." Wood died at age 54 in 1978, almost completely forgotten, a fate 
this sweet and goofy film insures will never happen again. 
</P>
<P>

film, though transvestism is a major theme. 'Ed Wood'

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ASLEEP AT THE WHEEL TAKES WESTERN SWING FOR A SPIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 "This is what Western swing is all about," Asleep at the Wheel leader Ray 
Benson said Monday night at the Crazy Horse as the band tore into the 
infectious instrumental "Red Wing." 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, the entire 18-song, 90-minute set was what Western swing is all 
about -- even though the material ranged from Bob Wills classics to a Tony 
Bennett ballad ("I Wanna Be Around") and a rock 'n' roll car song ("Hot Rod 
Lincoln"). 
</P>
<P>
 Like Wills, who pioneered Western swing back in the '30s as country music's 
answer to the Big Bands, Benson made sure each selection was subjected to 
plenty of hot, jazz-flavored musicianship and distinctive humor. 
</P>
<P>
 He called on various members of the seven-piece band for solos, most notably 
fiddle player Barbara Lamb (a recent addition to the group), steel guitarist 
Cindy Cashdollar and sax player Mike Francis (especially impressive during 
"Corine Corina"). Benson himself let loose with his share of tasty lead guitar 
and introduced each number with a funny little story or comment. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Selections included "Beat Me Daddy (Eight to the Bar)" and "House of Blue 
Lights" (both of which featured Tim Alexander's pumping piano), "Choo Choo Ch 
Boogie," "Boot Scootin' Boogie," "Miles and Miles of Texas" and "Dance With Who 
Brung You." 
</P>
<P>
 Currently the only lead singer in the band (which has featured something like 
75 members, including Orange County's own Jann Browne, during its 24-year 
career), Benson delivered each song in his characteristically easygoing 
baritone, though he did become positively (and appropriately) manic during "Hot 
Rod Lincoln."

JAZZ REVIEW; THEY CAN'T TAKE GEORGE GERSHWIN AWAY FROM US 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 George Gershwin would have been 96 on Monday -- an occasion observed that 
evening on the sheltered patio of Demario's, a cozy Italian bistro. About 50 
listeners joined bassist/singer Jack Prather and a splendid crew -- singers 
Stephanie Haynes (Mrs. Prather) and Dewey Erney, pianist Jack Reidling and 
drummer Paul Kreibich -- for some real oldies but goodies, the timeless music 
of a genius whose death the Penguin Encyclopedia of Popular Music has called 
"the greatest single loss to music in the U.S. this century." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a real dandy of a show, but then, what isn't when Haynes is aboard? 
(And why is it that this woman -- to these ears one of the top five jazz 
singers on the planet -- lacks a record deal and rarely works the major rooms?) 
</P>
<P>
 Dressed in a red bolero jacket with black lapels, black slacks and shimmering 
circular earrings (the guys all wore tuxedos), Haynes really strutted her 
stuff. "Summertime" was done at a slow simmer, as it should be, with a catchy 
bass part from Prather. Haynes seemed to surround the words with clouds of 
breath and at the end, on the words "with Mommy and Daddy standing by," she 
faded into a whisper, then silence. 
</P>
<P>
 She opened "The Man I Love" with a emotional reading of the verse, then turned 
her husky alto loose on the familiar melody, moving the words around and adding 
blues inflections so things would swing handily -- a Haynes trademark. The 
notes were as bright as midnight on the Las Vegas strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Her tour de force, though, was "I Loves You Porgy" as she pulled out any stops 
she hadn't already, ascending to the top of her range with raw, operatic-like 
power but retaining the emotional qualities that drive the song. 
</P>
<P>
 Erney, another underrated and under-employed vocal ace, sang superbly in a fat 
purr of a tenor that provided a fine complement to Haynes' exuberance. During 
"Somebody Loves Me," he jostled the words, singing them as if he were a 
drummer; he likewise sauntered through "A Foggy Day," stretching some words out 
like rubber bands, chopping others off neatly. 
</P>
<P>
 When he and Haynes got together for "Bess, You Is My Woman Now," his soft, 
breathy notes provided a nice contrast and counter melody to her more dramatic 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pianist Reidling mixed jazz and pizazz enthusiastically with flashy, bubbling 
lines that lit songs up yet left room for the singers. His unaccompanied 
"Rhapsody in Blue," on the electronic Clavinova, was stunning. Playing from 
memory, he was near-flawless, moving seamlessly from one section to another, 
delivering the choice melodies with feeling and the arduous technical passages 
with precision. 
</P>
<P>
 Prather's bass buoyed the singers while Kreibich kept crisp, natty time. Other 
selections included "They Can't Take That Away From Me," "S'Wonderful," 
"Embraceable You" and "Let's Call the Whole Thing Off." 
</P>
<P>
 A libretto by Prather offered tidbits of information -- dates song were 
written, shows they came from, anecdotes -- that further illuminated the joyful 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 * "An Evening of George Gershwin" repeats Monday at Demario's, 17 Monarch Bay 
Plaza (on Pacific Coast Highway at Crown Valley Parkway), Dana Point. 6:30 and 
8:30 p.m. Cover: $6. (714) 240-9436.

 Another Lawsuit: Pop star Michael Jackson was sued for $20 million in U.S. 
District Court in Manhattan Tuesday by the father of two Brazilian youths who 
were allegedly hit by a van leased by Jackson. Attorney John Durst said that 
the two youths, who were 14 and 16 at the time of last October's accident, were 
Jackson fans who had waited to see him outside a toy factory in Sao Paulo. When 
Jackson left the factory, the van in which he was riding struck the boys, Durst 
alleged, with one of them suffering a fractured femur and requiring three 
operations. The suit also alleges that Jackson visited the youths at a hospital 
after the accident and promised to pay their medical expenses, but that the 
family received no compensation and was merely exploited for public relations 
purposes. A Jackson spokesman was unavailable for comment.

 Barker Suit Update: A Los Angeles judge on Tuesday dismissed some portions of 
former "The Price Is Right" model Dian Parkinson's $8-million lawsuit against 
game-show host Bob Barker and others, but left intact the suit's main 
allegations of sexual harassment and employment discrimination. Parkinson had 
sued Barker, Mark Goodson Productions Inc. and several of the show's executives 
in June, alleging that Barker repeatedly coerced her into having sex with him 
between 1989 and 1993. Superior Judge Edward Ross dismissed show executive 
Jonathan Goodson from the lawsuit, ruling that he was unaware of the alleged 
situation. Ross also dismissed allegations that the show's producers conspired 
against Parkinson, and said he will dismiss allegations that Barker conspired 
against Parkinson and violated her civil rights, unless her lawyers can bolster 
their charges within 30 days. Barker admits having a fling with Parkinson, but 
says it was consensual.

 Burt Vs. Loni Again?: Attorneys for Burt Reynolds said Tuesday they will file 
a civil damage lawsuit today against Loni Anderson, the actor's ex-wife. The 
attorneys provided few details, except to say that the suit would be connected 
to the two actors' divorce settlement, and concerned their son. Reynolds and 
Anderson filed for divorce in Florida in June 1993. TELEVISION

 Stage Theft: A 48-foot truck-trailer carrying a set for Verdi's "Aida" from 
San Francisco to Opera Pacific in Orange County was stolen from a parking lot 
in Ontario sometime Saturday night. The show, scheduled to open this weekend at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa, will go on, according 
to company officials who are trying to obtain scenery from other opera 
companies and have already made some changes in their staging. Opera Pacific is 
asking the public to call Interstate Consolidation at (213) 720-1771 with any 
information. The cab has Oregon license plate YABW949 and the trailer has 
Oregon license plate HP40153. There is a $2,500 reward for the set's return.

 New Arts Center: A parade of 400 children marching through the streets of Skid 
Row will mark today's opening of the $2.5-million Mark Taper Center/Inner-City 
Arts, which will provide 4,300 inner-city children with arts education, both 
during the school day and as part of a latch-key program. Mayor Richard Riordan 
will preside over the center's 11 a.m. opening ceremonies, which will also 
feature the comedy trio Culture Clash, Laker forward George Lynch and a 
Brazilian percussion band. The new 16,000-square-foot center -- which features 
individual studios for drama/dance, music, language arts, visual arts and media 
arts, as well as a separate ceramics building and an outdoor courtyard -- is 
located at 720 S. Kohler St. The arts program had been operating out of 
temporary trailers at the 9th Street School.

 One Hurdle Remains: The House on Tuesday once again approved a $168-million 
1995 budget for the National Endowment for the Arts, a 2% cut from this year's 
funding. The NEA budget, part of the $13.6-billion Interior Department bill, 
had received previous approval from the House, but went to a House-Senate 
conference committee last week after the Senate had voted for a deeper, 5% cut 
targeted toward controversial visual arts and performance programs. The 
conference committee threw out the Senate's proposal, and sent the House's 
version back to both houses. Senate approval is still needed for the 
$168-million budget, which is for the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1. SHAUNA SNOW

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ROMANCE WORKS FOR ROGERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DENNIS HUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It made sense when Natalie Cole, Sheena Easton and even Robert Palmer followed 
Linda Ronstadt as contemporary singers doing dramatic about-faces and making 
albums of pre-1950 romantic standards. But Kenny Rogers? 
</P>
<P>
 A certain sophistication, a sense that you belong in the champagne-and-caviar 
set, is needed to make this stylistic switch work. But Rogers, who premiered 
his "new" style at the House of Blues on Monday, is an easygoing, earthy, 
grandfatherly, pop-country singer who suggests beer and pretzels. 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, though, it clicked. 
</P>
<P>
 It took a few songs to get used to the new Rogers, who didn't look all that 
comfortable decked out in a dinner jacket. To enhance his image change, the 
down-home look of the House of Blues was shifted to a swanky, supper-club 
atmosphere for this show, which was being taped for a TV special. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by an excellent orchestra with first-rate arrangements, Rogers very 
capably crooned the likes of "I Remember You" and "When I Fall in Love," 
smoothing the edges of his brusque country style and sweetening his tone. 
Rather than try for the classic silky approach of a Johnny Mathis, Rogers 
wisely settled on the somewhat clipped, warm, lived-in style of Willie Nelson, 
who's also noted for singing standards. 
</P>
<P>
 It was basically a lively, enjoyable show, with Rogers showcasing material 
from his new album, "Timepiece." He mostly sang dreamy romantic ballads and 
stayed away from his own hits -- with the exception of a nifty, swinging 
version of "The Gambler." The soul-gospel vocal group Take 6, which appears on 
the album version of "Love Is Just Around the Corner," dazzled in a guest 
performance on that tune. DENNIS HUNT

MOVIE REVIEW; AMBITIOUS 'JASON'S LYRIC' FALLS SHORT OF REDEMPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Jason's Lyric" is a terribly earnest melodrama with king-size ambitions. Set 
in the inner cities of Houston, it bulges with biblical pretension. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua (Bokeem Woodbine) and Jason (Allen Payne) are the Cain and Abel of the 
piece. We first see them in flashback as two carefree lads romping in the 
fields with their doting dad (Forest Whitaker). But that was before he was 
shattered and deranged by Vietnam. In an in-your-face sequence that has more 
power than anything else in the movie, the father breaks into the family home 
and attacks his wife (Suzzanne Douglas) and is then shot by one of his young 
sons. 
</P>
<P>
 The memories and guilt surrounding this event have gnarled the boys' lives. 
Joshua has spent time in prison; Jason, while seemingly hard-working and 
law-abiding, is plagued by nightmares. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Doug McHenry and screenwriter Bobby Smith Jr. frame the story as a 
redemptive fantasy. Jason, who turns down an out-of-town job promotion because 
it would leave his mother living alone with Josh, finds his dream woman in the 
form of Lyric (Jada Pinkett), who works in a soul food restaurant and plays 
extremely hard-to-get. She has seen too many boyfriends gunned down -- her 
half-brother ("Naughty by Nature's" Treach) is a local gangsta -- and she 
doesn't want any more pain. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Jason woos her and wins, and their communions are alternately 
pastoral (lots of soft-focus, outdoorsy, smell-the-roses stuff) and heavy-duty 
(graphic couplings that seem inserted to boost the film's commercial 
temperature). The notion that two good-hearted soul mates could thrive in this 
jungle is, no doubt, important to the film's polemic. But the lovey-dovey 
material doesn't have much substance; neither does the criminal sequences 
involving Josh, who is so perpetually out of control that it's a miracle he's 
able to make it through a day without getting offed. 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmakers attempt to temper the good son/bad son plot by making each boy 
a variation of the other: Jason is supposed to internalize Josh's rage. But 
Jason is too bland to sustain the comparison, and Josh doesn't transcend his 
scary trappings. The film seems overextended and unbelievable both as love 
story and as urban tragedy. There are a few good scenes, such as the birthday 
homecoming of a drunken Josh, or the sassy-sincere interplay between Lyric and 
her co-worker/buddy (Lisa Carson). But most of "Jason's Lyric" tries to force 
its cooked-up sensitivities on us. Greatness is more hard-won than this. 
</P>
<P>

MUSIC REVIEW; POET WILLIAM BLAKE FOCUS OF SOUTHWEST CHAMBER'S OPENER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIMOTHY MANGAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southwest Chamber Music Society opened its eighth season Monday night with 
what, for this organization, has become a characteristic event: an 
intelligently chosen, exploratory program, solidly performed. 
</P>
<P>
 The other good news was the venue itself. The Huntington Library in San 
Marino, which hasn't served, at least in recent memory, as a major concert 
site, proved again an exceptional location for chamber music. Parked in front 
of Gainsborough's "The Blue Boy," the Southwest ensembles presented a resonant, 
balanced and detailed sound. 
</P>
<P>
 Offered in conjunction with the Library's exhibition of William Blake's 
illuminated prints, the program attempted musical cross-references with late 
Beethoven, devotional Haydn, and music by Benjamin Britten using the poetry of 
Blake. 
</P>
<P>
 Tenor Jonathan Mack was the communicative soloist in Britten's "Songs and 
Proverbs of William Blake," a wonderfully clear distillation of the poet's 
mysticism, wisdom and dark views. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the short proverbs as transitions between songs -- as hovering moments 
of insight they are rendered in a shimmering, 12-note swirl -- and capturing 
the spirit of the songs in remarkably immediate but evocative terms, Britten's 
1965 cycle offers a compelling half-hour of words and music. Mack gave it a 
fluid, unaffected and forceful reading, with Susan Svrcek, on a clunky Yamaha 
grand, in integral backup. 
</P>
<P>
 The post-intermission proceedings might have been dreamed up as a sort of 
comic stereotype of all that is to be dreaded in a chamber-music concert: Eight 
slow movements, 48 minutes, of string quartet music, heard from hard chairs, in 
a museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Haydn's "Seven Last Words of Christ on the Cross" is (and was), of course, 
much easier to take than that implies, being mostly simple, songful music 
alternating with straightforward dramatic outpourings. And the Southwest 
Quartet -- Peter Marsh and Annie Chalex, violins, Jan Karlin, viola, and Roger 
Lebow, cello -- gave it a polished, sonorous, flowing and intense performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert began with Beethoven's last string quartet, Opus 135, with the 
same players in a slightly less finished but no less purposeful reading.

AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAM TAKES OFF AT LEMONWOOD; OXNARD: CHILDREN REMAIN ON CAMPUS 
FOR HOMEWORK OR PLAY. ORGANIZERS HAD WORRIED THAT UNSUPERVISED YOUNGSTERS WERE 
AT RISK OF GETTING INTO TROUBLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In the large cafeteria at Oxnard's Lemonwood School, 10 or so children 
squealed as they played table soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We won again," an excited Maria Mendez shouted as she pulled the handrails of 
the soccer table. 
</P>
<P>
 In another corner, 34-year-old Rosa Villa told fifth-grader Veronica Arenas 
that she needed to shorten the sentences in her homework. "OK, read it now and 
let's hear how it sounds," Villa said. "You need to write short sentences; 
otherwise they don't sound right." 
</P>
<P>
 Villa is one of several Oxnard residents who have developed a pilot program to 
allow children ages 6 to 12 to remain at school for supervised play or homework 
until 5:30 p.m. Mondays through Fridays. 
</P>
<P>
 The project allows children attending or living near Lemonwood School in north 
Oxnard to remain there until their parents get home. 
</P>
<P>
 The program, which began Monday, is the result of a yearlong effort by County 
Supervisor John K. Flynn, business owners and residents who worry that 
unsupervised children are at risk of joining gangs and getting into other kinds 
of trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are thrilled that we finally have the program going," Flynn said. "The 
parents are excited, the children are excited and we are excited because this 
is the only way to keep our kids away from street trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Administered by the Boys & Girls Club of Oxnard, the program requires that 
parents fill out a form that automatically makes the child a member of the 
club. 
</P>
<P>
 As of Tuesday, more than 100 children had registered for the free program, 
said Villa, program director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not going to say no to anyone," she said. "We hope every child in the 
school will be able to participate." 
</P>
<P>
 But Villa said it is impossible to have all 770 children at Lemonwood attend 
the program on a given day. She does not expect the same group of children 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some parents work part time, so the days when they don't work, they probably 
will have their children home," Villa said. 
</P>
<P>
 When classes end at 2:30 p.m., the children gather at the school cafeteria and 
do homework for the next hour. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As they solve math problems and write essays, they are assisted by two senior 
citizens, two Oxnard College students, two high school students and Villa, a 
Boys & Girls Club employee. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior citizens and high school students are not paid, but the college 
students receive hourly pay from the program and their school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It warms my heart to see them wanting to learn," said 81-year old Helen 
Kelly, a retired teacher and now a volunteer. "They are so zesty, full of 
energy. It's exciting to watch them." 
</P>
<P>
 After they finish their homework, the children eat donated snacks, then may 
play Ping-Pong, chess, cards, Monopoly and other games. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters who enjoy sports can go to the playground, just outside the 
cafeteria, for football, soccer and other games.

<P>
 "I love it here," 9-year-old Veronica Arenas said. "If I went home, I would 
watch TV and be bored." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Like many other children at Lemonwood, Veronica and her 8-year-old brother 
normally stay with relatives and wait for their mother to get home from work 
about 6 p.m., Veronica said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's much more fun to stay here and play with my friends," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Flynn said he and the group of citywide volunteers who developed the program 
picked Lemonwood because many parents in the area had sought help in preventing 
youngsters from joining gangs. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the program was first envisioned in June, 1993, during a community 
meeting televised from the Boys & Girls Club in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Soliciting businesses and nonprofit groups for help, organizers raised 
$27,000, enough to implement the same program at Driffill School in Oxnard by 
the end of October. 
</P>
<P>
 "The magic was to see people going out of their way so they could bring forth 
that same magic to the lives of so many children in our city," said Richard 
Figueroa, an Oxnard physician who helped develop the program. 
</P>
<P>
 Figueroa, who grew up in Oxnard, said he wants to give back to the community 
what he received. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a child, I was fortunate to grow up during a time when life was simple and 
schools provided after-school programs," he said. "It's been disheartening to 
see all those activities for children dwindle through the years."

SCHOOL'S NEIGHBORS PETITION FOR SAFER STREETS; VENTURA: THE DEATH OF A 
12-YEAR-OLD NEAR JUANAMARIA ELEMENTARY PROMPTS THE ACTION. TRAFFIC ENGINEERS TO 
INVESTIGATE THE CONCERNS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Prompted by a child's death in a bicycling accident last week, more than 300 
Ventura residents have signed a petition to make the streets safer around the 
eastside's Juanamaria Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are not slowing down for the kids," said Billie Olmstead, the eastside 
resident who started the signature drive. "(Drivers) are just very reckless as 
far as I'm concerned." 
</P>
<P>
 Olmstead said she has tried for years to get the city's attention about the 
speeding problems around the elementary school on Telegraph Road between Petit 
Avenue and Kimball Road. She first noticed how fast people drove when she 
walked her grandchildren to the Juanamaria School in the mornings. 
</P>
<P>
 But she said council members did not return her calls and city staff, though 
available, proved of little help. 
</P>
<P>
 Then last Wednesday, 12-year-old Christopher Grasmugg died in a bicycling 
accident unrelated to the area's speeding problems. Pedaling home from Balboa 
Middle School in the early evening, he swerved into a passing car on Blackburn 
Road, just south of Juanamaria Elementary School, and suffered fatal head 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Olmstead said she knows that fast driving had nothing to do with Christopher's 
death. But the traffic accident occurred near Juanamaria and it involved a 
child who once attended the school, so she decided to seize on it as her 
opportunity to call the City Council's attention to what she considers a 
growing problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought how can I get the council members' attention?" she said. "I'll get 
it this way. Also, it's an election year." 
</P>
<P>
 Olmstead's hunch proved correct. After listening to her concerns Monday night, 
the council ordered the city's traffic engineers to investigate the petition's 
demand for a traffic light at Petit Avenue and Telegraph Road, and for a stop 
sign at Petit Avenue where it crosses Balboa Street. 
</P>
<P>
 On council orders, the engineers will also re-examine the posted speed limits 
on the streets surrounding Juanamaria Elementary School. Those speed limits 
range from 50 to 25 m.p.h. In addition, the council's traffic committee will 
soon discuss a citywide survey of traffic problems at all Ventura schools and 
nearby roads. 
</P>
<P>
 However, since the city's traffic engineers are just concluding a survey of 
all Ventura's intersections, council members say they are not sure how much 
more work they need to do.  
</P>
<P>
 But school officials and parents say the idea is so attractive they would like 
the city to start on it as soon as possible.  
</P>
<P>
 "That would be great," said Paul Jablonowski, principal of Lincoln Elementary 
School on Santa Clara Street in downtown Ventura. "It can get pretty hairy here 
at times." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who live and work around the Juanamaria school in particular are 
frustrated by the traffic zooming daily down their residential streets. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are flying right by," griped Jean Peckfelder, who lives on Santa Maria 
Street. "I have three children that love to play street hockey on our street, 
and the cars are going 40 m.p.h. down our street alone." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Patrick Azarian, who attends Juanamaria, said the speeding 
vehicles scare him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I worry that the drivers go too fast," he said, walking home from school 
Tuesday with his two brothers, a friend, and a baby-sitter. "I think it's not 
very good to go fast. You might hit someone riding a bike and cause very 
serious injuries." 
</P>
<P>
 Patrick said he does his best to practice safety precautions. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always look both ways, and if there's a car we go like this," he said, 
demonstrating how he steps back from the street onto the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 "But some cars come faster than we run," he added. "We don't like that."

GROUNDBREAKING ON SIMI VALLEY BOYS & GIRLS CLUB MAY START THIS YEAR; 
RECREATION: PANEL URGES THE CITY COUNCIL TO APPROVE THE LONG-DELAYED 
$3.3-MILLION PROJECT IN OCTOBER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Groundbreaking on a new home for the Boys & Girls Club of Simi Valley may 
happen as early as Christmas after initial city approval of the $3.3-million 
project this week. 
</P>
<P>
 A City Council subcommittee that reviewed the club's financial plan Monday 
evening recommended that the council approve the long-delayed project in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hoping to approve putting out construction bids at the same time," said 
Mayor Greg Stratton, also a member of the subcommittee. "Do it all in one fell 
swoop. I've been looking forward to this for a long time. This is a major 
happiness." 
</P>
<P>
 The project, initially slated for construction in 1992, has been held up by a 
dispute with CPC Enterprises, owner of adjacent property on Kadota Street. 
</P>
<P>
 CPC Enterprises called for an environmental review of the project, saying the 
club would block tenants' mountain views in its Park Plaza office complex. When 
the city approved the project without an environmental review, CPC Enterprises 
filed suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit wound up before the state Supreme Court. But the court in May 
declined to hear it, opening the door for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 The club is now in an old elementary school building. It has a membership of 
about 2,000. About 150 children participate in after-school programs daily, 
according to club President Tim Shannon. During summers, 250 children crowd 
into the small building each day. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jan. 17 earthquake knocked out one of the main rooms in the school 
building, Stratton said, forcing the Boys & Girls Club into an even smaller 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been squished and they have been squashed into part of that 
school," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon said the new 25,000-square-foot club, which will include an arts and 
crafts room, a gymnasium and multipurpose rooms, will allow for more programs 
for teen-agers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to become much more aggressive with our teen programming," Shannon 
said. "The major reason we haven't is lack of space. When we do get into that 
new building we will become very aggressive." 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley will own the building and pay all of its $3.3-million price tag. 
But the club will pay $1.5 million to the city during a long-term lease. 
</P>
<P>
 Original plans called for the club to pay off the lease in 45 years, but the 
club now hopes to pay it off in only eight years. 
</P>
<P>
 Shannon said the club will soon begin a major fund-raising campaign to clear 
the obligation as early as possible.

SUPERVISORS TO GET A JUMP ON NEXT BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PHYLLIS W. JORDAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With budget deliberations barely two months behind them and a projected 
$43-million deficit looming ahead, Ventura County supervisors agreed Tuesday to 
start planning now how to balance next year's budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "Quite frankly, it's been said these projections are too conservative. But 
these projections may just be too optimistic," county Auditor-Controller Tom 
Mahon told the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County can expect to lose more state funding, pay more into its 
retirement accounts and continue spending millions more than it receives, Mahon 
warned the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Without some changes, he predicted, revenues would fall $43 million short of 
expenditures in the budget year beginning next July. The current budget is $880 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors agreed to set up a staff committee to study the problem and report 
back early in November. The board would receive reports throughout the year, 
rather than concentrating its efforts in the weeks before budget approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the main intents is to get started early," Supervisor John K. Flynn 
said. "No matter how you paint it, the situation is getting worse. We don't 
know what the state is going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 But county employees, who have been hit hard by five successive years of 
budget cuts, say Mahon's approach to budgeting is unduly conservative, yielding 
huge reserve funds while slashing public services. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your goal is to amass large amounts of cash, then his assumptions are 
working," said Barry Hammitt, executive director for the Service Employees 
International Union, Local 998. "But if your goal is to provide services to the 
citizens of Ventura County, then you're missing the mark." 
</P>
<P>
 The union went so far this summer as to hire an accounting firm, which 
concluded that county analysts consistently overestimate expenses and end each 
year with leftover funds. What's more, the county has $44.6 million sitting in 
a workers' compensation fund -- an account most large counties keep at about $7 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors took $1 million out of that account and eliminated 59 jobs and 
some services to balance the current year's budget, but appear reluctant to dip 
further into reserve funds. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should be spending down all of our reserves," Supervisor 
Maggie Kildee said. "I don't believe we've seen the worst of times yet." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Kildee and other supervisors believe that the $11 million in state 
reductions they faced over the summer were mild compared to what lies ahead. 
With statewide elections behind them, lawmakers are expected to cut deeper into 
the county and city accounts in the coming year. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as we deal in a prudent manner, there's no reason that the county of 
Ventura can't live with whatever they throw at us," Mahon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the state reductions, new actuarial calculations for retired county 
employees indicate that the county needs to be investing more in its retirement 
funds. That could cost the county $5.8 million extra in next year's budget, 
Mahon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even without these changes, the county simply is not taking in the revenue it 
needs to pay continuing salary increases and maintenance costs, he said. 
Through the 1980s, the county's shortfall -- the difference between revenue and 
the cost of maintaining services -- averaged $7.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992 it climbed to $9.6 million and in 1993 it was $15.4 million. In July's 
budget deliberations, supervisors faced a $35.8-million shortfall, according to 
Mahon's figures. 
</P>
<P>
 To change that trend, supervisors need to restructure county government -- 
eliminating entire programs and changing the way services are delivered, Chief 
Administrative Officer Richard Wittenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff panel will study restructuring efforts and return to supervisors for 
direction, he said.

REJECTION OF CLAS TESTS IS CHEERED, CRITICIZED; EDUCATION: SOME IN COUNTY CALL 
GOVERNOR'S VETO 'A GREAT VICTORY FOR PARENTS.' OTHERS CALL IT A LOSS FOR 
STUDENTS AND TEACHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson's veto Tuesday of California's hotly debated student 
assessment system spread cheer among Ventura County residents who fought 
against the test and a sense of defeat among supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm tickled to death," said Mildred Lynch, a Conejo Valley school board 
member and former English teacher who testified before state legislators in 
opposition to the California Learning Assessment System. The rejection of the 
exam was "a great victory for parents because it was a grass-roots effort," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some county teachers, parents and school administrators called Wilson's 
action a loss for students and teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were hoping a lot of the difficulties could be worked out and we would 
have a significant assessment tool," said Linda Valdez, English department 
chairwoman at Camarillo High School, where students surpassed the county 
average on the 1992 CLAS test. "Now that's not going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson vetoed legislation that would have continued CLAS for five years. His 
action came after state officials' failure to agree on what sort of skills the 
test should measure and Wilson's insistence that CLAS yield scores for 
individual students in addition to schools and districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm jubilant," said Coleen Ary, a Simi Valley parent who heads a conservative 
group, Citizens for Truth in Education, that opposed CLAS. "This was a bad test 
administered by a bad State Board of Education done with bad planning. There 
wasn't anything good about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Developed over the past several years and first given to students statewide in 
1992, CLAS marked a sharp departure from traditional assessment exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Through separate tests in math, reading, writing and social science, CLAS 
asked students not only to answer questions but to explain their responses in 
writing. 
</P>
<P>
 Furor initially arose over the exam's reading and writing sections, which 
included literary excerpts -- such as one from Richard Wright's acclaimed 
autobiography "Black Boy" -- that opponents said were too violent and 
disturbing for young students. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also argued that the test failed to emphasize basic skills such as 
spelling and arithmetic and that it invaded students' privacy by asking them to 
compare the experiences of literary characters to their own lives. 
</P>
<P>
 And CLAS was expensive, partly because of how it was scored. 
</P>
<P>
 While computers are able to scan the answer sheets of standardized 
multiple-choice tests, the state had to hire a cadre of teachers to read and 
score the essay-type questions on CLAS. California has spent $50 million 
developing and administering the exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura parent Geri Fortner said Wilson was right not to try to salvage CLAS 
because the exam was fundamentally flawed. It cost too much money, she said, 
and the scoring of its essay-type questions was too subjective. "They started 
with something that wasn't good to begin with," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But CLAS supporters said the exam marked a revolutionary change in testing 
that has served as a model nationwide. Rather than throwing out the exam, they 
said, the state should have continued to refine it. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like throwing the baby out with the bathwater," Simi Valley school board 
member Debbie Sandland said. "This is really unfortunate." 
</P>
<P>
 Some educators who supported CLAS said they believe Wilson's veto had less to 
do with education than politics because the governor wants the votes of CLAS 
opponents in the November election. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very shortsighted, and I think it's political," said Bob Pease, English 
department chairman at Buena High School in Ventura. CLAS, he said, "was aimed 
at . . . making teaching more effective." 
</P>
<P>
 By testing students on critical-thinking skills and problem-solving abilities, 
supporters said, CLAS encouraged teachers to focus on these areas in the 
classroom. 
</P>
<P>
 But CLAS' fatal flaw, some educators said, was that it was crafted with too 
little assistance from the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "My view is that the CLAS test started out with inadequate teacher and 
community input and in many ways it was doomed from the start," said Jerry 
Gross, superintendent for the Conejo Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ventura parent Kay Sredl said she believes some CLAS opponents felt 
threatened because the exam was so unfamiliar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think some of the resistance is that these tests are different than what 
everybody was accustomed to," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers had planned to give CLAS exams again this spring. But Wilson's 
decision leaves schools in Ventura County and around California without any 
statewide assessment test for the first time in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Diana Rigby, a curriculum director for the county superintendent of schools, 
said she believes the governor's decision to veto CLAS was political. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether the exam will survive his action, she said, may depend in part on who 
is elected this November as state superintendent of public instruction. Of the 
leading contenders, Delaine Easton supports CLAS, and Maureen DiMarco, Wilson's 
education adviser, opposes the exam. 
</P>
<P>
 At any rate, Rigby said, state officials probably will propose another 
assessment system that will include some features of CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think what you'll see is a mixture," Rigby said. "You'll see some 
open-ended questions, such as on CLAS. You'll see some multiple-choice."

VENTURA SEEKS TO SELL WATER SHARE IN PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ventura city officials filled out order forms Tuesday for 3.26 billion gallons 
of Northern California water, hoping to sell it to another city and recoup some 
of Ventura's yearly payment to the state water system. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has owned the rights to the water carried via the state's central 
aqueduct for 31 years. But it has never actually ordered its allotted share of 
water because the city has no pipeline to the aqueduct. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials hope to reclaim a portion of the $800,000 that the city pays 
yearly for rights to the 10,000 acre-feet of water by paying yet more money for 
delivery of the water, then selling it to a user who can obtain the water. The 
City Council voted 5 to 0 at Monday's meeting to order the water, the first 
step toward selling it. 
</P>
<P>
 But state Department of Water Resources officials said it is far from certain 
they would allow Ventura to sell its share of water. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've ordinarily not permitted transfers of 'paper water,' " said David N. 
Kennedy, director of the Department of Water Resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said he will decide by December whether to allow the lease deal to go 
forward, after consulting with all 29 agencies that contract with the state for 
water. He said he was unfamiliar with the details of the plan, and that 
approval will depend on how those details affect other water consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Metropolitan Water District, which serves Los Angeles and 
is by far the largest of the 29 state water contractors, said Tuesday the 
agency would not oppose the lease deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they can find a willing buyer, that is consistent with Met's thought that 
the free marketing of California water ought to be as unfettered as possible," 
district spokesman Jay Malinowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 State water officials were less enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a water-short project," said Dan Flory, chief of the state Water Branch 
Contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 If each agency requested all the water it was entitled to, Flory said, the 
demand of more than 4 million acre-feet a year would far exceed the supply, 
which varies according to the rainfall. In 1993, the supply was 2.3 million 
acre-feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura plans to request 10,000 acre-feet from the State Water Project. There 
are 326,000 gallons in one acre-foot, enough to supply two average-size 
families for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura is not the only local State Water Project member to consider cashing 
in on long-held water rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The Casitas Water District board of directors is expected to vote today to 
order the 5,000 acre-feet it is entitled to, with an eye toward joining with 
the city of Ventura to lease the 15,000 acre-feet to a single user. 
</P>
<P>
 John Johnson, general manager of the Casitas Water District, said he was 
unconcerned over a statewide increase in water demand because of orders from 
agencies seeking to lease their water entitlements. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't it be nice to have a run on water? Then we could raise the prices," 
Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, Johnson said, is that Casitas has been paying $400,000 a year 
for the water, and its 60,000 ratepayers in Ojai and western Ventura are 
entitled to the water or the money from its sale. Johnson refused to identify 
prospective buyers of the water. 
</P>
<P>
 The effect of a lease deal would be to change "paper water" into real water, 
said Steve Macaulay, general manager of the Assn. of State Water Contractors. 
"That has the effect of increasing the hard demand for water," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City officials dismissed to worries over statewide supply and demand. "We've 
always made it a point to pay them with real money," said Henry Graumlich, 
administrative assistant in the Ventura Public Works Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Mayor Tom Buford said a lease deal would save the city money while 
allowing it to maintain the option to use state water for its own needs in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 If the city is unable to find a buyer for the water, it can cancel its order 
by April 30 and get back the extra money it would have to pay for delivery of 
the water, Graumlich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Macaulay of the State Water Contractors said the 1991 statewide Drought Water 
Bank "opened the door wide open" for water sales, leases and transfers. He said 
regulations are not keeping pace with marketing schemes. 
</P>
<P>
 "People ask, 'What are the rules?' " Macaulay said. "Well, they are less than 
clear."

 Is everyone trying to capitalize on the case?It isn't enough that there are 
billboards advertising such goods as Not Guilty jeans and DNA cologne around 
town. Now we've come across still another product that conjures up visions of 
the O.J. Simpson trial. It's called SeQuester. There's no real connection, 
though. SeQuester is merely a diet pill. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, maybe -- after you've taken it -- you're supposed to lock 
yourself up in a hotel room with no newspapers or television. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 It's a bad time for me to go on the air, Larry: Remember when Robert Shapiro, 
one of the attorneys for O.J. Simpson, received a call on his cellular phone in 
the courtroom, angering Superior Court Judge Lance Ito? Well, the newspaper 
Variety reports that sources identified the caller as none other than TV talk 
show host Larry King. 
</P>

<P>
 Anniversary-itis: We can't remember a year when there have been so many 
landmark -- and non-landmark -- events celebrated. Locally, there have been 
anniversaries celebrated by UCLA (75th), the Queen Mary (60th), commercial star 
Chiquita Banana (50th -- and don't you dare call her an old banana), and the 
L.A. Olympics and the incorporation of West Hollywood (the 10th for both). 
</P>
<P>
 But a few other epochal L.A. events have been overlooked. After all, 1994 also 
marks the: 
</P>
<P>
 * 5th anniversary of the world's first rock seance in Hollywood. Participants 
beseeched the late Jimi Hendrix to play a few bars of "Purple Haze." But his 
spirit was a no-show. 
</P>
<P>
 * 10th anniversary of singer Michael Jackson's hair catching fire during the 
filming of a Pepsi commercial at the Shrine Auditorium. 
</P>
<P>
 * 45th anniversary of the Battle of Sunset Boulevard, when mobster Mickey 
Cohen was wounded during a shootout as he left a nightclub. 
</P>
<P>
 * 55th anniversary of the Battle of Santa Monica Bay, when Tony Cornero used a 
fire hose in an unsuccessful attempt to prevent authorities from seizing his 
gambling boat, the Rex. 
</P>
<P>
 * 90th anniversary of the founding of Abbott Kinney's beach resort, Venice of 
America. The name was later shortened to Venice at the insistence of the rest 
of America. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks a lot, KFI: We notice that talk-radio station KFI has stopped running 
those ads that said, "Oh God. Baseball again. Not here." miscelLAny Paul Kneipp 
of L.A. read in a local newspaper that the goods at a Larchmont Village 
Sidewalk and Antique Sale would be sold through a "bargain process." He 
observed: "I believe that's the new, politically correct term for 'haggling.' "

 Two people who used an Oxnard aircraft company in a scheme to defraud the 
Federal Aviation Administration and private aircraft companies were sentenced 
Tuesday in U. S. District Court, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 James A. Fishback Sr., 60, of Redlands was sentenced to six months confinement 
in a community treatment center, fined $20,000 and placed on probation for five 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlene C. Christenson, 45, of Bloomington, received six months of home 
detention, was fined $15,000 and given three years probation. 
</P>
<P>
 Fishback and Christenson had pleaded guilty earlier this year to charges of 
onspiring to resell worn military engine liners as new parts for civilian jets, 
such as the Lear jet. 
</P>
<P>
 They purchased the used military parts from the now-defunct Dixon Aircraft 
Components of Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair also admitted to selling cheap, counterfeit jet engine liners from 
Taiwan to private aircraft companies, illegally circumventing FAA regulations, 
authorities said. MARY F. POLS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY SCHOOL BOARD OPPOSES PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a 45-minute debate, the Ventura County Board of Education approved a 
resolution opposing Proposition 187, the November ballot initiative that would 
bar illegal immigrants from public schools and deny them medical treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board voted 4 to 1 at its Monday evening meeting, with trustee 
Wendy Larner casting the dissenting vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Board member Juanita Sanchez-Valdez introduced the resolution to oppose the 
ballot measure. And several county residents addressed the board on the 
controversial issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Simi Valley resident Walt Madrid, who is running for a county school board 
seat, spoke in favor of the ballot measure, which would deny public schooling, 
non-emergency health care and other social services to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Two representatives of the Oxnard-based advocacy group El Concilio urged the 
board to take a public stand against the initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez-Valdez said Tuesday that the proposition was short-sighted. Immigrants 
come to the United States for jobs, she said, not for education and other 
public services. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than stem the tide of illegal immigration, she said, Proposition 187 
would create an underclass of illiterate, indigent state residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Immigrants are not going to leave the state" if the ballot measure passes, 
she said. "They're just going to become an underclass." 
</P>
<P>
 But Larner said at Monday's meeting that the point of Proposition 187 is to 
relieve taxpayers of the unfair burden of paying for social services for 
immigrants who are in the country illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody expects this to solve the immigration problem," she 
said. "The intention is that California taxpayers do not pay for services to 
criminals or the children of criminals." MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OJAI; FREE FORUM TONIGHT ON SELF-DEFENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A forum on self-defense and coping with assault will be held in Ojai tonight 
in response to a series of four attacks on area women since March. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to be able to tell the community there are a lot of options out 
there," said Elizabeth Wikle, one of the organizers.Both men and women are 
welcome at the free program. 
</P>
<P>
 Self-defense experts from Ventura and Santa Barbara are scheduled to speak 
along with several counselors trained to work with trauma victims. They will 
discuss ways to fend off attackers, from using pepper spray to martial 
arts-style skills. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative from the Coalition of Household Violence will talk about the 
group's support program for rape victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's detectives say they have not identified the man responsible for the 
attacks despite an intensive investigation that has included the scrutiny of 
160 potential suspects. At a meeting last week, a sheriff's official said the 
suspect -- described in hundreds of flyers posted around Ojai -- may live in 
the community or visit it frequently. 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight's meeting is being organized by a group formed by Wikle and several 
others called Ojai's PEACE of Mind. PEACE stands for Prevention & Awareness 
with Community Effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting begins at 7 p.m. in the Chaparral Auditorium at 414 E. Ojai Ave.

<P>
 A pedestrian using a crosswalk in Camarillo was hit by a Ventura County 
sheriff's van transporting inmate workers Tuesday afternoon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jon Hollister, 17, was treated and released from St. John's Pleasant Valley 
Hospital for cuts, scraps and bruises on his leg. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies said Hollister was walking in the 2100 block of Ventura Boulevard 
when he was struck by a Sheriff's Department Detention Services vehicle driven 
by technician Terry Okada. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident is under investigation by the Sheriff's Department, according to 
Lt. Gary Markley. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect tentatively that he (the driver) is going to be at fault," Markley 
said. "That is certainly the way it appears." MARY F. POLS

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a snafu in mailing flyers to parents, Camarillo High School officials 
are trying to get the word out on their annual back-to-school night. 
</P>
<P>
 Principal Terry Tackett said the person who usually prints address labels to 
parents of the school's 2,200 students was unable to do the job this year. So 
the school was left with piles of unaddressed flyers. 
</P>
<P>
 Back-to-school night, an annual event when parents can visit students' 
classrooms and meet their teachers, will be held at 7 p.m. Thursday. The event 
will begin in the school gymnasium. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information on the event, call the school at 389-6406. MAIA DAVIS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER DAWSON-PETIT SIGNAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J. E. MITCHELL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to ease rush-hour congestion through a southeast Camarillo 
intersection, the City Council tonight will consider spending nearly $85,000 to 
install a signal at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The signal light, if approved by the council, will be installed at the 
intersection of Dawson Drive and Petit Street, said city traffic engineer Tom 
Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have frustrated motorists ducking through neighborhood side streets to get 
around the tie-ups," Fox said. "We hope the new light will ease the congestion 
and cut back on the traffic flowing through the nearby neighborhoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Fox said Ventura-based Taft Electric Co. submitted the lowest bid at $84,738, 
and the city engineer's staff has recommended that the company get the 
contract. If approved by the council, construction will start within the month, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will meet at 5 p.m. at City Hall, 601 Carmen Drive. J. E. MITCHELL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; FUNDS SOUGHT, BUT ROAD STAYS BLOCKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A road covered with rocks from a landslide nearly three weeks ago will remain 
blocked while Ventura County officials seek federal and state funds to remove 
the debris. 
</P>
<P>
 The County Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to declare the rockslide on 
South Mountain Road near Santa Paula a "state of local emergency," thus 
speeding up the paperwork for removing the 70,000 to 100,000 cubic yards of 
debris. 
</P>
<P>
 But the supervisors provided no money for the project, relying instead on the 
Federal Highway Administration to come through with the $200,000 to $300,000 
needed for the cleanup. 
</P>
<P>
 Linking the landslide to an aftershock of the January earthquake, the county's 
Public Works Agency is seeking federal emergency funds for its repair. 
</P>
<P>
 If the federal money is not granted, officials will turn to the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The county, itself, has little money available for the unexpected cleanup 
project, said county Public Works Director Arthur E. Goulet. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (county) road fund is not healthy," Goulet said. "We suffered a big hit. 
This is not going to be easy to accommodate in the budget." 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisors urged him to contact California's congressional delegation for 
help with the project, so that the dirt and rocks can be removed before the 
autumn rains delays the work for months. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a road that you can leave obstructed," Supervisor Maggie Kildee 
said. "It is taking a long time to get everything in line." PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK; WIFE FACES ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGE

<P>
 Her forearm wrapped in a thick bandage, a Newbury Park woman charged with 
attempted murder for allegedly knocking a car off two jack stands while her 
estranged husband lay underneath made her first court appearance Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Municipal Judge Herbert Curtis III postponed 44-year-old Marcia 
Burns' arraignment until Oct. 12 to allow the defendant's attorney time to 
review police reports.Curtis lowered her bail from $250,000 to $150,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns, who is unemployed and has lived in the county for three years, was 
charged Tuesday with one count of attempted murder and faces nine years in 
state prison if convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 In a soft voice, she answered "yes" when a judge asked her if would waive her 
right to a speedy arraignment, a request made by Burns' attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies say Jimmy Lee Burns, 40, was working under a jacked-up car at 1355 
Lawrence Drive on Sept. 23 when his wife rear-ended the vehicle, knocking it 
onto the man. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim was treated and released for a severely bruised left arm at Los 
Robles Regional Medical Center. Marcia Burns fled the scene but was taken into 
custody several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 She was arrested as she tried to elude officers after crashing her car near 
Ventu Park Road in Newbury Park, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 California Highway Patrol officials said she tripped and fell about 200 feet 
down a brush-choked embankment during her failed escape. 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials said Burns, who is being held in Ventura County Jail, has no 
criminal convictions. DWAYNE BRAY

 They arrived in limousines, wearing their black and gold uniforms proudly and 
exulting at the lavish attention. They were the Newbury Park Bobby Sox, the 
girls' softball national champions -- and to their amazement, everyone knew it. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks council members on Tuesday honored the two championship Bobby 
Sox teams from Newbury Park: the 9- to 11-year-olds and the 12- to 
15-year-olds. For the first time in the league's 22-year history, both 
divisions captured national titles this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Lending the celebration some celebrity sparkle, Detroit Tigers manager Sparky 
Anderson greeted the young softball players with spirited applause. And Mayor 
Alex Fiore handed each Bobby Sox team an official commendation from the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Several softball players had grumbled this summer that both the press and the 
politicians seemed to ignore their accomplishments, focusing instead on the 
championship Thousand Oaks Little League teams. But on Tuesday, they pronounced 
themselves well-satisfied with the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're getting the recognition we deserve," 15-year-old Stacie Beshore, a star 
pitcher and power hitter, said cheerfully. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting council members was a thrill, she added, because "they're older and 
they have power and stuff, so it's great that they're recognizing our sport." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the hoopla at City Hall, the Bobby Sox attended a pep rally in Borchard 
Park, complete with inspirational speeches from older local athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a moment they will always remember as the end of their long summer of 
hard work and success, " league President Joseph Joyce said. STEPHANIE SIMON

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; CITY TO DEBATE NEW ICE RINK PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With an Olympic-sized ice rink scheduled to open in Simi Valley in October, 
city planners tonight will debate whether another new rink should be allowed on 
a parcel just a few miles away. 
</P>
<P>
 The new proposal, to build an ice rink alongside retail stores on 27 acres at 
Royal Avenue and Madera Road, faces opposition from nearby residents, who say 
it will generate too much traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents voted against the project at a September neighborhood council 
meeting, saying the addition of a second ice rink will bring too many skaters 
from outside the city. They say it will mean more traffic on Madera Road, a 
street already well used. 
</P>
<P>
 The Easy Street Arena, a skating facility with two rinks, is slated to open in 
October, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 City planners said Tuesday that noise and traffic from the Madera Road project 
are problems that cannot be controlled because the levels on the street are 
already high. 
</P>
<P>
 Planning commissioners are scheduled to review traffic, noise and other 
potential impacts of the project, and vote on whether to rezone the parcel for 
the ice rink and shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be held at 7 p.m. at City Hall. MATTHEW MOSK

workers, who have been without a contract since 1992, official Mario Brito said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 To prepare for the strike, donated food was distributed to 150 field and 
packinghouse workers Friday by the local chapter of the United Farm Workers, 
Brito said. 
</P>
<P>
 The union has also begun passing out flyers written in Spanish and English to 
workers and others who might be hired by Muranaka to fill jobs during a 
walkout, he said. "We're asking for their support, and we're asking that they 
not break the strike," Brito said. "The flyer says this should be a time for 
solidarity." 
</P>
<P>
 Fed up with delays in negotiating a contract, the workers recently voted for a 
strike. The negotiations have been delayed most recently by a lengthy vacation 
by Muranaka's lawyer, who is out of the country until Oct. 18, Brito said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the workers strike, it would be the first that United Farm Workers have 
struck in Ventura County since 1983, when laborers at Muranaka walked out over 
the issue of union representation. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, workers have demonstrated outside the company's Moorpark 
packinghouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Muranaka farms about 450 acres in Ventura County, company representatives 
said. SCOTT HADLY

EARTHQUAKE REPAIRS MAY HIT $16 MILLION FOR SIMI VALLEY SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Earthquake-related repairs for Simi Valley schools will exceed $6 million and 
could cost as much as $16 million, depending on how many buildings must be 
upgraded to meet current seismic codes, school district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simi Valley Unified School District has received $3.8 million in disaster 
relief funds so far, federal officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 But local school officials said they expect state and federal agencies to 
provide the extra money for all repairs, which include wall cracks and the 
replacement of overhead lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs to quake-damaged schools were previously estimated at about $5 
million. But after compiling hundreds of damage survey reports, district 
officials now say losses exceed earlier projections. 
</P>
<P>
 "The immediate repairs will cost in the neighborhood of $6 million," Supt. 
Mary Beth Wolford said. "However, based on the architectural and engineering 
reports, we may need to further renovate our schools. That could go as high as 
$14 (million) to $16 million." 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency and the state Office of Emergency 
Services are providing funds for such improvements as the replacement of 
ceiling tiles with more earthquake-resistant materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to do studies to see what we are eligible for," Wolford said. 
"The initial emergency repairs were to get the schools open. This is a little 
different. . . . We are moving more from the reactive to the proactive mode." 
</P>
<P>
 For earthquake repairs, FEMA provides 90% of the repair cost and the state 
provides 10%. For earthquake-related improvements designed to lessen damage in 
the event of future disasters, FEMA provides 75% of the cost and the state 
provides 25%, a FEMA spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Simi Valley schools were built about 20 or 30 years ago and could qualify 
for government-funded improvements because they do not meet current state 
seismic standards, district officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools are upgraded to new seismic codes only if new buildings are 
constructed or old structures are remodeled, district spokesman Lowell Shultze 
said. All 33 Simi Valley schools suffered some damage during the Northridge 
earthquake, Shultze said, with campuses in the east end hit hardest. Twelve 
schools sustained structural damage. 
</P>
<P>
 The most costly repairs will be at Simi Valley High School, where both the 
gymnasium and multipurpose room suffered severe structural damage. Repairs are 
expected to cost about $2 million, Shultze said. Both structures will remain 
closed for the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials are seeking federal funds for a temporary Simi Valley High 
gym. In the meantime, physical education classes must be held outdoors. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is a priority project for us," Shultze said of the temporary gym. "I'm 
hoping we can have something in there by the first of the year." 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake-related repairs at Sequoia Junior High School and Mountain View 
School are also expected to be costly, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction workers demolished stucco overhangs at both campuses over the 
Labor Day weekend after architectural and engineering studies determined that 
the heavy plaster might not withstand another quake, Shultze said. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs and upgrades to Simi Valley schools could take months, if not years. 
"We really don't have a timeline set," Shultze said, adding that at least 30 
damage studies are still in progress.

OBITUARIES ; * ARCHER GORDON; KNOWN AS THE 'FATHER' OF CPR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BURT A. FOLKART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Archer Gordon, the heart specialist considered the "father" of CPR whose 
family of life-sized mannequins helped thousands of people save tens of 
thousands of lives, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 A family spokesman said Monday that Dr. Gordon, a onetime researcher at UCLA 
who came up with the idea of his "Resusci Family" while studying artificial 
respiration techniques under a Red Cross grant, was 73 when he died Sept. 18. 
He died of the complications of diabetes at a Thousand Oaks hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 He and his wife, Pansy, raised three children during their 43 years in the 
Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon was studying physiology at the University of Illinois as a young doctor 
in the late 1950s at a time when it was first being learned that mouth-to-mouth 
resuscitation was far more effective than the then-prominent resuscitation 
method of back pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1960, he and others were expounding the merits of mouth-to-mouth combined 
with external compression. 
</P>
<P>
 To further his belief that "it is better to teach a lot of people a little CPR 
than to teach a lot to a few," he came up with the idea of the Resusci Family: 
Anne, Andy and Baby, each physically correct for their sex and size. 
</P>
<P>
 Using the mannequins for mouth to mouth while also applying steady, rhythmic 
pressure on their breastbones, office workers, teachers and parents, and not 
just medical and rescue personnel, were taught how to save the lives of heart 
attack, drowning, choking, electric shock and drug abuse victims. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Asmund Laerdal, a Norwegian doll maker, devised the lifelike dolls and 
Gordon produced dozens of training films and hundreds of articles on their use. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in its early years -- the 1960s and '70s -- CPR was credited with saving 
25% to 30% of victims if used in the first few minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although known worldwide as CPR's father, Gordon said that the original 
resuscitation theories were worked out by a Johns Hopkins research team and 
that he became identified with it through mouth-to-mouth techniques of revival 
plus his mannequins. 
</P>
<P>
 Or saving lives by "playing with dolls," as wrote People magazine in a 1978 
article about him.

SHOP OWNERS OFFER IDEAS TO REVAMP BOULEVARD; THOUSAND OAKS: AT A PUBLIC FORUM, 
PROPRIETORS CITE PROBLEMS OF CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT. BRAINSTORMING SESSION 
IS HAILED AS A GOOD FIRST STEP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anxious business owners, concerned they might be left out of plans to revamp 
Thousand Oaks' main thoroughfare, told city officials Tuesday they are ready to 
take an active roll in the redevelopment of Thousand Oaks Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 At a public forum in the Civic Arts Plaza, about 50 shop owners said the 
city's central business district suffers from parking problems, crime and 
neglect in some areas. And, they took the first steps to offer possible 
solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was the first of its kind, joining shop owners with city 
officials, Ventura County sheriff's officials and community leaders. Most 
called the brainstorming session a good start. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just words so far. But the words were good," said Michael Medina, owner 
of a pet store on the boulevard. "If they make the changes we discussed, I 
think it could have a real positive effect on local businesses." 
</P>
<P>
 At the close of the two-hour session, the business leaders agreed to support 
Councilwoman Judy Lazar's proposal to consult with out-of-town planners to map 
the future of the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar, who moderated the session, said she would ask the council to invite a 
group of unpaid consultants to meet with the business leaders. The consultants 
volunteer their time as part of an urban renewal program run by the American 
Institute of Architects, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, several shop owners said consulting out-of-town planners would be a 
mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't have any way of finding them later if things go wrong," businessman 
Dave Anderson said. "We have local people here in Thousand Oaks that could do 
this just as well." 
</P>
<P>
 But Francisco Behr, a Thousand Oaks architect who initially told Lazar about 
the consulting program, persuaded the group that outside advice was needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people work with plans generated by you, and they do not carry the 
baggage from the years of debate over the boulevard," Behr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year Lazar had requested that the city use the consultants, but 
was rebuffed by council members who said the idea lacked community support. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar said she will return to the council with the backing of the shop owners. 
For their part, the shop owners said they hope to become more of a force in 
city government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think as a group we have a lot more clout," Medina said. "And, I think that 
based on the way this went, more business owners will get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lazar sought to keep the focus of discussion on long-term planning, 
many of those present said they were intent on solving more immediate problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we should divide it up, and deal with the short-term and the 
long-term issues separately," businessman Larry Carignan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Store owners said they want the city to increase police presence, tow away 
junked cars, demolish abandoned buildings, increase parking and loosen 
restrictions on the use of signs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those are all things that can be dealt with now," Carignan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lazar said she would draft a memo to the council asking for help in solving 
some of the immediate issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But ultimately, she said, tackling long-range plans could be the most fruitful 
for business owners. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's taken us a long time to get to this point," she told the store owners. 
"But you know what's best for your businesses, and with you on board I think we 
can be successful."

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; MONEY LOOKING FOR A HOME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California is in recession. Many of those lucky enough to remain 
employed have had to switch jobs or forgo raises. And yet thousands of 
taxpayers have moved without telling the Internal Revenue Service where to send 
their refunds? Strange days indeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Laguna Niguel district of the IRS covers Orange County and four other 
counties, plus pockets of Los Angeles County. District officials say they are 
looking for more than 10,000 taxpayers, whom the federal government owes a 
total of $6.2 million. Those figures are the highest in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Though returning the money is part of the IRS' job, the agency deserves credit 
for taking the extra step. In many cases the Postal Service could not find the 
address that the taxpayer had given; IRS officials, rather than simply 
shrugging and depositing the money in the fund to offset the federal deficit, 
are continuing the search. 
</P>
<P>
 The IRS says the well-known mobility of Southern Californians is one reason 
for the undeliverable mail: People just pick up and move without telling the 
postal or tax people. Still, it's one thing to leave behind an easy chair 
that's seen better days and quite another to leave behind a pile of dollars. 
The refunds range up to $3,000, with an average of about $650. 
</P>
<P>
 Some refunds do not get mailed at all, because the filers have supplied 
invalid Social Security numbers. Often it's just a matter of numbers being 
transposed erroneously, but some returns are phony, filed by people 
fraudulently trying to establish residence in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Those taxpayers who know they should have received refunds should contact an 
IRS office. A spokeswoman says the agency wants to give the money away . . . 
"contrary to our image, of course." There's a message here for cynics about the 
IRS. The tax collector really does have a heart.

MAY'S THIRD-PERIOD GOAL LIFTS STARS OVER KINGS, 3-2 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 Alan May scored the winning goal after assisting on the tying score in the 
Dallas Stars' 3-2 exhibition victory over the Kings on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Stars (4-1-4) are tied with the Washington Capitals, New Jersey Devils and 
St. Louis Blues for the most points during the exhibition season with 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Storr, the Kings' first-round pick in the 1994 draft, stopped 24 of 25 
shots for the Kings (4-3-1) before being replaced. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Stars trailing, 2-1, May assisted on Jarkko Varvio's goal at 5:04 of 
the third period. That came 29 seconds after John Druce had put the Kings 
ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:12, May scored the winning goal against Robb Stauber. 
</P>
<P>
 Darryl Sydor gave the Kings a 1-0 lead at 16:48 of the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Gagner tied the score at 1-1 when he scored at 9:28 of the second. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier Tuesday, forward Gino Odjick of the Vancouver Canucks was suspended 
for 10 regular-season games as the result of an altercation during an 
exhibition game against the Kings. 
</P>
<P>
 Odjick was approaching the Vancouver bench late in the third period when he 
turned and joined the altercation, spearing the Kings' Warren Rychel and then 
fighting with him. Odjick was assessed a game misconduct for his actions.

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD

<TEXT>
<P>
 What a wonderful weekend this should be -- the last weekend of the baseball 
regular season and the first weekend of the hockey season. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Ha! . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The NHL owners and their beloved commissioner, Gary Bettman, appear determined 
to blow the greatest opportunity the sport has ever had. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 NBA interest has declined. Baseball is shut down. The NHL playoffs last season 
were the best of the expansion era. But the owners and gregarious Gary want to 
lock out the players, who are more sensible than their baseball brethren, and 
delay the opening of the season. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Call it the Nitwit Hockey League. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Christian Okoye, the former NFL rushing leader who is living in Southern 
California, says he is ready, eager and able to help any team in need of 
someone to get the necessary yardage on third and short. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Okoye, 33, is a year younger than Marcus Allen. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Among the surprises of the season is that the Denver Broncos have twice been 
unable to finish off what might have been a game-winning or game-tying comeback 
because of a fumble and a bad pass by their quarterback. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The Broncos and the Raiders rank last and next to last in the league in points 
allowed. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 As long as there is overtime, don't expect to see an NFL coach go for a 
two-point conversion when his team is a point behind late in the game. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The first pro football game ever televised was between the Brooklyn Dodgers 
and Philadelphia Eagles on Oct. 22, 1939, at Ebbets Field. It was seen on an 
estimated 1,000 sets and announcer Allen (Skip) Walz was paid $25. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Without quarterback Tommie Frazier in the lineup, Nebraska might be held to 
fewer than 50 points by Wyoming on Saturday in Lincoln. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Washington's weekly update on Napoleon Kaufman notes that his 11-game 
touchdown streak was stopped by Miami and that he was limited to 80 yards, but 
that he gained 65 in the second half, when the Huskies overcame a 14-3 deficit 
to win, 38-20. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Pernell Whitaker should repeat his earlier victory over Buddy McGirt on 
Saturday in Norfolk, Va., and retain his mythical title of best fighter, pound 
for pound -- at least until the James Toney-Roy Jones Jr. bout. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Rafael Ruelas, who defends his International Boxing Federation lightweight 
title against Billy Schwer Oct. 22 in Hong Kong, is in Big Bear and "training 
like a hungry fighter because I see all these champions getting upset." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 One of the victims was James Leija, who lost to Gabriel Ruelas. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 On the phone from Houston, George Foreman told Bob Arum that he is well on his 
way to trimming down to 240 or less for his bout Nov. 5 in Las Vegas against 
WBA champion Michael Moorer. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'll believe it when I see it, but the postponed Riddick Bowe-Larry Donald 
fight has been rescheduled for Dec. 3. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Arantxa Sanchez Vicario's $2,054,665 puts her only $51,647 behind Pete Sampras 
in earnings this year. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Keep an eye on apprentice jockey Geoff Cooper, who just turned 16, during the 
Oak Tree meeting that begins next Wednesday at Santa Anita. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Best Pal, racing's richest active thoroughbred with earnings of more than $5 
million, won't be supplemented into the Breeders' Cup Classic Nov. 5 at 
Churchill Downs and will race instead in the California Cup Classic Oct. 29 at 
Santa Anita. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Harold Miner might get his wish and be traded by the Miami Heat to the 
Portland Trail Blazers for Clyde Drexler. Coach Kevin Loughery gave Miner an 
average of only 21 minutes of playing time last season. Drexler is 32 and is 
contracted for a balloon payment of $8 million before the 1995-96 season. . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 You've got to figure that the Baltimore Orioles and Boston Red Sox will make 
offers to Tony LaRussa when his contract with the Oakland A's expires next 
week. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Angels Care, the California Angels' official charity, will stage a celebrity 
bowling event Saturday at 11:30 a.m. at Regal Lanes in Orange. For $35, bowlers 
can participate on teams with celebrities, including Bert Blyleven, Tommy 
Davis, Vince Ferragamo, Fred Lynn, Ken Brett and Bob Starr. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 How much has baseball attendance increased over the years? Ken Burns' 
documentary reminded us that only 10,000 fans at Fenway Park watched Ted 
Williams hit a home run in the last at-bat of his career in 1960. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Not too many more watched Roger Maris hit his 61st homer in 1961 at Yankee 
Stadium. . . .

ROUNDUP; SECOND-RANKED SAN CLEMENTE SHUTS DOWN NO. 1 CORONA DEL MAR IN WATER 
POLO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN ARRITT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Clemente water polo team held Corona del Mar to four goals in the 
final three quarters and defeated the top-ranked Sea Kings, 13-10, Tuesday at 
Corona del Mar High. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-ranked Tritons (6-1), who lost to the Sea Kings, 11-7, in the 
semifinals of the South Coast tournament Saturday, never trailed Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 After a fast-paced first quarter that ended in a 6-6 tie, the Sea Kings failed 
to score on 10 consecutive possessions and San Clemente led 7-6 at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Corona del Mar (5-2) increased its defensive effort in the third quarter and 
Adrian Strelzow's goal ended the Sea Kings' scoring drought and cut the Triton 
lead to one goal with 5 minutes 40 seconds left in the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jordan Hewko scored his fifth goal of the game and Andy Bailey added 
another goal a minute later to increase the Tritons' lead to three. 
</P>
<P>
 A penalty-shot goal by Neil Hueston made it 10-8 at the end of three quarters, 
but the Tritons started the fourth with a man-advantage goal by Colin 
Shaughnessy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thad Buzolich cut the lead to 11-9 with 3:31 remaining, but that's as close as 
the Sea Kings would come as Andy Bailey and Jim Farley scored late in the game 
to secure the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Gabe Gardner had 10 saves, including five in the fourth quarter, for the 
Tritons. 
</P>
<P>
 Hueston had five goals and Buzolich added three to lead the Sea Kings. DAN

TENNIS ROUNDUP; LAGUNA BEACH ROLLS BY NEWPORT HARBOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Laguna Beach has Orange County bragging rights, for now, after the top-ranked 
Artists' defeated No. 2 Newport Harbor, 11-7, in girls' tennis Tuesday at 
Newport Harbor High School. 
</P>
<P>
 The Artists, ranked No. 1 in Division II, rolled over the Sailors in the first 
round, taking a 5-1 lead.Laguna Beach (6-1) swept its doubles in the round and 
suffered its only loss when Sarah Hawkins defeated Lindsay Weiss, 6-0, in 
singles. 
</P>
<P>
 "The doubles were huge," Artist Coach Bob Walton said. "The first round was 
the key. There was no way I thought we'd sweep." 
</P>
<P>
 Aiming for their third consecutive Southern Section Division II title, the 
Artists looked strong in doubles and singles. 
</P>
<P>
 Amanda Hastings-Phillips led the way, sweeping her first two singles sets, 
6-0, 6-1, before scoring a 6-4 victory over Hawkins. A senior, Hawkins usually 
plays in the No. 1 spot for Newport Harbor (2-1), but moved to the No. 3 
position so she could get some extra warm-up time. She won her other set 6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 At No. 1 doubles, Sarah Cohen and Vanessa Zajfen took two of three, 6-4, 2-6, 
6-1, losing to the the Sailors' sophomore team of Katie Canright and Emily 
Barker. 
</P>
<P>
 Zajfen, disappointed by her play, cracked the books between sets. After Zajfen 
got some homework done, she and Cohen defeated Katie Hawkins and Brooke Taylor, 
6-1. 
</P>
<P>
 After the match Walton was all smiles. "I'm glad we aren't Division I," he 
said. "Now we can go back and play Division II." MELANIE NEFF

VOLLEYBALL ROUNDUP; NO. 1 SAILORS LEAVE NO. 2 ARTISTS REELING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The Newport Harbor girls' volleyball machine revved its engine Tuesday, and 
the Sailors, ranked No. 1 in Orange County, throttled second-ranked Laguna 
Beach in three games to win a nonleague match at Laguna Beach High. 
</P>
<P>
 Misty May had 14 kills and Melissa Schutz had nine kills and three blocks for 
Newport Harbor, which won, 15-3, 15-8, 15-6, in a match that lasted a little 
more than one hour. 
</P>
<P>
 The result was somewhat surprising considering the Artists extended Newport 
Harbor to the limit in the final of the Orange County Championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Laguna Beach (1-1) held a match point against the Sailors Sept. 17, but 
Newport Harbor (3-0) rallied to win, 15-17, 17-15, 15-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesday, there was no repeat performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor scored the first eight points of the match, taking advantage of 
numerous unforced errors by Laguna Beach. Setter Jenny Hecker, who had 27 
assists, served six consecutive points to give the Sailors a 7-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 In Game 2, Laguna Beach was even at 5-5, then May notched four kills to help 
the Sailors score seven consecutive points before closing out the game, 15-8. 
</P>
<P>
 Game 3 featured more of the same with Schutz tallying three kills to help 
Newport Harbor score eight consecutive points and take an 11-3 lead before 
winning, 15-6. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids were focused tonight," Newport Harbor Coach Dan Glenn said. "Last 
time we played Laguna, we made a ton of unforced errors. But we stepped it up 
tonight and that was good to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Sailors were near the top of their game, Laguna Beach's 
performance neared rock bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 The Artists' offense sputtered, with Michelle Christ, who had six kills, and 
Lisa Ravensburg, who had four kills and three blocks, leading the way.  
</P>
<P>
 "Our passing, our hitting, our digging, everything was out of sync tonight," 
said Laguna Beach Coach Michael Soylular. "But we're not going to give up after 
this one. This loss will make us work harder." MICHAEL ITAGAKI

COLLEGE FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; USC; OREGON QUARTERBACK O'NEIL TO SIT OUT 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Oregon quarterback Danny O'Neil will not play against USC Saturday at the 
Coliseum.  
</P>
<P>
 O'Neil, a senior from Newport Beach, underwent surgery on the ring finger of 
his passing hand Monday night for removal of an abscess. Doctors diagnosed the 
ailment as "a very rare staph infection," Oregon Coach Rich Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Danny has no idea how he got it," said Brooks of his four-year starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he first noticed it last Thursday night playing cards, that the 
finger was sore and had a small bump on it. The finger began to swell Friday 
night, and he had a bad time with it in our game Saturday (Oregon beat Iowa, 
40-18)." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Baylor defensive end Scotty Lewis talked a good game last week. Before going 
up against USC All-American offensive tackle Tony Boselli, in an interview with 
the Daily Trojan, Lewis said of Boselli: 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been watching Boselli on film and he's not as good a run blocker as he 
is a pass blocker."  
</P>
<P>
 Boselli, 6 feet 8 and 320 pounds, saw the quote and reacted accordingly. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach John Robinson: "Tony had as dominant a game as any offensive 
lineman I ever saw." 
</P>
<P>
 But even a game-long pounding didn't silence Lewis, 6-3 and 265. 
</P>
<P>
 The Daily Trojan also interviewed him afterward, and he said of Boselli, "He's 
a dirty player. . . . He was cheap-shotting me the whole game, and tripping me 
too." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At one point in Saturday's game, the Trojans had an all-freshman defensive 
line: Darrell Russell of San Diego, George Perry of San Bernardino and Cedric 
Jefferson of Ft. Worth, Tex. . . . When Baylor's Ben Bronson returned a kickoff 
98 yards against USC, it was the first return for a score against the Trojans 
since Stanford's Bruce Davis returned a kickoff 99 yards in 1991. . . . Ken 
Grace's nine receptions Saturday were his career high. He has caught a pass in 
12 consecutive games. EARL GUSTKEY

PACIFIC 10 FOOTBALL / DAN HAFNER; REPORTS OF DEMISE GREATLY EXAGGERATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN HAFNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just a few days ago, Pacific 10 Conference football was given up for dead. Its 
teams couldn't even beat Western Athletic Conference opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 17, Pac-10 teams played six nonconference opponents. Only one, 
Nebraska, was considered a national power. The Cornhuskers humiliated UCLA, but 
the other Pac-10 teams lost, too, except Stanford, which romped over weak San 
Jose State. 
</P>
<P>
 The sorry start of the season, which included losses to Hawaii by California 
and Oregon, prompted one writer to suggest that the Pac-10, not the Southwest 
Conference, is the conference that should be disbanding. 
</P>
<P>
 But now? Suddenly, the Pac-10 is being noticed again nationwide -- especially 
the Washington Huskies, who ended college football's longest home winning 
streak at 58 games with a convincing 38-20 victory at Miami's Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 That was the big story, but there were other performances to encourage Pac-10 
followers. USC, which has beaten Washington, was an impressive winner over 
Baylor. Oregon, beaten by two WAC rivals, crushed Iowa of the Big Ten, 40-18. 
</P>
<P>
 And the league's two unbeaten teams, defensive powers Arizona and Washington 
State, scored one-sided victories. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Washington's week, though. Hurricane fans had the 59th "tombstone" 
ready when the Huskies arrived. And, after Miami built a 14-3 halftime lead, 
there was no indication the streak would end. 
</P>
<P>
 But Coach Jim Lambright had with him a dedicated group, egged on by about 
3,000 fans who had traveled more than 3,000 miles for their day in the sun. It 
turned out to be as big as the Rose Bowl, which the Huskies had a firm grip on 
until struck down by penalties last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Huskies, beginning with a 75-yard scoring pass play to fullback Richard 
Thomas early in the third quarter, defied the odds and took charge. The heat 
and humidity were supposed to wear down the Northwest team. Instead, the 
Huskies kept getting stronger and took control of the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 And quarterback Damon Huard, who lost his poise late in the USC loss, came of 
age as a top Pac-10 quarterback. He was superb in the last 30 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "In all my career, I never saw anything like this," said Lambright, who has 
spent a quarter of a century with the Huskies, the last two as head coach. "It 
was a wild celebration, for sure." 
</P>
<P>
 Miami fans have a reputation for being a bit nasty, but when the Huskies went 
by the Hurricane rooting section on the way to the dressing room, they received 
nothing but cheers. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Bill Walsh is gaining a reputation as a coach who puts his foot in his mouth, 
and often. Almost every opponent the Cardinal plays these days is stirred by 
some remark Walsh has made. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Coach Dick Tomey said his Arizona players never even discussed 
Walsh's comments about them in his book "Rough Magic," the Wildcats played like 
a team with a grudge to settle Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh was riding high after posting a 10-3 record when he returned to Stanford 
in 1992, then he had one of the best recruiting years in the nation for his 
second season. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Genius" apparently got a bit carried away. He said that in two years, 
which would be this season, Stanford would be in the running for the Rose Bowl. 
He also predicted that the Cardinal would be in some bowl almost every year and 
might be in the top five in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year was supposed to be a building year. First, though, he antagonized 
the Washington Huskies and they smashed Stanford, 31-14, maybe a big reason for 
a dismal 4-7 season. 
</P>
<P>
 As recently as last Friday night, Walsh thought Stanford was on the move. He 
said his team had a great chance to beat Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody will run away from this team," Walsh said. "We will be in every game." 
</P>
<P>
 The genius was wrong. The score was 34-10 and the game wasn't that close. 
</P>
<P>
 "We aren't as close to them as we thought we were," Walsh said. "This is a 
really good Arizona team. We're not as smart as we thought we were." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tomey says he doesn't know how good his defense is. Although the Wildcats 
sacked Steve Stenstrom seven times and forced him into a fumble and two 
interceptions, Tomey is still wondering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Stanford could only throw," he said. "So for the third time, we didn't face 
much of an offense. 
</P>
<P>
 "This week we won't find out either. Oregon State's offense is one of the 
toughest to defend. But it's the opposite of Stanford. The Beavers run the ball 
and don't pass. With an extra week to prepare, they will come up with some new 
option wrinkles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are so concerned with Jerry Pettibone's offense that we spent more time 
working against the Beavers in the week we had off than we did against 
Stanford. We had a pretty good idea what Walsh was going to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the Pac-10 media day last summer, Washington State Coach Mike Price was 
accompanied by his defensive star, end DeWayne Patterson. As they prepared to 
face reporters, Patterson turned to the coach and said, "Should we tell them 
that we expect to come back here for the Rose Bowl game?" 
</P>
<P>
 It was decided to keep it a secret, so the Cougars, although they had seven 
starters back from the eighth-best defense in the nation a year ago, were 
picked to finish last. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was kind of easy to figure," Price said. "The whole day was spent 
talking about all the great quarterbacks in the Pac-10. We were the only team 
without a veteran quarterback returning. 
</P>
<P>
 "But we knew we had a very good team. We knew that Chad Davis, our sophomore 
quarterback from San Diego, was a good one. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although the defense has been there from the start, we think the offense is 
coming along, too. Davis has shown a lot of poise." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the 21-0 victory over UCLA was one of the most satisfying in his six 
seasons at Washington State, Price says it's too early to know what kind of a 
season it's going to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cougars (3-0) go into Tennessee on Saturday, favored over the once-vaunted 
Volunteers, whose top two quarterbacks are sidelined. 
</P>
<P>
 An early showdown figures to be unveiled Oct. 15, when Arizona and the Cougars 
play at Pullman. Wash. Now, that should be a real defensive battle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is quite likely that Stanford's Stenstrom will become an NFL star. As Walsh 
points out, he has abundant talent and could probably help several teams right 
now. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever the future, though, Stenstrom is ecstatic about one thing. He never 
has to face Arizona's "Desert Swarm" again. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats cause him nightmares. Two years ago, they beat him up, finally 
sending him out with a concussion and a 21-6 defeat. Last year, he had his best 
effort, but his fumble in the last minute cost Stanford a probable tie and a 
possible victory. Arizona won, 27-24. 
</P>
<P>
 He completed 26 of 43 passes for 295 yards last week and that looks good on 
paper. But his seven sacks, fumble and interceptions tell a different story. 
</P>
<P>
 Stenstrom still leads the Pac-10 in total offense and passing efficiency but 
the big thing is, he doesn't have to face the Wildcats again.

OUTDOOR NOTES / PETE THOMAS: LANDING THIS MARLIN STILL PAINFUL MEMORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It has been a week since Patrick Walsh caught his fish and he still is 
reeling. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've still got blisters on two of my fingers just from the reel heat," Walsh 
said Tuesday. "That's how brutal it was." 
</P>
<P>
 He was talking about his battle with a black marlin while fishing from a panga 
in a howling wind on a choppy Sea of Cortez. 
</P>
<P>
 Walsh, 50, fishing out of Gordo Banks Sportfishing in San Jose Del Cabo, was 
trolling a five-pound tuna when the massive billfish struck, taking off on a 
high run and tail-dancing into the horizon.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had to chase it," the Venice resident said. "On the first run it took 350 
yards of line and almost spooled me." 
</P>
<P>
 The skipper was Marcello Gonzalez, who is known for finding and catching big 
billfish. He landed one of the few 1,000-pound marlin ever taken in the region 
a few years ago and reportedly caught another this year. 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned from the recent outing with Walsh and his two partners, 
including fleet operator Eric Brictson, it was dark. But a crowd had gathered 
on the beach at La Playita, awaiting their arrival. Walsh left them the fish, 
estimated at more than 600 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was dark when we got in," Walsh said. "So we couldn't weigh it." 
</P>
<P>
 A larger black marlin, after a much shorter fight from a much bigger boat, was 
weighed in last week at the Cabo San Lucas scale. A 720-pounder was landed by 
Lodi's Kelly Olds aboard the Gaviota III, another boat with a 1,000-pound 
marlin to its credit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Black to blue: The season is shaping up well off Cabo San Lucas. Several blue 
marlin have been seen cruising the clear, blue Baja water. 
</P>
<P>
 Notable catches in the last week: a 590-pound blue aboard the Carmelita, a 
520-pounder aboard Reel Affair and a 482-pounder -- after a four-hour fight -- 
aboard Pisces Andrea. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the time of year everybody's getting spooled with the 80-pound test 
by these big blues," said Mario Banaga, a spokesman for the Pisces Fleet, 
adding that the bigger fish usually stick around until mid-November. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The tuna bite south of San Diego is more consistent than it has been all 
season, as far as the overnight fleet is concerned.  
</P>
<P>
 Trouble is, business is nearly as slow as it was when there were no fish, 
which was not unexpected. Fishermen by and large consider the season over after 
Labor Day. 
</P>
<P>
 But those still fishing are enjoying unsurpassed action. Anglers on the 
Holiday, returning from a 3 1/2-day trip, found one of the better bites in 
one-day range while returning Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 "We had a quadruple hookup and then picked up 180 tuna on one stop only 37 
miles from San Diego," said charter master Ron Kovach, adding that the fish 
were running eight to 18 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas small yellowfin are being targeted close to San Diego, much larger 
bluefin tuna are a bit farther south. 
</P>
<P>
 Anglers aboard Dan Sansome's American Angler boated 91 bluefin during a 
three-day trip that ended Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 51 that weighed more than 100 pounds," Sansome said. "It's the best 
bite on the big tuna I've seen in a while." 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently. The vessel left Point Loma Sunday night on a five-day trip and on 
Monday Roger Hawtree of San Diego boated a 230-pounder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Deception can be costly, the Department of Fish and Game says of anglers who 
are trying to outsmart the state agency and its new rule requiring fishermen to 
display their licenses above the waist. 
</P>
<P>
 Colored-paper and computer-produced counterfeit licenses have been showing up 
at Lake Piru in Ventura County and Pyramid Lake in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 "Displaying a bogus license can be a very expensive mistake," warned DeWayne 
Johnson, the DFG's top warden, adding that the fine can exceed $500.

FISHING REPORT: CATFISH AND RACCOON ARE ACTIVE AT LAKE PIRU 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's not often that all the catfish in a lake decide to feed at once.But it 
seems to have happened at Lake Piru. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have no idea why, but we've had over 300 pounds of catfish caught since 
Friday," said Art Caldara, manager of the Ventura County reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 Ennis Choyce of Altadena had one of the most impressive stringers, catching 
seven catfish totaling 92 pounds 8 ounces. But everyone seems to be getting 
into the act. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldara said a seven-pounder he had soaking on a string was attacked and eaten 
by a raccoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got it at the dock and just tore that thing apart," Caldara said. "He got 
my dinner."

LOS ALAMITOS; IDAHO-BRED PROVES LURE OF SOUTHLAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STACY PIGOTT, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many good quarter horses from the Northwest have raced successfully in 
California, most recently BCR Town Jewel, who won the PCQHRA Breeders' Futurity 
at Los Alamitos on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Idaho-bred and heavily favored BCR Town Jewel easily won the $230,000 race 
in only his second California start. Under Henry Garcia, BCR Town Jewel ran 350 
yards in 17.63 seconds, finishing three-quarters of a length ahead of his 
nearest rival. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes victory was the first for BCR Town Jewel, but the gelding had 
distinguished himself in the trials for the futurity, one of the richest at Los 
Alamitos this year. BCR Town Jewel had posted the fastest qualifying time of 
17.55 seconds, winning his trial heat by more than a length in his first start 
under the lights at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 BCR Town Jewel joins a distinguished list of horses from the Northwest, 
including champion 2-year-old filly Jumping Tac Flash, Totally Illegal, Dash Ta 
Fame, Abadasher, The Plan and Short Dash, that trainer Blane Schvaneveldt has 
raced successfully in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had a lot of good horses come from up there," Schvaneveldt said. "They 
raise as good (a quality) of horses there as they do anywhere in the country." 
</P>
<P>
 Sending a horse to California can be a major gamble, considering the travel 
expenses and the increased training costs here. But for BCR Town Jewel's owner, 
Harvey Pickens, the gamble paid off. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the amount of the purses and the fact that we don't have to put up 
with the weather conditions," said Pickens, who picked up $99,000 for his 
gelding's victory. "(In Idaho), we have head winds and bad track conditions. 
It's just a crapshoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Pickens, who has been in racing for only about seven years, learned quickly 
the advantages of racing in California. Nearly every year since he brought his 
first horse in 1987, Pickens has sent a horse here. 
</P>
<P>
 One of them is Streakin Jewel, BCR Town Jewel's sire. When BCR Town Jewel won 
Saturday, he repeated what his sire had done exactly five years earlier, when 
the race was run at Fairplex Park in Pomona. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time a father and son have won the race," said Pickens, who 
still owns Streakin Jewel. 
</P>
<P>
 Schvaneveldt, an Idaho native who started his training career there before 
moving to California in the late 1960s, agrees with Pickens about the benefits 
of racing here. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Owners) run for the money, and they run for where the money is," 
Schvaneveldt said. "What attracts horses is money and purses." 
</P>
<P>
 Schvaneveldt has also seen a decrease in the number of horses being shipped 
here in recent years, despite the larger purses. 
</P>
<P>
 "They still send the good horses, but they don't send the cheaper horses 
anymore because it's too hard to make money. You can't run them enough to make 
money," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the good ones still come, as BCR Town Jewel proved with his impressive 
California debut. Given his immediate success at Los Alamitos, Pickens has 
decided to keep BCR Town Jewel here, setting his sights on the QHBC Juvenile 
Classic in December. 
</P>

<P>
 The 1995 Los Alamitos schedule remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Friday, the California Horse Racing Board approved tentative dates, 
allocating Dec. 22 through March 25, for the harness meeting, contingent on the 
successful negotiation of a lease with the owners of Los Alamitos. A quarter 
horse meeting from April 14 through Dec. 31 also was approved. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Dick Feinberg, general manager of Los Alamitos, three 
non-refundable $50,000 deposits are required from the harness group to 
negotiate a lease. The first of the three payments is due Saturday and the 
others by Oct. 15. If the first deadline is met, a signed lease is to accompany 
the payment, guaranteeing the 1994-95 harness season at Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 If a lease is not successfully negotiated, the CHRB will reconsider both the 
harness racing and quarter horse dates, taking into consideration a proposed 
harness track in Riverside County.

<P>
 The Raider special teams struggled on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 The first time the San Diego Chargers got the ball at the Coliseum, it was on 
the receiving end of a punt. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego's Darrien Gordon avoided a tackle by James Trapp, then managed to 
avoid the 10 other Raiders as he went 90 yards to the end zone in a game the 
Chargers won, 26-24. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders' special teams gave up 95 yards on three punt returns and 131 
yards on five kickoff returns, allowing San Diego good field position all 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "Special teams have always been a big part of us," Coach Art Shell said. "We 
are just not doing as well as we want to. We are letting too many people come 
through. From what I saw on film, guys are out of position. They're asked to be 
in a lane and they're not in that lane." 
</P>
<P>
 One positive came out of Sunday's performance by the special teams. Alexander 
Wright got a chance to join Rocket Ismail and Harvey Williams as kick returners 
and responded with 121 yards on three returns. Wright, a wide receiver, was 
being used primarily as a kick returner by the Dallas Cowboys when the Raiders 
got him two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defensive lineman Willie Broughton, sidelined because of an elbow injury since 
before the season, is almost ready to return. With a Raider bye this weekend, 
Broughton might be activated for the game Oct. 9 at the New England Patriots.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; FALCONS' RISON RECEIVES A CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Atlanta wide receiver Andre Rison irritated the Rams by guaranteeing, then 
delivering, a victory over them three weeks ago. But heading into Sunday's 
rematch at Anaheim Stadium, it's Ram free safety Anthony Newman firing the 
first shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, he had a big game on us but he didn't come over the middle," Newman 
said in a TV interview Monday night. "I challenge Andre to come over the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison ran short sideline patterns in the first meeting, a 31-13 Falcon 
victory, catching 12 passes for 123 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Rison hinted that the Rams had put a bounty on him and accused 
cornerback Steve Israel of taking a cheap shot at him, an accusation Israel 
denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Rison has a news conference scheduled with L.A. reporters this morning. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Falcon Coach June Jones told Atlanta writers that the Rams' 16-0 victory over 
the Chiefs, who had beaten the Falcons two weeks ago, gave his team a wake-up 
call. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing that could happen to our team was the Rams beating Kansas 
City," Jones said. "This will force use to focus for Sunday. This got our 
attention." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Flipper Anderson leads the league in yards per reception with a 
35.1 average. . . . The Falcons are tied with Kansas City for the league lead 
in take-aways with 14. They have 10 interceptions, including four by D.J. 
Johnson, who intercepted two of Ram quarterback Chris Miller's passes in the 
teams' first meeting. MIKE REILLEY

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; ROOKIE WILL START FOR THE REDSKINS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Heath Shuler, the Washington Redskins' first-round draft pick this year, will 
replace veteran John Friesz as the starter against the Dallas Cowboys on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're going to play, you may as well play against the best," Shuler said. 
"I like challenges and this is something bigger than I've ever done. But you 
don't have to get tight or nervous. You come out and play the game. Standing on 
the sidelines is not fun. The fun is when you get a chance to go out and play." 
</P>
<P>
 The Redskins are 1-3 after four games with Friesz as the starter. Friesz's 
strong showing in Game 2 at New Orleans caused Coach Norv Turner to postpone 
plans to start Shuler in the third game. 
</P>
<P>
 Shuler will become the first Redskin rookie to start at quarterback since Norm 
Snead in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Turner said he will stick with Chip Lohmiller as his kicker. The 
team tried out Cary Blanchard, formerly with the Jets, and two rookies: Todd 
Peterson of Georgia and Dirk Borgognone of Pacific. Turner said Lohmiller's job 
was in jeopardy after he missed an extra point and a 47-yard field goal Sunday 
against Atlanta. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Jerry Jones wants Jimmy Johnson to start being a journalist and quit being a 
"bitter" former coach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dallas Cowboy owner, stung by Johnson's recent criticisms of current coach 
Barry Switzer, said he hoped the NFL analyst for Fox "can keep in the 
parameters of being a journalist. I hope he can be professional and not float 
out into petty, negative comments about this football team." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said "Johnson's attitude will not affect whether we make a first down or 
fumble the ball. In my mind, what he said reinforces in my mind why he was not 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 NFL game officials ratified a new labor agreement, a seven-year contract with 
the league worth more than $70 million. The contract was approved by 70% of the 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Game pay for first- and second-year officials will go from $750 to $1,325. For 
officials with 20 or more years of service, it will increase from $2,500 to 
$4,000. Pensions will increase from $50 per month for each year of service to 
$150 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Atlanta Falcons signed kick returner Clarence Verdin and safety Brett 
Maxie and both will be available for Sunday's game against the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Verdin, a Pro Bowl player in 1990 and 1992, had 1,050 return yards for 
Indianapolis last year. Maxie, who was an unrestricted free agent, played last 
year with New Orleans. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons released kick returner Tony Smith and rookie receiver Joe Rogers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Indianapolis Colts signed former Denver and New York Giant receiver Mark 
Jackson and waived receiver Shannon Baker, who signed last year as a free agent 
and had two catches for 15 yards in limited duty this season. . . . The Buffalo 
Bills will know in three days if Thurman Thomas can play Sunday against the 
Chicago Bears. Thomas suffered an injured right knee Monday night in the Bills' 
27-20 victory over Denver. He had X-rays on Monday night that were negative and 
will not need an MRI test for soft-tissue damage. . . . Defensive end Jeff 
Hunter, signed as an unrestricted free agent after spending the last two 
seasons with Miami but slowed by a knee injury this season, was waived by the 
Tampa Bay Buccaneers. Running back Jerry Ellison was re-signed. . . . The Green 
Bay Packers signed free agent tight end Reggie Johnson and waived running back 
Darrell Thompson, a first-round draft pick in 1990. . . . San Diego Charger 
linebacker David Griggs and running back Eric Bieniemy suffered sprained knees 
in Sunday's 26-24 victory over the Raiders, but the Chargers do not play until 
Oct. 9 at home against Kansas City. . . . Jay Schroeder took most of the snaps 
with the first unit at Arizona Cardinal practice, but Buddy Ryan will not 
announce his starting quarterback for Sunday's game against the Minnesota 
Vikings until today. Steve Beuerlein and Jim McMahon are the other candidates. 
Ryan brought in free agent Mike Buck for a tryout "in case we need him."

JUDGE REJECTS RACKETEERING CHARGES AGAINST TOBACCO FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major victory for the tobacco industry, a federal judge has dismissed the 
first personal-injury class-action suit against cigarette companies brought 
under the powerful federal racketeering law. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Han, a Philip Morris Cos. spokesman who announced the ruling Tuesday, 
said the industry considers the ruling significant because the case was the 
first to test the use of the statute in tobacco litigation and the judge 
soundly rejected the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other personal-injury class-action cases are pending across the 
country, alleging that cigarette companies have conspired to conceal that 
nicotine is addictive. The recent ruling could discourage plaintiffs' lawyers 
in those suits from adding racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act is 
most commonly associated with criminal mobster and drug cases, the statute also 
allows individuals to seek treble damages against defendants in civil cases if 
a pattern of wrongdoing can be established. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs alleged that the tobacco industry violated RICO by concealing 
that smoking is addictive and by adding levels of nicotine to make sure the 
products were habit-forming. 
</P>
<P>
 However, U.S. District Judge Irma Gonzalez of San Diego ruled Sept. 21 that 
RICO cannot be used to recover expenses resulting from personal injuries. 
"Congress' intent in enacting RICO excluded civil RICO actions seeking recovery 
of expenses resulting from personal injury," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 She said that under RICO, the plaintiffs must allege injury to business or 
property and that the U.S. Supreme Court has made it clear that personal 
injuries do not fall into either category. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although plaintiffs characterize the injury as pecuniary and thus an injury 
to their property, the court is unable to ignore that the core injury alleged 
in the complaint is addiction to nicotine," she wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit was brought by 15 named plaintiffs on behalf of all individuals who 
consider themselves addicted to nicotine. 
</P>
<P>
 Defendants in the suit are Liggett Group Inc.; American Tobacco Co., a unit of 
American Brands; R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co.; U.S. Tobacco Co.; Brown & 
Williamson Tobacco Corp.; Lorillard Tobacco Co.; Hill & Knowlton Inc., a unit 
of WPP Group; Tobacco Institute Inc., and the Council for Tobacco Research.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; GOLD JUMPS, YIELDS HIT 2-YEAR HIGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Long-term bond yields shot up to 2 1/4-year highs Tuesday after the Federal 
Reserve Board decided to maintain interest rates for now. But short-term yields 
fell. 
</P>
<P>
 A nearly $4 jump in gold prices added to inflation worries among traders in 
long-term securities. Gold is often used by investors as a hedge against 
inflation prospects. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar dipped, and in the stock market, blue chips outperformed the 
broader market for the second straight session. The Dow Jones industrial 
average ended up 13.80 at 3,863.04. More stocks lost ground than gained on the 
Big Board, however, and the other exchanges were essentially flat. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movement in gold directed things," said David de Rosa, a director at 
Swiss Bank Corp. in New York. "The gold market reacted to the Fed as if there 
will be higher rates of inflation. Bonds headed for the hills and that took the 
dollar down." 
</P>
<P>
 While largely expected, the Fed news reinforced market worries that the 
central bank may be falling behind in its efforts to curb inflation, which 
gradually harms the value of securities that don't mature for many years. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists and market players had previously predicted the Fed would wait 
until at least next month to push up interest rates for the sixth time this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield of the Treasury's main 30-year bond increased to 7.84%, the highest 
close since June 23, 1992, and up from 7.79%. 
</P>
<P>
 But short-term maturities moved in the opposite direction. For example, the 
yield on the three-month bill tumbled to 4.83%. 
</P>
<P>
 Market analysts said the rush to buy Treasury bills reflected relief that 
short-term maturities would hold their value for now. The central bank targets 
short-term rates to carry out its monetary policy, and higher rates on new 
securities tend to hurt the value of already-sold investments that pay a fixed 
rate of return. 
</P>
<P>
 With all the attention on the Fed, investors largely ignored a report that 
showed unexpectedly weak consumer optimism in the economy. The Conference Board 
reported its September consumer confidence index slipped to 88.4 from 90.4 in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold and other precious metals prices surged in domestic dealings after 
falling slightly overseas. On New York's Commodity Exchange, gold for current 
delivery rose $3.70 to $398.00 per troy ounce, while the heavily traded 
December futures contract shot above the key $400 level. 
</P>
<P>
 On the Comex, silver for current delivery rose 9 cents to $5.712 per troy 
ounce. In London, silver closed at $5.64, down 2 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold mining stocks got a boost from the rise in the metal. Newmont Mining 
gained 1 to 46 3/4 and Placer Dome added 5/8 to 25 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed inaction doesn't rule out another rise in rates soon, said Michael 
Metz, a vice president at Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "The non-news is out now. But the probability is we will have a move by the 
Fed in the next month or so," Metz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of being preoccupied with rates, investors now might wonder whether 
the Fed is more fearful of an economic downfall than of future inflation, 
according to Metz. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Among economically sensitive, Dow Jones component stocks, International 
Paper rose 1 3/8 to 79, Goodyear Tire & Rubber gained 7/8 to 33, while DuPont 
rose 1/4 to 57 3/4. Alcoa rose 1 3/4 to 87 1/8 after PaineWebber upgraded the 
stock. 
</P>
<P>
 Gap dropped 3/4 to 31 3/8 in heavy trading. Traders said Wall Street analysts 
cut earnings forecasts on the retailer. 
</P>
<P>
 General Motors rose 3/4 to 47 1/2 despite a United Auto Workers strike at a 
key parts plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Baby Superstores surged to close at 34 3/4 on heavy Nasdaq volume on its first 
day of trading. The stock's initial price was 18, and it hit a high of 38 
during the session. 
</P>
<P>
 * Meanwhile in the corporate bond market, prices of Greyhound bonds plummeted 
after the company said it would delay a $4.2-million interest payment. 
Greyhound Lines Inc. said it wanted time to develop a restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
 * The drug sector was rejuvenated by Congress' abandonment of health care 
reform legislation for this year. Several pharmaceutical stocks were active on 
the NYSE including Merck, up 1 1/8 to 36; Johnson & Johnson, up 2 1/8 to 51 
1/4, and Pfizer, up 1 3/8 to 69 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nynex jumped 2 to 38 and was among the most heavily traded NYSE issues. The 
regional telephone company submitted a plan to state regulators today to cut 
basic rates in New York while freezing other higher rates for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 Long-distance companies criticized the plan, saying Nynex is using it to hold 
off potential competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 * Varying performances by stocks overseas didn't have much bearing on U.S. 
trading. Stocks stumbled in Tokyo and the European markets were mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 * The dollar plunged more than a pfennig on the German mark, reflecting some 
disappointment with the central bank's inaction. Higher U.S. rates tend to 
attract deposits in dollars and give the currency a boost. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the Japanese yen, the dollar's losses were more modest, with dealers 
reluctant to make bets in either direction amid uncertainty about the outcome 
of the stalemated U.S.-Japan trade talks.

CHRONICLING THE COMPLEXITIES OF A 'DOUBLE LIFE'; LITERATURE: LINDA WOLFE'S 
LATEST BOOK EXPLORES THE AFFAIR BETWEEN NEW YORK'S TOP JUDGE AND HIS SOCIALITE 
MISTRESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSSELL MILLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the first week back from the beach, the week of Labor Day and Rosh 
Hashanah and fall preview guides in the magazines, and for most of the New York 
literati nibbling pinky-sized duck rolls in tamarind sauce this was, as they 
happily explained, "the first book party of the season." 
</P>
<P>
 Many were friends of the honoree, Linda Wolfe. Several had even read her new 
work, "Double Life: The Shattering Affair Between Chief Judge Sol Wachtler and 
Socialite Joy Silverman" (Pocket Books). 
</P>
<P>
 Those who hadn't surely knew the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, the New York papers were filled with it. He was the powerful 
leader of the state's top court, a likely candidate for governor. She had 
raised so much money for George Bush's 1988 presidential campaign that Bush had 
nominated her, without diplomatic credentials or experience, to be ambassador 
to Barbados. (The nomination was dropped.) 
</P>
<P>
 In November, 1992, the FBI nabbed the chief judge. For months, the 
long-married Wachtler had been stalking his ex-lover, Silverman, disguising his 
voice on the phone, mailing coarse threats from distant cities, posing as a 
fat, toothless gumshoe from Houston and as an Irish Catholic housewife from New 
Jersey. 
</P>
<P>
 He pleaded guilty to threatening to kidnap Silverman's daughter and, a year 
ago, entered federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 In late August, he was moved to a halfway house in Brooklyn -- just in time 
for the release of Wolfe's book. That put Wachtler, who looks to be cruising 
toward a lucrative new career in real estate, and Silverman back in the papers. 
And with the New York Post reporting Silverman's claim that she is again 
receiving harassing calls, there was plenty to dish at the party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sol Wachtler? It was as if, in California, this happened with Gov. Brown Sr. 
He had that kind of respect, that status," commented one guest -- a New York 
City political insider who spoke freely, but "not for attribution." He said he 
knew both Sol and Joy. 
</P>
<P>
 The party, it turned out, had its own double life. Stirred in with the 
publishing familiars was a healthy spritz of figures from the drama itself. For 
them, the insider said, "maybe it's like a wake or a funeral. People laugh and 
reminisce." 
</P>
<P>
 And spin: Here was Wachtler's therapist, Dr. Sanford Solomon, praising his 
patient's recovery and blaming drugs for the chief judge's misdeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Here was Michael Chertoff, who prosecuted the case as a U.S. attorney, 
insisting that "the guy was responsible for what he did -- there is no excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 And here was Dick Simons, Joy Silverman's first husband. Deeply tan, 
silver-bearded, with a diamond stud next to the tiny gold hoop in his left ear, 
flanked by two buxom "lady friends" dripping in rhinestones, Simons piqued the 
curiosity of dowdy editorial types. He swirled his white wine and denied (as he 
does in the book) that Silverman's boudoir technique was as inspired as Sol 
Wachtler seems to have thought. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after the party, Wolfe explained her guest list: "I thought it 
would be amusing to have these people who are in the book suddenly materialize. 
How often is it that characters you read about come to life at a party?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe, a husky-voiced denizen of Manhattan's bookishly bourgeois Upper West 
Side, has been plumbing the mysteries of middle- and upper-class crime for 
nearly two decades. She set her sights on the Wachtler affair, she recalled, 
"the minute it happened." 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was my story," she said. "I felt it had my name on it. All my work 
had led up to it. And I wanted to do a book on it." 
</P>
<P>
 She started out as a graduate student in literature, not a crime reporter. In 
the late 1950s, she worked in the rarefied atmosphere of Partisan Review, New 
York's seminal intellectual journal, then moved to Time Inc., researching and 
writing. She wrote short stories as well as an anthology-cookbook called "The 
Literary Gourmet." 
</P>
<P>
 All the while, she clipped crime reports from newspapers. She thought they 
would help her to plot fiction. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1977 Wolfe had "what I will always think of, though this will sound 
callous, as the 'good fortune' of knowing somebody involved in the kind of 
story I had been clipping," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A pair of twins, both prominent gynecologists, had killed themselves. One had 
been her doctor, briefly, years before. She sold her investigation of the 
double suicide to New York magazine. Then she based a novel, "Private 
Practices," on the brothers' creepy lives, taking a pregnant patient's point of 
view. (It became the movie "Dead Ringers" starring Jeremy Irons in 1988.) 
</P>
<P>
 "But by that time," she recalled, "I had been bitten by the bug of actuality. 
From '77 on, I began concentrating on crime, real things that had happened, 
always with a deep psychological probing. I'm more interested in what went 
before and what comes after than in the actual crime itself." 
</P>
<P>
 She wrote about a mother who killed her two children, then herself. She wrote 
about an anthropologist who manufactured illegal drugs on the side. She wrote 
about a physician who disappeared, and a professor who fell in love with, then 
murdered, a prostitute. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1989, she published her first book-length crime story. "Wasted: The Preppie 
Murder" traces the grim family histories of Jennifer Levin, a bar-hopping New 
York teen-ager, and Robert Chambers, who killed her during a sexual encounter 
in Central Park. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The same attention to context characterizes "Double Life." Wolfe set out to 
investigate the newly moneyed milieu and complexly intertwined families of Sol 
Wachtler and Joy Silverman, whose story she calls, quoting a friend, "a Jewish 
'Dallas.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Dick Simons, the ex, was key to Wolfe's research. Now a Florida investor, 
Simons grew up in the same Long Island social circles as Wachtler and 
Silverman. "He was a wealth of stories," Wolfe said, "not just about Joy, but 
about the family and the story I wanted to tell: Where did these people come 
from? What made both Wachtler and Joy into the kind of greedy, ambitious people 
that they turned into?" 
</P>
<P>
 Wolfe located Simons a few months after Wachtler's arrest. Other players 
followed, including one of Wachtler's grown daughters. At last, apparently 
swayed by an earlier Wolfe piece on a manic-depressive murderer, Sol Wachtler 
and his wife, Joan, agreed to talk. Wachtler brought along piles of material 
relating to his case. 
</P>
<P>
 The interviews, in July, 1993, came between his guilty plea and sentencing, 
just before what Wolfe, in "Double Life," calls "an enormous publicity 
campaign." Wachtler spent that summer telling reporters how mental illness and 
sexual victimhood had driven him to outrageous revenge. (Now, his psychiatrist 
told book-party guests, Wachtler is planning a book, a judge's look at prison 
from within.) 
</P>
<P>
 Silverman, on the other hand, declined to be interviewed. Wolfe had expected 
to write a book sympathetic to her. "I had once been stalked by an ex-lover and 
it was a very, very scary experience," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She based her depiction of Silverman's experience largely on talks with 
Michael Chertoff, who as a U.S. attorney argued her case. "He was like a voice 
for her," Wolfe said. Even so, while her Wachtler is a criminal conundrum, her 
Silverman is a vindictive, voracious shrew seducing the sexually innocent 
jurist with "a panoply of pleasures." 
</P>
<P>
 New York tabloids have reported that Silverman kept mum because she thought 
she could sell her own book. At the "Double Life" party, the political insider 
called her silence a tactical flub. 
</P>
<P>
 "Joy," he said, "has not made an affirmative defense. Sol, although shattered 
or embarrassed, has consistently gotten out his point of view. Like the O.J. 
Simpson trial, it's a P.R. war -- and she hasn't kept up her end." 
</P>
<P>
 But with "Double Life" in bookstores, and with secondary characters helping 
Pocket Books out by doing interviews, Silverman has consented to sit with a 
reporter from the New Yorker, Lucinda Franks. Conspiracy theorists at the party 
made much of the fact that Franks is married to Manhattan Dist. Atty. Robert 
Morgenthau. (His office declined to comment.) 
</P>
<P>
 In her prologue, Wolfe muses that Sol Wachtler's crimes make one wonder "how 
one could ever again trust one's judgment of one's fellows." 
</P>
<P>
 At the party, book and television critic John Leonard said: "As much as 
Linda's gotten of Wachtler, as much as he cooperated, I still didn't 
understand."

BOOK REVIEW / NONFICTION; RODEO RIDERS BUCK THE ODDS, LIVE A DREAM; BITING THE 
DUST: THE WILD RIDE AND DARK ROMANCE OF THE RODEO COWBOY AND THE AMERICAN WEST 
BY DIRK JOHNSON ; SIMON & SCHUSTER $22, 240 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN KIRSCH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cowboys disappeared into the realm of myth and matinees long ago, but Dirk 
Johnson has searched out an odd corner of the popular culture where real live 
cowboys can still be found -- the rodeo, which Johnson describes in "Biting the 
Dust" as "the world where the Old West still lives, the last untamed range of 
the true American cowboy." 
</P>
<P>
 "In the ceaseless moaning wind, swirling with old ghosts and faded dreams, 
there is a whisper of the survivor on the Great Plains, the soul of the 
defiant," Johnson writes in a characteristic burst of charged-up prose. "And 
when the rodeo comes to town, the whisper becomes a roar. We're still here." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson introduces us to the North American rodeo circuit, a curious pocket of 
professional sports where young men (and the occasional young woman) who know 
how to rope and ride and wrangle compete for modest prizes at the risk of life 
and limb. A year on the circuit might take a cowboy down a hundred thousand 
miles of road to a hundred rodeos, but he's lucky if he can make a living at 
all. 
</P>
<P>
 "A rodeo cowboy can become a star and never earn more than $50,000 a year 
before expenses," the author explains. "Some of the sport's biggest celebrities 
live in house trailers." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, it's the enduring and irresistible appeal of the cowboy myth that 
explains why the young men in "Biting the Dust" -- Joe and Ty and Bud and 
Clint, among others -- have taken up saddle and spurs in the age of the 
Information Superhighway. And Johnson himself unabashedly celebrates the rodeo 
rider as an embodiment of the loftiest elements of the cowboy ethos: courage, 
honor, a stoic reserve and a kind of chivalry. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no trash-talking among contestants in a rodeo," writes Johnson. "The 
guy in the next chute might also be a travel partner later that night. And if 
he wins the check, he might also buy dinner." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson may indulge in a bit of hero worship, but he does not pretty up the 
life of a rodeo cowboy. The risks of injury and bankruptcy are about the same; 
the pay-off, if it ever comes, is meager; and the contemporary rodeo cowboy 
must cope not only with raging bulls and bucking broncos but also 
bill-collectors and animal-rights activists: "Say No to Rodeo" is the legend on 
one picket sign spotted at a Denver rodeo. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson is the Denver bureau chief of the New York Times, and he takes good 
notes -- his book is full of colorful lore, ranging from the lineage of a rodeo 
horse to the unique design of a rodeo saddle to the proper technique for sizing 
up a bronco in the last moments before the chute opens and the horse tries its 
best to kill its rider. 
</P>
<P>
 But the author also aspires toward something grander than journalism, and 
"Biting the Dust" is alternately rendered in the lush tones of an old-fashioned 
travelogue ("Rodeo drapes itself in Americana, the legacy of the Old West, the 
triumph of God-fearing settlers") and in the clipped phrases of a John Wayne 
movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to be free," says one young man who quits "the eight-to-four factory 
trap" to hit the road as a rodeo cowboy. "Don't want no boss. Don't want nobody 
tellin' me what to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the most telling facts of the cowboy life is the grueling itinerary of 
the circuit riders as they hustle from rodeo to rodeo across the western half 
of America: Denver and Fort Worth and Las Vegas, but also the cow towns and 
backwaters and whistle-stops of the American heartland. At moments, we see that 
a rodeo rider more nearly resembles a long-haul trucker or a ballplayer in the 
minor leagues, even if Johnson insists on portraying him as a knight errant. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's hard to resist the notion that these young men have tapped into some 
wellspring of American consciousness and connected with an authentic source of 
America's image of itself. That's what makes "Biting the Dust" into something 
more than yet another reprise of the cowboy myth.

DANA PARSONS: RIGHT FAMILY IS A MUST FOR A BOY DONE AWFULLY WRONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Dana Parsons 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He's still the 10-year-old boy whose name we don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope we never know it. Let's hope he becomes an anonymous kid who likes 
school and sports and hanging out with his friends and that he then transforms 
into an anonymous adult with a job and a family and a lawn to mow. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope we don't read about him in five, 10 or 20 years when the product of 
his anger and hostility and mistrust spills out into some violent antisocial 
act. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's hope (and throw in a prayer too) that some governor of California in the 
21st Century doesn't have a request with the kid's name on it -- a request to 
commute a scheduled date with the gas chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm not trying to sensationalize. Anyone reading the newspapers in Orange 
County these days knows about the 10-year-old boy who has been in protective 
custody after allegations surfaced that the aunt who was taking care of him 
physically abused him with a heated knife and sexually abused him with a 
souvenir baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the deck has been stacked against this 10-year-old. I remember how, 
before the 1992 execution of Robert Alton Harris, psychiatrists noted that the 
convicted murderer was a victim of fetal alcohol syndrome and also was beaten 
as a child. 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, no one can predict what will happen to this 10-year-old now, and 
it's a good thing for all of us that not every abused child ends up on Death 
Row. But for now the deck is stacked. The Orange County Probation Department, 
in identifying factors that characterize its most troublesome youth offenders, 
lists "child abuse or neglect" among them. 
</P>
<P>
 Ira Gorman is a family and child psychologist with a practice in Santa Ana. 
He's not involved in the 10-year-old's case, but I asked Gorman if he could 
make general observations about the potential effect of such abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "In general, there would be greater distrust for adults and authority," Gorman 
said. "He would have difficulty getting close to other people, he'd probably be 
more guarded and one can anticipate he would have interpersonal relationship 
problems." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, males who are abused as children often use aggression to handle 
problems as adults and often repeat abusive behavior as parents. 
</P>
<P>
 As for potential criminal behavior, Gorman said that the likelihood of 
delinquency rises when dysfunctional families are involved. The boy's 
intelligence level and success in school will play a key role, Gorman said, 
"but in general, people who are raised in dysfunctional settings tend to become 
dysfunctional adolescents and adults, and you'll find that prisons are 
populated with individuals who are raised in abusive, dysfunctional and 
neglectful homes." 
</P>
<P>
 In the midst of that gloomy scenario is a beckoning light, Gorman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "With the right home and the right substitute parents, he could improve 
significantly," Gorman said. "It's only bleak if he goes from foster home to 
foster home and doesn't get into a situation where his substitute parent is 
sophisticated and loving." 
</P>
<P>
 Therapy is great, Gorman said, but not more so than a stable home environment. 
"There's always been therapy, but it goes right back to the type of setting he 
goes into." 
</P>
<P>
 The good news is that there are plenty of capable substitute parents, Gorman 
said. The bad news is that they aren't always matched with the children who 
need them. 
</P>
<P>
 For the 10-year-old now in the news, another hopeful note comes from Bruce 
Malloy, head of the county's Juvenile Justice Commission and a former probation 
officer. Malloy is well aware of the cycle of child abuse and its potential 
link to criminal behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 However, he said, public awareness of the effects of child abuse have led to 
increased efforts to help children like the 10-year-old boy. "The likelihood 
that he might wind up with these problems later in life is less today than if 
this had happened 10 or 15 years ago," Malloy said. "I don't think you'll see 
this boy in this category (of being a future abuser)," he said. "Not with the 
help he's getting now." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, authorities found him a temporary foster home. It's a start, but 
this boy has many, many miles to walk before he rests. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows where the boy will wind up. His father and his grandmother both 
say they want custody. 
</P>
<P>
 In a figurative sense, good foster parents can "save" the life of any child 
they receive. 
</P>
<P>
 In this 10-year-old's case, where the abuse is not likely to fade from memory 
quickly, it would be stretching the point only a little to suggest the right 
family could be saving someone else's too. 
</P>

 A discussion of Proposition 187, the initiative that would cut government 
benefits for undocumented immigrants, will take place at Chapman University 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 The forum, called "Immigration: Where Are We Headed?" is sponsored by the 
university's Latino Heritage Committee and Associated Students. 
</P>
<P>
 Speakers include Nativo Lopez, of Hermandad Mexicana; Eddie Hernandez, 
executive vice chancellor of Rancho Santiago College, and Chapman University 
President James L. Doti, who will talk about economic aspects of immigration. 
Proposition 187 organizers declined to participate in the discussion, according 
to Sharon Frey, president of Macondo, a Latino student group. 
</P>
<P>
 "After the panelists speak, we plan to have an open discussion and debate with 
the audience," Frey said. "People are welcome to give their point of view." 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming discussions in the Latino Heritage Month forum series include 
"Political Empowerment" on Oct. 5, and "Latinos and Health Care Reform" on Oct. 
12. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the free panel discussions will be held at 7 p.m. in Room 208 of the 
Argyros Forum, on the Chapman University campus. For information, call (714)

ROOKIE DUCK DEFENSEMAN TSULYGIN WILL RETURN TO HIS RUSSIAN TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As expected, rookie defenseman Nikolai Tsulygin will return to Russia to begin 
the season with the Central Red Army team, Mighty Duck General Manager Jack 
Ferreira said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks also assigned surprising center Steve Rucchin and veteran goaltender 
Allan Bester to San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsulygin, 19, will be the first Duck to play for the Central Red Army team 
since a joint operating agreement with the Pittsburgh Penguins was announced 
last summer. Tsulygin, the Ducks' second-round pick in the 1993 draft, played 
in five exhibition games, scoring his first goal in a 3-2 loss to Pittsburgh on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Rucchin signed with San Diego and is expected to sign with the Ducks when the 
current labor talks are resolved. He still would probably be assigned to play 
in San Diego, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Rucchin, selected in the 1994 supplemental draft, made a believer out of Coach 
Ron Wilson in training camp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Steve is going to go to San Diego, but we know he can play," Wilson said. 
"He's been a pleasant surprise." 
</P>
<P>
 Bester, who played 46 games for the Gulls and was the starter for the Western 
Conference in the IHL All-Star game last season, started in Sunday's loss to 
Pittsburgh. He replaced Guy Hebert, who returned to Troy, N.Y., to attend to a 
family medical emergency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tim Sweeney, the Ducks' fourth-leading scorer with 43 points last season, was 
one of five players left unprotected for today's waiver draft. The Ducks also 
left Bester, Dean Ewen, Mark Ferner and Jim Thomson unprotected. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweeney appears to be caught in a logjam at left wing, playing behind Paul 
Kariya, Garry Valk, Patrik Carnback and Stu Grimson. He had two assists in four 
exhibition games. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks and Maple Leafs are involved in talks regarding forward David Sacco 
-- a U.S. Olympian and the brother of Duck forward Joe Sacco -- perhaps coming 
in a major deal that would send Terry Yake to Toronto, according to a source in 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Yake was the Ducks' leading scorer last season with 52 points, but has fallen 
to fifth on the depth chart at right wing during camp. The Ducks' confidence in 
rookies Valeri Karpov and John Lilley could make Yake expendable. David Sacco, 
24, played at Boston University and was recently assigned to St. John's 
(Newfoundland) in the American Hockey League. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Defenseman Don McSween hopes to resume skating today after suffering a pulled 
groin in a 4-4 tie with Dallas Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to let it heal up," said McSween, who secured a spot on the roster 
with a solid performance in his first training camp with the Ducks. "I didn't 
want it to turn into a chronic thing." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Todd Ewen on being named one of the 100 coolest people in L.A. by Buzz 
magazine: 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm on the same page as James Garner. That's pretty cool. I'm right there 
with 'The Rockford Files.' That's phenomenal. I'm basically a Popular 
Mechanics, Popular Science kind of guy."

valuable player. The Knights won all 11 games, including a 15-13 victory over 
St. Bonaventure in the final. "She really is our best offensive weapon and our 
go-to person," Coach Sue Newcomb said. "Darcie and Tunde have helped us to more 
success than we thought we'd have."

SIDELINES; WITH TURNOVER ON RETURN, CRESPI CAN'T HOLD ONTO ITS CUSHION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lost: one goal-post pad. Four-feet tall, vinyl-covered, brown-and-gold, 
"Crespi" emblazoned in vertical lettering. Last seen traveling eastbound on the 
Ventura Freeway on the evening of Friday, Sept. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 If found, please return to Andy Gavel, athletic director at Crespi High. 
Reward: two tickets to a Crespi home game. 
</P>
<P>
 It's no joke. The Crespi athletic department is missing one of the protective 
cushions that fit around the bottom of a goal post. Gavel would like to have 
the pad in place in time for Friday night's nonleague showdown with Notre Dame 
at Pierce College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It must have bounced out of the back of our equipment truck on the way home 
from the Taft game," Gavel said. "Our equipment manager didn't notice it was 
missing until we got back." 
</P>
<P>
 Never mind the pad. Did anyone count the helmets? 
</P>
<P>
 Best-laid plans: After Jill Gallegos scored four goals in the first half of 
Cal Lutheran's soccer match Saturday against Whittier, she was removed from the 
lineup by coaches sensing an easy victory. No use risking injury, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 But later Gallegos and a few teammates persuaded Coach Dan Kuntz to put her 
back in the game so she might take aim at the school record of five goals. 
About 10 minutes after Gallegos returned, she scored. About 10 minutes after 
that, she hurt her ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put this girl on me and she just kept kicking my ankles," Gallegos said. 
"I guess that's exactly what they were trying to prevent." 
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran defeated Whittier, 8-0. The next day Gallegos, playing injured, 
was held scoreless as the Regals downed Cal Poly Pomona, 2-0. By Tuesday, she 
was feeling better -- and a little wiser for the experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Doubt full: With the name Robert Burt, perhaps redundancy is a birthright. 
</P>
<P>
 Burt, the Cal State Northridge football coach, waxed repetitive in this week's 
press release regarding Saturday's home game against Cal State Chico: "We have 
to come back and be ready to play and start winning football games that are in 
doubt. We need to start winning football games that are in doubt, and not just 
lose the ones that are in doubt and win the ones that we dominate." 
</P>
<P>
 Go back and read that again. Slooowly.  
</P>
<P>
 Soft-drink challenge: Littlerock High football Coach Jim Bauer has concocted a 
way to spice up the end of Wednesday practices. 
</P>
<P>
 First, Bauer breaks his team into offensive and defensive groups, then he 
gives the offense four plays to try to score from the eight-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 If the offense reaches the end zone, those players get a soda. If the defense 
holds, those players get the drink. 
</P>
<P>
 No big deal you say? Go watch. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would think these kids are playing for the Super Bowl," Bauer said. 
"They're going all out for a can of soda that costs maybe thirty cents." 
Quotebook 
</P>
<P>
 In 1986, Bill Redell guided Crespi High and star tailback Russell White to a 
Southern Section Big Five Conference championship. But last season Redell was 
3-7 in his debut as St. Francis coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to be famous," Redell said. "Now, I'm a bum." 
</P>
<P>
 Not any more. The Golden Knights are 2-0-1 this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Double jeopardy: The answer, from Phil McCune, Ventura High football coach: 
"Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 The question: After losing to Westlake and Royal in consecutive weeks, are you 
concerned or just chalking the losses up to good competition? 
</P>
<P>
 McCune doesn't waste words. Stats 
</P>
<P>
 Hoover's 16-0 victory over Grant Friday was the Tornadoes' first in 19 games, 
dating to Oct. 2, 1992. During its skid Hoover was outscored, 621-225, and 
suffered lopsided losses to Arcadia (31-0), Crescenta Valley (46-0), Muir 
(24-0), Burbank (28-0), La Canada (41-12) and Glendale (49-7). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's history now," Coach Dennis Hughes said of the streak. Fast fact: Hoover 
has not won consecutive games since the start of the 1990 season. 
</P>
<P>
 Double trouble: Two compelling reasons why Sylmar High is the top-ranked 
football team in the area: Among area City Section schools, the Spartans have 
the most productive offense (346.7 yards a game) and the stingiest defense 
(132.7), each more than 20 yards better than that of the next closest team. 
</P>
<P>
 Half right: Both passes Oxnard High quarterback Taj Lewis attempted last 
Friday went for touchdowns. One went to his intended receiver, David Cameron. 
The other was picked off by Chris Heffernan of Channel Islands, who returned it 
37 yards for a score. 
</P>
<P>
 Frequent flier: Cal State Northridge ranks seventh among NCAA Division I-AA 
passing offenses, averaging 311 yards a game. Quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin is 
10th in the nation in total offense (301 yards) and 23rd in passing efficiency 
(140.1). Junior tight end Travis Hall is tied for 15th with an average of six 
receptions a game. 
</P>

 Give and take: The Cal Lutheran football team leads the Southern California 
Intercollegiate Athletic Conference with seven take-aways and eight turnovers. 
Honors 
</P>
<P>
 A 224-yard effort against the University of San Diego on Saturday night earned 
Cal Lutheran running back Terrence Thomas SCIAC offensive player of the week 
honors. Thomas leads the conference with 349 yards in two games. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice as nice: Northridge quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin, who passed for a 
career-high 358 yards in last week's 28-23 loss to Southwest Texas State, was 
selected American West Conference offensive player of the week. Northridge's 
DeWayne Johnson, a freshman from Reseda High, blocked a punt and was named the 
special-teams player of the week.

PRO FOOTBALL DAILY REPORT; RAMS; FALCONS' RISON RECEIVES A CHALLENGE 
</P>

 Atlanta wide receiver Andre Rison irritated the Rams by guaranteeing, then 
delivering a victory over them three weeks ago. But heading into Sunday's 
rematch at Anaheim Stadium, it's Ram free safety Anthony Newman firing the 
first shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, he had a big game on us," Newman said in a live TV interview Monday 
night, "but he didn't come over the middle. I challenge Andre to come over the 
middle." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison ran short sideline patterns in the first meeting, a 31-13 Falcon 
victory. He caught 12 passes for 123 yards and two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Rison hinted that the Rams had put a bounty on him and said 
cornerback Steve Israel took a cheap shot at him, an accusation Israel denied. 
</P>
<P>
 Stay tuned. Rison has a news conference scheduled with L.A. reporters this 
morning. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Falcon Coach June Jones told Atlanta reporters that the Rams' 16-0 victory 
over the Chiefs, who had beaten the Falcons two weeks ago, gave his team a 
wake-up call heading into Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing that could happen to our team was the Rams beating Kansas 
City," Jones said. "This will force use to focus for Sunday. This got our 
attention." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Wide receiver Flipper Anderson leads the league in yards per reception with a 
35.1 average. . . . Examples of the Rams' improved special-teams play this 
season: The average field position for opponents is the 26-yard line, second in 
the NFC to Arizona opponents (24.9). Punter Sean Landeta was named the NFC's 
special teams player of the week after averaging 52.5 yards, tying a Ram 
single-game record, in Sunday's victory. 
</P>
<P>
 In hopes of boosting its special teams, Atlanta cut return man Tony Smith, a 
1992 first-round draft pick who had been slowed by a knee injury, and signed 
former Indianapolis return man Clarence Verdin. . . . The Falcons are tied with 
Kansas City for the league lead in takeaways with 14. They have 10 
interceptions, including four by D.J. Johnson, who intercepted two of Ram 
quarterback Chris Miller's passes in the teams' first meeting. MIKE REILLEY

STREET BEAT: THE FIGHT AGAINST CRIME: NOTES FROM THE FRONT; POLICE STATION 
PREGNANT WITH ESPRIT DE CORPS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEANNETTE REGALADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It takes a determined effort to make some things work together well: 
Democratic presidents and Republican senators, stripes and plaid. To that list, 
you might add police officers and pregnancy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (other officers) just joke around with us. The other day the sergeant was 
saying, 'Can you believe this?' when I was having contractions in the station. 
I think they are very nervous that I might go into labor on duty," Officer 
Kristin Traynor said recently. Not without reason -- by the time this column 
was written, she actually was in labor. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, four officers at the LAPD's Devonshire Division station were pregnant 
recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Traynor and Officer Ingrid Langrehr gave birth within the last week, 
all four could be found huddled in the locker room or hallway of the station, 
speaking in hushed voices about the impending births. 
</P>
<P>
 "Did you feel this?" 
</P>
<P>
 "What did your doctor say?" 
</P>
<P>
 A male officer walked by and asked, "Talking about babies again?" 
</P>
<P>
 They answered, "Of course." 
</P>
<P>
 And as the hardships of war brought men together in the past, pregnancy in 
police uniform has become a female bonding experience, adding to the 
traditional cop camaraderie the mutual experience of changes in their bodies 
and changes on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Professionally, after submitting confirmation from a doctor that they are 
pregnant, they are put on light duty, meaning a desk job. Other LAPD rules 
require that they no longer make arrests, wear their equipment belt or carry a 
gun. 
</P>
<P>
 As their bodies grow with new life, they must alter their uniforms, spending 
$60 on a pair of uniform pants and adding expandable spandex panels. They 
replace uniform shirts with larger ones borrowed from male officers and wear 
them untucked. Traynor has been borrowing a uniform from her husband, a fellow 
officer in the CRASH anti-gang unit whom she met at the Police Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they are allowed a four-month unpaid maternity leave, women officers 
and department executives say that most pregnant officers keep working and save 
up sick time -- 12 days a year -- and vacation time, which can accumulate to 
about a month, to have more paid time off after the baby is born. Otherwise, 
they would have to be back on the job as soon as a doctor declared them fit to 
return to work to continue collecting a paycheck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We all plan on working until the end," said Officer Terri Meiss, who is due 
Nov. 4. "If we save our sick time and vacation time, we can take off. We have 
no paid maternity leave." 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Maureen Geller, due in early December, said it would be nice to take 
some weeks off before the birth "to shop and just prepare like other mothers," 
but to spend paid time with the baby after it's born, she has to "work up until 
the last day possible." 
</P>
<P>
 The change from an active officer on the street to a patient desk officer is 
not as easy as it sounds, some say. 
</P>
<P>
 "Working the desk is more stressful," said Meiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to deal with the phones and you are on your feet all day," Meiss 
said. "It is very stressful and your patience goes out the window, especially 
when you are pregnant." 
</P>
<P>
 Geller doesn't have it so bad. "I am spoiled rotten here. They take care of me 
and make sure I have eaten and I am happy," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes they ask me if I am having light cramps," she said with a laugh. 
"They love me here." 
</P>
<P>
 But there's no escaping cop humor. Traynor said her co-workers teased her by 
appearing with rubber gloves and the kit that ambulance attendants carry to 
assist at births. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came out with the gloves on and the kit and I was laughing, saying 
'You're not coming near me,' " she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she gave birth, Traynor said she actually felt more at ease at the 
station because it was closer to her hospital. But the last few days at work 
took a toll. "I feel myself getting tired," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other officers always say, 'Why are you still here?' and I say it's 
because I want to take the time off afterwards with full pay," she explained. 
"I want to have a few months at home."

FEHR AND PLAYERS AGREE ON ISSUES; BASEBALL: KARROS ACCUSES OWNERS OF FAILING TO 
NEGOTIATE WITH THEM IN GOOD FAITH. PIAZZA SEES THE 1995 SEASON BEING IN 
JEOPARDY. 
</P>

<P>
 As Congress continued to prepare legislation aimed at ending baseball's labor 
stalemate, Donald Fehr, executive director of the players' union, met for more 
than three hours Tuesday with 77 players based in Southern California. He said 
later he had found the same "anger and cold resolve" in reaction to the impasse 
that he has found on previous stops during a cross-country tour designed to 
update players. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Karros and Mike Piazza of the Dodgers supported Fehr's perception after 
the meeting at an airport-area hotel, the fifth of eight stops for Fehr, who 
also will meet with players in Phoenix, Dallas and the Caribbean area. 
</P>
<P>
 Karros, the Dodgers' first baseman, said the mood is one of "anger and 
frustration because the owners have refused to take us seriously or bargain in 
good faith," failing to budge from the salary-cap proposal that the union 
expects the owners to implement unilaterally before Nov. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We belong on the field, and the longer this goes the stronger and more united 
we become," Karros said. 
</P>
<P>
 Piazza agreed, saying it was disappointing not to be taken seriously, and 
unless there is an agreement without a salary cap before the start of the 1995 
season, "we'll all be watching a lot of college baseball next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr and the players expressed confidence in the union's solidarity if the 
owners open camps next spring and try to use minor leaguers as replacements 
with the hope some striking major leaguers will also cross the picket lines. 
</P>
<P>
 'Scabs aren't looked on very pleasantly," Dodger pitcher Tom Candiotti said. 
"What do you think the reaction will be to any kid who crossed the line?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, there were these developments in Washington: 
</P>
<P>
 -- The House subcommittee on economic and commercial law might vote today on a 
bill by Mike Synar (D-Okla.) that would repeal baseball's antitrust exemption 
as it applies to labor relations. If passed by the subcommittee, the full 
Judiciary Committee might vote on it Thursday, but it remains unlikely that 
Congress, which adjourns next month, could act before reconvening in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr reiterated that the strike would end if the exemption were repealed, but 
only if language that prevented a salary cap from taking effect until any 
lawsuits stemming from implementation were resolved remains in the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Management sources said that they did not think that language, heavily in 
favor of the union and a subject of debate during a hearing at which Fehr and 
acting commissioner Bud Selig testified last week, would remain part of it. 
Selig said Tuesday that he had heard there were changes being made "but I don't 
know what the makeup is yet." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sen. Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio) has introduced legislation similar to the 
Synar bill and said he hopes to force it to a vote today as part of an 
appropriations bill for the Labor and Health departments. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Ohio), a co-sponsor of the bill, said that all he and 
Metzenbaum "are trying to do is say to the owners of those teams: You can 
unilaterally impose, if you want to, any unilateral conditions under the law, 
but if you do, you lose the antitrust exemption until after the matter is 
resolved. I do think it will end the strike. I do think it will push the sides 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 -- The House subcommittee on labor-management relations will conduct a hearing 
Thursday to consider a bill by Rep. Pat Williams (D-Mont.) that would impose 
binding arbitration if the owners and players fail to reach an agreement by 
Feb. 1. Orel Hershiser of the Dodgers, union counsel Eugene Orza and owners' 
negotiator Richard Ravitch are expected to testify. 
</P>
<P>
 Fehr said he would be open to binding arbitration. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under these circumstances, I think you have to consider everything," he said, 
adding that he was appreciative of the growing interest and involvement by 
Congress and that "some congressmen definitely seem to recognize" that it's 
going to take their involvement to get the owners moving toward meaningful 
negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if a majority (of congressmen) feel that way, but we seem to be 
picking up momentum all the time," Fehr said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Milwaukee, Selig said he would soon appoint an operations 
committee that will work with Ravitch to determine how the owners proceed and 
under which rules the clubs will operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig wouldn't identify the committee members, but it was learned that Bob 
Graziano, the Dodgers' vice president of finance, is expected to be a member. 
</P>
<P>
 Also expected to be on the committee are Boston Red Sox CEO John Harrington, 
Montreal Expo president Claude Brochu, Oakland Athletics General Manager Sandy 
Alderson, Florida Marlin General Manager Dave Dombrowski and Philadelphia 
Phillie executive vice president David Montgomery.

THE GOOD DOCTOR WIELDS A BIG BAT; SOFTBALL STAR DOT RICHARDSON STILL IS IN THE 
HUNT TO BECOME A SURGEON AND AN OLYMPIC GOLD MEDAL WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Dot Richardson retire from softball? For anybody who knows her, it's hard 
enough imagining Richardson ever being tired, let alone re -tired. 
</P>
<P>
 "This young lady has energy beyond my capacity to understand," said Dr. 
Francis Schiller, the associate director of the Los Angeles County-USC Medical 
Center's orthopedic residency program, in which Richardson is a second-year 
resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to meet her to see. I don't know how to describe it other than she 
bubbles. She has energy, both mentally and physically, that is well beyond the 
high average." 
</P>
<P>
 But, truth is, Richardson, who is considered one of the best women softball 
players in the world and probably will start at shortstop when the U.S. team 
plays in the 1996 Olympics, was ready to retire not long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 She was hip deep into her career as a doctor and facing 36-hour rotations in 
her chosen field, orthopedic surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was prepared to not play any longer," Richardson said. "In fact, when I was 
in medical school, I was thinking, 'This is it.' I'd been to the Pan American 
Games -- softball wasn't in the Olympics -- been all over the world playing 
softball, and I was prepared. 'OK, I've gone the farthest I could go." 
</P>
<P>
 What changed her mind? First, the International Olympic Committee made 
softball, which it had kicked out of the Barcelona Games as a demonstration 
sport, a full-fledged medal sport for the first time in the 1996 Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when she was interviewing for an orthopedic residency, she let it be 
known that she hoped to pursue the Olympic dream if it was OK with the 
hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out for sure that they had accepted softball as a medal sport a week 
before I turned in my residency match list," Richardson said. "When I was 
turning it in, I was like, 'Well, I'm going to have to give up this dream. I 
don't know if I'm going to be able to do it.' 
</P>
<P>
 "(During the interview process) I told them I am willing to not go to the 
Olympics if it means losing my position, but I'm hoping that you realize how 
important it is to achieve my dream for an Olympic gold medal. And if you would 
like an Olympian for your residency program, I'd be more than willing to be 
that person. 
</P>
<P>
 "And they have been very supportive so far. I would have to say that everyone 
I've worked with, I can't praise enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Richardson has been shuttling frantically between her medical 
career, which demands 80-100 hours a week, and her other career. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, a former UCLA standout, also happens to be the leading candidate 
to bat leadoff and play shortstop for the U.S. team. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have just been falling into place," Richardson said. "It's been tough, 
very tough. I've been super tired at times, jumping on jets and flying across 
the country on weekends during medical school, sometimes during rotations here 
. . .  
</P>
<P>
 "But to do this, you're pretty committed. I feel I'm pretty committed to both 
medicine and softball. I don't know if you can understand, it's not just 
playing in a game now. It's demonstrating to the world how good softball can 
be, played by top players. That's something special." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller says that, although the medical center wasn't originally aware of how 
high a level Richardson had reached athletically, the hospital encourages its 
residents to be well rounded, even though it knows the rigors of the resident 
program can be wearying to anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she can do it and if we can work out the schedule, we're very supportive 
of it," Schiller said. "And her fellow residents have been very supportive of 
this. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't seem to bog her down at all. She just goes and goes." 
</P>
<P>
 Schiller said he considers Richardson a prime candidate to move on to a 
one-year fellowship in orthopedic surgery after her five-year residency program 
is completed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm amazed she can do it," said John Kumar, a senior orthopedic resident. "I 
mean, the difficulty of putting in 80-100 hours a week, trying to balance the 
rest of the schedule, then go home and try to read and learn about surgeries 
she's trying to do, as well as put in the time she needs to be an athlete . . . 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a hard time dealing with what I need to do and I am nowhere near as 
involved in athletics." 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson, who has begun assisting in surgery, manages her time -- and her 
vacation schedule -- with long foresight and sharp precision. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, to get the time off required to play in the Atlanta Games, 
Richardson has to plan her vacation schedules for the next four years. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe there is a way," she said. "I may be able to take one of my 
vacations for '97 and move it down and take my vacation in '95 and move it to 
the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "This way I can take vacation time for May, June and July of '96, which I 
believe is the requirement for the Olympic team." 
</P>
<P>
 When Richardson, who has been to three World Championship tournaments and 
three Pan American Games, has to take time off to play in various tournaments, 
she has to make sure her shift is covered by another resident. 
</P>
<P>
 On returning, Richardson owes time not only to the other resident, but to the 
residency program, in which participants must spend specific amounts of time in 
various areas. Leave for one week, work two weeks to make up. 
</P>
<P>
 Why do all this? 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout my career, people have been telling me I was in the wrong sport, 
'Your sport will never be accepted in the Olympics,' " Richardson said. "And 
finally, when I was willing to say goodby, whammo! It's just sitting there for 
me if I can just hang on a little longer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the level of competition that it's at when it reaches the Olympic 
level and that is the way I'd love to go out -- with an Olympic gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Wouldn't that be awesome? I get chills just thinking about it. It just seems 
so close now." 
</P>
<P>
 She recently led the U.S. team to its third gold medal in the World 
Championships at Newfoundland, Canada, leading the team with a .394 batting 
average. She also has been chosen for the 1995 U.S, team for the Pan Am Games 
next March in Argentina, and might be the only woman ever to have a 
signature-model bat endorsement. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson was 13 when she began playing women's major softball, the youngest 
person ever to play in that league. Back then, playing for the United States in 
an Olympics was a distant dream. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was playing then, in 1975, they talked about it getting into the 
Olympics, but it never happened," Richardson said. "That's why I had to keep 
pursuing an education. Softball helped pay for UCLA undergrad and everything 
else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt like I loved working with people, with anatomy, so everything directed 
me to being a physician. I just kept pursuing it." 
</P>
<P>
 And pursuing softball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just met (an acquaintance) in radiology and she recognized me from UCLA 
undergrad," Richardson said. "She's asking me, 'Are you still playing?' She had 
to give it up. Her coach gave her an ultimatum -- either quit the team or 
medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very fortunate I never had that ultimatum. I've just never been faced 
with that, knock on wood. Most people realize how important it is, and how 
close I am, to achieving that dream."

PROSPECTS ARE DIM FOR AVOIDING DELAY; HOCKEY: LATEST PROPOSAL BY NHL FAILS TO 
SPARK ANY HINT OF AGREEMENT, INCREASING CHANCE THAT SEASON'S START WILL BE 
POSTPONED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Prospects that the NHL season will start as scheduled on Saturday grew 
increasingly dim Tuesday, after players scorned a new proposal introduced by 
the league during an eight-hour bargaining session in Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Central to the new proposal is a major reduction in the rate of the "luxury 
tax" that would be paid by teams whose payrolls exceed a negotiated, 
predetermined amount. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL's plan initially called for a levy of 100% on the first 10% above the 
limit and a 200% levy on anything above that. The new plan calls for a far 
lower rate, although the exact percentage was not immediately revealed. 
Proceeds of the levy would be pooled and disbursed to help the league's weaker 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have moved considerably," a management source said after the meeting, 
which concluded 13 hours of talks over two days. "They're not moving." 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Goodenow, executive director of the NHL Players Assn., stopped short of 
rejecting the new plan but offered little hope of accepting it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The proposal they have is unacceptable," Goodenow said. "In essence, it caps 
salaries and that is a big problem for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Another source said Tuesday's session generated a cloud of pessimism and 
added, "There won't be any hockey on Saturday." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Gary Bettman announced last Thursday that he would indefinitely 
postpone the start of the season unless a new collective bargaining agreement 
could be reached. He will inform clubs Friday, probably in the morning to 
accommodate those scheduled to fly long distances, whether to stay home or 
proceed with their travel plans. Twelve games are scheduled for Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow is expected to formally respond today or Thursday. In objecting to 
the NHL's first levy system, Goodenow said it would make the costs of signing 
players prohibitive and, in essence, function as a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some very difficult problems to overcome," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Said the Kings' Marty McSorley: "We're prepared to shut it down." 
</P>
<P>
 No negotiations are scheduled today, although Bettman said he would not be 
averse to talking with Goodenow by phone and meeting with him again Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish I could report a great deal of progress, but there has not been," 
Bettman said. "We still have a lot of work to do and we continue to be 
available to meet, but I'm worried that time is getting short." 
</P>
<P>
 Bettman repeatedly expressed frustration over the failure to find common 
ground. Although both sides recognize the need to help subsidize small-market 
teams, owners want the subsidy to be tied to players' salaries and players want 
it to be borne primarily by the owners, in the form of a 5% levy on clubs' gate 
receipts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some wide rivers to cross," Bettman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing to me that one person (Bettman) has taken the bull by the 
horns and decided we're not going to play the game," Wayne Gretzky said in San 
Antonio after the Kings' exhibition game against the Dallas Stars. "I've been 
playing all these years, and to have a guy who's only been around one year do 
this, it's very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 Goodenow, in a letter sent to players last Saturday, agreed that the scope of 
their differences makes an agreement impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are committed to ongoing negotiations with the NHL through Oct. 1," 
Goodenow wrote. "Unfortunately, prospects for successfully concluding 
negotiations by that date are possible but not promising." 
</P>
<P>
 League sources say the NHL has prepared several schedules to cover 
cancellations of varying lengths. In addition, a club executive said he and his 
colleagues were instructed "a long time ago" to determine whether dates in 
their arenas will be available in June, July and August, anticipating that 
games would be postponed and added onto the end of the original schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings have made preliminary inquiries to determine dates the Forum will be 
available if they must make up games, a club spokesman said. He anticipated no 
scheduling conflicts next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mighty Ducks are holding dates on reserve at The Pond from May through 
August, as they did last summer for clinics, promotions and charity events, a 
spokesman said. Those dates could be used to play makeup games.

THIS USC PROJECT CANNOT BE RUSHED; TROJANS SLOWLY MOLD SHAWN WALTERS INTO THEIR 
FULLBACK FOR THE FUTURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The John Robinson-Charles White make-over of Shawn Walters seemed complete 
this week, 13 months after the project began. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters carried 31 times -- more than in any game in his life -- and gained 
207 yards Saturday in USC's 37-27 victory over Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "My back was really sore -- I got hit in the back a couple of times," he said 
Sunday morning, "but my legs felt fine. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't feel banged up or anything. It was fun. I never got tired. It was a 
challenge, and I had to step up to it or fall by the wayside. I owed it to my 
teammates." 
</P>
<P>
 When Robinson reported to the first training camp of his second term as USC's 
coach in August of 1993, he inspected the tailback candidates and immediately 
saw that no one had taught Walters, then a 225-pound freshman, that the 
shortest distance between two points is a straight line. 
</P>
<P>
 In a run drill -- tailbacks running against two linebackers -- Walters tried 
to run around them, toward the sideline.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, listen!" Robinson shouted. "If you want to run like that, then you diet 
down to about 175 pounds and get real fast. But if you want to play tailback 
here, you run over these guys, not around them!" 
</P>
<P>
 It took maybe half a season for Walters to fully grasp the concept, but he 
eventually did, and he has been Robinson's starting tailback ever since.  
</P>
<P>
 Against Baylor on Saturday, he looked exactly like the power back that 
Robinson and White, his position coach, had hoped to develop.  
</P>
<P>
 Baylor's strong safety, 210-pound Adrian Robinson, can attest to that.  
</P>
<P>
 On Walters' second of three touchdown runs, a 39-yard burst through left 
tackle, Robinson -- described in the Baylor press book as "an incredible 
athlete" -- drew a bead on Walters. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters saw him coming and, instead of trying to elude Robinson, lowered his 
right shoulder. Robinson did the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters kept his feet under him, did a 360-degree spin and kept on running. 
When he reached the end zone, Robinson was still down, and needed assistance to 
leave the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson took on Walters again later in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 In the third quarter, from the Trojan nine, Walters ran 16 yards up the 
middle. Robinson presented himself again, this time wrapping Walters in a 
charging, waist-high tackle. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters not only broke the tackle without breaking stride, he knocked Robinson 
into the air. 
</P>
<P>
 The transformation of Walters is Robinson's most visible coaching success 
since his return. 
</P>
<P>
 When the '93 season began, Walters was one of six tailbacks and was third on 
the depth chart. Dwight McFadden started the season, promptly suffered a broken 
ankle, and was sidelined for the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Fields took over, had some early season fumble problems and today is 
playing strong safety. David Dotson and LaVale Woods were in the mix too.  
</P>
<P>
 Only the new, remodeled Walters remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson compares him to pros Barry Foster and Jerome Bettis at a similar 
point in their development. Some, after Saturday, liken him to Earl Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 Where does Walters go from here? 
</P>
<P>
 To fullback, maybe.  
</P>
<P>
 No one in Robinson's offense has a firm grip on the fullback slot yet, and 
with talented freshmen Delon Washington and Rodney Sermons and currently 
injured junior Leonard Green eagerly awaiting chances to play at tailback, 
Robinson concedes that Walters eventually will play fullback, although probably 
not this year.  
</P>
<P>
 Washington is at least temporarily sidelined while USC investigates his 
eligibility. USC pulled him from the Baylor game last Friday, citing "questions 
regarding his eligibility." Tuesday, Robinson called it "an admissions matter." 
</P>
<P>
 But for now, Robinson and Walters will enjoy Walters' 207-yard game. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Only one Trojan, Walters, had a 100-yard running game last season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- USC's running game averaged 114.6 rushing yards in 1992 and 108.6 last 
season. The Trojans this season are averaging 148 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Walters had surpassed his previous one-game rushing high by halftime 
Saturday, when he had 127 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He learned the game in Lawton, Okla., before moving to the Dallas-Ft. Worth 
area for his junior year, at Lamar High, in Arlington.  
</P>
<P>
 "Shawn was a physical runner when he needed to be for us," recalled his Lamar 
coach, Eddie Peach. 
</P>
<P>
 "But he was faster than most high school kids, and he'd outrun them when he 
could. I told him he'd have to be a more physical runner in college, because 
he'd find he wasn't as fast as he thought he was. 
</P>
<P>
 "He came to us as a linebacker and we had a very good senior tailback when he 
got here. But when our tailback dislocated his elbow, Shawn got his chance." 
</P>
<P>
 He averaged 6.7 yards per carry for a 12-1 team in 1991, and set school 
records with 4,285 yards and 59 touchdowns. He gained 293 yards in one game and 
had a stretch of five 200-yard games. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent 1992 as a freshman redshirt at USC, then joined the tailback 
sweepstakes last season, starting the last seven games and finishing with a 
4.6-yard average. He gained 711 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 He says he's stronger and more fit than he was a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten rid of a lot of the baby fat I had last year, but I have a long 
way to go," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "My wind is much better than it was. Last year, two straight run plays and I'd 
get winded. Now, I just don't get tired." 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson wants Walters to add 15 pounds of muscle and play at about 240 
pounds.  
</P>
<P>
 "A year ago, Shawn looked like a kid," Robinson said. "He still had an 
adolescent's body. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, he's starting to mature. If he becomes an avid weight trainer, he can 
get to 240 and become a really good power back."  
</P>
<P>
 And what of playing fullback?  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't matter," Walters said. "Wherever Coach Robinson wants me to play, 
that's where I'll play."

 A receptionist turns to a man on a couch. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Montana?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The doctor will see you now." 
</P>
<P>
 The man enters the doctor's office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Montana?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Doctor Hackenbush."

<P>
 "Nice to meet you."

<P>
 "Please, sit down." 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 "Something wrong, Mr. Montana?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Uh, may I lie down?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly, Mr. Montana." 
</P>
<P>
 The man reclines on the doctor's sofa. 
</P>
<P>
 "Feel better?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, doctor." 
</P>
<P>
 "Fine. Well, now, Mr. Montana. May I begin by saying that you are my favorite 
football player in the whole wide world of sports." 
</P>
<P>
 "Thanks, doc." 
</P>
<P>
 "What seems to be the problem?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Doc, it's hard to explain." 
</P>
<P>
 "Try." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm uncomfortable. I've never seen a psychiatrist before." 
</P>
<P>
 "Just relax." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK." 
</P>
<P>
 "Take a few deep breaths. Clear your mind." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK." 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, tell me. What's eating you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 "How's that?" 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 "Rams are eating you?" 
</P>
<P>
 "No." 
</P>
<P>
 "My, that is a bad dream." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, doc. The football Rams. The ones from Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh. What about them?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost to them." 
</P>
<P>
 "I see." 
</P>
<P>
 "No, doc. You don't understand. I mean I lost to them." 
</P>
<P>
 "To the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes." 
</P>
<P>
 "And how does that make you feel?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Incompetent! Incoherent!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Mmm-hmmm.

<P>
 "Incredulous! In . . . in . . . sane!"

 "Let it all out."

 "Ashamed! Afraid!"

<P>
 "Afraid?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes! Who will I lose to next? " 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't follow you." 
</P>
<P>
 "Doc, I lost to the Rams!" 
</P>
<P>
 "And how does that make you feel?"

<P>
 "I just told you!"

 "OK, Mr. Montana, OK. Calm down." 
</P>
<P>
 "But Doc, the Rams!"

<P>
 "Easy, son." 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean, who next -- Tampa?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Try to relax." 
</P>
<P>
 "Cincinnati? Buddy Ryan?  
</P>
<P>
 "Here, Mr. Montana, breathe into this paper bag." 
</P>
<P>
 "Sorry, doc." 
</P>
<P>
 "You're hyperventilating. Relax." 
</P>
<P>
 "There. I feel better now." 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe, let's try something. I'll say a word. Then you say the first thing that 
pops into your head." 
</P>
<P>
 "OK." 
</P>
<P>
 "Apple." 
</P>
<P>
 "Banana."

<P>
 "Black."

 "Joe, get a hold of yourself." 
</P>
<P>
 "And I got shut out!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Joe, don't stand on my couch." 
</P>
<P>
 "Shut out! By the Rams!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Please. Scuff marks."

<P>
 "Me! Super Joe!"

<P>
 "I thought that was Namath."

<P>
 "Doc, you gotta help me! Tell me it was all a bad dream! Make it go away!" 
</P>
<P>
 "Come see me twice a week." 
</P>
<P>
 "Please, Doc. Gigantic 300-pound rams keep chasing me in my sleep, trying to 
stick me with their horns." 
</P>
<P>
 "Make it five times a week." 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't show my face in San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean Kansas City." 
</P>
<P>
 "I mean San Francisco." 
</P>
<P>
 "Here, let me prescribe these." 
</P>
<P>
 "What are they?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle placebo. Take two and go beat the Raiders." 
</P>
<P>
 "Gee, thanks, doc." 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll make you an appointment for next Monday, just in case." 
</P>
<P>
 "So long, doc."

 The man leaves. The doctor buzzes his receptionist.

DODGER CUTS TO INCLUDE 25 POSITIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON and ROSS NEWHAN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On the day before his team is expected to eliminate 25% of its front-office 
positions, Dodger owner Peter O'Malley went to Milwaukee on Tuesday to discuss 
the state of the game with baseball's acting commissioner, Bud Selig. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley could not be reached for comment, and Selig said only that the 
meeting was "extremely cordial" and included a thorough discussion of where the 
industry is as it copes with a players' strike that began on Aug. 12 and has 
caused cancellation of the playoffs and World Series. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley's seemingly tenuous relationship with Selig and outsiders' role in 
the labor dispute has been chronicled. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodger owner recently apologized to former commissioner Fay Vincent for 
joining Selig and Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf in the movement that 
led to Vincent's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Malley has also questioned Selig's dual role as club owner and acting 
commissioner and said that at some point someone has to assume responsibility 
and accountability for the failure to reach a bargaining agreement. "The focus 
keeps coming back to Buddy," O'Malley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, reacting to the financial impact of the strike, the Dodgers are 
expected to eliminate 20 full-time and five part-time positions today, it was 
learned. 
</P>
<P>
 The team had previously cut the salaries of management personnel by 15% and 
non-management personnel by 10%, reducing their work week to four days in the 
process.

DESPITE PROFITS, DUCK OFFICIAL WANTS CAP; HOCKEY: TAVARES SAYS LONG-TERM 
FINANCIAL SUCCESS WOULD BE ENDANGERED BY SALARY SPIRAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The Angels cry poor, the Rams cry poor stadium. On the other side of the 57 
Freeway, the Mighty Ducks made a bundle in their first NHL season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, are we a small-market team?" General Manager Jack Ferreira says, his 
eyebrows arching with his joke. "The Angels say they are. I was just 
wondering." 
</P>
<P>
 The Walt Disney Co.-owned NHL team made a seven-figure profit in its first 
season by selling out 98.9% of The Pond's capacity, grabbing the largest share 
of the NHL's $1-billion merchandise sales and scrimping by with the league's 
lowest payroll, at $7.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
 So why is this team's management supporting the NHL's plan to impose a lockout 
unless a new agreement is reached with players before Saturday's scheduled 
season openers? 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks already have sold 12,500 season tickets, drawn a remarkable average 
of 16,576 for four exhibitions at The Pond, and have one of the league's most 
promising rookies in Paul Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks have a state-of-the-art arena, a sweetheart of a lease and fans so 
loyal that they bought 22,000 single-game tickets the day after it was 
announced the season might be postponed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This franchise in particular would pay a very dear price for this one," 
acknowledged club president Tony Tavares, who declined to reveal actual profit 
figures. "This is one of the years you expect to get back part of your 
investment. In the first two years, you expect to make more than a mature team, 
because your payroll is still below league average." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tavares isn't bucking the NHL's hard-line approach. On the contrary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it basically comes down to a decision between short-term benefits and 
long-term benefits," he said. "For every dollar in new revenue we're 
generating, we're spending much more than that in player salary increases. 
Hence, you don't have to spend a lot of time analyzing it. You have an eroding 
bottom line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless we get that under control somehow, it leads you to the conclusion that 
financial disaster is right around the corner." 
</P>
<P>
 Negotiators are trying to find common ground on several key issues, including 
a plan to help small-market teams -- something players think should be the 
owners' responsibility, not theirs -- as well as changes in salary arbitration 
and free agency. In the most divisive issue, owners are seeking to link player 
salaries to revenues, and players are resisting any plan they believe is a 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks' payroll has increased dramatically since last season -- by as much 
as 60%, according to figures from the players' association. Still, at about 
$12.6 million -- a figure that is expected to increase somewhat -- it still 
ranks 21st among 26 teams. 
</P>
<P>
 The payroll last season was artificially low because it was made up largely of 
unproven fringe players who were exposed to the expansion draft by other NHL 
teams. It increased this season with the signing of two first-round draft picks 
-- Kariya, who is to make $2.8 million this season including signing bonuses, 
and Oleg Tverdovsky, who is to make $1.4 million including bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Tavares believes a rookie salary cap is a possibility -- but that wasn't 
enough to make him postpone signing Kariya. 
</P>
<P>
 "No. 1, we would have had to wait around and see what was going to happen, and 
that would have meant Paul would not be with us," Tavares said. "That was the 
key issue. We felt we had to improve and he could improve our club 
dramatically. . . . Nobody should read into it that I don't believe a salary 
cap can get done." 
</P>
<P>
 Duck players -- many of whom got their first real chance to play in the NHL in 
Anaheim -- reserve their resentment for Commissioner Gary Bettman, not their 
own team management, held in high esteem by most of them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's compare the difference between a lockout and a postponement of the 
season," forward Stu Grimson said. "The only real difference between a 
postponement and a work stoppage is we're actually on the ice working out from 
day to day (during a postponement). . . . I guarantee we won't be paid during 
the time that we're moving forward from Oct. 1. So how does that differ from a 
lockout?" 
</P>
<P>
 One thing didn't surprise many of them in the end -- there was no lockout 
during the exhibition season, during which players are not paid. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're getting 16,000 in the Anaheim Pond for an exhibition game," 
defenseman Don McSween said. "They're making money off exhibitions. We're not 
making a cent. They wouldn't lock us out (yet.)"

TAYLOR HAS BEEN TO ARKANSAS AND BACK; RUNNING: A TRIP HOME MADE HER REALIZE SHE 
NEEDED TO STICK AROUND. 
</P>

<P>
 There's nothing like Christmas in Southern California. And New Year's is 
pretty nice, too. Come to think of it Jan. 28, June 28, Aug. 28 and Sept. 28 
aren't half-bad, either. 
</P>
<P>
 Shelley Taylor knew all that when she left Edison High for the University of 
Arkansas, but it took a trip home over Christmas break 1993-94 to reinforce her 
opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arkansas campus, the people in Fayetteville and her teammates in 
cross-country and track were friendly enough. 
</P>
<P>
 It even seemed like home. 
</P>
<P>
 But something wasn't quite right and it took that trip to her real home to 
realize what she was missing. Her parents noticed something amiss, and soon 
enough Taylor told them: 
</P>
<P>
 "Mom, Dad, I can't go back." 
</P>
<P>
 So she didn't, deciding in a flash to transfer to UCLA. She couldn't be 
happier now. Running is fun again. 
</P>
<P>
 There was pressure at Arkansas. There was extraordinary competition. Every 
time Taylor turned around, she seemed to be running with another former high 
school state champion or NCAA All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor, who won State CIF cross-country and track titles as a senior at 
Edison, ran well as a freshman at Arkansas, placing 13th in the NCAA 
championship cross-country meet and seventh in the NCAA 5,000 track final. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore, she improved to ninth at the NCAA cross-country meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back, she's surprised she and others at Arkansas managed to run as 
well as they did. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't happy with the program," Taylor said. "It wasn't what I wanted out 
of college. I wanted more than to just run well. Running is not everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like cross-country because it's so individual, but the team is so important 
too. At Arkansas we had a great team. It just wasn't as close as it should have 
been. Maybe because there was so much pressure it made it difficult on 
everybody." 
</P>
<P>
 At UCLA, it's easy to slip into the background because the Los Angeles sports 
market is so huge. If the Bruins don't win the women's Pacific 10 cross-country 
title -- and they're not expected to -- nobody bats an eyelash. 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Peterson, in his first season as UCLA coach, has a talented team, but 
hardly anyone around the Westwood campus would call the Bruins a NCAA 
championship-caliber team. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's OK with Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 After informing her parents that she didn't want to return to Arkansas, which 
won a recruiting battle for Taylor in 1992, they told her to take her time 
picking her next move. Really, only UCLA entered her mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten weeks passed before Taylor entered UCLA for the spring quarter. She wasn't 
going to run competitively on the Bruin track team, so that gave her added time 
to adjust to her new surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that point I needed it," she said. "I had been through the wringer." 
</P>
<P>
 She tried her hand at coaching, helping out the distance runners at Edison for 
a while. She ran, but there wasn't the urgency she had left behind at Arkansas. 
If she missed a day or two or slowed to a crawl on her favorite route, there 
was no reason to fret. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, this was the first time she could dive headlong into her major -- 
English. 
</P>
<P>
 When she resumed difficult workouts last month, Taylor found herself 
surrounded by familiar, friendly faces. It looked like the starting line of so 
many races Taylor had run in high school. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Karen Hecox from West Covina South Hills, Anna Delgado from 
Calexico, Erica Sumi from Long Beach Wilson and Susannah Thrasher from Villa 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, this was more like it. This was starting to feel comfortable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just wasn't the right atmosphere at Arkansas," Taylor said. "I liked the 
people on the team. It was just too intense. It wasn't worth all the sacrifice. 
I'm glad I realized that when I did." 
</P>
<P>
 Hecox, a senior, and Taylor, a junior, form one of the best one-two 
combinations on the West Coast. So far, Hecox is the clear-cut No. 1 runner on 
the team, according to Taylor. That's OK, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor says she's content. After all, Hecox is a pretty fair runner, the first 
woman from UCLA to win Pac-10 and NCAA District 8 titles in the same year. She 
finished 10th at the '93 NCAA meet, just a step behind Taylor. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether they can lift UCLA to a better finish than last season's third-place 
showing at the Pac-10 meet remains to be seen. The first serious meet of the 
season is the Stanford Invitational Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Taylor has run well. She won a season-opening meet against Cal Poly 
Pomona and a UCLA alumni team and placed second at last week's Aztec 
Invitational at San Diego's Balboa Park. The Bruins won both meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Slowly but surely, UCLA is beginning to feel more like home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I miss a few things from Arkansas," she said. "I miss the change of the 
seasons. (But) it's so fortunate how it worked out. You pick a school coming 
out of high school and you feel a lot of loyalty. I still feel loyal (to 
Arkansas). It's been a tough adjustment period, but everyone here has been so 
great. 
</P>
<P>
 "UCLA is close to home, but not too close. It's just really perfect."

THE OLD MEN AND THE SEA; LOREN GREY, 78, FELL HOOK, LINE AND SINKER FOR THE 
FISH TALES TOLD BY HIS FATHER, ZANE GREY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETE THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He claims to have once seen a mutant shark that was 50 feet long, "with a head 
the size of a living room." 
</P>
<P>
 He swears he once saw a blue marlin with a bill on its lower jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 He also says he once caught a striped marlin off Catalina that was bigger and 
heavier than the state-record 339-pounder, landed in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Such claims might be taken with a grain of salt. 
</P>
<P>
 But they aren't. 
</P>
<P>
 Loren Grey, after all, has seen and accomplished a lot on the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
 And he learned from a master. 
</P>
<P>
 His father was the author and noted outdoorsman, Zane Grey, who was known to 
exaggerate from time to time, but who probably saw and caught more marlin and 
swordfish than most hard-core anglers will ever dream of seeing or catching.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Zane Grey's fishing exploits were legendary. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1937, he held 10 all-tackle world records, one of them being the first 
1,000-pound marlin caught on rod and reel. He was said to have hooked more than 
100 swordfish in one year, many of those around the Channel Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1925, he battled a monster of a swordfish well into the night in the waters 
off Santa Catalina Island. The giant broadbill, 11 1/2 hours into the fight, 
surfaced under the light of the moon and stars and started to feed on a school 
of flying fish, seemingly unaware that it had even been hooked. The fish broke 
the line and won its freedom half an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 And although Loren Grey never matched his father's exploits on the water, he 
accompanied Zane on many a trip and was no slouch with a rod and reel.  
</P>
<P>
 He is 78 now, and the countless hours he spent under the sun during his youth 
show on his weathered face. And judging from the enthusiasm he shows when 
spinning yarns about the good old days, about traveling the world with his 
father and uncle, R.C., or later about his days as a boat captain, taking the 
rich and famous out to try their luck on billfish, one gets the idea that Loren 
Grey benefited in more ways than one from being the son of Zane. 
</P>
<P>
 Loren caught his first fish when he was 5, while Zane was offshore searching 
for giant billfish. Zane left Loren at Avalon in the care of a nanny. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had to slip away," Loren recalls. "I went to the end of the pier and caught 
a rock bass." 
</P>
<P>
 He caught his first yellowtail when he was 9 and, when he was 14, his father 
thought it time he became a man, which in this instance meant it was time to 
tackle a marlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father sent me out for two weeks and I kept missing them," Loren 
remembers. "We averaged about one strike a day but I couldn't catch one. So 
finally he got mad and hooked the fish for me himself." 
</P>
<P>
 Loren fell in love with the sport. He reeled in everything he could get his 
hooks into, going deep for giant sea bass and fly-lining for marlin and 
swordfish.  
</P>
<P>
 He and his father once caught and released 12 marlin in one day near San 
Clemente Island. The two spent lots of time around the islands, particularly 
Catalina, where the outspoken Zane was once vice president of the prestigious 
Avalon Tuna Club.  
</P>
<P>
 Zane Grey was and still is revered for the prestige he brought the club, but 
he brought controversy as well, most notably what Loren calls the Spaulding 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Seems in 1926, Mrs. Keith Spaulding -- the petite wife of the president of the 
club -- caught a broadbill weighing 426 pounds. Zane had battled a 418-pound 
broadbill three weeks earlier and said there was no way a woman as small as 
Spaulding could have reeled in a fish so big and strong. Club records were a 
measure of one's talents and Zane's pride was at stake. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, everybody thought it was a phony," Loren says, "except most of them 
talked about it quietly between beers at the bar. But Zane didn't. He said 
right out, 'Yeah, I think it is a fake.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Tuna Club convened a meeting of the board of directors and decided that 
Zane should apologize. He did, but at the same time he tendered his 
resignation. His brother R.C. also resigned. Their photographs were taken from 
the walls and their club records stripped. 
</P>
<P>
 Zane had also been at odds with the club and its insistence on allowing 
nothing heavier than 24-strand linen line -- equivalent to about 70-pound test 
monofilament. After he quit, he spooled his huge reel with 39-strand line -- 
equivalent to about 120-pound test -- and went out and landed a 582-pound 
swordfish. R.C. boated a 588-pounder that Loren says "is still the biggest game 
fish ever caught at Catalina." 
</P>
<P>
 Zane has since been posthumously reinstated. And, ironically, two of the 
photographs put back on the walls of the Tuna Club were of the two swordfish 
taken on the "illegal" line.  
</P>
<P>
 Loren, who lobbied to have them reinstated and who is now an honorary member 
of the club, calls it poetic justice, while at the same time adding that his 
father probably got what was coming to him. 
</P>
<P>
 Before Zane died, he and the fishermen in the family took several trips to the 
South Pacific in search of the giant billfish for which the region was 
notorious. On one such trip they had heard from the natives of a giant shark 
that ruled the water around Rangiroa near Tahiti.  
</P>
<P>
 Zane went out fishing one day and returned saying that he had seen the shark, 
which he said was at least "six fathoms long," or 36 feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought, 'No, that's just foolishness,' " Loren recalls. "Well, two days 
later, while on the boat we saw birds flying erratically over a yellow-colored 
patch of water." 
</P>
<P>
 That patch, Loren said, was the giant shark swimming just beneath the surface. 
 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would have been a whale, but its tail stuck 10 feet out of the 
water," Loren remembers. "It was not a whale shark or a basking shark, it was 
brown like all the smaller ones in the area, which rarely get up to 10-12 feet 
long. I looked right down at him, and the head was as wide as this room. It had 
to be 50 feet long. 
</P>
<P>
 "And not only did I see it, everyone on the boat saw it. And then Pa, who had 
been up on the deck, comes running down and said, 'See, son, I told you; I'll 
make you eat crow!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Zane Grey later wrote about the shark in his book, "Tales of Tahitian Waters." 
</P>
<P>
 It was near Bermagui, Australia, that the blue marlin surfaced, showing off a 
bill on the wrong end of its jaw. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we went fishing we always had two boats out and one time, I swear, we 
saw a blue marlin with its bill on the lower jaw," Loren says. "It came along 
and it followed the bait for quite a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "About three or four days later I was fishing with dad and I hooked this 
marlin, and he went all over the place. It looked to me to be a regular blue, 
but Pa swears it was the fish with the bill on its lower jaw." 
</P>
<P>
 No one will ever know. Bad bill or not, the fish got away. 
</P>
<P>
 Zane suffered a stroke and died not long thereafter, on Oct. 23, 1939, at his 
home in Altadena. Loren, meanwhile, had established himself as an able boatman 
and fisherman. He operated a charter boat while attending college from 1938-40, 
taking out those who could afford the high price of $25. 
</P>
<P>
 "That type of fishing was a rich man's field," Loren says. 
</P>
<P>
 His clients included actors Robert Montgomery, Errol Flynn, Nigel Bruce and 
Ronald Coleman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coleman was the only one I ever got a marlin for, though," says Grey, adding 
that Montgomery and Bruce were on the boat that day. "Unfortunately, there was 
no canopy on the boat and everybody got (sunburned) and didn't show the next 
day. I always thought that if I met Montgomery again -- of course he's passed 
away now -- I'd hit him up for the money he forgot to pay. He stiffed me out of 
$15." 
</P>
<P>
 Loren Grey caught his huge striped marlin off Catalina on Sept. 4, 1940. It 
tipped the Avalon scale at 344 pounds. In 1932, a Tuna Club member had caught a 
striper weighing 405 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 When Grey, who went on to become a professor of educational psychology at Cal 
State Northridge, read in The Times recently about the state record being a 
339-pounder, he wrote a letter asking for an explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 A quick investigation revealed that the California Department of Fish and Game 
didn't start keeping records until the late 1940s.  
</P>
<P>
 Making the striped marlin record a Grey area indeed.

RUNNING FROM TROUBLE; NORDHOFF STANDOUT JOSH HAWKINS ESCAPES GANG TACKLE WITH 
MOVE TO OJAI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has Fred Astaire's feet, Michael Jackson's hips, the improvisational skills 
of Robin Williams and can escape whether hemmed in, wrapped up or hog tied, 
just like Harry Houdini. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so maybe that's overstating the case -- a little. Suffice it to say that 
Josh Hawkins is to high school football what the compact disk is to music. All 
you would want in a nice, neat, durable package. He is a human entertainment 
unit. His stage, any grass field. His performance, spectacular. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawkins show plays Friday nights during the fall at sites determined by 
the Nordhoff High football schedule. There is no warm-up act. 
</P>
<P>
 On the very first play of this season, Hawkins ran 82 yards with a kickoff 
return, slaloming past groping defenders with the resolve of a street urchin 
with a loaf of bread under his arm. The same game, he scooped up a fumble and 
raced 50 yards for a touchdown on the final play of the half, as if to provide 
his audience something else to buzz about during intermission. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins, a 6-foot, 178-pound senior, is a running back in the same way that, 
by definition, Elton John is a piano player. Such a singular description 
doesn't do him justice. 
</P>
<P>
 "Josh rarely gets a rest," Nordhoff Coach Cliff Farrar said. "The time he's 
off the field is when we're kicking off, and if we're playing a real important 
(game), he'd probably be out there for that, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Look for him out there on Friday night, when Nordhoff meets Oak Park in a 
nonleague matchup of undefeated teams. As tailback, Hawkins has rushed for 361 
yards and four touchdowns in Nordhoff's three games. As a cornerback, he has 
two interceptions -- which constitutes a high percentage of the passes 
opponents dared cast in his direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrar, who has been coaching football for 23 years, says he has never tutored 
a runner who could retain his balance after a hit and accelerate back to top 
speed faster than Hawkins. 
</P>
<P>
 And moves? 
</P>
<P>
 There was a run that set up a touchdown two weeks ago against Santa Ynez. 
There was that five-yard gain against Moorpark last season that Farrar said 
"was as good as any run I've ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 Talk to those who have watched Hawkins most and there is no consensus about 
which was his best run, his best move. 
</P>
<P>
 But ask Hawkins and there is no debate. No. 1 on the charts is the move that 
brought him to Ojai from Kirkland, Wash. How's this for a cutback against the 
grain: Hawkins, who lived in the Seattle suburb until he was 13, fled the 
street gangs of Washington to find peace, serenity and direction in Southern 
California. "The way it was, I'd have been dead or in jail by now," Hawkins 
said. Stealing. Drugs. You name it, he probably tried it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were Crips and there were Bloods," Hawkins said. "I was 11 when I 
started hanging with the Crips -- wannabes, actually. I didn't go to school 
half the time. We'd go to Seattle on school days and break into cars and stuff, 
just looking for trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 After his parents split when he was 2, Hawkins lived with his mother in 
Kirkland, visiting his father in Ojai only during summer. 
</P>
<P>
 One summer, he asked to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 That decision as a 13-year-old marked only a stutter-step. Hawkins didn't 
reverse his field entirely by changing his ways until his sophomore season at 
Nordhoff. 
</P>
<P>
 He was a naturally gifted athlete, but no better than a C student until his 
father, Chuck, and his second wife, Denise, developed a sure-fire plan for 
developing better study habits. 
</P>
<P>
 They threatened him. 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins' 16th birthday was fast approaching. No grades, no license. Improved 
grades? Hmmm, maybe a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, his grade-point was soaring at the pace of the national debt. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted it," he said of his driving privileges. "My dad and mom told me what 
I had to do and I was like, 'Well, whatever it takes. I'm driving.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins now tools around town in a very cool 1980 Mustang. And the funny thing 
is, his grades still are improving, from 3.14 as a sophomore to 3.31 the final 
semester of last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Getting good grades is something he feels good about," Denise Hawkins said. 
"Now that he's motivated, he likes to work hard in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 College has replaced a car on Hawkins' wish list, prompting even greater 
devotion to his studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that he has a choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Denise, a food service supervisor at Nordhoff, has a support group of 
teachers, counselors and staff keeping a watchful eye on her stepson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I couldn't get away from those people if I wanted to," Hawkins said. 
</P>
<P>
 He doesn't want to. Hawkins thoroughly enjoys his stature as a main man on the 
Nordhoff campus. He is involved in student government. He is co-captain of the 
football team. And, somehow, his popularity survives with barely a hint of 
jealousy from his teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "Josh is a good player who works hard," said Dallan Rigby, Hawkins' running 
mate in the Nordhoff backfield. "He deserves the attention he gets. What 
matters most to him is that we win the ballgame." 
</P>
<P>
 Hawkins takes obvious pride in being a conscientious leader.  
</P>
<P>
 After a 18-7 victory over St. Bonaventure last week, he went out of his way to 
congratulate every teammate he could find -- including one with dyed orange 
hair and several others who emerged from a game played in rain and mud wearing 
clean uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a leader on the team," Farrar said. "A lot of times a kid with a lot of 
speed and talent doesn't take it upon himself to win every sprint at the end of 
practice. Josh does. 
</P>
<P>
 "You watch the way he treats his teammates. You watch and see when Dallan 
makes a run who's right there first, helping him up, patting him on the back 
and telling him, 'Nice run.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Offensive linemen receive even better treatment. Hawkins provides his blockers 
with the teen-age equivalency of a steak dinner, wine and a Rolex watch: an 
all-you-can-eat smorgasbord, Gatorade and M&Ms. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrar laughs when recalling that a week ago, before the St. Bonaventure game, 
Hawkins told friends that his stepmother had offered to sew elastic into the 
sleeves of Nordhoff's visiting uniforms. 
</P>
<P>
 When more than a dozen players lobbed their jerseys at him, Hawkins faced a 
predicament. Denise couldn't sew that many. "So you know what he did? He handed 
the others back, and kept the linemen's," Farrar said. "He takes care of his 
guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Truth be told, Hawkins feels much the same way about most of the people he 
knows at Nordhoff, and his list of college choices are the best evidence of 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 All of them are in California -- UCLA, USC, Cal and San Diego State. 
</P>
<P>
 "I used to want to go anywhere, the farther away the better," Hawkins said. 
"Now I'd like to stay close to home. 
</P>
<P>
 "This family has done so much for me, I want to be here. I feel like I'm 
somebody now."

TRAINER OF HORSES WITH MYSTERY VIRUS DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Vic Rail, a leading horse trainer, died Tuesday, a week after he was stricken 
by a virus with symptoms similar to one that has killed 14 racehorses. He was 
49. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail died of a heart attack in Mater Hospital, where he was in the intensive 
care unit, the hospital said. 
</P>
<P>
 All racing in the south of Queensland state has been halted while authorities 
try to find the cause of the illness that has struck two suburban stables the 
past week -- those of Rail and the adjoining stables of John Fitzgerald. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors have been unable to establish a link between Vail's illness and the 
mystery horse virus. 
</P>
<P>
 Rail was best known as the trainer of Vo Rogue, who won more than $2.3 million 
between 1987 and 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Poisoning has been ruled out as the cause of the horse deaths. 
</P>
<P>
 Ian Douglas, exotic diseases director for the Department of Primary 
Industries, said veterinary experts have agreed a virus was the cause of the 
deaths, but no known condition has been revealed by tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas said the disease did not appear to have spread beyond the two stables. 
</P>
<P>
 He has ruled out African horse sickness, equine flu, equine herpes and three 
types of encephalitis as possible causes.

JOCKEY WHO PULLED RIVAL FROM MOUNT IS SUSPENDED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A jockey who pulled a rival off his horse after losing a race was banned for 
six months on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kieran Fallon of Ireland was found guilty of violent and improper conduct on a 
racecourse.He received one of the stiffest sentences ever handed out by the 
disciplinary committee of the Jockey Club, the governing body for British horse 
racing. 
</P>
<P>
 Fallon pulled Stuart Webster off his mount, Sailormaite, after Sailormaite had 
won the John Mangles Memorial Handicap at Beverly on Sept. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, the two jockeys fought in the weighing room, with Webster suffering 
a broken nose. The committee cleared the two on charges of improper conduct in 
connection with the brawl because the stewards could not establish who was to 
blame.

COMMENTARY; JET FACES ARE NEW, BUT THE STORY IS OLD 
</P>

<P>
 The New York Jets' 25 years without a championship feel like twice that 
sometimes, and make their fans as crazy and angry as Ranger fans used to be. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets always lead the league in high hopes and expectations, and they seem 
to make more out of one victory than any other team I know. Now they are 
suddenly back in familiar territory, before they get out of the first month of 
the season. 
</P>
<P>
 They emptied Giants Stadium Sunday night as if there had been a bomb scare, 
and they are a .500 team. All of a sudden they need to look like a real team 
against the Browns on Sunday, and Pete Carroll needs to look like a real coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played like garbage," Carroll said. "Now we're starting over. Over a long 
season, there's always a series of new starts. We get one Sunday afternoon at 1 
o'clock." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets have played four games and we still don't know if Carroll can do the 
job in the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be terrific if Carroll could do the job, because he is bright and 
spirited and doesn't look as if he has been sedated with X's and O's, the way 
some coaches do. We simply don't know yet. He is still a popular former 
assistant getting on-the-job training. Nobody remembers anymore, but Joe Walton 
was that kind of popular former assistant when he took over for Walt Michaels. 
The players all raved about what a good guy Walton was. 
</P>
<P>
 Carroll knows this: It has been a long first month in a rookie season. Now the 
Jets have to start over against the Browns in Cleveland. Only a couple of weeks 
ago, Carroll was the daring and exuberant genius of everything, and nobody had 
laid a glove on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Then it was Bears 19, Jets 7 on Sunday night. All of a sudden we are supposed 
to believe that Dave Wannstedt of the Bears did to Carroll what Oliver McCall 
did to Lennox Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even when I was hearing how smart I was supposed to be, all I could keep 
thinking was what a long haul this all is," Carroll said. "And how fast things 
can change." 
</P>
<P>
 There was a pause and then Carroll said, "I'm just not going to be too quick 
to categorize this team. I know fans do that, and they have a right to do that. 
Coaches don't have that luxury. The same thing that happened to us Sunday night 
happened to the Chiefs Sunday afternoon. I mean, where are the Chiefs now? They 
got shut out by the Rams at home. We played the way we did against the Bears. 
All of a sudden the Dolphins were behind the Vikings, 28-0." 
</P>
<P>
 Another pause. "Am I concerned? Of course I'm concerned, because we've lost 
the way we have twice in a row. That's why I know the words sound hollow when I 
say this team is different from Jet teams of the past. We've got to show we're 
different on the field. Which means we've got to find ourselves in a hurry." 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets play in the most entertaining division in all of pro football, the 
AFC East. They beat the Bills in Buffalo the first Sunday of the season. Then 
the Bills picked themselves right up. The Dolphins started out 3-0, but they 
keep losing running backs, and even though they came back and made a game of it 
Sunday against the Vikings, their defense looks so shabby you want to lend them 
Charles Oakley and Anthony Mason. 
</P>
<P>
 The Patriots were 0-2 when the Jets were 2-0. The Patriots were lucky enough 
to play the Bengals next; the Bengals could not beat Columbia right now. 
Sunday, the Patriots needed to beat the Lions on the road and did. Suddenly the 
Patriots are 2-2, and are going to be trouble for everybody the rest of the 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly the Jets are the mystery team of the division. A loss to the Browns 
on the road does not end the season or kill all playoff hope or mean that 
Carroll is a bum. 
</P>
<P>
 Quarterback Boomer Esiason takes a seat now because of a sprained ankle so the 
Jets go in there with Jack Trudeau, a backup who hardly inspired anyone after 
the Bear game by explaining about how few snaps a backup quarterback gets in 
practice. It is still important for the Jets to show more precision than they 
showed against the Bears, and more heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets went down the field once against the Bears, and it was as if the 
Bears were supposed to go down like Lennox Lewis. When they did not, the Jets 
fell apart. Before the first half was over, fans watching on television in New 
York were already switching over to the marvelous footage of Jackie Robinson on 
Ken Burns' baseball documentary. 
</P>
<P>
 "It got away from us fast," Carroll said. "All of a sudden I looked up and 
we'd frittered away a whole half." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end it had been such a dreadful, amateurish performance one month into 
the season that you expected the fans who had stayed at Giants Stadium to begin 
a chant about "1969." Even though this is Carroll's rookie shot as a coach, 
this is supposed to be a big playoff shot for the Jets. With football geezers 
such as Ronnie Lott and Art Monk and even kicker Nick Lowery around, the Jets 
have been built for this season. 
</P>
<P>
 A .500 record is not acceptable any longer for Dick Steinberg, the general 
manager, and he should not survive another .500 record. The Jets are supposed 
to go for first place this season. The Jets are not supposed to merely make the 
playoffs, but do something when they get there. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the design," Carroll said. "That's why we got the guys we got." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg has gotten four seasons plus four games. Carroll, a good guy, has 
gotten only these four games. The last two have been wrecks. His quarterback is 
hurt. A player who is supposed to be an offensive star -- tight end Lam 
Mitchell -- still talks better than he plays. A kid who is supposed to be a 
defensive star -- Marvin Jones -- seems to get hurt as soon as he gets his chin 
strap fastened. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jets are supposed to fight for first place this season, but they looked 
like last place Sunday night. They looked like the Bengals. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're still new," the new coach said. 
</P>
<P>
 That gets old, fast.

 DISNEY DICTIONARY? If you're brazen enough to call yourself "The Happiest 
Place on Earth," you have to expect some people to have a little fun with your 
image. Disneyland has inspired a new term by the resurrected Spy magazine: 
"Disneyfication," defined as "the act of assuming traits more familiarly 
associated with a theme park than with real life." . . . . And the knife twist: 
"Genuine Disneyfication must be tawdry, contrived, and useless." 
</P>
<P>
 MICKEY'S PRISONER: Then there's Mouth 2 Mouth, a new teen magazine by Time 
Publishing, which has fun this month with a story by Rachel Camacho, a young 
woman detained when she tried to slip into Disneyland without a ticket. . . . 
Writes Camacho: "Disneyland Jail. The walls were covered with pictures of Walt, 
Mickey and Donald. Rows of happy pictures where those who have defied the 
Disney Honor are placed . . . They asked if I knew why I was there. I figured 
it had something to do with me trying to sneak into the park without paying." 
</P>
<P>
 FIRED UP: Women at the county's Fire Department have reason to celebrate. This 
is the 20th anniversary of the first woman ever hired by a fire department in 
America. Also, Jane Van Sickle, the first woman firefighter hired by the county 
18 years ago, recently became its second female captain. It now has 3% female 
firefighters, above the 2% national average. . . . Says Van Sickle: "It was 
tough at first -- a lot of male macho -- until I proved myself. Now the men are 
used to us." 
</P>
<P>
 LEAVING IT BETTER: Before there was a cancer center at Hoag Memorial Hospital 
Presbyterian in Newport Beach, before there was a Heart Institute there, before 
it had five outpatient centers, was before Michael Stephens took over as 
president and chief executive in 1984. Stephens on Tuesday announced he'll soon 
leave Hoag for a bigger health services position in Seattle (B1). . . . Says 
former Hoag chief of staff Dr. Donald Drake: "Few have his strategic vision and 
leadership. We'll miss him."

 SAT SCORES: Valley teens generally do better on the SATs than other students 
in the Los Angeles Unified School District, with Van Nuys High taking top 
honors locally with an average of 1,029 (above). . . . Today's Valley Briefing 
breaks down the scores for 1993 and 1994 (B5). 
</P>
<P>
 SAME NAME: He spells his first name differently, and has nothing to do with 
the O.J. Simpson case. But, like it or not, Marc Fuhrman, a part-time comic who 
often performs in the Thursday Night Live show at the L.A. Connection in 
Sherman Oaks, can't escape it. He's mistaken for the detective who found the 
bloody glove. . . . "It's weird hearing your name on the news and people 
talking against you," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 ARTS FUNDING: Valley cultural groups don't get the big bucks, but they don't 
get shut out, either. . . . The Los Angeles County Music and Performing Arts 
Commission recommended Monday that $15,000 of its grant fund go to the Glendale 
Symphony, $3,000 to the Valley Master Chorale, and $2,500 to the West Valley 
Symphony (F2). 
</P>
<P>
 POPULAR STOP: The Valley missed a big event last week when Bill Clinton 
canceled his trip on the eve of sending troops to Haiti. But this area has a 
long history of presidential visits. . . . According to Jerry Reynolds, author 
of "Santa Clarita, Valley of the Golden Dream," President Benjamin Harrison 
campaigned in Saugus in 1891, and Teddy Roosevelt spent a few days at the Acton 
Hotel in 1903. 
</P>
<P>
 NO LIMIT: Police Officer Christy Hamilton died in the line of duty answering a 
call in Northridge. And now her friends have done their duty. Their outrage 
helped prompt the City Council to vote Tuesday to eliminate a spending 
restriction on memorial plaques for slain officers (B7). . . . "It's more than 
just a matter of money," says Councilman Joel Wachs. "It is a matter of 
appreciation and respect." Top SAT Scores

S. CAROLINA GETS REPRIEVE ON NUCLEAR WASTE DUMP; ENERGY: ARRIVAL OF SHIPS 
CARRYING SPENT FUEL RODS FROM EUROPE IS DELAYED TO GIVE STATE MORE TIME TO 
BLOCK SHIPMENT IN COURT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The federal Energy Department on Tuesday delayed the arrival of ships carrying 
radioactive waste from Europe, giving South Carolina more time to try to block 
the shipment in court. 
</P>
<P>
 The two ships early Tuesday were several miles off the North Carolina coast. 
</P>
<P>
 They contain 153 spent fuel rods from research reactors in Austria, Denmark, 
the Netherlands and Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 The shipment is part of a U.S. effort to keep weapons-grade uranium out of the 
wrong hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The materiel was to come through Sunny Point Military Ocean Terminal in 
Brunswick County, N.C., then be shipped to the Savannah River Site weapons 
plant near Aiken, S.C., for storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, a three-judge panel of the U.S. 4th Circuit Court of Appeals threw 
out a lower court ruling blocking the shipment. 
</P>
<P>
 The state contends that the Energy Department used negotiations to delay a 
lawsuit, then allowed the ships to sail. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the department now improperly claims the matter is an emergency, 
the appeal says. 
</P>
<P>
 State Atty. Gen. Travis Medlock said papers have already been sent to the U.S. 
Supreme Court to take the case there in case the 4th Circuit rejects the 
appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will . . . use all means at our disposal to keep South Carolina from 
becoming the dumping ground for the world," Medlock said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Energy Department has encouraged reactor operators around the world to 
stop using highly enriched uranium fuel and move to a type of uranium that 
cannot be easily converted to weapons use. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal government promised to take back all the spent fuel it sold to 
operators of foreign reactors. 
</P>
<P>
 The department wants to import a total of 409 fuel elements in the next six 
months and 10,000 to 15,000 during the next 10 to 15 years.

DUCKS TAKE SHOTS AT VACCINE OPENER; HEALTH: 15 HOCKEY PLAYERS BRAVE 
IMMUNIZATIONS AFTER PRACTICE DURING THE START OF THE VISITING NURSE ASSN.'S 
DRIVE TO PREPARE RESIDENTS FOR FLU SEASON. 
</P>

<P>
 With three strains of influenza virus expected this winter, health officials 
Tuesday issued the season's first reminder that the elderly and people with 
chronic diseases should get flu vaccinations. 
</P>
<P>
 Helping the Visiting Nurse Assn. of Orange County begin its vaccination 
program -- one of two available to county residents this fall -- were 15 
barefoot and sweaty members of the Mighty Ducks hockey team, who rolled up 
their sleeves and submitted to vaccinations after a practice at The Pond in 
Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aw, it was painless," defenseman Don McSween said after receiving his shot. 
McSween said he decided to get vaccinated because he feared frequent travel 
between hot and cold climates would increase his risk of catching the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 The nonprofit public nurses association will charge $10 per vaccination; 
county health officials also expect to administer free vaccinations to about 
82,000 residents this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The free shots are reserved for those who could face serious, if not fatal, 
illnesses if they come down with the flu. This includes people older than 60, 
anyone with chronic diseases such as diabetes and emphysema, or those with 
long-term heart and lung problems. 
</P>
<P>
 For most people though, the flu merely causes several days of discomfort that 
include aches, pains, fever, chills, weakness, coughing, a runny nose and a 
sore throat. Some people remain under the weather for as little as 24 hours, 
while others are affected for as long as a week. 
</P>
<P>
 California's flu season typically begins in mid-December and peaks in January 
and February, said Dr. Loring Dales, chief of the immunization branch of the 
state Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials said they have no way of predicting what this year's flu 
season will be like, but early indications are encouraging. "Last year we had 
reports of the flu very early in the season, in August and September," said Dr. 
Gerald Wagner, medical director of the Orange County immunization project. But 
so far this year, there have been no reports of flu. 
</P>
<P>
 Health officials have identified three strains of influenza, each named after 
the place where they were discovered, that they believe will affect Americans 
this year: Texas, Shandong (China) and Panama. According to officials at the 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in Atlanta, Shandong is a new 
manifestation of the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 While some people face more risk from the flu than others, many health 
officials recommend that everyone get a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of us can be affected and we could all come down with the flu and miss 
work," said Joan Q. Randall, executive vice president of the Visiting Nurse 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 She said American businesses lose an estimated $4 billion annually because of 
employees calling in sick with flu-related illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 80% of those who receive vaccinations will never develop the flu or 
suffer only reduced effects, state health officials said. The only reported 
side effect of the vaccination is a slight soreness in the arm that lasts a day 
or two. 
</P>
<P>
 The nurses' association has begun providing immunization shots at area Long's 
Drugs, Sav-On Drug Stores and Albertson's supermarkets for anyone age 13 or 
older each weekend through Dec. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 The county also provides free vaccinations to people 60 years or older and 
those with chronic diseases. This year, the Orange County Health Care Agency 
has received enough vaccine from the state to administer 82,340 shots.  
</P>
<P>
 Public clinics will begin offering the vaccinations Nov. 1. About 75% of the 
doses are administered in the first month, Wagner said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vaccine helps recipients build immunity to the virus beginning about two 
weeks after the shot and protects them for several months. One shot each season 
is enough for those 9 years and older, but children 8 years or younger may 
require shots more frequently, health officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides getting a shot, health officials say the best way to avoid getting the 
flu is to wash hands often, get lots of sleep and avoid sick people. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who get the flu, health officials offer the following tips: Stay 
home and rest for the first three to five days, eat lightly and drink lots of 
fluids. Those who experience severe symptoms should see a doctor. Antiviral 
drugs such as amantadine or rimantadine may shorten the duration of the flu in 
adults if prescribed early. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents should give young children and infants acetaminophen medication, such 
as Tylenol, instead of aspirin to control fever. Help for Flu Season 
</P>
<P>
 Free flu shots will be provided for county residents who meet eligibility 
requirements. The immunizations will be given to: 
</P>
<P>
 * Anyone 60 and older. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nursing home and chronic-care facility residents, any age, with chronic 
medical conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 * People with chronic pulmonary or cardiovascular disorders, including asthma. 
</P>
<P>
 * Anyone requiring regular medical follow-up because of chronic metabolic 
diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 * Children and teen-agers, age 6 months to 18 years, receiving long-term 
aspirin therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Those with compromised immune systems, including anyone with HIV or AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 * Physicians, nurses and other hospital staff who have contact with those at 
risk for flu-related complications. 
</P>
<P>
 * Household members of those at risk of flu-related complications. 
</P>
<P>

SHELTER FOR ABUSE VICTIMS OKD OVER PROTESTS; NEIGHBORHOODS: ELI HOME CAN USE 
ANAHEIM HILLS SITE TO HOUSE UP TO 22 PEOPLE. AREA RESIDENTS HAD CITED CROWDING, 
TRAFFIC PROBLEMS AND POTENTIAL FOR VIOLENCE.

<P>
 Overriding objections from some neighbors, the City Council voted to allow an 
emergency shelter for abuse victims to open in an upscale Anaheim Hills 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "Clearly, this project is about solving problems in our society," said Mayor 
Tom Daly. "That's why I'm supporting this project." 
</P>
<P>
 The vote will allow the Eli Home to renovate a run-down structure at the 
southeast corner of Santa Ana Canyon Road and Canyon Crest Drive to accommodate 
up to 22 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Frank Feldhaus, who cast the only vote against the permit, said the 
shelter would be too cramped with that many people. Councilman Bob D. Simpson 
was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had postponed a decision on the home's proposal in August after 
neighbors complained about the original design and safety of the proposed 
shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 After Tuesday night's vote, Gene Secrest, who lives next door to the site and 
who hired an attorney to fight the proposal, said he probably will challenge 
the council's decision in court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't feel it's in the best interest of the children," Secrest said. The 
children's rooms "are smaller than the inside of your car, and that's not 
suitable." 
</P>
<P>
 The Eli Home, which has been honored by the last two U.S. Presidents, offers 
emergency shelter and counseling to victims of abuse. Annually, the 
organization helps more than 1,000 clients, mostly youths who have suffered 
emotional, physical or sexual abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors opposed to the project said the Eli Home would "devastate" their 
community by bringing in more traffic and potential for violence. Neighbors 
said they fear that an angry spouse may attack someone at the shelter or 
nearby. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eli Home unveiled new architectural plans for its .22-acre site to the 
council Tuesday. The new plans eliminate a proposed third floor, which 
originally had been proposed. The new proposal calls for eight bedrooms instead 
of nine, to accommodate up to seven adults, 14 children and a house manager.

 Along with 24 other conditions, Jack Rubens, the attorney representing Secrest 
and other neighbors, asked the council to limit the home's total occupants to 
10 temporary residents plus a live-in manager. Rubens also requested that the 
home's roof not be made of metal, which would be unlike the roofs of 
surrounding residences. 
</P>
<P>
 The council, however, rejected tacking on the proposed conditions to the 
home's permit. 
</P>
<P>
 Daly chastised attorneys representing both sides for failing to discuss the 
home's revised plans and for introducing dozens of new conditions for the 
council to consider hours before Tuesday's meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "You whip out conditions at the last minute, and our staff has to deal with 
them," said Daly. "It's very disappointing."

 Eli Home officials say the Anaheim Hills property, which they purchased for 
$125,000, is an ideal location.  
</P>
<P>
 With an annual budget of $25,000, the Eli Home depends almost entirely on 
donations and grants.

SUPERVISORIAL CANDIDATES TRADE INSULTS; DEBATE: JIM SILVA AND LINDA MOULTON 
PATTERSON TAKE SWIPES AT EACH OTHER'S RECORDS, POLITICAL TIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In a contentious debate that symbolized the race for the 2nd District 
supervisorial seat, candidates Linda Moulton Patterson and Jim Silva on Tuesday 
hurled insults and accused each other of lying about their political records. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate, in what is the hottest local race on the Nov. 8 ballot, opened 
with Moulton Patterson awarding Silva a plaque for being the "worst politician 
in Orange County." She told the audience of 150 at the Irvine Marriott that 
Silva is beholden to special interest groups and dodges tough decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva's response was quick: "I would like to remind Linda that she shouldn't 
put Tabasco sauce on her Wheaties in the morning. It doesn't do much for her 
personality." 
</P>
<P>
 From there, it only got uglier. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the June primary, Moulton Patterson, who is mayor of Huntington Beach, 
and Silva, who is a councilman from the same city, have been busy sniping at 
each other and raising money to win the coveted supervisorial seat being 
vacated by Supervisor Harriett M. Wieder. The contest promises to be a costly 
one. In the primary alone, each candidate spent more than $140,000. 
</P>
<P>
 At Tuesday's debate, the candidates touched on a number of issues confronting 
the county and the 2nd District, including the development of the Bolsa Chica 
wetlands, new jail construction and the future of the El Toro Marine Corps Air 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Although supervisorial seats are nonpartisan positions, the race is being 
fought along partisan lines. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, a Republican, has drawn support from local Republican leaders, 
including Reps. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), Christopher Cox (R-Newport 
Beach), Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) and supervisors Roger R. Stanton 
and Thomas F. Riley. Moulton Patterson, a Democrat, lists several unions and 
Democrat leaders as well as some notable Republicans, like Santa Ana Mayor 
Daniel H. Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva, who touts himself as a conservative, accused Moulton Patterson of being 
a "Clinton liberal" whose philosophy is contrary to most Orange County 
constituents and all other board members. Moulton Patterson, however, said her 
views are more diverse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I will represent all citizens, not just the members of one political party," 
she told the audience. " . . . I think it is a real plus to have a Democrat on 
the board. My God, what's wrong with one?" 
</P>
<P>
 She then accused Silva of being beholden to Stanton, who has endorsed Silva 
and helped him raise money.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think (Stanton) has played too much of a role," she said, adding that if 
she were elected she wouldn't "have to check with anyone" to vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Silva said he shares similar views with Stanton but that his vote will not be 
influenced by the supervisor. Stanton, who was at the debate, found it ironic 
that Moulton Patterson would criticize his endorsement of Silva, when she had 
solicited it for herself. 
</P>
<P>
 "Who are going to support?" Stanton asked. "Somebody who doesn't hold your 
views?" 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates also bickered over several issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Moulton Patterson said she favors building a new jail at the existing Santa 
Ana facility or the James A. Musick Branch Jail in Irvine. Silva proposes a new 
jail be built at the El Toro Marine Corps Air Station. She favors abortion 
rights, he is anti-abortion. 
</P>
<P>
 And they displayed similar, though not identical, views on other issues. 
</P>
<P>
 They both favor development of the Bolsa Chica wetlands, but Moulton Patterson 
prefers a less dense development. Both support an airport at El Toro, but 
Moulton Patterson is against a local ballot measure that will bypass the review 
process and leave the issue up to the voters. And both oppose rent control at 
apartments on mobile home parks. 
</P>
<P>
 The debate turned nastiest when the candidates were told to field questions 
from each other. Moulton Patterson accused Silva of accepting free cable 
television while being a member of a community cable board. Silva said the 
hookup was part of his salary. 
</P>
<P>
 When it was Silva's turn, he accused Moulton Patterson of flip-flopping on 
Proposition 187, which seeks to deny any public assistance to illegal 
immigrants. Like Silva, Moulton Patterson says she supports the legislation, 
although it "saddens" her to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the debate, tensions remained high. Silva's campaign distributed a 
copy of a fund-raising letter mailed by a number of Orange County officials and 
elected politicians on behalf of Moulton Patterson's campaign. Silva's campaign 
alleged it was mailed to transportation contractors doing business with the 
county and said it constituted a conflict of interest by letter writers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Sept. 20 letter, printed on the stationery of Young, a member of the 
Orange County Transportation Authority board, was co-signed by three other OCTA 
board members who vote on county transportation projects. The letter was an 
invitation to a $225 per person luncheon for Moulton Patterson scheduled for 
Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Young, the letter was signed by OCTA board members Sarah Catz; 
Irv Pickler, who is also the Democratic candidate in the 68th Assembly race and 
an Anaheim councilman; and Los Alamitos Councilman Robert P. Wahlstrom. 
</P>
<P>
 But Harvey Englander, Moulton Patterson's campaign consultant, said there is 
no conflict because Young and Pickler are not running for reelection to their 
council seats and later this year will leave the transportation board. He said 
being backed by Stanton raises a more serious issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person whose stationery (the letter) is on, will not be in office. . . . 
That's a heck of a lot different from someone who's a member of the five-member 
Board of Supervisors, who has been calling people and arm-twisting for funds 
for his compatriot," Englander said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Dave Gilliard, Silva's campaign manager, called the correspondence "a 
shakedown letter. There's still a lot votes between now" and when Young and 
Pickler step down.

CHILDREN ALONE NEARLY 3 DAYS WITH DEAD MOTHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

 Frightened, confused and apparently convinced at first that their mother "was 
sleeping and didn't want to wake up," three young children survived alone for 
almost three days in a Westlake district apartment as their mother lay dead on 
the floor, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The children, ages 3 years, 2 years, and 5 months, were discovered about 9:45 
a.m. Tuesday after the 3-year-old knocked on the door of a neighbor, who became 
alarmed and dialed 911. 
</P>
<P>
 Paramedics burst into the reeking apartment in the 500 block of South Bonnie 
Brae Street to find "a 36-year-old woman in an advanced state of 
decomposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Brian Humphrey, a spokesman for the Fire Department, said the children had 
apparently lived off scraps scavenged from the refrigerator by the 3-year-old. 
Officials said the entire unit was littered with bits of food. 
</P>
<P>
 One neighbor reported that the eldest boy had told her his mother "had a heart 
attack." 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office said that although the cause of death has not been 
determined, there were no signs of foul play. The woman recently had been under 
the care of a physician, who said he had been treating her for a serious heart 
condition, according to Scott Carrier, a spokesman for the coroner's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their gruesome ordeal, the children were in remarkably good condition, 
Humphrey said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a miracle nothing (worse) happened to the children," said a neighbor, 
Bernice Napoles. 
</P>
<P>
 Humphrey said the youngest child "was in a somewhat dehydrated condition, but 
otherwise all right. The other two . . . were in good condition. It appeared 
that the 3-year-old had been taking care of the others." 
</P>
<P>
 The children were examined at California Hospital Medical Center and 
transferred to the care of the Department of Children's Services, officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The identities of the woman and children were withheld pending notification of 
next of kin. Officials said they believed that the children's father was 
arrested several months ago and may be in jail. They said the dead woman may 
have had a sister in the East. 
</P>
<P>
 Sonia Gallardo, 19, a friend of the victim, said she last saw the woman 
Saturday night when the two paused to talk outside the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "She told me she was going to have an operation," Gallardo said. "She was 
supposed to call me about an hour later, but she never did." 
</P>
<P>
 Juliana Saravia, 12, who frequently ran errands for the ailing woman, said she 
too had been concerned. Juliana said she stopped by the apartment Sunday to see 
if everything was all right, but the 3-year-old "told me that she was sleeping 
and didn't want to wake up." 
</P>
<P>
 By Monday, police said, neighbors had begun to complain about the noise from a 
television set that had been blaring in the apartment since Saturday night. 
They also complained about a disagreeable odor that seemed to grow stronger by 
the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 After the 3-year-old alerted the neighbor, paramedics found the woman's body 
sprawled face-down on the floor beside her bed.

3 LAWS INSPIRED BY ANTONOVICH CASE SIGNED; ETHICS: GOVERNOR ENACTS THREE BILLS 
MAKING OFFICIALS LIABLE FOR COURT DAMAGES ARISING FROM MISCONDUCT. THEY STEM 
FROM 1993 CASE, NOW ON APPEAL, IN WHICH THE SUPERVISOR CALLED A JUDGE ON BEHALF 
OF A CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson has signed three bills protecting taxpayers from court 
damages incurred by elected officials found liable for misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The bills were inspired by a 1993 case in which a jury found Los Angeles 
County Supervisor Mike Antonovich liable for conspiring to influence a judge on 
behalf of a campaign contributor. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the case is being appealed, county lawyers have agreed to pay an 
unspecified portion of the $1.2 million in compensatory damages that were 
awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 The new laws specify that government entities, like counties or cities, do not 
have to pay damages if their elected officials get themselves into trouble by 
actions ranging from intervening in court cases to engaging in sexual 
harassment to committing a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 If an elected official is unable to afford the court costs, public agencies 
still have the option of making the payments, but the new laws require them to 
seek reimbursement from the official. 
</P>
<P>
 "It serves notice to all politicians . . . statewide that the taxpayers will 
not be left holding the bag for improprieties," said Sean Walsh, Wilson's 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) wrote the bill, AB 2467, that 
most closely mirrors the circumstances of the Antonovich case. It specifically 
targets cases in which elected officials try to intervene in a judicial 
proceeding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Under this bill, any elected official who chooses to intervene in a court 
proceeding will do so at his or her own financial risk -- not at the risk of 
the taxpayers' wallets," Bowen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich was not available for comment, but a spokesman said he favored such 
changes in the law. The new laws, however, will not retroactively apply to the 
Antonovich case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We supported these bills because they would bring an end to frivolous 
lawsuits against deep pocket entities," said Steven Herbert, Antonovich's 
spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich, a supervisor since 1980, says he did nothing improper five years 
ago when he telephoned a judge to put in a good word for campaign contributor 
Krikor Suri and his jewelry business partners. Suri and his associates were 
involved in a lawsuit against another partner. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Campaign reports show that Suri and his companies contributed $19,000 to 
Antonovich's campaigns from 1985 to 1989, loaned him $10,000 about a month 
before he called the judge and made a $3,000 contribution four days before he 
called. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months after Antonovich's phone call, Judge Eric Younger excused himself 
from the lawsuit, explaining in a deposition that he felt "uncomfortable about 
the call either having an impact or the appearance of an impact." 
</P>
<P>
 Businessman Avedis Kasparian, who opposed Suri in the first lawsuit, then 
filed a new suit against Antonovich, the county, Suri and his partners, 
complaining that he lost money because the judge was influenced by Antonovich. 
A Norwalk Superior Court jury agreed, holding the defendants liable for $1.2 
million in compensatory damages. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Richard Katz (D-Sylmar) wrote one of the other two bills, AB 2508, 
limiting government liability, but his was broader than Bowen's and would also 
cover cases of sexual harassment, sexual battery and attempts to inflict 
emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz took note not only of the Antonovich case but also of a sexual harassment 
lawsuit pending against Los Angeles City Councilman Nate Holden. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message I wanted to send was that public officials who screw up cannot 
expect taxpayers to pay up for them," Katz said. "People who behave unethically 
and illegally should be held accountable and they ought to pay up first." 
</P>
<P>
 The third bill in the package, AB 2522, was written by Assemblyman Paul 
Horcher (R-Diamond Bar). Although Horcher told a legislative committee it 
stemmed in part from his concerns over the Antonovich case, he said it more 
directly addressed wrongdoing by municipal elected officials -- such as one 
city councilman who sued constituents for trying to recall him. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher's bill states that government entities will be liable for neither 
damages nor defense costs if an elected official is convicted of a felony.

REACTION MILD TO MARATHON'S MONEY LAUNDERING; ETHICS: SEVERAL OFFICIALS PRAISE 
FIRM'S MANAGEMENT OF THE RACE, BUT TWO CALL FOR A REVIEW OF COMPANY'S CONTRACT 
WITH THE CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The revelation that the Los Angeles Marathon laundered political contributions 
evoked muted concern Tuesday among Los Angeles officials, with many saying they 
consider the annual race a major success and do not want to tamper with its 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Several key City Council members said Los Angeles Marathon Inc. has run the 
event successfully and smoothly for the last nine years, regardless of the 
admission Monday that the firm had illegally concealed that it was the source 
of $73,000 in campaign contributions from 1989 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they did with illegal contributions is beyond me," said Councilman Zev 
Yaroslavsky. "As a councilman and as a marathoner myself, I can say that 
(marathon President William Burke) runs a first-class operation. He brings 
20,000 people into the city, doesn't cause any problems, cleans up promptly and 
does everything he is asked to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Council President John Ferraro and Councilman Hal Bernson also praised Burke 
for building the marathon from modest roots into an internationally recognized 
event. Yaroslavsky said a review of the operation is warranted only if the 
public demands it "to restore confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Joel Wachs, in contrast, said Burke has "a major character flaw" 
for allowing the money laundering operation to go on and said he plans to 
review the marathon's contract "with a fine-tooth comb." 
</P>
<P>
 City Controller Rick Tuttle also said he will review the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The concerns were voiced a day after the city Ethics Commission and state Fair 
Political Practices Commission announced twin settlements in which the marathon 
and one of its former top employees admitted to concealing that the firm was 
the source of 137 campaign contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke was not cited personally for money laundering, but he signed the 
settlements on behalf of the organization he heads, which agreed to pay a 
$436,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
 The secret contributions allowed the marathon to give thousands of dollars 
more to candidates than permitted under the city's campaign finance law. Most 
of the money was funneled to City Council candidates and others around the time 
that the council was extending the marathon's contract. 
</P>
<P>
 While political leaders were mostly sanguine about the city's relationship 
with the marathon, interviews with city bureaucrats indicated that the event's 
organizers may not be meeting all the terms of their contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The city official charged with monitoring the contract with Los Angeles 
Marathon Inc. said in an interview that the firm has not filed quarterly 
reports on its payment of a licensing fee to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1991 contract amendment, the marathon agreed to pay a $300,000 annual 
licensing fee, not in cash but in free billboard and bus board advertising 
space. City operations such as the Los Angeles Zoo can use the advertising 
space to promote exhibits or new programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But John Duggan, an analyst in the city administrative office, said Tuesday 
that the marathon firm filed only one of the required quarterly reports, in 
1991, and has not filed any since. Duggan said the initial report from the 
marathon "had problems," although he said he could not recall Tuesday what they 
were. As a result, he decided to have city departments report on the free 
advertising they received from the marathon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those reports showed that the city got $297,000 worth of billboard space in 
1991. But Duggan said Tuesday he could not confirm whether the city received 
the billboard space promised in the last three years. However, he said he was 
confident that further review of his files would reveal that the marathon has 
met its advertising obligation to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Marathon officials arranged to meet the billboard requirement through a deal 
with Patrick Media, the giant of that industry, Duggan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The marathon officials promise in their contract to supply the ad space free 
and "not conditioned on any advertising purchases by the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet on Tuesday, the Los Angeles Zoo official in charge of advertising said the 
zoo had paid $150,000 to Patrick Media in fiscal year 1993-94 as part of the 
"free" advertising deal. After buying that ad space, the zoo did get "at least" 
another $150,000 in free space through the billboard firm, said Lora LaMarca, 
the zoo's public information director. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she expects to pay about $100,000 this year in order to obtain a like 
amount of "free" ad space promised by the marathon. 
</P>
<P>
 Duggan said such an arrangement would violate the marathon's promise to 
provide the city with free advertising. Members of the City Council objected 
three years ago when they learned that the "free" ads came with strings 
attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke, through his attorney, declined comment. Other marathon officials did 
not return repeated phone calls. Patrick Media also could not be reached for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlements with the FPPC and the city Ethics Commission described a 
pattern for most of the illicit donations. 
</P>
<P>
 Marathon representatives Burke, George Beasley and Marie Patrick, described as 
an officer in the company, would authorize payments from the marathon to 
Beasley, once a top employee at the firm. Marathon employees, their relatives 
and others would then give donations to political officials and be reimbursed 
by Beasley. Among those who made the payments to candidates were Burke's 
parents, Edna and Leonard. 
</P>
<P>
 FPPC Chief of Enforcement Daryl East said Tuesday that at an early stage of 
the investigation he believed Burke probably knew marathon money was being 
laundered. But East said the investigation never developed direct evidence that 
Burke guided the illegal contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Tuesday, some details emerged of the relationship between Burke and 
Oakland Mayor Elihu Harris, who received more than $20,000 in laundered 
marathon contributions, according to the settlements. In the 1970s, Harris 
worked as a congressional staff member for Burke's wife, Yvonne Brathwaite 
Burke, who is now a Los Angeles County supervisor, said a Harris political 
associate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oakland mayor has "been family friends with both Yvonne and Bill Burke for 
a couple of decades," said Alameda County Supervisor Don Perata. "When (Harris) 
ran for mayor he asked his friends to give a hand in fund raising," Perata 
said, and managed to collect more than $1 million. Through a spokesman, Harris 
declined to comment Tuesday, instead issuing a statement stressing that there 
has been no evidence he knew the contributions were improper.

POLICE PANEL CALLS FOR SEX HARASSMENT, BIAS UNIT; LAPD: A COMMITTEE RECOMMENDS 
AN INDEPENDENT DIVISION TO INVESTIGATE INTERNAL ACCUSATIONS. COMMISSION VOTE IS 
DELAYED SO WILLIAMS CAN STUDY THE PLAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In response to growing complaints about sexual harassment and discrimination 
within the Los Angeles Police Department, the Police Commission is considering 
the creation of a unit that would strip the LAPD of primary responsibility for 
investigating those charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a proposal painstakingly drafted by an ad hoc committee consisting of 
commission members Deirdre Hill and Art Mattox, the unit proposed Tuesday would 
be responsible for investigating all discrimination and harassment complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be housed outside any existing LAPD facility -- a move intended to 
reassure employees making complaints that they would not be subject to 
retaliation and that their complaints would be treated confidentially. 
</P>
<P>
 A scheduled vote on the proposed unit was delayed for a week Tuesday after 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams asked the commission for more time to study the 
proposal and Asst. City Atty. Byron R. Boeckman advised the panel that the 
public may not have been given adequate notice of the vote as required by state 
law. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams said he supported creating the unit, but he took exception to 
removing it from the day-to-day operation of the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sends a chilling message to the 10,000 employees of the department when 
you say: 'None of you can be trusted to conduct an investigation,' " he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, Williams would be given authority to review any 
disciplinary action recommended against a department employee. But initial 
investigative responsibility for all complaints of harassment and racial and 
sexual discrimination would lie with the new unit, which would report to the 
Police Commission -- not the Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed unit represents a compromise between advocates of placing the 
entire process within the Police Department and those who argue that it should 
be completely independent of the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel very strongly that we need to create this unit in the Police 
Commission," commission President Enrique Hernandez Jr. said at Tuesday's 
meeting, adding that he would not want that misinterpreted as distrust of 
department employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams argued that the public and Police Department employees "expect the 
chief to know about complaints and to do something right away." Taking the unit 
out of the department's chain of command "flies in the face of the 
responsibility and accountability" the public expects from the department's 
command staff, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill disagreed, saying the commission must play a role in establishing what 
the standards of the department will be. Moreover, she said, the department 
focuses on discipline while the new unit will pay more attention to the needs 
of victims of discrimination and harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Mattox reminded Williams that under the committee's proposal he would be 
notified of any complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Commission member Rabbi Gary Greenebaum noted that "the department is 
changing, but it has not yet completed its change. Until that time, we need to 
provide some sort of sanctuary where people feel comfortable coming forward." 
</P>
<P>
 The new unit would have 13 staffers, including one police officer, and an 
annual budget of $662,000 if it is approved and fully funded by the City 
Council. The proposal also recommends that cases referred to Internal Affairs 
be assigned two investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg told the commission that she thinks the council 
wants the unit established and that she will take personal responsibility for 
initiating discussions about funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed unit would represent the LAPD's most serious commitment of 
resources to rooting out sexual harassment and discrimination within its ranks 
and would mark the Police Commission's most assertive step toward having its 
staff investigate internal LAPD complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 The report, presented to the full commission Tuesday, states that the ad hoc 
committee's "response to recurring criticism of the present system is to offer 
a process that provides for appropriate consideration of the victim by shifting 
the focus of the investigation from discipline to compliance with city and 
department policies and the tenets of employment discrimination law." 
</P>
<P>
 Creation of the unit has been widely discussed since early this year, when the 
LAPD embarked on an aggressive attempt to root out sexual harassment at one of 
its police stations and news reports documented an array of harassment and 
discrimination complaints arising from the ranks. But the commission's 
recommended unit differs in important respects from one outlined by Williams in 
previous interviews and public statements. 
</P>
<P>
 Most significantly, Williams had suggested that any new investigative unit 
needed to report to him in order to tackle delicate personnel issues raised by 
sexual harassment and discrimination complaints. The commission, backed by many 
council members and outside observers who worried that a new unit within the 
LAPD would lack credibility, chose a different course. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the commission proposal, Williams would retain the ability to discipline 
any department employee who was found guilty of discrimination or harassment. 
But investigation of those complaints would rest with the commission unit; LAPD 
Internal Affairs investigators would only handle those cases referred to them 
by the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the unit's structure would differ from Williams' proposal, 
commissioners praised the chief for his dedication to tackling harassment and 
said they believed the unit would effectively handle that task. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been lucky to have a chief of police who has taken aggressive steps to 
say that sexual harassment will not be tolerated," Hill said. "The practical 
realities of this issue are that the unit has to be responsive and has to be 
trusted." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill said she hopes the council will support the unit and approve funding for 
it quickly. If that happens, she said, the department could bring a consultant 
on board within a month to begin laying the groundwork for establishing the 
unit. 
</P>
<P>
 That could clear the way for the unit to be up and running within six months, 
Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners are sensitive to the city's formidable budget problems, Hill and 
others said, but also noted that lawsuits alleging discrimination and 
harassment have been costing the city increasingly large sums to defend and 
settle in recent years. By comparison, Hill added, the unit is a relative 
bargain.

CHEAPER BRACES NO SAVINGS FOR MTA; TRANSPORTATION: THE AGENCY DID NOT DEMAND 
FINANCIAL CONCESSIONS WHEN IT ALLOWED A CONTRACTOR TO USE LESS COSTLY WOOD 
BRACES INSTEAD OF METAL, RECORDS SHOW. THE MATERIAL IS BLAMED FOR CONTRIBUTING 
TO THE SINKAGE IN HOLLYWOOD. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority demanded no financial 
concessions when they permitted a contractor to use cheaper and inferior 
building materials for the bracing of subway tunnels under construction beneath 
Hollywood Boulevard and Vermont Avenue, records and interviews show. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers working on behalf of the MTA allowed the contractor to use wood 
wedges instead of metal struts for the bracing. But officials did not require 
the contractor, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, to compensate the transit agency for the 
resulting savings. 
</P>
<P>
 The wood wedges failed within a 200-foot-long section of Hollywood Boulevard 
last month, and project officials have said that the crushing of the wood 
helped cause significant surface sinkage in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrea Greene, an MTA spokeswoman, said agency officials stand by their 
decision two years ago not to seek a credit from the contractor for its 
substitution of the less-expensive wood bracing. "The (agency) was not eligible 
for a credit in this case," Greene said. "The bid documents called for 
structural steel or other approved struts. The contractor provided an approved 
alternative." 
</P>
<P>
 Shea-Kiewit-Kenny won the contract to construct 12 miles of twin tunnels 
connecting Wilshire Boulevard with Hollywood Boulevard two years ago with a bid 
of $165 million. 
</P>
<P>
 After Times inquiries last week, MTA Chief Executive Officer Franklin E. White 
announced Monday that tests of the wood wedges have found that the material 
"failed to meet its specified strength." 
</P>
<P>
 White said he intends to retain outside specialists by the end of the week to 
help investigate why the wood was not as strong as it was supposed to be. He 
also said he would review the decision to substitute wood wedges for metal 
struts, which were required originally by the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the contractor, Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, did not return calls 
seeking comment. They previously have declined to discuss any of their work on 
the subway. 
</P>
<P>
 Metro Rail contract documents show that when a contractor substitutes a 
less-expensive material "in comparison with the product specified," the company 
should propose "equitable adjustment and credit" to the transit agency. 
</P>
<P>
 Other contractors reached by The Times said that the substitution of wood 
wedges for steel struts to fill expansion gaps in the outer concrete tunnel 
shell provided a cost savings. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, the contractor who submitted the second-lowest bid for the work, 
Tutor-Saliba Corp., based its proposal on the assumption that metal struts were 
required, according to company President Ronald N. Tutor. "We bid it on that 
basis," Tutor said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another contractor with Los Angeles subway experience, Michael L. Shank, said 
that before he built 15,000 feet of tunnels now open to passengers Downtown, 
between Pershing Square and MacArthur Park, he considered and then rejected the 
use of wood wedges in the expansion gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Shank said he estimated at the time that the wood wedges would have cost a 
maximum of $20 per four feet of tunneling, compared to about $60 feet for metal 
struts. 
</P>
<P>
 Shank said he decided not to use the wedges because he did not believe any 
wood product would meet the strength requirements. "We just could not satisfy 
ourselves that it would calculate to hold the loads," Shank said. "Nor did we 
think the (transit agency) would approve it because we couldn't demonstrate 
that it would hold the loads." 
</P>
<P>
 Shank and Metro Rail officials said his company was required to test, to the 
point of destruction, the metal struts that would be used to demonstrate their 
strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineering experts, including Prof. John F. Hall of Caltech, told The Times 
that the hardwood oak wedges proposed as a substitute for the metal struts in 
Hollywood "appear to be inadequate to bear the full weight of the soil." 
</P>
<P>
 The wood does not have the compressive strength of 1,500 pounds per square 
inch assumed under the contract revision, according to experts. Oak typically 
has less than half that much strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Tunneling along Hollywood Boulevard has been shut down since Aug. 18. The 
problems that two days later forced evacuation of one of the twin tunnels are 
the subject of investigations by local and federal officials. The subway work 
is financed with federal, state and local funds. 
</P>
<P>
 It has yet to be determined whether the contractor or the transit agency will 
have to pay for what are expected to be millions of dollars of repairs to the 
damaged tunnels, to the street and to buildings within a nine-block-long area 
of Hollywood Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Los Angeles City Council on Tuesday approved spending $50,000 
to hire its own engineer to review the plans for preventing any further 
problems from subway tunneling beneath Hollywood.

FAITH IS THE HUNTER; CRASH: STUDENTS URGE U.S. AUTHORITIES TO BEGIN NEW SEARCH 
FOR FIVE MEN, INCLUDING A TEACHER'S BROTHER, WHOSE PLANE VANISHED IN BOLIVIAN 
JUNGLE IN MAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As unlikely as it may be, the lives of five men missing in a Bolivian rain 
forest could rest in the hands of 860 Compton schoolchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 The men are members of an environmental research team whose small plane 
disappeared May 7 in a mountain jungle and triggered a search effort that was 
suspended a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The children are pupils at the Ralph Bunche Middle School who have each 
written a letter to President Clinton asking that the United States reactivate 
the search. 
</P>
<P>
 Youngsters are rallying around sixth-grade teacher Alfonso Soruco -- whose 
brother is among those who have been swallowed up by the thick forest at the 
edge of the Andes Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Soruco is convinced that there is evidence that 41-year-old Bolivian 
environmental engineer Julio Soruco and the others are alive in a jungle so 
dense that those on the ground cannot see the sky. 
</P>
<P>
 "And if he's not alive, I'm certain some of the others who were on the plane 
are," said Soruco, 32, of Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 Soruco was busy Tuesday in his Mona Boulevard classroom collecting reams of 
computer paper on which the students have written their pleas to the President. 
Unfurled, the 17 strips of paper containing an estimated 900,000 words filled 
the floor of the school's multipurpose room. 
</P>
<P>
 His classroom walls are covered with posters identifying the crash victims and 
the apparent map coordinates of their crash site. On a table in the back of the 
room is a cardboard mock-up of a jungle with tiny toy helicopters dangling over 
paper trees. A pasteboard replica of a satellite hangs from the ceiling by a 
string. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the satellite that has given Soruco and other victims' relatives hope 
that the five are alive. They are convinced that a secret U.S. spy satellite 
zeroed in on the Cessna fuselage and photographed a campfire, water ditch and 
part of a rock "mayday" sign made by the victims. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash site's high elevation, rugged terrain and tall trees have made 
rescue efforts difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 Four volunteer Bolivian searchers were killed when their similar Cessna 
crashed while hunting for the environmentalists -- who were working with the 
World Bank to trace the source of gold miners' mercury pollution in mountain 
rivers. Along with Julio Soruco, the missing men include a Bolivian pilot, a 
Bolivian official, a Canadian scientist and Harvey Olem, a 38-year-old 
environmental engineer from Herndon, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivian fliers have briefly hovered over the site and photographed what 
appears to be huts. But there was no place to land so searchers could look on 
foot, said Soruco -- who spent his three-month school vacation in Bolivia 
assisting the search. 
</P>
<P>
 Bolivian soldiers got to within a few miles of the site before several were 
injured in falls and the expedition was called off. A helicopter borrowed from 
Peru had the ability to fly at the high altitude, but it was not large enough 
to carry enough rescuers who could rappel to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The youngsters are urging Clinton to authorize the use of heavy-duty U.S. 
helicopters, along with a trained rescue team able to descend by ropes from the 
craft. 
</P>
<P>
 "By now, they must be weak and frustrated. Please help them. Please rescue 
them," wrote sixth-grader Teresa Perez. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixth-grader Tia Stuart said the missing environmentalists are heroes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need those people. Just look at the people they were trying to save. The 
mercury was killing people and they went to go clean up all that stuff," she 
wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 The search-and-rescue drama has captured the imagination of the whole school, 
according to teacher Jay Hewlett -- who sent a computer e-mail message late 
Tuesday to the White House to alert officials that the children's letters would 
be sent Thursday by an overnight shipping service. 
</P>
<P>
 Math teachers have turned it into arithmetic lessons. ("If you hiked 2.5 miles 
for 3 days, 3 miles for 2 days and 2 miles for 5 days, what was your average 
distance per day?") Science classes have discussed subjects such as satellite 
operation and jungle vegetation. Social studies teachers have explored the 
culture and terrain of Bolivia and English teachers have issued reading 
assignments for books such as "Swiss Family Robinson." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to instill in the kids that this is the way to get things done 
-- band together," Principal Ellie Campbell said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Campbell acknowledged that the children's letters may have no effect in 
Washington. And even if the search is renewed, there's no guarantee that anyone 
will be found alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids are prepared. They don't expect the President to drop everything. 
They know the search might not be successful," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, according to one search-and-rescue expert who spent more than two 
weeks looking for the downed plane in June, there is "a zero chance" that a 
renewed hunt will pay off. 
</P>
<P>
 Stan Voyiaziakis, a retired Air Force lieutenant colonel from Alexandria, Va., 
who is a Civil Air Patrol commander and search consultant, was hired by the 
World Bank to hunt for the plane June 7.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's very treacherous. It's a triple-canopy forest -- you can hover over the 
site and still not see anything," Voyiaziakis said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 He added that the satellite imaging thought to be that of the Cessna could be 
from any of 20 or so aircraft that have been reported missing over the years in 
the jungle. 
</P>
<P>
 But Soruco -- who was born in Bolivia -- is not giving up. And neither are his 
young friends at the middle school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The missing people have children waiting for them," 12-year-old Banessa 
Duarte said. "The government needs to get going."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: BREA; INPUT SOUGHT ON PLAN OFFERING LOANS TO HOMEOWNERS

<P>
 Community input is being sought on the future of the city's housing 
rehabilitation loan program, which provides federal funds to local property 
owners for home repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 A meeting to solicit ideas, questions and comments from the public is 
scheduled for 5:30 p.m. Oct. 5 in the conference center at the Brea Civic & 
Cultural Center, 1 Civic Center Circle. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always want to see what the input from the community is," said Pat Stokes, 
a housing rehabilitation specialist for the city. "There might be a street that 
needs a lot of roofs, for instance. We do have a little flexibility, not a lot, 
and we want to know we're headed in the right direction." 
</P>
<P>
 Brea's housing rehabilitation program, which began in 1977, provides low- or 
deferred-interest loans on the basis of home equity and financial need. Loans 
typically range from $10,000 to $20,000, Stokes said, and are often used for 
roof and plumbing repairs, painting and similar projects. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can't go into frills," such as patios, Stokes said. "The program is mainly 
to preserve the housing stock within the city." 
</P>
<P>
 Additional information on the public input meeting or the loan program is 
available from Stokes at (714) 671-4461. ALAN EYERLY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SUPERVISORS GIVE FINAL OK TO BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors on Tuesday gave final approval to a $3.7-billion 
budget plan amid concerns that the state might still claim county revenue to 
balance its books. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's budget, which officials have hailed as the rosiest in three 
years, calls for the creation of more than 900 county jobs.In the last few 
years, the county has cut 2,000 jobs from its work force. 
</P>
<P>
 The new budget also maintains spending at current levels for most programs. 
</P>
<P>
 But county officials said Tuesday that the budget picture could darken 
considerably if the state's budget falls out of balance by more than 1%. Such 
an imbalance would trigger automatic state cuts in revenue to the county, 
forcing the county to reduce its own budget. 
</P>
<P>
 "We really need to proceed with caution," said Supervisor William G. Steiner, 
who last week attended a meeting of the California State Assn. of Counties in 
which the state's financial outlook was discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner said that the state's $57-billion budget is within $56 million of 
triggering cutbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The state failed to receive about $400 million from the federal government to 
pay for the jailing of felons who are illegal immigrants, Steiner said. 
</P>
<P>
 State revenue is running about $377 million higher than estimated. But 
officials fear that property tax revenue could eventually fall because many 
homeowners are having their properties reassessed to lower values. 
</P>
<P>
 Steiner recommended that the county conduct a monthly review of its budget 
instead of waiting for the customary mid-year check in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The county will also attempt to delay the hiring of about 200 workers until 
Nov. 15, when the state will issue a "report card" on its budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200 jobs include positions in the Orange County Sheriff's Department, 
Social Services Agency and Health Care Agency.SHELBY GRAD

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY COUNCIL OKS CHARTER CRUISE TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HOLLY J. WAGNER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A controversial head tax on Newport Harbor charter cruises squeaked past the 
City Council on Monday night, over the objections of several charter boat 
owners who said they are struggling to keep their industry afloat. 
</P>
<P>
 The 80 Newport Beach charter companies subject to the new tax will have to pay 
50 cents per passenger on tickets priced $26 to $50 and $1 each for tickets of 
$50 or more. Charters based elsewhere will have to pay $50 for up to 50 
passengers and $100 for 50 or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Charter owners complained that the tax, which takes effect in 30 days, will 
force them to raise prices beyond what the market will bear. 
</P>
<P>
 "Be it brides, be it corporations, we are constantly being asked for (price) 
adjustments" by customers, said Debra Schoonmaker, who owns a one-woman 
operation. Corporations decide whether to charter a boat "based on $100 to 
$200. They are nickel-and-diming." 
</P>
<P>
 Charter owner Roy King said Long Beach charged a $580 fee for a recent 
four-hour tour he took there, "but that was because I was from out of the 
harbor. I was a transit," he said. More of the burden should fall to outside 
charters, he and others said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Harbor Area Chamber of Commerce's Marine Division, which claims 
most charter owners as members and worked with the city for months on the 
ordinance, withdrew its support at the last minute because of an exemption for 
sportfishing and whale watching boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman John W. Hedges warned those companies that they could be taxed 
eventually and keeping silent would not spare them. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you think that feeding the alligators is going to cause you to be eaten 
last, I have a feeling you're in for a rude awakening," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He and council members Phil Sansone and Evelyn R. Hart voted against the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Janice A. Debay voted for the tax but said she would work to 
shift more of the cost to out-of-town operators. 
</P>
<P>
 She also asked city staff to seek ways to provide parking and a public dock, 
so the city could collect use fees now paid to private parties rather than a 
tax. HOLLY J. WAGNER

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; 
ANTONOVICH, MOLINA FEUD HITS NEW PITCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Supervisors Gloria Molina and Mike Antonovich on Tuesday set a new standard 
for public animus in their rocky three-year relationship after she filed a 
motion that would have required him to pay for frequent flights on county 
helicopters. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich's sprawling 5th Supervisorial District spans the northern frontier 
of the county, stretching from the San Bernardino County line to Ventura County 
and north to Kern County. It is a land area more than twice as large as Rhode 
Island and difficult to get around. 
</P>
<P>
 The motion, calling for amplification of a county policy adopted in 1991 that 
requires officials to reimburse the cost of copter rides, broke one of the 
unwritten customs at the tradition-bound Hall of Administration: One supervisor 
does not tell another how to run his or her district. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Molina's motion died for lack of a second -- but not before 
a testy public hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Isn't his chauffeur-driven car good enough?" Molina asked. "It has a phone in 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich countered that his district is so large he would be on the freeway 
for hours a day just getting to places. And to pay for rides on copters from 
the Sheriff's and Fire departments out of his office budget would only take 
money away from other important social and law enforcement programs, he argued. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a pitiful response," Molina shot back. "The reality is, we have a 
budget that everyone is expected to live under. That includes you. You are not 
special. You are not unique." 
</P>
<P>
 Molina said she was unable to get a second for her motion because Antonovich 
"was able to solicit other members to cover up this indiscretion." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Supervisor Ed Edelman said the lack of a second "just showed 
that this is a matter of concern between the 5th and 1st districts and everyone 
else decided not to get involved." 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich said his colleagues were "embarrassed by (Molina's) tirade, her 
emotional outburst. . . . It was pathetic. I was disappointed by her lack of 
professionalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Antonovich said the board needs members "who can attack problems and not 
individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, Molina said: "There's too much weight on personalities. It's all 
about issues." FREDERICK M. MUIR

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NEIGHBORHOOD CLEANUP 
PROGRAM GOES CITYWIDE 
</P>

<P>
 Raul Ramirez is a rarity -- an 11-year-old who likes to clean. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Saturdays and Sundays I always clean my back yard," Ramirez boasted. When 
he strolls through his Eastsideneighborhood, he frequently gets the urge to 
pick up trash. 
</P>
<P>
 So he's perfect for Operation Sparkle, the Los Angeles Police Department's 
citywide cleanup effort that will mobilize an estimated 20,000 volunteers in 
October. Planners hope to remove more than 30 tons of trash and cover graffiti 
in L.A.'s blighted areas with about 20,000 gallons of paint. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez and other schoolchildren were on hand Tuesday to scoop up debris along 
the 6th Street Bridge on the Eastside while members of the LAPD and Mayor 
Richard Riordan praised the program, which will officially begin on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Attacking the dead branches and dust on the side of the bridge, Nick Chavez 
paused to explain why he was shoveling dirt in the Los Angeles sun. "People are 
always saying East L.A. is so dirty," said the 18-year-old senior at Salesian 
High School. "I was born and raised here, and comments like that give a very 
negative image of East L.A. It makes it look like there's a lot of gang 
violence, and there's not, but there are a lot of people who want to help make 
things better, and that's ignored." 
</P>
<P>
 Operation Sparkle has been an annual event in the LAPD's Valley Bureau since 
1989, but this is the first year it has gone citywide. On the next four 
Saturdays, Operation Sparkle will hit the neighborhoods in each of the LAPD's 
four bureaus. They will clean areas in the South Bureau on Oct. 1, the Valley 
Bureau on Oct. 8, the West Bureau on Oct. 15 and the Central Bureau on Oct. 22. 
The program will culminate with a family festival at the L.A. Zoo on Oct. 29. 
For information on participating, call (800) 749-CITY. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you have a clean community, it sends a signal that you care," said 
Police Chief Willie L. Williams, "that you're not going to tolerate nonsense in 
your neighborhood, you're not going to tolerate crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Police Chief Mark Kroeker, who started Operation Sparkle when he was 
head of the Valley Bureau, issued a challenge to other cities: "Let's see if 
you can get as many people out to clean up your neighborhoods as we do in 
October!" 
</P>
<P>
 The operation is funded with $150,000 in grant money from corporations such as 
Chrysler (which is also offering to provide transportation for volunteers) and 
the Los Angeles Waste Management Corp. The city is putting an estimated 
$150,000 of its resources into the effort. NICHOLAS RICCARDI

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COUNTY SUPERVISORS MOVE 
TOWARD RESCINDING LIBRARY TAX 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FREDERICK M. MUIR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A deeply divided Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday took the 
first step toward rescinding a library tax, but left unclear whether it would 
follow through and overturn the $16-million property assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 In a raucous hourlong debate marked by personal attacks and shifting 
alliances, the board ordered the county tax collector to halt the annual 
mailing of tax bills until the matter can be sorted out.  
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the deliberations became so strained that Supervisor Mike 
Antonovich joked that he was going to bring in former President Jimmy Carter to 
negotiate a truce. "And the troops," added Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end the board voted to hold a public hearing Oct. 14 on a motion to 
strike the tax. That session will come six weeks after the board held hearings 
to establish the tax. 
</P>
<P>
 Reconsideration of the library tax will push the county bureaucracy to the 
limit of its ability to get 2.5 million tax bills prepared and mailed in a 
timely manner, according to Treasurer/Tax Collector Larry Montheilh. Normally, 
the mailing process is begun on the fourth Monday of September to make sure 
that property owners receive statements before the Nov. 1 due date. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Supervisor Gloria Molina intervened to halt the property tax 
mailing, saying bureaucrats were attempting to sneak through the tax that she 
maintained had only been tentatively approved on Aug. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The assessment would affect property owners in the unincorporated county areas 
and 16 cities that opted to join the assessment district. The annual fee would 
cost the average homeowner about $28.50 and could run as high as several 
hundred or even a few thousand dollars for large commercial or industrial 
properties. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, Molina charged that county officials were involved in a movida, 
Spanish for "crooked deal." When the board voted 3 to 2 to establish the 
assessment, Molina said, she made it clear it was to come back to the board for 
review before being included on tax bills. However, transcripts from that 
meeting show that officials had warned Molina that any reconsideration had to 
be completed by mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 When that did not happen, the officials made plans to follow the normal tax 
bill timetable, Montheilh said. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the discussion, Molina said that she has not decided how to vote 
on the matter. Molina provided the swing vote for approval, and is likely to 
again cast the pivotal ballot. She said her decision will rest largely on how 
much of a surplus county officials find as they prepare to close the books on 
the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Ed Edelman said he was disappointed by the prospect that the tax 
may be rescinded because it could again leave the libraries underfunded. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's 89-branch library system has lost 50% of its funding in the past 
two years as property taxes have been siphoned off for other state and local 
programs. FREDERICK M. MUIR

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; SPENDING 
LIMIT ON PLAQUES FOR SLAIN OFFICERS LIFTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prompted by the outrage of police over an austere memorial to a rookie police 
officer killed in the line of duty, the Los Angeles City Council voted 
unanimously Tuesday to eliminate a spending restriction on memorial plaques for 
slain police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation by Councilman Joel Wachs modifies the law that had provided 
only enough money -- about $200 -- to mount the officer's badge on a plaque, 
which was given to the family at the officer's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, the city will pay to include the officer's gun, medals, 
pins, whistles and any other personal items requested by the slain officer's 
family and friends. The memorials, known as "shadow boxes," would cost no more 
than $500 each, Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than just a matter of money. It is a matter of appreciation and 
respect," the councilman said. The motion is expected to be signed into law 
today by Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs' attention was drawn to the law by police officers and friends of 
Officer Christy Hamilton, who were outraged when they learned they had to pay 
to include more than a badge on a framed plaque. Hamilton, a rookie officer, 
was killed while responding Feb. 22 to a domestic dispute call in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers who helped arrange Hamilton's memorial plaque and funeral said that 
while trying to raise money for the fancier plaque, they found that many 
officers were so financially strapped by home damage from the Northridge quake 
that they had little to donate. They opted for the free version, but under the 
new law will present a more elaborate one to Hamilton's family in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Zine, a director for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said it 
is not generally known among officers that the city has only been willing to 
pay for the simpler plaque. But that restriction, he said, has "been symbolic 
of how the city treats its employees."

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: EL MONTE; MONTH-OLD BOY 
FOUND SAFE 1 WEEK AFTER KIDNAPING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A one-month-old boy was found safe in Las Vegas on Tuesday after being 
kidnaped from an El Monte motel more than a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Otto Ivan Guillermo was abducted from Caesar's Motel on Garvey Avenue by a 
woman who befriended his mother, Christina Macias, 28, and then disappeared 
with the infant, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged kidnaper, who police believe is named Stacey Tomlinson, was 
arrested in Las Vegas on Tuesday morning after El Monte police received a phone 
call from a truck driver who said he had bought the woman a plane ticket to Las 
Vegas. The trucker alerted authorities after hearing radio reports about the 
kidnaping, police said.

SOUGHT IN KILLING OF PRICE CLUB EMPLOYEE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Inglewood police are looking for a man who shot and killed the assistant 
manager of a Price Club store in a street holdup near the store that netted the 
killer and his accomplice $15 in change. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy James Terrian, 37, of Agoura Hills, was shot once in the head about 6:45 
p.m. Saturday while he and another store employee were walking outside the 
store on Century Boulevard across from Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 It was after closing and the other employee was carrying a black cash box 
containing credit card receipts and coins. When confronted by two men, one 
armed with a gun and one with an ice pick, the men handed over the box without 
resisting, Inglewood Police Sgt. Bill Thompson said, but the gunman shot 
Terrian anyway. The other employee fled and was not injured. Terrian died at 
Harbor-UCLA Medical Center.

 Students and parents at Kaiser Primary Center had many reasons to dislike the 
school's old jungle gym, not the least of which were the burns that some 
children received while using the metal playground equipment on hot days. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was with joy this fall that the school dedicated a new jungle gym made 
of colorful plastics and filled with numerous "attractions" such as slides and 
ladders. 
</P>
<P>
 The $18,000 playground was planned and developed by parent volunteers with 
help from the Newport-Mesa Unified School District, which installed the 
equipment free. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers acknowledge that the project would never have been completed if not 
for a $13,000 donation made anonymously to the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The donation really got us started," said parent Maureen Taylor. "We don't 
even know who made the donation." 
</P>
<P>
 The jungle gym includes five separate slides as well as monkey bars and stairs 
for climbing. The equipment is accessible to handicapped people and is 
surrounded by safety mats covered in sand. The playground is encircled by a new 
tricycle trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Local parents had a fund-raiser that produced $3,000, said Taylor, who also 
praised volunteers who drew up architectural plans for the playground. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids love it," Taylor said. "They used to get out of school and go home. 
Now, they like to stay and play on the equipment." SHELBY GRAD

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: RANCHO SANTA MARGARITA; BOYS HOPE HOME OFFERS HAVEN OF 
ORDER, SECURITY AFTER CHAOS

 Miguel looked forward to the junior class ring ceremony at Santa Margarita 
High School this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he learned that his parents were supposed to accompany him. That wouldn't 
be easy for Miguel, one of six out-of-town boys living at Boys Hope, a group 
home for boys whose parents can't care for them. 
</P>
<P>
 So he asked the Boys Hope director, Sister Mary Jean Tucci, to go. She said 
she felt honored. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids need an adult to walk through life with them," Tucci said as she 
supervised the boys' chores and homework at the clean, well-appointed, 
five-bedroom home. "They come from chaos, so here they want a secure 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 The Boys Hope home in Rancho Santa Margarita is in a quiet, gated community 
where kids on in-line skates play pickup hockey games in the cul-de-sacs, and 
Cadillacs and BMWs grace the driveways of large, white, lake-view homes. It's a 
haven for Miguel, 17, and five other boys who come from tough, inner-city areas 
across Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Boys Hope, an international organization founded by a Jesuit priest and funded 
by private donations, admits boys below the age of 14 with their parents' or 
guardians' approval. The organization places them in one of its group homes, 
where they learn discipline, housework, money management and responsibility.  
</P>
<P>
 "They go through stages. At first they think, 'I don't want to be here. Why 
can't I be with my family?' " Tucci said. But, she said, they end up 
befriending their new "siblings" and other children at the private schools Boys 
Hope sends them to. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fine here," said Reuben, a shy, gangly, South-Central Los Angeles native 
who has lived at Boys Hope since January, when his aging grandmother realized 
she could no longer take care of him. 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben, who attends St. John's Episcopal School, said he used to spend his 
afternoons sprawled in front of the television playing Nintendo but now loves 
to study and invent gadgets.  
</P>
<P>
 "In L.A., we got to play all day at school. Here I have homework, but the 
people in the house help me with it." LYNN FRANEY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: ORANGE; HOME FOUND FOR BOY IN TORTURE CASE

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 10-year-old boy who authorities say was tortured and sexually assaulted by 
his aunt was released from a hospital Tuesday and placed with a foster family. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Griffith, deputy director of the Orange County Social Services Agency, 
said the boy's medical needs and publicity surrounding the case discouraged 
many potential foster parents.Griffith said the boy will remain with this 
foster family until authorities determine who will get custody.  
</P>
<P>
 "We have found a home for him with experienced foster parents who have dealt 
with medically involved kids in the past," Griffith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffith said the boy's whereabouts will remain confidential; relatives will 
not be told, but off-site visits may be arranged. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Medina, 31, faces charges of abusing and torturing the boy. The case 
is the county's first in which a defendant has been charged with torture. Her 
husband, Edward Medina, 45, faces charges of failing to stop the abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Cynthia Medina punished the boy for playing with her marijuana 
cigarettes by burning his tongue, whipping him with electrical cords and 
sodomizing him with a souvenir baseball bat, causing severe internal injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy was living with his maternal aunt because his mother could no longer 
care for him. The boy's father and maternal grandmother say they intend to seek 
custody. 
</P>
<P>
 Cynthia Medina admits abusing the boy but says the sexual assault was a "freak 
accident," according to attorney Richard C. Gilbert. Gilbert said he also 
questions whether authorities have exaggerated claims about the boy's injuries. 
He said medical records he received show no signs the boy was treated for burns 
to the tongue. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutor Charles Middleton dismissed such claims, saying the boy's 
injuries were "horrific."RENE LYNCH

CONTRACTORS FINED OVER SUBWAY WORK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A sweeping inspection of Metro Rail subway construction conditions found 131 
alleged health and safety violations that together carry fines of more than 
$250,000, according to a final report Tuesday released by Cal/OSHA. 
</P>
<P>
 In a joint weeklong audit by state and federal occupational safety agencies 
last month, inspectors reported inadequate shoring around trenches and numerous 
electrical hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 They also found numerous cigarette butts in a tunnel that must be continuously 
monitored for methane and hydrogen sulfide -- both highly combustible gases. 
</P>
<P>
 The penalties total $288,470, more than half of that ($164,000) attributed to 
Shea-Kiewit-Kenny, one of the subway project's biggest contractors. 
Tutor-Salibi-Perini, another major Metro Rail contractor, was ordered to pay 
$59,000. The firms can appeal the fines.

<P>
 Concerned that too many employers have fled Los Angeles over the past five 
years, Mayor Richard Riordan has proposed spending more than $1.9 million this 
fiscal year to retain and attract businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor will ask the City Council today to allow him to hire 19 people and a 
marketing firm to launch a massive business retention program. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the council's Budget Committee and Personnel Committee, meeting 
jointly, gave preliminary approval to Riordan's plan, saying it is long 
overdue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this is done right, the whole will be greater than the sum of its parts," 
said Councilman Zev Yaroslavsky, Budget Committee chairman. 
</P>
<P>
 "You will have a mayor who is taking responsibility for economic development 
and business retention in the city and you should have a council that is 
working toward the same goal." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of Riordan's proposal, officials would launch a marketing plan to 
fight off efforts by other states to lure Southern California firms away. Los 
Angeles would also be in the position to offer incentives, including tax breaks 
and loans, to employers. 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said he wants to send a "clear message that the city will be working 
to attract, retain and expand new business here." 
</P>
<P>
 "These kinds of efforts translate to jobs," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of firms have left the area in the last five years, contributing to the 
region's economic slump. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, 140 companies announced plans to move nearly 18,000 jobs out of Los 
Angeles, Orange, Ventura, Riverside and San Bernardino counties, according to 
the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. About 44 firms left in 
1993, taking nearly 7,100 jobs with them. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, eight companies, employing about 2,000 workers, have announced 
plans to leave Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 As the businesses packed their bags, Los Angeles officials found themselves 
ill-equipped to stem the tide. 
</P>
<P>
 Although four people in Riordan's office have been working to keep business in 
the area, their task was too large for such a small staff, said Deputy Mayor 
Mary Leslie.  
</P>
<P>
 "We were in a reactive mode," Leslie said.  
</P>
<P>
 Even smaller cities such as Glendale and Palmdale are doing more to keep 
businesses, city officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have competition from other cities, counties, states and even foreign 
governments," said Michael Gorfain, a city senior administrative analyst who 
has worked with the mayor's office on the plan. "They are not just at our 
doorstep, they are inside our house and they are taking our businesses."  
</P>
<P>
 Members of the business community said they were hopeful that the mayor's plan 
would give the city the edge it needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should have been done years ago," said Carol Schatz, senior vice president 
for the Central City Assn., a group representing Downtown businesses. "We need 
to have a strong focus on these issues in the mayor's office . . . (Riordan) 
deserves kudos." 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's proposal calls for establishing outreach teams to meet with 
executives before they consider leaving. The program would be funded with money 
set aside by the City Council this year to improve relations with business. 
</P>
<P>
 Salaries of the program's staff members would range from $35,000 to $70,000. 
The effort would be a one-year pilot project, subject to reconsideration next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do believe it will more than pay for itself as far as business retention 
and development," Leslie said.

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SANTA ANA; JURY FINDS FOR DEALER IN 2 WOMEN'S FIRING 
</P>

<P>
 Two women who complained about the safety of their employee parking lot were 
not wrongfully fired by an Orange County auto dealership, a Superior Court jury 
found Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury, in a 9-3 vote, sided with Toyota of Garden Grove and found the 
business did nothing wrong in firing Rosemary Holifield and Rae Lynn Wiggins. 
</P>
<P>
 Holifield and Wiggins had sued their former employer, contending they were 
wrongfully fired in 1992 for complaining about the parking lot they were 
required to use, a lot they believed had crime problems. The city-owned parking 
lot was accessible to the dealership only through a tunnel under the Garden 
Grove Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The dealership, however, said it acted properly and the women were fired 
because they broke company policy by not parking their cars in the lot. The 
dealership had contended during the 2 1/2-week trial that it tried several ways 
to address the women's fears, from posting security guards in the lot to 
providing valet parking, shuttle and escort services. 
</P>
<P>
 "What more can you offer?" asked dealership owner Norris J. Bishton Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 He called the verdict a vindication. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been very tough," he said. "We're very happy with the outcome." 
</P>
<P>
 Holifield and Wiggins said they don't regret pursuing the court action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did the right thing," Holifield said. "Someone had to take a stand at one 
point and we chose to." Their lawyer said they would seek a new trial. ANNA

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SEAL BEACH; SCIENTISTS ADDRESS QUAKE TEST FEARS

<P>
 Two U.S. Geological Survey scientists studying earthquake fault lines tried to 
reassure the City Council this week that an explosion they plan for the week of 
Oct. 24 at the Seal Beach Naval Weapons Station poses no risk. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone was convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very skeptical of this," said Councilwoman Gwen Forsythe. "I have this 
feeling inside that you don't mess with Mother Nature." 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing the concerns of some residents, Forsythe questioned whether the 
attempt to map potentially destructive faults underlying Southern California by 
setting off an explosion is worth the risk. 
</P>
<P>
 But geophysicist Gary Fuis told the council there are no risks, despite the 
fact that one of 60 explosions to be set off from Barstow to Seal Beach will 
take place 140 feet below the weapons station. Fuis said weapons station 
officials have assured him the relatively small blast could not explode weapons 
stored at the base. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the least of your worries," Fuis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members also asked if the explosions could trigger earthquakes, but 
Fuis again said there is no cause for alarm. He said similar tests were 
conducted in the San Francisco Bay area in April, 1991, and May, 1993, directly 
on the San Andreas fault with no negative effects. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day in the L.A. basin, there are construction blasts as big or bigger 
than the blast we're going to set off and they don't trigger earthquakes," Fuis 
told council members. "The only event we know of that has triggered an 
earthquake is another earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 After the presentation, Mayor George Brown said he was satisfied there appears 
to be no risk to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel a little uncomfortable about it, but that's their specialty," Brown 
said. "I'm going to have to rely on what they tell us."RUSS LOAR

<P>
 Despite pleas from an overflow audience that overwhelmingly opposed the 
project, the City Council early Tuesday morning unanimously approved 
construction of a large warehouse-distribution center in the Cypress Business 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's vote at 12:30 a.m. culminated a nightlong, raucous meeting 
during which the audience sometimes exploded into boos and catcalls.At one 
point, Mayor Richard Partin threatened to clear the room. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 135 in the audience were homeowners who said their residences 
would be degraded by truck traffic and noise from the warehouse to be built at 
11400 Valley View St. Some accused the council of secrecy in handling of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is so much deception that seems to be happening," resident Kent Woods 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But council members said they followed the law in presenting the project and 
holding a public hearing Monday night and early Tuesday morning. Council 
members also said the large carpet wholesale-distribution center will bring in 
a tax windfall to the city. The developer estimated the warehouse will reap $12 
million in new sales taxes over the next 10 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The 439,650-square-foot structure is to be built for Shaw Industries, a 
Georgia-based carpet maker.  
</P>
<P>
 Don Larimer, regional manager for Shaw Industries, told the council that the 
warehouse would be for wholesale purchases only and that 5 million yards of 
carpet would be stored in the building. He described it as "a very clean 
operation." 
</P>
<P>
 City staff officials also endorsed the warehouse, saying that the 
environmental impact would be minimal. 
</P>
<P>
 "This operation is going to be a benefit to the community," Councilman Walter 
K. Bowman said.BILL BILLITER

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: DANA POINT; DATE OF CITY ELECTIONS SHIFTED TO NOVEMBER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Orange County Board of Supervisors on Tuesday approved a change in the 
date of Dana Point city elections from June to November to coincide with the 
general elections. 
</P>
<P>
 Until now, Dana Point had been the only city in the county to hold City 
Council elections in June, on the day of California's primary elections.But the 
state's recent shift of its presidential primary from June to March caused City 
Atty. Jerry M. Patterson to suggest the council consider changing the local 
election date too. 
</P>
<P>
 The council agreed and unanimously approved the shift a few weeks ago. Because 
the county conducts the elections, the move also had to be approved by county 
supervisors, said City Clerk Sharon L. Waits. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we kept our election in June . . . we would have had a March election and 
then a June election and we would have been going back and forth," Waits said. 
"We wanted to avoid that and this does save some costs." 
</P>
<P>
 By agreeing to move the election, the City Council also added to the lengths 
of their terms, which would have run out in June, 1996. The next city election 
will now be in November, 1996. LEN HALL

PLANE CRASHES ON STREET IN FULLERTON; 2 ON-BOARD INJURED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<P>
 A pilot and his passenger were critically injured Tuesday when their 
single-engine plane heading for Fullerton Airport crash-landed on a busy 
street, narrowly missing several cars. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot Pete Fennell, 30, a California Highway Patrol officer from Orange, had 
radioed the airport tower that he was experiencing trouble and requested 
permission to land moments before he crashed at 2:37 p.m. at the intersection 
of Malvern Avenue and Gilbert Street, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The craft was traveling at about 85 m.p.h. when it touched down, careening 
past a traffic signal that sheared off its right wing, said Fullerton city 
spokeswoman Sylvia Palmer Mudrick. The plane then spun around and slammed into 
a telephone pole as drivers sped to safety, Mudrick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We looked up and saw the plane coming down," said an incredulous Brian 
Fernandez, 16, of Fullerton, who was driving home with his mother when he saw 
the small craft coming toward them. "The cars just flew out of the way. . . . 
It came down right in front of us. I couldn't believe it was happening." 
</P>
<P>
 Several onlookers, including a Fullerton pilot whose car was almost hit by the 
plane, helped the injured men from the aircraft. Fennell and passenger Jeffrey 
Scott Brown, 27, of Mira Loma, who was briefly unconscious after the crash, 
were taken to the emergency room at UCI Medical Center in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital spokeswoman Fran Tardiff said Fennell was undergoing surgery late 
Tuesday night and had suffered two broken legs and a severe laceration on his 
right leg. Brown, whose condition was upgraded, was listed in serious but 
stable condition and transferred to Kaiser Permanente Medical Center in Anaheim 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Police Department Lt. Tony Hernandez said the initial investigation 
indicates Fennell worked for the CHP in South Los Angeles and did not own the 
plane. Hernandez said early indications are that the plane might have run out 
of gas. Several CHP officers visited UCI Medical Center late Tuesday to learn 
word of their friend and co-worker. 
</P>
<P>
 Mudrick said the pilot called the airport tower moments before the crash to 
say he was having problems. The plane is not based at the airport, Mudrick 
said, and initial reports indicate it had taken off from Long Beach Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Some onlookers said the plane made sputtering noises shortly before it 
crashed, and the lack of gasoline near the crash site furthers speculation that 
it might have run out of gas. 
</P>
<P>
 David Son, 11, of Fullerton said he was outside during gym class at Fern Drive 
Elementary School when he saw the plane flying above. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard it making some weird noises. It was going and then it started making 
banging noises. I really didn't think it would crash. I was really surprised." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials credit Fennell with taking care to pilot the crippled aircraft to 
avoid a tragedy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pilot was steering it the whole way down. He flew the airplane under 
control as best he could. Obviously, there was a problem, but he did a good 
job," Fullerton Airport Director Roland Elder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Elder said he did not want to speculate the cause of the accident but said 
that normally if the engine is running, the propeller would be bent. The 
propeller on the crashed plane was not bent, and he noted that the fuselage of 
the Piper craft was intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Elder said the pilot and passenger likely escaped with their lives because of 
the build of the Piper aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those planes are built to crash; they aren't made like cars," he said. "They 
are insulated with steel." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Airport has about 160,000 takeoffs and landings of small airplanes 
annually, Elder said. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA inspector Dawn Grande, who was called to the scene, said the National 
Transportation Safety Board will investigate and determine the cause of the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been more than 22 crashes at or near Fullerton Airport since 1985, 
killing five people and injuring 10, all aboard planes. The most recent crash 
came in July, when a pilot and passenger were critically injured when their 
airplane crashed and caught fire shortly after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
 A spate of crashes in 1992 sparked Buena Park Mayor Rhonda J. McCune to call 
for the airport's closure or at least limit takeoffs and landings over her 
city.

HURRICANE AT BAJA MAKING WAVES SWELL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A hurricane off the southern tip of Baja California is being felt along the 
Orange County coastline, where waves in some areas reached eight feet Tuesday, 
and even bigger waves could wash up today, weather forecasters say. 
</P>
<P>
 The surges delighted surfers at Newport Beach, where the waves doubled in size 
from four feet to eight feet by Tuesday afternoon, Marine Safety Officer Gordon 
Reed said. Lifeguards along the coast said that while the swells are 
increasing, they have not experienced an upturn in rescues or swimmers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess most people are at work," Reed said. "It's also been a little cloudy 
off and on so there isn't much of a beach crowd. The surfers, they're always 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 Weather forecasters say the hurricane could result in wave surges early today, 
but waves are expected to return to normal by this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The waves could get bigger but they are pretty much stamped out by the time 
they get to Southern California," said meteorologist Curtis Brack of 
WeatherData, a service that provides weather information to The Times. "If 
there are any changes, you will likely see it early" today.  
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Steve Seim of the Huntington Beach Marine Safety Department said his 
lifeguards will be on the lookout for any treacherous swimming conditions that 
might be created by the waves, but did not expect any problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's gone from 3 1/2 feet to four- to five-feet waves," Seim said. "We 
haven't gotten much size so far." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from the swells, most Orange County residents will not feel the impact 
of Hurricane Olivia, which developed off the Central American coast but was 
remaining stationary late Tuesday several hundred miles west of the southern 
tip of Baja. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's moving only a little bit and looks like it's decreasing," Brack said. 
"People might see some good large waves coming into the beach and plenty of 
high clouds, but that's about it," he said, adding that he was not expecting 
any weather advisories warning people of dangerous surf conditions.

WILSON SIGNS BILL ON SCHOOL BUS FLASHING LIGHTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson signed a bill Tuesday that was inspired by the death of an 
Orange County boy hit after he got off a school bus, despite criticism from the 
child's parents that the legislation doesn't go far enough. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure authored by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach) goes into 
effect Jan. 1 and will give school districts broad discretion to choose the 
stops where school bus drivers must flash warning lights requiring traffic to 
halt. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing law requires all cars to stop and wait when the warning lights on a 
school bus are activated, but the driver is required to flash the warning 
lights only if students are going to cross the street. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Lanni, who asked Bergeson to carry the bill after his 7-year-old son 
was killed by a pickup truck while getting off a school bus in Laguna Niguel in 
April, dropped his support of the bill several weeks ago after it was weakened 
in committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanni wanted a mandatory requirement that school bus drivers flash warning 
lights to stop traffic whenever children are disembarking. Such language was 
stripped by lawmakers worried that it would cause traffic congestion and 
increase the risk of accidents from drivers hitting the brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The law signed by Wilson allows school districts to decide if the warning 
lights should be used at certain stops. A district would have to get permission 
from the California Highway Patrol and the local traffic engineering department 
before designating such a stop.

 Thousands of rush-hour commuters came to a standstill for six hours Tuesday 
when a 500-gallon drum of cement sealant fell off a freeway construction truck, 
pouring a milky slick across the Riverside Freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 Westbound Riverside Freeway traffic was backed up for six miles to Weir 
Canyon. The spill also closed the northbound transition from Costa Mesa Freeway 
to the Riverside freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 "We treat all these spills seriously until we find out what we have," said CHP 
Officer Alvin Yamaguchi. "Luckily, this isn't toxic, but it's a lot of 
inconvenience." 
</P>
<P>
 Just before 2:30 p.m., a construction worker with Ball, Ball and Boshammer was 
unloading drums of xylene naphtha in the center lane of the freeway, where a 
new toll lane is being built, Yamaguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck's load shifted and one of the drums toppled, its top breaking open. 
Between 350 and 400 gallons of the substance, which gives off toxic fumes if 
burned, spilled under the divider and onto the westbound lanes of the freeway, 
near Kraemer Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost immediately, Yamaguchi said, the 100-by-50-foot slick caused a 
three-car collision, which resulted in minor damage to the cars but no 
injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 For a time, all westbound lanes of the Riverside Freeway were closed between 
the Costa Mesa and Orange freeways, with traffic detoured. 
</P>
<P>
 Before sandbags could be laid, a small amount of the sealant, which is used to 
keep concrete from drying too quickly, spilled into nearby Carbon Canyon Creek, 
causing authorities to notify officials of the state Department of Fish and 
Game. 
</P>
<P>
 While traffic was diverted, Caltrans, along with a hazardous-materials team 
from Los Angeles County and private contractors in protective gear used 
high-pressure hoses to collect the sealant near a tanker truck, which vacuumed 
it. Other workers dug up contaminated soil along the shoulder of the roadway. 
</P>
<P>
 While some of the stalled drivers were resigned to their wait, others fumed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is aggravating," said Hugh Craddock, 49, of Corona, who was missing his 
son's Scout meeting. "I've lost a day out of my life sitting on freeways. It's 
crazy. Think how many man hours are tied up in his mess." 
</P>
<P>
 But Ty Morgan, 36, of Riverside, said, "It's all right. It's a different way 
to spend an evening. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be worse. It could be raining."

ROBIN ABCARIAN: A PLEDGE OF STABILITY FOR CHILDREN IN CHAOS

<P>
 At two long tables in a light, bright conference room of Children's Court in 
Monterey Park, 27 adults are learning how to move one grain of sand at a time. 
</P>
<P>
 They are well dressed, professional looking and represent a spectrum of 
experience: Here is a gemologist, here is an attorney, here is a housewife, 
here is a business executive. Some are retired, some are working full-bore. 
</P>
<P>
 For much of this session, they will shake their heads in amazement, grimace in 
disgust, look incredulous and undoubtedly wonder if they are really up to this. 
</P>
<P>
 At the front of the room is a court-appointed psychologist named Barry Hirsch, 
who is lecturing on attachment theory -- the theory that explains what governs 
the bonds between parent and child and what keeps those bonds strong in spite 
of heinous abuse. He talks about why, for instance, a mother who says she loves 
and wants to retain custody of her year-old child might immobilize the child by 
tying her to the faucets of the kitchen sink and allow her to sit in her own 
feces until she is covered with bugs. And why the court, for instance, might 
allow the mother to keep the child. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our system is based on multiple chances for people," Hirsch is saying. 
"You've got to get used to it. It's amazing what goes on." 
</P>
<P>
 The 27 adults are steeling themselves for what promises to be a tumultuous 
two-year ride. When this training session ends, they will be sworn in as Court 
Appointed Special Advocates -- CASAs for short. They are volunteers and they 
have promised to spend a minimum of five hours a week working with the abused, 
neglected and abandoned children who are wards of Dependency Court. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 46,000 foster children in Los Angeles County, with 1,200 children 
entering the system every month. Not every foster child needs a CASA, nor is 
there any hope that every child could have one. There are but 250 of these 
volunteers. 
</P>
<P>
 A CASA works with one child at a time. The goal is to find a home for each 
child, to give permanence to lives that are no more stable than dry leaves in a 
windstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Doing this work, Hirsch says, "is moving a grain of sand from here to there. 
And there's more sand coming down all the time." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Upstairs, Dependency Court Commissioner Marilyn Kading Martinez is all black 
robes and business as she takes the bench for the afternoon session in her 
courtroom. She has to be; she is expected to process 35 to 40 cases each day. 
This is why, as the afternoon session gets under way, she sometimes sounds more 
like an air traffic controller than a judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Stuffed animals keep the judge company on a nearby rail, and, toward the back 
of the room, a uniformed bailiff busies herself unwrapping teddy bears that 
will be given to the children passing through. 
</P>
<P>
 At the long, curved table below the judge's bench sit all kinds of lawyers -- 
two lawyers for the Department of Social Services, lawyers for parents, lawyers 
for children. This, too, is where the CASAs sit. They have equal standing with 
the others; they, too, are officers of the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Not all Dependency Court judges are enthusiastic about CASAs. But Martinez is 
a big booster. She recognizes the limits of a system in which social workers 
are grievously overburdened and simply cannot devote themselves to finding 
homes for children no one seems to want. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids who get CASAs have needs that are greater than the general 
dependency population," Martinez says. "They may be seeing psychiatrists, 
psychologists, special education teachers, foster parents, relatives. . . . Any 
number of adults have some part to play, and all these roles need to be 
coordinated in a way that best serves the child. CASAs gather together a 
comprehensive picture of what the child needs. They will give me information 
that I may not otherwise have, and my decisions can be well-informed and 
soundly made." 
</P>
<P>
 As one experienced CASA put it: "The court listens to you. They don't B.S. 
because they know you're in the trenches with the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Entering the molasses-paced world of social workers and court-appointed 
attorneys a year ago as a CASA came as a shock to Steve Forstadt. Until he 
retired, Forstadt, 54, owned a women's apparel business and was used to giving 
orders and getting results. 
</P>
<P>
 Forstadt's first case as a CASA involved a 13-year-old boy with severe 
psychological problems who was living in MacLaren Children's Center, which is 
supposed to be a temporary shelter for children. Social workers had been unable 
to find a home for the boy. He had been living at MacLaren for a year, and, 
until Forstadt took the case, it looked as if his final placement would be a 
state mental hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 It took eight months -- and countless trips to prospective group homes with 
the boy -- but Forstadt finally found the child a place. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ruffled a lot of feathers," Forstadt says. "But the end result was there. I 
treat these kids as if they are my own kids, and I try to do for them what I 
would do for my own child. Our job is to give that extra little push for the 
kids that we are representing." 
</P>
<P>
 One little push, one little life made that much better. 
</P>
<P>
 Amazing what can happen when you learn to think small.

SQUARE PEGS?; BEING REJECTED BY PEERS IS NOT ONLY HURTFUL, IT CAN CAUSE 
EMOTIONAL PROBLEMS AND BAD BEHAVIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It's the usual lively birthday bash for a bunch of 5-year-olds at a Chuck E 
Cheese. Children break from their parents' grip upon arrival and race off to 
play together. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for Laurie. She doesn't run to join her classmates. She doesn't want 
her mother to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Pudgy, with pigtails and a sad face, Laurie sits outside the social circle. 
Buddies with no one, she is quiet and clingy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her social skills are light-years behind the other children," her mother 
sighs, acknowledging the obvious difference in her daughter. "I don't know what 
to do about it. Maybe I should hold her back a year in school." 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie has been rejected by her peers. And although she feels intensely 
lonely, she is not alone. Millions of parents have heard the sounds of 
rejection: "No one plays with me." "I don't have any friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Long dismissed as the unfortunate fate of some children, childhood educators 
and psychologists are becoming increasingly convinced that peer rejection 
represents much more than an inevitable social pecking order on school 
playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Recent research suggests that peer rejection is not only hurtful, it can 
hamper a child's development and even lead to long-term emotional or conduct 
disorders if ignored over many years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being rejected in childhood truly is one of life's most harmful experiences," 
says Vivian Gussin Paley, a veteran kindergarten teacher in Chicago and author 
of a book on peer rejection. "A lonely child, a child who feels bad for 
whatever reason, will simply not concentrate on the task at hand. Each year, 
these children come in feeling less confident in making friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to the recent attention given to peer relationships, however, there are 
some effective, new strategies to help almost any child fit in. But the tactics 
are not simple: Parents, teachers, the child and even the child's classmates 
all need to help in putting a stop to the rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all parents hear their children complain about a lack of friends. But 
often, the child is simply upset about a single incident, such as when one of 
Bobby's 20 buddies is mean to him. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint should be taken seriously, however, when it's repeated over 
several months, when a teacher verifies the situation or when parents simply 
observe that their children aren't playing with others by the first grade, says 
Duke University psychologist John D. Coie, a leading authority on peer 
rejection. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes it's a transient thing. But if a child is rejected year after year 
by peers, that is really important," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 It's important to distinguish between children who are loners and children who 
are lonely because they have been rejected, Coie adds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a loner is not a problem. A lot of very competent children do things by 
themselves all through life. The issue is not being able to get along with 
peers," he says. Usually children who don't get along with their peers complain 
about it. 
</P>
<P>
 At any one time, an estimated 10% of children are actively excluded by their 
peers, studies show. But an astute teacher or parent can usually guess which 
children are at risk for peer rejection before it happens. These are the 
children who are obnoxious or bullying, shy and withdrawn or highly 
intelligent. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least half of all rejected kids also show signs of (being disruptive) in 
school. That is the group that has the highest rate of risk and the ones we 
worry about the most," says Coie, co-editor of the book "Peer Rejection in 
Childhood" (Cambridge University Press, 1990). 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes these children are also found to have attention deficit 
hyperactivity disorder, a developmental problem that causes children to be 
disruptive and to fail to pick up on social cues that dictate appropriate 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew May was a gregarious, likable toddler. But when he went to 
kindergarten, his boisterous behavior turned off the other kids. Andrew's 
condition was eventually diagnosed as ADHD, says his mother, Kathryn May of 
Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was excluded. He was not invited to birthday parties. And he was very 
angry. As a result of those things he sought approval by acting out," says May, 
who founded the Long Beach chapter of the national group Children and Adults 
with Attention Deficit Disorders. 
</P>
<P>
 Because peer rejection is so common in children like Andrew, the organization 
CHADD has been active in promoting both individual counseling and classroom 
programs emphasizing good peer relationships, May says. 
</P>
<P>
 "A child's entire perception of themselves is based on their ability to be 
accepted by their peers," she says. "Without peer acceptance these (attention 
deficit) kids won't make it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bullying or aggressive children may not realize that no one likes them. In 
contrast, Coie says, extremely shy children are often aware of their social 
predicament. 
</P>
<P>
 "They probably feel the pain of rejection more," he says. "Often, they are 
picked on or left out; they are the kids who are not as aggressive and do not 
stand up for themselves as well." 
</P>
<P>
 Other studies, however, have found that withdrawn children simply fail to make 
an impression on peers. Rather than being overtly accepted or rejected, they 
are overlooked. 
</P>
<P>
 Another common characteristic among some rejected children is high 
intelligence. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Hall, magnet coordinator at Canterbury School in Pacoima, was concerned 
about one child who was rejected year after year. But scholastic tests 
eventually revealed that he was exceptionally bright. 
</P>
<P>
 "This child was rejected in every class. He was a whiner and a crier and never 
would do what the other kids wanted to do. At recess, all the kids ran the 
other way. Ultimately, he was tested and shown to be highly gifted," Hall says. 
"(Highly intelligent) kids are just not much like other kids. These kids learn 
to entertain themselves because no one else understands them." 
</P>
<P>
 Research has found a few other intriguing clues about what makes a child 
popular or an outcast. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, accepted kids are helpful and considerate of others and follow the 
rules for peer interaction. One study, for example, showed that the biggest 
difference between rejected children and popular children is that popular 
children took the time to find out what was going on in a new group situation 
and attempted to match their behavior to the group. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejected children don't read social cues as well. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Coie believes that the way children handle their own flaws is 
important. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, while overweight children may be teased more, it's the way they 
react to the teasing that can determine how they are ultimately accepted by 
peers. The same is true for children who are inept at games and sports. 
Children who respond with tears and anger will have a hard time. Children who 
respond good-naturedly or with humor do not have the same problem with peers, 
Coie says. 
</P>
<P>
 Having a good sense of humor has greatly helped Fred Nelson, says his mother, 
Lisa Marie Nelson of Agoura. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred is unique: He's hyperactive, has fragile self-esteem and has unusual 
interests. But he doesn't try to hide who he is. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fred likes bats, which other kids might think is weird," Nelson says. "But 
his teacher has made a point of allowing him to show his knowledge about bats 
to the class. So he had a chance to impress the other kids. Things like that 
really help." 
</P>
<P>
 Rejected children don't need the endorsement of their entire class to gain 
confidence and contentment, Nelson notes. Fred is very happy with one close 
friend. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has one good friend who always sticks up for him," she says. "We tell 
Fred: 'Not everyone in the world has to like you.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, it's important to help a rejected child make even small inroads 
as soon as possible, experts say. Even by kindergarten, Paley says, "A 
structure begins to be revealed and will soon be carved in stone." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show one of the biggest problems rejected kids have is their 
reputation. In one study, half the children rejected in the fifth grade 
continued to be rejected by their peers over the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this implies is that even if rejected children change their behavior, 
they may still have a hard time recovering," Coie says. 
</P>
<P>
 But if a rejected child's problems are not resolved in elementary school, he 
or she will become a teen-ager who has no source of support during the 
turbulent adolescent years and is at high risk for dropping out or having major 
social or psychological problems, Coie says. 
</P>
<P>
 These repercussions occur because rejected children have been repeatedly 
denied the chance to learn the social skills necessary to succeed in life. 
</P>
<P>
 Rejected children need not sacrifice their individuality or unique interests 
in order to fit in, experts note. Over time, rejected children often discover 
others with interests or personalities similar to their own. 
</P>
<P>
 "In high school, the curriculum is so diverse that kids often find niches for 
themselves and find kids with similar interests," Coie says. "But the junior 
high school years can be very difficult." 
</P>
<P>
 The goal for parents, counselors, therapists and teachers is to spot rejection 
early and intervene, experts say. When her son was rejected in kindergarten, 
for example, May read books on rejection then began to teach her son basic 
social skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We role-played different situations before we went to a friend's house while 
we were in the car. He hated that, but we did it anyway. And we talked about 
things that annoyed people," she says. "It's critical that the parent take an 
active role." 
</P>
<P>
 It's crucial to remind rejected children of their strong attributes, says John 
Hall, Judy's husband. As one of Los Angeles Unified School District's few 
elementary school counselors, dealing with rejection is a big part of his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talk to them about their positive side, the good pieces about them," he 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 After dealing with the child alone, Hall often sets up small groups of 
children, including the rejected child, to do social skills games, such as 
role-playing. The outcast child often learns skills during these encounters and 
may regain confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Studies show that if rejected children anticipate that their playmates might 
like them, they will behave more appropriately and may indeed become more well 
liked, Coie says. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he adds, before a child is allowed back into the peer group, the peer 
group has to change its bias against the child. 
</P>
<P>
 Because a child's reputation among peers can become established so fast, Paley 
is a leading advocate of pushing children to change their attitudes toward 
others "who, for whatever reason, are not yet part of the system." 
</P>
<P>
 In her book "You Can't Say You Can't Play" (Harvard University Press, 1992), 
Paley tells of the rule she instituted among her kindergartners that does not 
allow a child to be rejected from any aspect of school -- including free play 
time. 
</P>
<P>
 "Children everywhere are allowed to treat each other the way no good teacher 
would ever treat a child," Paley says. "But adults are ambivalent about peer 
rejection because we have been taught that, on this (issue), children must make 
up their own minds." 
</P>
<P>
 With the rule in place, Paley says, the rejected children quickly gain 
confidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of rejected children are eternally grateful to teachers who don't 
allow a child to be shunned, May says. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oftentimes children can be kind and loving to someone with a visible 
disability, but they can be cruel and unkind to a child who has nothing visibly 
wrong but is being a brat," she says. "But if children understand what another 
child is going through, they can be very loving and kind."

HELP YOUR CHILD MAKE FRIENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Parents and teachers should work together to help a rejected child. School 
counselors or private therapists can also be a good source of support. 
</P>
<P>
 According to experts, these are some of the tactics that can help rejected 
children: 
</P>
<P>
 * Listen to a child's complaints about friendships. The complaint should be 
taken seriously and checked out if it persists over the course of a school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Observe your child's play to see if there are obvious problems, such as 
aggressiveness or bossiness. 
</P>
<P>
 * Set up play dates outside school with someone your child chooses. 
</P>
<P>
 * Children can be taught social skills through practice at home or with a 
therapist. Role-playing or using puppets are good ways to help your child 
practice interacting with other children. 
</P>
<P>
 * Encourage your child to find an activity or skill that he or she is good in 
or enjoys, such as a sport or hobby.

<P>
 * Boost the child's self-esteem by pointing out his or her good traits. 
</P>
<P>
 * Consider transferring a child to another school only if the child has 
learned social skills and behaves more acceptably but still cannot shake the 
"reject" reputation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Don't reveal your anxieties or frustrations about your child's social 
skills. Be honest about what your child does or needs to learn, but be loving 
and supportive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Teachers should keep parents informed of how the child is socializing at 
school. 
</P>
<P>
 * Teachers should discourage the practice of allowing a child to be excluded 
from a school activity, including during free time or playground time. 
</P>
<P>
 * Read books with your child on making friends. Some good ones include:

THE FAMILY FILE: '90S FAMILY; PARENTS DON'T MAKE THE GRADE IN INVOLVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nearly half of all U.S. high school students have parents who don't attend PTA 
meetings or back-to-school nights, don't go to class plays or science fairs or 
varsity football games, and don't volunteer at the school or serve on school 
committees. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-fourths of U.S. parents expect their children to graduate from college, 
and the same proportion are at least moderately involved in school activities 
when their children are in elementary school. 
</P>
<P>
 But a new study released by Child Trends Inc., a private, nonprofit research 
organization in Washington, D.C., shows that parents' school involvement drops 
off sharply when students reach middle school or junior high -- and declines 
still further in high school. Yet, students whose parents remain involved in 
school-related activities tend to do better in school and are more active in 
extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "Running in Place: How American Families Are Faring in a Changing Economy and 
an Individualistic Society" also revealed that working mothers are just as 
active in their children's schools as full-time homemakers. Written by 
psychologist Nicholas Zill and demographer Christine Windquist Nord, the report 
was funded by grants from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Nord 
Family Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to documenting the withdrawal of parental involvement in 
post-elementary school activities, "Running in Place" provides a statistical 
portrait of the time-versus-money quandary that plagues so many parents. 
Stagnant wages, eroding job benefits, a significant increase in unmarried 
childbearing and a lack of support by non-residential parents are making it 
more and more difficult for families to provide for their own basic needs. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to economic pressures, this national survey found, parents are 
working more outside the home. But they have little to show for their increased 
employment; they are working harder, Zill and Nord report, just to remain in 
the same place. Volunteers Sought to Staff Suicide Hot Line 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Center, a division of Family Services of 
Los Angeles, needs volunteers to handle some of the more than 14,000 calls that 
come in annually to the 24-hour crisis line. Director Jay Nagdimon says there 
are 60 volunteers available to assist these callers, but a minimum of 110 to 
115 volunteers is needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Volunteers over 28 are needed for six-hour shifts, particularly during 
early-morning and daytime hours. A 32-hour comprehensive training program is 
held quarterly. 
</P>
<P>
 Training includes interpersonal skills and how to communicate effectively with 
people in distress. No experience is necessary. Trained staff members are 
available to volunteers during all shifts, along with debriefing support in 
crisis calls. 
</P>
<P>
 For more information, call Nagdimon at (213) 381-3626. How to Work With 
Teachers -- and the System 
</P>
<P>
 Psychologist Judi Craig offers a primer for parental involvement in the form 
of her new book, "What Happened at School Today?" (William Morrow & Co., 1994). 
</P>
<P>
 Among other issues, the book addresses "How to Be Your Child's Best Advocate," 
making suggestions on how to establish rapport with teachers, how to prepare 
for school conferences and how best to work within school systems.

REAL LIFE: '90S FAMILY; THE EFFECTS OF MOVIES DIFFER FROM KID TO KID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LYNN SMITH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some researchers say the debate is over -- that children are undeniably harmed 
by media violence. Others maintain the jury is still out. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost every parent already knows that it's a lot more complex than yes, 
they're hurt, or no, it's just a movie. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, one mother said her 8-year-old would shrug off blood-splattered 
scenes in the R-rated "Die Hard" but is too frightened to see the PG-rated 
"Ghostbusters" -- as is her 13-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 Some 10-year-olds were terrified by the rapacious dinosaurs in "Jurassic 
Park," while others were fascinated by the special effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents thought "Andre" would be safe -- until their 3-year-olds started 
screaming during a scary storm scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts who fault the Motion Picture Assn. of America's film rating system for 
being of little use say that in order for parents to better judge which movies 
might be harmful, they need much more information than PG, PG-13 and R. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, UC Santa Barbara researcher Barbara Wilson said that not only do 
individual children vary greatly -- regardless of age -- in their abilities to 
evaluate what they're seeing, but children between 8 and 12 differ markedly 
from 3- to 7-year-olds in how they respond to media portrayals. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger children have more trouble separating reality from fantasy and depend 
more on surface appearances. Some were frightened by the way the alien E.T. 
looked, despite his kind nature. They perceive Ninja Turtles to be human as 
long as they act human. 
</P>
<P>
 Older children are better at drawing conclusions, forming opinions and 
recognizing consequences. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, some depictions are actually more problematic for older than for 
younger children, she said. Older children, for instance, were more upset by 
"The Day After," a movie about nuclear holocaust, than younger children who 
didn't understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 "One mother said 'Charlotte's Web' upset her (preschool) child a lot more," 
Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Preteen viewers are more interested in motives and role models and are more 
inclined to imitate behaviors portrayed by actors around their age. Young 
children are more likely to be influenced by child actors such as Macaulay 
Culkin. 
</P>
<P>
 In both groups, movies that feature young perpetrators cause more problems 
than those with violent adults, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, she said, context is crucial and often more significant than volume 
or explicitness. While violence portrayed in "Schindler's List," for example, 
was presented as despicable, that shown in hero-action movies such as "Rambo: 
First Blood" is often glorified. 
</P>
<P>
 Portrayals in which violent characters benefit from their actions or are not 
punished for antisocial acts can encourage aggressive attitudes and copycat 
behavior, Wilson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Younger children are particularly susceptible to violence that appears to be 
justified -- such as acts committed by the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. 
</P>
<P>
 If the punishment is delayed until the end of the movie, younger children are 
more likely to see the violence as acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson said it is thought that scenes of horror, street language and erotic 
sex can be analyzed similarly, although ethics have prevented researchers from 
using control groups to study the effects of sexual portrayals on children. 
</P>
<P>
 Reformers such as Wilson are calling for a new ratings system, based on child 
development and devised by an independent group of parents, researchers and 
teachers. This summer, the American Medical Assn. also called for a new rating 
system based on context and broken down for ages 3-7, 8-12 and 13-17. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, said Wilson: "Many studies suggest one of the most important things 
a parent can do to mediate these effects is to watch with children, to help 
them interpret images and make sense of what they're seeing."

'90S FAMILY; ERRAND EDUCATION; ASK THE RIGHT QUESTIONS AND YOU TURN A SIMPLE

ONLY WILL IT KEEP THE KIDS OCCUPIED, BUT IT WILL HELP THEM IN SCHOOL.

 As Kim Eaves runs errands in her Lake Forest neighborhood, she often takes her 
daughter, Monet, 4. Eaves said that at the market, they discuss what types of 
baby food to buy for 1-year-old Zeb ulun and how to spell items they see. They 
sing the alphabet song while strolling the aisles and talk about carrots and 
spinach as they hit the produce section. Monet delights in handing the clerk 
the paper bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Eaves, 31: "I want her to learn, but I also want to keep her occupied." 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say that even with the occasional tantrums and turmoil that can 
accompany a young child's trip in and out of stores, parents are smart to 
involve little ones in some errands. By introducing or reinforcing math and 
reading skills in commonplace settings, they add, parents can make school 
lessons seem more relevant to a child and increase their chances of success. 
</P>
<P>
 "It stresses that learning isn't just listening to the teacher. There are 
opportunities in everyday life," said Barbara Willer, spokeswoman for the 
National Assn. for the Education of Young Children, a Washington, D.C.-based 
nonprofit organization specializing in the education of children up to age 8. 
</P>
<P>
 And, when parents share in the excitement and wonder of the learning 
discovery, this time with their kids can even be fun, said Marcy Cook, a math 
consultant who has 30 years experience in education, teaching and consulting. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some suggestions from Cook and other experts for making errands a 
learning experience. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the road: A parent need not wait to get to the destination; learning can 
start en route. 
</P>
<P>
 A child can try to remember how to get there. Prompting questions like "Which 
way do we turn next?" or "What do we pass first: the post office or the 
gardening store?" or "Where do we get off the bus?" help jog a child's memory 
and sequencing skills. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the mall: The child needs something to look for or figure out. 
</P>
<P>
 "A mall to a child is a large play area," said Studio City therapist Sharon 
Sackin, who conducts parenting workshops. "A store is a wonderland of places to 
hide. The child thinks: 'How much fun can I have?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sackin said the youngster can be given a problem such as: "We have to stop at 
the shoe store, bookstore, and toy store in the mall. Help me figure out the 
path so that we end up at the pet shop." This helps create spatial abilities 
needed for geometry and problem-solving skills needed for algebra, experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 "They often know the lay of the land more than you realize," Willer said. 
Allowing them to show off their knowledge will make them feel good about the 
skills they have, increasing their self-esteem. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the market: This frequent stop for parents can be approached as a game. 
Children who learn through play find learning exciting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Make it like a scavenger hunt," Cook suggested. 
</P>
<P>
 Children can help find items on the shopping list by using coupons. Before the 
trip, the child may be able to help by clipping coupons, Sackin said. Then, 
going up and down the store aisles, the youngster delights in using the 
pictures on the coupons to find the products. Younger children would be given 
one coupon at the appropriate aisle; those with formal reading skills can be 
given several coupons from which to decide, Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 First- or second-graders can begin to learn the value of a dollar. They can be 
asked to see how many different things they can find to buy with $1. As they 
scan the aisles for the price label, they are learning relative money values. 
Parents can't help but get pulled into the excitement of helping light bulbs go 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents, Cook said, may opt to give the child a dollar and allow him to 
make a purchase and receive the change. Many children love receiving change 
because trading a paper bill for an item and five coins feels like they've made 
money on the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 Cook suggested posing the question: "How could you have gotten the change 
differently?" "A good start for a good question begins with 'How many different 
ways or things . . ,' " Cook said. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting and adding skills can also be reinforced in the market, Cook said. 
Preschoolers learn that one, two, three are more than words to learn in order; 
they are the basis of a concept. Kindergartners can keep a tally of the number 
of items put into the cart, Cook added. Four lines and a slash equals five 
items. On the way home, the child counts by fives to figure the total, giving 
the child a jump on learning multiplication tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Once at home, the parent can show the youngster how to use graph paper to make 
a bar graph showing the number of items purchased. The child colors a column, 
with each square representing five items. A different color can be used for 
each trip and the height of the colored bars compared. Making bar graphs 
prepares a child to plot points on a graph in geometry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coloring is a fun thing," Cook said. "Why not make it meaningful?" 
</P>
<P>
 Elementary school-age children can improve their accuracy with a calculator by 
keeping a running total. On the way home, they can double-check the tape total. 
The excitement, Cook said, is in trying the catch an error made by the store 
cash register. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the post office: This is another perfect spot for a parent to engage a 
child and reduce having to reprimand junior for ducking in and out of the 
roped-off lines. Cook suggested posing this problem: "I have $5. How many 
29-cent stamps can I buy? How much change would I get?" Substitute other dollar 
amounts to keep the child thinking. Allowing a youngster to do the division 
computations with a calculator lets him or her to practice two skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a child as young as 4-year-old Monet Eaves gets a lesson on pounds and 
ounces at the post office. She loves to place envelopes on the electronic scale 
and push the buttons to enter the ZIP code. After the scale computes the 
postage, she and Mom discuss what happens after a letter is mailed. 
</P>
<P>
 When parents run an errand to the post office or cleaners, they can also ask 
the child to remember as many things as he can, Sackin said. When they get 
home, the child can draw a picture or write a narrative. Memory and language 
skills are tied into reading success. A parent may opt to reward the sibling 
who remembers the most. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are raising the child's desire to be more aware," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Children can even learn on quick trips to the gas station. Besides 
conversations about how the car needs gas to run, parents can ask children to 
estimate how many gallons it takes to fill the car, Cook said. Youngsters can 
take into account the level of the fuel gauge. Their first guesses will be so 
way off they'll be entertaining. Estimation is another match skill, said Cook, 
adding that "the more you know, the more frames of reference you have." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At work: A brief trip to a parent's office also provides opportunities for 
growth. Even by just going along to pick up or drop off something, the child 
learns about career options, Willer said. Young children will use the career 
ideas in their pretend play while older children can start to plan their 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Debbie Gilmore of Cudahy took her daughter Kimberly, 15, by her office at the 
Southern California Indian Center in Commerce. Gilmore, who once received 
employment training at the center, went to drop off her time sheet and look 
over a job skills test. 
</P>
<P>
 An unplanned lesson ensued: "I told (my daughter) 'when you look for a job, 
you'll take a similar test.' She didn't know what went into (job hunting), how 
to fill out an application or write a resume. She learned something new," 
Gilmore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Quality time, like learning, happens as parents go about their daily lives, 
even in such seemingly mundane tasks as errands, Willer said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be a very special time. It helps to create memories that are important 
for you and your children."

LOCAL HERO: A SINGLE MOM WITH LOTS OF SPUNK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIBBY SLATE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A friend of Susan Speir's once gave her a card that read: "If I'm not 
accepting what I can't change, I'm probably out changing what I can't accept." 
</P>
<P>
 Speir went out to create change in 1982. She was personnel director for a 
Compton furniture company and a single mother trying to collect child support 
from her ex-husband for their two daughters, then 10 and 11. Despite a court 
order and help from her local child-support office, her efforts had proved 
fruitless. 
</P>
<P>
 After attending conferences and reading government reports on the issue to see 
if there was something more she could do, Speir realized that there were many 
other mothers in her position. And thus was born SPUNK (Single Parents United 
'N' Kids), an organization to help parents collect child support. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started SPUNK because I thought, 'If I can't get mine, at least I'll help 
other people get theirs,' " recalls Speir, 45. "I'm originally from Minnesota, 
and we were taught to take care of ourselves and other people too, not to sit 
there and feel sorry for yourself if there was adversity." 
</P>
<P>
 Having first set up shop in her Long Beach home, since 1991 she has operated 
from a small office at the Houghton Park Community Center in North Long Beach. 
The program now fields about 1,200 calls a month. 
</P>
<P>
 It has expanded its initial information and referral services to include 
obtaining court orders, doing the paperwork to establish paternity if the 
parents never married, handling simple divorce cases, holding twice-monthly 
divorce clinics, and publishing pamphlets on those and other subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Speir completes about 130 legal actions a month for low-income clients in the 
cities assigned to the Long Beach, Compton and Torrance court districts. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we try to stress to the women is not to deal with this emotionally," 
Speir says. "This is a business issue, not an emotional one. They have to focus 
on what's in the best interest of the children -- many times they're so focused 
on the father and his reaction that they don't even think of the children." 
</P>
<P>
 About 10% of the requests that SPUNK receives come from men who need help 
dealing with delinquent mothers. "We're about getting the children their money. 
We don't care if it's the mom or dad who calls," Speir says. 
</P>
<P>
 There was a happy ending for Speir herself. Even though she had given up hope 
of obtaining the money owed her daughters, in 1983 she was in court helping a 
SPUNK client when she talked to the Los Angeles deputy district attorney about 
her own case. Through his efforts, her ex-husband was arrested in Texas and 
extradited to California. Shortly thereafter, Speir received a check for 
$13,761, thought to be the largest back support payment collected to that time. 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day, I believe I wouldn't have gotten a dime if I hadn't started 
SPUNK," she says. "And that's not why I did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We help people on a daily basis," Speir says. "We encourage both parties to 
not be afraid of the court system. You can't focus on the negative -- you have 
to think of the positive, how many people's lives you've changed. It makes me 
feel so good." 
</P>
<P>

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; RACE CAR, TRUCK AND TRAILER STOLEN 
</P>

<P>
 A $40,000 race car was stolen from in front of the owner's house Tuesday 
morning, Los Angeles police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Also taken were a custom-built trailer and a white F-150 Ford truck. 
</P>
<P>
 The thieves were fortunate to find the race car still parked on the trailer 
and attached to the truck, Police Sgt. Dan Maestro said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12:30 a.m. Tuesday, the car's owner, Nicholas Johanides, parked the 
truck and adjoining trailer and race car outside his house in the 5800 block of 
Oakdale Avenue, police said. Johanides discovered the car, trailer and truck 
missing about 9:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a helicopter search, officers so far have been unable to find the 
yellow and red stock car with a number "17" painted on the door.  
</P>
<P>
 Police suspect that the colors will change quickly. "The thieves will probably 
strip it down and make their own race car out of it," Maestro said. 
</P>
<P>
 The truck and trailer are estimated to be worth $55,000, he said. JEANNETTE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; LAKE RESIDENTS COMPLAIN GEESE ARE NUISANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Wild geese may live a carefree existence in the sheltered environs of Lake 
Calabasas, but their presence is no picnic for area residents, who say the 
birds have begun to overpopulate and create a nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation has fueled controversy between animal-rights activists who want 
to protect the geese and area residents who fear that they are ruining their 
lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a lot of emotion tied to this," said Bruce Richards, director of the 
Agoura Animal Shelter. "There is a public relations issue here that has to be 
handled just right -- with a feather touch, if you will excuse the pun." 
</P>
<P>
 The population of geese has been soaring over the last few years to the point 
where the lake can no longer accommodate them all, most involved in the issue 
agree. Some of the geese have attacked people, although there apparently have 
been no injuries, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the normal stresses that geese and birds are confronted with in the wild 
don't exist at this lake," Richards said. "They are very protected. They don't 
have to deal with coyotes over there like they do in the open spaces." 
</P>
<P>
 The lake is in jeopardy as a result of the overpopulation, said Don Diamond, 
chairman of Calabasas Lake Maintenance Committee, which represents about 225 
homes around the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 "They leave droppings on the sidewalk and in the lake and reduce the water 
quality and increase algae," said Diamond, who has been meeting with Richards 
and others in an attempt to find a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 The geese at the lake are snow geese. One variety is white with black wing 
tips; the other has a dark body with a white head and neck.  
</P>
<P>
 Shelter officials want to help out with the problem, Richards said, but the 
facility is not equipped to care for geese. 
</P>
<P>
 "They thought they could bring 30 or 40 geese over here," he said. "We told 
them this is an animal shelter for cats and dogs -- not geese." 
</P>
<P>
 The shelter took in four geese and found homes for them, but would be 
hard-pressed to find homes for more, he said, because there is no demand for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're being very careful," he said. "We don't want them to end up on 
somebody's dinner table." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, there is no reason to be frightened of geese, said Calabasas 
Mayor Karyn Foley, who has been working to find a solution to the problem. 
Foley, Richards, Diamond and others will hold a meeting to discuss a solution 
at 7:30 p.m. Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 People should stand their ground when confronted by the geese, Foley said. 
"You can usually stare them down." 
</P>
<P>
 And nobody has ever been hurt in a run-in with the birds, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have been known to nibble on tushes," she said. "But they don't have 
teeth, and it's just a little pinch." FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; REDEVELOPMENT PLAN GETS MIXED RECEPTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to set up an emergency redevelopment zone in quake-ravaged North 
Hills generated lukewarm reaction Tuesday from community leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 But members of the North Hills Community Coordinating Council, who discussed 
the proposal with Los Angeles Community Redevelopment Agency Commissioner Bobbi 
Fiedler, said they would not rule out the option. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think that the CRA is necessarily the answer," said council president 
Harry Coleman, who leads the non-governmental advisory panel. "But we want to 
explore every avenue." 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the Community Redevelopment Agency suggested that North 
Hills and five other areas be considered as emergency redevelopment zones to 
help repair earthquake damage. The CRA is expected to make its final 
recommendation to the City Council in November. Under state law, such emergency 
zones would be created without the time-consuming expense of environmental 
studies traditionally required. Property tax generated from new construction 
sites within the zone would pay for improvements such as new parks, streets and 
loans to quake victims. 
</P>
<P>
 But the concept is controversial because, as Fiedler pointed out, control over 
the zone would be out of the hands of the public and in the hands of CRA 
officials, who have the ability to seize blighted property under the power of 
eminent domain. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're bringing something in that has tremendous power," Fiedler said. "We're 
allocating a lot of money to that agency without the public being able to get 
involved. Be sure to stay involved in that process." 
</P>
<P>
 Other concerns aired Tuesday included a CRA policy that 20% of agency funds 
within a zone be used to develop low-income housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Coleman pointed out that the area already has 19,000 units crammed into a 
six-square-block area. Forty percent of those units are vacant, and many are 
low-income housing, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have a substantial amount of low-income housing in the area," 
Coleman said. "That is part of our problem." 
</P>
<P>
 But Fiedler did see ways that North Hills could benefit from such a zone, such 
as using CRA funds to restore buildings to enhance outreach efforts in the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 After the meeting, however, Fiedler said privately that she does not recommend 
a CRA zone for the North Hills area. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Coleman also conceded that he is leaning against the proposal, he 
said it will be discussed at a meeting of the group's housing subcommittee in 
two weeks. JEFF SCHNAUFER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; OFFICIALS TO STUDY PLANS FOR SUBDIVISION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Calabasas City Council and Planning Commission will hold a joint session 
tonight to study revised plans for a subdivision by a developer who once 
successfully blocked Calabasas' effort to incorporate. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing is at 7:30 p.m. at City Hall. City officials said the project, 
called Calabasas Oaks, could go before the Planning Commission by the end of 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a public hearing," said Anna-Lisa Hernandez, the city's associate 
planner, who is handling the project. "It's a study session. It's strictly to 
teach." 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed 1,200-plus-acre project includes 550 homes at the end of Parkway 
Calabasas. There would also be a church site and 200,000 square feet of retail 
space off Las Virgenes Road. As part of the proposal, the developer has deeded 
640 acres to the Santa Monica Mountains Conservancy to be preserved as open 
space. 
</P>
<P>
 The applicant, Baldwin Cos.-Village Properties, wants to redesign the site 
plan to reduce the amount of grading by 400,000 cubic yards of soil, according 
to Hernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County approved an entitlement to grade about 15 million cubic 
yards before Calabasas became a city in 1991. Also, the applicant, who obtained 
permission to remove 1,800 oak trees, Hernandez said, now proposes removing 
1,400. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from Baldwin Properties could not be reached for comment Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer, Jim Baldwin, originally wanted to build 1,487 homes, but ran 
into fierce opposition from area residents, who were represented by the 
Calabasas Park Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Baldwin, saying he does not want to be subject to the whims of a future City 
Council and laws that had not yet been determined, sought in 1988 to prevent 
his project from being included in the area of the proposed city. His sister -- 
saying she was an "interested citizen" looking to safeguard county funds -- 
sued to block county funding of brush-fire protection within the limits of the 
proposed city. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently fearing that the proposed city could not afford to pay a $675,800 
fire protection fee to the county, the Los Angeles County Local Agency 
Formation Commission eventually rejected the application for cityhood. Baldwin 
agreed to support a renewed drive for cityhood in 1990 in exchange for the 
homeowners association's promise not to oppose the project if it were scaled 
down to 550 homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Ronka, a former member of the association's board of directors, said that, 
while some hard feelings may remain, the development is "a done deal" as far as 
the association is concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a development agreement that was agreed to several years ago," said 
Ronka, who was then a member of the Baldwin Committee, which was organized to 
fight the development. "It was a hard fight, but we won some of the most 
important battles." FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CHATSWORTH; CITY APPROVES PACT FOR BANK PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council approved a development agreement Tuesday to 
ensure that Great Western Bank can complete the development of its headquarters 
in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement guarantees that the bank can finish building the mixed-use 
project regardless of any changes the city may make in neighborhood zoning laws 
over the next 10 years or so, according to city officials and bank 
representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 About five years ago, Great Western began development of 790,000 square feet 
of office space, a 90,000-square-foot employee service center, a child-care 
center for 300 children and parking space for the entire complex on Prairie 
Street near Oakdale Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank has yet to build three six-story office buildings and garages for 
most of its parking, said Jerry Welch, Great Western's manager for corporate 
services. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank has not set a date for completing the project. Consequently, the bank 
asked the city to approve the development agreement to guarantee that the 
remainder of the complex can be built regardless of future changes in the 
area's zoning codes, Welch said. HUGO MARTIN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: PACOIMA; UCLA HELPS REBUILD ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Spanish-style breezeways and high-ceilinged corridors of Pacoima 
Elementary School have rung with the sounds of laughing, shouting students for 
79 years.  
</P>
<P>
 But the aging building, severely battered by the January earthquake, badly 
needs renovating and improvements beyond state-mandated handicap-access, 
flooring and safety lighting work currently under way. 
</P>
<P>
 So, since June, five members of a special design team have worked more than 
150 hours each creating a series of innovative exterior and interior redesigns 
and renovation concepts for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 The team could have charged $20,000 for the work. But because the project is 
part of an advanced class for fourth-year students at the UCLA Extension 
Interior and Environmental Design Program, they will settle for a few school 
credits. 
</P>
<P>
 The fruit of the UCLA students' efforts will be on display at the school 
between 2 and 4 p.m. Thursday. Students will discuss their ideas, models, 
sketches and blueprints, which elementary school Principal Lawrence Gonzales 
plans to use in pitches to local businesses for funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we asked them to do is to come up with ideas to enhance the learning 
environment," Gonzales said. "We wanted to put the design students in a 
situation where they have a chance to see their work actually create 
improvements. And it allows us to go to potential donors and say, 'Here's what 
we'd like to do.' We can be specific, and we save a lot of money on the design 
fees." 
</P>
<P>
 The program, a new joint venture between the Los Angeles Unified School 
District and the UCLA Extension design program, was conceived by architect 
Jeffrey Daniels, head of the UCLA program.  
</P>
<P>
 His students met with Pacoima Elementary School students, teachers and 
parents, collected ideas and set to work. They came up with new plans for even 
better handicap access, a new concept for an arbor/sitting area in front of the 
school and painstakingly pieced together cardboard models and exhibits of 
planned improvements for classrooms, offices and the library. 
</P>
<P>
 Other LAUSD schools slated to participate in the program are a Pico-Union area 
elementary school and a Cerritos infant care center for teen-age mothers still 
in high school. TIM MAY

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : TEACHERS FACE MOVES DUE TO ENROLLMENT FALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Joan Bergenty, a third- and fourth-grade teacher for eight years at Andasol 
Avenue Elementary School, is on the transfer list. 
</P>
<P>
 And so are a lot of other teachers, if student enrollment at several San 
Fernando Valley schools does not increase by Oct. 14. That is the date the Los 
Angeles Unified School District will notify teachers at schools with declining 
enrollment of their transfers to more crowded schools in the inner city. 
</P>
<P>
 As at Andasol, enrollment at many Valley schools, especially those in 
earthquake-ravaged areas, is down substantially -- a result of 14,000 to 17,000 
apartment units having been damaged or destroyed in the quake. Many families 
have moved temporarily away from their neighborhoods and have not returned, 
school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools receive money for each student they enroll; if there are not enough 
students, teachers are transferred to schools that have too many students, or 
they are placed in a substitute teaching pool, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of students in West Valley schools are arguing that although 
enrollment may be low now, as apartments are repaired and reopened, the 
families will move back and enroll their children at schools that will then be 
understaffed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are coming back," Bergenty said. "And my job is on the line." 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of Andasol's PTA, Beverly Cordova, set up a table in front of 
the elementary school Tuesday afternoon to alert fellow parents to the possible 
loss of teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids have gone through enough already," Cordova said, explaining that 
since the January quake, children have been shuffled around from house to house 
and have experienced a general sense of instability. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordova, the mother of three Andasol students, said that if the teachers 
leave, the elementary school students will be displaced once again as they are 
dispersed to different classes that have already been in session for a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Cordova, who also manages an apartment complex undergoing quake repairs, said 
she surveyed 17 other area apartment buildings, accounting for more than 1,000 
living units, and found that all of them are scheduled to reopen before the end 
of this school year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were seven children at my place alone," Cordova said. She added that 
larger buildings had as many as 100 children of elementary school age living in 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the school board voted to set aside $1 million that may go toward 
paying the salaries of teachers who would otherwise be transferred out. 
</P>
<P>
 School district spokesman Bill Rivera said the district may also apply for 
federal disaster aid funds to cover teachers' salaries, if schools can prove 
that there is a direct link between earthquake displacement and low enrollment. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles district has already received $100 million from the Federal 
Emergency Management Agency for quake-related projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, parent activists like Cordova are gathering data about which 
students did not return, finding out if they lived in the damaged apartments 
and figuring out if they will come back. 
</P>
<P>
 Board members will vote on whether the teachers will be kept at schools after 
the enrollment figures are compiled on Oct. 14, Rivera said. However, Julie 
Korenstein, who represents many of the affected schools, is trying to delay the 
vote so that schools have more time to determine whether more students come 
back. MAKI BECKER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS : CSUN HAS SMALLEST FALL CLASS IN 24 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN CHANDLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials at Cal State Northridge said Tuesday that the earthquake-stricken 
campus' official enrollment this fall declined to 24,310 students, the lowest 
level for a fall semester in 24 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus' head count reflects a loss of 2,972 students from the 27,282 tally 
a year ago, a drop of 10.9%.The last time the campus had a lower fall semester 
student population was in the fall of 1970, when official enrollment was 
tallied at 22,721, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest CSUN enrollment figures also show the campus lost 503 students 
alone from last spring's 24,813 student population. That also is highly 
unusual, because campus enrollments in the fall almost always are larger than 
in the spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Campus officials have been reluctant to attribute the losses to students 
abandoning the campus in the wake of the heavy damage it suffered in the 
magnitude 6.8 Northridge earthquake in January. But the latest figures back up 
student reports of their classmates leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 CSUN's enrollment, which hit a peak of 31,531 in fall, 1988, has been 
declining in recent years along with the entire Cal State system -- losses 
officials have attributed to the recession and several years of fee increases. 
</P>
<P>
 However, CSUN had been losing students more rapidly, and the earthquake has 
only accelerated that trend. In contrast, the 20-campus Cal State system, 
including CSUN, projects its total enrollment this fall will remain at about 
the 326,000-student level of a year ago. JOHN CHANDLER

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; 3 ROBBERY SUSPECTS ARRESTED AFTER CHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Three men suspected in a string of catering truck robberies in Van Nuys were 
arrested Tuesday after a chase in which one of the men fired several rounds at 
an officer, striking the windshield of his patrol car, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 No injuries were reported in the incident, which began about 11:15 a.m. in the 
15700 block of Strathern Street and ended about 3:20 p.m. when a police dog 
found the last suspect hiding under a house. 
</P>
<P>
 "There have been a series of six catering truck robberies in the Van Nuys area 
since last month," Los Angeles Police Detective Mel Arnold said. "We feel 
confident that we have the persons responsible for this." 
</P>
<P>
 Arrested were William Christopher Curl, 18, and Gerard Lemar Benford, 21, both 
of Los Angeles, and Marlin Gums, 20, of Van Nuys. They were charged with 
attempted murder of a police officer and were being held in lieu of $500,000 
bail, Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began when Police Detective Gregory Demirjian witnessed the 
robbery of a catering truck on Strathern, Arnold said. One of the men took 
about $600 from the truck driver and escaped on foot to a getaway car waiting 
around the corner. 
</P>
<P>
 Demirjian pursued the speeding suspects, calling for assistance along the way. 
When the men reached the tunnel at Stagg Street beneath the San Diego Freeway, 
they abandoned their car and one of them fired several rounds at Demirjian's 
car, hitting the windshield, Arnold said. 
</P>
<P>
 Demirjian and a responding patrol officer captured two of the suspects on 
foot. The third was caught after police cordoned off an area surrounding Orion 
Avenue and Stagg Street on the east side of the San Diego Freeway. JEFF

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: STUDIO CITY; BASKETBALL HOOPS STAY DOWN AT CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Basketball players who were crushed when the city closed the basketball court 
at the Studio City Recreation Center have insisted they can police themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 At a community meeting last week attended by players, neighbors and a police 
officer, park officials said that the basketball backboards would remain 
hoop-less for an indefinite period, but left the door open for a compromise by 
which they could be reinstated. 
</P>
<P>
 Neighbors were shocked when, three weeks ago, one man pistol-whipped a 
basketball player near the court, causing the gun to fire. The bullet did not 
hit anyone at the park, which is used by many children. Park officials removed 
the hoops one week later. 
</P>
<P>
 At last week's meeting, some people suggested keeping the hoops off for six 
months to a year, but park administrators have not said when, or if, the hoops 
will come back. 
</P>

 Park director Jon Klay said he will meet with basketball players to see if 
they can come up with measures to alleviate neighbors' concerns about noise, 
foul language, fistfights and security. If successful, the talks could lead to 
the replacement of the hoops.  
</P>
<P>
 Some of the ideas tossed around at the meeting included restricting the 
court's hours of operation, requiring players to sign a code of conduct and 
posting rules at the court. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The basketball players') language was foul -- it was a bad influence for the 
children," said Faye Buckner, who has an 8-year-old son who frequents the park. 
"We would just as soon (the hoops) stay down if it can't be in a supervised or 
monitored situation." KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE RESPONSE TEAM WILL TARGET HATE CRIMES; COUNCIL: EFFORT WILL PROMOTE 
CONDEMNATION OF SUCH ACTS, OFFER COUNSELING TO VICTIMS AND HELP WITH PROPERTY 
REPAIRS. 
</P>

<P>
 The Glendale City Council, reacting to the painting of swastikas on a 
synagogue, Tuesday created a city response team for hate crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 The team -- made up of representatives from city government, various ethnic 
groups, religious leaders and members of Glendale business and educational 
organizations -- will promote public condemnation of hate crimes, offer 
counseling to victims and help with graffiti cleanup and property repairs. 
</P>
<P>
 At a special meeting Tuesday afternoon, the council unanimously passed a 
resolution establishing the team, suggested by the Blue Ribbon Task Force on 
Community Relations set up four months ago by Mayor Eileen Givens. 
</P>
<P>
 With emotions running high in the public discussion session before the 
council's vote, supporters of the motion stressed the need to change the city's 
decades-old image of racial antagonism. Opponents called for African American 
representation, and said violent crimes against people are more important than 
the motivations behind criminal acts. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is another logistical step in assuring everyone in our community that 
Glendale is a city for all people," said the Rev. Phil Wood of the First United 
Methodist Church, a task force member. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're only as strong as we can be together," he added. "This resolution will 
show the world that Glendale is pro-active against hate crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 Community activist Emzy Veazy III, however, excoriated the mayor for not 
including representatives from the entire community in her selection of 
task-force members and demanded that a new group be created and that it include 
an African American representative from within the city's boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 "This city is selective in their categorization of hate crimes," Veazy said. 
"The black community is continually excluded from these kinds of concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are larger socioeconomic problems here, which the city will not 
address." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. David E. Wallis said "a Blue Ribbon commission on hate crime is a 
preposterous overreaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where's the Blue Ribbon commission for denouncing other, more serious crimes 
such as muggings, rape and white-collar fraud? 
</P>
<P>
 "We pay for an excellent Police Department to handle crime and should, simply, 
leave it to their expertise. It is not a city function to 'denounce' anything, 
but to make sure things run reliably." 
</P>
<P>
 City Councilman Sheldon Baker responded to Wallis in tears, saying there is no 
such thing as an overreaction to such incidents. "Why don't you explain that to 
the victims?" Baker asked. 
</P>
<P>
 "Explain it to those who suffered from the Holocaust or to the Cambodians 
bombed during the Vietnam War?"

FATHER GETS 1-YEAR SENTENCE IN CRASH

 A 42-year-old father was sentenced to one year in jail Tuesday because his 
5-year-old son was injured in a traffic accident while not wearing a seat belt, 
according to the Los Angeles city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell Gluckman of Canoga Park pleaded no contest to one count each of child 
endangerment, hit-and-run driving and possession of a fraudulently obtained 
driver's license, according to City Atty.James Hahn. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Gluckman was driving with his son, who was not wearing a seat belt, 
on Saticoy Street near Reseda Boulevard. Gluckman's car struck a stationary car 
at 35 m.p.h. and the boy's face hit the windshield and cracked the glass, the 
statement read. 
</P>
<P>
 Gluckman showed the driver of the other car a phony driver's license bearing 
the name of his young son before leaving the scene of the accident, according 
to the statement. JEANNETTE REGALADO

REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES TAKE PLEDGE FOR REFORM; CONGRESS: VALLEY POLITICIANS HERE 
AND IN WASHINGTON SIGN GOP 'CONTRACT.' AND A BURBANK DEMOCRAT SIGNS HIS OWN 
VERSION OF PACT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 While voter skepticism about political promises may be at an all-time high, 
San Fernando Valley politicians nevertheless joined in a nationwide flurry of 
soulful pledge-making Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In Woodland Hills, GOP congressional candidate Richard Sybert signed the 
"Republican Contract With America," a 19-page GOP manifesto for reforming the 
federal government and then showed up on the doorstep of his foe, incumbent 
Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills), and urged him to sign it too. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Washington, Reps. Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) and Howard P. 
(Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita) joined GOP House leader Newt Gingrich and more 
than 300 other Republi can incumbents and office-seekers in a solemn ceremony 
to sign the document. 
</P>
<P>
 And finally, in Burbank, Democrat Doug Kahn, seeking to unseat Moorhead, 
signed his own over-sized "Contract with the 27th Congressional District" and 
called Moorhead, a 22-year veteran of Congress, a hypocrite for signing a 
contract that includes a pledge to support term limits. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican document that inspired all this pledge-making urges passage of 
a balanced-budget amendment, term limits for members of Congress, welfare 
reform that would include denying Aid to Families with Dependent Children 
payments to mothers under 18 years of age, tax-reduction measures including a 
reduction of taxes on Social Security benefits and anti-crime measures such as 
a mandatory 10-year sentence for using a gun during commission of a state or 
federal felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats have criticized the document, saying adoption of its planks would 
cost $800 billion, send the federal budget into a deficit tailspin and commit 
GOP lawmakers to an agenda, crafted by ambitious Washington-based GOP 
strategists, who are concerned about power, not about the special circumstances 
and needs of any particular congressional district. 
</P>
<P>
 A congressman's stands should reflect "the will of the people back home, not 
the will of Newt Gingrich and the special interests contributing to GOPAC (a 
political action committee Gingrich controls)," Beilenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Republicans hope the contract will convince voters that the GOP has a 
common-sense reform agenda and make the GOP the majority party in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message of this is no more B.S.," Sybert said as he scrawled his name 
across the GOP contract outside Beilenson's Woodland Hills district office. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert denied the contract simply meant more of the same partisan politics 
that seems to turn off voters. At least for him. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Sybert, a former Cabinet officer in Gov. Pete Wilson's 
Administration, tried to distance himself from the contract's partisan origins. 
Sybert said he had elected to sign the document in Woodland Hills rather than 
in Washington with his GOP confreres to stress his independence. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a lot more interested in representing the people of the district than in 
partisan politics," Sybert said. "This is far more specific than the promises 
that have been made in the past," he added. "Besides it's in the form of a 
contract." 
</P>
<P>
 But Beilenson, whose 24th District stretches from Malibu and the Conejo Valley 
to Sherman Oaks, was not impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fraud . . . one of the most irresponsible political documents I've 
ever seen," the 18-year incumbent said, arguing that the Republican plan is 
long on tax cuts, but short on specifics of where to cut federal spending. 
"This is the same kind of warmed-over Reaganomics that created huge deficits in 
the past," Beilenson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson added that he was in agreement with some of the GOP proposals, 
notably those calling for congressional reform of its own institutions. "I've 
been one of the most outspoken Democrats in favor of trimming the number of 
congressional committees and prohibiting proxy votes (by which lawmakers can 
have others cast votes for them)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Beilenson said he was proud of his own recent votes to support President 
Clinton's deficit-reduction plan and crime bill. Both of these were effective 
and realistic, not pie-in-the-sky measures, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Burbank, Kahn signed a pledge of his own devising that mimicked the GOP 
pledge by including his support for term limits. But it also added a new twist 
-- a pledge that Kahn would refuse to accept any pay hike as a congressman, and 
that he would contribute such money to programs to boost the number of police 
officers in the 27th District. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hypocrisy for Mr. Moorhead to support term limits," said Kahn, who owns 
a typesetting business. "I'll believe it when I see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Moorhead, who represents the 27th District that includes Burbank, 
Glendale and Pasadena, said that his prior skepticism about Proposition 140, 
the California term-limits measure adopted in 1990, had to do with his concern 
that that measure would diminish California's clout in Congress. The measure 
would not affect congressional officeholders until 1998. 
</P>
<P>
 Proposition 140 would disadvantage California, Moorhead said, by forcing its 
senior lawmakers into early retirement while congressional members from other 
states -- not be affected by its limits -- would move into leadership 
positions. Seniority confers power in Congress, Moorhead noted. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, in Santa Clarita, Democrat James Gilmartin, now trying to deny 
freshman congressman McKeon a second term, added his voice to the critics of 
the contract. "By signing the contract, Mr. McKeon has become the puppet of 
Newt Gingrich, not a representative of the people of this district," Gilmartin, 
a Santa Clarita attorney, said.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's just the canned response of the Democratic National Committee," 
snapped Armando Azarloza, McKeon's campaign press deputy. "What we're saying to 
voters is 'Give us Republicans a chance to have a majority in congress, and 
we'll enact some bold reforms,' " he said. "No more of the same old thing."

VALLEY BRIEFING: MAKING THE GRADE; ROUNDUP OF LOCAL SAT RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though surrounded by controversy, the Scholastic Assessment Test--formerly 
called the Scholastic Aptitude Test--continues to be one of the most 
influential factors in determining who gets into four-year colleges and 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The exam includes two sections: a verbal portion that tests reading and 
vocabulary skills and a math component concentrating on arithmetic, algebra and 
geometry. 
</P>
<P>
 The test has been retooled to reflect a shift toward critical reading and away 
from the multiple-choice format that has been a staple since the SAT was 
introduced in 1926. The new test also includes some "grid-in" questions on the 
math portion, which require test-takers to come up with their own responses 
instead of choosing from several choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall scores in the Los Angeles Unified School District declined for the 
fifth consecutive year, although most students at San Fernando Valley schools 
do better than their urban counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys High School was the highest-ranked Los Angeles Unified school in the 
San Fernando Valley, with average scores of 473 on the verbal section and 556 
in math. (A perfect scores is 800 in either section.) 
</P>
<P>
 Student scores in the Antelope, Conejo and Santa Clarita valleys are generally 
higher than in Los Angeles Unified.

ASPCA MEETS IN BURBANK, 1ST TIME OUTSIDE NEW YORK; PROTEST: ANIMAL-RIGHTS 
ACTIVISTS SAY GROUP USES PETS AS A FRONT FOR ITS FUND-RAISING ACTIVITIES IN 
MANHATTAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the country's 
largest animal welfare group, Tuesday held its annual meeting outside New York 
for the first time in 128 years, which protesters contended was an attempt to 
escape controversy there. 
</P>
<P>
 But a half-dozen or so animal-rights activists showed up anyway to conduct a 
brief protest, calling the ASPCA "a fund-raising organization that uses animals 
as a front." 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters who lined up outside the Burbank Airport Hilton hotel were 
forced to leave by the hotel's management after about 20 minutes of handing out 
literature and waving placards. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Felicia Sukur, an organizer of the protest, said she believes the group 
sent a message to ASPCA officials that "they can't run from the truth just by 
running away from New York," where the organization has its headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been looked into by both the state attorney general and the Manhattan 
district attorney's office," Sukur said. "People in New York are starting to 
become very disgusted with this organization and its problems, and I think they 
felt there would be a lot of protest if they met there, but we followed them." 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 people attended the ASPCA meeting at the hotel to hear reports on 
the workings of the nonprofit organization, which has a $22 million budget, 
employs about 225 people and has more than 300,000 contributing members 
nationwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials conceded that, since its founding 128 years ago, the organization 
had always met in New York, but said it met in Burbank this year because the 
organization is expanding its operations in the Los Angeles area and because it 
is in the process of pulling out of the New York City animal shelter system, 
which it has managed under contract for 100 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The ASPCA's $4.5-million annual contract with New York City will not be 
renewed, and the shelters will be managed by a new not-for-profit organization 
created by the city, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are in a state of transition," said John Foran, executive vice president 
and chief administrative officer. "We're getting out of the business of running 
shelters and moving toward attacking the problem of massive dog and cat 
overpopulation throughout the country." 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, the ASPCA has been the target of intensive press scrutiny. 
Earlier this year, the New York Post published a series of articles on what the 
Post called the "Puppy-Gate" scandal, saying ASPCA workers were padding their 
salaries, some making twice their annual base pay in overtime. 
</P>
<P>
 The protesters outside Tuesday's meeting were members of the Harry Bergh 
Coalition, named for the ASPCA's founder. They said that they are convinced the 
organization is rife with financial misconduct, and that they believe probes by 
the New York state attorney general into allegations of charity fraud, and by 
the Manhattan district attorney into charges of health violations at a shelter, 
failed to clear the society. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a city of 8 million people, with only two animal shelters. One of 
them is in the city's most crime-infested neighborhood and the other one has 
been cited because the animals were living in such poor conditions," said Livi 
French, founder of the Bergh coalition, in a telephone interview from New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are a nationwide organization whose purpose is to raise money. They do 
not care about New York's animal overpopulation problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Foran conceded that the ASPCA has had its share of problems in recent years. 
He said he joined the organization about one year ago, at a time when about 20 
high-ranking officials were discharged by the board of directors after 
questions about the society's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said charges that the ASPCA is more concerned with cash than animal 
welfare are "ludicrous," and that the society was given "a clean bill of 
health" after the probes by both the state attorney general and the city 
district attorney.

TRANSIENT ORDERED TO STAND TRIAL; COURTS: MAN IS ACCUSED OF ATTEMPTED RAPE WITH 
A 15-YEAR-OLD GIRL WITH DOWN'S SYNDROME WHO HAD BEEN THE OBJECT OF A SEARCH.

 She called him "Mister Senor," told police that he was her boyfriend and that 
they spent the night together in his van, according to police testimony Tuesday 
at his preliminary hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 He told police that she was "a very experienced woman" who had "latched on" to 
him in the park the afternoon of July 18. He said he didn't think that they'd 
done anything wrong, an officer testified. 
</P>
<P>
 But, on the grounds that she is 15, has an IQ of about 50 and doesn't 
understand the concept of consensual sex, Deputy Dist. Atty. Phillip H. 
Rabichow alleges that what Guillermo Ayon did July 18 with a teen-ager with 
Down's syndrome is attempted rape. 
</P>
<P>
 Ayon, a 37-year-old transient who lived in a van he usually kept near a park 
in Van Nuys, faces a dozen years in state prison if convicted of attempting to 
rape a person incapable of giving consent. 
</P>
<P>
 After hearing testimony from Los Angeles Police Detective Robert Peloquin, Van 
Nuys Municipal Judge Jessica Perrin Silvers ordered Ayon held for trial on 
charges of attempted rape and oral copulation. Rape and child-concealing 
charges were dismissed. 
</P>
<P>
 The teen-ager was the object of a highly publicized search after she wandered 
away from her home in Woodland Hills. More than 90 people participated in the 
24-hour search and more than 1,300 leaflets bearing her likeness were 
distributed along Ventura Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 She was found when a security guard at the Van Nuys production offices of the 
TV teen soap opera "Beverly Hills 90210" recognized her and separated her from 
Ayon after they asked directions to nearby Delano Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Actress Tori Spelling, who was at the office, spent about an hour with the 
girl before her parents arrived, authorities said. It was unclear whether 
Spelling would be called as a witness in the case.

'SHADOW BOX' SPENDING RESTRICTIONS LIFTED; POLICE: CITY COUNCIL VOTES 
UNANIMOUSLY TO REMOVE LIMIT ON MEMORIAL PLAQUES FOR SLAIN OFFICERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Prompted by the outrage of police over an austere memorial to a rookie police 
officer killed in the line of duty, the Los Angeles City Council voted 
unanimously Tuesday to eliminate a spending restriction on memorial plaques for 
slain police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation by Councilman Joel Wachs modifies the law that in the past 
provided only enough money -- about $200 -- to mount the officer's badge on a 
plaque, which was given to the family at the officer's funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new law, the city will pay to include the officer's gun, medals, 
pins, whistles and any other personal items requested by the slain officer's 
family and friends. The memorials, known as "shadow boxes," would cost no more 
than $500 each, Wachs said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more than just a matter of money. It is a matter of appreciation and 
respect," the councilman said. The motion is expected to be signed into law 
today by Mayor Richard Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Wachs' attention was drawn to the law by police officers and friends of 
Officer Christy Hamilton who were outraged when they learned they had to pay to 
include more than a badge on a framed plaque. Hamilton, a rookie officer, was 
killed while responding Feb. 22 to a domestic dispute call in Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers who helped arrange Hamilton's memorial plaque and funeral said that 
while trying to raise money for the fancier plaque, they found that many 
officers were so financially strapped by home damage from the Northridge quake 
that they had little to donate for a plaque. In the end, they opted for the 
free version, but under the new law will present a more elaborate one to her 
family in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton was the 11th Los Angeles police officer killed in the line of duty 
since 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Dennis Zine, a director for the Los Angeles Police Protective League, said it 
is not generally known among officers that the city has only been willing to 
pay for the simpler plaque. But that restriction, he said, has "been symbolic 
of how the city treats its employees." 
</P>
<P>
 Zine praised Wachs for spearheading the change, saying he is glad "there are 
City Council people like Joel Wachs who demonstrate their support for Los 
Angeles' law enforcement community."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; MAN REACHES SETTLEMENT OVER TELEMARKETING 
CALLS; LITIGATION: BOB ARKOW SUES TIME WARNER CABLE AFTER HE ASKED THE COMPANY 
TO STOP CONTACTING HIM. THE COMPANY HAS VOWED TO EXAMINE ITS POLICIES. 
</P>

<P>
 If you hate calls from telemarketers, Bob Arkow is your hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkow, 44, who takes telemarketers to court over repeated solicitation calls, 
has chalked up yet another victory. He reached an out-of-court settlement last 
week in his lawsuit against Time Warner Cable, which has 21,500 customers in 
the Santa Clarita Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Arkow nor company officials would discuss specifics of the settlement, 
but they did disclose that it included compensation for Arkow and a promise by 
the company that it would examine its telemarketing policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this year, Arkow accepted a settlement in a similar suit against the 
Prodigy Services computer network. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkow said his lawsuits are wake-up calls to the companies who use 
telemarketing. "I think eventually what happens if you kick this thing up in 
the corporation, someone says, 'Hey, this isn't the right thing to be doing to 
our customers,' " Arkow said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Time Warner Cable lawsuit was resolved just days before a judge was 
scheduled to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arkow, who works as a telecommunications specialist for the state, had first 
threatened to sue the company last year for allegedly violating federal 
telemarketing regulations by continuing to call him after he formally requested 
that they stop. 
</P>
<P>
 The company gave him $500 worth of free services in compensation and he 
dropped plans to sue. 
</P>
<P>
 But when he got yet another call in July, he made good on his threat, filing a 
lawsuit that sought $2,000 plus legal fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott Binder, president of the cable company, said the company wanted to take 
care of the matter as quickly as possible. "The last thing we wanted to do was 
be in lawsuits with our customers," Binder said. 
</P>
<P>
 He admitted that Arkow's complaints had at least partial merit. "Some of his 
complaints were things we could improve on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkow encourages others bothered by telemarketing calls to take action. He 
suggested that they first ask a caller if they have a do-not-call policy, as 
required. If they do, you can request to be put on the do-not-call list. If 
they don't, you should inform them of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Just threatening legal action, Arkow said, is sometimes enough to ensure that 
they don't call again. 
</P>
<P>
 Arkow, for one, plans to continue to do more than threaten. He said he will 
soon take legal action against a financial institution.

 Two women killed in an 11-vehicle accident on the Golden State Freeway near 
Pyramid Lake last week have been identified as sisters traveling in the same 
car, authorities said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Cheryle Reeder, 42, of Riverside died at the scene of the accident, which 
occurred about 3:20 p.m. Friday on the northbound side of the freeway, 
California Highway Patrol Officer Wendy Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reeder, sitting in the front passenger seat of the car, was thrown into the 
windshield, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Her sister, Alice Hamilton, 35, of Burbank, was in the back seat and suffered 
severe head injuries. She was taken by helicopter to Henry Mayo Newhall 
Memorial Hospital in Valencia, where she died about 4 a.m. Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight other people had injuries ranging from minor to severe in the accident, 
which forced officials to close most of the northbound side of the freeway for 
more than four hours. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident apparently occurred because some vehicles were traveling at high 
speed during a rainstorm, Moore said. MARK SABBATINI

$216-MILLION RESCUE DEAL WOULD REVIVE 20TH CENTURY; INSURANCE: AMERICAN 
INTERNATIONAL GROUP WOULD CONTROL UP TO 43% OF STOCK AND GAIN A NATIONAL 
PLATFORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 American International Group Inc., the nation's largest commercial insurer, 
unveiled a $216-million rescue package Tuesday for 20th Century Industries that 
would simultaneously bolster 20th Century's earthquake-depleted capital and 
give AIG a platform for expanding into the auto insurance business nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal means that Woodland Hills-based 20th Century's survival is no longer 
in question, analysts said, but its independence is a thing of the past. 
</P>
<P>
 If the transaction is completed, New York City-based AIG will control up to 
43% of 20th Century's stock, by far the largest single block. AIG would also 
get two seats on 20th Century's 11-member board. 
</P>
<P>
 The two companies said they will also form a strategic alliance to sell auto 
insurance nationwide, using as a model the low-cost, direct-marketing approach 
that 20th Century pioneered in California. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear what the deal means for 20th Century's management and employees. 
Richard Dinon, a 20th Century vice president, said he expects few changes, 
because AIG recognizes that 20th Century keeps expenses low and is profitable 
in auto insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 With more than two-thirds of its surplus, or cushion against losses, wiped out 
by an estimated $815 million in losses from the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, 
20th Century had few alternatives other than to seek a partner with deep 
pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of the world's most profitable insurers, AIG qualifies. Led by its 
aggressive and outspoken chairman, Maurice R. (Hank) Greenberg, AIG operates in 
130 countries and had $113 billion in assets as of June 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rescue package came at a critical time" for 20th Century, said John H. 
Snyder, senior vice president of the insurance rating firm of A.M. Best Co. "We 
were ready to substantially reduce their rating again." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, A.M. Best placed 20th Century's two insurance units, 20th Century 
Insurance Co. and 21st Century Casualty Co., on review "with positive 
implications," meaning that their B- (adequate) ratings for claims-paying 
ability will probably be upgraded. 
</P>
<P>
 Rival Standard & Poor's also placed its CCC (extremely vulnerable) rating of 
20th Century on review for likely upgrade. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors welcomed the news, driving 20th Century's stock to $11.125, up 
$1.75, or 19%, in heavy trading Tuesday on the New York Stock Exchange. AIG 
shares eased 12.5 cents to $89.875.  
</P>
<P>
 Here is how the deal works: AIG would pay 20th Century $200 million for a new 
issue of 9% cumulative convertible preferred stock. The stock can be converted 
at any time at AIG's option into 20th Century common stock at a price of $11.33 
a share -- up to 17.7 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 AIG would pay another $16 million for warrants to purchase 16 million 
additional shares of 20th Century common stock at $13.50 apiece. AIG also 
agreed to provide another $70 million in standby capital and reinsurance if 
needed. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a so-called lockup provision: If the deal collapses, AIG would 
have the right to purchase 15% of 20th Century's stock at a price of $11.33 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
 If AIG were to convert all of the preferred stock (including dividends) and 
exercise all of the warrants, its stake could be as high as 43%, A.M. Best's 
Snyder said. 
</P>
<P>
 Twentieth Century directors, including the family of company founder and 
Chairman Louis W. Foster, currently hold the largest voting block, about 25% of 
the stock. Their stake would dwindle to 15% if AIG exercised all its options. 
</P>
<P>
 Neil H. Ashley, 20th Century chief executive, said in a statement: "Sometimes 
good things come out of adversity, and that's how I view this opportunity with 
AIG. Not only is the capital availability needed, the opportunity to apply our 
personal-lines expertise over a broader geographic area is an exciting 
development." 
</P>
<P>
 AIG had earlier targeted domestic auto insurance and other "personal lines" as 
an area for expansion, "and this investment in 20th Century is a further step 
in that direction," chairman Greenberg said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 The transaction is subject to approval by the California Insurance Department, 
which was briefed on the proposed deal last week by 20th Century 
representatives. The regulators had ordered 20th Century to present a plan for 
boosting its surplus to one-third of its annual premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pleased that they have submitted a plan and will give it a close 
review," Insurance Department spokeswoman Elena Stern said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi granted 20th Century a 6% rate hike 
Sept. 14, part of which was meant to rebuild surplus. The increase will be 
scaled back to 3% when the surplus reaches one-third of premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 After the infusion from AIG, 20th Century's surplus would be about one-fourth 
of premiums, estimated John A. Hall, an analyst for Northington Partners in 
Avon, Conn. "That's still a little high, but it's certainly a lot better than a 
month ago," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides earthquake losses, 20th Century also faces a $119-million liability in 
the form of Proposition 103 rebates ordered last month by the California 
Supreme Court. Expecting to win its challenge to the implementation of the 1988 
insurance rollback initiative, 20th Century had set aside only $50 million in 
reserves for possible rebates.

FAMILY OF DOCTOR WINS SUIT IN FATAL HELICOPTER CRASH; PRODUCT LIABILITY: JURY 
AWARDS $4.5 MILLION, FINDING MANUFACTURER PARTLY TO BLAME FOR MISTAKE THAT 
KILLED O.C. SURGEON. COMPANY VOWS APPEAL. 
</P>

<P>
 A Superior Court jury awarded about $4.5 million Tuesday to the family of a 
prominent Orange County surgeon who died in a helicopter crash two years ago, 
finding that the maker of the aircraft shared some responsibility for the 
accident. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the jury found that Dr. Todd L. Passoff was mostly responsible for 
the accident, it found that the craft made by Robinson Helicopter Co. had a 
control panel design defect that contributed to the crash. 
</P>
<P>
 The company promised an appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Wayne Austero, who represented Passoff's family, contended during the 
trial that the doctor inadvertently pulled a lever shutting off the fuel to the 
engine of the helicopter, which stalled and crashed, because the lever was 
placed dangerously close to other levers needed to fly the aircraft. Austero 
also contended that the lever's safety guard was inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he hoped the verdict would prompt a design change in the Robinson 
model R-22, believed to be the nation's biggest-selling light helicopter, which 
is bought by many police departments because it costs only one-sixth as much as 
the smallest turbojet helicopter built by the larger and better known 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's human. Everybody can make a mistake," Austero said in an 
interview outside the courtroom. "The product should be designed to take in 
mind that people operate these. There are human frailties." 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter company, however, said the craft's design was not responsible 
for the crash, and that the fuel mixture lever in question had a plastic safety 
sleeve to prevent accidents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just feel there were some pressures that Dr. Passoff placed on himself -- 
dedication to his family and medical profession -- that didn't allow him to 
stay current and proficient as a helicopter pilot," attorney Allen L. Neelley, 
who represented Robinson Helicopter Co., said outside the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash occurred May 8, 1992, just after Passoff lifted off from Anaheim 
Memorial Medical Center, where he had just completed a knee joint replacement. 
He was en route to a sports medicine clinic he operated in Temecula. Passoff, 
43, lived in Newport Beach with his wife and two young daughters. He had been 
on the staff of the Anaheim hospital since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Robinson, owner of the Torrance-based company, said he would appeal the 
verdict on several points, including what he believes were misleading jury 
instructions involving product liability law. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should not have been any percentage responsible" for the accident, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said the control panel design challenged in the trial was the "best 
that you could do." 
</P>
<P>
 "Had the jury known all the facts surrounding that design and the other 
alternatives, I'm sure they would have found us zero responsible for the 
accident," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury announced its verdict after a day and a half of deliberations. A 
replica of the helicopter cockpit was among evidence considered during trial, 
which lasted almost two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors Julie White of Yorba Linda and Charmaine Peterson of Newport Beach said 
they spent eight hours deciding whether the helicopter controls in question 
were poorly designed. Once the majority agreed that a defect existed, the 
hardest issue was dividing responsibility for the accident, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was tough," White said. "You're dealing with not only negligence or a 
design defect, but negligence on the pilot's part." 
</P>
<P>
 The case also carried an emotional toll, they added. "No amount is worth 
losing a loved one," White said. 
</P>
<P>
 In calculating the award, the jury included about $19.5 million in economic 
damages and $3 million in non-economic damages, but found the helicopter 
manufacturer liable for only 20% of the total. 
</P>
<P>
 Among witnesses called by the Passoff family was Jerry Wells, an expert at 
investigating plane crashes. He testified that the helicopter would have been 
safer if the fuel mixture control lever, which regulates the flow of fuel from 
the carburetor to the engine, had been placed in a more remote location in the 
cockpit. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,500 Robinson R-22 helicopters have been sold since the Federal 
Aviation Administration certified the aircraft in 1979. The craft sells for 
about $115,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson said this is the first R-22 product liability lawsuit the company has 
ever lost, and that there has not been a single report of a pilot, other than 
Passoff, pulling the wrong control since the company added the plastic 
safeguard 12 years ago.

FED DECIDES NOT TO RAISE INTEREST RATES AGAIN; ECONOMY: ANALYSTS WARN OF 
ANOTHER INCREASE SOON. SOME BUSINESSES, WHICH SAW OVERTIGHTENING, EXPRESS 
RELIEF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Ending weeks of speculation, the Federal Reserve Board decided Tuesday not to 
raise interest rates for the sixth time this year, but experts cautioned that 
another increase is probably not far off. 
</P>
<P>
 In a terse statement, the nation's central bank said a meeting of the Federal 
Open Market Committee, a key Fed panel, "ended at 1 p.m. There will be no 
further announcements." 
</P>
<P>
 Some business spokesmen welcomed the inaction by the Fed, which has been 
raising interest rates to keep the economy from overheating and sparking 
inflation. "We are thrilled the Fed has decided to wait until the picture is 
clearer on inflation and growth," said Jerry Jasinowski, president of the 
National Assn. of Manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our people feel inflation is not accelerating," he said. "The Fed wisely 
decided not to make a decision about an issue where they are unclear." 
</P>
<P>
 But Martin Regalia, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's chief economist, said he 
would be "flabbergasted" if the Fed does not raise rates again before November. 
Regalia speculated that the open market committee on Tuesday may have given Fed 
Chairman Alan Greenspan the authority to raise rates before the panel meets 
again Nov. 15.  
</P>
<P>
 Corporations are fearful that the Fed risks tightening too much. Mortgage 
rates have already climbed past 8%, putting a crimp in the housing market. But 
the bond markets demand aggressive action. Inflation eats away at the value of 
bonds and other financial instruments. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, investors reacted to the Fed's lack of action Tuesday by driving 
market rates up even higher. The yield on the 30-year Treasury bond rose to a 
27-month high of 7.84%, up from 7.79% on Monday, indicating that investors also 
believe more rate increases are coming. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed could use almost any reason to justify a new round of rate hikes: an 
unusual surge in jobs during the next employment report, a burst in retail or 
wholesale prices, a sudden slump in stock prices or a spurt on bonds yields. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect they have opted to wait and see what the economic data look like 
over the next couple of weeks," said Gary Schlossberg, vice president of Wells 
Fargo Bank.  
</P>
<P>
 "The odds favor a move sometime in October," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed members "are a bunch of people who have made up their minds" to impose 
further rate increases, said Jeff Faux, president of the Economic Policy 
Institute, a liberal think tank.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "It smells like they are holding it for the employment numbers or for the 
(current) Japan trade negotiations to fall through or for something else to 
blame it on," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The September jobless report is scheduled to be released Oct. 7, and the size 
of the job growth will be viewed as a key measure of the health of the economy. 
While a sharp increase in new jobs would indicate the national economy is 
expanding, Fed members would probably see the increase as an ominous sign that 
the economy is overheating. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Rudy Oswald, chief economist of the AFL-CIO, argued that the Fed has 
already tightened too much, noting that real wages of workers after inflation 
are slightly below those of a year ago, while job totals in construction and 
manufacturing are still lagging behind the pre-recession level of 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Many labor leaders, business executives and politicians see the Fed as an 
excessively conservative institution, whose actions to restrain credit have 
damaged the economy's healthy growth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed has raised rates five times this year, with the most recent increase 
coming Aug. 16, when the discount rate -- the rate charged to banks for 
borrowing from the Fed -- was boosted to 4% from 3.5%. At the same time, the 
federal funds rate -- the interest banks charge each other for overnight loans 
-- rose to 4.75% from 4.25%. 
</P>
<P>
 These higher rates make business more costly at all levels, forcing companies 
to pay more to finance their activities ranging from building a new plant to 
obtaining a line of credit for buying merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Fed began raising rates in February, the prime rate has climbed to 
7.75% from 6%. Many consumer and mortgage loans are also tied to the prime -- a 
benchmark rate that banks charge their most credit-worthy customers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed could feel more freedom to raise rates again after the November 
elections, to avoid having its policies become embroiled in congressional 
campaigns, noted Marco Budgyk, managing director at Houlihan Lokey Howard & 
Zukin, a Los Angeles investment management firm.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are always politicians who want to remove the independence of the Fed," 
he said. "Unless the Fed feels the case is compelling, unless there is 
overwhelming evidence, they probably won't do anything until November."  
</P>
<P>
 * MARKET REACTION

MARKET BEAT / TOM PETRUNO: FAILED FUND IS 'EXHIBIT A' IN LEVITT TESTIMONY ON 
DERIVATIVES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. went to Capitol 
Hill on Tuesday to talk about risk in the mutual fund industry, and he brought 
some startling news to underscore his point: the first outright failure of a 
money market fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC announced that the Denver-based Community Bankers U.S. Government 
Money Market fund will liquidate because of losses caused by so-called 
derivative securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund's 90-some shareholders -- all institutional clients -- will get back 
94 cents for each $1 they invested. 
</P>
<P>
 For the $2-trillion mutual fund industry, the demise of the Denver fund is 
both a black eye and a blessing. Until now, investors had never lost a penny in 
a money fund, a fact that has allowed these funds to develop an unwarranted 
reputation for complete safety since 1974. 
</P>
<P>
 But if a money fund were going to fail, the industry couldn't ask for a better 
victim. The Denver fund's assets were only $82 million, and no small investors 
were in it. So the SEC can use the isolated incident of this fund's collapse to 
force all investors to sit up and take notice, without risk of inciting a 
public "run" on money funds. 
</P>
<P>
 For Levitt, the Denver fund's failure because of derivative-securities losses 
provided the perfect backdrop for his testimony before a House subcommittee. 
His message: The fund industry's painful experience this year with exotic 
securities such as derivatives highlights the need for a standard way of 
measuring and disclosing fund risk -- so that shareholders (and perhaps 
regulators) aren't blindsided. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives, which are hybrid, often "synthetic" securities created by Wall 
Street, have been used by mutual funds for years. They can be as simple as 
futures or options contracts, or vastly more complex. They can be used to 
speculate on market moves -- taking fund investors way out on the risk curve -- 
or, conversely, they can be used to hedge a portfolio, thereby reducing the 
fund's risk. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, many money market funds and bond funds were hit by surprise losses 
when derivative securities they had purchased went awry, mostly because 
interest rates have risen faster than most Wall Streeters expected. Some of the 
losing funds -- including, until now, all of the money funds -- bailed out 
shareholders by going to their parent companies for cash infusions to cover 
losses. 
</P>
<P>
 But those costly bailouts haven't lessened the concern on Capitol Hill that 
the fund industry has been playing haphazardly with shareholders' money in 
high-risk derivatives, while shareholders may have blithely assumed that all 
they owned was plain-vanilla stocks or bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to congressional pressure, the SEC has proposed cutting the maximum 
a fund can invest in "illiquid" securities, including most derivatives, from 
the current 15% of assets to 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 More important for most fund shareholders, however, would be better disclosure 
of derivative investments and their uses in funds -- because the simple fact 
is, these hybrid issues aren't going away, and neither should they. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem isn't the securities," says James Midanek, a derivatives 
authority at Solon Asset Management in Walnut Creek, Calif. "The problem is 
people bought things they didn't understand." 
</P>
<P>
 But can derivative risk, and mutual fund risk generally, be standardized in 
some way that is accurate and easy for most fund investors to understand in 
fund literature? One early proposal was that funds merely disclose the 
percentage of their assets in derivatives. Yet some fund industry executives 
say that would barely be useful. 
</P>
<P>
 Stephen Gibson, managing director of retail marketing at Putnam Funds in 
Boston, notes that "it doesn't take a lot of poorly structured derivatives to 
create considerable risk in a fund." So a low percentage of derivatives, 
depending on their type, might wrongly suggest to shareholders that there is 
little risk of loss from the securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC, and the Investment Company Institute (the funds' trade group), now 
seem to be leaning in another direction: Requiring of each fund standardized, 
plain-English disclosure of such common risk barometers as "beta" (a measure of 
volatility) and, for income-oriented funds, "duration," which measures how a 
fund's principal changes with rising or falling interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether those yardsticks of risk could then be combined into something far 
more simple in fund literature -- say, a numerical scale by which funds would 
identify their risk level as somewhere between one and 10 -- is far from clear. 
Such a system may sound ideal, but it may also be so simplistic as to be 
misleading, fund experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's, the credit-rating agency, this year began providing ratings 
of bond and money fund risk for funds willing to pay for them. Research firm 
Morningstar Inc. already calculates fund betas and other such barometers for 
its subscribers. But the ICI understandably argues that the industry should 
standardize something that can be done in-house by each fund. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC will seek public opinion on risk disclosure ideas early in 1995. But 
analysts say that, no matter what new format for disclosure emerges, the best 
way for investors to avoid dicey funds is to follow one rule: If a fund's 
return is above-average, it's probably taking above-average risk. If you're not 
an above-average risk-taker, avoid funds that shoot for the moon. S&P's Fund 
Rating System 
</P>
<P>
 In an attempt to help bond mutual fund investors better understand the 
relative risk in their funds, Standard & Poor's Corp. has developed a rating 
system similar to its bond credit rating system. How S&P characterizes funds: 
</P>
<P>
 Rating / Bond fund description: 
</P>
<P>
 AAA: Extremely low sensitivity to changing market conditions and offers 
greatest stability of returns 
</P>
<P>
 AA: Low sensitivity to changing market conditions and offers stable returns 
over short and intermediate horizons 
</P>
<P>
 A: Sensitive to changing market conditions and offers stable returns over 
intermediate and long horizons 
</P>
<P>
 BBB: More sensitive to changing market conditions and will have greater 
variability of returns, but have adequate stability over long horizons 
</P>
<P>
 BB: Very sensitive to changing market conditions, so returns can be volatile, 
especially over short or intermediate horizons 
</P>
<P>
 B: Extremely sensitive to changing market conditions, and may possess 
speculative characteristics, with returns highly volatile over all holding 
periods

METALLICA SUES LABEL, CHALLENGING '7-YEAR' CONTRACT STATUTE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHUCK PHILIPS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a move that could upend performers' contracts throughout the recording 
industry, Metallica, one of the nation's biggest-selling hard-rock groups, sued 
Time Warner's Elektra Entertainment on Tuesday to end its decade-long 
association with the Elektra label. 
</P>
<P>
 The Grammy-winning group, which has sold an estimated 40 million albums 
worldwide for Elektra since 1984, is basing its claim on a controversial 
California law designed to free actors from long-term studio deals. The law is 
untested in the music business. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the so-called seven-year statute, entertainers cannot be tied to any 
company for more than seven years. Some record companies say the statute does 
not apply to recording acts but that they have been reluctant to test it for 
fear of an exodus of veteran artists. If the lawsuit succeeds, recording 
artists could attain, every seven years, a free-agency status similar to that 
of professional athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 Previous threatened showdowns over the statute -- including recent cases filed 
by singers Don Henley and Luther Vandross against Geffen Records and Epic 
Records, respectively -- were avoided when artists settled out of court. 
</P>
<P>
 "A win for Metallica could have a dramatic impact on the music business," said 
entertainment lawyer Don Engel, who represented Henley and Vandross in their 
seven-year-statute battles. "Record companies have been trying to brush this 
issue under the rug for decades. If Metallica wins, you can bet other 
performers who are unhappy with their contracts will follow their lead." 
</P>
<P>
 Metallica's dispute follows a Warner Music corporate shake-up that was 
orchestrated by Warner Music Group Chairman Robert Morgado in August. The 
revamp led to the resignation of Robert Krasnow as chairman of Elektra 
Entertainment and the announcement by Mo Ostin, longtime chairman of Warner 
Bros. Records, that he would resign Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Music Group, the world's largest recording company, is a unit of Time 
Warner. 
</P>
<P>
 Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich said the band's lawsuit was prompted by what he 
called "greedy and arrogant" behavior by Morgado, who Ulrich says reneged on a 
promise by Krasnow to restructure the band's deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our faith in this company has been flushed down the drain," Ulrich said. 
"Elektra used to have a reputation as a label that treated artists with 
respect. Now it's just another place where arrogant business people break 
promises." 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for Warner Music Group said the company had not seen the suit, 
which was filed in San Francisco County Superior Court, and declined to 
comment. Calls to Elektra were not returned, and Morgado was not available for 
comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulrich said Krasnow promised last spring to restructure the band's 10-year-old 
contract into a joint venture in which the band and the label would in effect 
become partners. In seeking the deal, the band waived personal advances in 
favor of a profit-sharing arrangement.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; GETTING THE MESSAGE; 
EXPANSION PLAN BY OWNER OF ON-LINE SERVICE SETS OFF AN ELECTRONIC UPROAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY HARMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 5:32 last Friday evening, Bruce Katz posted an electronic message on the 
Well, the venerable Sausalito-based on-line service of which he is the owner. 
</P>
<P>
 He would be taking over day-to-day operations, it said. Longtime General 
Manager Maurice Weitman would be moving to an advisory position. A few other 
changes, like making the service more accessible to new users, were also afoot. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the evening, Topic No. 1639 on the bulletin board's News forum 
was crammed with responses -- the number has since surpassed 500 -- accusing 
Katz of sacrificing the Well's soul with his plans to expand, reorganize and 
perhaps make some money. Howard Rheingold, one of cyberspace's best-known 
citizens, had threatened to resign from the firm's board. And there were 
repeated demands for Katz to face his critics on-line. 
</P>
<P>
 The uproar, which continued this week, reflects the growing pains at one of 
the nation's oldest and best-known electronic communities. And it has broader 
implications -- about how community will be redefined in an era when technology 
is making it increasingly easy to cross geographical and cultural boundaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Some Well-ites argue that while the much-touted information superhighway may 
create one big virtual world, people will always want to congregate -- 
virtually or otherwise -- in small groups with others who share common 
interests. The Well -- an acronym for Whole Earth 'Lectronic Link -- says one 
longtime member, is "where you go to be high-minded, not to find a new 'Vette" 
-- and many of its members want it to stay that way, business considerations be 
damned. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, a former shoe magnate who bought the Well earlier this year, is trying 
to bring the service into the modern age. It currently looks and feels about 
the same as it did when it was founded a decade ago -- it still uses a 
cumbersome, text-only interface -- and that just isn't the way to tap the huge 
new market of would-be cybercitizens. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Katz, who made a mint as co-founder of Rockport Shoes, has suddenly 
discovered that his on-line customers have a different sort of power than most 
shareholders -- and they like to exercise it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saturday night I wasn't sure I had the courage to go on line," said Katz, who 
by Tuesday had won over some of his harshest critics through electronic 
give-and-take. "Sometimes I'm dismayed, but I'm learning the extent to which 
this community views the company as their territory and their sanctuary and 
their home." 
</P>
<P>
 What he has yet to find out is whether this community -- and, by extension, 
dozens of other mid-sized, general-interest computer bulletin boards around the 
country -- will be able to hang on to its niches as big media conglomerates 
barge into the on-line world. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "The smaller, narrowcast communities and on-line services are on a river that 
leads to the ocean, and the ocean is the Internet," said Mary Modahl, senior 
technology analyst at the Forrester Group in Cambridge, Mass. "The chances are 
good that all of them will find themselves as servers on a larger network. The 
question is how will they attract people onto them and how will they charge, 
and that challenge remains for the Well and for all communities that are 
for-profit." 
</P>
<P>
 The big commercial on-line services have had rocky expansion experiences in 
recent months too -- in part because they're resented by the old guard. Earlier 
this year, many of America Online's customers were unable to log on to the 
service as the company's computers became too overloaded to handle the growth. 
But the real insult came several months later, when once-isolated AOL connected 
to the global Internet: AOL subscribers were hit with a wave of hostility as 
longtime Internet users complained of blatant ignorance and violations of 
"nettiquette." 
</P>
<P>
 Prodigy Services Co., another on-line service, is planning to connect to the 
Internet within a few weeks, and it is taking pains to train its members "to 
avoid a situation like AOL," said a Prodigy spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 But Well-ites draw a sharp distinction between their on-line environment and 
that of Prodigy or AOL, which one Well member dismisses as having "no 
personality." Those companies provide information such as stock quotes and home 
shopping, while the point of the Well is to "conference." Indeed, the greatest 
fear voiced on Topic 1639 seems to be that the Well will turn into America 
Online. 
</P>
<P>
 "The question is, is this a grass-roots medium that's created by the people 
who use it, or is it a mass medium that delivers a commodity to a passive 
audience?" says Rheingold, author of the recently released "Virtual 
Communities." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it seems that no other on-line entity, big or small, faces quite the 
same philosophical challenges as the Well. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1985 by the nonprofit Point Foundation, publisher of the Whole 
Earth Catalog, the Well has been long been a home to hundreds of 
computer-literate Deadheads from the Bay Area. It also attracts what Rheingold 
describes as "the kind of people who listen to NPR and read Harper's magazine 
and have a willingness to have longer discussions about things that have 
intellectual content." 
</P>
<P>
 But Katz's plans -- which call for opening an office in New York, upgrading 
the Well's ancient interface, forming new Wells in other cities and providing 
high-speed Internet connections to customers -- mean the community of 10,000 or 
so may get an influx of new members. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While some are threatened by the prospect, a growing number of the Well's 
on-line participants seem to think that some change is not such a bad idea. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first monthly bill was $200 because it was so hard to use the interface," 
recalls Kathleen Creighton, a Well member who writes for a computer newspaper. 
"It can get pretty expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to lose the community we've got, but the organization which 
supports it is either going to have to drain off the sour old molasses of the 
'60s or the whole thing is going to die," posted John Perry Barlow, an on-line 
personality who has been on the Well since 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, for a business like the Well, community is commodity. And Katz, who 
says that community is precisely what he wants to foster, is quickly learning 
that that means personal participation -- to a point. 
</P>
<P>
 When he took a 50% stake in the company in 1991, he recalls, the staff was 
spending so much time on-line that no one had time to fix the computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came in and said, 'You have to break away from this damn screen and get an 
air conditioner in the computer room, otherwise the computer breaks and you 
have to spend more time on-line telling people why.' " Similarly, "I don't need 
to have a huge debate about whether new users want a menu-driven interface 
instead of having to remember commands." 
</P>
<P>
 But from his early, tentative postings over the weekend -- "I may soon exceed 
the polite length of a posting so I may have to start Part II . . . pretty 
soon," Katz wrote in one -- the executive has not only won over some 
detractors, but has nearly gotten addicted to posting himself. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm signing on at 1:30 in the morning, at 5:30 in the morning. I got so into 
it, I couldn't turn it off. I'd post something, then somebody else will make a 
posting. Thirty minutes go by, and I'd have to turn it on again and reconnect," 
Katz says. "It's hard to know when to stop." 
</P>
<P>
 This approach seems to be working: "Bruce, I've read your postings with 
interest. . . . I felt you were really there and speaking from the heart," 
posted a one-time critic. "Reading what you have posted in this topic, you seem 
pretty level-headed, and not prone to invective. Good for you -- you'll do OK. 
I have the beginning of what might become respect for you, and I wish you good 
luck." VOICES 
</P>
<P>
 Here are online comments about the Well reorganization: 
</P>
<P>
 "If, as it appears, you are taking over the reins, can you please explain: 
What is your vision for the future of the WELL?" 
</P>
<P>
 --Howard Rheingold 
</P>
<P>
 "We ARE the product. Without us...Bruce doesn't own WELL, he owns a ghost 
town, inhabited with the archives of our words." 
</P>
<P>
 --Kathleen Creighton (casey) 
</P>
<P>
 "It is personally very painful to me to have so many people who don't know me 
from Adam portraying me in ways that they do in some of these conferences."

PEOPLE: DAILY NEWS PROMOTES ROBERT LUND FROM MANAGING EDITOR TO EDITOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Daily News of Los Angeles has promoted Managing Editor Robert W. Lund to 
the post of editor, succeeding Robert W. Burdick, whose departure was announced 
earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Lund, 38, a nine-year Daily News veteran, has been managing editor of the 
Woodland Hills-based newspaper for the past two years.He has also worked at the 
Dallas Times Herald, San Francisco Examiner, Denver Post and Ft. Worth 
Star-Telegram. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily News President and Chief Executive Larry T. Beasley said Lund's "strong 
commitment to local news coverage gave him the edge over many other qualified 
candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 Burdick had been with the paper for 10 years, the last seven as editor, before 
announcing his resignation Sept. 16. He is leaving to become managing editor of 
the Rocky Mountain News in Denver. His resignation followed last month's 
announcement that James Lacher was leaving his post as executive vice president 
to take a position elsewhere in the empire of multimillionaire Jack Kent Cooke, 
owner of the Daily News. Lacher was replaced by Beasley. PATRICE APODACA

U.S. TRADE POLICY ENTERS A CRUCIAL PHASE; COMMERCE: WHITE HOUSE SENDS GATT 
LEGISLATION TO CONGRESS AND BEGINS FINAL NEGOTIATIONS OVER DISPUTE WITH JAPAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES GERSTENZANG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plunging into a crucial, and perhaps climactic, period in its effort to retool 
the nation's trade relations, the White House sent Congress legislation Tuesday 
to implement a new world trade accord and, hours later, began a final round of 
negotiations to calm a roiling dispute with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 With much of its congressional program in tatters and the nation's trade 
deficit headed for record territory, the White House wants badly to demonstrate 
success in the trade arena -- a center of economic activity considered crucial 
to maintaining the current pace of growth and job expansion -- before the 
midterm elections and an Asian-Pacific economic conference in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it can succeed, and just what constitutes success, is far from 
certain. Trade experts are doubtful that the negotiations with Japan will yield 
enough common ground to let the White House claim major progress in opening the 
Japanese auto market by more than a crack, and some allies of the White House 
on Capitol Hill believe in any case that a tough rebuke to Japan might be of 
greater benefit in the short term. 
</P>
<P>
 If no solution is found by Friday's deadline and the Administration imposes 
sanctions, Tokyo may respond by seeking resolution of its disputes with 
Washington in the multinational General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. 
</P>
<P>
 That, in turn, would complicate the Administration's effort to win 
congressional approval next week of the new global trade treaty. The pact, 
negotiated in the so-called Uruguay Round of trade talks, would cut tariffs by 
an average of 40%; lengthen the reach of GATT's successor, the World Trade 
Organization, and, according to the White House, increase the size of the U.S. 
economy by $100 billion to $200 billion in coming years. 
</P>
<P>
 Arriving side by side, the dispute over Japan and the fight to win approval of 
the trade agreement in the House and Senate symbolize what U.S. Trade 
Representative Mickey Kantor said Tuesday is the Administration's attempt to 
use trade laws to pry open foreign markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Uruguay Round is very important from a trade standpoint," said Jeffrey 
Schott, a trade expert at the Institute for International Economics in 
Washington. And the Japan dispute, in which the White House could name Japan as 
a top violator of fair trade practices, carries particular political weight, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The international trade agreement, which was completed last December in Geneva 
after more than seven years of negotiations, must be ratified by 123 
signatories. Failure of the United States to lead that process, Schott and 
others have said, would risk its unraveling. So, too, they said, would a 
proposal raised by Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) to delay a vote 
until next year. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would cast a long shadow on U.S. trade policy, call into question the 
direction the United States is going in and put into doubt the very substantive 
achievements of the Uruguay Round negotiations," Schott said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration hopes that, with ratification by the major trading nations, 
the plan can go into effect Jan. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 By the Administration's estimate, California exports would get a $70-billion 
boost as a result of the agreement's tariff-reducing provisions around the 
world, with much of the increase occurring in such export-intensive industries 
as aerospace, entertainment and computer software. 
</P>
<P>
 Kantor, a Los Angeles lawyer before joining the Clinton Administration, has 
found himself in the midst of an unsettled dispute over whether the 
international agreement would subjugate U.S., state and local laws. Opponents 
of the agreement have repeatedly insisted that under the trade plan, the World 
Trade Organization could overrule safety and health standards issued by 
individual states if the standards were found to limit trade and block access 
to U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Misinformation," Kantor said Tuesday of those claims. "No law or regulation 
-- state, local or federal -- is altered by any action whatsoever, either 
dispute resolution or others."  
</P>
<P>
 Even if the so-called sovereignty issue and efforts to delay the vote do not 
derail the agreement, it still faces questions being raised by Sen. Ernest F. 
Hollings (D-S.C.) about the threats more open trade rules might pose to the 
struggling U.S. textile industry and by others about how the Administration 
would cover the $12 billion that the pact would cost in lost tariff revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 In what one White House official conceded was a "serious hurdle," Hollings 
sent word that he would try to block final action on the pact by refusing to 
let it out of the Senate Commerce Committee, which he chairs.

MORE THAN 11,000 STRIKE GM PLANT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 More than 11,000 hourly workers at General Motors Corp.'s Buick City auto and 
parts complex walked off the job Tuesday, threatening to bring GM's vast 
automotive empire screeching to a halt. 
</P>
<P>
 The strike, the second GM walkout in a month, forced the auto maker to halt 
production of the Oldsmobile 88, Buick LeSabre and Buick Park Avenue cars and 
also several key components used in dozens of other GM vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 If the strike lasts more than a few days, union officials said, as many as 
100,000 GM workers in 21 plants around the country could be idled, costing the 
auto maker hundreds of millions of dollars a day in lost sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruben Burks, director of United Auto Workers Region 1C in Flint, said the 
union is protesting a variety of things, including faster assembly lines, 
numerous health and safety concerns and a heavy reliance on overtime that he 
said is making some workers sick. 
</P>
<P>
 Burks told a news conference that negotiations were scheduled to resume this 
morning. He said the UAW will remain on strike, however, until all issues are 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to make it clear to the world that this strike will not terminate 
until the bargaining team is satisfied that all of our outstanding issues have 
been resolved," Burks said. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the strike, negotiators had been at the bargaining table for 24 hours.

 Sony to Unveil Personal Communicator: Analysts say the device to be introduced 
today provides the first real glimpse of the lofty promises of the first 
hand-held communications gadgets. Using a much-awaited service developed by 
AT&T Co. called PersonaLink, the device acts as a telephone and can also send 
and receive faxes, electronic mail and pages.The system has an intelligent 
agent, an electronic "slave" that has the potential to ferret out information 
and perform tasks requested by the user. Sony Corp.'s paperback-size device, 
called Magic Link, is the latest entry into the market for personal digital 
assistants. Sony said Magic Link will sell for a suggested retail price of 
$995. Extra options include a phone headset, portable computer keyboard and a 
pager card.

 57,000 BMWs in U.S. to Be Recalled: German car maker BMW will recall many of 
its 1993 and 1994 3-series models because the cars don't meet a U.S. safety 
standard for crash tests, the federal government said.A total of 57,000 325i 
sedans and 325is coupes are involved. The recall does not include 325i 
convertibles, any 318 models or the 1995 M3. The National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration said one of the BMWs involved failed a crash test. It 
said a test dummy not wearing a seat belt suffered higher forces on its chest 
than is permitted by federal safety standards. And, the agency said, a 
passenger-side mannequin, also unbelted, suffered higher-than-allowable forces 
on its left leg.

RACKETEERING CHARGES REJECTED IN SUIT AGAINST TOBACCO FIRMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a major victory for the tobacco industry, a federal judge has dismissed the 
first personal-injury class-action suit against cigarette companies brought 
under the powerful federal racketeering law. 
</P>
<P>
 Victor Han, a Philip Morris Cos. spokesman who announced the ruling Tuesday, 
said the industry considers the ruling significant because the case was the 
first to test the use of the statute in tobacco litigation and the judge 
soundly rejected the strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Several other personal-injury class-action cases are pending across the 
country, alleging that cigarette companies have conspired to conceal that 
nicotine is addictive. The recent ruling could discourage plaintiffs' lawyers 
in those suits from adding racketeering charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the federal Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act is 
most commonly associated with criminal mobster and drug cases, the statute also 
allows individuals to seek treble damages in civil cases if a pattern of 
wrongdoing can be established. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Irma Gonzalez of San Diego said that under RICO, the 
plaintiffs must allege injury to business or property and that the U.S. Supreme 
Court has made it clear that personal injuries do not fall into either 
category.

 Ford to Donate $10 Million to UC Riverside: The auto maker said it will give 
the funds to the university over the next nine years to support research and 
technological development aimed at reducing air pollution. The gift, the 
largest in campus history and the largest ever made by Ford Motor Co. in 
California, will help fund the university's 2-year-old Center for Environmental 
Research at its College of Engineering. Among other projects, the center is 
testing how solar energy can be used in a process that creates hydrogen fuel 
for vehicles.

 Caterpillar Hit With 4 More Labor Complaints: The National Labor Relations 
Board has issued four unfair-labor-practice complaints against the Peoria, 
Ill.-based equipment maker, bringing the number of cases involving it to 101. 
The complaints are part of a longstanding fight with the United Auto Workers. 
Members at eight facilities have been on strike since June 21. Caterpillar Inc. 
has offered to submit each of the labor complaints to arbitration, a solution 
the union has rejected. The union charges the company has fired its members, 
interfered with its ability to file grievances and discriminated against 
workers who struck. Caterpillar contends the union is using the unfair-labor 
complaints to avoid reopening wage contract talks.

HOUSE PASSES NEW CREDIT REPORT LEGISLATION; CONSUMERS: THE BILL, WHICH GOES TO 
THE SENATE FOR FINAL OK, WOULD FORCE AGENCIES TO QUICKLY CORRECT FAULTY 
INFORMATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Legislation that would arm Americans with new power to correct inaccurate 
credit reports won House passage Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill shifts the burden of proof from consumers to credit-reporting 
companies in fighting a system in which lawmakers said erroneous information 
seems to never be deleted from computerized credit files. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the bill, consumers must be notified when action is taken against them 
because of information in their credit reports. Disputed information must be 
removed from credit files unless it can be verified within 30 days. 
</P>
<P>
 "If these reports are not accurate . . . then our whole society suffers," said 
Rep. Joseph P. Kennedy II (D-Mass.), chairman of the House Banking consumer 
subcommittee. "The promise of the information highway has given way to an 
Orwellian nightmare of erroneous and unknowingly disseminated credit reports," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure is a compromise between the House and Senate. The Senate must 
approve the compromise before it can be sent to President Clinton for his 
signature. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the measure, credit bureaus would be required to provide a free copy of 
a consumer's credit report within 60 days of an adverse action such as a loan 
denial and at the conclusion of an investigation into disputed information. 
</P>
<P>
 Consumers would also be able to get one copy a year of their reports for $3 
and additional copies for $8. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawmakers have been trying to enact credit reporting reform since 1989. The 
last effort, in 1992, fell apart over the issue of whether the new federal law 
should preempt tougher state laws. This bill preempts state laws for eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Esteban Torres (D-Calif.), who preceded Kennedy as chairman of the 
consumer subcommittee, said credit reports are the No. 1 topic of complaints 
before the Federal Trade Commission and that surveys show one in four to have 
some inaccuracy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The human consequences of these abuses can be devastating. Virtually every 
adult in America is at risk of falling victim to an industry that is out of 
control," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under another provision of the bill, furnishers of credit information such as 
merchants and banks would be given a chance to correct wrong information they 
provided to credit bureaus. After that, they would be subject to civil suits. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also requires employers and potential employers to obtain permission 
from employees or applicants before looking at their credit reports.

 AST to Drop Development of Subnotebook: AST Research Inc. said it is ending 
the development of its first subnotebook computer, which had been announced on 
Aug. 15 and was to be marketed this month.AST said the computer is a victim of 
the difficulties in the subnotebook market as well as of unspecified 
development delays. "The combination of the recent price cuts and slow 
subnotebook market growth prohibits us from competing in this market at the 
margin levels we need to sustain our high-volume, horizontal-focused business 
model," said Jim Schraith, president and chief operations officer of AST. Even 
with AST's moves, analysts are not counting out the subnotebooks, which are 
computers that weigh about three pounds.

 Eastern Announces Repayment Plan: More than five years after collapsing into 
bankruptcy, the airline announced a plan that would pay creditors pennies on 
the dollar and could help open the way for the carrier to fly again. Attorneys 
for Eastern Airlines, which came to typify the travails of the U.S. airline 
industry, boiled down $16 billion in initial claims and expect Eastern to 
ultimately pay between $1.36 billion and $1.45 billion to end the case."I am 
not 100% sure what the unions will do. But face it: There is no alternative to 
this plan," said Joel Zweibel, attorney for the creditors committee. A 
Bankruptcy Court judge will be asked to consider approving a disclosure 
statement outlining the settlement plan at a hearing Oct. 25 in New York.

BABY SUPERSTORE STOCK WEIGHS IN WITH 93% JUMP

<P>
 Shares of Baby Superstore Inc., dubbed "the Toys R Us of the baby industry" by 
one analyst, more than doubled in their first day of trading. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's shares soared 93% to $34.75 as investors embraced a company they 
believe is poised to capitalize on growing demand for baby products from 
parents who are more affluent but have less time to shop.  
</P>
<P>
 The shares traded as high as $38, an increase of 111% from the $18 that the 
initial public offering of about 2.7 million shares was priced at Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3.3 million shares changed hands on the Nasdaq, making it the 
10th-most active issue on U.S. markets. 
</P>
<P>
 "As the first superstore based on kids to have an IPO, there's an appetite for 
it," said Jean-Michel Valette, senior vice president of research at Hambrecht & 
Quist Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenville-based Baby Superstore is mimicking a strategy successfully employed 
in toys, home improvement, electronics and other product lines by so-called 
category-killer retailers. 
</P>
<P>
 The chain crams its shelves with cribs, baby strollers and other non-food 
products for youngsters. Most of its offerings are aimed at newborns and 
children up to 3 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 The company operates 41 superstores in 13 U.S. states, primarily in the 
Southeast and Midwest. It has opened three superstores in fiscal 1994 and plans 
to open about 12 more this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Its sales for fiscal 1994, which ended Jan. 26, jumped 68% to $104 million, 
from $63.1 million a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Each superstore has about 23,000 feet of selling space, dwarfing the specialty 
shops and baby departments of department stores. The retailer said it expects 
its future stores to measure 30,000 to 45,00 square feet. 
</P>
<P>
 Baby Superstore "is taking away what was a decentralized industry for baby 
products and housing it all under one roof," said Ted Goins, an analyst at 
Branch Cabell & Co. "It's a natural killer category." 
</P>
<P>
 "Baby Superstore is going to be the Toys R Us of the baby industry," said 
Claudia DeSimone, publisher of Juvenile Merchandising magazine, a unit of 
Columbia Communications.

FINANCIAL MARKETS; GOLD JUMPS, YIELDS HIT 2-YEAR HIGH 
</P>

 Financial markets showed a mixed response Tuesday to the Federal Reserve 
Board's decision to leave short-term interest rates alone, as long-term bond 
yields jumped, gold surged and stocks mostly shrugged. 
</P>
<P>
 In general, inflation jitters seemed to dominate, as some investors worried 
that the economy is strong enough to justify further braking via higher short 
rates. 
</P>
<P>
 That sentiment was most apparent in the bond market, where the yield on the 
30-year Treasury bond surged to a new 27-month high of 7.86% immediately after 
the Fed's meeting adjourned, from 7.79% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 By the close of trading the T-bond yield inched down slightly, to 7.84% -- 
still the highest since June 23, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodities trading, gold futures also responded quickly to the Fed's lack 
of action, with near-term futures leaping $3.70 to a 13-month high of $398 an 
ounce on the Comex. 
</P>
<P>
 Gold's strength came at the expense of the dollar, which was broadly lower. It 
closed in New York at 98.17 Japanese yen, down from 98.80 Monday, and at 1.543 
German marks, down from 1.554. 
</P>
<P>
 "The movement in gold directed things," said David de Rosa, a director at 
Swiss Bank Corp. in New York. "The gold market reacted to the Fed as if there 
will be higher rates of inflation. Bonds headed for the hills and that took the 
dollar down." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds and gold ignored a report that suggested possible economic weakness: The 
Conference Board reported its September consumer confidence index slipped to 
88.4 from 90.4 in August. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, the Dow Jones industrial average ended up 13.80 points at 
3,863.04, but its strength was concentrated in stocks of commodity producers -- 
which also pointed to expectations of higher inflation ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, losing stocks topped winners by 12 to 10 on the New York Stock 
Exchange in active trading, and broad market indexes were mixed. The Nasdaq 
composite index of mostly smaller stocks eased 0.26 point to 755.37. 
</P>
<P>
 The only major bright spot in the market was a sharp drop in short-term bond 
yields, which had surged last week, anticipating a Fed rate hike. The yield on 
three-month T-bills tumbled to 4.81% from 4.91% on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a Treasury auction Tuesday, the government sold new two-year notes at a top 
yield of 6.55%, about as expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Most economists had correctly predicted the Fed would refrain from pushing up 
interest rates for the sixth time this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the central bank's inaction doesn't rule out another rise in rates soon, 
said Michael Metz, analyst at Oppenheimer & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "The non-news is out now. But the probability is we will have a move by the 
Fed in the next month or so," Metz said, as more economic data is analyzed. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Dennis Jarrett, chief market analyst at Kidder, Peabody, said he 
expects stocks to rally in the near term. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think at this point the gold market is overbought, Treasuries are 
oversold," Jarrett said. "I wouldn't be surprised to see a rally develop in the 
other direction -- rally the bonds, sell the gold and get an equity bounce." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Tuesday's highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Commodity-related stocks rising strongly included International Paper, up 1 
3/8 to 79; Alcoa, up 1 3/4 to 87 1/8; and Union Carbide, up 5/8 to 34 5/8. 
Investors may be assuming that the economy will continue to roll without higher 
interest rates, allowing commodity producers to push prices higher. 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto-related stocks also got a bounce. Ford surged 1 1/4 to 27 7/8, Chrysler 
added 1 3/8 to 45 1/4 and Goodyear leaped 1 to 33 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Gold mining stocks got a boost from the rise in the metal. Newmont Mining 
gained 1 to 46 3/4, ASA shot up 1 3/4 to 53 3/4 and Santa Fe Pacific Gold added 
1/2 to 17 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Drug stocks surged, apparently helped by news that health care reform on 
Congress is dead for 1994. Merck jumped 1 1/8 to 36, Pfizer rocketed 1 3/8 to 
69 3/8 and Johnson & Johnson leaped 2 1/8 to 51 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among new stock issues, Baby Superstores surged to close at 34 3/4 on heavy 
Nasdaq volume on its first day of trading. The stock's initial price was 18, 
and it hit a high of 38 during the session. 
</P>
<P>
 * Nynex jumped 2 to 38 and was among the most heavily traded NYSE issues. The 
regional telephone company submitted a plan to state regulators today to cut 
basic rates in New York while freezing other higher rates for seven years. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the down side, some technology issues continued to weaken. Intel eased 
1/8 to 62 1/2, Compaq fell 3/4 to 33 3/8, Lotus lost 1 3/4 to 35 1/8 and 
Computer Associates was off 7/8 to 43 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, New Image Industries plunged 5 to 8 after Dentsply 
called off plans to buy New Image. 
</P>
<P>
 In the corporate bond market, prices of Greyhound bonds plummeted after the 
company said it would delay a $4.2-million interest payment. Greyhound Lines 
Inc. said it wanted time to develop a restructuring plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Tokyo shares took a big hit in end-of-quarter trading, as the Nikkei 
index tumbled 345.47 points, or 1.7%, to 19,468.89, lowest in five months. 
European markets were mixed, while in Mexico City the Bolsa index lost 21.65 
points to 2,818.43. 
</P>
<P>
 In other commodity trading, Comex silver futures for current delivery rose 9 
cents to $5.71 per troy ounce, following gold higher.

NORTHWEST TRIGGERS ANOTHER AIR FARE BATTLE; AIRLINES: RIVALS SAY THEY'LL MATCH 
THE CARRIER'S 2-FOR-1 OFFER. THE OFFER PUTS THE PRICE OF AN L.A.-NEW YORK ROUND 
TRIP FOR TWO AT $643.

 In the latest in a string of fall discounts, Northwest Airlines hatched a 
domestic 2-for-1 air fare sale Tuesday that cuts the price of a round-trip 
flight from Los Angeles to Chicago to $569 for two. The deal was matched by 
many major carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 The promotion, offering discounts of 50% for two people traveling together, 
are in line with a series of previous reductions this fall that have routinely 
cut the price of a round-trip ticket to the East to less than $400. Like the 
previous sales, the Northwest offer requires 14-day advance purchase and travel 
between Oct. 11 and Feb. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northwest deal would let two people fly from Los Angeles to Miami for $628 
and to New York for $643.  
</P>
<P>
 A round trip for two from Orange County's John Wayne Airport to Detroit would 
be $575. Tickets must be purchased by Friday, and lesser discounts are 
available for international travel. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal is not available during popular travel days near the Thanksgiving and 
Christmas holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Major airlines -- including American, USAir, Delta, Continental and America 
West -- said they would match the Northwest offer on routes in which the 
carriers compete. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, America West announced a new phase of its discounting with 
reductions of up to 52% to selected cities.  
</P>
<P>
 Travel agents said the newest discounts appear to be a response to consumers' 
expectations of lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are so many of these popping up one right after another," said Dianne 
LaPorte, vice president at World Travel in Santa Ana. "They are becoming the 
norm rather than the exception."

REGULATORS TAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS CONCERNS ABOUT BROKER CONFLICTS OF INTEREST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators took a series of steps Tuesday to address rising doubt that 
brokers and other financial advisers consistently act in their clients' best 
interests. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Washington, the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted new rules 
requiring disclosure to customers of how much a brokerage is paid to steer a 
stock order to a particular broker or dealer for execution. 
</P>
<P>
 The practice, known as payment for order flow, is controversial. Critics 
describe such payments as kickbacks from exchange floor specialists and others 
that prevent customers from getting the best possible price for their purchase 
or sale of securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC rule does not ban or restrict these payments; it merely requires firms 
to disclose a range of cash payments on a customer's annual statement, trade 
confirmation slips or new-account record. The rule will go into effect in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea is to let the customer see the otherwise hidden incentives that firms 
have to route their orders to a particular market and let him or her shop 
around for the best deal. 
</P>
<P>
 "It casts a light on a practice that a typical investor knows nothing about," 
SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt Jr. said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Steven M.H. Wallman, while saying he recognizes the potential for 
conflicts posed by the payments, pointed out that the payments may have spurred 
healthy competition among exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks listed on the New York Stock Exchange, for example, can be traded on 
regional exchanges, in the private "third market" or among firms. At least 15% 
of orders in listed stocks are routed according to payment for order flow 
arrangements, according to a recent Harvard Law Review article on the topic. 
</P>
<P>
 * The SEC also proposed a rule that would restrict Nasdaq dealers from trading 
ahead of their customers' limit orders. A limit order refers to a customer's 
desire to sell stock at a minimum price or buy stock for no more than a maximum 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 Trading ahead of a limit order can give a dealer an unfair advantage in 
knowing the direction of a stock's price. Many market experts say the practice 
puts the dealer's interests -- and profits -- ahead of a customer's. 
</P>
<P>
 The SEC's proposal, which will be open to comment for 60 days, would go 
further than a similar rule proposed last week by the National Assn. of 
Securities Dealers. The NASD proposal was more limited in that it would provide 
protection for small limit orders -- those for fewer than 1,000 shares -- but 
less protection for larger orders. 
</P>
<P>
 * In New York, Comptroller of the Currency Eugene Ludwig said bank employees 
who sell mutual funds will have to pass the same tests required for 
stockbrokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks got into the mutual fund business just a few years ago, and customers 
have complained about some bankers' sales tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Now thousands of bank employees will have to take eight-hour securities exams 
administered by the NASD. 
</P>
<P>
 Many salespeople at large banks have already passed the exams because they 
work for mutual fund marketing subsidiaries whose employees must be certified 
by the NASD. But bank employees at small and medium-sized financial 
institutions, which typically do not set up separate investment subsidiaries, 
have not taken the tests. These banks are regulated by Ludwig's office.

COMPUTER FILE / LAWRENCE J. MAGID: THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / 
INNOVATION; HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPONENTS, FALLING PRICES MAKE THIS A GOOD TIME 
TO BUY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE J. MAGID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you're thinking about buying a personal computer for your home, you've 
picked a good time. Prices over the next few weeks are expected to reach new 
lows as computer makers get ready for what looks to be a blockbuster holiday 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 About a third of American homes now have PCs, which means there are still 
plenty of potential first-time buyers, as well as those looking to replace 
older machines. 
</P>
<P>
 A key reason for the falling prices is the availability of lower-cost, 
high-performance components. Intel, which has defined the standard for 
IBM-compatible central processing unit chips, has come out with faster, more 
energy-efficient and less expensive versions of its Pentium chip (a CPU that 
can run up to twice as fast as the 66-megahertz 486 DX2, the leading CPU). 
Aggressive marketing of the Pentium has put downward pressure on 486 prices. 
</P>
<P>
 I've tested several Pentium-based machines and am now using a Dell XPS P90, 
which features the 90-MHz version of the Pentium. In terms of raw processing 
speed, it's twice as fast as my 66-MHz 486 system -- but that extra speed 
doesn't show up with most of the programs I run. If you're buying a new machine 
for typical business applications such as word processing, spreadsheets and 
communications, you'll save about $500 and still get excellent performance by 
getting a high-end 486 system instead of a Pentium machine. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you're going to buy a Pentium, I recommend the 90-MHz over the 60-MHz 
version. They are considerably faster and more energy-efficient. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, my kids and I do notice the Pentium's extra punch when we're using 
drawing and graphics programs and some multimedia CD-ROMs. It's been a big 
surprise to the PC industry that home computer users (like my kids) often need 
more power than office workers, especially if they're playing a lot of games. 
But I still think a 486, for most people, represents a better value. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep in mind that all 486 CPUs are not equal. Usually there's another number 
-- such as 33, 50 or 66 -- that indicates the CPU's speed in megahertz. The 
higher the better, but a small difference in speed (say 50 compared to 66) 
isn't a big deal. An SX after the number means there's no math co-processor, 
which usually isn't a problem unless you're a heavy spreadsheet user or plan to 
use computer-aided design software -- or want top performance on one of a 
handful of games that take advantage of the co-processor.  
</P>
<P>
 Some PCs have "Intel Inside" stickers showing there is an Intel-brand CPU. 
It's clever marketing, but don't be afraid of non-Intel CPUs, such as those 
from AMD and Cyrix. Major manufacturers, including Compaq and IBM, have found 
these CPUs to be reliable and compatible. 
</P>
<P>
 Apple is now shipping Power Macintosh machines with the Power PC CPU. These 
are very fast, but only if you're using software designed for this chip. Older 
Mac programs may actually run a little slower on the PowerMacs than on other 
models. If you buy an old-style Mac, be sure it's a model that can be upgraded 
to the Power PC. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The CPU isn't the only chip that helps determine a computer's speed. The 
amount of random access memory is very important. Many low-cost home systems 
come with four megabytes, but that's not enough if you want maximum performance 
with Windows or Macintosh software. You're much better off with eight or more 
megabytes: An extra four MB should add between $150 and $200 to the price of 
the machine. A large hard-disk drive is also important for home users. 
Graphics, sound and video files are much larger than the type of data files 
typically used by businesses, and some multimedia CD-ROMs copy several 
megabytes of information to your hard disk.  
</P>
<P>
 For your eyes' sake, be sure to get a good monitor. Never buy a color monitor 
that has a dot pitch greater than 0.28 millimeters. (The dot pitch is the 
distance between pixels -- the higher the number, the blurrier the image.) 
There is also the issue of interlaced and non-interlaced monitors. The latter 
are less likely to flicker, but they tend to be more expensive. Don't be 
seduced by a flashy in-store graphics demo: A poor monitor can be disastrous if 
you're working with text, so test the monitor by looking at normal-size text in 
a word-processing program such as Windows Write. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of home PCs come with a modem, but be sure to ask about its speed. Don't 
settle for a 2,400-bit-per-second modem now that 14,400 bps is available for 
less than $100. The faster modems make a very big difference when you're on 
line, and most 14,400-bps modems can also be used to send and receive faxes. 
You can now buy 28,800-bps modems for less than $200, but very few on-line 
services currently support that speed. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, make sure there's room to grow. If the machine doesn't have a CD-ROM 
player, be sure there's an "external drive bay" that will accommodate one. Also 
be sure to have at least two empty expansion slots in case you want to add a 
scanner or other peripheral. 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you have a PC guru in the family, you ought to buy from a company with 
a toll-free technical support line and a good warranty. I recently had a chance 
to test Dell and Compaq's 24-hour customer support and service and came away 
impressed.  
</P>
<P>
 You don't have to go to a big company for a well-made machine. Don't overlook 
no-name "clone" builders in your community -- but make sure they're reputable 
and able to stand behind what they sell. What to Look for in a Home PC 
</P>
<P>
 * CPU for standard PC (IBM-compatible): A 50-megahertz or 66-MHz 486 DX2 is 
fine for most users. Get the 75-MHz or 90-MHz Pentium if you're willing to pay 
about $500 for faster performance. 
</P>
<P>
 * CPU for Macintosh: A Power PC or 68040 that can be upgraded to Power PC 
</P>
<P>
 * Memory: Eight megabytes 
</P>
<P>
 * Monitor: A "dot pitch" of 0.28 millimeters or less; non-interlaced is better 
 
</P>
<P>
 * Hard disk: At least 200 megabytes; 400 or more is better. Look for an access 
time of 12 milliseconds or less. 
</P>
<P>
 * Modem: 14,400 bit-per-second with built-in fax capabilities  
</P>
<P>
 * Support: Buy from either a reputable local builder or a brand that offers 
toll-free technical support and a warranty, including overnight delivery of 
replacement parts. 
</P>
<P>
 * Extras: A double-speed CD-ROM drive and sound system

 Japan's Seiko Corp. and Seiko Epson Corp. have big plans for your wristwatch, 
car stereo, clocks, home appliances and cellular phone: They want to turn them 
into receivers for FM radio signals. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies recently announced plans to deploy a high-speed wireless 
communications network through a newly formed subsidiary, Seiko Communications. 
Called Active, the network system will transmit information such as personal 
paging messages, emergency notification broadcasts, news updates and local 
traffic reports worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The Active system is compatible with all national and international standards 
for FM frequencies and uses the existing infrastructure of radio stations. 
Seiko is already negotiating with potential partners in countries throughout 
the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the company has developed a small, low-cost receiver with low 
power consumption that it believes is ideal for building into mass-market 
products. 
</P>
<P>
 Seiko has been testing an FM system in the Pacific Northwest over the past two 
years that allows residents to receive a wide variety of information, from 
weather forecasts and local sports scores to winning lottery numbers and ski 
condition reports. The information is displayed on the system's first consumer 
product -- the Seiko MessageWatch. 
</P>
<P>
 Hold Still: Like small children, proteins are constantly in motion, twisting 
and turning, changing their shape and linking up with their neighbors. Thus, 
while scientists have been able to take snapshots of proteins, they have not 
been able to observe their motions directly. Direct observation is important 
because the movements of proteins -- the essential building blocks of life -- 
are critical to understanding how they work. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the Sept. 9 issue of the journal Science, a team of scientists at the 
University of California, Santa Barbara reported it was able to watch while the 
enzyme lysozyme -- part of the body's immune defenses -- attacked and disabled 
another molecule. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of probing proteins with light or electron beams, researchers used an 
instrument called an atomic force microscope. The microscope works like the arm 
of a record player, physically tracking the contours of a specimen with a tiny, 
highly sensitive needle. As the needle, whose tip measures only 20 billionths 
of a meter across, moves over a protein, its movements can be translated into 
real-time images. 
</P>
<P>
 My Aching Wrists: Carpal tunnel syndrome, a potentially debilitating injury 
involving the tendons that pass through a circular bone in the wrist, has 
received a lot of attention of late and is often associated with people who 
spend long hours working on computer keyboards. 
</P>
<P>
 Now researchers at Pennsylvania State University have developed a computer 
model to predict other occupations that carry high risks for carpal tunnel 
syndrome, which can cause severe pain and swelling in the wrists and arms. So 
far, the model has pinpointed poultry processing, meatpacking, cookie baking, 
carpet making, metal manufacturing and plastics molding. 
</P>
<P>
 Whereas research on carpal tunnel syndrome traditionally focused on personal 
and job attributes that may increase the likelihood of injury, the computer 
model zeroes in on the actual way in which the injury occurs. Pitting tendon 
strength against the stress applied to it, the model can predict both when the 
tendon will fail and the number of incidences of carpal tunnel syndrome for a 
given job. 
</P>
<P>
 The model has led to some interesting findings. Wrist extension was shown to 
be more dangerous than wrist flexion. And women were between two and 10 times 
more likely than men to suffer from carpal tunnel syndrome. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of that difference may be due to the fact that repetitive jobs are more 
likely to go to women than men, the researchers said. But the model showed that 
a woman's smaller wrist size resulted in greater stress on the tendon that 
passes through the carpal tunnel, or wrist canal. 
</P>
<P>
 The model is especially useful for industry because it requires only two 
relatively simple measurements -- grip force and wrist angle -- that can easily 
be collected at the job site. 
</P>
<P>
 Sooty Signatures: Everybody talks about air pollution, but nobody actually 
knows what all the sources are. Scientists at the Massachusetts Institute of 
Technology are zeroing in on one cause of pollution: soot. They are working on 
identifying the sources of soot based on its microscopic structure. It seems 
this structure is a function of the particle's oxidation and thermal history. 
</P>
<P>
 That means the soot particles from a diesel engine look different under the 
microscope than those from a factory smokestack.  
</P>
<P>
 By showing the relationship of soot microstructures to combustion conditions 
and fuel types, the scientists hope to put together a library of soot 
structures that can be used to show not only the sources of these carbon 
pollutants in the air, but also to identify specific types of fuel and 
conditions that lead to such emissions. This, in turn, would help engineers 
find ways to control the pollutants at their source.

THE CUTTING EDGE: COMPUTING / TECHNOLOGY / INNOVATION; INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES; 
GAME FIRMS BATTLE IN COURT

<P>
 Street Fighter, the martial arts hero who has propelled Capcom USA to the 
front ranks of the video game industry, doesn't seem like the kind of guy who 
would need to seek protection in a courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's where he'll be Dec. 5, when Capcom squares off against rival Data 
East USA in an unusual copyright infringement case that could establish legal 
precedents on the use of cultural and racial stereotypes. 
</P>
<P>
 Capcom, a subsidiary of Capcom Co. of Japan, sued Data East last year, 
contending that Data East's game Fighter's History was a rip-off of Street 
Fighter II, one of the best-selling video games ever. 
</P>
<P>
 Capcom said Fighter's History not only used strikingly similar characters and 
the same kind of hand, feet and projectile movements, but also employed the 
same joystick and button sequences to control the digital killers. Data East 
countered that the control sequences -- and, more important, stereotypes about 
martial arts fighters -- can't be copyrighted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Capcom is seeking a monopoly on one-on-one fight games," said William 
Fenwick, a Palo Alto attorney who is representing Data East. U.S. District 
Judge William H. Orrick, in refusing to grant an injunction against Data East 
last March, largely agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both games use moves common to martial arts, and they star stereotypical 
ruffians of the type who have battled each other since storytelling began.  
</P>
<P>
 Orrick said Capcom cannot claim such public ideas and expressions as its own. 
</P>
<P>
 "To do so would be commensurate to awarding Capcom a monopoly over a range of 
characters and moves that it did not create," Orrick wrote in an order last 
March.  
</P>
<P>
 "It would also allow Capcom to lay proprietary claim to all reality-based 
fight games featuring human characters," he wrote. Data East quickly sought 
dismissal. 
</P>
<P>
 But Orrick ruled in August that there were enough copyright-able "expressions" 
in the Street Fighter II characters to send the case to a jury.  
</P>
<P>
 Both sides agree that a jury is a dramatically different creature than a 
judge, and Capcom's effort to gain copyright protection on the entire look and 
feel of its game now stands a fighting chance. 
</P>
<P>
 If Capcom wins, other game and entertainment companies will be likely to seek 
copyright protection for stereotypical characters of one sort or another.

 If you need access to Internet resources but don't want to pay the $20 or so a 
month that most commercial providers charge, you might consider a local 
Freenet. 
</P>
<P>
 Freenets operate like large computer bulletin boards, providing access to 
information resources and offering e-mail.Currently there are 15 Freenets in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Los Angeles area, the local Freenet is based in Encino. You can enter 
some areas of the system for free. But a $10 annual fee is required if you want 
to send and receive e-mail through the Internet, post messages, use the chat 
area or access enhanced features. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the main goals of Freenets is to provide a user-friendly interface to 
popular Internet services. The L.A. Freenet uses a series of menus to help you 
select the data you want and provides access to a vast array of resources, 
covering everything from aikido dojos to mountain climbing.  
</P>
<P>
 To access the L.A. Freenet, set your modem software to 8 bits, no parity and 1 
stop bit -- the standard settings for reaching a BBS -- and have your computer 
dial (818) 776-5000. For further information, you can call L.A. Freenet at 
(818) 954-0080. ADAM S. BAUMAN

AST RESEARCH SCRAPS SALE OF SUBNOTEBOOKS; COMPUTERS: DELAYS IN DEVELOPMENT, 
COMPETITION CAUSE THE IRVINE COMPANY TO BACK OUT OF THE MARKET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROSS KERBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 AST Research Inc., which had planned to begin selling subnotebook computers 
this month, said Tuesday it has decided not to enter that market after all. 
</P>
<P>
 Subnotebooks are personal computers that weigh less than 4.5 pounds. In 
August, AST said it would begin shipping a subnotebook model this month, but 
none were sent out from the AST factory in Taiwan where the machines were to 
have been made. Company officials said Tuesday that development delays and 
competition in the personal computer industry caused the company to rethink its 
strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The combination of the recent price cuts and slow subnotebook market growth 
prohibits us from competing in this market," said Jim Schraith, AST's president 
and chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 William Milton, an analyst with investment company Brown Bros. Harriman in New 
York, said AST's move reflects an overall lack of growth in demand for 
subnotebooks, which typically lack full-size keyboards, monitors and other 
features offered with larger machines. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most subnotebooks, the model that AST had planned did not include a 
floppy disk drive, discouraging home users and others who don't already own 
another computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's disappointing for everybody, but the market's just not there," Milton 
said of worldwide subnotebook sales. "Potential users have just found that 
there are too many compromises." 
</P>
<P>
 Todd Bakar, an analyst at the San Francisco investment bank Hambrecht & Quist 
Inc., said he thinks AST will now focus on its notebook computers, which are 
more powerful. "They're not selling the subnotebook yet, so it's not like 
they're losing a revenue stream they were getting," Bakar said. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether subnotebook sales take off will depend on how soon manufacturers can 
incorporate the features of desktop personal computers, Bakar said.  
</P>
<P>
 "Long term, you will see a growth in the subnotebook market. But I think AST 
probably has some time before it needs to be there selling its machines," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Worldwide demand for subnotebook computers is likely to grow eventually, said 
Mike McGuire, an analyst with market research firm Dataquest in San Jose. And 
personal computer makers who neglect that segment of the market will do so at 
their own risk, he said. Dataquest projects that 1.1 million subnotebooks will 
be shipped worldwide this year, 2 million in 1995, 3.9 million in 1996 and 5.9 
million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 AST said earlier this month that product delays, parts shortages and lower 
profit margins will cause the company to post a loss for the current quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tuesday's Nasdaq trading, AST's stock fell 31.25 cents a share to close at 
$13.44.

KAWASAKI MOTORS OF IRVINE SIGNS MOTORCYCLE PACT WITH CHP 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kawasaki Motors Corp. U.S.A., continuing its long tradition with the 
California Highway Patrol, said Tuesday that the CHP has awarded the company a 
$2.1-million contract for 298 specially equipped motorcycles. 
</P>
<P>
 The contract is the largest motorcycle deal awarded by the CHP, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the new vehicles will replace older motorcycles that will be retired 
from the CHP's fleet of 422 motorcycles. The Irvine company will begin delivery 
this week and continue shipping through the end of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Kawasaki has won 15 of the last 19 CHP motorcycle contracts, bolstering its 
image both with bikers and law enforcement agencies across the country, said 
Bob Moffat, the company's vice president of sales. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1970s, Kawasaki motorcycles were used on the television series "CHiPs," 
and that exposure helped to make the vehicles popular with consumers, Moffat 
said. Law enforcement agencies also turned to the company, which now has 
contracts with 900 agencies in the United States and other countries. HOPE

SMALL VANGUARD PRESSES ITS CASE FOR JURY REFORMS; COURTS: PROPOSALS INCLUDE 
LETTING JURORS ASK QUESTIONS OF ATTORNEYS. CRITICS SAY IT UPSETS THE BALANCE OF 
THE SYSTEM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ten floors above this sunbaked city, five women and nine men take seats in 
Superior Court Judge B. Michael Dann's courtroom to decide a stranger's fate -- 
and become the latest unwitting guinea pigs in Dann's grand experiment in 
judicial reform. 
</P>
<P>
 Dann welcomes the jurors and then encourages them to do what many of his 
fellow judges think is the unthinkable. The jurors can ask questions not raised 
by attorneys by slipping Dann messages, and he even proposes that jurors be 
allowed to discuss their notes -- and the evidence -- as they go along. Before 
any testimony is heard, Dann gives each a printed copy of the jury instructions 
that clearly state what must be proved in the aggravated assault case, and 
reads them aloud. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he leads them in the first of many seventh-inning stretches. Grinning, 
the once-fidgety jurors stand in unison. For a moment, they look like they're 
doing the wave. 
</P>
<P>
 Dann's offbeat notion of how to run a trial has made many judicial colleagues 
exceedingly anxious since his "experiments" began four years ago. Some lawyers 
and prosecutors who come before him contend that he abuses his courtroom 
authority to upset the sacrosanct balance of the jury system. 
</P>
<P>
 Others disagree, so much so that Dann is in the vanguard of a small but 
growing number of legal experts who say there is a tremendous need for jury 
reform, from the beginning of the complex process to its often rancorous end. 
He is one of an even smaller minority, in that he has a courtroom in which to 
test-drive the reforms, and he does not hesitate to use it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury reform is rapidly gaining support in the wake of such highly publicized 
-- and much questioned -- verdicts as the acquittals in the first Rodney G. 
King beating case and hung juries in the Menendez brothers' murder trial. Many 
call for sweeping improvements, warning that the jury trial system could 
self-destruct without them, or peter out for lack of public participation. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some who scoff at the idea" of reform, said Los Angeles County 
Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti, who recently launched a task force like one Dann 
heads in Arizona. "But there are enormous questions, and enormous concerns." 
</P>
<P>
 Study upon study suggest that the jury process is inherently dysfunctional 
because of its insistence on passive jurors who cannot interact with each other 
or the judge and lawyers. That, reformists argue, flies in the face of modern 
understanding of how people process information and understand it. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors "are spoon-fed by lawyers and judges, and not all of what they get is 
digestible and understandable," Dann said. "And they are made to sit on their 
hands and keep their mouths shut." 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, studies and some experts argue, an alarming number of jurors do 
not comprehend the stupefying amount of evidence and the convoluted jury 
instructions thrown at them in many complex trials. Sometimes they come down on 
the wrong side of the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Responding to concerns that overly homogeneous juries are skewing verdicts, 
New York recently began using unemployment and welfare lists to broaden the 
jury pool, and Los Angeles is looking at similar measures. One in three jurors 
nationwide is impaneled under a "one day, one trial" system designed to lure 
more working professionals and low-income workers. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts, Colorado and Connecticut require employers to cover the first 
few days of service, and then the court pays $50 a day, even for the 
unemployed. Minnesota provides day care. And judges in Bellflower and Downey 
were cloaking criminal juries in anonymity so they could deliberate without 
fear of retribution until an appellate court ruled against them last week. 
</P>
<P>
 "These innovations, they need judicial supervision, but if they can be done, 
they would be wonderful," said G. Thomas Munsterman of the National Center for 
State Courts' Center for Jury Studies near Washington. "Examination is always 
healthy. I'd like to think it (jury system) is not so sacred that it can't be 
touched." 
</P>
<P>
 In the nettlesome area of judicial reform, however, much seems sacred. Little 
has changed since 1735, when one of the nation's first juries acquitted printer 
John Peter Zenger of sedition charges. That jury did not have the power to 
question or investigate, as earlier juries in England did, because lawyers had 
long before usurped that authority -- and have held onto it. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the legal Establishment like it that way, or at least tolerate it. 
</P>
<P>
 But why? 
</P>
<P>
 Former Chief Justice Warren Burger of the Supreme Court once encouraged judges 
to "stretch the mind" and embrace reform. Yet most are creatures of habit, who 
fear reform could lead to criticism by appellate courts, said U.S. District 
Judge William Schwarzer, who heads the Federal Judicial Center in Washington. 
"People are afraid of making changes out of fear they will introduce errors," 
said Schwarzer, a vocal proponent of reform. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Court of Appeals Judge Patricia McGowan says judges "are busy people" and 
should not be expected to lead reform efforts; lawyers respond that judges are 
often the only ones with the power to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Dann believes that lawyers enjoy adversarial trial battles in which they fight 
tooth and nail for their clients. They, and most judges, he says, covet their 
power and do not want to share it with juries. Worse, many worship the jury as 
an institution while harboring a deep distrust of the ability of jurors, Dann 
and others contend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an anomaly," Dann said during a break in the trial. "We trust them to 
decide life and death, but we don't trust them to take notes, ask questions and 
get the information they need to make the right decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, as he does this day, Dann makes sure his courtroom is not a 
battlefield between lawyer and prosecutor, but rather a classroom of sorts 
where jurors can think, communicate and learn. 
</P>
<P>
 All well and good, says University of Delaware psychology professor Valerie 
Hans. "The tightrope that you have to walk," she said, "is getting more active 
juries without going too far and allowing them to become inquisitors." 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles area professor and lawyer Franklin D. Strier writes in a new book 
that juries and judges should be given more authority, to counter "adversarial 
dirty tricks, witness coaching, discovery abuse and hardball tactics." 
</P>
<P>
 In Strier's 1988 survey, two-fifths of 3,800 Los Angeles jurors believed that 
attorneys were trying harder to distort or hide the facts than reveal them. 
</P>
<P>
 Every reform effort has its opponents. Even a change as seemingly innocuous as 
note-taking, which some judges allow, has critics who say it limits jurors' 
ability to observe the demeanor of witnesses and other signs of credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 Most reforms already implemented focus on pretrial issues, such as getting 
more diverse jurors to go along with the usual white retirees and government 
workers. Trial reform is far more rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it is taking place," University of Minnesota Law School Prof. Steven 
Penrod said, "it is happening in a piecemeal fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Munsterman's group, with help from Dann and others, will soon review reform 
efforts nationwide. They will look to Arizona, where Dann's committee of legal 
experts spent a year formulating reforms at the state Supreme Court's request. 
This month, the group unveiled a 56-point reform blueprint that incorporates 
Dann's methods. It also proposes child care and other juror perks, time limits 
on trials, better use of technology to help jurors recall exhibits and 
testimony, a juror "bill of rights" to ensure that jurors are treated with 
respect, and counseling for post-trial stress. 
</P>
<P>
 The group also recommends that juries not only receive interim trial summaries 
to help them remember but legal advice from the judge if they appear headed for 
a deadlock. 
</P>
<P>
 "One judge on the East Coast recently asked me just what the hell is going on 
out there in Phoenix," chuckled Superior Court Judge Barry Silverman, one of 
Dann's colleagues. "This is not avant-garde, crazy nonsense. It is common 
sense, logical stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 "When lay people hear this," he added, "they hit themselves on the head and 
say, 'Why haven't we been doing this stuff all along?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Task forces in Louisiana, Oregon, Minnesota and New York recently released 
similar reform-oriented studies, and there are several new books on the 
subject. Two years ago, the American Bar Assn. and the Brookings Institution 
convened a national symposium at which experts said reform efforts should 
target jurors' boredom, frustration, poor comprehension and confusion. 
</P>
<P>
 However, trying to inject innovation into the court system appears easier said 
than done. "Court reform," former New Jersey Supreme Court Justice Arthur T. 
Vanderbilt said 40 years ago, "is no sport for the short-winded or the faint of 
heart." 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't exaggerating. In 1930, a New York group proposed a long list of 
improvements. Trial lawyer Colleen McMahon says they are "still on the table." 
</P>
<P>
 McMahon, who chairs New York state's task force, likened the many current 
obstacles to reform to "the elephant that is standing in the middle of the 
room." 
</P>
<P>
 She warned that unless much progress is made, "there will not be enough 
jurors. It is that simple." 
</P>
<P>
 Small steps have been taken. In Fairfax County, Va., officials better prepare 
jurors by using cable TV to provide orientation. Phoenix and Los Angeles send 
prospective jurors a bar-coded badge that eliminates most paperwork. 
</P>
<P>
 And there have been some substantive changes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than half the states now go beyond the traditional voter rolls, using 
driver's license lists and other databases to get jurors. Many are trying to 
eliminate longstanding occupational exemptions for lawyers, doctors, 
firefighters, clergy and morticians who say they are too busy to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Florida, Colorado and other states and cities have converted to the one-day, 
one-trial system. Critics say two week jury service, such as that in Los 
Angeles County, is inefficient and boring, and scares away professionals. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics also contend that more needs to be done to prevent professional jury 
selection consultants from affecting trial outcomes. The U.S. Supreme Court 
prohibits removal of prospective jurors because of race or gender. In New 
Jersey, U.S. Court of Appeals Judge H. Lee Sarokin wants to bar all "peremptory 
strikes" (eliminating jury candidates without cause), contending that they are 
no longer a tool for ensuring fair juries. 
</P>
<P>
 Ways of splitting major trials into manageable parts and transferring some 
complicated civil trials from juries to judges are being examined. Other legal 
experts are calling for more Draconian measures, such as taking divorce cases, 
business disputes and drug trials out of the hands of juries. 
</P>
<P>
 New technologies are being used. In Los Angeles Superior Court Judge George 
Trammell's courtroom, computers can display documents, photos and graphics, and 
video cameras allow jurors to watch attorneys, witnesses and the judge. Jurors 
in the O.J. Simpson case will be able to view evidence on 67-inch-screen TVs. 
</P>
<P>
 Efforts to provide jury instructions, printed and in plain English, at the 
beginning or middle of the trial instead of at the end are multiplying. 
Garcetti is seeking a $60,000 federal grant to make all Los Angeles County jury 
instructions more understandable. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti, like his predecessor Robert Philibosian 10 years before him, 
believes that California may do well to look at jury systems in Oregon and 
Louisiana. Those states have long used non-unanimous juries in all but the most 
serious murder cases, with fewer hung juries as a result. And Garcetti supports 
legislation to temporarily bar jurors from making money off high-profile trials 
such as Simpson's. 
</P>
<P>
 There are myriad other suggestions: Sharply limit exemptions and hold trials 
at night to get more professionals on juries. Provide jurors with reference 
books so they can understand complex issues such as DNA testing. Upgrade jury 
rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Some, such as the Montana-based Fully Informed Jury Assn., are pushing 
controversial "jury nullification," in which jurors can essentially place their 
conscience above the law and acquit even defendants who broke a law. 
</P>
<P>
 Others argue for smaller juries, saying they save money. Opponents say 
shrinking juries would make them less representative and more prone to 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 While all these proposals are bandied about, Dann is using his courtroom to 
test many of them, without telling jurors how unusual they are until their work 
is done. Then he interviews them to see how it all worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Dann, 54, is an inveterate prankster with a schoolteacher wife, three grown 
children and a passion for Phoenix Suns basketball. Driving his Honda sedan, he 
is cautious, never challenging the speed limit. 
</P>
<P>
 But he is daring when it comes to the law. You cannot, he says, effect change 
if you are paralyzed by fear of reversal by a higher court or criticism from 
the legal Establishment. He laughs about a meeting not too long ago at which a 
bunch of judges "almost hooted me out of the room" when he brought up some 
reform ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 He is far from the most popular person in the Maricopa County Courthouse, even 
though several judges are trying some reforms. When court personnel gathered 
outside one recent noontime, they erupted into argument at the mere mention of 
his name. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's stupid, off the wall," snapped one former clerk of Dann's. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll defend the guy till the cows come home," countered a former bailiff, who 
said Dann's changes made jurors the best and happiest in the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Dann relishes causing such a judicial ruckus, and expects some opposition when 
the recommendations go before the Arizona Supreme Court, which will vote within 
six months on which ones to adopt. "In general, they are excellent," said Chief 
Justice Stanley Feldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent attorney Joseph Shaw, 82, believes reform is long overdue. To the 
judicial system, he says, "this was all like Catholicism -- you just didn't do 
certain things. But it ought to be done." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy County Atty. Michael Kemp was dead-set against the newfangled jury 
empowerments -- until he tried a few cases before Dann and won. "Now I'm all 
for it," he said. "In a rape case, a real ugly case, (jurors) asked some very 
good questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in a recent murder case posed a host of questions, including soliciting 
more information from a ballistics expert. "What kind of ammo used?" one note 
read. "How did (defendant) acquire the weapon?" "Can jurors see the gun?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dann said questions helped jurors arrive at a swift conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Back at the courtroom as jurors take a break, defense lawyer Greg Clark is 
growling about the question privilege; his client faces a year in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's stupid," he said, out of Dann's earshot. "If a lawyer can keep things 
out (of trial) and hoodwink his opponent, why would you then allow jurors to 
get around what you've so laboriously orchestrated? Why should we allow some 
juror to ask a question we don't know the answer to?" 
</P>
<P>
 Dann says that is precisely why jurors should be able to ask questions. Too 
many lawyers and prosecutors, he says, "hide the ball" and trick jurors, often 
with great success. 
</P>
<P>
 The recent trial is short and uneventful, and after Dann orders the two sides 
to negotiate a plea bargain, Clark's client pleads no contest and is given 
probation. None of the jurors asked any questions. Eight jurors later said they 
could not imagine why all juries do not have the same powers that they did. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we have the responsibility, why shouldn't we have the tools we need?" 
asked Eileen Sampanes, a health care professional. "If I was on the other side 
of that (defendant's) table, I would want the people sitting in judgment to 
have the same powers, the same ability. It makes it as fair as possible." About

</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County residents were asked whether certain changes in the jury 
system would improve it or make it worse. Three of the five 
recommendations--juries reaching a verdict by majority vote rather than the 
current unanimous vote, requiring jurors to have a minimum level of education 
and requiring that every jury reflect the racial, ethnic and gender 
distribution of the local population--all were supported by half or more of 
those polled. Other suggested reforms were far less popular. 
</P>
<P>

education? Would that improve the system, make it worse or have no effect?

 SOURCE: L.A. Times Poll interviewed 1,703 Los Angeles County adults, including 
1,038 residents who are eligible to serve on juries and 355 people who have 
served, Sept. 17 through 23. The margin of sampling error for the total sample 
and eligible jurors is plus or minus 3 percentage points. Around the World 
</P>
<P>
 No other developed country allows lay people as much power to decide civil 
disputes and criminal cases as the United States. Here is a look at legal 
systems in other countries: 
</P>
<P>
 ISRAEL 
</P>
<P>
 Most cases are tried by one judge, but murder and rape trials are handled by 
panels of three district court judges. Judges are chosen by a panel consisting 
of the Supreme Court president, two other Supreme Court judges, the justice 
minister, a lower court judge, two members of the Israel Bar Assn. and two 
members of the Knesset, Israel's parliament. The Supreme Court president also 
assigns judges to cases. Thus, unlike the U.S. system, the criminal defendant 
has almost no say in the process of choosing who will decide his case. 
</P>
<P>
 GREAT BRITAIN 
</P>
<P>
 Although Americans borrowed the jury system from England, the British rarely 
use juries for civil trials, except in libel cases. British juries decide 
criminal cases and usually must reach unanimous verdicts. If deliberations take 
longer than two hours, however, judges in London often accept a majority 
verdict. Jurors are selected at random from registered voters who are 18 to 70 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 BELGIUM 
</P>
<P>
 A 12-person jury is required for all capital cases. The system has been 
controversial because so few people are willing to serve. A furor erupted in 
Brussels last year when the trial of a notorious accused international gangster 
and killer had to be delayed for six months because of a lack of jurors. Jurors 
claimed to be ill, on vacation or too frightened of repercussions to serve. 
</P>
<P>
 GERMANY 
</P>
<P>
 Lay people serve with judges on panels to decide criminal cases. A majority 
vote is needed for a verdict. In serious crimes, judges make up the majority of 
the panel. Lay jurors make up the majority when cases involve minor offenses. 
Some German legal experts contend that the lay people are just window dressing, 
with the real power residing with the judges. Complaints about the system focus 
more on the judges and their competence than on the lay jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 CANADA 
</P>
<P>
 Judges can overturn a jury acquittal in a criminal case and freely comment to 
the jury on the evidence. Judges also decide most civil cases, although 
litigants can seek jury trials. Judges and defendants are given great 
discretion to decide how much of pretrial deliberations may be made public. A 
defendant, for instance, can ask, and is automatically granted, a prohibition 
against news reports of pretrial hearings. Reporters may observe courtroom 
proceedings but cannot report on them until after a jury is seated. 
</P>
<P>
 JAPAN 
</P>
<P>
 Judges have sole power to decide the outcome of trials. Without the need to 
worry about minimizing disruptions in jurors' lives, trials proceed slowly, 
often taking years before arguments are completed and verdicts are rendered. 
Although the judges are supposed to be impartial, scholars say they are 
influenced by a variety of pressures, such as organized public campaigns. 
Judges are widely believed to consider how their decisions might affect their 
chances for promotion.

BALTIC SEA FERRY SINKS; HUNDREDS FEARED DEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hundreds of people were feared drowned early today when an Estonian passenger 
ferry with 867 people aboard sank off southwest Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 "The number of victims will be many hundreds, I fear," Capt. Lt. Mikko 
Montonen at the Turku Sea Rescue Center told Reuters news service by telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 One survivor said the ship listed and sank within five minutes. The sinking 
occurred sometime after midnight. 
</P>
<P>
 Stormy seas and winds topping 56 m.p.h. were preventing rescue operations near 
the site of the disaster, about 23 miles from the Finnish island of Uto off the 
country's southwestern coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Montonen said about 30 people had been rescued from where the 15,566-ton 
passenger ferry Estonia sank while on its way from Tallinn, the Estonian 
capital, to Stockholm. There were 679 passengers and 188 crew members on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked to estimate how many could still be rescued, Montonen said: "At most, 
some tens of percent. . . . The conditions are terrible." 
</P>
<P>
 He said there were strong winds in the area, adding, "There are many lifeboats 
that have turned over, and people are hanging on to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Finnish radio said the weather conditions were worsening. Several passenger 
ferries and helicopters were helping rescue operations, and several more 
helicopters and planes were on their way from Sweden. 
</P>
<P>
 Montonen said the rescue was concentrated on finding people in the sea. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedish passenger ferry Mariella was one of the first vessels to arrive 
and was taking survivors on board. 
</P>
<P>
 Niklas Granrot, a Mariella crewman, said, "We have got our lifeboats in the 
water, and we're picking people up as fast as we can." 
</P>
<P>
 He said there was no trace of the Estonia, which was built in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so dark out there, all we can see are a few lights from lifeboats and 
emergency flares," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Per-Erik Cederqvist, identified by Finnish radio as head of information on the 
Mariella, said his vessel had picked up 12 people from the Estonia. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not believe that very many more alive will be found in that sea," he 
said. "The conditions are difficult. The sea is rough." 
</P>
<P>
 One survivor had told him that the Estonia sank very quickly, he said. "He 
said that all this happened within about five minutes. The ship listed over, 
then sank." 
</P>
<P>
 The Estonia had sent a distress signal that it was listing seriously and had a 
power blackout. 
</P>
<P>
 The cause of the accident was unknown. Cederqvist speculated that the 
Estonia's heavy cargo, including cars and other vehicles, might have shifted in 
the rough seas, causing it to capsize. 
</P>
<P>
 Five large passenger ferries and several merchant ships rushed to the scene to 
start rescue operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Swedish news agency TT said the Estonia had been expected in the Swedish 
capital at 10 a.m. today. The ship was partly owned by the Estonian state and 
partly owned by Swedish ship owner Nordstrom & Thulin.

WILSON ENDS CONTROVERSIAL STUDENT TESTING WITH VETO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL and CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Tuesday vetoed a bill that would have extended the life of 
California's heralded but problem-plagued student testing system, halting for 
now the state's controversial experiment in assessing what public 
schoolchildren know. 
</P>
<P>
 In his veto message, Wilson complained that the legislation to continue the 
California Learning Assessment System for another five years neither required 
that pupils receive individual test scores nor did a good job of measuring 
students' mastery of basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 He called on the Legislature, which reconvenes in January, to "give the 
highest priority" to enacting a new statewide testing program. Maureen DiMarco, 
the governor's education adviser and a candidate for state superintendent of 
public instruction in the Nov. 8 election, said new tests could be in place by 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 A broad array of education, business and other groups that had been pushing 
for an extension of the CLAS tests condemned the governor's veto, which was 
announced by DiMarco at a Capitol news conference. Some accused Wilson of 
caving in to conservative religious groups that had objected to the tone and 
content of the tests, which were designed to measure thinking and 
problem-solving skills. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of like throwing the baby out with the bathwater," said Karen 
Russell, who teaches eighth-grade science at Willis Warner Middle School in 
Westminster and represents much of Orange County on the California Teachers' 
Assn. board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 "It had its glitches, but we felt it was something worthy of trying to fix," 
Russell said. "The people who pay the bill need to be shown that we're doing 
the job. There's no way they can look at anything and say we've done any kind 
of job -- good, bad or indifferent -- if there's no accountability system." 
</P>
<P>
 Others also said the governor's action wasted the $50 million spent on 
developing and administering the 3-year-old program and leaves California 
without any statewide testing system as it grapples with ways to improve 
schools and student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed," said Jere Jacobs of the California Business 
Roundtable, a group of executives of large corporations who saw the CLAS tests 
as a key ingredient in efforts to improve schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a momentum here, we had the processes in place, and some corrective 
action already had been initiated," said Jacobs, a Pacific Telesis executive. 
". . . Now we need to pick up and work with the (state leaders) to develop a 
new system. We cannot have a system as important as public education without 
any mechanism for accountability and for understanding the performance of our 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, many Orange County educators praised the governor for halting the 
beleaguered testing system. Several people who have criticized CLAS for months, 
chiefly saying that it was poorly managed and that its architects had done a 
terrible job at selling it to the public, said they will focus on developing 
assessments for individual districts rather than rely on a statewide system. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking forward to districts having the ability to develop their own 
standardized tests," said James A. Fleming, superintendent of the Capistrano 
Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a state of this size and of this importance to not have any statewide way 
to assess the educational level of its students . . . is clearly not 
acceptable," Fleming said. "But if the purpose for assessment is to diagnose 
the educational achievement of a child or group of children so you can target 
instruction to those children, that is something that schools have done and 
will do." 
</P>
<P>
 But Debbie Hughes, a Saddleback Valley Unified trustee who often spoke out 
against CLAS, said Tuesday that she was "ecstatic" about the veto. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of parents have fought an uphill battle, and it's now come to fruition, 
at least for the time being," Hughes said. Accusing state officials of rushing 
to give the test before it was properly piloted and discussed with the public, 
Hughes called CLAS "a very expensive lesson" and said "we cannot afford to 
waste taxpayers' money on these huge experiments." 
</P>
<P>
 State Department of Education officials said the veto -- which took with it 
about $26 million for CLAS and such other statewide tests as the Golden State 
Exams for high school students -- will further delay the kind of assessment 
system the governor said he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 William D. Dawson, acting superintendent of public instruction, said DiMarco's 
contention that a new exam system could be developed in time for spring testing 
is "completely unrealistic." He also disputed her charge that the department 
"blew it" by not designing a system that conformed to the 1991 legislation 
authorizing development of CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 The veto follows a series of controversies over CLAS, which debuted last year 
and was praised nationally as a cutting-edge example of "performance based" 
testing, an important new tool in improving student achievement. Instead of 
filling in blanks or multiple-choice circles, students were asked to 
demonstrate how well they could think about material and solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
 They were asked to read passages from literature and write about what they 
read and relate it to their own experiences, or to solve math problems and 
explain how they found the solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, about 1 million public school students in fourth, eighth and 10th 
grades took the exams in reading, writing and mathematics. To save money, only 
some of the tests were graded and the results released in February were meant 
to gauge how the state, school districts and schools looked when compared to 
tough statewide standards. The giving of individual student marks was to have 
been phased in, beginning this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But problems surfaced almost immediately. Educators complained about 
mismanagement and problems with the scoring of the exams. Religious 
conservatives found some of the literary passages "anti-family" or an invasion 
of students' privacy and waged campaigns against the tests in the courts and 
their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a leader of one such group applauded the governor's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pushing for the veto; we're very pleased," said the Rev. Louis P. 
Sheldon of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition. "Wilson's turning 
out to be a great friend of ours." 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco denied that the veto was politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 The momentum of religious conservatives lost some steam when courts rejected 
legal challenges and the Education Department this summer released portions of 
the reading and writing tests. Meanwhile, a panel of experts asked by Dawson to 
review scoring methodology found serious problems and recommended that the 
giving of individual marks on the performance-based portions of the tests be 
delayed until scoring systems could be perfected. 
</P>
<P>
 Many parents throughout the state refused to let their children participate in 
the tests this spring because of all the controversy. The Fullerton School 
District was among a handful statewide that actually defied a state mandate to 
administer the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Supt. Duncan Johnson and school board President Robert C. Fisler 
both said Tuesday that while the governor's veto vindicated their district's 
boycott of CLAS, they are disappointed to see the test die. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a sadness to me that there's been so much effort and energy expended by 
so many people to turn out something that has no positive product that I'm 
aware of," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisler added, "Frankly, I'm sorry to hear this. We need tests that encourage 
thinking, and I think the CLAS test was a step forward in this regard. We want 
kids to think for themselves, not just learn by memorization." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), author of the original legislation, 
which was to expire this year, scrambled to address the various concerns in a 
new bill. In a statement released by his office Tuesday, Hart said he believed 
that the just-vetoed measure had met the governor's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that this veto will set back this state's momentum in education 
reform by wiping out the only effective tool we had to send a clear message to 
California teachers that problem-solving skills and effective communication 
abilities must be taught our students if they are prepared to compete in the 
fast-paced, highly competitive global economy of the future," said Hart, who is 
leaving the Legislature at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco said continuing to work with the CLAS system was "like trying to make 
an elephant fly." She had previously supported the testing system but recently 
made criticism of it a focus of her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), DiMarco's opponent in the race for 
state superintendent, said the veto represented "a victory of politics over 
policy. There's no other explanation for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin said she favored making further refinements rather than killing a 
testing system she considered worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
 "In private industry, you plan it, do it, check it, refine it. You don't throw 
it out and start all over again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Wilson's appointed State Board of Education recently urged him 
unanimously to sign the Hart legislation extending the testing system. On 
Tuesday, however, board President Marion McDowell sent the governor a letter 
saying she and her colleagues "understand, appreciate and respect" his reasons 
for the veto.

POLICE DISARMED BY HAITIAN MOBS; CARIBBEAN: ROVING BANDS STORM STATIONS IN 
COUNTRYSIDE AND TURN WEAPONS OVER TO U.S. TROOPS. SOME OFFICERS FLEE; OTHERS 
SEEK PROTECTION FROM AMERICANS.

<P>
 A nonviolent people's revolt is sweeping the northern Haitian countryside, and 
for the first time in years the hunter is being hunted. In revenge for 
oppression long wrought by local police, large roving bands of angry men and 
boys are taking it upon themselves to disarm the Haitian police in their own 
communities. 
</P>
<P>
 The mobs -- some with as many as 200 people -- are storming the police 
buildings and pillaging officers' homes, grabbing rifles, shotguns, handguns, 
knives, batons and ammunition and then marching proudly through the dusty 
streets and turning the weapons over to U.S. military authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The grass-roots movement has spread -- sometimes faster than the U.S. military 
can get there -- to towns such as Grande Riviere and Le Borgne in the northern 
valleys as people have become emboldened in the wake of the killings last 
weekend of 10 Haitian policemen in a gun battle with U.S. Marines. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, the people "liberated" Limbe, a town of 20,000. "Anybody who has 
repressed us, we are taking their guns," declared Jacques Fritz, who led a 
200-man mob Tuesday morning into the home of a local police section chief. 
"Anybody who beat us or whipped us, we are taking their guns. So when (exiled) 
President (Jean-Bertrand) Aristide gets back, the country will be clean." 
</P>
<P>
 But the reversal in Limbe and the other northern towns has brought chaos 
rather than instant freedom, wedging U.S. troops between demands by the crowds 
that police who surrender to U.S. troops be turned over to the people and 
police officers' pleas for American protection. The soldiers, brought here to 
keep the peace, find themselves unable to please everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "My brain is racked," said an exasperated Capt. Ed Barton, leader of a group 
of six Special Forces troops who have set up a base in the center of Limbe. "My 
job is to establish some sort of civil order around here. But we are starting 
at scratch, and everyone is turning to us for help." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Capt. Bruce Rahn, "Everybody thinks we are their own personal savior." 
</P>
<P>
 Life in Limbe began to turn upside down Sunday. A special detachment of 
Marines from nearby Cap Haitien, Haiti's second-largest city, landed by 
helicopter here in what was supposed to have been a get-acquainted meeting with 
local residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The Marines met with the police and confiscated most of their firearms, 
including semiautomatic and automatic weapons. When the troops flew back to Cap 
Haitien on Sunday night, they allowed the police to keep only a handful of 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "They left us with some pistols, and they said they would return," said Cpl. 
Ramon Cadet, a Haitian police officer here. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Marines are being phased out of Cap Haitien this week to make way for 
Army troops from the 10th Mountain Light Infantry Division, and it was the Army 
Special Forces who came to Limbe on Monday. They landed on the soccer field, 
townspeople swarming around the helicopters. The people then marched with the 
soldiers through the town, up to the open-air marketplace and into the Limbe 
police headquarters. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time Capt. Barton and his men strolled into the police building Monday, 
only three of the community's 20 policemen were still in town. The rest had 
scattered or gone into hiding. The three officers quickly turned themselves in 
to Barton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I put up my hands and surrendered," said Haitian police officer Parison 
Joseph. 
</P>
<P>
 Added Joseph's colleague Cadet: "By the time the Army got here, the people 
seemed no longer to tolerate us being here. They would no longer respect our 
authority. So we threw up our hands and surrendered to the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 The crowds grew throughout the day Monday. The people angrily told Barton how, 
before the Army arrived, the three police officers had fired their pistols into 
the air to keep the mob away. The crowd wanted Barton to hand over the 
officers. 
</P>
<P>
 The three policemen begged for protection. 
</P>
<P>
 Barton did nothing, deciding to let tempers cool overnight. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday morning, the rest of Limbe was emptied of police weapons as the 
crowds swept through various neighborhoods and converged on policemen's homes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the small, squat home of Papa Pierre, one of the police section chiefs who 
had fled Limbe, the mob poured in and rifled his belongings. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside, Pierre's 90-year-old mother, Yaya Pierre, was frightened by the 
uproar. Blind, gray-haired and nearly toothless, she shook her cane at the 
crowd. But she was no match for them; they pushed past her. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son doesn't live here anymore," she shouted. "Sometimes he comes to see 
us, but he doesn't live here anymore. He is the only son I have. My child! My 
child!" 
</P>
<P>
 Undeterred, the crowd turned and marched the two miles to the town square. 
Along the way they picked up another police rifle and a knife -- the last of 
the police weapons they believe were left in Limbe. 
</P>
<P>
 There, in a grand gesture of civic pride, they presented Pierre's hat and the 
weapons they had gathered to the U.S. troops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything will be a lot more peaceful if nobody has guns," said Pierre 
Jacquelin Alace as he handed over the booty. "Let the U.S. Army have the guns 
now."

JURORS MORE AVAILABLE THAN EXPECTED, ITO SAYS; SIMPSON CASE: JUDGE SEES SIGNS 
PANEL CAN BE CHOSEN QUICKLY. BUT SOME ANALYSTS FEAR OVEREAGERNESS, HIDDEN BIAS.

<P>
 On the second day of jury selection in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, the 
judge announced that so many people are willing to serve that he may not need 
to bring the full complement of potential jurors to the Downtown courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are running perhaps 25% to 30% higher (in jurors able to serve) than I had 
anticipated from my past experience with these cases," Superior Court Judge 
Lance A. Ito said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since jury selection began Monday, nearly 500 potential jurors have been 
screened. Of those, 222 are still in the running and will be coming back for 
further questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has said he hoped that from an initial outreach to 1,000 Los Angeles 
County residents, about 250 could be found who would be willing to serve on the 
Simpson jury. He indicated that the goal may be reached before Thursday, 
setting the stage for selection of the 12 jurors and eight alternates who will 
decide Simpson's fate. 
</P>
<P>
 The initial success at finding jurors who are willing to serve heartened Ito, 
but concerned some observers, who worried about too much enthusiasm in the jury 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's scary about these 'volunteer jurors,' the jurors who see this as the way 
to their 15 minutes of fame," said Los Angeles defense lawyer Marcia Morrisey, 
adding that some who have been called may now see jury service "as a way to 
change an otherwise dull life." 
</P>
<P>
 Other analysts warned that some prospective jurors who have voiced willingness 
to serve may have predispositions about the case or may be hoping to capitalize 
on it by selling their stories once the trial is concluded. A detailed 
questionnaire and further questioning by the judge and lawyers in the case are 
intended to weed out any of those people before a jury is impaneled. 
</P>
<P>
 Commenting on the willingness of large numbers of people to serve on the 
Simpson jury, Ito speculated Tuesday that unprecedented media coverage is 
responsible. "The hoopla factor goes up in direct ratio to the number of 
(television) microwave dishes outside," the judge said to attorneys in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson has attended both of the jury selection sessions so far, appearing in 
a white cardigan sweater Tuesday and, for the first time since his arrest June 
17, speaking briefly to reporters. Discussing a song he had been singing to 
himself the day before, Simpson explained: "It was (from the musical) 'Cats.' 
That song really gets to me because it says 'touch me' and I can't touch my 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 The football great has pleaded not guilty to charges of murdering his ex-wife, 
Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson's trial opened Monday with the screening of prospective jurors to 
determine how many had hardships that would keep them from serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about the impact of the case's enormous prominence on the jury 
selection process, Ito has devoted unusual time and attention to finding 
panelists qualified to serve, interviewing some prospective jurors individually 
and juggling other pressing issues to get the selection process under way. On 
Tuesday, Ito called jury selection "the biggest burden that has been placed on 
this court." 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, Ito decided Tuesday to postpone a scheduled hearing on 
several still-unresolved defense objections to police conduct during the 
service of search warrants. That hearing had been set for today, but instead is 
likely to take place next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito also has yet to say when he wants to hold a hearing to decide whether 
cameras should be banned from his courtroom for the duration of the trial, a 
move he threatened last week in response to a disputed KNBC-TV report about DNA 
tests. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Ito's clerk, the judge has not set a date for hearing that issue. 
On Thursday, he said he expected to conduct it this week, but he has not 
broached the subject since then. 
</P>
<P>
 With that issue still unresolved, Ito did pull the plug on a courthouse 
hallway camera Tuesday after a television station broadcast pictures of jurors 
in other cases milling about in the hall outside Ito's courtroom. Court rules 
prohibit the photographing of jurors, and the order allowing a camera to be 
present in the hallway during the Simpson hearings specifically bars the 
broadcast of photographs that show jurors in this case or any other. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerrianne Hayslett, a spokeswoman for the Superior Court, said there had been 
two instances in which photographs of jurors had been aired on television. The 
first was Friday, she said, and then on Monday night another juror from a case 
being tried near Ito's courtroom was shown so clearly that an acquaintance 
called to tell her that she had seen her on television. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge in that case protested to Ito, who barred the cameras immediately 
and does not intend to restore permission for the duration of the trial, 
Hayslett said. In addition to a television camera, still photographers were 
also ejected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing to get someone on camera," Hayslett said. "It's another thing 
not to edit it out." 
</P>
<P>
 As jury selection continued Tuesday afternoon, Ito and the attorneys for both 
sides resumed the laborious task of excusing people who cannot afford to serve 
as jurors in the Simpson trial. The judge has estimated that the trial could 
last until February. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has yet to rule on the prosecution's request that the jury in the Simpson 
case be fully sequestered for the length of the trial. On Tuesday, he indicated 
to some prospective jurors that they might be kept away from friends and family 
for the duration of the case, but also said he was considering limiting their 
sequestration to the period of jury deliberations. 
</P>
<P>
 In either case, jurors will not be able to go to work or spend their days at 
home for a minimum of several months. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of those who received jury summonses pleaded hardships of various kinds. 
The most common problems were employers who would not keep them on the payroll 
through the lengthy court proceedings and relatives who needed care. 
</P>
<P>
 But others insisted that they could serve no matter what. 
</P>
<P>
 One woman, who appeared to be in her 60s, entered the jury assembly room with 
a walker and had to be aided by deputies. When Ito questioned her, he asked 
whether she could endure what could be a long trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to make sure you are able to serve a proud duty," Ito told the 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can make it," she responded. She was then given a copy of the 75-page 
questionnaire that all prospective jurors are being asked to complete in order 
to help the judge and lawyers ferret out those who may have biases that would 
make it impossible for them to serve impartially. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the prospective jurors who gathered Monday, Tuesday's group groaned 
loudly when told that the questionnaire was 75 pages. It has taken many of the 
panelists hours to complete the forms. The questionnaires probe an array of 
sensitive topics and prospective jurors are not allowed to take them home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Go ahead and groan, and get it out of your system," Ito told the panelists 
who gathered in the Criminal Courts Building's jury assembly room. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito has asked prospective jurors to try to avoid reading or watching publicity 
about the case -- a formidable task in light of the extensive coverage given to 
it by print and broadcast outlets. Tuesday, when Ito reiterated that request to 
the prospective jurors, one laughed out loud. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see it on TV, switch to 'The Simpsons,' " Ito said, pausing when he 
realized his inadvertent reference to the defendant, who was present for the 
hearing. "The TV show, I mean," Ito added. 
</P>
<P>
 Ito and the parties in the case are scheduled to be back in court this morning 
to take up an issue that could determine the course of the Simpson trial, at 
least in the short run. He is expected to hear arguments on a motion in which 
prosecutors outline a novel approach to proceeding with jury selection in order 
to prevent what they fear will be certain contamination if the panel is chosen 
and then allowed to go home while the two sides wage a lengthy debate on DNA 
evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors are worried that the jury would hear that debate because it is 
likely to receive pervasive coverage. Once it is concluded, Ito would have to 
re-interview the panelists and dismiss any who had been tainted by the 
proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 "That some of those jurors would be deemed unfit, under the unprecedented 
circumstances of this case, is almost a foregone conclusion," prosecutors said 
in their motion, which was filed last week and unsealed Monday. "Thus, the 
likelihood of a mistrial is overwhelming. The jury process would have to begin 
anew and weeks of valuable court time will have gone to waste." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they recommend that Ito complete the current phase of questioning for 
potential hardships, then allow those several hundred prospective jurors to 
return home. Under the prosecution's proposed schedule, the whole panel would 
come back to court after the hearings, and a jury would be picked at that time. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnnie L. Cochran Jr., one of Simpson's lead attorneys, said late Tuesday 
that he and his colleagues plan to "vigorously challenge" that proposal in 
court today. 
</P>
<P>
 After the hearing on that issue, Ito and the attorneys are expected to return 
to jury selection, reviewing the next groups of prospective jurors to determine 
who may be able to serve. Today will be devoted to sifting through written 
responses to questions about hardships. When that is completed, oral 
questioning by the judge will resume and go on until Ito is satisfied that the 
panel is large enough for the next phase in the selection process.

 A look at some of the key events in the O.J. Simpson murder trial Tuesday: 
</P>
<P>
 * Summary: Jury selection continued as another 241 jurors were asked to report 
for questioning. After reviewing their responses to written questions, Judge 
Lance A. Ito identified more than 70 he said should be excused. Others were 
questioned about possible hardships, and some were allowed to fill out 
questionnaires and asked to return in early October for further questioning by 
the judge and lawyers.

WILSON'S VETO HALTS SCHOOL TESTING PROGRAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL and CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson on Tuesday vetoed a bill that would have extended the life of 
California's heralded but problem-plagued student testing system, halting for 
now the state's controversial experiment in assessing what public 
schoolchildren know. 
</P>
<P>
 In his veto message, Wilson complained that the legislation to continue the 
California Learning Assessment System for another five years neither required 
that pupils receive individual test scores nor did a good enough job of 
measuring students' mastery of basic skills. 
</P>
<P>
 He called on the Legislature, which reconvenes in January, to "give the 
highest priority" to enacting a new statewide testing program. Maureen DiMarco, 
the governor's education adviser and a candidate for state superintendent of 
public instruction in the Nov. 8 election, said new tests could be in place by 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 A broad array of education, business and other groups that had been pushing 
for an extension of the CLAS tests condemned the governor's veto, which was 
announced by DiMarco at a Capitol news conference. Some accused Wilson of 
caving in to conservative religious groups that had objected to the tone and 
content of the tests, which were designed to measure thinking and 
problem-solving skills. 
</P>
<P>
 Others said the governor's action wasted the $50 million spent on developing 
and administering the 3-year-old program and leaves California without any 
statewide testing system as it grapples with ways to improve schools and 
student achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very disappointed," said Jere Jacobs of the California Business 
Roundtable, a group of executives of large corporations who saw the CLAS tests 
as a key ingredient in efforts to improve schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a momentum here, we had the processes in place, and some corrective 
action already had been initiated," said Jacobs, a Pacific Telesis executive. 
". . . Now we need to pick up and work with the (state leaders) to develop a 
new system. We cannot have a system as important as public education without 
any mechanism for accountability and for understanding the performance of our 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 State Department of Education officials said the veto -- which took with it 
about $26 million for CLAS and such other statewide tests as the Golden State 
Exams for high school students -- will further delay the kind of assessment 
system the governor said he wanted. 
</P>
<P>
 William D. Dawson, acting superintendent of public instruction, said DiMarco's 
contention that a new exam system could be developed in time for spring testing 
is "completely unrealistic." He also disputed her charge that the department 
"blew it" by not designing a system that conformed to the 1991 legislation 
authorizing development of CLAS. 
</P>
<P>
 The veto follows a series of controversies over CLAS, which debuted last year 
and was praised nationally as a cutting-edge example of "performance based" 
testing, an important new tool in improving student achievement. Instead of 
filling in blanks or multiple-choice circles, students were asked to 
demonstrate how well they could think about material and solve problems. 
</P>
<P>
 They were asked to read passages from literature and write about what they 
read and relate it to their own experiences, or to solve math problems and 
explain how they found the solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, about 1 million public school students in fourth, eighth and 10th 
grades took the exams in reading, writing and mathematics. To save money, only 
some of the tests were graded and the results released in February were meant 
to gauge how the state, school districts and schools looked when compared to 
tough statewide standards. The giving of individual student marks was to have 
been phased in, beginning this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But problems surfaced almost immediately. Religious conservatives found some 
of the literary passages "anti-family" or an invasion of students' privacy and 
waged campaigns against the tests in the courts and their communities. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday, a leader of one such group applauded the governor's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were pushing for the veto; we're very pleased," said the Rev. Louis P. 
Sheldon of the Anaheim-based Traditional Values Coalition. "Wilson's turning 
out to be a great friend of ours." 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco denied that the veto was politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 The momentum of religious conservatives lost some steam when courts rejected 
legal challenges and the Education Department this summer released portions of 
the reading and writing tests. Meanwhile, a panel of experts asked by Dawson to 
review scoring methodology found serious problems and recommended that the 
giving of individual marks on the performance-based portions of the tests be 
delayed until scoring systems could be perfected. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Gary K. Hart (D-Santa Barbara), author of the original legislation, 
which was to expire this year, scrambled to address the various concerns in a 
new bill. In a statement released by his office Tuesday, Hart said he believed 
that the just-vetoed measure had met the governor's requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that this veto will set back this state's momentum in education 
reform by wiping out the only effective tool we had to send a clear message to 
California teachers that problem-solving skills and effective communication 
abilities must be taught our students if they are prepared to compete in the 
fast-paced, highly competitive global economy of the future," said Hart, who is 
leaving the Legislature at the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 DiMarco said continuing to work with the CLAS system was "like trying to make 
an elephant fly." She had previously supported the testing system but recently 
made criticism of it a focus of her campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Delaine Eastin (D-Fremont), DiMarco's opponent in the race for 
state superintendent, said the veto represented "a victory of politics over 
policy. There's no other explanation for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Eastin said she favored making further refinements rather than killing a 
testing system she considered worth saving. 
</P>
<P>
 "In private industry, you plan it, do it, check it, refine it. You don't throw 
it out and start all over again," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even Wilson's appointed State Board of Education recently urged him 
unanimously to sign the Hart legislation extending the testing system. On 
Tuesday, however, board President Marion McDowell sent the governor a letter 
saying she and her colleagues "understand, appreciate and respect" his reasons 
for the veto.

A LONG-BURIED OIL SPILL CASTS BEACH TOWN ADRIFT; POLLUTION: UNOCAL IS REMOVING 
TAINTED SOIL FROM AVILA BEACH, BUT BUSINESS DISTRICT MAY GO WITH IT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD C. PADDOCK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 All Mike Rudd wanted to do was build a commercial building in the heart of 
this quaint, dilapidated beach town. But when he struck oil, his hope of 
revitalizing the town was doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 Rudd, the owner of an Avila Beach bikini shop, discovered oil that had leaked 
for decades from Unocal Corp. pipelines running under the main street of town. 
As it turned out, more than 22,000 gallons of crude oil, diesel fuel and 
gasoline had quietly contaminated the soil and ground water beneath the 
business district of this seaside haven, eight miles south of San Luis Obispo. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal, whose hilltop tank farm looms over Avila Beach like a medieval castle, 
bought Rudd's land and began cleaning up the spill. The oil giant acknowledges 
responsibility for the spill, which it knew of as far back as 1977, but 
predicts that it will be at least five years and perhaps far longer before the 
mess under the town and its popular beach is finally cleaned up. 
</P>
<P>
 "They knew oil was seeping down here and they didn't say anything to anybody," 
Rudd said as he looked out on his old property, fenced and vacant. "The thing 
that makes me the most mad is they haven't done anything about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The spill has brought commercial development and real estate transactions to a 
virtual standstill because banks will not lend money on the contaminated 
property. Some townspeople worry that the spill may pose a health risk, 
although Unocal and health officials say there is no known danger. 
</P>
<P>
 Worse yet, complete decontamination confronts the town with perhaps the 
ultimate irony: Local merchants fear that the most thorough cleanup -- removal 
of the tainted soil -- could mean demolition of the four-block business 
district and the destruction of their livelihoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's basically killed the town is what it's done," said Jim Cumming, owner of 
the Avila Pizza Pantry, half a block from the beach. "The only way to clean it 
up is to dig up the whole town." 
</P>
<P>
 For Unocal, the contamination at Avila Beach is yet another black mark on its 
record of operations on the Central Coast. In March, the Los Angeles-based 
company disclosed that it was responsible for the largest oil spill in state 
history: as much as 8.5 million gallons of petroleum thinner that leaked into 
the ocean and ground water from pipes at its Guadalupe oil field, 15 miles 
south of Avila Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout California, state officials say, leaks from underground pipelines 
have come to pose a major oil pollution threat, causing spills on land, in 
creeks and rivers, and in the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big problem because what you've got is a very antiquated 
infrastructure of pipelines in California and they're not holding," said Steve 
Sawyer, an attorney with the state Office of Oil Spill Prevention and Response. 
"We're dealing with pipes that have been buried for 40 or 50 years. After a 
while, corrosion sets in and you get breaks." 
</P>
<P>
 Responsibility for monitoring more than 8,000 miles of buried petroleum 
pipelines is divided among various state agencies, and some leaks go undetected 
or unreported for years. State officials cannot say for sure how many pipeline 
breaks occur, but estimate that there are hundred of leaks, large and small, 
each year. 
</P>
<P>
 Just since January, 1993, more than 800,000 gallons of petroleum products have 
spilled from ruptured pipelines into such sensitive locations as the Santa 
Clara River near Valencia, McGrath Lake near Oxnard, School Canyon Creek in 
Ventura and Grapevine Creek near Ft. Tejon. 
</P>
<P>
 There also have been major pipeline breaks in residential areas, including a 
1989 gasoline leak that exploded and killed two people in San Bernardino and a 
1988 rupture that spilled more than 130,000 gallons of oil onto city streets in 
Encino and Sherman Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 This month, Gov. Pete Wilson signed a bill that would strengthen inspection 
and reporting requirements for underground pipelines. 
</P>
<P>
 State Resources Secretary Douglas Wheeler, concerned that the state's aging 
network of pipelines will lead to further catastrophes, said he will seek 
additional measures to improve spill prevention and emergency response to 
land-based oil spills. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a growing awareness of the seriousness of the environmental risk," 
Wheeler said. "We have only more of these incidents to expect. We have to be 
better equipped to predict them and, when they do occur, be better prepared to 
deal with the effects of a rupture." 
</P>
<P>
 The town of Avila Beach, with a population of just over 1,000, has long been 
dominated by the oil operations that surround it. 
</P>
<P>
 The tank farm on the hill above town is nearly a century old and was acquired 
by Unocal in 1906 -- in a card game, according to local legend. At the other 
end of town, the company built a pier where it loads and unloads petroleum 
products on tanker ships. 
</P>
<P>
 More than a dozen pipelines run under Front Street -- the main street of town 
-- from the pier to the tanks. Five of them are still active, pumping crude oil 
and refined products back and forth for storage and distribution. Other 
pipelines also deliver crude oil from the San Joaquin Valley to the huge tanks 
and to a refinery down the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early 1980s, Avila Beach was a bastion of resistance to construction of 
the Diablo Canyon nuclear power plant seven miles away. Now, residents ruefully 
note that they have become victims of fossil fuels, not atomic energy. 
</P>
<P>
 The town seems to be stuck in a 1950s time warp where strip malls and 
fast-food joints have yet to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 A few new houses have been built on the hill above town, but Front Street has 
hardly changed in four decades. One-story, flat-roofed buildings, separated by 
vacant lots, line one side of the street across from the wide sandy beach and 
fishing pier. 
</P>
<P>
 A chronic water shortage has allowed little growth, and the town's last 
commercial building was constructed in 1963. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one of the last, if not the last, unspoiled beach towns in California," 
said Nancy Argo, who runs a beachwear store on Front Street with her husband. 
"It's not Carmel. It's not Newport Beach. Time has stood still here." 
</P>
<P>
 Hoping to bring modest improvement to the commercial strip, the citizens of 
Avila Beach arranged last year to buy water from the state, ending years of a 
building moratorium. 
</P>
<P>
 They quickly learned, however, that oil contamination, not water shortages, 
would spoil growth plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Bray, a spokesman for Unocal, said it is difficult to determine when pipes 
under Front Street began leaking or even how much fluid seeped out. "It was 
leaking for some time," he said. "No one knows for sure how long." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bray said the breaks occurred before the mid-1970s, spilling an estimated 
15,000 gallons of diesel, 7,000 gallons of gasoline and an unknown amount of 
crude oil. The plume of contamination extends well under the beach and fishing 
pier, but apparently has not seeped into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem came to light in 1977, when petroleum fumes collected in the 
basement of a building on Front Street and exploded. At the time, Unocal fixed 
a pipeline leak and installed an underground wall to hold back future seepage 
but did not attempt to clean up contaminated soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "My understanding is that it was brought to our attention in 1977," Unocal 
spokeswoman Terry Covington said. "At that point, there was a barrier wall put 
in to protect Front Street from the contaminated area. Obviously, that wasn't 
sufficient." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until 1989, when Rudd began to develop his nearby property, that 
the problem resurfaced. This time, the extent of the contamination became 
public and Unocal promised to clean up the spill. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's a crying shame Unocal can do this to just ordinary people," Rudd 
said angrily. "I wouldn't buy a gallon of Union Oil gasoline if I was dying. I 
don't think anyone who comes to Avila Beach should ever buy another gallon of 
Union Oil gasoline." 
</P>
<P>
 Bray, however, noted that the company did not take action sooner because 
today's standards are much different from those of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 "At the time, no one thought there was a wider problem than the immediate leak 
at the site," he said. "Environmental laws and the way of doing business have 
changed a lot in the last 15 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Avoiding a potential lawsuit, Unocal bought Rudd's property for more than 
$500,000. Today, the choice land across from the fishing pier is empty except 
for wells that monitor the seepage. 
</P>
<P>
 Unocal officials say they have undertaken a long-term effort they believe can 
clean up the contamination without requiring the removal of any buildings or 
unduly disrupting the town. 
</P>
<P>
 The company installed a permanent vapor recovery pipeline under Front Street 
in 1992 to capture underground gases from the spill and pipe them up to the 
tank farm, where they are burned. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Unocal began a program of "bioremediation" -- aerating the soil 
so that bacteria naturally present in the ground would consume the spill at a 
faster rate. Bray estimated that the bioremediation will take at least until 
1999, and possibly much longer, to clean the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The oil company has also offered to guarantee loans for property owners who 
want to develop, refinance or sell their property, but no such transactions 
have been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, Unocal has quietly begun purchasing and leasing contaminated 
property on Front Street, including buying the well-known Avila Grocery and 
Deli. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the Regional Water Quality Control Board, which oversees the 
cleanup, say they were not notified of any spill at Avila Beach until 1989 and 
are not satisfied with the pace of the cleanup since that time. "There haven't 
been any aggressive methods of removal," said senior engineer Robert Baldridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this month, the board voted to set a cleanup standard for Avila Beach 
that is far stricter than the 100-parts-per-million threshold used until now by 
Unocal. In ground water, for example, the board set a limit of 1 part per 
billion for benzene and 1 part per million for total petroleum hydrocarbons. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyn Delany, chairwoman of the San Luis Obispo County Board of Supervisors, 
believes that tougher standard will compel Unocal to seek a more drastic 
solution -- decontaminating the town by excavating tons of tainted soil, up to 
15 feet deep. Most of the buildings that sit over the contamination could be 
saved, she said, but some might have to be destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think ultimately they're going to have to dig out the contaminated dirt and 
dispose of it properly, or clean it, and fill the town with clean dirt," the 
supervisor said. "Some of the buildings can be jacked up and held in place 
while they are removing the dirt and putting in new dirt. I think demolition 
would be a last resort." 
</P>
<P>
 Massive excavation, causing disruption of the entire commercial area and loss 
of business, is exactly what some residents fear will be needed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're going to have to clean it up and it's going to put me out of 
business. They're going to have to bulldoze," said Micki Sue Leister, who owns 
a beachwear shop and food concessions on Front Street. 
</P>
<P>
 The anger is widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a way of losing a lot of petroleum products and not telling 
anybody," said Cumming, who had hoped to build a small motel next to his pizza 
restaurant. "They've been working on (the cleanup) for five years and basically 
gotten nowhere. They're buying up the town but that's no solution to the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Others complain that word of the spill and frequent work by Unocal tearing up 
Front Street for the vapor recovery system have combined to hurt business. 
</P>
<P>
 "Avila Beach used to be a paradise," said Bill Price, owner of a Front Street 
beachwear store. "We don't have crime. We don't have stoplights. But we do have 
contamination." Slow Spill 
</P>
<P>
 Crude oil, diesel fuel and gasoline that leaked from Unocal Corp. pipes prior 
to the mid-1970s have saturated the soil under Avila Beach's main commercial 
street and its popular beach. This map shows the most contaminated areas.

COLUMN ONE; CRACKDOWN BY COLOR IN FRANCE; THE GOVERNMENT IS TARGETING 
DARK-SKINNED PEOPLE IN A HUNT FOR ISLAMIC TERRORISTS. BUT CRITICS ALSO LINK THE 
SWEEPS TO BIAS AGAINST AN IMMIGRANT GROUP THAT REFUSES TO GIVE UP ITS CULTURE. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Guy Andre Javitary, a 32-year-old construction worker, left his apartment at 2 
p.m. one recent day to look for jobs. By the time he returned early that 
evening, he had been stopped six times on the streets and strip-searched once 
by police. 
</P>
<P>
 Why did authorities single out this law-abiding French citizen for scrutiny? 
There's only one reason: Javitary has dark skin. And these days in France, 
people with dark skin are suspected of being Islamic fundamentalists and, 
hence, possible terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 In a massive crackdown, the conservative government has for a month been 
sweeping the streets, stopping as many as 3,000 motorists and pedestrians a day 
to interrogate them, demand their identity papers and, in some cases, search 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 With no apologies, the police are focusing on dark-skinned people. And the 
random checks, sharply criticized by human rights groups, reflect a deeper 
French antipathy toward Muslims who insist on maintaining their cultural and 
theological traditions rather than assimilating French values and culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the police see me, they just see a dark-skinned man, not a Frenchman," 
said Javitary, who was born in Martinique and who has been "controlled," as the 
police call it, dozens of times in recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 To protect himself these days, Javitary carries his passport, birth 
certificate, social security card and citizenship papers. But those documents 
didn't stop one police patrol from strip-searching him and then breaking apart 
the bead bracelets he was wearing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am trying to learn to tolerate it, but I will never understand it," 
Javitary said. "I don't know anything about politics or Islam. I'm a Catholic." 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Minister Charles Pasqua has strongly defended the hard line, citing 
la securite of France, a nation that has suffered many terrorist attacks. 
</P>
<P>
 At his urging, the government last year adopted laws to legalize 
stop-and-search campaigns and random identity checks to verify the papers of 
anyone whom police suspect of being a foreign national. Now police carry a 
laminated card, listing all the conditions under which they may "control" 
someone. 
</P>
<P>
 The stricter measures were used sparingly until August, when five French 
citizens were killed in Algeria by the Armed Islamic Group, which has claimed 
responsibility for the deaths of 17 French and 42 other foreigners there in the 
last year. 
</P>
<P>
 If a few innocent people are harassed or arrested in France, Pasqua says, that 
is the price his country must pay to protect itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to catch fish, you have to go fishing," he has said. 
</P>
<P>
 Public opinion polls suggest that most of France supports Pasqua. The 
67-year-old conservative's anti-Islamic crusade, and the capture of the 
fugitive known as Carlos the Jackal, has Pasqua being mentioned as a possible 
1995 presidential candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 The main targets of his crackdown are what government officials call the 
"Islamic menace," radical Islamic fundamentalists trying to undermine French 
support for Algeria's military government. 
</P>
<P>
 French law still prohibits racial or religious discrimination. But in this 
case, the police are checking everyone they suspect of being a North African 
Muslim, and most of them have dark skin. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, France has expelled more than 20 Algerian-born Islamic fundamentalists 
to Burkina Faso, one of France's closest allies in West Africa. Others are 
being held for expulsion, which has long been legal in France without a 
hearing, if the government deems it "an imperious necessity for state security 
and public safety." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the great ironies of France is that, as a matter of public policy, it 
has granted citizenship to so many immigrants over the years and at the same 
time insisted that the newcomers abandon their traditions and assimilate into 
French society. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in France refuse to recognize 'communities,' " Culture Minister Jacques 
Toubon said in a recent interview. "Unlike in the United States, France 
integrates individuals, not minority groups." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, those communities have taken root, especially in the poorer, 
working-class suburbs of North Africans that ring Paris, Marseilles, Lyon and 
other large cities. An attempt was made in the mid-1980s to culturally 
integrate those communities, but it failed. And yet, the battle continues. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent days, Education Minister Francois Bayrou ordered school principals 
to prohibit pupils wearing Islamic scarves from attending classes. Bayrou says 
the wearing of such scarves is a religious statement, which is considered 
disruptive to orderly school life. The government has not said whether wearing 
a cross, as many people in this mostly Catholic country do, would also be 
considered disruptive to school life. 
</P>
<P>
 In French society, being different is not considered a redeeming quality. 
</P>
<P>
 Denis Lacorne, a political analyst in Paris, says the conservative government, 
which took power in an overwhelming election victory 18 months ago, "is trying 
to redefine the French identity. They say Islam is a tradition and culture not 
compatible with French culture." 
</P>
<P>
 About 3 million Muslims, 500,000 of them French citizens, live in France, and 
most of them are immigrants or the sons and daughters of immigrants from former 
French colonies in North Africa. When they melded conveniently into French 
society, they were tolerated and even welcomed. But no longer. And new laws 
enacted last year make it more difficult for the French-born children of 
immigrants to obtain French citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, many Muslims are afraid to go to mosques out of fear of police 
harassment. And shops in predominantly Muslim areas close early to avoid 
conflict with the authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The crackdown has driven some moderate French Muslims into the radical camp. 
And Islamic religious leaders worry that the French are beginning to view every 
Muslim as a potential terrorist. 
</P>
<P>
 An official at a large Paris mosque has said he fears that it may already be 
too late to restore the "fragile consensus" that had begun to form between 
North African immigrants and French society. 
</P>
<P>
 That was clear enough for Ahmed Zitouni, an Algerian-born grocer arrested as a 
suspected Islamic terrorist a few weeks ago in northern France. 
</P>
<P>
 Zitouni is hardly a radical Muslim. Married to a Frenchwoman for 25 years and 
a resident for three decades, he has three children and a thriving shop. Not 
only that, but he chain-smokes, drinks beer and happily cuts pork for his 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities eventually released Zitouni but rearrested him later -- on an old 
drunk driving charge. He was convicted of the charge and sentenced to six 
months in prison. But authorities also plan to expel him as a suspected 
terrorist. His lawyer believes that Zitouni's drinking problem is his best 
defense against expulsion. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's totally unjust," complains Zitouni's wife, Martine. "Everyone around 
here knows very well that he is not political. But the police just don't want 
to admit they made a mistake. Now they're trying to shut him up." 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the government contends that the Islamic threat warrants 
extraordinary measures. 
</P>
<P>
 Pasqua has vowed to expel militants "by the planeload, if necessary," to 
prevent terrorist attacks on French soil. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I have to wait until bombs blow up in our country and kill French people?" 
Pasqua asked recently. "Or should I intervene ahead of time in order to 
dismantle the networks?" 
</P>
<P>
 The answer seems obvious enough to most here. In recent polls, 57% agree that 
repeated identity checks are "efficient and dissuasive." 
</P>
<P>
 Pasqua quickly sent the police to search for Islamic militants who he said 
were using French soil to plot further attacks. France also closed its three 
consulates in Algeria, making it nearly impossible for Algerians to emigrate to 
France. A centralized visa service was set up in western France, and the 
government declared that only "recommended" Algerians would be allowed to 
enter. 
</P>
<P>
 More than two dozen men, including Zitouni, were detained for two weeks 60 
miles northeast of Paris. Most were sympathizers, if not members, of the 
Islamic Salvation Front, or FIS, which opposes the Algerian military government 
but is considered less radical than the Armed Islamic Group. 
</P>
<P>
 None of those detained were directly linked to any terrorist activity in 
Algeria, however, and the government decided against returning them to Algeria, 
where they would have faced certain prison terms. 
</P>
<P>
 All but four were eventually expelled to Burkina Faso, where the French 
government reportedly is paying for their hotel rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, a few weeks ago, eight North Africans were arrested in four French 
cities and charged with ties to the terrorist organization responsible for 
killing two Spanish tourists in Morocco on Aug. 24. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has braced for terrorist reprisals on French soil, but so far 
nothing has happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet many in France well remember that the war of independence in Algeria, a 
former French colony, was fought for eight years in the streets of French 
cities as well as in North Africa before it ended in 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 The politics in Algeria are even more complex these days. About 6,000 people 
have been killed in violence there since January, 1992, when the military 
government scrapped elections as the Islamic Salvation Front was emerging as 
the winner. 
</P>
<P>
 The FIS and several other banned Islamic groups recently entered into talks 
with the military government after two leading radical figures were released 
from jail. (They remain under house arrest.) But the Armed Islamic Group has 
refused to take part. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacks on French people in Algeria reopened a cultural rift in France 
between immigrants who cling to Islamic traditions and the French, who fear 
that their culture is being undermined by everyone from Muslim holy men to 
Hollywood pitchmen. 
</P>
<P>
 With an unemployment rate of 12.6% in France, many see foreigners as a threat 
to their livelihood as well as their safety. And Islam, especially its 
fundamentalists, with their philosophy of obedience to theology over loyalty to 
secular laws, is a ready-made target for French politicians seeking favor with 
the unhappy populace. 
</P>
<P>
 Caught in the middle are dark-skinned French men and women, from North Africa, 
West Africa and the Caribbean. The police have only arrested a few dozen 
militants but have detained hundreds more immigrants for other irregularities. 
</P>
<P>
 The police checks, on the street and in the subways, have become a fact of 
life for people such as Javitary, a former sailor in the French marines and a 
son, grandson and great-grandson of French citizens. He has lived in France for 
14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The French desire to protect their culture strikes Javitary as odd. In 
Martinique, now officially a French "department," Javitary said, "we have 
already lost all our culture, everything is lost, because we live today like 
the French. Going to Martinique is like going to France. The same shops. The 
same products. The same fruits and vegetables. 
</P>
<P>
 "We used to have much in common with Africans," he added. "But the French have 
taken away our own culture. Yes, Martinique now is a little France." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than preventing trouble in France, he said, the police clampdown is 
creating a deep animosity among dark-skinned French. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is going to be an explosion," he said, "and it's going to be 
like dynamite."

GUNS-FOR-CASH PLAN RUNS UP AGAINST FEAR 
</P>

<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As dozens of U.S. Army helicopters saturated the Haitian capital at dawn 
Tuesday with loudspeaker advertisements in Creole -- "Bring your guns! No 
questions asked!" -- the U.S. intervention force launched a guns-for-money 
program aimed at peacefully disarming a nation awash with illegal assault 
rifles, machine guns and pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 By noon, it was clear this would take more than a day. 
</P>
<P>
 After several hours in tents on a broiling runway at Port-au-Prince's 
U.S.-held airport, the Army's makeshift arms bazaar had purchased the 
following: 
</P>
<P>
 * Two rusted Saturday night specials, one of which could fire a bullet. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two battered World War II-vintage carbine rifles, both carved up and 
corroded. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two turn-of-the-century revolvers, which an Army weapons expert pronounced 
more dangerous to the shooter than to his intended victim. 
</P>
<P>
 By day's end, the tally appeared meager: ancient pistols, six decades-old 
rifles and several hand grenades. 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem was not merely the Army's offering price -- roughly 
one-seventh the going rate on an open market fueled by uncertainty. It was also 
fear. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day at the U.S. Army's weapons-trading post, which will tour the 
city and the countryside in the days ahead, reflected the savage realities of 
life in the nation America is trying to tame. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got guns at home -- lots of guns -- but what happens if I sell them and 
next week another secret police groups forms and hunts me?" shouted Gregory 
Lubin, a former Haitian soldier among the thousands of onlookers who gathered 
and gawked all day, to the U.S. Army translator assigned to crowd control. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is there is some uncertainty in the community about the future," 
explained Army Maj. Keith Haas, a civil-affairs specialist on the scene who had 
worked with a highly successful guns-for-money program in Grenada after the 
U.S. invasion there. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is some reluctance right now to give up a weapon -- at any price." 
</P>
<P>
 So Army officers called the day's haul, which cost U.S. taxpayers about 
$2,000, a success by any measure. By the standard set just after dawn by Capt. 
Fred Dotson, the gun-buying program's chief architect, it was a resounding 
victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "One!" Capt. Dotson said firmly when asked how many weapons would make the 
day's work a success. "Any weapon we get off the street is one less weapon we 
have to deal with in other, less pleasant ways." 
</P>
<P>
 And, in fact, by the end of this first day there were heavier weapons gathered 
in the two Army tractor-trailers than the rusted 19th-Century pistols, which 
Army reserve Maj. Frederick Kraft, a Mill Valley resident and gun hobbyist, 
called "wall-hangers . . . not even collectors' items." 
</P>
<P>
 At least one of Haiti's dreaded paramilitary agents known as attaches -- a key 
target of the voluntary disarmament program -- did show up and quietly sell his 
Israeli-made Uzi submachine gun for the fixed price of $200. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview later near his home, the former Haitian soldier and 
professional assassin, who identified himself as Alexis Michelet, explained one 
of the more bizarre aspects of the instability surrounding the U.S. occupation 
in this impoverished and violent land. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fear at the moment resides with the Haitian soldiers and 
paramilitary agents who sowed it in the past. "This gun made me a target," 
Michelet said. "The people know who I am. If I kept the gun, the people would 
come to my house, kill me, burn my house and take my gun. I'm safer without 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 That is precisely what happened Sunday in the northern town of Cap Haitien, 
where Haitian army barracks, police stations and soldiers' homes were attacked 
and ransacked by mobs of angry supporters of ousted President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide. Many members of the Haitian military fear a similar fate awaits them. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one U.S. soldier at the makeshift arms bazaar Tuesday concurred. And 
by the end of the day, Pvt. Amos Brown, a Haitian American and 14-year U.S. 
Army veteran at the front line of the crowd-control operation, was something of 
an expert on the subject. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you what the people say. All of them said that if the American 
military doesn't disarm the Haitian army and the attaches , they'll do it 
themselves," said Brown, a naturalized American who left Haiti in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 A gentle man who has joked with and entertained the masses of Haitian 
onlookers since the first day U.S. forces landed, he said he wasn't surprised 
that so few of his former countrymen sold the Army their guns -- in a nation 
with an estimated 100,000 licensed firearms and an untold number of illegal 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is, what the people really want is total disarmament," he said. 
"But they want the Americans to do it. And they don't want to do anything with 
their own guns until they see what the Americans do first. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason why so many people are reluctant to turn their guns in is, of 
course, very simple. They're still very afraid." 
</P>
<P>
 Through his translation work in Haiti, Brown said he has come to understand 
this fear so well that "it is embarrassing to me, really, as a Haitian. These 
military people here, these attaches , if they see you with a woman and they 
like your woman, they put a gun in your face and take her. With their guns, 
they rob the people. If they like your necklace, they pull out a gun and rip it 
off your neck. This is the reality of life here." 
</P>
<P>
 Thus shopkeeper Dures Abraham conceded -- quietly and well away from the 
television cameras at the arms-trading post -- that it took a leap of faith for 
him to sell his .38-caliber revolver for $50 as one of the Army's first 
customers. True, the gun was made before the turn of the century. But Abraham, 
who said he had been robbed dozens of times before he bought the weapon on the 
street six months ago, said he had believed the rusty old pistol was the only 
thing standing between him and death. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, he said, it's only the American troops -- a fact several U.S. officers 
here said they understood. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a different situation than Grenada," said Haas, adding that his 
10-week weapons-buying program there brought in an average of 50 to 100 weapons 
a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Grenada, the people weren't really conditioned to force. They wanted to 
get rid of the weapons really badly," he said. "Here, there's a history of 
force and violence, and the situation is a lot more uncertain than it was in 
Grenada. If I was a person in an uncertain situation, I'm not sure I'd want to 
turn over a weapon either." 
</P>
<P>
 And Haas stressed that the guns-for-money program is just one of several 
contingency plans the Army has prepared for disarming Haiti's population. If it 
fails, he and senior military officers confirmed, there are more forceful 
options at hand.

EMBRYO RESEARCH BACKED BY FEDERAL HEALTH PANEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal advisory panel endorsed the controversial new scientific field of 
human embryo research Tuesday, saying it holds significant promise for medical 
advances, but proposed a strict framework for its conduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The research has generated growing ethical concerns because it deals with 
creating and manipulating human life. 
</P>
<P>
 While the human embryo "warrants serious moral consideration as a developing 
form of life, it does not have the same moral status as infants and children," 
the panel said in a report to the National Institutes of Health, which will 
study the report further before any guidelines are finalized. The report said 
embryos lack feeling and individual development, and "most other qualities 
considered relevant to the moral status of persons." It also cited the very 
high rate of natural mortality at that stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Many scientists believe that studying the human embryo -- at one week a 
cluster of cells no bigger than a period at the end of a sentence -- could 
yield infinite knowledge about some of mankind's worst medical problems, 
including genetic diseases, infertility and cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the work has been condemned by abortion foes, who view it as the 
destruction of human life. Rep. Robert K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove) has vowed to 
lead a congressional effort to derail federal funding for such research. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel's recommendations apply only to research conducted on human embryos 
that are created outside the uterus -- that is, embryos produced in a 
laboratory by mixing sperm and egg. The panel said that research should be 
limited "to the shortest time possible" and should not be allowed beyond 14 
days, which is considered a key transition time in the development of the 
embryo. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the point at which the "primitive streak" appears, an advancing line 
of cells that determines the embryo's head-tail, right-left orientation and 
indicates the beginning of the development of individual organs. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, an embryo is not regarded as a fetus until it is at least eight 
weeks old. 
</P>
<P>
 On the most controversial question -- whether embryos should be made solely 
for research purposes -- the panel condoned the practice only under two 
specific scientific conditions: "When the research by its very nature cannot 
otherwise be validly conducted" and when a "compelling" case can be made that 
it is necessary "for the validity of a study that is potentially of outstanding 
scientific and therapeutic value." 
</P>
<P>
 The advisory group acknowledged that the second category would likely warrant 
"special scrutiny" during the grant review process. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel was established last year by the NIH to grapple with the numerous 
ethical problems and to draft a blueprint to guide NIH's review of projects 
seeking federal funding. The report will undergo further study within NIH and 
be the subject of a public meeting in December. NIH Director Harold Varmus will 
make the final decision on guidelines to govern the work. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the guidelines will not apply to privately funded work, they are 
nevertheless expected to influence private research in that they will bring the 
entire field under public scrutiny and pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The American Fertility Society praised the report for its "cautious, balanced 
and sensitive parameters for research," saying that such research was 
"obviously . . . of grave importance," to its organization. Nevertheless, the 
society said it believes human embryos "should be treated with special respect 
and extreme sensitivity at every level of research." 
</P>
<P>
 But the American Life League called such research "immoral, unethical and 
evil," and said that it would "pursue every moral and ethical avenue that is 
open to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. William F. Colliton Jr., the league's director of medical affairs, said 
that the panel had "turned its back on God" and described the work as "Nazi 
Germany revisited," work that must be stopped. 
</P>
<P>
 The NIH panel explicitly recommended that research involving cloning, or 
"twinning," of embryos be prohibited. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, researchers at George Washington University Medical Center here 
caused an uproar after announcing that they had experimentally cloned human 
embryos -- that is, divided them into identical twins or triplets. Their 
experiment raised the specter that, since human embryos could be frozen and 
used later, parents could have a child and then, several years later, have that 
child's identical twin. Critics also raised the most extreme example of such 
work: that parents could have an identical twin years later to serve as an 
organ donor for the older child. 
</P>
<P>
 The response caused the researchers to announce that they would abandon any 
further attempts at cloning embryos. 
</P>
<P>
 The NIH advisory panel also recommended prohibiting research into human/animal 
combinations, implantation of human embryos into animals and any attempts to 
implant parthenotes, which are eggs that have been artificially stimulated with 
chemicals or electricity to begin developing in the absence of sperm. 
</P>
<P>
 But the panel concluded that research into the process of parthenogenesis may 
be valuable in understanding egg development. These so-called parthenotes die 
several days after they are generated and do not develop into real embryos. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel also sanctioned studying human embryos to gain advanced knowledge of 
potential genetic disorders but said such research should not be used for sex 
selection, except for sex-linked genetic diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel said that donors of gametes -- eggs and sperm -- or embryos must 
give informed consent with regard to the specific nature or purpose of the 
research being undertaken. The panel also said that gametes or embryos for 
research cannot be sold or purchased. 
</P>
<P>
 Most U.S. human embryo research has been an adjunct to in vitro fertilization 
-- helping infertile couples become parents. 
</P>
<P>
 But scientists believe that an increasing emphasis on such research will not 
only enhance the currently low success rates for IVF but also can provide new 
opportunities for understanding the mechanisms of cancer -- by studying the 
ways cells divide -- and the workings of genes. 
</P>
<P>
 Another potential benefit of human embryo research is as a source of cells 
that ultimately could serve as the basis for numerous therapies, such as bone 
marrow transplants, repair of spinal cord injuries or skin replacement.

1ST TO REJECT TEST, 2 HIGH DESERT BOARDS APPLAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tuesday was a day of vindication in the Acton-Agua Dulce Unified and Antelope 
Valley Union High school districts. 
</P>
<P>
 After months of controversy and court dates, board members from the two 
districts said Gov. Pete Wilson's veto of the CLAS legislation proved they were 
not "isolated extremists" and that students throughout the state will be better 
off without the controversial exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The two districts -- out of a half-dozen statewide -- refused to administer 
the tests last spring because the school boards believed the exams promoted 
anti-family values and invaded the students' privacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the people of the state of California have spoken," said Billy 
Pricer, president of the Antelope Valley high school district that was the 
first in the state to refuse to give the tests last April. "It was a poor 
example of a test. I think it's a tremendous decision by the governor today." 
</P>
<P>
 While most of the districts were ordered by the courts to give the tests 
before school ended last June, the Acton-Agua Dulce district never did 
administer it, officials said. "I think this was a very courageous decision on 
the governor's part," said Laurie Browing, the school board president. "I'm 
thrilled there will be some sensibility and that the program will be 
re-evaluated." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Antelope Valley Union Supt. Robert Girolamo: "I think it (the CLAS test) 
needs to go back to the drawing boards and get a better broad base (of support) 
from the community and the education experts." 
</P>
<P>
 Susie Lange, spokeswoman for the California Department of Education, said the 
critics are mistaking the governor's position and that the test will return -- 
but in a slightly different format. "I think they are misrepresenting what he 
did," Lange said. "The whole hysteria died down after people saw it wasn't the 
social engineering, family-torturing and mutilating that people thought." 
</P>
<P>
 The California Learning Assessment System tests, which were given statewide 
for the first time last spring, came under fire from parents and religious 
groups who believed the exams denigrated family values. Opponents launched 
vociferous attacks on the testing system, packing school board meetings in some 
districts and even filing lawsuits across the state to prevent students from 
taking the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 State education officials and some legislators, however, lauded the exams as 
revolutionary new measures of students' academic skills. After saying for 
months that the tests must be kept secret, the state released the tests 
publicly this summer to allay concerns about their content. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the state allowed districts to exempt students whose parents 
objected to the tests. 
</P>
<P>
 Several hundred parents in the Los Angeles Unified School District, the 
largest in the state, refused to allow their children to take the controversial 
tests. But the Los Angeles school board, which was sued by a group representing 
two San Fernando Valley parents, held firm in its support for the new tests 
after reviewing them in closed session. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very frustrated by the governor's performance throughout this 
controversy," said Mark Slavkin, the LAUSD board president. "It appears he's 
become hostage of an education agenda . . . by the religious right." 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Olenick, an Antelope Valley Union High School District board member who 
consistently voted against the board majority, said the exams became a 
political litmus test. 
</P>
<P>
 "It became a political football," Olenick said. "Pete Wilson would like to 
ingratiate himself with the conservative right. I think this was very, very 
shortsighted." 
</P>
<P>
 But to the CLAS critics, the governor's action was a courageous response to a 
testing system that left many parents questioning the public education system. 
Board members in Antelope Valley and Acton-Agua Dulce said they believed the 
tests asked too many open-ended questions and that answers were too subjective. 
The tests have few multiple-choice questions and allow students to write essays 
and share ideas and information. 
</P>
<P>
 "The system did not test students' skills," said Sue Stokka, a board member of 
the Antelope Valley Union High School District. "It represents a process that's 
really social engineering and that's not appropriate. It completely eliminated 
individuality and that's not American."

GSA'S JOHNSON PLEDGES TO FUND O.C. COURTHOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite Tuesday's vote in Congress denying $25.2 million needed to build 
Orange County's first federal courthouse, General Services Administrator Roger 
W. Johnson has pledged that he will find the money necessary to keep the 
long-awaited project on schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter made public Tuesday by Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.), Johnson 
assured the chairman of the Senate Treasury subcommittee, Sen. Dennis DeConcini 
(D-Ariz.), that "the Santa Ana courthouse project remains a top priority of the 
General Services Administration." 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that the appropriations bill now before Congress does not 
contain funds for the new courthouse to be named after Ronald Reagan, Johnson 
told DeConcini, "I am committed to proceeding with this project and to 
completing it within the agreed upon scope." 
</P>
<P>
 The former board chairman of Orange County-based Western Digital Corp. said 
that the "GSA will identify a source for the needed $25.2 million from within 
the authorized funding for the Federal Buildings Fund and will submit a 
reprogramming request for approval of Congress in a time frame that will permit 
us to maintain current contract award schedules." 
</P>
<P>
 Funds for the planned courthouse were "included in the President's budget," 
Johnson noted, but were cut by a House-Senate conference committee acting on 
instructions to cut "pork barrel" projects included in the budget by members of 
the Democratic majority. 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday morning, the House of Representatives voted 360 to 53 to approve 
the Treasury, Postal Service and General Government budget, after trimming 
appropriations for the GSA's Federal Buildings Fund from $736 million to $518 
million. Among the projects left without sufficient funds to begin construction 
were the planned federal courthouses in Santa Ana and Laredo, Tex., as well as 
a U.S. Geological Survey lab in Lakewood, Colo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate is expected to approve later this week the same budget the House 
passed. 
</P>
<P>
 The GSA has said that without full funding in hand it would be impossible for 
that agency to let any contracts for the courthouse and thus the project would 
have to be scaled back or delayed at least a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Until last week, things seemed to be moving smoothly toward a scheduled 1997 
completion of a 10-story courthouse building in the Santa Ana Civic Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Congress approved $103 million for the project, and excavation was 
scheduled to begin in January and construction in April. 
</P>
<P>
 But the remaining $25.2 million that was needed to have the project fully 
funded fell victim to Republican budget-cutters, including Rep. Robert K. 
Dornan (R-Garden Grove), in whose district the courthouse would be built. All 
of the other members of the Orange County congressional delegation likewise 
voted to slash $218 million from the Treasury budget. Dornan and Rep. 
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach) said they expected a House-Senate conference 
committee to simply eliminate more than $218 million in projects elsewhere that 
had been added to the public works list by the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 But when the conference committee met Thursday night to decide on the specific 
cuts, the Santa Ana courthouse was among the casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 When the measure was returned for Tuesday's vote, half of the Orange County 
delegation members switched their votes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cox and Reps. Ron Packard (R-San Clemente) and Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington 
Beach) voted against the bill containing the cuts, while Reps. Ed Royce 
(R-Fullerton), Jay Kim (R-Yorba Linda) and Dornan voted with the majority in 
favor. 
</P>
<P>
 Brian C. Keeter, Dornan's aide, said the congressman delivered an angry speech 
Tuesday on the House floor that criticized the conference committee's attack on 
the courthouse appropriation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Keeter said Dornan believed that for him to vote against the downsized 
appropriations bill after calling for budget cutting "would open him to 
criticism" by those who would charge that he was putting the interests of his 
district above the national interest. 
</P>
<P>
 By Tuesday evening GSA Administrator Johnson was being applauded for saving 
the courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is wonderful. Roger has always been a friend of Orange County," 
said Santa Ana City Councilman Miguel A. Pulido Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said she sent a letter to Johnson on Monday appealing for his 
assistance after the conference committee withdrew funding from construction 
projects in the districts of Congress members who had pressed for budget cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of last week's budget maneuvering, Feinstein blamed Dornan and 
Mike Huffington, a Republican challenger for her Senate seat who also favored 
the budget cut, for scuttling the courthouse. In retort, both said they were 
unaware that the courthouse had been in jeopardy. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein said Cox and Packard had asked her after last week's cut to try to 
save the courthouse project and she had approached both DeConcini and Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very pleased," she said of Johnson's letter. " . . . GSA can proceed 
with the building and there is no need for delay."

SEN. CALDERON FINED $15,000 FOR FUNDS MISUSE; ETHICS: STATE WATCHDOG AGENCY 
FINDS IMPROPER USE OF CAMPAIGN CHEST FOR SUCH THINGS AS TENNIS TOGS AND HIS 
SON'S BIRTHDAY PARTY. 
</P>

<P>
 The state's political watchdog agency has fined state Sen. Charles M. Calderon 
$15,000 for improperly dipping into his campaign treasury to pay for personal 
tennis togs, entertainment at his son's birthday party and his wife's modeling 
photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fair Political Practices Commission also levied the fine against the 
Whittier Democrat because in 1990 and 1991 he failed to properly report $32,000 
in payments made to a campaign consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 In documents released this week, the agency's staff said that Calderon, as a 
veteran lawmaker, "should have known of the reporting requirements and the 
personal use limitations" of the state's Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon, who is seeking reelection in November, was vacationing Tuesday and 
could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a settlement agreement released by the commission's executive director, 
Wayne Ordos, Calderon agreed to pay the $15,000 fine. The commission is 
expected to review the settlement at its Oct. 6 meeting. Calderon can pay the 
fine out of his campaign funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Under state law, "campaign funds shall not be used to make personal gifts 
unless the gift is directly related to a political, legislative or governmental 
purpose." 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 violations cited by the commission occurred in 1990 and 1991, when 
Calderon was sucessfully running for his Senate seat and later losing a bid for 
the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 In a summary of the case, the commission staff said that in January, 1990, 
Calderon inappropriately spent $298.90 on photographs for his then-wife, 
Jeannine. The onetime aspiring fashion model told the commission the pictures 
were "modeling photographs." 
</P>
<P>
 The following October, Calderon improperly paid $210 in campaign funds for a 
costumed Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle to appear at his son's birthday party, 
according to the case summary. 
</P>
<P>
 Two months later, in December, 1990, Calderon's campaign committee reported a 
$422.24 credit card purchase from Nordstrom listed as "gifts." The commission 
reported that Calderon said "he purchased a tennis outfit and tennis shoes for 
himself for a celebrity tennis tournament and purchased tennis shoes as a gift 
for a campaign contributor and organizer of the tennis event." 
</P>
<P>
 But the commission staff said the purchase was not directly related to a 
political, legislative or governmental purpose as required by the law. 
</P>
<P>
 Nine of the counts against Calderon revolve around his failure to properly 
disclose $32,000 in payments to campaign aide Yvette Rodriquez. 
</P>
<P>
 On state-required documents, Calderon disclosed that the money went to a 
consulting firm owned by his brother, Tom, according to Jeanette Turvill, a 
spokeswoman for the commission. Calderon should have reported the funds as 
going to Rodriquez, who was a subcontractor to the consulting firm, Turvill 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Calderon, 44, was elected to the Assembly in 1982.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / GOVERNOR; MISCUES HAVE BROWN ON THE DEFENSIVE; SHE 
PREMATURELY ANNOUNCES AN AGREEMENT TO DEBATE WILSON AND FINDS HERSELF IN AN 
EMBARRASSING SPOT OVER REMARKS ABOUT FELLOW DEMOCRATS AND THE DEATH PENALTY.

<P>
 The Kathleen Brown campaign prematurely announced agreement on a gubernatorial 
debate Tuesday as Brown herself scrambled to explain to fellow Democrats her 
statement that she had stood on principle on the death penalty while they had 
changed their positions for their own political advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democratic gubernatorial campaign issued a press release during the day 
declaring that Brown had signed a formal agreement to participate in a one-hour 
debate with Republican Gov. Pete Wilson to be broadcast statewide Oct. 16 from 
San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 The release proclaimed that "Wilson caves on debate demands." The text of the 
statement said that the Wilson campaign had abandoned two of its debate rules 
"after public outcry." 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Wilson campaign and television station KRON in San Francisco both 
said there was no agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Glaser, senior adviser to Brown, said a KRON official had indicated that 
Wilson had agreed to the proposed debate, co-sponsored by the San Francisco 
Chronicle, the Commonwealth Club and public television station KQED from 6 to 7 
p.m. on Oct. 16. 
</P>
<P>
 But Janette Gitler, KRON's director of local programming, said Tuesday evening 
that the announcement was premature. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can only say it's progressing," she said of the negotiations, which had 
been conducted secretly until now. "We're still negotiating." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Wilson campaign sought to keep Democrats buzzing among 
themselves by sending out faxes of Brown's quote on the death penalty taken 
from the Sept. 10 issue of National Journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown called the tactic political mischief but did not disavow the Journal 
quote, which said: "I could have done what every politician in California has 
done. I could have changed my position like Dianne Feinstein did and Barbara 
Boxer did and Leo McCarthy did and Mel Levine did and Willie Brown did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every single one of them changed their position to run for higher office. I 
couldn't do that the way I was raised. I was raised to believe that politics 
was also about principle and not just politics." 
</P>
<P>
 An aide to Sen. Feinstein, who is engaged in a fierce battle for reelection, 
reacted angrily to the comment and Brown issued a clarification saying: 
"Mistakenly, Dianne Feinstein was included among a list of political figures 
who have changed their position on the death penalty." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein supported the death penalty long before she ran for statewide 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked for comment after a luncheon address to the Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce, Brown told reporters: "The only point I was endeavoring to make is I 
did not change a position when it would have been politically advantageous to 
do so. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the Republicans trying to make mischief with their favorite 
hot-button political issue," she added.

<P>
 Brown is personally opposed to the death penalty but has said that if she is 
elected governor she will fully enforce the law. The Wilson campaign has 
repeatedly attempted to exploit her position, saying it is evidence that Wilson 
would be tougher on crime than Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was asked if she had had any problems with Feinstein or Sen. Boxer, who 
issued a statement late Tuesday saying she has favored the death penalty since 
"a series of horrifying murders" committed by the so-called Night Stalker in 
1985. Boxer did not run for statewide office until 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown said: "No, the only point was to speak to my own position and, again, I 
think it is somebody trying to make mischief." Political Scorecard 
</P>
<P>
 41 days to go before Californians go to the polls 
</P>
<P>
 THE GOVERNOR'S RACE 
</P>
<P>
 * What Happened Tuesday: Gov. Pete Wilson continued acting on bills sent to 
him by the Legislature, taking one brief timeout to visit a crew filming an 
episode of the television series "Dr. Quinn, Medicine Woman" in the Capitol. 
State Treasurer Kathleen Brown addressed a luncheon of the Hollywood Chamber of 
Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 * What's Ahead: Brown is scheduled to address supporters in Riverside this 
evening. Wilson will continue signing and vetoing bills in his Sacramento 
office. Of 1,216 awaiting action at the end of the legislative session Aug. 31, 
about 500 remain. The deadline for the governor to act on the bills is the end 
of the day Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A LIGHTER NOTE 
</P>
<P>
 After her luncheon speech in Hollywood on Tuesday, Kathleen Brown cited her 
astrological forecast printed in The Times on Sunday, her 49th birthday: 
"Repair work in October. You'll be on solid ground. Recent travel assignment 
bears fruit. . . . You are sensitive, psychic, seeker of perfection, spiritual, 
your own most severe critic. Participation in political, charitable activities 
highlighted this year. You'll be asked to prepare written summary in November. 
Popularity moves upward."

ON CALIFORNIA: A GOOD TIME WAS HAD BY ALL, ALMOST

 No television cameras jostled for position at the Ascension Cemetery on 
Monday. No morning disc jockeys came with jugglers to broadcast live from the 
site. No performance artist painted himself blood red. Nobody hawked O.J. 
buttons. There was no press pool. There was no press. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene could not be described as a circus or a zoo. The mood was not 
festive. This was not the center of the media universe, a phrase repeated again 
and again in the reports from a courthouse 45 miles north in Downtown Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-five miles north, people stopped on the sidewalk and stared in wonder at 
the giant scaffold the city erected to serve the network anchors. One was 
adorned with a clever sign: "Brokaw's Butte." Forty-five miles north, they 
stood in the courthouse hallways and told and retold the O.J. knock-knock joke. 
</P>
<P>
 "Knock, knock." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who's there?" 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J." 
</P>
<P>
 "O.J. who?" 
</P>
<P>
 "You just qualified for the jury." 
</P>
<P>
 It was surprising that this joke still got laughs, but it did Monday, in the 
courthouse where the "celebrated" -- to borrow an adjective from the news 
accounts -- trial of O.J. Simpson began. Nobody was laughing here. Nobody was 
celebrating. "This," the cemetery caretaker said simply, "is reality." This is 
where Nicole Brown Simpson is buried. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The cemetery is a small one. It backs up against a tract of look-alike stucco 
houses. The neighborhood crawls with kids. It seems neat and safe and 
quintessentially Orange County. Nicole Brown Simpson grew up not far from here, 
in a neighborhood not unlike this one. She left as a teen-ager to take a job in 
Beverly Hills, where she met a football legend and fell in love. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the football legend sat in a courtroom and studied the faces of 
potential jurors. Twelve of them eventually will decide if he murdered Nicole 
Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. It is a question that drives conversation 
everywhere. If not O.J., then who? If not out of jealous rage, then why? 
Everyone has a theory, some piece of wit and wisdom to pass along. Everyone 
plays the game, trading their pearls like the mountain men once bartered pelts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Brown Simpson, of course, is not allowed to partake in this new 
pastime. There is some obvious irony in this, for she most likely could answer 
with certainty the riddles that have brought everyone under the circus tent. So 
could Ronald Goldman. For an awful minute or two, he must have known 
"whodunit." Unfortunately, he can't get into the game either. 
</P>
<P>
 So the questions must be taken into a courtroom. The nation of television has 
converged again on Los Angeles, ready to watch the trial with unblinking 
fascination. Soon will come the revelations. Soon will come the chance to play 
along with the jury, to solve the riddle. What fun. What entertainment. What a 
circus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked God about O.J.," said the performance artist who came to the 
courthouse Monday and painted himself red. "God said he's innocent, that two 
other people did it." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why don't you go back," said a reporter in response, "and ask God tonight 
what their names are and come back tomorrow and tell us?" 
</P>
<P>
 And everyone laughed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The pool reporters said Simpson sipped a Coke during the proceedings. They 
said he appeared "upbeat." He even sang a little song, something about "a new 
day." Here at the Ascension Cemetery, of course, there was no singing. There is 
nothing so quiet as a cemetery, and to come here directly from Downtown Los 
Angeles made it seem by contrast quieter still. 
</P>
<P>
 The Simpson case turned the corner from tragedy to burlesque a long time ago, 
probably with the Friday night Bronco tour. It since has gotten only weirder 
and noisier and less and less real. There are reasons for this, and they 
probably could not be avoided. Here, though, is one place where the fever can 
be broken. Here, as the caretaker said, is "reality." 
</P>
<P>
 He would give only general directions. The family, he said, doesn't want 
strangers at her grave -- about the only intimacy anyone's been able to salvage 
for this woman. There were, however, only a couple of unmarked grave sites. One 
was adorned with white gladioluses, the other with fresh pink roses. On both, 
the grass was fairly new and crawling with red ants. In the end, which one was 
hers didn't matter. Graves are all pretty much the same, which is the ultimate 
moral of cemeteries. 
</P>
<P>
 No, it was simply enough to come here and experience the quiet, to stare down 
at the still settling earth and remember that -- however this Simpson story 
ends -- the beginning involved the violent taking of two young lives. Nothing 
funny about that, nothing clever, and before Monday it seemed a point too 
obvious to even mention.

JOAN IRVINE SMITH SON CHOOSES LOVE OVER FAMILY TIES; RELATIONSHIPS: MARRIAGE TO 
A WOMAN OF WHOM HIS MOTHER DISAPPROVES MAY COST MORTON SMITH AN INHERITANCE OF 
UP TO $100 MILLION. BUT IN HIS HEART, HE SAYS, HE DID THE RIGHT THING.

<P>
 Forced to choose between his millionaire mother and his college sweetheart, 
the youngest son of Orange County heiress Joan Irvine Smith picked love over 
money earlier this month, marrying a woman his family disapproved of despite 
threats that he would be disowned. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a choice that could cost him an inheritance of as much as $100 million 
-- but spared him his dignity, Morton Smith said. It also has pitted him 
against one of Orange County's wealthiest and most visible philanthropists. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week, the delicate details of the Huntington Beach wedding -- which 
Smith's parents and two brothers missed -- were spread across a full page of 
the National Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think anybody should have to be forced to choose between individuals 
and their family," the younger Smith said in an interview earlier this week, 
recounting his mother's warnings that if he married Marianne Campbell -- an 
independent-minded nurse with working-class roots -- he would be "out of the 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 "I always felt that people who didn't take a chance on something they believed 
in were losers," added the 29-year-old securities broker, who settled in 
Huntington Beach with his bride after returning from a honeymoon in western 
Canada. "I did the right thing as far as my heart told me." 
</P>
<P>
 The elder Smith, 61, granddaughter of the man who once owned much of Orange 
County, refused interviews because she was ill. Through her attorney, Russ 
Allen, she declined comment on whether Morton had been removed from her will. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could not encourage this marriage," said the renowned art maven and 
horsewoman in a statement provided by her attorney. "And I fear that it may 
provide a continuing cause of estrangement of Morton from the rest of our 
family." 
</P>
<P>
 In her statement, Smith condemned the Enquirer story as "sensationalistic, 
overdrawn and distorted," and bitterly compared its veracity to "the periodic 
rumors that 'Elvis lives.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Irvine Smith has given millions to UC Irvine, and recently opened her own 
museum displaying California Impressionist paintings. Each spring, she plays 
host to the Oaks Classic, a horse-jumping competition and charity fund-raiser 
at her San Juan Capistrano ranch. Several years ago, she successfully sued the 
Irvine Co. for about $250 million, landing her family among the richest in the 
nation, according to a 1993 Forbes magazine survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Morton Smith and others have estimated his mother's fortune at about $500 
million. Allen would not comment Monday on the provisions of his client's will 
or how she might divide her wealth among her three children and charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell, 30, a pediatric oncology nurse at Long Beach Memorial Medical 
Center, said she is most saddened by the broken relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame because they have a wonderful family, an incredible legacy," she 
said. "Mrs. Smith is brilliant. I just wish she could be more of a mom to him. 
I think sometimes she tries to control people. She can't control me because I 
can't be bought. I won't be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not want any bit of their inheritance; I have my own life," she added. 
"To deny your son -- I can't think of anything more tragic than that." 
</P>
<P>
 The newlyweds both said they hope the rift can be bridged. Still hoping to 
celebrate Christmas with his family, Morton Smith said: "I don't even care if I 
don't get a present, I'd just like a slice of turkey and I'd like to sit at the 
table." 
</P>
<P>
 After a 10-year courtship that began in college, Morton and Marianne were wed 
at the altar at St. Mary's Church in Huntington Beach on Sept. 16. A sunset 
reception on the beach at Irvine Cove was attended by about 100 guests. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Irvine Smith was absent (she said she never got an invitation, though the 
couple said they sent one). Also skipping the nuptials were Morton's father, 
Morton Cappy Smith, and two half-brothers, James Swinden and Russell Penniman. 
Marianne's parents, Antoinette and James Campbell, did attend, along with 
Morton's half-sister, Alletta Cooper, and reporters and photographers from the 
Enquirer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Marianne's a fine girl, she's well educated and she conducts herself very 
well," said James Campbell, a retired salesman. "I don't know what social class 
is, to tell you the truth. She has good morals and she's a very good girl." 
</P>
<P>
 Morton and Marianne met when both were undergraduates at the University of 
Rhode Island. She had admired him, a handsome lacrosse player, from across 
crowded rooms many times; finally, friends set them up. It was much later that 
she learned of his pedigree. 
</P>
<P>
 The seventh of nine children in an Italian-American Catholic clan, Campbell 
grew up in Wilmington, a working-class suburb of Boston. She moved to 
California in 1987, a year after graduation from URI, to attend Pepperdine 
University, where she earned a master's degree in clinical psychology. Smith 
spent time abroad, graduated from URI in 1988, and then settled here to be 
closer to Campbell and to his family. 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell recalled that her relationship with her mother-in-law was rocky from 
the start. 
</P>
<P>
 The day after the two women met about seven years ago, Campbell said, Joan 
Irvine Smith took her on a shopping spree she likened to the great makeover in 
the movie "Pretty Woman," complete with a chauffeur to Rodeo Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 "She didn't like the way I dressed. She was determined to get me a whole new 
wardrobe," Campbell said. "We went in the back entrance to Hermes and they were 
serving champagne just for us and all the dressmakers were all swirling around 
me and giving me so much attention, 'Try this on, try that on,' and I was 
saying, 'OK, OK, OK,' not knowing that she was buying all this for me." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, there were beautiful gifts. Campbell was welcomed at Smith's ranch 
in San Juan Capistrano and the family's bucolic farm in Middleburg, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 But there were also periodic arguments, and constant messages from family 
members that Marianne would not do, Morton Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not everything goes with (Joan Irvine Smith); you have to maintain a certain 
amount of decorum around her," said Jeff Fink, who was best man at the wedding 
and works in the sports book of a Las Vegas casino. "Marianne just didn't 
maintain that decorum. She was kind of herself. . . . She's very outspoken. 
She's a nice girl and everything, but she's not what Mrs. Smith was looking for 
for her son." 
</P>
<P>
 When Morton proposed marriage on Super Bowl Sunday, 1993, the couple said, 
word came that Morton was not welcome in Smith's Emerald Bay house -- and the 
locks were changed. His possessions from the farm in Middleburg were packed up 
and shipped to California. And then, finally, mom offered the ultimatum: "She 
said, 'If you pick her, you're out of the family,' " Morton Smith recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was kind of like Kadafi drawing the line of death. Then I'd cross the line 
and (she'd) draw a new one in the sand," he said. "It's pretty scary to have 
Joan mad at you. Everyone was scared but me. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm an Irvine, I can take it," he said. "I don't have anything (financial) to 
show for it, but breeding goes a long way."

KEY ALLIES REJECT PLAN FOR ENDING BOSNIA ARMS EMBARGO; BALKANS: BRITAIN, FRANCE 
RESIST LIFTING BAN, EVEN WITH A SIX-MONTH DELAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A compromise proposal on lifting the arms embargo in Bosnia-Herzegovina came 
close to collapse Tuesday under the weight of rejection by key European 
countries. The rejection could compound President Clinton's difficulties with 
Congress over the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The near-collapse was revealed to the U.N. General Assembly by Bosnian 
President Alija Izetbegovic, who outlined the compromise and then told the 
delegates, "Unfortunately, I have learned that this compromise is reaching 
resistance and even rejection from some . . . friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the compromise, which was acceptable to Clinton, Bosnian officials had 
requested that the Security Council pass a resolution lifting the embargo on 
arms sales to Bosnia but delaying its implementation for six months. The delay 
was designed to placate British and French officials who had threatened to 
remove their peacekeepers from the U.N. force in Bosnia if the embargo were 
lifted. 
</P>
<P>
 But, in meetings with British and French officials, Izetbegovic was informed 
that they would reject lifting the embargo, even with the six-month delay, U.N. 
sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. official said, however, that a British and French rejection "did not 
mean that this compromise is still not on the table." And he added that the 
situation "could evolve in the coming weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany have joined in a 
"contact group" to work out a peace settlement in Bosnia, and the Clinton 
Administration would like to fashion a unified position on the arms embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaborating on his government's position, a French official said France could 
consider the compromise if the resolution did not automatically lift the arms 
embargo in six months and if U.N. peacekeeping troops were protected during 
that time. 
</P>
<P>
 France might accept a resolution, the official said, that provided for lifting 
the embargo after six months on condition that this were confirmed by a second 
vote of the Security Council or was recommended by the secretary general. 
</P>
<P>
 The Security Council imposed the embargo before the civil war in Bosnia 
erupted more than two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the war began, the embargo was less troubling for the Bosnian Serbs -- 
who received arms from their allies in Serbia, which had most of the weapons 
that once belonged to the former Yugoslav federation. But the Muslim-dominated 
Bosnian government had no such cache of weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Justice has turned into injustice," Izetbegovic told the General Assembly, 
"because the aggressor had weapons -- which had been stockpiled over 40 years 
time -- while the victim was unarmed, and its hands were kept tied." 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is under pressure to try to lift the embargo. In correspondence with 
Congress, he has pledged to introduce a Security Council resolution lifting the 
embargo by October's end if the war is not over. If the resolution is defeated, 
Clinton, according to the pledge, would consult with Congress about the 
possibility the United States would defy the embargo and sell arms to Bosnia on 
its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The British and French have long opposed ending the arms embargo, insisting 
that such an act would enlarge the war and endanger the lives of U.N. 
peacekeepers in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 In his address to the General Assembly, Izetbegovic was bitter about what he 
called the "confused and hesitant" reaction of the world to the barbarism in 
Bosnia. He recalled that the contact group, when it presented a peace proposal 
to the Bosnian government and the Bosnian Serbs a few months ago, "clearly 
stated that the side who rejected the plan would be punished, while the side 
who accepted the plan would be protected." 
</P>
<P>
 But, he went on, "the opposite happened: Serbs rejected the plan and they have 
been rewarded by the suspension of sanctions. We have accepted the plan, and we 
have been punished by a complete blockade of Sarajevo." 
</P>
<P>
 Izetbegovic was referring to the Security Council resolution last week that 
eased sanctions on Serbia as a reward for pledging to stop arms shipments to 
the Bosnian Serbs. The latest blockade of Sarajevo, reimposed by the Bosnian 
Serbs 10 days ago, is easing now, according to U.N. reports.

FORMER OFFICIAL IS ACQUITTED IN JAPAN BRIBE CASE; ASIA: FIRST VERDICT INVOLVING 
A POLITICIAN IN RECRUIT SCANDAL IS SETBACK IN ANTI-CORRUPTION BATTLE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The battle against corruption in Japan suffered a major setback Tuesday as a 
former chief Cabinet secretary was found not guilty of accepting a bribe -- 
despite having received more than $400,000 in funds from a favor-seeking 
businessman. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first verdict involving a politician in the infamous 
stocks-for-favors Recruit scandal of 1988-89, which spurred the resignation of 
Prime Minister Noboru Takeshita and tainted every leader of the then-ruling 
Liberal Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, a struggle for reform triggered by the scandal precipitated a 
split in the LDP that ended its 38-year stranglehold on power. 
</P>
<P>
 Tokyo District Court Judge Hideaki Mikami had ruled that in 1984 and 1985 
Takao Fujinami, 61, who was chief Cabinet secretary under Prime Minister 
Yasuhiro Nakasone, accepted payments and stock favors worth $427,000 from 
Hiromasa Ezoe, 58, chairman of the Recruit Co. The firm publishes employment 
and education magazines, and Ezoe wanted the government to conduct its 
examinations for the civil service on a schedule that matched his publication 
dates, the judge acknowledged. 
</P>
<P>
 Mikami, however, declared that the money could be considered part of political 
donations that Recruit had been giving Fujinami regularly and said there was no 
evidence showing that he and Ezoe had discussed payments for favors that, in 
any event, had only a "thin" relationship to Fujinami's position. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also ruled invalid a confession that Ezoe signed during pretrial 
interrogations but disavowed during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "This means unless we can produce evidence of a briber handing over money and 
saying, 'This is a bribe,' we can't get a conviction," one unnamed prosecutor 
was quoted as telling NHK, the semi-governmental radio and TV network. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors, who sought a fine equal to the money Fujinami received and a jail 
sentence of 3 1/2 years, said they would appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The judgment underscored the fact that despite extensive political reforms 
carried out this year, corruption remains as protected as ever. Under Japan's 
bribery laws, prosecutors must prove that money was offered and accepted to 
reward an official for using the specific powers of his office to carry out 
government actions. 
</P>
<P>
 So narrow is the definition that dozens of politicians who received windfalls 
from Recruit-arranged stock deals escaped indictment -- including four prime 
ministers. Opportunities that Ezoe, who is on trial for bribery, arranged for 
them were likened to "picking up money with sticky hands." 
</P>
<P>
 "We carried out political reform in self-reflection over this incident," said 
Yoshiro Mori, secretary general of the Liberal Democratic Party, which has 
regained a chunk of power as the major prop of Socialist Prime Minister 
Tomiichi Murayama's tripartite coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Mori, however, indicated that the Liberal Democrats would restore membership 
to Fujinami, who left the party when he was indicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Monday, tax authorities offered another insight into politics as they 
announced the amounts of estates left by two prominent politicians, both of 
whom died in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka, convicted of accepting a $1.8-million 
bribe from the Lockheed Corp., left an estate valued at $119 million to five 
heirs, including his daughter, Makiko Tanaka, who is now minister of science 
and technology in Murayama's Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Although mass media estimated the true worth of Tanaka's estate at $650 
million, his daughter insisted that the family had done nothing to avoid 
inheritance taxes and said tax authorities had properly valued stocks in a 
multitude of family-owned businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 The late Foreign Minister Iichiro Hatoyama, a third-generation politician 
whose two sons now serve in the lower house, left an inheritance of $152 
million, tax authorities said. No one in the Hatoyama family was ever accused 
of wrongdoing.

CHINA GIVES IN ON GAMES ISSUE 
</P>

<P>
 Japan on Tuesday welcomed word that China will dispatch its athletes to the 
Asian Games opening Sunday in Hiroshima, despite a chain of threats against 
Japan for allowing Taiwanese Deputy Prime Minister Hsu Li-teh to attend the 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 The People's Daily in Beijing on Sunday had warned of "grave consequences to 
China-Japan relations."But in New York on Monday, Japanese Foreign Minister 
Yohei Kono told his Chinese counterpart, Qian Qichen, that Tokyo would not 
change its position. Qian called the move "a bad precedent" but said Chinese 
athletes will participate in the games. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada said Tuesday that "the fact that 
Chinese athletes will take part in the Asian Games means that China doesn't 
have any intention of mixing politics with sports, and that position is 
appreciated."

 China had accused Japan and Taiwan of mixing politics with sports. It was the 
first time since Tokyo and Beijing established diplomatic relations in 1972 
that Japan has openly rebuffed a Chinese demand.

TERRORISM; CASE AGAINST MUSLIM CLERIC COULD BLOW UP IN PROSECUTORS' FACES; 
DESPITE HIS AGE, DISABILITIES AND LACK OF A LAWYER, THE SHEIK IS NOT SEEN AS AN 
UNDERDOG IN THE BOMBING PLOT TRIAL.

 Scheduled to face trial in two months, the principal defendant in the next 
U.S. terrorism case is blind, has heart trouble, suffers from diabetes, does 
not speak English and has no legal training. Yet he insists on serving as his 
own defense lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 What chance does radical Muslim Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman have of succeeding 
against charges that he was the spiritual leader of a group of 13 Islamic 
militants bent on blowing up the United Nations building and other Manhattan 
landmarks? 
</P>
<P>
 All signs point to better-than-average prospects. Try as they might, 
investigators have not been able to tie Abdul Rahman clearly and tightly enough 
to the bomb plot, in the opinion of some federal law enforcement officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Without such direct links, the 56-year-old cleric may succeed by arguing he is 
the victim of overzealous federal prosecutors who are searching for a motive by 
twisting the meaning of his religious speeches and whose case against him is so 
weak it relies primarily on recordings of his own inconclusive private 
utterances -- words secretly taped by a government informant who has shown 
himself to be less than reliable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're doing a high-wire act in prosecuting Rahman," one law 
enforcement official said. "There's more evidence against most of the others, 
but trying to tie in Rahman with them could bring down the entire case." 
</P>
<P>
 Circumstances had not always seemed so grim to investigators. Members of the 
U.S. attorney's office in New York breathed a sigh of relief in June when the 
most important defendant besides Abdul Rahman signaled he wanted to cooperate 
with the government and possibly testify against the sheik and others. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision by Siddig Ibrahim Siddig Ali, a 33-year-old Sudanese immigrant, 
seemed to assure that prosecutors would have a key witness inside the alleged 
bombing conspiracy who could strengthen their case and allow them to reduce 
their reliance on the informant, Emad Ali Salem, the sheik's former bodyguard 
who voluntarily helped the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Siddig Ali, after all, had been the sheik's translator, his confidant and his 
foremost aide, as well as the defendant who was Salem's most crucial contact. 
</P>
<P>
 But after several weeks of negotiations over the summer, the deal with Siddig 
Ali fell through -- for reasons that are not entirely clear. So once again the 
government has been left to rely on the erratic Salem. On some of the tapes, 
Salem seems to be the one encouraging criminal acts, leading attorneys for some 
defendants to believe they can convince jurors that their clients were 
illegally entrapped. 
</P>
<P>
 Salem has presented prosecutors with another problem. Besides the body 
recorder supplied by the FBI, the former Egyptian army colonel used his own 
recorder to covertly tape conversations with his FBI handlers, drawing them 
into making embarrassing or improper remarks on some occasions that inevitably 
will become part of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, transcripts of those recordings provided to defense attorneys 
show Salem claiming that he alerted the FBI beforehand to last year's World 
Trade Center bombing and that the FBI had failed to act. Federal officials, 
however, have sought to dismiss his claim as an empty boast intended to inflate 
his own importance. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul Rahman, imprisoned more than a year since his indictment, is planning to 
base his defense largely on claims he was only exercising his right of free 
speech in sermons at his Jersey City, N.J., mosque and in counseling sessions 
with his spiritual followers, many of which Salem recorded. Like all his 
co-defendants, the sheik has pleaded not guilty to government charges that he 
sought "to levy a war of urban terrorism against the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Some high-ranking law enforcement officials, in fact, were divided last year 
on the wisdom of charging the sheik as leader of the alleged conspiracy, 
federal sources have told The Times, because they thought the case against him 
was weak. High FBI officials were said to have argued against charging the 
cleric, preferring instead to limit the indictment to Siddig Ali and other 
defendants who had been photographed by a hidden FBI camera while they mixed 
chemicals in a Queens, N.Y., garage in June, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the acts charged in the alleged conspiracy occurred after the bombing 
of the World Trade Center in February, 1993, in which six people were killed 
and more than 1,000 were injured. In that case, four people were convicted 
earlier this year and have been sentenced to 240 years each in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheik Abdul Rahman and his followers basically are under indictment on charges 
that they conspired to blow up the United Nations building, the Lincoln and 
Holland commuter tunnels and to assassinate U.S. and foreign political leaders, 
including Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak. Their supposed motive: to punish 
the United States for its support of Israel and the current rulers of Egypt. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheik, an avowed enemy of Mubarak's government, is no stranger to court 
proceedings and has successfully defended himself before. More than a decade 
ago, he was acquitted in Egypt of charges that he inspired the assassination of 
President Anwar Sadat in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
 He left Egypt after being charged there in 1989 with inciting an 
anti-government riot. Arriving secretly in Khartoum, he obtained a visa in 1990 
to enter the United States, reportedly with help from CIA agents to whom he had 
supplied information. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people who attended meetings with Atty. Gen. Janet Reno said she overcame 
her own misgivings and those of some subordinates by endorsing conspiracy 
charges against the sheik in August, 1993. Reno believed this was "a case that 
had to be prosecuted" to show the nation's resolve in preventing domestic 
terrorism, the sources said. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul Rahman chose to act as his own defense counsel after U.S. District Judge 
Michael B. Mukasey denied the sheik's request to be represented by New York 
attorney William Kunstler, who long has championed radical causes. Mukasey 
ruled that representation by Kunstler would pose a conflict of interest because 
the well-known lawyer already had other clients in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorney Emanuel A. Moore of Hollis, N.Y., who has been appointed to serve 
as a legal adviser to Abdul Rahman, says the charismatic sheik is an 
outstanding scholar and seems fully capable of handling his own case, even 
though he lacks legal training. 
</P>
<P>
 Government attorneys plan to cite speeches in which Abdul Rahman talked of the 
duty of all Muslims to sacrifice themselves for jihad , or Islamic holy war, 
and called upon his followers to "strike terror into the hearts of the 
enemies." 
</P>
<P>
 Moore said he finds it troubling that prosecutors would use the sheik's public 
speeches and books "that you can buy on the streets of New York City" to 
bolster their contentions that he was responsible for terrorist acts by his 
followers. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheik himself has told the court that the case against him is based on 
nothing more than his expression of political views, which he insists are 
protected by the Constitution. But Judge Mukasey said speech is not protected 
by the First Amendment "when it is the very vehicle of the crime itself." 
</P>
<P>
 In a recent ruling, the judge said that "even speech that includes reference 
to religion may play a part in the commission of a crime." 
</P>
<P>
 The government, however, may be hard-pressed to show Abdul Rahman was the 
driving force for terrorism as he is pictured in the indictment. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, among the 150 hours of conversations recorded by Salem is one in 
which Abdul Rahman actually counsels against an attack on the United Nations 
because "it would muddy the waters for Islam."

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; ARISTIDE MAY REAPPOINT EX-PREMIER; POLITICS: SOURCES 
SAY RENE PREVAL IS ONE OF SIX CANDIDATES UNDER CONSIDERATION. HIS POLICIES 
HELPED SPUR MILITARY COUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rene Preval, the prime minister whose policies during exiled Haitian President 
Jean-Bertrand Aristide's first year in office were so controversial that they 
contributed to Aristide's violent overthrow, is now under consideration for the 
same job, Haitian political sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Preval, a onetime baker and political radical whose very name generates 
vitriol even among political moderates, is one of six candidates to fill the 
prime minister post when Aristide is restored to office. 
</P>
<P>
 That's unsettling news in the unstable political climate brought on by the 
U.S. military occupation with its potential for a violent faceoff between 
Aristide's mass following and the fast-fading regime of a military-civilian 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Even anti-military figures who opposed Aristide's policies but insist on his 
restoration in the name of democracy are alarmed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think Preval's the favorite," said one expert, "but just putting his 
name on the list raises doubts that Aristide is serious about reconciliation or 
that he learned anything from the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide's and Preval's refusal to respond to parliamentary inquiries in 
August, 1991, and their call for popular defiance of the legislature were used 
by opponents to convince the military to revolt a month later. 
</P>
<P>
 News of the list of candidates came at a particularly sensitive moment as 
Haiti's Parliament prepared to meet today for the first time in 16 months to 
debate an amnesty law that is designed to facilitate Aristide's return in the 
next few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an agreement engineered by former President Jimmy Carter, the Parliament 
is supposed to quickly pass an amnesty law covering Haiti's military regime in 
exchange for the resignation of the three most powerful army leaders. Once they 
leave office, Aristide is to return from exile in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 American troops took over the Parliament on Tuesday morning, setting up 
barbed-wire barricades, closing surrounding streets and refusing entry to 
everyone, including building employees and at least one legislator. 
</P>
<P>
 While the soldiers were occupying the legislature and, later in the morning, 
the city hall, other American troops were setting up posts throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at such a position at the Electoral Council office that an unidentified 
U.S. soldier died from a gunshot late Tuesday morning, the first American 
casualty since soldiers began arriving in Haiti a week and a half ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials gave no details, but Pentagon spokesmen said the death was 
an apparent suicide, the result of family problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Today's opening of Parliament is the beginning of a three-day period of 
powerful emotions and terrible apprehension. The symbolism of the resumption of 
a democratic assembly is expected to ignite public demonstrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if those pass without violence, U.S. diplomats and military officials 
fear that the emotions will build Thursday and climax Friday, which is the 
third anniversary of the military coup against Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Popular organizations have called for mass demonstrations and predict that 
hundreds of thousands of people will be in the streets, demanding the army 
leaders' immediate abdication and the return of Aristide. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the legislature's pro-Aristide or anti-military members are currently 
in exile abroad or in hiding here as a result of murderous threats by the army 
and its attaches , the civilian thugs whom the generals often use to terrorize 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Further complicating the political equation are the claims of nine men that 
they were voted into the Senate in January, 1993, when a puppet civilian 
government called elections. The United States and most of the international 
community rejected that vote, but the "illegals" plan on claiming their seats 
when the Parliament convenes this afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 There is additional concern that the exiled and hiding legislators either 
won't make it back in time for the opening session or will remain afraid to 
re-emerge, thus raising the possibility that there will not be sufficient 
attendance for the legislature to do business. 
</P>
<P>
 The special session, convened by Aristide to pass an amnesty bill, also will 
deal with at least five other measures, most of which will generate excitement 
in a Parliament that frequently breaks down in screaming, fist-swinging and 
even the waving of guns. 
</P>
<P>
 That is the way it was Aug. 25, 1991, when Parliament demanded that Preval 
appear to defend his government. Fearing a vote of no-confidence, Preval and 
Aristide refused to appear and called for a popular demonstration of support. 
</P>
<P>
 Hundreds of thousands of Haitians circled the Parliament, brandishing machetes 
and clubs and carrying automobile tires as if they intended to "necklace" the 
legislators with burning tires. 
</P>
<P>
 Several senators and deputies were assaulted, and Parliament was suspended. A 
month later, Aristide was driven from office. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide appointed Preval prime minister in 1991 against the wishes of all but 
his most radical leftist followers -- largely, the experts say, "because 
Aristide thought Preval was the only one he could trust." 
</P>
<P>
 Preval's leftist policies, combined with a stubborn and abrasive manner, 
caused distrust bordering on hatred among business people here, a feeling they 
still retain. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should be shot on sight," said a prominent businesswoman when told Preval 
was on Aristide's short list for prime minister. "He is evil." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the sources, the others on the list are Leslie Delatour, a widely 
respected economist and former finance minister; Leslie Voltaire, Aristide's 
minister of education; Spark Michel, a wealthy businessman who gave Aristide 
significant financial backing during his campaign; George Anglad, a geography 
professor who has lived and taught in Canada for most of the past 25 years, and 
Marie-Michele Rey, a wealthy banker whom Aristide named as his finance 
minister. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the sources said Rey would be the best, if not the most likely, choice 
to run Aristide's government for the 17 months remaining in his term. 
</P>
<P>
 In another development Tuesday, mobs looted a food warehouse near the capital, 
carrying off tons of rice and other food. It was the fourth such raid in the 
country in two days. With the Haitian police and military seriously impeded by 
American rules prohibiting force against demonstrators, there was no protection 
for the warehouses. U.S. forces were either too far away to intervene or 
arrived on the scene too late.

CRISIS IN THE CARIBBEAN; HAITI WITHDRAWAL DEADLINE DEBATED; LEGISLATION: 
CLINTON ADMINISTRATION OFFICIALS TESTIFY ON CAPITOL HILL. EVEN FRIENDLY 
LAWMAKERS WARN THAT CONGRESS IS LIKELY TO FIX AN END POINT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration sought Tuesday to head off congressional moves to 
set a deadline for the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Haiti, but even its 
Democratic allies warned that Congress is now virtually certain to fix such a 
date before adjourning next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration came in for sharp criticism from Democrats and Republicans 
alike as Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott and other senior officials 
testified before the House Foreign Affairs Committee, which is drafting 
legislation that would set a March 1 deadline for the completion of the Haiti 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a weekend firefight between U.S troops and Haitian police and sporadic 
civil unrest since then, the U.S. effort to restore order in Haiti is going 
well, Talbott said. The progress could be jeopardized if Congress sets a 
deadline that would only "embolden our foes" by giving the military junta and 
its supporters notice of when the troops will be leaving, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Setting a withdrawal date could also undermine the Administration's goal of 
turning the Haiti peacekeeping mission over to a United Nations force as soon 
as possible, because other nations may be reluctant to contribute troops when 
they know "that the United States is going to check out," agreed Deputy Defense 
Secretary John M. Deutch. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch said the Pentagon hopes to complete the first phase of the mission and 
turn over its peacekeeping responsibilities to a 6,000-member U.N. force "in 
less than six months." Most of the 15,000 U.S. troops in Haiti would then be 
withdrawn, with no more than 3,000 remaining behind to constitute the largest 
contingent of the U.N. force. 
</P>
<P>
 But setting a firm withdrawal date could upset that transition because it 
would allow supporters of military leader Lt. Gen. Raoul Cedras to "plan 
incidents around that certain date" so that the U.N. troops may be reluctant to 
take over after the Americans leave, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the congressional misgivings about the mission -- as well as anger over 
President Clinton's refusal to seek the consent of lawmakers before dispatching 
the troops -- were evident in the skeptical to openly hostile reaction from the 
foreign affairs panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Haitian democracy "may have been enhanced by the American occupation but . . . 
democracy in the United States has not been helped" by the Administration's 
decision to commit the nation without congressional consent to "an expensive 
operation in which there will almost certainly be loss of life," Rep. Robert G. 
Torricelli (D-N.J.) told Talbott. 
</P>
<P>
 Privately, several other Democrats added that the Administration understands 
that public sentiment against the occupation is still running too strong for 
Congress, in a tough election year, to adjourn Oct. 7 without setting a 
termination date for the mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Health care may be dead and campaign finance reform may be dying, but even if 
we do nothing else, we have to be able to tell the voters on Nov. 8 that we did 
something to bring the troops home," one Democratic lawmaker said. The only 
question, he added, is "not whether there will be a deadline, but how much 
flexibility will be built into it, how much face the Administration will be 
able to save." 
</P>
<P>
 Congress technically has two options for imposing a withdrawal date on the 
Administration. One would be to invoke the 1973 War Powers Act, which would 
require Clinton to seek congressional authorization for the Haiti mission or 
terminate it within 60 days. That option, however, could set up a messy legal 
confrontation between Congress and the White House because Clinton, like his 
Republican predecessors, refuses to acknowledge the constitutionality of the 
act. 
</P>
<P>
 A more plausible way for Congress to intervene would be to follow the 
precedent it set last year during the Somalia crisis, when it exercised its 
power of the purse to cut off funds for the U.S. military mission after a 
certain date. 
</P>
<P>
 Although many lawmakers favor that option, Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman 
Lee H. Hamilton (D-Ind.) is drafting a third alternative that has slightly less 
weight. Congress would authorize the troops to remain in Haiti until March 1, a 
step that would oblige Clinton to seek an extension if he wants to avoid a 
major clash with Congress. If Clinton did not comply, Congress could be 
expected to either invoke the War Powers Act or cut off funding. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the mission is going well, if it has support, then he ought to be able to 
get consent to extend it if it's really necessary to do so. . . . But Clinton 
has to understand that, especially after Somalia, Congress is not going to give 
him a totally free hand in Haiti," a senior committee aide said.

U.S. CONSIDERS ALLOWING SALES OF RUSSIAN HANDGUNS; TRADE: OFFICIALS SAY LETTING 
MOSCOW EXPORT WEAPONS TO AMERICA COULD HELP END KREMLIN'S ARMS DEALS WITH IRAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bowing to Russia's desperate need for export earnings, the Clinton 
Administration is moving toward a decision to let Moscow sell a famous Russian 
product in the United States: handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the Makarov semiautomatic pistol, favorite side arm of KGB spies 
and Cold War bad guys, may soon come to a gun store near you. 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. gun importer has filed an application to sell as many as 7 million 
Russian firearms in the United States, and the Administration is leaning toward 
approving at least part of the deal, officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision is still being debated between the Treasury Department's Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which is hesitant to open U.S. gates to more 
inexpensive gun imports, and the State Department, which wants to give visiting 
Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin a break. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has been putting major pressure on Yeltsin to stop selling 
submarines, tanks and high-tech weapons to Iran -- and some U.S. officials see 
the low-tech handgun deal as a reasonable substitute. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we want them to listen to us on issues like Iran, we have to let them 
compete on the world market with products they can sell," a State Department 
official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he acknowledged the irony of the Administration, which has argued for 
stricter gun control at home, now advocating bringing Russian guns into the 
country. "A lot of people think it's nutty to start importing Russian 
handguns," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The likely outcome, he said, will be "a common-sense solution" -- one that 
lets the Russians sell some weapons without flooding the American market. 
</P>
<P>
 An official at the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, which regulates 
arms imports, confirmed that the issue was under discussion but refused to 
provide details. 
</P>
<P>
 But other officials said the importer's initial application had been for a 
whopping 7 million guns -- half of them handguns -- and billions of rounds of 
ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be almost three times the number of firearms imported into the 
United States in 1992, the last year for which the ATF has statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 But the actual number of Russian guns imported would probably be much smaller, 
as importers routinely file applications for far more items than they really 
expect to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The total number of guns in the United States in 1992 was about 212 million, 
including nearly 72 million handguns. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's state-owned arms industry has found itself awash in surplus guns 
since the collapse of the Soviet Union and the shrinkage of Russia's armed 
forces from more than 5 million to fewer than 2 million troops. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of that oversupply, the Russian imports would almost surely sell for 
less than comparable U.S.-made guns. The 9-millimeter Makarov pistol, for 
example, already sells in limited numbers in the United States for about $150; 
large-scale imports would drive the price down. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, there may be a market opening for low-priced Russian handguns since 
the Administration restricted firearms imports from China earlier this year. 
China shipped hundreds of thousands of pistols, assault rifles and other guns 
to the United States beginning in the mid-1980s, but Clinton virtually stopped 
the trade earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States also imports large numbers of guns from Austria, Belgium, 
Brazil, Canada, the Czech Republic, Germany and Italy. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Cold War, virtually all Russian guns were barred from the United 
States under import regulations that remain in effect. But importers can apply 
to the ATF and State Department for specific licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at both the ATF and State Department refused to identify the dealer 
who has applied for the license under consideration. But they did say that the 
application does not include the AK-47 assault rifle, whose import was banned 
by a law passed earlier this year.

WHITE HOUSE CEREMONY HONORS U.S., RUSSIAN VETERANS OF WW II

 The German U-boat took deadly aim and torpedoed the American transport ship 
Crockett into oblivion just three days out of Arkhangelsk in the frigid Russian 
Far North. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Merchant Marine radio operator Thomas Sofranko, now of Chula Vista, 50 
years ago this week found himself in a rescue boat tossed on the heavy swells 
of the northern seas, having nearly lost his life to deliver a huge load of 
armaments and supplies to the Soviet war effort. 
</P>
<P>
 And on Tuesday, at long last, the Kremlin and the White House formally honored 
fighters like Sofranko and Alexander Olshansky, a Soviet infantryman who took 
part in the victorious 1945 meeting of Soviet and American troops on the Elbe 
River in Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 With the last ideological barriers long gone, President Clinton and Russian 
President Boris N. Yeltsin took an hour out of their lofty summit discussions 
to reflect on what good partners Russia and America made in the fight against 
fascism -- and what a pity it was that the partnership was lost for almost 50 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gather to guarantee that the opportunity we lost to build a better world 
five decades ago will not be lost again," Clinton told a solemn gathering in 
the sun-drenched White House Rose Garden. "We vow, finally, to realize the 
promise of that embrace at the Elbe." 
</P>
<P>
 Official celebrations of the Elbe meeting -- the link-up of allied forces that 
meant Adolf Hitler was truly finished in Europe -- will come next April at its 
50th anniversary. 
</P>
<P>
 But the White House apparently chose to preempt the main ceremonies by 
awarding medals at this week's summit because other World War II commemorative 
events recently -- in Berlin and at the D-day celebrations in Normandy -- left 
out the Russians, evoking deep indignation in the nation that suffered the 
greatest numerical losses to Nazi Germany. More than 20 million Soviet citizens 
died in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rose Garden ceremony for 20 Russian and 20 American veterans was meant to 
smooth over those snubs. And what rancor remained seemed far outweighed by the 
goodwill of old comradeship. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need to divide victory -- who did more, who did less," said 
Olshansky, now a Russian major general, who received a special medal of honor 
from Clinton on behalf of Russian veterans. "We all sacrificed tremendously, 
and that's why we won." 
</P>
<P>
 Olshansky -- a tall, spare engineering specialist who was drafted out of ninth 
grade -- began his Red Army career on the outskirts of Stalingrad. He went on 
to help take Berlin and Prague, was wounded three times and finished the 10th 
grade as a seasoned lieutenant six years later. His sister was a 
machine-gunner, his father helped take Prague just a few streets over -- 
although neither knew it at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Of his original division of 11,000, only eight men were left by the time he 
got to the Elbe, Olshansky said. 
</P>
<P>
 It remains a miracle to him that he survived, and he is convinced that it was 
the hideous experiences of World War II veterans that kept nuclear conflict 
from breaking out later. 
</P>
<P>
 Equally astounding was the story of Sofranko, now 69, a retired computer 
specialist for the Amoco Oil Co. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crockett had sailed in a convoy from Arkhangelsk on Sept. 26, 1944, after 
delivering a giant load of locomotives, tanks, airplanes, food and other 
materials to the Soviet forces. At 4:30 p.m., Sofranko recalled, when they were 
"at a point farther north than the north coast of Alaska," the torpedo hit. 
</P>
<P>
 He described vividly the terrifying moment when the lifeboat, already rocking 
in the waves, almost went over, which would have doomed the seamen to 
near-instant death. 
</P>
<P>
 "The seamen were holding on to the chocks that you lower the lifeboat with," 
he said, "when the swell brought the boat up and the chock caught under the bow 
of the lifeboat and the lifeboat upended and could have dumped the entire 
lifeboat into the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 "Luckily, the seaman at the bow had his life jacket and knife with him -- 
which he kept razor sharp -- which turned out to be well worth it because he 
slashed those ropes with one sweep."

CLINTON, YELTSIN DISCUSS ENDING IRAN ARMS SALES; SUMMIT: U.S. OFFICIALS ARE 
OPTIMISTIC. CASH-STRAPPED RUSSIA EARNS $1 BILLION A YEAR ON WEAPONRY FOR 
TEHRAN. 
</P>

 President Clinton and Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin opened their fifth 
meeting in 18 months Tuesday with an informal two-hour chat in the calm setting 
of the White House garden and a sign that Russia may agree to phase out its 
$1-billion annual arms sales to Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that there's a resolution in sight on this very difficult issue," 
Secretary of State Warren Christopher told reporters after the first of two 
sessions between the leaders Tuesday. "That will be discussed again (today)." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the solution would involve "some approach" to ending the Russian sales 
to Iran but refused to divulge any details until the deal is concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 For cash-strapped Russia, weapons sales have taken on increasing importance, 
and Iran has become a major customer -- buying submarines, combat planes and 
missile technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchases particularly worry Clinton Administration officials because of 
intelligence reports that say Iran, in addition to buying large numbers of 
conventional weapons, has been pursuing nuclear technology. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this summer at a meeting in Naples, Italy, Yeltsin offered assurances 
that he would at least consider cutting back sales to Iran, but until Tuesday 
U.S. officials saw no progress. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense factories that once dominated the Russian economy are now in 
horrendous straits. Government orders have dropped to nearly nothing, but the 
factories lack the money to switch over to peacetime production and remain 
unwilling to lay off the populations of entire towns that depend on them. 
Moscow argues that it must continue to export arms -- even if that means 
selling to states like Iran. 
</P>
<P>
 Boris Kuzik, Yeltsin's adviser on arms sales, who accompanied the Russian 
president to Washington, told reporters in a pre-summit briefing that Moscow 
simply wants the global arms market to be a fair race. "There should be normal 
competition," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton discussed U.S. objections to the arms sales "in some detail" with 
Yeltsin, said a U.S. official who briefed reporters afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Yeltsin had been scheduled to spend the opening hours of their 
summit meeting in a formal session with top officials from both governments. 
But in keeping with his belief that he can accomplish more with less formality 
in international discussions, Clinton instead took his guest on a brief tour of 
memorabilia in the Oval Office and then escorted him outside to the patio. 
</P>
<P>
 The talks were "very upbeat, very friendly -- at times informal and at times 
very direct," said the U.S. briefer. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton and Yeltsin discussed the Russian arms sales as well as the continuing 
war in Bosnia-Herzegovina, the prospects of settling the war between Armenia 
and Azerbaijan and Clinton's recent decision to lift many U.S. trade 
restrictions on Russia, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 As he welcomed Yeltsin to the White House in a ceremony on the South Lawn, 
Clinton noted that "it wasn't so long ago that Russian-American summits were 
moments of high drama and sometimes disappointing results." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, by contrast, much of the drama is gone. While the two nations still 
possess massive nuclear forces, they are no longer engaged in the struggle of 
the Cold War. "The Russian-American relationship is at last, remarkably, a 
normal one," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 That normality does not, however, mean an absence of problems. "The United 
States," Yeltsin said in his arrival remarks, "is a strong partner and not an 
easy one to deal with, just like Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 A reminder of the problems between the two countries came during a White House 
photo session, when a reporter asked Yeltsin what his response would be if the 
United States were to try to lift the arms embargo on Bosnia, as Congress has 
urged and as Clinton repeatedly has threatened to do. 
</P>
<P>
 "My response would be negative, of course," Yeltsin responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Luckily for Clinton's relations with Yeltsin, the Bosnian government has 
decided that -- at least for now -- it too does not want the arms embargo 
lifted, fearing the move might provoke a sudden attack by Bosnian Serb forces 
before the government could prepare its defenses. The Bosnians "may be 
interested in deferring any action on that for four to six months," Clinton 
said after Yeltsin spoke. "At least for the moment, this may be a largely 
academic discussion." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the two presidents agreed to continue to try to find ways to 
pressure the Serbs to accept international terms for ending the country's civil 
war but had also agreed to keep the "solidarity of the contact group" -- 
diplomatic code for avoiding any moves that might cause dissension among the 
United States, Russia, Britain, France and Germany in their policies toward 
Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Yeltsin once again brought up his proposal for an 
international summit meeting on Bosnia but they made it clear that the 
Administration has little enthusiasm for the notion.SUMMIT CONFERENC

BID TO FREEZE ASSETS OF AMBASSADOR HARRIMAN IS REJECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge Tuesday declined to freeze the assets of U.S. Ambassador to 
France Pamela Harriman, ruling that there is little risk of her hiding funds or 
fleeing from a complicated legal fight with other heirs of the estate left by 
her late husband, financier and former New York Gov. W. Averell Harriman. 
</P>
<P>
 In a case that offers a window on the monetary affairs of the wealthy, three 
generations of Harriman's heirs contend that Mrs. Harriman and prominent 
Washington lawyers Clark M. Clifford and Paul C. Warnke were "grossly 
negligent" and committed "professional malpractice" in violating the terms of 
limited partnership agreements and trusts. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriman's daughters, grandchildren and great-grandchildren claim that nine 
trusts going back to 1935 were squandered by the defendants on ill-conceived 
investments -- mainly a troubled 560-room New Jersey resort and conference 
center. 
</P>
<P>
 The former governor and veteran diplomat died on July 26, 1986, leaving an 
estate valued at about $65 million. The heirs charge that trust funds once 
worth about $25 million have dwindled to $3 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But U.S. District Judge John S. Martin Jr. ruled that Mrs. Harriman, a 
prominent Democratic Party fund-raiser who helped President Clinton's election 
campaign, still has assets of more than $30 million -- more than enough to 
satisfy any eventual judgment in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Plaintiffs have not sufficiently established that there exists a real threat 
to their ability to enforce a judgment against Harriman and Clifford and that 
drastic action is required," Martin said in his written opinion. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran trust and estate lawyers said that unless a settlement is reached, the 
case could go on for years, with issues to be litigated including whether 
Harriman's widow was a figurehead and decisions were made by others, whether 
investments were reasonable and what knowledge advisers had when they decided 
to allocate money. 
</P>
<P>
 Pamela Harriman, who once was wed to Winston Churchill's son, Randolph, 
married Averell Harriman in 1971 when he was 79 and she was 51. She quickly 
became one of Washington's premier hostesses and Democratic Party fund-raisers. 
</P>
<P>
 When Harriman, who served as ambassador to the Soviet Union and Great Britain, 
died in 1986, he left her $33 million of his $65-million estate, according to 
court papers. The will also named her executor of his estate, with some 
responsibility for administering trusts Harriman set up in 1935 for his 
daughters and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 The will left only $4,000 in cash to each of his two daughters, "not for any 
lack of love and affection for them but because I know them to be otherwise 
well provided for." 
</P>
<P>
 Two years before he died, he asked Clifford, who was secretary of defense 
under President Lyndon B. Johnson, and Warnke, who served as President Jimmy 
Carter's chief arms negotiator, to serve as unpaid trustees of the trusts. 
After his death, the trusts were consolidated in an investment pool, 
administered by a New York lawyer, William Rich III, who is also a defendant in 
the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 At first the trusts did well, growing to about $25 million. But when 
investments turned from the stock market to real estate, the results were 
hardly stellar. According to court papers, there was little diversification of 
assets. The Seasons Resort and Conference Center in Vernon Valley, N.J., where 
the trusts were heavily allocated, proved to be a financial sinkhole. According 
to the lawsuit, by 1993 the resort had gobbled up $21 million of the trusts' 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Harriman's heirs charge -- and the defendants deny -- that the extent of the 
investment in the resort and other troubled ventures was concealed. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the heirs had argued before Judge Martin that Harriman's widow was 
liquidating real estate in Washington and Barbados and was giving other assets 
away or transferring them overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge ruled "none of the purported transfers of assets plaintiffs have 
highlighted raise any inference of an attempt to evade potential judgments, and 
Harriman has provided reasonable explanations for all of them."

NON-UNANIMOUS JURY IDEA APPEALS TO SOME REFORMERS; LAW: PROSECUTORS LOVE -- AND 
DEFENSE LAWYERS HATE -- SYSTEM USED FOR MOST FELONIES IN OREGON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSH MEYER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One more high-profile trial torpedoed by a holdout juror or two, Los Angeles 
County Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti hints, and a "crisis in credibility" in the 
judicial system may prompt calls for an overhaul. 
</P>
<P>
 It may even cause Californians to look to Louisiana and Oregon, the only two 
states where those tried for any felony except murder can be convicted -- or 
acquitted -- even if two of 12 jurors disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 The unanimous jury system, evolved from English common law 600 years ago, is 
so enshrined in the American consciousness that few even know there are 
alternatives. Yet here in the ornate old Multnomah County Courthouse, 
non-unanimous juries have been the norm in felony cases since 1934. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors and court administrators love the system, saying there are far 
fewer hung juries and more people in prison who deserve to be there. Most 
judges seem to like it too, saying it is a fair and efficient way of meting out 
justice without compromising defendants' rights. 
</P>
<P>
 But many defense lawyers hate it. And then there are people such as Timothy 
Alan Hinkhouse, 24. "It's not right; it's not fair," Hinkhouse said in a phone 
interview from the Oregon State Penitentiary in Salem. He was sentenced to 70 
years for attempted murder, despite one juror who obstinately refused to 
convict him. "It keeps Oregon's largest business going, which is the prison 
system." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court has upheld the Oregon system. But is that system better 
than the rest of the nation's? Experts say there are far too many variables to 
compare the two. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert MacCoun, a UC Berkeley public policy professor and former RAND scholar, 
said that despite the conventional wisdom that they favor prosecutors, 
non-unanimous juries do not improve conviction rates. One landmark study in 
1966 found that juries leaning toward acquittal deadlock more than those 
supporting conviction. 
</P>
<P>
 Non-unanimous juries do appear to significantly cut down on hung juries. When 
the Oregon law was challenged in 1971, states requiring unanimous verdicts had 
hung jury rates of 5.6% in felony trials, nearly double the 3.1% rate for 
states with non-unanimous jury verdicts, according to Oregon's then-Solicitor 
General Jacob Tanzer, who argued the case before the U.S. Supreme Court. (In 
contrast, Los Angeles County has a 13.4% hung jury rate in felony trials.) 
</P>
<P>
 Some studies also suggest that because jurors do not have to reach consensus, 
they do not deliberate as long, or as thoughtfully -- though Tanzer and other 
experts disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 "The beauty of our system is that it (keeps) the one crackpot, the one person 
that will never see things the way others do, from holding up the entire system 
of justice," Tanzer said in an interview in his office overlooking the 
Willamette River. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanzer won over the high court in a 5-4 decision by arguing that the 
non-unanimous verdict still protects citizens from vengeful and wrongful 
prosecution, establishes their guilt beyond a reasonable doubt and makes it 
easier for jurors to come to a decision. Many times, he said, jurors reach 
unanimity only after long and brutal deliberations, when they are pressured 
into conformity or simply want to return to their jobs and families. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense lawyers have fits, saying the ability of 10 jurors to overrule two 
jurors only makes it easier for their clients to be wrongfully convicted. 
University of Michigan Prof. Richard Lempert said: "Suppose they find more 
people innocent who are actually guilty? We don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 He's no legal scholar, but bag maker John Bishop agrees with some experts in 
saying it all comes down to common sense. "It should be unanimous," said 
Bishop, waiting in the Multnomah courthouse's wide marble hallways for a break 
in a friend's case. "If they can't convince two of those people, maybe 
something ain't right with the case." 
</P>
<P>
 Even in Oregon and Louisiana there must be a unanimous conviction or acquittal 
in a murder case. But juries in the past have often deadlocked on murder 
charges, only to reduce the charges to manslaughter and achieve an 11-1 
conviction, said Tanzer, who is now a trial lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 In other states, including California, prosecutors have to prevail 
unanimously. Each juror has the power to derail the entire prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 USC Law School Prof. Erwin Chemerinsky, who is monitoring the O.J. Simpson 
case, said the potential for deadlock is enormous given the heated emotions, 
vaunted Simpson legal team and hard-to-understand scientific evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 "All you need is one person not willing to convict because of his (Simpson's) 
popularity and this case ends up with a hung jury," Chemerinsky said. "There is 
enormous tolerance for idiosyncratic behavior because we don't want to exclude 
the one angry man." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Garcetti refused to discuss the Simpson case, such fears are surely 
on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 He broached the subject this year at a public meeting when he called for a 
comprehensive look at the entire jury system, shortly after hung juries in the 
Menendez brothers' murder trials. Garcetti later acknowledged that losses in 
several high-profile cases indicate the need for widespread reform, including 
making jury instructions easier for jurors to understand. Non-unanimous juries, 
he said, are "something that we may have to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcetti said he is concerned that some jurors may intentionally "ignore the 
law or the evidence and vote because of personal or political agendas." 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years ago, then Los Angeles County Dist. Atty. Robert Philibosian tried to 
get non-unanimous juries approved by the state Legislature and failed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald Chaleff, past president of the Los Angeles County Bar Assn., said that 
opposition from trial lawyers to such a move would be formidable even today. He 
said he has tried several cases in which jurors were 11 to 1 one way and ended 
up unanimously going the other way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are moving more and more to a system of 'arrest them and lock 'em up,' and 
eliminating the middle part, which is to convict them," Chaleff said. "But when 
we do that we begin to convict more innocent people. We are talking about 
people's lives and their liberty. It is dangerous."

POOR CONDITIONS TRY JURORS' PATIENCE; COURTS: SHABBY, CROWDED WAITING ROOMS 
THAT OFTEN LACK TV LEAVE PANELISTS IN L.A. COUNTY BORED.

 You can't drink the water in many Los Angeles County jury assembly rooms. 
There's a chance you won't even get a seat while you are waiting -- if there is 
a waiting room at all. 
</P>
<P>
 Want to call to postpone or cancel jury service? Good luck. Even Gloria Gomez, 
manager of juror services, admits that you probably will not get through. 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to jury duty in Los Angeles County, where many say it is a wonder 
anyone serves at all. The creature comforts are minimal, and for some, a 
disincentive to ever serve again. 
</P>
<P>
 Twelve of the county's 28 Superior Court and Municipal Court jury assembly 
rooms have not been renovated in more than 10 years. Tattered furniture is the 
norm. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are not, in my view, very user-friendly," Gomez said. "Torrance? Boy, 
I'll tell you, that is a very bad assembly room in every way, shape and form. 
We don't like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Many others aren't much better. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the San Fernando courthouse was damaged in the January earthquake, 
jurors now squeeze in with those in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Some assembly rooms are so crowded that people are forced to wait in hallways. 
Some potential jurors are told they can leave to make room for others after 
they have done most of their 10-day service. Malibu, Gomez said, does not even 
have a jury room. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the rooms often lack televisions, snack machines and even magazines, 
prospective jurors get bored and edgy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't done a . . . thing," commercial engineer Ingram Clark, 70, bellowed 
as he left the Downtown civil courthouse last Wednesday. "You sit in that chair 
all day, and there's so damned many people. It's standing room only." 
</P>
<P>
 These are serious problems, but there is a budget crisis, noted Gomez, whose 
office roof leaks. She dreams of soon being able to have a system like that in 
Kern County, where jurors wait in a large, cool, art-filled room. There is a 
lunch area, a reading room, cable TV and board games. There are lots of new 
magazines and newspapers, even personal lockers. 
</P>
<P>
 "This place is totally different," Kern County juror Teresa Soto said. "It was 
built with our comfort in mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors in Ventura and Orange counties seem happy to have nice surroundings and 
things to do to pass the time. Both counties also use what many say is a more 
tolerable "one day, one trial" system, which requires just one day of service 
unless a person gets on a jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County has rejected that system, saying it would be a logistic 
nightmare to handle new jury pools each day. To cut costs and make jury service 
more palatable, the county halved the required 10-day term in 1992, but soon 
went back to the old system because employers were not cooperating. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials also are trying to fix the phone system, which has proved so 
maddeningly inaccessible that many prospective jurors show up in person, fuming 
because they could not reach anyone by phone to cancel or postpone their duty. 
"They get angry as all get-out," Gomez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County court officials will soon set up an automated system to 
handle more calls and allow people to postpone jury service via computer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking all the time at making the doggone system more accessible," 
Gomez said. "Jurors deserve much better."

THE SPIN / BILL BOYARSKY: DIVINING POTENTIAL JURORS' REAL RACIAL ATTITUDES A 
DAUNTING CHALLENGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL BOYARSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the most difficult tasks in preparing the questionnaire for prospective 
O.J. Simpson jurors is how to write questions that will accurately determine 
their attitudes toward race. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury candidates, undergoing the voir dire questioning process, are filling out 
a 75-page questionnaire prepared by Judge Lance A. Ito and the prosecution and 
defense teams. It seeks to determine the panelists' feelings about the Simpson 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 Race is one of those areas under examination. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson, who is African American, is charged with the brutal stabbing murders 
of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman, 
both of whom were white. A Times poll, taken last week, showed some racially 
polarized attitudes about the trial. Of those who have made up their minds, 
most whites, Latinos and Asian Americans think Simpson is guilty while most 
blacks believe he is not guilty. 
</P>
<P>
 But, importantly, the survey also showed that 47% of whites, 55% of Latinos, 
48% of Asian Americans and 50% of blacks had made no judgment. It's also 
important to remember that Simpson was a football hero, his appeal cutting 
across racial lines so strongly that he became the Hertz Corp.'s longtime 
television rent-a-car salesman. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with this multiracial appeal, however, the Simpson defense team thinks 
it's important to determine racial attitudes. "The question is: 'Are you in 
touch with your biases? Can you put them aside?' That's what we're really 
talking about," Simpson attorney Johnnie L. Cochran Jr. said recently. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's unlikely that the prospective jurors will be confronted with such blunt 
questions. Students of public opinion have long known that people lie to 
pollsters when asked directly about race. "It is very difficult to get at 
prejudice," said Susan Pinkus, assistant director of The Times Poll. "People 
know what to say so other people won't think they are prejudiced." 
</P>
<P>
 On Tuesday I talked to an expert in figuring out jury attitudes, David B. 
Graeven, president of Trial Behavior Consulting Inc., a San Francisco firm that 
advises attorneys on jury selection. The company has prepared 750 jury 
questionnaires in the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the year, I'd read an article by Graeven in Los Angeles Lawyer, the 
L.A. County Bar Assn. magazine, in which he'd dealt with how to squeeze the 
truth out of potential jurors with questionnaires. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the greatest fears people have is speaking in public," Graeven wrote. 
"Potential jurors are no exception. They report that during oral voir dire, 
they feel uncomfortable and are afraid of embarrassment. . . . To protect 
themselves, jurors will minimize the length of their answers or say they have 
no opinion. When jurors shut down in this way, it is difficult for an attorney, 
no matter how skilled, to obtain enough information. 
</P>
<P>
 "On a juror questionnaire, it is possible for jurors to reflect more of their 
own views about the issues in a case without the social pressure of speaking in 
public. Questions can be arranged in a careful sequence that will guide 
potential jurors through their attitudes about an area of controversy." 
</P>
<P>
 When we chatted on the phone Tuesday, I asked Graeven about the questions he 
uses to cut through to true racial attitudes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask questions in a number of different ways," he said. "One is, 'Is there 
any reason why you would hesitate to buy a Japanese car?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than ask outright about interracial marriages, Graeven said, he'd pose 
such questions as: How comfortable would you be having a friend who is in an 
interracial marriage? How would you feel if your child were in an interracial 
marriage? Do you have objections to interracial couples having a child? Do you 
think interracial marriages have a chance to succeed? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The reaction to Simpson's interracial marriage is one of the most puzzling and 
interesting issues facing those charged with selecting the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 When I discussed this with Joe Duff, an attorney and president of the Los 
Angeles NAACP chapter, he talked about "the Jack Johnson syndrome." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson was an early 20th-Century black world heavyweight boxing champion with 
a white lover. America was outraged and Jackson was prosecuted and convicted of 
violating the Mann Act -- transporting a woman over state lines for immoral 
purposes. He jumped bail and fled to Canada and Europe, eventually marrying the 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jack Johnson syndrome, Duff said, cuts two ways. Among African Americans, 
"being champion is good, but the champion who has a white wife is not. People 
will turn on him." But on the other hand, he said, African Americans are 
watching whites "to see what is going to happen with this guy. Did he step too 
far? Is he going to get it because of that factor, the Jack Johnson syndrome?" 
</P>
<P>
 These questions involve America's deepest and most secret attitudes, shaped 
and even inflamed by unprecedented news coverage. No matter how much thought 
and preparation went into the questionnaires now being filled out in the 
courthouse, they may never be answered truthfully.

U.S. UNVEILS HEALTH INDUSTRY ANTITRUST GUIDELINES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only a day after the official death of health care reform, the Clinton 
Administration unveiled antitrust guidelines Tuesday that detail the 
circumstances under which hospitals, doctors and other health care providers 
may discuss mergers, acquisitions and joint ventures -- and thus seem likely to 
quicken the pace of consolidations throughout the industry. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines should expedite "pro-competitive, cost-lowering transactions" 
that reduce aggregate health care spending as well as individual, out-of-pocket 
costs for consumers, said Anne K. Bingaman, assistant attorney general for 
antitrust. 
</P>
<P>
 The promulgation of the new and expanded guidelines, which number 106 pages, 
is clear recognition of the fact that the medical industry has been undergoing 
broad realignment even in the absence of legislation on health reform -- and of 
clear rules of conduct for providers. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing of the Justice Department announcement -- a day after Senate 
Majority Leader George J. Mitchell (D-Me.) threw in the towel on health care 
reform -- was a coincidence, since the latest rules have been in the making for 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the action nevertheless underscored the Administration's determination to 
stay active in the health care reform arena despite the demise of what was to 
have been the centerpiece of the President's first term in office. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the guidelines further illuminated the ongoing sea changes in the 
vast medical-industrial complex, which is quickly altering the way most 
Americans receive and pay for health care. 
</P>
<P>
 As a way to cut costs, hospitals throughout the country have been merging at a 
dizzying pace. At the same time, big insurance companies have been organizing 
fast-growing and highly cost-conscious managed care networks that are 
increasingly popular with employers. 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over antitrust considerations also points up one of the many 
issues over which odd alliances were formed that helped doom the President's 
health reform initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Urgently seeking antitrust relief are the nation's doctors, who want to be 
able to get together and set prices, market their services and engage in other 
collaborative practices -- to compete squarely with the increasingly powerful 
managed care networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Fighting the physicians is an unlikely alliance of consumer groups and health 
insurers, who say that if doctors are allowed to operate with immunity from 
antitrust laws, they will form price-gouging cartels and squeeze non-physicians 
out of the market. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, Bingaman and Federal Trade Commission Chairwoman Janet D. Steiger 
unveiled nine guidelines -- three new ones and the others expansions of rules 
issued a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, a 1993 guideline allowed hospitals to enter into joint ventures 
to buy and operate new high-tech equipment; that rule has been expanded to 
include existing medical equipment as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven of the guidelines define "safety zones" of conduct -- essentially areas 
of protected behavior that will not be challenged except under certain, 
unspecified "extraordinary circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Another 1993 guideline permitted competing hospitals under certain conditions 
to participate in surveys of prices, wages and fees; now this "safety zone" has 
been broadened to cover all groups of providers. 
</P>
<P>
 The rules were hailed by Sen. Howard M. Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), who said they 
should "help doctors, hospitals, nurses and rural providers better understand 
how the antitrust laws apply to new kinds of mergers, joint ventures, networks 
and other deals."

REPUBLICANS VOW CONSERVATIVE CHANGE; POLITICS: INCUMBENTS, CANDIDATES UNVEIL 
AGENDA THEY PROMISE TO MAKE LAW IF THE GOP TAKES CONTROL OF THE HOUSE. 
DEMOCRATS DENOUNCE IT AS A FRAUD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM J. EATON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Hoping to seize control of the House for the first time in 40 years, about 300 
Republican incumbents and GOP candidates Tuesday signed a manifesto outlining 
changes they pledged to write into law if they win a majority in the November 
elections. 
</P>
<P>
 The 10-point platform, which Democrats denounced as unworkable and a fraud on 
the public, promises action on a balanced-budget amendment, a presidential 
line-item veto, massive family tax cuts and other popular issues. It made no 
mention of health care legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 The pact was endorsed at a boisterous, flag-waving rally on the west front of 
the Capitol. A band blaring patriotic music and red-white-and-blue bunting 
provided a colorful backdrop for adoption of the GOP "contract with America," 
designed to take advantage of what Republicans see as a conservative tidal wave 
that will sweep Democrats from office this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans gambled that this unprecedented attempt to unify behind a series 
of domestic issues would allow them to pick up the 40 seats they need to elect 
the House Speaker and run the chamber for the first time since 1954. Most 
independent experts predict Republicans will gain about 25 seats, narrowing the 
Democrats' current 78-seat margin but falling short of majority control. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading Democrats were quick to denounce provisions of the pact, charging that 
they would add $800 billion to the deficit and cut taxes primarily for the rich 
at the expense of Medicare and Social Security recipients. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a fraud, and I think the American people need to know that," said 
White House Chief of Staff Leon E. Panetta. White House officials have said 
that the Republican contract does not specify where all the spending cuts would 
be made to offset sweeping tax reductions of more than $100 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. David R. Obey (D-Wis.), chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, 
contended that the economic provisions in the GOP plan would be a replay of the 
higher defense spending and tax cuts advocated by President Ronald Reagan in 
1981 that led to exploding federal deficits. 
</P>
<P>
 "And now, in an incredible display of contempt for the intelligence and 
responsibility of the American people, House Republicans are betting Americans 
will have forgotten the wreckage produced by their first (Reagan) contract and 
are planning to do it all over again," Obey said. 
</P>
<P>
 House Minority Leader Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.), who developed the strategy, 
voiced confidence that voters would rally around the campaign commitments. 
"This is a first step toward renewing American civilization," Gingrich said. 
"If America fails, our children will live on a dark and bloody planet." 
</P>
<P>
 The House GOP platform includes an anti-crime package, a two-year limit for 
welfare payments and a shut-off of welfare for teen-age mothers who have 
children out of wedlock, a vote on a constitutional amendment to limit the 
number of terms lawmakers can serve and a $500 tax credit for each dependent 
child. Other provisions cover such perennial Republican goals as a reduction of 
the capital gains tax, an increase in the earnings limit for Social Security 
recipients and more tax breaks for businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said all the legislation would be voted upon within the first 100 
days if the Republicans have a majority in the House next January. Other 
changes would be made to cut House committee staffs by one-third, order an 
audit of House books, limit terms of committee chairs, forbid proxy voting in 
committee and require a three-fifths vote of the House to raise taxes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich and his allies stressed that the pact would show that their party has 
a positive agenda rather than simply opposing President Clinton's programs and 
would dramatize the contrast with Democrats seeking reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 Since opinion polls indicate that an overwhelming majority of Americans 
believe the nation is headed in the wrong direction, GOP strategists hope that 
their contract will persuade voters to put them in power in Congress with a 
mandate for coordinated change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are ready to prove that business as usual in Washington just won't do," 
said GOP House candidate Bob Moppert of New York, presenting the case for a 
balanced-budget amendment and a line-item veto. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidate Linda Smith of Washington state asked: "Don't you think your tax 
bill is too high?" 
</P>
<P>
 But Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez) said that the GOP candidates were being 
led blindfolded by Gingrich and his lieutenants. "I would hope Americans will 
read this contract before they decide whether they will sign it or not," Miller 
said on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) welcomed the Republicans' platform, which he 
said was "extremely vulnerable" to criticism. 
</P>
<P>
 GOP nominees for the House, he said, have an obligation to represent their 
district and not be put into "some kind of a steel collar contract to vote at 
the direction of the Republican leadership."

SHUTTLE CREW LAUGHS ITS WAY TO ANOTHER ATTEMPT AT LIFTOFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Frustrated by problems that have delayed their space shuttle mission, 
astronauts Tuesday turned to jokes and disguises, hoping that Friday's 
scheduled Endeavour launch succeeds. 
</P>
<P>
 Flight engineer Dan Bursch donned a Groucho Marx nose and glasses as he 
arrived in Florida.He told reporters that the rest of the crew had asked him to 
fly in disguise to ensure the shuttle gets off the ground this time. 
</P>
<P>
 The mission's first launch, set for Aug. 18, was aborted only 1.9 seconds 
before liftoff because of an engine problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "Another recommendation somebody made was, click my heels three times and say, 
'There's no place like space,' " said Bursch, the only astronaut who has 
experienced two aborted launches. He was also aboard Endeavour in August, 1993, 
when the shuttle was only able to take off after four tries. 
</P>
<P>
 NASA started a routine countdown Tuesday, a few hours after a jet carrying 
Bursch and his five crew mates landed at Kennedy. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in Earth orbit, the six astronauts will tend a pair of remote-controlled 
radars in the shuttle cargo bay and conduct a variety of small science 
experiments for 10 days.

WHEN A CLASS ASSIGNMENT BECOMES A TASK; SCHEDULES: O.C. PARENTS AND STUDENTS 
CAN GET A CHANGE DEPENDING ON THE SITUATION, SCHOOL AND PRINCIPAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BRAD BONHALL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's sometimes a tough lesson for pupils: They're free to choose their friends 
but not their classmates or teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks into the school year, the lesson is sinking in for a new round of 
elementary pupils whose best friends got assigned to different -- and, 
inevitably, more desirable -- classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is sinking in with parents left wondering how their children wound up 
in the classes they did -- why, for example, their third-grader was assigned to 
the school's only combination third- and fourth-grade class. Or why their 
well-mannered son or daughter comes home with tales of how the teacher spent a 
half-hour dealing with disruptive classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the process of forming classes is a dispassionate one -- based on 
some things as statistically simple as class size and boy/girl ratios -- the 
outcome can be a source of high emotion for pupils separated from friends or 
for parents who feel their child's future is being compromised by having the 
wrong teacher or classmates. 
</P>
<P>
 The ability of parents to influence class assignments -- ahead of time or 
after the fact -- depends on the policies of the district and individual 
principals, say Orange County educators. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the decisions about who is in what class this fall were made last 
spring, based on the recommendations of teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't call it bartering; what (we) are trying to do is get a good group 
together," says one veteran teacher in the Newport-Mesa district. 
"Personalities are very important. We also consider two kids who are explosive 
together. We try to separate little cliques that could cause problems. We try 
to get a good mix, some bright, some middle, some lower." 
</P>
<P>
 The methods of assigning pupils to classes vary by school. In many, teachers 
of one grade are responsible for forming the following year's classes in the 
next grade level. As new pupils enroll during the summer, they are added to the 
lists. 
</P>
<P>
 Do discipline problems one year mark a child for the next?  
</P>
<P>
 Not necessarily, says Debbie Derloshon, who has taught at three elementary 
schools in the Saddleback Valley district and is now a mentor for other 
teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some students who carry baggage, but we don't go back and plow 
through records. We give them a fresh start because children change so quickly 
at that age." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What can parents do if they are dissatisfied with their child's class 
assignment? First, say teachers and administrators, try to be objective about 
why it is that you are unhappy. Did your child have a bad experience with this 
teacher previously? Has your child been at odds with the other pupils in the 
class in the past? Or is it simply that your child wants to be in class with 
his or her best friend? 
</P>
<P>
 If you decide to go to the school and seek a class change for your child, you 
should have compelling reasons. Be prepared to meet with the teacher in 
question and possibly the principal at the same time. A case stated in positive 
terms rather than negative ones is likely to find a more receptive ear, several 
principals said.  
</P>
<P>
 Often, principals say, a perceived problem in the first couple weeks of school 
works itself out. The reality is, most administrators are reluctant to 
reshuffle classes. They are proud of the professionalism of their teachers and 
are confident of the methods by which assignments are made. That attitude is 
found in private as well as public schools.  
</P>
<P>
 All that is not to say that changes don't sometimes get made.  
</P>
<P>
 After a few weeks, when enrollment stabilizes, principals usually need to make 
some reassignments to keep class loads in balance. If a parent has requested a 
change, and it is compatible with the overall goals, some principals are 
receptive to honoring those requests.  
</P>
<P>
 Mimi Glueck, an elementary teacher for 30 years, the past 12 in the 
Newport-Mesa district, says that each fall a number of parents request class 
changes.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're generally told that in two weeks they probably can (make the class 
change). But what happens is that by then a lot of the concerns will be gone, 
and the children are fine" in their original class, Glueck says. 
</P>
<P>
 At some schools, such as Arovista Elementary in Brea and Stoddard in Anaheim, 
requests for teacher changes are rare. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't recall transferring a kid ever," says Arovista Principal Anne 
Flesher. "If there are problems, we first have the parent talk with the teacher 
so they know where each (is) coming from. I haven't ever had a parent come in 
and say a teacher isn't willing to hear about a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 At Stoddard, a year-round school with 1,002 pupils, parents are more apt to 
want to change one of the four schedule "tracks" their child is in than change 
the teacher, says Principal Joan Pettite, who tries to honor such requests. 
</P>
<P>
 While some parents want all their children in the school to be on the same 
track so that they have the same vacation period, others want their children in 
different tracks so the children are not all at home at the same time, Pettite 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 For parents of youngsters in schools on traditional schedules, the timing of 
requests for changes is important -- and so is patience. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult for parents who immediately approach the principal to see why 
a change can't be made," says Rich Thome, assistant superintendent for 
elementary schools at Capistrano Unified. 
</P>
<P>
 "Enrollment tends to come in slowly for the first couple of weeks, and classes 
don't get full till October. This means if kids are changed too early, it could 
overload classes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When teachers and principals begin forming classes for the following school 
year, they are trying to create classes that balance pupil learning ability, 
leadership skills, gender, reading level and ethnicity. Thus two friends who 
share many characteristics can find themselves separated, playing a similar 
balancing role in different classes. 
</P>
<P>
 At many schools, class lists are developed separately from the decision of who 
will teach the class. Later, the principal makes adjustments and assigns a 
teacher.  
</P>
<P>
 Armed with each pupil's academic and personal data on a card -- often, a pink 
card for girls and blue for boys -- the teachers work to create an equitable 
mix, looking for unique traits that balance the classes and preventing any one 
teacher from having to bear the brunt of difficult pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key word is heterogeneous," says Tim Harvey, principal at Laurel and 
Olinda elementary schools in Brea. "We want the students to blend together, so 
when they're forming the classes, the teachers keep in mind independent workers 
and those who are more of a challenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Says Jill Brick, a second-grade teacher at George White Elementary in Laguna 
Niguel: "We look at whether a child is a good leader, for instance, or has 
special talent in art or music. Or if one speaks Spanish and his friend knows 
how to translate, we try to buddy them out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had a boy with (limited mobility), so we didn't want him to be out in the 
portable (classrooms). We want to make sure he's in the building, so he doesn't 
have to walk as far," Brick recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 At some schools, such as Heninger Elementary in Santa Ana, classroom teachers 
prepare the pupil cards but the principal and resource teachers form the 
classes, using the youngsters' reading levels as a guide in creating a balance. 
</P>
<P>
 At other schools, all the school's teachers are present as classes are being 
formed. Although teachers occasionally fear the worst when they get their first 
glimpse at their class lists, horse-trading is uncommon, principals and 
teachers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "The hand you're dealt is pretty much what you take," says Derloshon of the 
Saddleback district. 
</P>
<P>
 "Teachers don't get together and say 'I'll give you my three weird guys if you 
give me your three best guys.' I'm sure it happens sometimes, but I've never 
seen it." 
</P>
<P>
 Other considerations affecting placement are the Gifted And Talented Education 
program and the need for combination classes on some campuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Some districts cluster their GATE pupils at magnet campuses in all-day classes 
while others have after-school programs or pull youngsters out of their regular 
classrooms periodically for enrichment classes. 
</P>
<P>
 When split, or combination, classes are necessary to manage class sizes, 
educators try to fill them with independent workers. An academically mature 
second-grader would be considered a better candidate for a second/third 
combination class than one who needs more teacher attention. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that the system isn't perfect and that some adjustments in 
class assignments are prudent, educators urge parents to not underestimate the 
ability of schools to create successful class groupings. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Gardner, principal at Clara Barton Elementary in Anaheim, is among those 
who doesn't buy into the idea that some parents have of "best" and "worst" 
teachers. Parents are lucky that he doesn't, he says. Otherwise, in order to be 
equitable, he'd be forced to assign kids to a poor teacher after they've had a 
good one. 
</P>
<P>
 "We officially don't honor requests, but we do allow parents to give us input 
on their child to help us determine the class," Gardner says. "But we're really 
not interested in the public's perspective on which teacher is best, medium, 
worst." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the professionalism of the teachers, principals say, that ensures the 
general workability of class groupings. 
</P>

 "The teachers know the students, which ones work well together and which ones 
will form a heterogeneous group," says Flesher at Arovista. "They're the ones 
who know best."

REGARDS TO THE PAST; NORTH VIETNAM JOURNEY BRINGS HONOR TO ANCESTORS AND HOPES 
FOR THE FUTURE

 Although my mind is full of images of North Vietnam, where my parents' lives 
began, I had never seen that forbidden region. I was born in Saigon 28 years 
ago and lived there until I was 9, when my family fled to the United States a 
week before South Vietnam's capital fell to northern forces in 1975. But 
wherever we lived -- Saigon or Phoenix -- my parents filled me with images of a 
land they loved, a place they felt forced to abandon along with 1 million 
others in 1954, when the Geneva accords gave the northern half of Vietnam to Ho 
Chi Minh's regime. I never dreamed I would visit a place ruled by my parents' 
sworn enemies. But in April, I ventured into the north of Vietnam for two weeks 
to compare it with the legends of my youth: Hanoi, with its lakes and ancient 
citadel; Hanh Thien Village, where my ancestors' shrine stands, and Chua Huong 
, or Perfume Pagoda, buried in Huong Tich Mountain. I took my first look at 
Hanoi on a ride from the Noi Bai Airport. The basic features of the city 
matched the stories I had heard. Green rice paddies gave way to narrow streets 
lined with tall trees, stately villas and bustling street vendors. 
</P>
<P>
 But unlike my parents' memories of the city, Hanoi had deteriorated. Many of 
its buildings and roads needed repair. And its homeless people drifted among 
the city's 3 million workers who earn an average of $12.50 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 My first stop was a complex of pagodas 35 miles southwest of Hanoi, built into 
the limestone cliffs of Huong Tich Mountain,, the Mountain of Fragrant Traces. 
These cliffs, named after an unexplained scent that surrounds them, have been a 
mecca for Vietnamese Buddhists for thousands of years. 
</P>
<P>
 My parents' families had been Buddhists, and a visit to the North's most 
famous shrine was supposed to have been a natural birthright. But the war had 
taken that option away from my father and mother. I was going to Huong Tich 
Mountain to reclaim that right. 
</P>
<P>
 I had first heard of the Perfume Pagoda as a high school freshman in Phoenix, 
where my family resettled. The Phoenix area had a close-knit Vietnamese 
community of about 3,000, and we organized variety shows to celebrate the most 
important Vietnamese holiday, Tet, the lunar new year. In the spring of 1981, 
when I was 15, the celebration included a dance number to a poem that had been 
put to music, "A Pilgrimage to Services at the Perfume Pagoda," about a trip by 
land and water to the shrine. 
</P>
<P>
 The pagoda it described seemed as far from the Arizona desert as the moon: 
</P>
<P>
 . . . Finally, here is the Inner Shrine  
</P>
<P>
 The cavern beneath emerald tree lines  
</P>
<P>
 Moss-covered rocks at the foot of limestones  
</P>
<P>
 The cavern soaked with falling incense smoke . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 My parents had never visited the pagoda while they lived in North Vietnam. 
They had assumed there always would be time. I thought of this during the 
two-hour car ride from my Hanoi hotel to Hoa Binh Province.  
</P>
<P>
 Before automobiles, pilgrims would hire people to carry them on hammocks along 
a dirt path. The dirt path was eventually paved, and the government only 
recently started filling its many potholes. At one point, the way was blocked 
by road workers smashing stones with hammers. Our frustrated driver stopped and 
gave the men cigarettes to speed up the work. Twenty minutes later, we were 
able to drive on, but not without some minor damage to our rented car. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Perfume River, two friends, the driver and I got into a rowboat. The 
one-hour ride downriver took us past majestic, jagged limestone formations. 
There were other boats headed to the pagoda, most carrying Vietnamese families 
wearing conical hats or shielding their faces with newspapers from the fierce 
sun. 
</P>
<P>
 At the foot of Huong Tich Mountain, our boat docked alongside hundreds of 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 The temperature was about 80 degrees with equal humidity. Carrying bottles of 
water in our backpacks and paper fans bought along the way, we began the 
two-hour hike that would take us along four miles of steep, winding dirt trail. 
</P>
<P>
 The climb was crowded with thousands of other pilgrims, vendors selling 
everything from food to incense, and beggars -- the old, the young and the lame 
-- who chanted their pleas in rhyme. 
</P>
<P>
 Just when I thought I would faint from heat exhaustion, we reached the Inner 
Shrine, the main pagoda at the top of the mountain fashioned from a natural 
cavern. 
</P>
<P>
 Before me was a flight of nearly vertical steps descending into a sea of smoke 
created by incense sticks. The rising smoke combined with falling sun rays to 
form an eerie curtain. 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the cave, which reached as high as 20 feet, hundreds of pilgrims 
surrounded the 10 scattered altars. Illumination came from candles and 
thousands of incense sticks that visitors lighted and placed in pots. 
</P>
<P>
 I worked my way through the crowd to the main altar, closed my eyes and bowed 
to Buddha, in whom my family believes but whom I abandoned long ago. 
</P>
<P>
 I didn't pray to the deity. I raised incense sticks to my forehead, smiled 
through smoke-caused tears and quietly told my ancestors: "I made it. I pay 
respects on behalf of my father, who died three years ago, and my mother, who 
hopes to come soon." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I continued my journey a couple of days later, traveling to Hanh Thien, the 
village where a temple honors my mother's side of the family. My maternal 
grandfather, born in 1909, was a member of the 13th generation of Nguyens to 
hail from this town in Nam Dinh Province, 90 miles southeast of Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 During my junior high years in Phoenix, "Hanh Thien" became familiar words in 
the house, as relatives helped people trace their roots there. They told me I 
should be proud to be descended from a native of Hanh Thien, known as the 
birthplace of scholars, many of whom became mandarins, high officials who 
advised royalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Since no one closely related to me lives there anymore, the only contact I had 
was a scholar named Nguyen Chi, but I didn't have his address. I shouldn't have 
worried. The town only has 7,000 residents and the first one I asked knew where 
to find Nguyen, a historian and retired public educator. 
</P>
<P>
 When I arrived, Nguyen was hiding from the scorching noon sun in his 
105-year-old stone house. He recognized my grandfather's name and said, "Your 
great-grandfather was my second cousin." 
</P>
<P>
 Though I interrupted his lunch, the 60-year-old man led me to the temple that 
has existed since 1611. In front of the pagoda was a cemetery with many 
headstones bearing the Nguyen name. 
</P>
<P>
 Standing among the graves, I felt lost and frustrated. Which of these belonged 
to my ancestors? Nguyen Chi didn't know. 
</P>
<P>
 He escorted me down the village's only paved road -- past farmers leading 
water buffalo to shade and children laughing in a schoolyard -- to a gate, 
through which another of my childhood legends materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 All these years I had thought the Nguyen family was honored in this village by 
a simple altar in a corner of a Buddhist pagoda. But my ancestors are 
memorialized with an entire shrine built in 1929, complete with a red altar 12 
feet high and a framed family tree detailing Hanh Thien's first 10 generations 
of Nguyens. 
</P>
<P>
 On a framed list naming descendants from overseas who had sent money to help 
with the shrine's upkeep, there were the names of my grandmother, parents and 
relatives. I laughed and told Nguyen Chi: "My family would love to see this." 
</P>
<P>
 "Bring them one October for the village's annual festival," he answered. "The 
boat races are really beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 I told him I would, and maybe then my mother and her sisters can tell me more 
about what life here was like. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 When my mother was 8 in 1948, French troops temporarily regained control of 
Hanoi and escorted her family and others from Hanh Thien to live in the city. 
My grandparents bought a piece of land, little more than an eighth of an acre, 
and built a three-story brick villa complete with a turret. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a fitting house for a couple who were among the richest merchants in 
the city. They rented out two of the floors, ran a car rental agency on the 
grounds, owned a soap factory in another part of Hanoi and sold home-grown 
water lotus to tea makers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always had money in the North," said my 86-year-old grandmother, who now 
lives in Phoenix. "That saved us, separated us from most everybody else. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of persecutions, a lot of people driven to poverty because 
their properties were taken. But we were able to bribe the right people to let 
us alone. And we made it through the hardest times," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 When my family abandoned the villa in 1954, the new communist government took 
it over and allowed squatters to live there. Even though the house has been 
divided into 50 living units, the four main rooms on the second floor have 
remained in the family. My great-aunt, 70-year-old Tuong Thi Be, has clung to 
them, even when Viet Minh officers threatened to imprison her in the late 
1950s. 
</P>
<P>
 She recounted those years of hunger and fear as she led me up a flimsy flight 
of stairs. There is electricity and plumbing, but no money to install modern 
toilets. 
</P>
<P>
 She made me lotus tea and told me I looked like my mother. 
</P>
<P>
 When I left, I was bitter that my family had lost our native land but happy 
that I had visited long-lost relatives. I began to cry, and in a city where 
residents are so reserved they don't hug, where suffering is so common people 
seldom cry, I was a strange sight. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, I went to my grandparents' soap factory, where there also was 
the home in which my mother spent the first five years of her life. My mother 
told me to look for a gate with the words "Thai Loi" on it, the names of two of 
her four brothers. They were still there. 
</P>
<P>
 My grandmother had raved about the rows of pine trees that had lined the walk 
leading from the gate to the one-story villa and pond on the grounds. But the 
trees have since been replaced by food stalls, the pond filled, and its space, 
as well as the rest of the nearly 900 square yards, had been taken over by 
renters. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of their dwellings was the size of an average bedroom in the United 
States. Residents pay about $8 a month in rent to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 Adults and children surrounded me as I stood in front of the aging villa in 
the center of the complex. It needed paint, and 10 families were living in it. 
But I was satisfied that it hadn't been destroyed. After all, I thought, Mother 
had learned to walk there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On the ride back to the motel in the pedicab, I looked hard at Hanoi. 
</P>
<P>
 The city seems drab compared to what my elders had described. But behind the 
walls of those thatched huts, single-story stone houses, storefront homes and 
villas, life has gone on -- patiently waiting for time to bring change. 
</P>
<P>
 In the future, with expected economic improvements from the lifting of the 
U.S. trade embargo against Vietnam in February, and with the possible 
normalization of relations between Washington and Hanoi, analysts are 
predicting that the region may be revived. Its best days may lie ahead, not in 
the past of my parents' memories.

R S V P / ORANGE COUNTY; AFFAIR OF STATE AIDS ALZHEIMER'S PROJECTS

 Supporters of the John Douglas French Center for Alzheimer's Disease/Friends 
of Caregivers started their own political party Sunday -- a black-tie gala held 
at the Richard Nixon Library & Birthplace in Yorba Linda. 
</P>
<P>
 Called "A Stately Affair" in honor of its location, the dinner-dance attracted 
150 supporters who put aside their political differences and remembered past 
presidents from both parties. 
</P>
<P>
 The $85-per-person gala raised about $25,000 for the organization. The support 
group offers financial assistance to family members caring for a patient with 
Alzheimer's disease, a progressive brain disorder that causes memory loss. 
State Dinner 
</P>
<P>
 Guests assembled in the library's rose garden for a champagne reception, then 
fanned out to tour the grounds and exhibits. Later they gathered inside the 
library hall and sat at tables decorated in blue and white -- presidential 
colors. 
</P>
<P>
 For dinner, the Anaheim Marriott prepared favorites from previous White House 
administrations, including: a Nixon family favorite -- salad with pineapple 
citrus dressing; a Reagan-inspired entree of filet of sole stuffed with seafood 
mousse and filet mignon with peppercorn sauce, and former First Lady Rosalynn 
Carter's apple tart. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't want this to be political, so our menu includes choices from both 
Republican and Democratic presidents," said Keath Lauderdale, event chairman. 
"After all, we're coming into an election year." 
</P>
<P>
 After dinner, guests danced the night away to Barry Cole and his orchestra. 
</P>
<P>
 "Choosing a unique location that has a theme makes it easy" to plan a benefit, 
said Lauderdale, who attended with his wife, Kathie. "Last year we had a 
fund-raiser at the Cerritos (Center for the) Performing Arts. We're hoping to 
find our niche. We're a young organization searching for our identity." 
Alzheimer's Heavy Toll 
</P>
<P>
 Friends of Caregivers, established three years ago by the John Douglas French 
Center in Los Alamitos, provides families of Alzheimer's patients with money 
for short-term respite care, in-home care and adult day care. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes the families are burned-out and can't cope anymore," said Ferri 
Kidane, founder and executive director of Friends. "Alzheimer's is a horrendous 
emotional and financial struggle for families. Patients require constant, 
around-the-clock attention. Often they are aggressive and sometimes abusive. 
They no longer resemble the person they once were." Funds are available to 
families in Los Angeles and Orange counties who apply for grants. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Friends supporters have family members who are patients. "My mother has 
had Alzheimer's for more than 12 years. She's been a patient at the center 
since it opened," said Melinda Ruddy, president of Friends. "This cause is very 
near and dear to me. Care is so expensive, and there's no insurance coverage 
for Alzheimer's. For a couple in their 80s, there's nowhere they can turn." 
</P>
<P>
 Other faces in the crowd were Callen Locket, Patricia Kates, Roberta Fratello, 
Carole and Robert Blum, Johnnie Strohmyer, Alice Jempsa, Walter Bowman and Joel 
Lowenstein. KATHRYN BOLD

HUMAN CONDITION; THOSE RANDOM ACTS OF CHEAPNESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LIZ BRODY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I often ponder the phenomenology of spending habits when I'm stuck in the 
vehicular spin cycle known as the airport shuttle. There I am, squeegeed like a 
soggy piece of laundry between a window that won't open and the 500 pounds of 
fellow passenger, circling the airport for hours. But hey, I'm heroically 
saving $6 over taking a cab. 
</P>
<P>
 This nod to the piggy bank would no doubt make more sense if I weren't equally 
capable of confusing $6 with $600 at the sight of something spellbindingly 
essential . . . say, a sequined pair of high-heeled sneakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Like most folks, I'm selectively cheap. 
</P>
<P>
 We pinch pennies on certain items the way one might pick the anchovies off 
pizza. When you factor in all the other fancies we freely dish out dough for, 
these random acts of scrimpage can seem crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The other night, after I took a friend to eat at the Westside Pavilion, we 
went to the Gap where I was appalled at the price of a shirt I wanted," says 
actor Steven Porter. 
</P>
<P>
 "My friend said, 'Steve, you just dropped $65 for a half-hour dinner and won't 
spend $38 on a shirt you'll wear for a long time?" 
</P>
<P>
 Even the material girls of the moment have their little potholes of 
stinginess. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll pay whatever it costs for a facial," says alleged Hollywood madam Heidi 
Fleiss pleasantly (when reached through her facialist, Nance Mitchell).  
</P>
<P>
 "I spend for everything -- especially clothes because they end up on your 
body," Fleiss says. ( Everything includes expensive theater seats, great food, 
first-class airline seats -- "I just can't go anywhere now" -- and, of course, 
facials. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are a few little no-can-dos in the Fleiss book of dough-re-me. 
Fast-food delivery is one. The TV Home Shopping Network -- anything off the 
tube -- is another. And parking tickets. "Usually I get so aggravated I just 
rip them to tiny shreds and throw them out, then I end up paying triple the 
amount," says Fleiss, who last week was ordered to enter a drug treatment 
center after she was arrested for testing positive for drugs. (Her mother 
attributed the test results to asthma medicine.) 
</P>
<P>
 So what lies behind this game of Selective Scrimpage? 
</P>
<P>
 "Often this kind of thing comes from the way your parents spend money," says 
psychotherapist Olivia Mellan, author of "Money Harmony" (Walker and Co., 
1994). "Basically, you're either imitating them or rebelling against them in 
very specific ways." 
</P>
<P>
 My cab chintziness comes from having grown up in Brooklyn, where taxis just 
aren't done. My dad was a subway rider who bagged taxis with potato chips: Take 
one and you'll get addicted. My mom, on the other hand, could rationalize just 
about any purchase. "Think of all the money you've saved in perms," she'd say 
as I'd demur over a pair of $250 jungle-print leggings. (Considering my hair 
looks like a cross between Richard Simmons' and Cousin Itt, she had a point.) 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone buys this Mom and Pop Theory, however. 
</P>
<P>
 "The toilet paper has nothing to do with my parents," swears Lissa Golden, a 
34-year-old real estate listings coordinator who thinks nothing of parting with 
$400 for any new motorcycle part to customize her Harley. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm in a grocery store I think, why should I buy it when I could steal 
it from a restaurant?" says Golden, who recently left Los Angeles for 
Minneapolis. "Maybe it's just a little way of reminding myself that I don't 
have to follow all the rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Barbanel, a New York City psychotherapist who specializes in money 
issues, suggests that such quirky cheapness offers a touch of security, real or 
imagined. 
</P>
<P>
 "Often people are cheap in general because they are insecure," says Barbanel, 
who just wrote "Piggy Bank to Credit Card: Teach Your Child the Financial Facts 
of Life" (Crown). "And saving a few bucks here and there makes them feel like 
they have some control . . . They feel like a survivor." 
</P>
<P>
 We can try to analyze till the cash cows come home, but some cases of 
selective cheapness ultimately defy explanation. Perhaps it's because these 
pecuniary quirks are part of the idiosyncratic nature of being human.  
</P>
<P>
 Which brings me to Nancy Gottesman, 37, who always buys the next round and, in 
fact, pretty much buys everything, especially when it can be purchased through 
a catalogue at double the store price plus shipping. Asked what she's cheap 
about, Gottesman was hard-pressed for an answer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then I bumped into her practically running to the video store clutching a copy 
of "Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't finish it, but it's almost 11:30 and I've got to return it. I don't 
want to spend $2.50 for an extra day." 
</P>
<P>
 Will she rent it again?  
</P>
<P>
 "Probably."

CHOICE DATES FOR SEASON; MUSIC: PHILHARMONIC SOCIETY'S '95 RECITALS WILL 
FEATURE SOPRANO CECILIA BARTOLI IN HER O.C. DEBUT AND VIOLINIST ITZHAK PERLMAN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Exciting young coloratura mezzo-soprano Cecilia Bartoli, hailed almost 
universally as proof that the golden age of singing is not dead, will make her 
Orange County debut next year as part of an expanded Philharmonic Society 
season for 1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
 Society officials also announced that they will bring violinist Itzhak Perlman 
back to the county for a recital. Both programs will take place at the Orange 
County Performing Arts Center in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 The rest of the season will be announced over the next several months. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were incredibly lucky to get her," society Executive Director Dean Corey 
said Tuesday of Bartoli, 27, who will sing on Sept. 21, 1995. "She had only one 
date open. I went ahead, even though I wasn't even sure I could get the hall. I 
said I'd find a hall some place. Lo and behold, we got the center. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had thought about the Irvine Barclay and charging a high ticket price, but 
I decided we should have her for her first time here where as many people as 
possible could hear her." 
</P>
<P>
 A native of Rome, Bartoli was born to parents who both sang in the Rome Opera 
chorus. Her mother, who sang under the name Silvana Bazzoni, became her first 
and only voice teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Bartoli made her opera debut at age 9 as the offstage shepherd in the last act 
of Puccini's "Tosca" for the Rome Opera. She then took a rebellious teen-age 
detour for a few years, studying and performing flamenco dance, but returned to 
music, enrolling for special classes at the Academy of Santa Cecilia in Rome 
when she was 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Her career got a major boost three years later when she was introduced by 
opera stars Katia Riciarelli and Leo Nucci on an Italian television program. 
Shortly afterward, she was engaged by conductors Daniel Barenboim and Herbert 
von Karajan. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequently, she made her operatic debuts at La Scala, Le Bastille Opera in 
Paris, the Liceo in Barcelona and the Maggio Musicale in Florence, as well as 
concert appearances in major international cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Her "If You Love Me" album, a collection of Arie antiche or 18th-Century 
Italian love songs , was at the top of the Billboard classical charts for 
months. Several other Bartoli albums have cracked the Top 20. 
</P>
<P>
 Reviewing a collection of Mozart concert arias, with pianist Andras Schiff and 
the Vienna Kammerorchester led by Gyorgy Fischer, Times music critic Martin 
Bernheimer wrote: "If Bartoli sounds on the stage as she does on this record, 
she must be one of the most formidable stylists and one of the most virtuosic 
technicians of our time." 
</P>
<P>
 Resisting typecasting, Bartoli is scheduled to make her Metropolitan Opera 
debut in January, 1996, as a soprano, singing Despina in Mozart's "Cosi fan 
tutte." She has sung Zerlina, another soprano role, in Mozart's "Don Giovanni" 
at La Scala in Milan. 
</P>
<P>
 Perlman, who will play about a month after Bartoli (Oct. 18, 1995), is one of 
the best-known and most widely admired violinists of his generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Israel in 1945, he was stricken by poliomyelitis when he was 4, lost 
the use of his legs and to this day must walk on crutches. His interest in the 
violin dates from his period of convalescing. 
</P>
<P>
 He began violin studies at the Academy of Music in Tel Aviv and continued with 
famed pedagogues Dorothy DeLay and Ivan Galamian at the Juilliard School in New 
York. He won the prestigious Leventritt Competition in 1964 and has appeared 
with virtually every major orchestra in the world. His discography is 
extensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had appeared with several orchestras in the county, Perlman didn't 
make his Orange County recital debut until 1991 in a program sponsored by the

 One of four trucks carrying a set for Verdi's "Aida" from San Francisco to 
Opera Pacific in Orange County was stolen from a parking lot in Ontario 
sometime Saturday night, Opera Pacific officials said Tuesday. The show -- 
scheduled to open this weekend at the Orange County Performing Arts Center in 
Costa Mesa -- will go on, according to officials of the opera company who are 
trying to obtain scenery from other troupes and who say they already have made 
some changes in their staging to accommodate the loss.The truck and its 
contents were insured. Opera Pacific is asking the public to help look for the 
48-foot vehicle: The cab had Oregon license plate YABW949 and the trailer had 
Oregon license plate HP40153. There is a $2,500 reward for the return of the 
scenery. Call Interstate Consolidation at (213) 720-1771 with information.

 A folk concert sponsored by the Orange Coast Unitarian Universalist Church in 
Costa Mesa Saturday raised $1,300 for the AIDS Team Ministry, according to 
spokesperson Dorothy White. The ministry, operated by the church and by the 
Metropolitan Community Church, also in Costa Mesa, provides meals to homebound 
people with AIDS and is the only such program in Orange County; it prepares and 
delivers 360 meals per month. Performers at the concert included Guy Richard, 
Tom Sanders, Barbara McGraw and Canton and Rhiannon Clannach.

'HOME' LEADS WAY AS ABC MUSCLES OUT COMPETITION; TELEVISION: NETWORK PLACES SIX 
SHOWS IN TOP 10, BUT NBC STRENGTHENS ITS LINEUP WITH ITS GO-FOR-BROKE TUESDAY 
STRATEGY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 ABC's "Home Improvement," seemingly impregnable, not only trounced NBC's 
"Frasier" in their highly touted first matchup but also remained the nation's 
most popular television series, according to ratings released Tuesday for the 
premiere week of the 1994-95 season. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, two episodes of "Home Improvement," one of them a special outing, 
ranked in the top six shows. "Frasier," however, still finished a respectable 
16th among 92 prime-time network programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In another closely watched matchup, NBC's "ER" walloped CBS' "Chicago Hope" in 
a battle of new medical dramas on Thursday. "ER" ranked 12th for the week in 
total TV homes in this confrontation, while "Chicago Hope" was 46th. 
</P>
<P>
 However, David E. Kelley, creator of "Chicago Hope," may finally be seeing 
light for his other CBS series, "Picket Fences," which apparently benefited 
from its recent, second consecutive Emmy Award as best drama series. It came in 
42nd -- attracting 21% of the television audience -- compared to its 66th-place 
final ranking for last season. 
</P>
<P>
 A two-hour preview of "ER" on Monday came in seventh -- but other than that, 
no new series made the Top 10. ABC's new sitcom, "Me and the Boys," about a 
widower with three young sons, ranked 11th. 
</P>
<P>
 For CBS, winner of the prime-time ratings race the last three seasons, it was 
ana inauspicious third-place start. Onrushing ABC, propelled by its Tuesday 
tandem of "Home Improvement" and "Grace Under Fire" and its Wednesday pairing 
of "Roseanne" and "Ellen," was No. 1, with six of the Top 10 series. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC averaged a 12.6 rating and 21% audience share. But longtime doormat NBC 
was a surprisingly strong No. 2 with a 12.3 rating and 20 share as it 
succeeded, at least in premiere week, with its attempt to build a new 
competitive night by switching "Frasier" and "Wings" to Tuesdays. (Each rating 
point represents 954,000 homes.) 
</P>
<P>
 NBC already fares well on Thursdays -- and now may have added firepower on 
that night with "ER" in the 10-11 slot, where it replaced the canceled "L.A. 
Law." Another NBC Thursday entry, "Seinfeld," was the nation's No. 2 show. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS also tried to crow a little, saying all seven of its new series "exceeded 
the network's time period performance in the fourth quarter of 1993." But the 
hard fact was that CBS was No. 3, with an 11.6 rating and 19% viewer share. It 
was also down 14% over last season's premiere week rating -- while all the 
other networks were up, mainly NBC, which jumped 11%. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, CBS was last among the four networks -- including Fox -- in 
drawing viewers 18 to 49 years of age -- the advertisers' favorite target. It 
also finished third in total viewers, and CBS confirmed it was the network's 
lowest-rated premiere week since at least 1962. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, meanwhile, is getting audience response to what previously was a cult 
favorite, "The X-Files," in which two FBI agents investigate unsolved cases, 
many of which may involve the paranormal. It finished 59th but drew a 
reasonable 17% of viewers, compared with last season's final ranking in 111th 
place with 11% of the audience. 
</P>
<P>
 On the loss side, Fox went into the dumper with "Fortune Hunter," the early 
Sunday-night series it expected to cash in as the follow-up, in much of the 
country, to the network's new slate of National Football League games that it 
won away from CBS. "Fortune Hunter," an adventure series, was dead last among 
all of the week's shows. 
</P>
<P>
 In the first week, at least, NBC had much to brag about, mostly its gamble of 
going for broke on Tuesdays. Its two-hour comedy block on that night -- 
"Wings," "The Martin Short Show," "Frasier" and "The John Larroquette Show" -- 
all recorded substantial ratings gains over shows in the comparable time 
periods last season. 
</P>
<P>
 NBC also claimed nine of the Top 20 series: "Seinfeld," "ER," the Sunday- and 
Monday-night movies, "Mad About You," "Frasier," "Law & Order," "Friends" -- a 
new entry about a group of young adults trying to succeed in Manhattan -- and 
"Madman of the People," starring Dabney Coleman as an irascible columnist 
working for his daughter at a magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 However, "Madman of the People," despite getting the coveted post-"Seinfeld" 
time slot, lost a large amount of the audience it inherited. "Seinfeld" had a 
robust 33% audience share, while "Madman" dropped off to 24%. 
</P>
<P>
 While the networks were boasting about their premiere-week showings, another 
hard fact was that the Big Three -- ABC, CBS and NBC -- still totaled only 60% 
of the TV audience, which has found alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other new series, NBC's "The Cosby Mysteries," a drama with Bill Cosby 
as a crime-solver, did well, ranking 27th; ABC's "All-American Girl," a sitcom 
starring Margaret Cho as a young woman in a Korean-American family, was 52nd; 
and two other new Fox series, "M.A.N.T.I.S.," an adventure show, and "Wild 
Oats," about sex-obsessed twentysomethings, had the dubious honor of finishing 
near the bottom of the ratings with "Fortune Hunter."

 Fox wisely agreed to postpone its O.J. Simpson movie until after the selection 
of jurors for his double-homicide trial, a process that began only Monday. Yet 
that very evening, CBS comedies "Murphy Brown" and "Love & War" went forward 
with their combined hourlong satire of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Was this irresponsible, risking further tainting of potential jurors? 
</P>
<P>
 "Our little story about an astronaut and his brother isn't going to influence 
anybody," writer-producer Diane English said earlier Monday in a TV interview 
about her back-to-back series' merged plot that night, in which a celebrity 
suspected of murder takes flight from police on the New Jersey Turnpike. 
</P>
<P>
 Wrong. This was an outrageous miscarriage of sitcom justice. There was no 
perspective here, no balance, no intent to be objective, no attempt to grant 
equal time to the accused. Instead, this was a clear indictment, one that 
resonated across the airwaves and reached millions and millions of Americans. 
Call out the lynch mobs. No one who watched Monday night could have any doubt 
whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 About the guilt of the media. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, you'd have to say the target asked for it, that the 
evidence here against the media, cited in the best tradition of spoofing, was 
not only persuasive but also overpowering. As was the sense of deja vu , a 
reminder of how the line separating parody and self-parody -- the latter term 
applicable to much of this case's TV coverage -- is barely discernible. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, NBC's "Seinfeld" also will deal comedically with the Simpson 
pursuit. But it's increasingly difficult these days to tell the spoof from the 
reality. The commercial break between Monday's "Murphy Brown" and "Love & War," 
for example, included a titillating promo from KCBS-TV Channel 2 for its 11 
p.m. news -- "Insiders tell what went on behind closed doors!" -- that gave a 
somewhat gossipy tone to the first day of jury selection for the Simpson trial. 
</P>
<P>
 O.J.-related lore proliferates throughout television. Yet, on Monday, Channel 
2's broadcast day was particularly laden with the stuff, from its early and 
late newscasts to "The CBS Evening News," which led with the juror selection. 
Elsewhere on Channel 2, the syndicated "Hard Copy" exposed the side of Deputy 
Dist. Atty. Marcia Clark "you don't see," and "Entertainment Tonight" had Bob 
Goen covering the media crush for the first day of jury selection. 
</P>
<P>
 Goen incorrectly stated that only one reporter would be allowed to witness the 
jury selection process (three are being allowed in), an excusable gaffe given 
that his main experience on television has been as a game show host. 
</P>
<P>
 A game show host assigned a portion of the Simpson beat? That seems to be a 
metaphor for at least some of the coverage, as TV reporters increasingly report 
condescendingly on the media circus outside the courthouse, conveniently 
forgetting that they are part of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murphy Brown" ridiculed the center ring. The Simpson surrogate in 
co-executive producer Michael Saltzman's funny script was a heroic astronaut 
named Duke Robinson. The murder of his brother caused the "FYI" office to 
ripple with rumors. Was it was a Mob hit? A KGB hit? 
</P>
<P>
 When Duke himself became the suspect, Murphy's news colleagues whipped 
themselves into a frenzy that shortly assumed a life of its own, as has the 
media frenzy in the Simpson case. So bring on the marathon live coverage that 
will set an agenda for the nation, focusing so acutely on the case that 
Americans will think of little else. In other words, the media inflate the 
story, building interest, then use their own creation as justification for 
relentless overwrought coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "Murphy, Jim, you're anchoring in the studio," gasped Miles Silverberg, 
"FYI's" hyperventilating executive producer. "Oh, God, this is so great!" 
</P>
<P>
 Familiarity threaded the entire episode. Adding to the theater, the "FYI" 
coverage immediately earned a theatrical title: "Lost Astronaut." Naturally, 
there was gratuitous live coverage, with Frank Fontana posted outside police 
headquarters, where Duke was to turn himself in. "What's the mood like there?" 
Jim, the anchor, asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, nothing was happening but the coverage. So bring in the 
meaningless, unseen-by-anyone raw footage . . . of a fire hydrant . . . of 
trash cans . . . of a dog. Jim: "A golden retriever, wouldn't you say?" 
</P>
<P>
 Frank couldn't say anything, because there was nothing to report. So anchors 
Jim and Murphy nervously shuffled their papers, live. And with time to fill and 
nothing to fill it with, there was reporter Corky Sherwood outside the victim's 
"fateful apartment," wondering about the contents of a mysterious paper sack 
brought out by police. It turned out to be coffee and doughnuts. And there she 
was interviewing groupies and various loonies to pad the minutes. And there she 
was later, live, getting the lowdown at the gas station where Duke always 
filled up. 
</P>
<P>
 The only skeptic here was Murphy. But her urgings to "hit the pause button" 
and stop covering Duke like a convicted murderer were rejected by Miles. "Hey, 
we do this all the time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, Duke failed to show up at either police headquarters or his 
"historic townhouse," but instead was located on the turnpike in a white van 
trailed by police, with TV capturing it all live.  
</P>
<P>
 The "Love & War" episode, written by Shannon Gaughan, picked up the story from 
there, with nearly everyone in the Blue Shamrock transfixed by the chase 
coverage on the bar's TV set. "Let's flip around and see who's got the best 
copter shot," Jack said. "Hold it, hold it, he's changing lanes!" someone else 
shouted. 
</P>
<P>
 As Duke's van headed for the Statue of Liberty that he wanted to see "one last 
time," rumors swept the restaurant. "They found half a tuna sandwich at the 
crime scene, the other half at Duke's house," Meg said. When the chase ended 
peacefully, without bloodshed, the revved-up viewers in the Blue Shamrock were 
deflated, as if wanting a more rousing climax. 
</P>
<P>
 The episode was a humorous slap not only at the public's prurient interest but 
also at the media's feeding of that interest. At one point, a waitress told a 
TV news producer who had come into the bar an unsubstantiated story about the 
case and, without verifying it, he called it in to a reporter on the air, who 
then repeated it as fact. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors? Innuendo? As Miles would say, hey, they do it all the time.

ARTS PANEL KILLS PROPOSALS SEEKING FUNDING CHANGES; GRANTS: L.A. COUNTY MUSIC 
AND PERFORMING ARTS COMMISSION REJECTS PROPOSALS TO REDIRECT MONEY TO 
COMMUNITY-ORIENTED GROUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a protracted and contentious meeting, the Los Angeles County Music and 
Performing Arts Commission on Monday narrowly defeated proposals that would 
have redistributed funds for its 1994-95 organizational grant recommendations. 
The vote was described by a disappointed commission president Carlos C. Barron 
as "business as usual." 
</P>
<P>
 At the group's last meeting in August, Barron and several other commissioners 
sought to revamp a funding pattern that has traditionally sent more than half 
of the commission's $366,000 grant allocation to the Music Center's resident 
companies: the Los Angeles Philharmonic, the Music Center Opera and the Center 
Theatre Group. Their proposals included a suggestion to reduce the Philharmonic 
allocation from $124,805 for 1993-94 to as little as $26,700 for 1994-95. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a similar proposal to redirect the funds to smaller, 
community-oriented groups did not pass, following a vote of 7 in favor, 7 
against, with one abstention. 
</P>
<P>
 Meeting in a Dorothy Chandler Pavilion boardroom crowded with nearly 30 
representatives from local arts organizations, the 15-member commission 
considered several compromise proposals before passing its final 
recommendations on an 8 to 7 vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The recommendation, which still must be approved by the Board of Supervisors, 
which appointed the commission, includes a cut of nearly $15,000 from the 
Philharmonic's 1993-'94 allocation, bringing its proposed 1994-95 
recommendation to $110,000 -- still nearly one-third of the total funds 
allocated. 
</P>
<P>
 Grants to the Music Center Opera and the Center Theatre Group also will be 
reduced by $1,300 and $1,258 respectively. (The Music Center also receives a 
separate appropriation of $7,658,000 from the county for operation and 
maintenance.) In addition, grants of $5,500 each will go to seven groups that 
have not previously received commission money, including the Craft and Folk Art 
Museum, Performing Tree, Armory Center for the Arts, Cornerstone Theatre, Young 
Musicians' Foundation and Beyond Baroque. 
</P>
<P>
 Criticism of the process by which the commission determines funding levels was 
also raised at Monday's meeting. Unlike other public arts organizations such as 
the National Endowment for the Arts and the California Arts Council, the county 
commission does not call upon expert testimony or peer review panels for its 
evaluation of grantee's applications. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Adrienne A. Hall, an appointee of Supervisor Gloria Molina, 
likened the current process to "throwing darts at a dartboard." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a formula," added commissioner Aurelia Brooks, an appointee of 
Supervisor Yvonne Braithwaite Burke. "It is not fair. There is no level playing 
field." 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners are scheduled to meet on a retreat in November, during which 
they will discuss revised guidelines for the organizational grant program for 
1995-96. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be an equitable process that adds more people to the granting 
process and that was defeated today," said Barron, a Molina appointee. "It was 
close. We made headway. But there's a lot of the arts world that is not 
represented here."

VALLEY BRIEFING: MAKING THE GRADE; ROUNDUP OF LOCAL SAT RESULTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though surrounded by controversy, the Scholastic Assessment Test--formerly 
called the Scholastic Aptitude Test--continues to be one of the most 
influential factors in determining who gets into four-year colleges and 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
 The exam includes two sections: a verbal portion that tests reading and 
vocabulary skills and a math component concentrating on arithmetic, algebra and 
geometry. 
</P>
<P>
 The test has been retooled to reflect a shift toward critical reading and away 
from the multiple-choice format that has been a staple since the SAT was 
introduced in 1926. The new test also includes some "grid-in" questions on the 
math portion, which require test-takers to come up with their own responses 
instead of choosing from several choices. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall scores in the Los Angeles Unified School District declined for the 
fifth consecutive year, although most students at San Fernando Valley schools 
do better than their urban counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Nuys High School was the highest-ranked Los Angeles Unified school in the 
San Fernando Valley, with average scores of 473 on the verbal section and 556 
in math. (A perfect scores is 800 in either section.) 
</P>
<P>
 Student scores in the Antelope, Conejo and Santa Clarita valleys are generally 
higher than in Los Angeles Unified.
