FLEISS DEFENSE LAWYERS CALL UNDERCOVER OFFICER TO STAND; COURTS: ATTORNEYS TRY 
TO PROVE ENTRAPMENT OF THE ALLEGED HOLLYWOOD MADAM. THE SURVEILLANCE VIDEOTAPE 
IS SHOWN.

<P>
 Heidi Fleiss' attorneys called an undercover police officer to the stand 
Monday as they launched a defense focusing on entrapment. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Anthony Brooklier also showed jurors a surveillance videotape made as 
part of an undercover operation that led to the indictment of the alleged 
Hollywood madam.Part of the tape was shown in the prosecution case. 
</P>
<P>
 Undercover officer Sammy Lee is shown on the video with Samantha Burdette, a 
prostitute who has testified that she was sent to Lee's hotel suite by Fleiss. 
She said she was to give 40% of her $1,500 sex fee to Fleiss. 
</P>
<P>
 "This whole thing was a setup, correct?" Brooklier asked Lee about the June 8, 
1993, sting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Correct," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was all arranged with the people in the next room?" Brooklier asked, 
referring to the operatives assisting Lee in the sting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Correct," Lee said. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, Brooklier asked Lee why he needed to hide a video camera in the 
bedroom, where Burdette disrobed after Lee asked her to remove her clothes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time you have a vice operation," Lee said, "the videotape is good both as 
evidence and regarding the conduct of the officer." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter called four witnesses, including Lee, in his 
prosecution case. Carter rested his case Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss is charged with five counts of pandering for procuring four women for 
prostitution. In addition to Burdette's June 8 visit to Lee's hotel suite, 
Fleiss was charged with sending Burdette and three other women the next 
evening. They were sent to have sex with three Asian "businessmen" who were 
actually police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss also faces a related narcotics charge. She faces a maximum penalty of 
11 years. 
</P>
<P>
 She and her father, pediatrician Paul Fleiss, were also charged under federal 
indictment with money laundering in a related case.

AL MARTINEZ: PLEASE PASS THE ART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I went in search of the meaning of art Saturday and found it in a Santa Monica 
gallery. Art is a mound of rotting cantaloupes on the floor. Art is a machine 
you blow into that lights up and belches. Art is a collage of blobs painted 
with chocolate. 
</P>
<P>
 I know I once said that art was a hundred used tires piled in the entryway of 
L.A.'s Convention Center by a famous Japanese artist. But that was yesterday's 
definition. This season, art is related to food and, like food, is transitory 
in nature. You can't have your art and eat it too. 
</P>
<P>
 This was manifested in a place called the New Gallery at the 18th Street Arts 
Complex in an exhibit titled "The Rite to Eat." It consists of the work of 11 
artists whose subject, medium or context is something you might serve to good 
friends, or possibly to the family dog. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not an easy exhibit to stage, according to its curator, Barbara 
Smith. Neighbors complained because the canvas painted with chocolate drew 
flies, the cantaloupes rotted and smelled up the place, and mounds of wheat 
grass caused allergies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got rid of the cantaloupes and some of the wheat grass," she said. "Then 
we bug-bombed the place and ended up with hundreds of flies on the floor. It 
was a mess." 
</P>
<P>
 They missed an opportunity. I'd have swept the dead flies into a pile, sprayed 
them with a glazing solution, labeled the creation "Flies After a Feast" and 
sold it to a Beverly Hills collector for $3,600. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After the show, we adjourned to the Electronic Cafe, a kind of New Age 
coffeehouse across from the gallery, and met with some of the, well, artists, I 
guess you'd call them. 
</P>
<P>
 As we entered, my wife, Cinelli, whispered, "When you write about them, and I 
know you will, be kind," as though that was even a remote possibility in the 
company of those who see the creation of life in a bowl of noodles. 
</P>
<P>
 I mean, I have eaten a lot of noodles in a lot of places from elegant joints 
like Gaetano's in Calabasas to celebrity hangouts like Chin Chin's on Sunset, 
but never, not once, have I seen human life swirling about in the sauce. Laurel 
Paley does. 
</P>
<P>
 She is a self-described nice Jewish girl from Racine, Wis., who has grown up 
with the ability to visualize procreation in a plate of linguine. Paley's 
contribution to the show was a canvas painted partly with coffee called 
"Original Ramen." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not far from the machine that lit up and belched. That was called, 
appropriately, "Pardon Me." Thank God it was limited to belching. 
</P>
<P>
 The title "Original Ramen," describing a mass of swirling pasta, is from 
original sin, Paley explained. "If you look closely you can see a woman's entry 
point. That winding thing is a man." 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't remember seeing that," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a surprise," Cinelli said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The painting is a metaphor for humanity," Paley explained. "Noodles are moist 
and clingy, the way people are. They flop around and stick to each other. 
They're funny that way." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always found them amusing," I said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cinelli sighed. "We've come a long way from Botticelli," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As we discussed art, a woman next to us, later identified as Pauline Oliveros, 
spent the time waving her hands on either side of another woman's head in a 
slow and rhythmical manner. 
</P>
<P>
 As Smith explained how true art, such as a piece of bread and some red 
feathers in a fishbowl, must pour from an artist's soul, Oliveros withdrew 
something invisible from her patient's head and dashed it on the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 This was repeated several times until I asked what she was doing. She 
explained it was an ancient Chinese healing technique based on meditation and 
an understanding of the body's energy flow. 
</P>
<P>
 The "patient" was suffering pain in her mandible, which Oliveros was relieving 
by withdrawing the, well, evil vapors and discarding them on the floor. Think 
of Bernadette and the miracle at Lourdes and the picture will clarify itself. 
</P>
<P>
 Oliveros offered to cure a cold that had been clinging for a week, but I 
thanked her and said I would stay with Tylenol. She might have mistakenly 
withdrawn evil vapors I needed for writing and destroyed my career. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is performance art," Smith was explaining about the show. "It's where 
you have an intense experience around an event, and then it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 She paused as Oliveros resumed her rhythmical hand-waving around her patient's 
mandible. "Our next show is about death," Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows? A cemetery created in a steaming plate of spaghetti puttanesca, 
pouring like marinara from its creator's soul, may be the ultimate art form. 
Hold the Parmesan.

NIZAM OF HYDERABAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Regarding "Battle Royal Still Rages Over a True Gem of a Collection," Nov. 5: 
</P>
<P>
 The Nizam of Hyderabad was perhaps the richest man of his time. He was frugal 
in his own person, but to say he was a rich miser who smoked leftover cigarette 
butts makes an impression. 
</P>
<P>
 The Nizam was generous in ways that counted. He established the first 
university in India which imparted education in all disciplines at the highest 
level in a local language -- Urdu. He endowed educational institutions all over 
India such as the Hindu University of Benares and the Muslim University of 
Aligarh. All religions were respected. He endowed and aided Christian and Sikh 
institutions in Hyderabad. In Hyderabad there was a public education system. 
</P>
<P>
 He established a bureau of translation which translated books into Urdu as 
they hit the press all over the world. He built subsidized and free housing for 
the poor. There were too many things he did for his subjects to be recounted 
here. Hyderabadis all over the world will attest to the generosity and vision 
of the Nizam of Hyderabad. I am one of those.

DE LA TORRE, NAVARRETTE ON 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Many a Slip 'Twixt Passage and Enforcement," Commentary, Nov. 16: 
</P>
<P>
 The intellectually dishonest attempt by Adela de la Torre to propagandize the 
issue of Prop. 187 was shown by her choice of the word "immigrant" instead of 
the correct term "illegal immigrant." Citing actions of the Nazis to stigmatize 
Prop. 187 proponents is extremely offensive and morally bankrupt. De la Torre 
characterizes Prop. 187 as "immigration reform"; it has nothing to do with 
immigration reform, but is an attempt to prevent illegal activities and limit 
the damage caused by those illegal activities. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the most destructive part of the commentary is her attempt to 
racialize the issue. We are told that when "Anglo voters . . . cross ethnic 
lines to vote for Latinos" this is a phenomenon that reflects "the real 
political revolution," but that "the white electorate" (presumably simply by 
voting for Anglo candidates) "still determines the political fate of many 
Latinos, African Americans, and others disenfranchised from our political 
system." It is sadly obvious who is trying to play the race card and divide the 
state.

</P>
<P>
 * The piece from Ruben Navarrette Jr., "At the Birth of a New -- and Younger 
-- Latino Activism" (Nov. 13), was unfortunately nothing new from activists of 
his stripe. Instead of attempting to understand the meaning of the Nov. 8 
election (specifically the Prop. 187 vote), Navarrette chooses to ignore 
possible shortcomings in current Latino positions on the issues affecting this 
segment of the population. For Navarrette, the fault of 187's passage lies in 
not having enough soldiers to vote the "right" way. I beg to differ. 
</P>
<P>
 While I applaud the prospect of increased Latino political participation, 
continued alliance and reliance on more government programs to create 
opportunity may prevent this movement from generating the credibility it so 
eagerly craves. Government's attempts to remedy the plight of urban, ethnic 
constituencies have failed over the last 40 years. The thought of securing 
political clout in order to re-travel this path seems nonsensical. But liberal 
leaders and scholars, like Navarrette, never get the message. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, I suggest Latino leaders promote private-sector solutions, individual 
empowerment and less reliance on the government (from all levels), to pursue 
the real meaning of the American Dream. 
</P>
<P>
 The path of separatism, long the chosen route for many Latinos, has not gotten 
our people anywhere. True economic and cultural respect can only be gained by 
working within the societal framework, not by the incessant drumbeats of how we 
are different.

CENTRISTS AND EXTREMISTS

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If we put aside all of the malarkey that is and has been generated in every 
political region on this Earth, the only chance we have for a recovery to a 
prosperous and civil American nation is to reject the extremists of either end 
of the belief spectrum and to form a strong centrist coalition of 
middle-of-the-roaders, moderate conservatives and liberals. 
</P>
<P>
 When these groups do not realize the need to join into strong collegial 
bonding, the extremists can always manage to pull the system apart. Centrists 
waste their energies in trying to argue with extreme ideologues. End of

TWICE AS MUCH 'SUNSHINE' IN LOS ANGELES; REPORT ON CITY COUNCIL SPECIAL FUND 
SHOULD BE PUBLISHED QUARTERLY, NOT TWICE A YEAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council retains a block of discretionary funds allowing 
its members to pay for office supplies or office activities that enhance public 
service. From the sound of it, taxpayers might infer the money would be used 
for such necessities as pencils and erasers, perhaps even computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Angelenos will be astonished to learn of some of the creative uses of 
these so-called officeholder expense funds. They include a $318 dinner at 
Chuck's Steak House on Maui, a $415 trip to Caesars Palace in Las Vegas and 
$3,268 season tickets to the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the money in the fund comes from private donations, surely expensive 
trips and dinners were not the kind of constituency service most of us had in 
mind when we chose our public servants. Sounds more like a personal slush fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, the City Council has come to its senses on this matter by 
agreeing in principle to adopt a city Ethics Commission proposal giving the 
public a clearer and more detailed picture of source and destination of these 
private officeholder funds in exchange for lifting fund-raising limits to 
$75,000 from $25,000. Now the only sticking point is how often reports will be 
issued. 
</P>
<P>
 The council wants twice-a-year reports along the lines of the state standards. 
The city Ethics Commission favors quarterly reporting. That may not sound like 
much of a difference, but a six-month period is excessive, given the public's 
need for timely and meaningful disclosure. 
</P>
<P>
 Open and accountable government is the cornerstone of democracy. If Los 
Angeles is to have such a government, and we think it must, the City Council 
needs to do its part by voting for the maximum frequency of disclosure. If the 
council is game to disclose twice a year, why not go for the whole reform and 
let the sun shine in every three months?

PROPOSITION 187: ONE IS MORE THAN ENOUGH; UNFORTUNATELY, WILSON SAYS HE WILL 
SEEK A FEDERAL VERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One of the election's biggest winners -- Gov. Pete Wilson -- now sees an 
opportunity to push Congress toward a federal version of California's 
controversial Proposition 187, which would deny all benefits except emergency 
medical care to illegal immigrants. For several reasons, we hope that no one 
takes the advice. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a fellow who stands to be one of the election's biggest losers 
(although he still refuses to admit defeat) is also still greatly concerned 
about illegal immigrants. Republican Rep. Mike Huffington says he won't concede 
the Senate race to incumbent Dianne Feinstein until an investigation has 
determined "that Mrs. Feinstein has received a majority of legal votes." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington also said, "I have become very concerned about whether massive 
voting irregularities (by non-citizens) played a critical part in affecting 
this election outcome" and that he has received "substantial, credible 
evidence" of "large numbers of non-citizens voting as a result of a 
mobilization effort against Proposition 187." 
</P>
<P>
 By this, we suppose he is referring to the army of illegal voters who turned 
out to send Proposition 187 and its supporters, such as fellow Republicans Gov. 
Wilson and Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, down to resounding Election Day defeats. 
Yes, this is heavy sarcasm. 
</P>
<P>
 WHERE'S THE PROOF?: We haven't a clue as to what Huffington and others who see 
vote fraud are referring to, since Proposition 187 won 59% to 41%, Wilson won 
reelection 55% to 41% and Lungren won 54% to 39%. At last count, Huffington was 
losing by about 152,000 votes with only 180,000 left to consider. His statement 
about massive vote fraud now threatens to lower California politics to new 
depths on the sour-grapes scale. Last week, a Los Angeles Superior Court judge 
rejected a legal challenge by Republicans who alleged that illegal immigrants 
and children had cast absentee ballots. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's post-election buoyancy is understandable, but his push to elevate 
Proposition 187 to the national stage is unfortunate. The governor even says he 
would work with states interested in passing laws similar to Proposition 187, 
in addition to his lobbying of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an effort on Capitol Hill would be wholly premature, and a waste of 
precious time. First, most of 187's provisions have been temporarily blocked by 
a federal judge pending further review by the courts on constitutional and 
other legal grounds. Also, illegal immigrants are already ineligible for 
welfare and food stamps. Congress has required states to provide emergency 
medical care to illegal immigrants, but Proposition 187 leaves this 
undisturbed. 
</P>
<P>
 A 'MINOR' BARRIER: And any effort to remove illegal immigrants from schools 
nationwide faces the same hurdle that Proposition 187 has not cleared: the 1982 
Supreme Court ruling requiring states to educate illegal aliens. There is also 
the question of whether it violates the federal Family Education Rights and 
Privacy Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), likely to be the next chairman of the House 
judiciary subcommittee on immigration, says that "most of us are more 
interested in passing a bill than in posturing, and that means producing a bill 
that has bipartisan support in Congress." Any provision cutting off educational 
benefits for children, Smith said, "would make it difficult" to attract such 
broad support. 
</P>
<P>
 Former GOP Cabinet secretaries Jack Kemp and William J. Bennett on Monday 
continued to downplay Proposition 187, saying it was not a formula for solving 
illegal immigration. Bennett said Wilson's posture on 187 is "scapegoating" and 
called the measure only "superficially attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 It's at least clear that it would be rash to duplicate Proposition 187 at a 
time when its legal standing is so very much in doubt.

DID SOMETHING ACTUALLY GO RIGHT?; CLINTON'S HAITI POLICY IS LOOKING 
SUSPICIOUSLY LIKE A WINNER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Haiti is no Somalia. The U.S. invasion of the Caribbean nation is going much 
better than expected. There have been no massacres of American troops, no 
Americans held hostage, no U.S. planes filled with body bags headed home to 
grieving spouses, children and parents, none of the doom and gloom that had 
been predicted so ominously. Things still could go sour, but at the moment the 
policy and its execution must be considered a triumph for the Clinton 
Administration and the U.S. military. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton should visit the troops, particularly those suffering from 
poor morale, to personally thank them for the sacrifices that they -- and their 
loved ones -- are making. 
</P>
<P>
 While 16,000 American troops keep order, Haiti's President Jean-Bertrand 
Aristide continues to make progress -- albeit slowly -- toward restoring 
democratic institutions. U.S. troops have helped immensely by putting a stop to 
the political killings, and Aristide recently appointed a new commander in 
chief, Bernardin Poisson, who trained in the United States and France. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course the worry is whether Poisson can control the soldiers who ousted 
Aristide, propped up the illicit rule of Gen. Raoul Cedras and killed so many 
pro-democracy supporters during Aristide's exile. Can any new commander undo a 
tradition of brutal military rule that is almost as old as the Haitian republic 
itself? 
</P>
<P>
 Why does Haiti need an Army? There are no boundary disputes and no outside 
threats to national security. A strong military is the greatest source of 
instability in Haiti, and indeed throughout the Caribbean, Latin America and 
Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide got some good advice last week from the former president of Costa 
Rica, Oscar Arias Sanchez, who won a Nobel Peace Prize for his efforts to 
spread peace in Central America. Costa Rica disbanded its army in 1948, and 
peace has reigned since then. 
</P>
<P>
 Aristide must ask himself what will happen when the U.S. soldiers return home. 
That might happen sooner rather than later if the new Republican majorities in 
the House and Senate get their way after they take over Congress in January. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. troops are scheduled to leave in March and allow U.N. peacekeepers to 
finish the job. That deadline was chosen by the Clinton Administration to give 
Aristide ample time to hold elections, convene an independent Parliament and 
woo powerful and affluent Haitians to the side of democracy. Every bit of that 
time is needed. Certainly, no additional time will be granted by Republicans 
who initially opposed the U.S. rescue mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Military force is never pleasant or riskless, but U.S. troops have performed 
admirably and Haiti, at least so far, is much better off.

ITO INTERVIEW AND SIMPSON CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re "Ito's Televised Interview Lands Him in Controversy," Nov. 15: 
</P>
<P>
 Rewind that videotape! Wasn't that the same Judge Lance Ito appearing on local 
news the one presiding over the O.J. Simpson case? By rejecting jury candidates 
who slipped and listened to classical music on the radio or watched cartoons 
with their children, Judge Ito's iron edict cut out several informed citizens 
whose only sin was to inadvertently expose themselves to news blurbs. And now 
Judge Ito has the temerity to flood us for a week with news on him! 
</P>
<P>
 Judge, join the ranks of the attorneys in this case who have used the media 
for their own self-aggrandizement to the detriment of a fair trial. Don't 
forget, Dante reserved the eighth circle in Hell for hypocrites (wearing robes, 
no less)!

 * A UCLA professor of law says that Ito's appearance on TV "smacks of 
hypocrisy" because Ito has had some harsh words to say about media coverage. 
This is just another example of misunderstanding the judge's own rules for 
handling cases that command TV exposure. 
</P>
<P>
 The third of the maxims Ito wrote says: "The sirens of mythology pale in 
comparison to the allure of seeing yourself on CNN. The results, however, can 
be about the same." I believe this law professor has not realized the humor, 
the wisdom nor the profundity of this statement. He should read again Homer's 
"Odyssey" before he condemns Ito's decision to do these interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge is not discussing the Simpson case, but giving us all a look at his 
background so that we can better know and understand him and his reasoning. I 
find this to be most admirable and a fine example for all of our judges, most 
of whom are strangers to the public.

compelled to write you with hope that Fred Goldman and his family, as well as 
the Brown family, can know that there are many of us who share his anger over 
the outrageous media circus that has prevailed since the tragic murder of his 
son and Nicole Brown on June 12. 
</P>
<P>
 My husband and I feel the defense attorneys have made mockery of the justice 
system and continue to do so as they try to denigrate any person who can 
provide substantiation of Simpson's guilt. We support Goldman's frustration as 
the deaths of these two young people have seemingly become secondary to 
Simpson's plight as the prime suspect in the crime. With so much emphasis on 
the fear that Simpson will not get a fair trial, one is led to think that 
"fair" means he's found "not guilty" because of reasonable doubt. Well, we say 
that's not fair to the memory of the two victims and the two families who lost 
their loved ones. 
</P>
<P>
 We wish the Goldman and Brown families courage as the next few months unfold. 
May it help just a little to know that there are many of us who care about you 
and your loss. May justice win out.

 * It is ironic that, the day after the media "win" the "right" to cover the 
Simpson trial by television cameras, the networks and local stations proclaim 
they do not intend to offer gavel-to-gavel coverage (Nov. 8). Even the local 
stations are refusing to enter a consortium to offer gavel-to-gavel coverage on 
a rotating basis. 
</P>
<P>
 This is hilarious, and sad. The day after Kelli Sager (on behalf of, inter 
alia , The Times) piously argues that the public is learning civil procedure 
from gavel-to-gavel coverage, the day after Judge Ito expresses his concern 
about "sound bites" and distorted descriptions, the day after all the media 
attorneys argue the best protection against distorted coverage is 
gavel-to-gavel coverage -- the basic television outlets for that very 
information say they will not provide that very coverage! Most people cannot 
receive CNN, or Court TV -- where the gavel-to-gavel coverage will now be 
relegated. The public will now be offered "hourly updates." Of course, those 
updates will be delivered by anchor-people reading scripts written to attract 
attention, not to convey information. This coverage will be as biased, as 
contemptible, as the "teaser" ads local stations run for upcoming news shows. 
The media will apparently decide which days are "important days of the trial" 
in offering coverage. How does such selective coverage fit with allowing the 
public to be fully informed through all of the proceedings?

LIVABLE DOESN'T MEAN SLUMS; HOUSING: THERE ARE REMEDIES, BUT LOS ANGELES MUST 
HAVE THE WILL TO HELP THE DISENFRANCHISED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAUREN SAUNDERS, Lauren Saunders is the directing attorney of the Housing 
Conditions Action Team (HousCAT), a project of Bet Tzedek Legal Services. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lourdes has lived in her Los Angeles apartment in an aging building for 13 
years. The roof leaks so badly that the slightest drizzle forces her family to 
spend the night moving the beds to avoid the rain. Biting cockroaches infest 
her apartment, and one evening she caught 11 mice. Recently, a hot-water faucet 
stuck and she could not turn the water off. She immediately told the manager, 
but the water continued running for several weeks before the faucet was fixed. 
</P>
<P>
 The government has cited the building over and over for more than 15 years for 
health, building and safety violations. But a succession of landlords has 
continued to neglect the building. Although the city finally filed a criminal 
complaint against the current owner, the deputy city attorney handling the case 
confirmed that the court will most likely impose only a token fine and 
probation. Any repairs will undoubtedly be cosmetic, enough to fool the 
inspectors -- like they did a year ago -- but not to fix the real problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Lourdes and other tenants of the building, concerned about 
retaliation, met in a room at a nearby business to discuss their common 
problems. When the landlord found out, he angrily called the business and 
demanded that it cancel the meeting. He then stood on the street and noted 
which tenants attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, Lourdes does not have real options, other than moving -- if she 
could find one of Los Angeles' few affordable apartments without similar 
problems. Although state law allows her to use up to one month's rent to make 
repairs, her problems cost far more to fix than that. She could try withholding 
rent but would risk getting her family evicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Lourdes' situation is hardly unique. A year and a half has passed since a 
fatal fire in the Westlake area pointed out the shortcomings in the city's code 
enforcement efforts, and more than four years have gone by since The Times ran 
a series on slumlords' ability to beat the system. Yet little has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 The Building and Safety, Health and Fire departments are overworked and do not 
inspect or follow up on a vast number of violations. Moreover, they have almost 
no tools to enforce their orders. The city attorney's office can handle only 
the worst cases, which even then don't often result in significant penalties. 
The Housing Department has a program that gives tenants modest rent reductions 
and allows them to pay their rent to a city escrow account until repairs are 
made. Yet that program depends on an initial referral from a building, health 
or fire inspector, which often does not happen. Tenants also face retaliation 
if they pay their rent to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 This does not mean that there are no solutions. One proposal, which the City 
Council endorsed in concept last year, would allow tenants to get rent 
reductions without waiting indefinitely for a referral from another agency. But 
the proposal has languished. The Building and Safety, Health and Fire 
departments also could find better ways to enforce orders in cases that do not 
result in criminal prosecutions. Of the three agencies, only Building and 
Safety imposes noncompliance fees -- sporadically -- yet makes no effort to 
collect the fees unless the landlord needs to take out a permit. Automatic 
fines that mount if unpaid and become a lien on the building would put more 
teeth into the agencies' orders. A city that can collect parking-ticket fines 
can surely find ways of collecting fees for health and safety violations. A 
city audit done after the Westlake fires also proposed that all apartment 
buildings be inspected upon sale, rather than only upon complaint from 
intimidated tenants. The cost of such inspections could be covered as an escrow 
fee or by fees imposed on buildings found in violation. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no shortage of ideas for preventing our affordable housing stock from 
further deteriorating into slums or disappearing altogether. The question is 
one of political will. Low-income, disenfranchised parents and children with 
little political clout are the ones who live in substandard housing. The city 
must not continue to let its most vulnerable residents suffer blatant 
violations of health and safety laws by themselves, with little effective help 
from the government.

PERSPECTIVE ON ENTITLEMENTS; LIMITS NOW TO KEEP ECONOMY SOUND; WE CAN BEGIN BY 
MEANS-TESTING MEDICARE BENEFITS AND INSTITUTING MANDATORY SAVINGS ACCOUNTS FOR 
RETIREMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 The relentless growth of entitlement programs looms as a major obstacle to the 
long-term health of the U.S. economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 25 years, expenditures for Social Security, Medicaid and 
Medicare have expanded dramatically. Indeed, the government is now borrowing 
substantial funds simply to support increases in entitlement spending. As a 
result, the federal government no longer has the means to make significant 
investments in new initiatives to support economic growth, such as extensive 
job-training efforts or major new infrastructure projects. 
</P>
<P>
 Even worse, continuous increases in entitlement spending eventually may limit 
our ability to maintain adequate funding for programs like defense that are 
fundamental to basic government. 
</P>
<P>
 The impact that entitlement programs have had on federal spending is 
astounding. The portion of the federal budget devoted to basic government 
functions (justice, defense, agriculture, education, legislative, 
transportation, interior and Veterans Administration) decreased from 58% of 
federal spending in 1967 to 33% by 1992. These same programs are expected to 
make up less than 25% of the budget by 2004 when Social Security, Medicare and 
Medicaid will equal $1.2 trillion or nearly 50% of total federal spending. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, this spending is done with little regard to need or fairness. 
Less than 20% of entitlement spending finances means-tested programs (programs 
that help those who most need them). The average person retiring in 1990 will 
receive back more than 2 1/2 times what he or she contributed in Social 
Security payments plus interest. 
</P>
<P>
 But the unfairness of Social Security pales in comparison to the Medicare 
program. The average person retiring in 1990 will receive back in benefits more 
than five times his or her contributions to Medicare, with interest. And 
Medicare costs are projected to increase from $158 billion in 1994 to $434 
billion by 2004. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, our country's budget priorities are being set with reckless disregard 
for future generations. 
</P>
<P>
 However, if we act now, relatively simple steps can be taken to improve the 
fairness of current entitlement programs and to ensure that the federal 
government has the financial capability to perform its basic functions and to 
make investments in future economic growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Two fundamental reforms are needed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Means-test Medicare benefits. Make recipients, depending on their income, 
pay a portion or all of the costs of the Medicare insurance they receive. 
</P>
<P>
 * Institute mandatory individual savings accounts that are funded by a 5% 
payroll deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Under this plan, Medicare insurance would be paid using a means-tested formula 
whereby eligible families with incomes of $15,000 to 40,000 would pay a 
percentage of their premium costs, beginning with 10% at $15,000 and graduated 
in increments to 100% at $40,000. Families would pay a tax equal to the value 
of the Medicare insurance they received. Income from all sources would be 
included in this calculation. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important to recognize that, under the present Medicare system, the 
government provides medical insurance for recipients who have contributed very 
little money relative to the benefits they receive. Therefore, making Americans 
with retirement incomes greater than $40,000 pay their own way is much more 
fair. The current highly regressive Medicare system taxes poor workers to pay 
benefits to elderly Americans who are in many cases quite affluent. This change 
in the Medicare program would save about $75 billion a year by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Mandatory individual savings accounts would force all Americans to save 
significantly for their retirement. The 5% payroll tax paid by each worker 
would be invested in a private, qualified investment program chosen by the 
employee. When a citizen reaches retirement, funds in the account would be used 
to pay retirement income and 100% of Medicare premiums. When or if the account 
is depleted, Social Security payments would begin. By forcing savings now, we 
would immediately begin to accumulate funds to dampen the expected growth of 
Social Security expenditures as baby boomers retire. 
</P>
<P>
 The savings-account program combined with reforms in Medicare would over the 
next decade dramatically slow the growth of entitlement spending. A vested 
retirement program would have many other benefits. Entitlement spending 25 to 
30 years from now should actually begin to decline as a percentage of the 
federal budget, providing even more resources for investment in economic 
growth. The accounts would increase national savings, thereby decreasing the 
cost of equity and debt capital. By removing the specter of long-term deficits, 
driven by entitlement spending, the dollar would have an improved investment 
outlook. 
</P>
<P>
 But most important, individual savings accounts, combined with real reforms in 
the Medicare system, would give hope to young Americans that the system is 
sound. It would be made sound in the only credible way -- by making all of us 
more personally responsible for our retirement.

COLUMN LEFT/ TOM HAYDEN: THE SPECIAL INTERESTS STILL RULE; IN ALL THE TALK OF 
AN ELECTION REVOLUTION, THERE'S NO MENTION OF CAMPAIGN REFORM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM HAYDEN, State Sen. Tom Hayden is a Democrat representing parts of West 
Los Angeles and the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The central political abuse that will not be changed by the new Republican 
Establishment is the ongoing torrent of special-interest money for consultants, 
commercials and candidates that corrupts the democratic process. 
</P>
<P>
 Notably missing from Speaker-elect Newt Gingrich's Republican "contract" is 
any reform of campaign spending or the sordid skulduggery of the estimated 
80,000 lobbyists encamped in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Republican leadership is gearing to stand tall against welfare mothers 
but can't be found when it comes to confronting contributors seeking handouts. 
Gingrich declared to political-action-committee representatives in mid-October, 
"What we've said to all the PACs and, frankly, to their donors is that this is 
the year." He also warned that "for anybody who's not on board now, it's going 
to be the two coldest years in Washington." 
</P>
<P>
 But the problem now is bipartisan. In all the post-election chatter among 
Democrats, Republicans and Washington pundits, there has been little reference 
to reforming a system that obviously disgusts most voters. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly $100 million was spent in the California gubernatorial and U.S. Senate 
races alone, most of that on clashing commercials aimed at a small percentage 
of undecided voters. If democracy means a majority vote based on independent 
information, democracy is being killed by advertising. 
</P>
<P>
 Meaningful change is buried as well. Burning issues like the decline of our 
cities and schools and the inflationary growth of prisons go unaddressed while 
small but well-heeled farming and mining interests hammer politicians into 
protecting their century-old, virtually free access to public lands. 
</P>
<P>
 Even successful populist efforts of the past, such as Proposition 103, which 
required an elected insurance commissioner, have been turned upside down by 
stealth money. The insurance companies elected a pro-industry regulator, Chuck 
Quackenbush, and were the biggest contributors to Pete Wilson. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the key players in the power game benefit from the current 
fund-raising rules. The Republicans are not going to surrender the money 
arsenal that funded their sweep. The Democrats plan to be "comeback kids" in 
1996 with funds from interest groups of their own. The consult ant industry and 
the television networks make millions in fees. Only the public withdraws, 
retching. 
</P>
<P>
 If neither party proves capable of breaking its addiction to this treadmill, 
our situation requires an independent grass-roots movement, a legal challenge 
to the status quo, a statewide initiative in 1996 and perhaps even a third 
party before the decade is over. 
</P>
<P>
 To prevent another 1994 electoral debacle, here are the kinds of reform we 
need: 
</P>
<P>
 * An educational campaign to reverse the 1975 Supreme Court ruling that the 
unlimited spending of money in politics is a First Amendment right. It was 
supported by the ACLU, mistakenly believing that minority views could only be 
protected by sympathetic millionaires. 
</P>
<P>
 It is remarkable that so many politicians attack the courts for being soft on 
crime and abortion while none have challenged the courts' coddling of wealthy 
contributors and candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 * Applying anti-trust doctrine to electoral competition, there must be 
expenditure limits enacted, with public matching funds for candidates who agree 
to debates and other fair campaign practices. Contribution limits alone are not 
enough. Any interest group can arrange for thousands of small contributions in 
place of one big check. 
</P>
<P>
 * Regulate or eliminate 30- or 60-second commercials. Paid advertising is a 
marketing device, not democratic dialogue. It cannot be answered except by 
those with money. An alternative could be re-establishment of the "fairness 
doctrine." 
</P>
<P>
 * Liberate campaigns from Madison Avenue and center them in a multimedia "town 
square" through interactive video and the free media. 
</P>
<P>
 * There is no democratic reason to close voter registration 30 days before an 
election. Nor should elections be limited to 12 hours on a working day when 
they could be administered on a weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Gingrichites, like the incumbents before them, can celebrate the 
winning of office but it is unlikely that they can govern fairly or 
efficiently. Their own arrogance leads to policies that are too self-serving to 
solve the problems of society. The crisis, then, will deepen until their 
addictive paradigm is shattered.

PHARM REPORT: BODY WATCH; THE NEWEST DRUGS ARE NOT ALWAYS THE BEST ONES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHLEEN DOHENY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a prescription drug is approved by the Food and Drug Administration, 
manufacturers tout it as the newest and the best medicine. Often, they claim 
the new treatment has fewer side effects and works better than established 
medicines. In a random poll, pharmacists tell which drugs are increasingly 
recommended by physicians -- and what they consider to be the pros and cons of 
each. 
</P>
<P>
 Lescol (fluvastatin): This is a treatment for high cholesterol in patients who 
don't respond to diet changes alone. Approved by the FDA in late 1993, Lescol 
works by blocking the synthesis of low-density lipoprotein, the so-called bad 
cholesterol, in the liver, decreasing the concentration of LDLs and total blood 
cholesterol. 
</P>
<P>
 It is prescribed for once-a-day treatment, usually in the evening with a meal 
or at bedtime, according to a representative for Sandoz Pharmaceuticals Corp., 
the manufacturer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lescol tends to be less expensive than other cholesterol-lowering drugs," 
says Philip Towne, a pharmacist and supervisor of the Drug Information Service 
at Long Beach Memorial Medical Center. "But the maximal cholesterol lowering 
(effect) tends to be a bit lower." So while it's appropriate for those with 
mild to moderate cholesterol problems, it's probably not indicated for those 
with severe cholesterol problems, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Diflucan (fluconazole): Launched in July by Pfizer, Diflucan is promoted as 
the first oral, one-dose prescription medicine for vaginal yeast infections. 
(It's also used for other fungal infections.) 
</P>
<P>
 When prescribed for vaginal infections, this anti-fungal medicine eliminates 
the need to use traditional medications inserted vaginally for several days, 
which women often find messy and inconvenient, says Carl Kildoo, a pharmacist 
at Long Beach Memorial. 
</P>
<P>
 Effexor (venlafaxine): An antidepressant, Effexor works on two 
neurotransmitters rather than one to improve mood, says a representative for 
Wyeth-Ayerst Laboratories, the manufacturer, which began marketing the drug in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Effexor is offered in five strengths, it is easier for a physician to 
prescribe a more exact dose based on an individual's needs, says Lee Souder, 
pharmacist-owner of Cal-Med Pharmacy West in La Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The drug might also be a good first-line medicine, Souder says, especially for 
treating a first bout of depression. 
</P>
<P>
 But Towne sees it differently. Until there is more long-term experience with 
Effexor, Towne recommends it as a treatment for those who have not been treated 
successfully with other antidepressants. Patients should be aware it can 
increase blood pressure, he adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs of Effexor and competitors, such as Zoloft (sertraline), are comparable 
if Effexor is dosed two times a day and Zoloft once, Towne says. But if Effexor 
is prescribed at a three-times-a-day dose, it can get more expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Famvir (famciclovir): Prescribed as a treatment for shingles, a painful viral 
disease caused by varicella zoster virus, Famvir received FDA approval for 
marketing in late June. It's the first new oral drug in the anti-herpes virus 
category in several years, says a representative for the manufacturer, 
SmithKline Beecham. 
</P>
<P>
 Famvir interferes with replication of the virus by blocking its DNA synthesis. 
</P>
<P>
 It's prescribed three times a day, while another shingles drug, Zovirax 
(acyclovir), is often prescribed five times daily, Towne says. It's comparable 
in cost to Zovirax, Towne says, depending on how long a treatment is 
prescribed. Famvir is usually prescribed three times a day for seven days; 
Zovirax is recommended five times a day for seven to 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Caveats: Even though a new treatment might sound like an improvement over 
existing medicine, some physicians and pharmacists are reluctant to recommend 
it, they say, due to increased cost over drugs that have been on the market for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 In other cases, physicians and pharmacists are waiting for longer-term use, to 
be sure unforeseen side effects don't crop up.

DOWNTIME: BODY WATCH; COMMUNING WITH A ROOSTER IN THE EARLY HOURS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 No matter what time I go to bed, I still am a very early riser.I have learned 
to deal with it by walking across the street to my neighbor's yard to visit her 
rooster. He has black-and-gray feathers and is quite magnificent in height. As 
he begins to crow, I advance toward him, offering his first meal of the day. I 
enjoy this early time as I have befriended the rooster; believe it or not, I 
now do a pretty good cock-a-doodle-doo myself.

BOOK REVIEW / HISTORY; PAYING TRIBUTE TO THE SIMPLE DECADE THAT TIME FORGOT; AS 
SEEN ON TV BY KARAL ANN MARLING . HARVARD UNIVERSITY PRESS: $24.95, 322 PAGES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One of the cardinal rules of lit crit is, never review a book written by 
someone you know. It's a clear conflict of interest. What they didn't teach us 
was how to handle a subject with which you're on intimate terms. So I feel the 
need to make a disclaimer: I was a little kid in the 1950s. I owned a sack 
dress and a chemise (and I remember the difference), I ate Swanson TV dinners, 
and the landlady downstairs threatened to throw us out because my sister and I 
made a daily, rather noisy stampede to the TV set to watch the Mouseketeers. 
</P>
<P>
 I find "As Seen on TV" irresistible because it makes sense of the nonsense of 
my youth; that's part of its attraction, but not all of it. Karal Ann Marling's 
enthusiasm is refreshing, entertaining and imaginative. Her energy is 
infectious; the effusiveness gets the better of her from time to time, but hey. 
This is the '50s. Life is supposed to be simple and simply grand. 
</P>
<P>
 A professor of art history and American studies, Marling considers the '50s a 
visual culture -- everything was a work of art, from Mamie Eisenhower's custom 
shirtwaists, designed by Molly Parnis, to the color of the fried chicken on a 
Swanson box. The end of World War II collided with new visual technologies, and 
the result was a decade devoted to excess and innovation (not all of it 
necessary, but much of it fun). 
</P>
<P>
 The book is divided into a handful of sections, each of which addresses major 
cultural issues of the day, all of them chockablock with the sort of anecdotal 
detail that makes it hard to put the book down. My only memory of Mamie 
Eisenhower was of a grandmotherly First Lady. Who knew that she was a 
clotheshorse? That she, like so many women in this country, was chafing at the 
bit, ready to give up drab clothing and embrace self-indulgence. 
</P>
<P>
 If a wide skirt with yards of cloth in it confirmed that rationing was over, 
then Eisenhower's skirt would be one of the widest. If a pink formal gown was 
good, then a pink formal gown festooned with 2,000 hand-sewn pink rhinestones 
was better. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems we might even have seen Eisenhower in one of those controversial sack 
dresses had her husband not convinced her to cancel the order. 
</P>
<P>
 Marling tells us as well about the Disney empire and the importance of big, 
snazzy cars, about paint-by-number culture, Elvis, and Nixon in Moscow. But it 
was the chapter on food that got to me. I've often wondered whether I ingested 
any vitamins at all when I was a kid, given the amount of processing that had 
gotten between me and anything I ate. If all the preservatives keep working, I 
ought to live to 100 easily. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Marling makes sense out of what now seems an unhealthy obsession with ease 
and uniformity -- and anyone who considers himself even a semipro foodie should 
find her research vastly interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 I now know why the first TV dinner featured turkey, why Betty Crocker turned 
out to be a liability once companies started to advertise on television, why we 
were served -- and happily devoured -- chicken croquettes shaped to look like 
baby chicks (it was a staple on the tea menu at Chicago's Marshall Field & Co. 
department store when I was little, but I had no idea it was part of an 
aesthetic movement). 
</P>
<P>
 If some of this stuff sounds a little wacko, it is, which is part of its 
charm. Marling's not writing about the rebellious 1960s, the counterculture of 
the 1970s, or even the rapacious greed of the 1980s. She's chosen a decade that 
has a rather cartoonish reputation, although I'd argue it's not the only one we 
can make jokes about; surely that chicken croquette is no more a travesty than 
the turkeys that vegetarians used to sculpt out of politically correct mashed 
comestibles. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, she manages to make the decade that time forgot come alive. Her prose 
style can best be described as hell-bent, as she tears from one factoid to 
another, and what she knows successfully distracts the reader from what she 
doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a media history, not a social history; we find out about families as 
consumers of Disney-mania, but not as social units. A quibble. Marling knows a 
lot about how we looked and what it meant. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd like to see her tackle the '60s next.

 Updating His Droids: Director and special effects master George Lucas will use 
the latest in computer graphics to update "Star Wars" for a 20th-anniversary 
release in 1997. Lucas also will add previously unreleased footage and a 
digitally remastered soundtrack, according to Lucasfilm Ltd. and 20th Century 
Fox, which will distribute the new version for theatrical release. Using 
technology that his Industrial Light & Magic company developed to create 
effects for "Jurassic Park" and "Forrest Gump," Lucas is planning to add 
creatures within the city of Mos Eisley and in the Tatooine Dunes, as well as 
new vehicles and Droids. He also will complete a scene, filmed in 1976 but not 
used, in which Han Solo confronts Jabba the Hutt. The changes will "bring the 
movie closer to my original vision," Lucas said. "Star Wars" is the 
third-leading box-office attraction of all time, having taken in $322 million 
in the United States and Canada alone. TELEVISION

 Independent Thinkers: Bravo Cable Network will feature offerings from the new 
Independent Film Channel on Saturday and Sunday beginning at 5 each evening. 
The independent channel, managed by Bravo, was launched Sept. 1 and specializes 
in films made outside the Hollywood studio system -- commercial-free and 
unedited. Among the weekend highlights will be Akira Kurosawa's "Dreams" and 
Francois Truffaut's "Confidentially Yours." POP/ROCK

 Learning the Hard Way: Country singer Merle Haggard went to San Quentin prison 
to record a two-part TV special that's being shown on the Nashville Network 
tonight and Wednesday at 5 (repeated at 9 p.m.). The setting had special 
meaning for Haggard, who served time there from 1957 to 1960 for burglary. "It 
was here that something happened in my life and I was able to see maybe further 
than I'd ever been able to see, even though I was behind the walls, and I 
realized that this was not my calling," Haggard said. "As much as I thought I 
wanted to be Bonnie Parker or Clyde Barrow or one of those people, well, I was 
wrong, and I realized it here."

 Performing the Hard Way: Rapper Ice Cube was performing his "Natural Born 
Killaz" Friday in Hickory, N.C., when a beer bottle sailed out of the audience 
and bloodied his face. The singer "just put a towel up to his head and finished 
the song," said Nate Quick, a disc jockey who was emceeing the show. The rapper 
then went to a hospital and got four stitches.

 Traveling the Hard Way: Former teen-age heartthrob Davy Jones, the 49-year-old 
front man for the Monkees, took a 3-year-old filly named Love Dancing for a 
tune-up run on the track at Churchill Downs. "It's a thrill," the 5-foot-4, 
128-pound Jones said. "It's always been in my blood to do this kind of thing." 
Jones, in Louisville, Ky., appearing in "Grease," held an amateur steeplechase 
jockey's license in his native England and says he'd like to train race horses 
someday. STAGE

 'Miss Saigon' Catching On: Advance sales for "Miss Saigon," which opens Jan. 
25 at the Ahmanson Theatre, passed the $8-million mark at the end of last week. 
But tickets for every performance through June 4, other than opening night, are 
still available, said a spokeswoman for the show.

 Alas, Poor Lloyd Webber: Eighty-seven British playwrights, including leading 
dramatists Harold Pinter, Peter Shaffer and Stephen Berkoff, are asking theater 
directors to increase the number of new plays produced. "If theater is to have 
a future there must be a return to new work, and this means a change in the way 
present budgets are spent," the playwrights said in a letter to theater 
directors that was also published in Monday's Guardian newspaper. Critics and 
theatergoers have also expressed concern that mainstream theaters stick too 
closely to a diet of Shakespeare, 19th-Century favorites and musicals by Andrew 
Lloyd Webber. The playwrights asked theaters to each produce at least three new 
plays a year. "It is very little to ask and represents the first step back from 
the brink of the absurd situation that we are very close to -- theaters with no 
plays," the writers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Albee Wins in England: American playwright Edward Albee was getting along just 
fine in London, where his play "Three Tall Women" and its English star, Dame 
Maggie Smith, were named best play and best actress at the 40th Evening 
Standard Drama Awards. The presentation Monday came less than a week after the 
British opening of the acclaimed American work, a still-running Off Broadway 
hit that won the Pulitzer Prize for drama this year. In accepting his award, 
Albee said he is "astonished" whenever he wins a prize -- "and equally 
astonished whenever I do not." PEOPLE WATCH

 Holiday Guests: With a special nod to struggling actors and comics, the Laugh 
Factory will host its 16th annual free Thanksgiving Day and Christmas dinners

WEEKEND BOX OFFICE; APPEALING TO ALL 'GENERATIONS'

 With generations of Trekkers providing a built-in audience, Paramount 
Pictures' "Star Trek: Generations" soared to the top of the weekend box-office 
chart. As science-fiction fans of the intergalactic saga fretted over the 
future of Capt. James Kirk, the movie did what Paramount had hoped all along: 
attract moviegoers to a later generation of "Star Trek" heroes, one that may no 
longer feature Kirk, Spock and the crew of the original Enterprise. 
</P>

 Battling it out for second place were two distinctly different movies that 
debuted the prior week. When the final figures were in, Warner Bros.' 
"Interview With the Vampire" barely edged out Disney's holiday comedy "The 
Santa Clause." Meanwhile, Fox's competing Santa movie, the John Hughes' remake 
of "Miracle on 34th Street," had a dreadful debut with less than $3 million.

TRIO OF VIDEOS GIVES YOUNG HIGH-FLIERS A LIFT

 Some young enthusiasts light up at the sight of a train, others are crazy 
about fire engines, cars or heavy construction equipment. And then, there are 
those who always seem to have their heads in the clouds. For those high fliers, 
three recent edutainment videos may do the trick: 
</P>
<P>
 In "The Big Plane Trip," with charming child narration, viewers are invited to 
take an overnight flight on an enormous international airliner from Atlanta to 
Switzerland. The well-filmed video progresses from the process of checking in 
at the airport, to general plane operation basics, flight attendant training, 
food preparation, cargo loading, a pilot's-eye view of the flight and a bit of 
Swiss sightseeing. The live action is interspersed with simple, animated 
graphics and illustrations.

 The truly serious fan might prefer the less people-oriented, more machine 
facts-and-figures approach of "Ready for Take-Off." This hourlong, leisurely 
look at the inner and outer workings of mostly small planes, from little Piper 
Cubs to chunky biplanes and graceful, gull-like gliders, is hosted by flight 
instructor Orton, a big, genial fellow with a pleasantly unpatronizing manner. 
He explains plane parts, instrument panels, navigation and aerodynamics as the 
planes take off and land on a grassy strip surrounded by autumnal New England 
woods. Later, there's a visit to Washington National Airport for a look at some 
jets and a few words with air controller Diane and pilot Captain Keith.

 For those who prefer to keep their feet on solid ground, "Building 
Skyscrapers" is the ticket. Construction Manager David and a boy named Jeffrey 
observe the building of a New York skyscraper and take a tour of the city's 
most towering edifices, including a trip to the top of the Empire State 
Building. Sights include huge jackhammers, cranes, earthmovers and excavators, 
the remarkable demolition by explosives of old buildings and recalcitrant 
rocks, and the upward progression of enormous beams, the framework upon which 
workers balance like beefy tightrope walkers. 
</P>
<P>
 With his relaxed manner and mild Brooklynese, construction manager David 
Rothstein is an appealing tour guide and friendly expert; directors David 
Alpert and Audrey Irwin further humanize the proceedings by focusing on the 
workers -- men and women -- as well as on machinery and buildings.

 "They wear suit jackets when they should be wearing straitjackets.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; USC; MISSED BLOCKS PUT WALTERS IN DOGHOUSE

<TEXT>
<P>
 USC tailback Shawn Walters is in the doghouse, but might be released after 
only a day or two. 
</P>
<P>
 Walters missed two blocks that resulted in two of UCLA's six sacks of Rob 
Johnson in the loss on Saturday.Walters, who has a cracked thumb, started 
against UCLA but had only three carries. 
</P>
<P>
 Backup Leonard Green gained 86 yards in 18 carries and scored a touchdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach John Robinson said Walters would be the starter against Notre Dame. The 
225-pound sophomore is averaging five yards per carry and has gained 852 yards 
this season. 
</P>

<P>
 Saturday's 5 p.m. Coliseum game against the Irish is sold out. . . . USC wide 
receiver Keyshawn Johnson went over 1,000 yards for the season against UCLA, 
with 11 receptions for 175 yards. He is only the third Trojan to go over 1,000 
in receiving yardage, joining Johnnie Morton, 1,520 in in 1993, and Gary 
Wellman, 1,015, in 1990. . . . Notre Dame's sophomore quarterback, Ron Powlus, 
needs one touchdown pass against USC to become Notre Dame's all-time 
single-season record holder with 19. . . . Both USC and its opponents are 
converting 35.4% of their third downs. . . . USC defensive coordinator Don 
Lindsey and safeties coach Keith Burns are former assistants under Notre Dame 
Coach Lou Holtz, when he was at Arkansas. . . . Notre Dame leads in the USC 
series, 38-23-4, and has won the last 11, longest streak in the series, which 
began in 1926. Before that, USC had won five in a row, 1978-82. John Robinson's 
five-game winning streak over Notre Dame ended at South Bend last season, in a 
31-13 Irish victory. EARL GUSTKEY

ALLAN MALAMUD: NOTES ON A SCORECARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALLAN MALAMUD

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ever optimistic, the Angels are proceeding as though there will be an American 
League season in 1995. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to be better next year," said club President Richard Brown. 
"We'll fill some weaknesses at the market place, our youngsters will be more 
experienced, and our manager, Marcel Lachemann, will be here from the start of 
spring training." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The reports from Venezuela on first baseman J.T. Snow are terrific, but have 
you ever heard about anyone having a lousy winter league season? . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Our three biggest needs are a closer, a quality right-handed starter, and 
another power hitter," Brown said. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Thus far, the only player the Angels admit they are trying to sign is closer 
Lee Smith. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 They also are seeking a new, baseball-only stadium in Anaheim. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "We're not sitting back and telling the city to build us a stadium," Brown 
said. "This would be a joint venture, a kind of quasi-partnership." . . . 
</P>
<P>
 The city is expected to decide on the project -- which would include retail 
shops, motels and other businesses -- within three weeks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Brown is hoping that baseball will have a new labor agreement by then. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "The Angels will lose $8.5 million this year," he said. "It would have been 
about $2 million if the entire season had been played." . . .  
</P>
<P>
 I'll take his word without asking to see the books. . . .  
</P>

 Taft High in Woodland Hills has alumni who coach in the NFL -- the Houston 
Oilers' Jeff Fisher of the class of '72 -- and manage in the major leagues -- 
the Boston Red Sox's Kevin Kennedy of the class of '76. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Another Taft class of '76 member, XTRA talk-show host Steve Hartman, believes 
no other high school in the nation can match that. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 If the NFL playoffs were going to start this week, which they aren't, the 
Cleveland Browns, Kansas City Chiefs and New York Jets would be the AFC 
wild-card teams. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders, Jets and Buffalo Bills are tied at 6-5, but the Jets have the 
best intra-conference record and have beaten the Bills twice. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Three of the Raiders' five remaining games are at home and three are against 
teams that now have winning records. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Three of the Jets' last five are at home and two are against teams with 
winning records. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the Bills' last five are at home and two are against teams with winning 
records. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Former Ram linebacker Don Paul recently shook hands with an old rival, NFL 
Hall of Fame running back Hugh McElhenny, at a luncheon. "That's the first time 
I ever touched him," Paul said. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Wayne Cook became the first UCLA starting quarterback since the Bruins 
switched from the single-wing in 1962 to beat USC in consecutive games. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Fashion note: Corey Nakatani wore a ski mask to protect his face from the cold 
at Hollywood Park Friday night and rode three winners. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Irvine Valley College basketball Coach Bill Mulligan says 7-0 center Keon 
Clark of Danville, Ill., is the best prospect he's had in a college career 
spanning more than 30 years. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Getting Chris Webber from the Golden State Warriors for Tom Gugliotta and 
first-round draft choices in 1996, 1998 and 2000 was a steal for the Washington 
Bullets. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 That is if Webber, who is eligible to become a restricted free agent after 
this season, stays with the Bullets and they finish high enough to lower the 
quality of those picks. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Congratulations to talented producer-director Susan Stratton, who has been 
promoted to executive producer for sports programming at Channel 9. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Oscar De La Hoya looked terrific on the Roy Jones-James Toney card when, 
making every punch count, he stopped Carl Griffith in the third round. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The Golden Boy from East L.A. hasn't faced strong opponents yet, but gives 
every indication he will be able to handle a rise in competition. . . . He has 
stopped the pre-fight smiling and waving to the crowd and is all business from 
the moment he leaves his dressing room. . . . Friday was the 50th anniversary 
of the day that newspapers reported that Louie Zamperini, who had won two NCAA 
mile titles at USC, was shot down and killed in World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamperini is still alive and well and working on youth projects in Hollywood. 
He was rescued in the Pacific Ocean after spending weeks in a life raft.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; HENLEY MAY MISS REST OF SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE REILLEY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cornerback Darryl Henley was released from a San Francisco hospital Monday, 
but the prognosis on his torn hip flexor muscle from Sunday's 49ers' game 
remained the same: He will be sidelined four weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Chuck Knox said doctors believed Henley might have re-aggravated a hip 
injury he suffered a few years ago.Knox tried to remain optimistic that the 
cornerback would return before the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a week-to-week thing, but the doctors are still talking four weeks," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 With only five games to play, the Rams might lose Henley for the rest of the 
season. He faces a January trial for federal drug trafficking charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley hurt his hip covering on John Taylor's 14-yard reception late in the 
second quarter, cutting short what Knox called "a fantastic year." Henley 
started the last nine games, intercepting two passes and registering 46 
tackles, sixth on the team. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Bailey or Steve Israel is expected to replace him. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Running back Johnny Bailey and Leo Goeas, who both missed Sunday's game with 
abdominal strains, are expected to return this week, Knox said. MIKE REILLEY

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE NFL; GARRETT TO REPLACE AIKMAN THURSDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jason Garrett will start at quarterback for the Dallas Cowboys against the 
Green Bay Packers on Thursday while Troy Aikman and Rodney Peete recover from 
injuries doctors have decided weren't as serious as first feared. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys brought in veteran quarterbacks Mike Pagel and Tommy Hodson on 
Monday, and will decide today which of the two to sign. 
</P>
<P>
 Aikman, who suffered a left knee ligament sprain in Sunday's 31-7 victory over 
Washington, was limping on his 28th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be two weeks or it could be five weeks from now," Aikman said. "I'd 
be shocked if I felt good enough to play on Thursday. I don't see that as a 
possibility, but I'm not going to rule it out." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Barry Switzer, "I believe in fairy tales. I believe in Disneyland 
and Tinker Bell and Captain Hook. I like situations like this. We could have us 
a new hero." 
</P>
<P>
 Peete's ligament damage in his right thumb wasn't as severe as first feared. 
He might be back Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Green Bay's Reggie White, the league's career sack leader, will be sidelined 
for an NFL game for the first time on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The defensive end had a magnetic resonance imaging test to determine whether 
he sustained ligament damage to his left elbow when he was injured during 
Sunday's 29-20 loss at Buffalo. 
</P>
<P>
 The Packers said they wouldn't release results of the examination until today. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Milwaukee Sentinel reported that White's agent, Jimmy Sexton, said 
White told him he'd be out two to four weeks. Sexton said White indicated there 
were torn ligaments but he won't need surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Packer safety Tim Hauck will be sidelined three to four weeks because of 
a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After contemplating retirement, Cincinnati Bengal running back Steve Broussard 
plans to return to practice as soon as doctors confirm that there are no 
lingering problems from a collision that left him paralyzed briefly. . . . 
Pittsburgh Steelers guard Todd Kalis will be sidelined the rest of the season 
because of a broken right ankle and defensive end Gerald Williams will be 
sidelined at least a month because of a torn tendon in his right arm. Coach 
Bill Cowher will decide later this week whether Mike Tomczak or Neil O'Donnell 
will start at quarterback Sunday against the Raiders. . . . Tampa Bay leading 
receiver Jackie Harris, who has 26 receptions for 337 yards and three 
touchdowns, will have surgery on his left shoulder and be sidelined the 
remainder of the season. . . . Miami linebacker Chris Singleton was diagnosed 
with a fractured leg and could miss the rest of the season.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; LEWIS EXPECTED BACK ON SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE SPRINGER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cornerback Albert Lewis, who has been sidelined the last two games because of 
a sprained right knee, expects to be back on the practice field this week and 
back in action Sunday at the Coliseum against the Steelers. 
</P>
<P>
 Not so certain to return is fellow cornerback Lionel Washington, who missed 
last Sunday's game against the New Orleans Saints because of a bruised calf 
muscle.More should be known about Washington's condition later in the week. 
</P>
<P>
 If neither Lewis nor Washington are able to play Sunday, the Raiders will 
again use James Trapp at right cornerback. 
</P>
<P>
 Center Don Mosebar is limping on a twisted ankle, suffered on Sunday. But when 
Coach Art Shell tried to send in Dan Turk to relieve Mosebar, the Raider center 
waved Turk off. How much mobility Mosebar will have against the Steelers 
remains to be seen. 
</P>
<P>
 Also hurting is quarterback Jeff Hostetler, but that's a weekly story. 
Hostetler went into Sunday's game with three jammed toes and added a twisted 
neck to his long list of ailments. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler ignored his medical problems and completed 22 of 28 passes for 310 
yards and three touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Asked afterward how his three injured toes felt, Hostetler replied, "Snap and 
crackle were pretty good, but pop was pretty sore today." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 With their ticket office closed Thursday afternoon because of the Thanksgiving 
holiday, the Raiders will ask the league to extend the blackout deadline 24 
hours, giving them until Friday at 1 p.m. to sell out the Coliseum for Sunday's 
Raider-Steeler game and televise it locally. The ticket office will be open 
Thursday from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. STEVE SPRINGER

ELEMENTS CHANGE, BUT BOTTOM LINE IS THE SAME -- ANOTHER LOSS FOR OILERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Only the faces are different for the Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 And the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 But not the result. 
</P>
<P>
 David Treadwell kicked a 37-yard field goal with two seconds to play Monday 
night to help the New York Giants snap a seven-game losing streak with a 13-10 
victory over Houston, which lost for the seventh consecutive time. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the third time in a row and sixth time this season that the Oilers have 
lost by three points. The previous times, Jack Pardee was their coach. This 
time, Jeff Fisher found out what it was like. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustration for the entire coaching staff to lose a game like this after 
the way we played today," Fisher said. "We played good enough to win, but we 
made a few mistakes and beat ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher, who replaced Jack Pardee last Monday, ditched Houston's run-and-shoot 
offense. The result was a plodding running attack and a less-than-explosive 
game between two teams having all sorts of problems. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not the way I wanted to start off," Fisher said. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the way the Giants wanted to finish. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's nice to see them get some reward for all the hard work they've put in," 
Coach Dan Reeves said. The Giants ended their longest losing streak since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent Graham, who replaced Dave Brown at quarterback in the second quarter 
after the Giants' starter sustained a concussion, rallied the Giants after a 
scoreless first half and gave New York a 5-0 all-time record against the 
Oilers. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham threw a 40-yard touchdown pass to Mike Sherrard and set up Treadwell's 
first field goal, a 26-yarder, with a 55-yard pass to Sherrard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were just throwing the ball up high, giving him a chance to come down with 
it," Graham said. "It was frustrating early on. I just want to keep getting 
better every week." 
</P>
<P>
 New York led, 10-7, with 8:19 to play, but the Oilers tied it with 4:08 left 
on Al Del Greco's 42-yard field goal. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher turned the play-calling over to offensive coordinator Dick Coury, but 
the Oilers didn't get into the end zone until 4:44 remained in the third 
quarter on Billy Joe Tolliver's one-yard keeper. 
</P>
<P>
 The score came one play after Tolliver completed a 41-yard screen pass to 
Lorenzo White, who was knocked out of bounds at the one by Jesse Campbell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Giants responded on their next series, capped by Graham's 40-yard 
touchdown pass to Sherrard. 
</P>
<P>
 The Oilers, who ranked among the top offensive teams in the NFL in recent 
years with the run-and-shoot, didn't use it in the first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they gave the ball to White, who had eight carries for 40 yards in 
the first quarter and 116 yards by halftime. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished with a career-high 156 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisher showed he wasn't afraid to take chances on offense, going for a first 
down on fourth-and-one at the Giants' 40 in the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The try failed, and the Giants ran out the clock to end the half.

COMMUNITY COLLEGE NOTEBOOK / STEVE KRESAL: SWEARINGEN'S RETIREMENT FROM 
SADDLEBACK IS STRAIGHT, SIMPLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Ken Swearingen's no-frills football coaching style remained constant right up 
to Saturday, when he announced his retirement from Saddleback College. 
</P>
<P>
 Swearingen, the winningest football coach in the history of community 
colleges, didn't make a big deal out of stepping down. Instead, he kept his 
farewell simple and straight-forward, just the way he ran his program. 
</P>
<P>
 Swearingen, who will retire from teaching in May, didn't use his leaving as a 
way to rally his players before his final game, a 52-21 loss to Rancho Santiago 
at Santa Ana Stadium. Instead, he gathered the team in the locker room 
afterward and made the announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Swearingen leaves with a record of 247-80-8 in 33 seasons. His 1985 and 1992 
Saddleback teams won national championships and his 1971 El Camino team won a 
State title. 
</P>
<P>
 Swearingen had a mark of 98-31-5 in 14 seasons at El Camino and was 149-49-3 
in 19 seasons at Saddleback. His teams won 14 conference titles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He should be remembered for all the joy he brought to Saddleback athletics," 
said Keith Calkins, dean of physical education and athletics. "His teams always 
seemed to get the athletic year off to a good start and gave the other (teams) 
something to build on." 
</P>
<P>
 Swearingen was a standout running back in the 1950s at El Camino and at the 
University of the Pacific. He earned his bachelor's and master's degrees. He 
also earned a Ph.D. in education at USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Swearingen is the second Orange County football coach to retire this season. 
Golden West's Ray Shackleford was forced to resign after 29 seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Rancho Santiago's Dave Ogas (13 seasons) is now the dean of Orange County 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a lot of respect for both of them," Ogas said. "All the coaches have 
always had a lot of camaraderie with each other. I guess I learned that first 
from Coach (Hal) Sherbeck." 
</P>
<P>

UC IRVINE NOTEBOOK / JOHN WEYLER; AFTER 15 YEARS, TENNIS COACH DECIDES HE 
WOULDN'T MIND A FLASHBACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Myron McNamara knew he wanted to be back at UC Irvine the minute he saw Brad 
Gilbert's boxer shorts. And the realization came moments before his first match 
as the tennis coach at Arizona State. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, the Sun Devils' star player, exited the dressing room and headed 
toward the court with about three inches of underwear extending below his 
tennis shorts. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were picked like fifth or sixth in the preseason polls and Brad was my No. 
1 player," McNamara said, "but the kid isn't going to school and I hate that. 
Then, he shows up for our first tournament with those polka-dot boxers hanging 
down to here. 
</P>
<P>
 "So I said, 'What the heck are you doing?' And he says, 'I always play like 
this.' I said, 'Look, this is a first-class club, we're guests here and we're 
going to be first-class too.' So he slams the door on me, but he changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, on the third point, the kid he's playing hits a really nice cross-court 
winner. I'm sitting right there, the ball's six inches in from the corner and 
there's only one mark on the court, six inches in. Brad calls it out. So I walk 
up to the court and say, 'What's going on?' He says, 'It was out.' I said, 
'There's only one mark, do you see something I don't see?' He says, 'It was 
out.' Then he starts to give me some lip, so I bounced him off the team right 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Three weeks later, football Coach Frank Kush was seen on television trying to 
rip the head off of one of his players and soon Athletic Director Fred Miller, 
the man who had talked McNamara into leaving Irvine, was fired. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a stupid move on my part," says McNamara, who is back with the 
Anteater men's team as an assistant coach. "I've always loved it here and I 
never should have left, but like every other idiot, I wanted to be in the 
Pac-10." 
</P>
<P>
 He stayed at Arizona State three years before returning to the Southland in 
1981 to teach and consult at the Riviera and John Wayne tennis clubs, 
facilities he helped establish. 
</P>
<P>
 When Irvine Coach Steve Clark approached McNamara with the idea of returning 
to Irvine 15 years after leaving, McNamara admitted he "thought long and hard." 
</P>
<P>
 "I like the guy a lot," McNamara said. "He's a very nice person and he's got a 
blow torch. And I guess when it's in your blood, it's in your blood. I've 
always liked coaching, the relationships with the kids, and if I'm any good, I 
should be able to help this bunch. So I figured, if they'll put up with me, 
then I'm the luckiest old dude in the world." 
</P>
<P>
 Clark and McNamara are a bit of an odd couple. Clark doesn't hand out much 
praise in practice, so McNamara will yell, "How about that backhand, Coach? 
Doesn't that deserve a smile?" while Clark is working with a player. 
</P>
<P>
 "Philosophically, we're right on target, the same values, the same 
expectations," Clark said. "I'm a little more intense and he's a bit of a 
cornball, so that keeps things loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Although McNamara teaches many young players privately -- UCLA's Keri Phebus, 
a former Corona del Mar standout, to name one -- he still wondered how he would 
be accepted on collegiate courts after being away a decade and a half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, I was scared to death they'd say, 'Look at that old fogy, where did 
that clown come from and where's his wheelchair?' " McNamara said. "But it 
doesn't seem to be that way. They seem to take you for what you have to offer." 
</P>
<P>
 McNamara, who answers questions about his age with "Jeepers, creepers, let's 
don't talk about that ," has offered and given much over the years. And he 
isn't ready to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's nothing I haven't been through with kids," he said. "I've had some 
tragic things happen, but the good things that come out make up for that. Forty 
years later, they still call and say, 'Coach, how are you doing? Glad you're 
still vertical.' 
</P>
<P>
 "In some cases, I've taught mom and dad, and then their kids, and now I'm 
teaching the grandchildren. That's how stupid this whole thing is. But really, 
how lucky can you be? And as long as your enthusiasm is up . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Breakfast with Duke: One morning about 7 a.m., the gate to Court 6 at UCI 
Tennis Stadium opened and John Wayne walked in. 
</P>
<P>
 "He used to support our program," McNamara said. "It was in the last weeks of 
his life and he just showed up. He said he hadn't been feeling well and he woke 
up early and decided to come by. I asked him if he had eaten anything yet and 
we sat and talked and had doughnuts and orange juice. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was the last time I saw him." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If you build it . . .: Basketball Coach Rod Baker hopes this season's 
recruiting class, which includes three potential starters, will be the first 
step in building the program into a winner. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, he hopes, the Bren Center won't be only half full when the Anteaters 
play and he'll have a home-court advantage to rival some of the Big West's best 
teams. 
</P>
<P>
 But, first things first. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our part of it is winning games," he said. "I don't necessarily know if 
that's the entire answer, but first we've got to win some games and then we'll 
find out if the people will come." Anteater Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The women's basketball team, which beat Estonia, 75-72, in an exhibition game 
Saturday night, opens the regular season Friday night with a 7:30 p.m. game 
against Pepperdine in the Bren Center. The Waves have beaten the Anteaters five 
times in a row. UCLA will play host to Irvine Monday night. . . . The water 
polo team ended its season Saturday with an 11-10 victory at UC Santa Barbara. 
The Anteaters won six of their last eight games to finish 11-13. It was only 
the second time in 30 years the team has slipped under .500. . . . The men's 
and women's swimming and diving teams will play host to Hawaii at 5 p.m. today 
in Crawford Pool.

LONG BEACH STATE NOTEBOOK / JASON REID; LIGAMENT DAMAGE FORCES COTTON TO SIT 
AWHILE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON REID 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Among the scenarios coaches most fear is losing a top player because of an 
injury during an exhibition game. Unfortunately for Long Beach State, men's 
basketball Coach Seth Greenberg now has experienced it firsthand after an ankle 
injury suffered by sophomore guard James Cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, Big West Conference freshman of the year last season, probably will 
miss several weeks because he severely sprained his left ankle late in the 
team's 96-82 victory over the Mexican national team Friday night at The Gold 
Mine. Cotton, who scored a team-high 20 points, landed awkwardly after making 
an acrobatic layup. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I first saw it, I just knew it was broken," said James Cotton Sr. "The 
way it was bent inward, it looked really bad." 
</P>
<P>
 Initial X-rays revealed no breaks. After two subsequent examinations, Cotton 
learned Monday that he tore ligaments in the ankle. His ankle will be placed in 
a cast today and replaced on Friday with another one that he will wear two 
weeks, Cotton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors want Cotton to undergo an MRI, but he can't until the swelling around 
his ankle decreases. He received therapy Monday for two hours at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm trying to take my mind off of it," Cotton said. "We're just going to see 
what happens, but it seems like it's going to be awhile for me right now." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton, who averaged 11.4 points and 4.2 rebounds a season ago, said he would 
consider being a redshirt this season if sidelined more than a month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would have to be an option," Cotton said. "If I was out for that long, 
then the chemistry on the team would already be built. It would be tough for me 
to come back with all the guys having everything established." 
</P>
<P>
 Cotton's absence, no matter how brief, will have a major impact on the 49ers' 
lineup. At 6 feet 6 and 205 pounds, Cotton is one of the team's best athletes 
and scorers. He is expected to be the focal point of the offense. 
</P>
<P>
 If healthy, Cotton, the 49ers' starting shooting guard, probably would play 
about 35 minutes a game. Now that those minutes must go elsewhere, the coaching 
staff is forced to tinker with several possible lineups, Greenberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, you don't want these things to happen," Greenberg said. "But it's 
such a long season that these things are going to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some good players, and someone is going to have to step up." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bumps, bruises and more: Few things come without a price, and the women's 
volleyball team is already paying for winning its fourth consecutive Big West 
Conference championship last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Several key players who would have been better off resting injuries last week 
were unable to take a break because of the close conference race. Sophomore 
defensive specialist Shawnee Hayes (right knee), freshman outside hitter 
Kristin Harris (groin pull) and senior defensive specialist Prentice Perkins 
(right shoulder) all are feeling the effects of a long season. 
</P>
<P>
 The NCAA tournament begins Nov. 30. Based on past accomplishments, the 
defending national champion 49ers probably have many matches left. 
Understandably, Coach Brian Gimmillaro is somewhat concerned. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are more than nagging injuries," said Gimmillaro, whose team is 22-5 
and ranked sixth in the nation by Volleyball Monthly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some people out there who probably shouldn't have been playing. The 
key to our team is movement in all facets of the game, and we have some key 
people limited because of health." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, visiting Long Beach had enough to defeat No. 12 USC, 15-10, 15-12, 
15-13, Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Problems everywhere: The season is still almost two months away, yet men's 
volleyball Coach Ray Ratelle sees nothing but problems throughout his team. No 
matter the position, Ratelle faces tough questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Most coaches, however, would eagerly welcome Ratelle's, ah, hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our problem is that we've got a lot of good players," Ratelle said. "We've 
got so many good kids with no place to play. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got 12 solid kids. We'd like to get a set lineup, but it's hard because 
so many of the kids do things so well. It's a good problem for (the coaches) 
but it's not good for the kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Ratelle hopes the abundance of talent will help the 49ers regain their place 
among the nation's elite programs. Long Beach won the 1991 NCAA championship 
and lost the '90 title game. Last season, though, the team slipped to 13-15, 
7-12 in the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Six newcomers, including four talented freshmen, have Ratelle feeling good, 
his problem notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll definitely be top 10," said Ratelle, whose team opens the season Jan. 
20 at the UC Santa Barbara Classic. "We've got a lot of kids who do certain 
things well, but we'll play the kids with the most complete packages." 
</P>
<P>
 Junior middle blocker Tom Hoff is the only player guaranteed a starting 
position. Everything else, Ratelle said, is up for grabs. 49er Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The men's golf team took 13th place at the University of Texas Arlington 
Classic. Thomas Hunt finished with the lowest individual score (147). . . . The 
water polo team's nightmarish season, wrecked by injuries and ineligibility, 
ended Saturday with an 8-7 loss at Pepperdine. The team finished 5-19, 0-8 in 
the Mountain Pacific Sports Federation. . . . The women's basketball team lost 
an exhibition game to ELK Estonia, a team from Lithuania, 75-64, Sunday. Senior 
center Melissa Gower scored a game-high 24 points for Long Beach. . . . The 
men's basketball team did well in the early signing period (Nov. 9-16), 
receiving letters of intent from three players: Compton College sophomore 
forward Marcus Johnson (6-8), Long Beach Wilson High forward Michael Batiste 
(6-8) and Lynwood High forward D'Cean Bryant (6-6). . . . About 400 tickets 
remain for the men's opener against Detroit Mercy in The Pyramid on Nov. 30.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Rick Majerus thought his Utah team could beat No. 11 Indiana coming into the 
Maui Invitational. He still thought it when the Utes were saddled by foul 
trouble. He was really proud when they did. 
</P>
<P>
 "We rode some emotion. It was a very hard-fought game and our guys played 
especially hard," Majerus said Monday night after the Utes defeated Indiana, 
77-72, in the opening round of the eight-team tournament at Lahaina. "We had 
foul trouble and I tried some Mickey Mouse zones and things to stem the 
bleeding but I was just so proud of the way our guys stayed in there and played 
down the stretch." 
</P>
<P>
 Brandon Jessie, the son of former Ram receiver Ron Jessie, led the Utes with 
23 points. He is a transfer from Ventura Junior College, where the Lakers' 
Cedric Ceballos was a JC All-American. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah never led until Alex Jensen made two free throws with 4:25 left to make 
the score 61-60. 
</P>
<P>
 The Utes trailed at halftime, 36-32, and pulled even at 55-55 with 8:23 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Down the stretch, Indiana tied the game twice but could never take the lead 
and Utah had it for good at 65-63 on a drive by Van Horn with 3:00 left. The 
closest the Hoosiers got the rest of the way was three points, but both times 
Jessie and Keith Van Horn made both ends of a one and one. 
</P>
<P>
 It was Van Horn, the Utes' leading scorer last season, whom Indiana Coach Bob 
Knight praised the most after the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told our guys when we started talking about Utah that we might not see a 
forward that good for the rest of the year," Knight said. "Utah played very 
well the last five minutes. Van Horn did what outstanding players do in a big 
game and that's make big plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Van Horn, who played only seven minutes in the first half because of foul 
trouble, finished with 15 points. He is a sophomore on a frontline that 
includes two freshmen, Ben Helmeth and Michael Doleac, who each scored 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those freshmen did some job," Majerus said. "I'm just really proud of those 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Henderson led Indiana with 28 and accounted for 17 of the Hoosiers' 36 
points in the second half. Indiana made only 17 of 30 foul shots in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought we would have a tough time with Utah but I didn't necessarily think 
we would lose to them," Knight said. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah will play No. 7 Maryland in the semifinals tonight. The Terrapins easily 
handled Chaminade, 95-67. Joe Smith scored 26 points to lead Maryland, which 
blew the game open with a 32-7 spurt midway through the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 In another first-round game, Mario Bennett was 12 for 13 from the field and 
scored 27 points to lead Arizona State to a 103-73 victory over Texas A&M. The 
Sun Devils will play No. 13 Michigan, which defeated upset-minded Tulane, 
75-73.

COLLEGE DIVISION / ARA NAJARIAN: BAD SIGNS IN PLANE VIEW EARLY FOR LA VERNE 
</P>

<P>
 Maybe it was a sign of things to come. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it was a red light on the dashboard. 
</P>
<P>
 When La Verne's football team flew to Minneapolis for its NCAA Division III 
football game Friday, the pilot had to abort the landing twice. 
</P>
<P>
 The plane landed safely and the players had plenty of rest, but they lost to 
St. John's of Collegeville, Minn., 51-12, on Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it affected the players in terms of the game -- although about 
a half-dozen of the players got sick on the plane," La Verne Coach Rex Huigens 
said. "Believe me, they weren't the only ones. Lots of other passengers were 
reaching for those little bags." 
</P>
<P>
 The plane was close to landing when a wind-shear warning light came on, and 
the pilot pulled up. 
</P>
<P>
 On the second try, the plane in line ahead of the La Verne team's plane 
aborted its landing when winds caused it to suddenly drop 20 feet. So, again, 
the pilot on the plane carrying the players decided to abort. 
</P>
<P>
 They finally landed on a strip at the far side of the airport without a 
problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pilot came on (the public address system) and told us everything that was 
going on, but it was still a pretty difficult ride," Huigens said. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were just as bumpy the next day. 
</P>
<P>
 La Verne was invited to play in its first postseason game after going 9-0 and 
winning the Southern California Intercollegiate Athletic Conference title. It 
was the first time the school had an undefeated season, and the Leopards had 
won 12 consecutive games going back to last season. 
</P>
<P>
 But injuries from the last game of the regular season, a 30-6 victory over 
Occidental, were a factor.  
</P>
<P>
 Running back Darren MacLellan, who led the conference in rushing with 1,379 
yards -- 153.2 a game -- played only one series before it was obvious that his 
knee injury would not allow him to be effective.  
</P>
<P>
 Defensively, strong safety Keith White's knee injury hampered his play.  
</P>
<P>
 Huigens had planned to offset St. John's aggressive linebackers by going to 
wide receiver Anthony Rice if it appeared that they were attacking MacLellan. 
Then, they would go back to MacLellan if St. John's dropped back into pass 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the bottom line is that we got beat by a better team," Huigens said. 
"Their team speed was faster than we thought from our two rolls of game film. 
They would have beat us anyway, but not by that much (were it not for the 
injuries)." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 La Verne's loss was the sixth in seven playoff games by SCIAC teams. Does that 
mean the SCIAC has no business going to the playoffs?  
</P>
<P>
 Not necessarily. 
</P>
<P>
 There are reasons SCIAC teams have had trouble in the playoffs. They do not 
have an automatic bid into the playoffs, and so they usually have to travel. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time a Division III football playoff game was played in Southern 
California was 1983. In that game, Wisconsin La Crosse beat Occidental, 43-42. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the trip (to the Midwest) is worth seven or 10 points -- I really 
do," Huigens said. "The longest trip we made this season was an hour and a 
half." 
</P>
<P>
 Then, when they get where they are going -- usually Wisconsin or Minnesota 
because they are in the same region -- SCIAC teams can expect blustery weather. 
That's not an excuse that coaches like to make, but cold, wind and rain have a 
way of disturbing the passing offenses that dominate the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time a SCIAC team won a playoff game was nine years ago when 
Occidental beat St. John's, 28-10.  
</P>
<P>
 Occidental then lost to Central of Iowa, 70-0, in the quarterfinals. College

 In Division II women's volleyball, Cal State Bakersfield advanced to the third 
round of the NCAA tournament by defeating Cal State L.A. in five games. 
Bakersfield, the top-ranked team in the nation, will play host to the third 
round this Saturday. . . . In the NAIA women's volleyball West Regional final, 
Fresno Pacific defeated Azusa Pacific in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division men's II soccer, Cal State Bakersfield lost in the NCAA 
quarterfinals to Seattle Pacific. The game finished with a score tied, 2-2, but 
Seattle Pacific won on penalty kicks, 3-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Azusa Pacific's men's cross-country team finished fourth at the NAIA 
championship meet at Kenosha, Wis. In the women's competition, Westmont 
finished 14th and Azusa Pacific 16th. . . . Cal State Los Angeles' women's 
cross-country team finished seventh at the NCAA championship meet in Kearney, 
Neb., Saturday. On the men's side, Cal Poly Pomona finished 11th and UC 
Riverside was 16th. . . . In the Division III men's cross-country meet at 
Lehigh, Pa., UC San Diego finished 12th and Occidental 19th. In the women's 
competition, Claremont-Mudd-Scripps finished 19th and Whittier was 21st.

 The Seahawks did some damage after earning an at-large bid to the Southern 
Section Division II-AA playoffs, winning their first-round game, 55-53, in 
overtime against El Monte Mountain View. They pushed fourth-seeded Glendora 
before losing, 58-53. Harris is confident that a return trip to the playoffs is 
probable with this squad. McDonald averaged 10 points in his first varsity 
season and might double that figure. Like many Seahawks, McDonald is an 
aggressive defender and good shooter. Harris has the luxury of depth and size, 
a combination many of his league colleagues wish their teams had. Hanson has a 
nice touch near the basket and should provide a solid defensive presence at 
center. Enriquez can dribble, score and pass -- skills most coaches hope their 
guards possess. Petersen and Wilson provide excellent front-court 
possibilities.

THE PREPS / ERIC SHEPARD: A REAL UPSET IS WHEN 1-9 TEAM BEATS 9-1 TEAM

 A look at the football playoffs, which kicked off with 99 games last weekend: 
</P>
<P>
 Upset I -- Santa Maria, a power in the 1960s and 70s, was 0-9 entering its 
regular-season finale against cross-town rival Righetti on Nov. 11. The Saints 
pulled out a 20-12 victory, and three days later found themselves in the 
Southern Section playoffs thanks to an unusual tie-breaking system in the 
Northern League. 
</P>
<P>
 At 1-9, Santa Maria had the worst record in the playoffs and thus was rewarded 
with a first-round road game against 9-1 Culver City, the top-seeded team in 
Division VII. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I found out we were in the playoffs, I told my staff that I hoped we'd 
draw the top seed in the first round because I knew they'd probably be looking 
past us," Santa Maria Coach Frank Bentz said. "I knew we were playing better 
(than our record), so this is exactly what we needed." 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City was obviously making plans for its next game, as the Centaurs fell 
behind, 33-14, early in the second half. They rallied in the fourth quarter, 
but their final drive ended with four incomplete passes as time expired and 
Santa Maria hung on for a 33-29 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City Coach Robert Moore and his players were speechless after the game, 
the victims of one of the biggest upsets in Southern Section playoff history. 
</P>
<P>
 "Their public address announcer started talking about who they were going to 
play in the quarterfinals, semifinals and championship," Bentz said. "Our kids 
just stood on the field feeling a little disgraced but plenty motivated." 
</P>
<P>
 Culver City suited up 48 players for the game, including highly-recruited 
quarterback/receiver Damon Williams. Santa Maria suited up 21 after losing its 
captain, linebacker Tom Yamamoto, to a knee injury last week. 
</P>
<P>
 Bentz, in his ninth season at the school, said his roster changed from week to 
week because of injuries, grade problems and because several players had to get 
jobs to support their families. Of the three starters who returned this season, 
only running back Alfred Concepcion remains. He rushed for more than 100 yards 
and scored two touchdowns against Culver City. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sure was a short bus trip back to Santa Maria," Bentz said. "I can't 
remember feeling this good." 
</P>
<P>
 Upset II -- Anaheim Loara finished the regular season 4-6, fourth in the 
Empire League. Coach John DeFries was collecting equipment last Wednesday when 
a call came in from the Southern Section office informing him that his team had 
made the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The last-minute invitation was made possible when Placentia El Dorado, one of 
the Empire League's three Division V playoff teams, had to drop out after it 
was discovered the team had used an ineligible player all season. With the 
bracket already set and first-round games two days away, the league and 
section's solution was to replace El Dorado with Loara and move the scheduled 
contest against Anaheim Canyon from Friday to Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 With only two days' preparation, Loara pulled a shocker with a 10-9 victory. 
Junior Rob Crabtree's 18-yard field goal with 13 seconds to play lifted the 
Saxons to the improbable victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Double standards: El Dorado administrators withdrew their football team from 
the playoffs after learning of the ineligibility problem, but La Mirada did not 
receive the same punishment for making the same mistake. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators from La Mirada, the Southern Section's top-seeded Division VIII 
team, discovered on Friday that the school had used an ineligible player all 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadores compete in the Suburban League, and it is up to the principals 
of that league to select playoff entries. Since the principals could not meet 
Friday to discuss the matter, the section decided to allow La Mirada's 
first-round game against Irvine University to go an as scheduled that night. La 
Mirada won, 24-0. 
</P>
<P>
 The principals met Saturday and decided to keep La Mirada in the playoffs, 
saying nothing positive would come out of the team not going on. The player in 
question, a transfer student who was a part-time starter, did not play against 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada's record goes from 11-0 to 1-10. It hosts Duarte Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 That game could change, however, if University has its way. The school is 
appealing the decision to allow La Mirada in the playoffs and a hearing is 
scheduled at 1 p.m. today at the Southern Section office. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduling conflicts: Squabbling over where playoff games should be held is 
normal, so it comes as no surprise that administrators from La Puente Bishop 
Amat and Fontana were bickering Monday concerning their Southern Section 
Division I quarterfinal showdown Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Since both schools won first-round games at home, a coin flip decided who 
would host this week's contest. Bishop Amat won and elected to hold the game at 
its stadium, which holds about 5,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Anticipating a large crowd, Fontana wants the game moved to Mt. San Antonio 
College in Walnut, which holds 12,000. Bishop Amat is not receptive to the 
idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Expect Bill Clark, Southern Section associate commissioner, to make a decision 
today to move the game to Mt. San Antonio College. The section gets half the 
gate receipts and does not want to see anybody get turned away. Times' Top 20

<P>
 The Tillers' run toward the Southern Section Division II-A title ended in the 
semifinals, 70-35, against runner-up Compton Dominguez. Tustin's drive this 
season might go even farther. With four starters and six lettermen back from 
the Sea View League championship team, Tustin should be among the county's -- 
and the Southland's -- best again. Gottlieb runs the show; there aren't many 
better at this level. The Notre Dame-bound Gottlieb averaged 18 points and 8.1 
assists in being selected all-county by The Times. David Lalazarian (14 points) 
benefits from Gottlieb's presence but has a nice shooting touch and solid 
instincts of his own. Ground is excited about Griffin, a gunner with incredible 
range who excelled for the junior varsity last season (24 points). "We should 
be able to play eight or nine," Ground said, "with no drop off in ability."

 An assistant for eight seasons, Dickson enters his second season at the Lions' 
controls with high expectations. "This could be one of the better teams we've 
had here in a while," he said. "The chemistry is real good. I think we could 
have a really good season." Much of Dickson's optimism is based on the play of 
Steele. The swingman averaged 10 points last season and Dickson believes he's 
ready to make an even bigger contribution this season. Yoshizaki, the point 
guard, makes the offense work. A skilled ballhandler, he averaged six points 
and six assists. The latter figure might rise sharply. Mizufuka contributes 
strong defense. Boorman, whose family recently moved to the area from Nevada, 
is expected to start at center. He's probably the team's strongest player.

<P>
 Haskell, a former head coach at Savanna and assistant at Trabuco Hills, has 
experienced success. He guided Savanna to a 16-9 record and the 
tri-championship of the Orange League in 1991-92, his only season at the 
school. However, with no returning starters from a team that was last in the 
Sea View League, well, Haskell isn't predicting similar results in his first 
year as the Roadrunners' leader. "This could be a tough year," Haskell said. 
"Scoring will be a real challenge. Most of the kids are up from the lower 
levels and they didn't have a lot of success there. This is a team that has a 
very small margin for error." Chapman and Frierson should provide some 
stability at forward. They were among the junior varsity team's top players. 
Gallegos, Neang and Ochoa will compete for the starting backcourt jobs. Dreyer 
is a physical player who should receive many minutes at forward and possibly 
center. Despite his inexperience, Doung is also in the mix for substantial 
minutes in the backcourt.

 Size won't be a Saints' strength, but Walker is not especially worried because 
this group is quick and determined, two attributes most coaches appreciate. "I 
expect intense defense," Walker said, "and great hustle." Martinez leads the 
attack. He developed quickly while starting as a sophomore and improved during 
the summer. Martinez has a knack for being in the right place and he knows how 
Walker wants things done. Walker believes Martinez will dramatically increase 
his scoring (5.9 average). Likewise, Rivero is counted on for points. One of 
the junior varsity team's top players, Rivero can handle the ball and create 
scoring opportunities for others. Anthony Garcia most likely will get the 
starting job at center. Because of Santa Ana's lack of interior strength, he'll 
have to grab his share of rebounds -- and then some. If Martinez, Rivero and 
Garcia come through, Santa Ana might earn a playoff berth.

 Santa Margarita soundly thumped Servite, 67-53, in the Southern Section 
Division III-AA championship game. However, the deep, talented Friars might 
play themselves into another section title game this season. Servite and Tustin 
are co-favorites to take the league's first championship. A dominant player 
near the basket, the Stanford-bound Seaton is in his fourth year on the 
varsity. He averaged 10 points, seven rebounds and two blocks as a junior. 
Hamilton believes that Downs, a three-year varsity member, is one of the 
county's most underrated players. He averaged 12 points and eight rebounds. 
Peter Martinelli was promoted from the junior varsity for the playoffs and 
didn't disappoint. A skilled ballhandler, Martinelli has no competition at 
point guard. How well he handles his new status early is a key.

SCOTT HARRIS: COMING SOON: STARDOM IN CYBERSPACE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HARRIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Many moons ago, when e-mail was something new and exciting at the big company 
that employs me, I learned a lesson about its wonders and its pitfalls. 
</P>
<P>
 The wonders were indeed wonderful. You've heard, no doubt, about how nerds 
find romance in cyberspace. Once, that happened to me. 
</P>
<P>
 She was a colleague in another office, an acquaintance more than a friend. An 
exchange of messages led to dinner, which led to more, which lasted about a 
year. A decade later, we're still friends. No regrets. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, almost. You see, a few weeks after that first dinner, a nosy friend 
e-mailed me about this relationship. Now, this friend -- a woman, I should add 
-- happens to have a racy sense of humor, which was in ample evidence in her 
message. Chuckling to myself, I composed a bawdy response in kind, and reached 
for the "send" button. 
</P>
<P>
 It was at that moment, a millisecond before contact, that I noticed I had 
inadvertently typed my sweetie's name in the "send to" field, not my nosy 
friend's. And it was too late: My finger depressed the send key even as my 
brain cried "Oh, darn!" (or words to that effect). In panic, I idiotically 
tapped "cancel" six or seven times, even though I realized that messages, once 
sent, could not be retrieved. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon I was on the phone, saying "I'm sorry" as often as I tapped the cancel 
button. 
</P>
<P>
 My sweetheart was not amused. But she was, eventually, forgiving. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 I offer this tale to explain the mixture of excitement and trepidation with 
which I face my new assignment in cyberspace. People who read this newspaper 
closely, and especially those of you who subscribe to Prodigy on your personal 
computer, are probably aware of TimesLink. It's the company's latest idea for 
making money -- I mean, for providing a valuable service at a reasonable price. 
(Hey, I'm in the employee stock plan.) 
</P>
<P>
 The fear started a few weeks ago, when an editor known as Big Guy called me 
into his office. He explained to me that editors who might collectively be 
called Even Bigger Guys and Gals want columnists to be active participants in 
TimesLink. Big Guy explained that readers might send me e-mail and that the 
company would appreciate it if I would respond from time to time. 
</P>
<P>
 Big Guy even told me about an electronic "bulletin board" called "Ask Scott 
Harris" and he said that, once TimesLink is hitting on all six cylinders, I 
might even participate in a "chat room." Now, I'm not too clear on the concept, 
but I'm told this is the information superhighway equivalent of live talk 
radio. Apparently there'll come a time when, at the appointed hour on the 
appointed day, readers and I can send messages back and forth, exchanging 
insights or insults or whatever. 
</P>
<P>
 Now all of this sounded like it might be fun. It also sounded like a fair 
amount of work, especially since I'm not much of a computer jockey and would 
need hours of training. Anyway, I told Big Guy, "Sure," before thinking to ask 
the reasonable question of whether extra work would mean extra pay. This 
injustice may not be addressed when "Ask Scott Harris" is the hottest thing in 
cyberspace. But by then I'll be represented by Ovitz. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, someday fans will call it "ASH," the same way people now casually say 
"Rush." Judging from the early response, however, it may take a while. 
</P>
<P>
 At my first TimesLink lesson, we looked into the ASH heap. 
</P>
<P>
 "Scott, where do babies come from?"  
</P>
<P>
 This was my very first question. Turned out to be a joke -- a message from a 
co-worker I now think of as Smart Guy. Another early message came from my old 
friend Gil Chesterton, the journalism adviser at Beverly Hills High School. He 
just wanted to say hello. 
</P>
<P>
 It was reassuring to find a few messages from people I don't know personally. 
Mostly they pertained to illegal immigration and Mayor Riordan's failure to 
announce a position on Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 I sent a few replies, but something about it didn't feel right. It wasn't like 
the old days of e-mail, when our hearts were young and spring was in the air. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The company has assigned me a password, a seemingly random concoction of seven 
letters or digits. Then there's a second password that I've assigned myself. I 
can't sign on to TimesLink at the simple computer at my desk, but have to look 
for one of those hifalutin machines that are scattered here and there. I'm not 
utterly clueless -- I'm not, as the metaphor goes, "roadkill on the information 
superhighway" -- but I do wish it were simpler. 
</P>
<P>
 My first paying job in journalism was as a copy boy, when the clatter of 
typewriters filled the newsroom. Among my jobs was filling the glue pots. Copy 
editors would mark up typewritten stories with pencils and glue the typewritten 
pages into long scrolls. After a final look by an editor, the stories would be 
impaled on a metal spike that extended from a heavy base. I would then "clean 
the spike" and "tube the copy" -- that is, place the scrolls into plastic 
vessels to be sent by pneumatic tube to the back shop. 
</P>
<P>
 The technology has changed so much so fast that people now envision the day 
when your daily news will arrive via microwave to your portable laptop -- and 
laptops will be as cheap, as necessary and as commonplace as the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 And that's when ASH will be huge. 
</P>
<P>
 But remember, if something I say offends you, there's a good chance it was 
meant for somebody else. 
</P>

<P>
 Cal State Fullerton will play host to an NCAA soccer playoff game for the 
second consecutive week when the Titans meet the University of San Francisco at 
1 p.m. Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco surprised Fresno State, the Mountain Pacific Soccer Assn. 
champion ranked fourth nationally by Soccer America, in the first round 
Sunday.The Dons won on penalty kicks, 3-1, after the game ended, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, ranked 13th, eliminated the University of San Diego for the second 
consecutive season, winning, 3-1, in overtime Saturday night in Titan Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton Coach Al Mistri said Monday that goalkeeper Mike Kornock and 
midfielder Martin Palos, who were suspended for the San Diego game for 
disciplinary reasons, would be allowed to return for Sunday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 Justin Johnston, who started at goalkeeper for the Titans Saturday, will 
continue in the No. 1 spot, Mistri said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mistri said midfielder Adrian Cortes, who was injured late in Saturday's game, 
will be out the rest of the season because of torn ligaments in his ankle. LON

VALLEY ROUNDUP; MEXICAN BOXER OUT OF BOUT AT WARNER CENTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The World Boxing Council's demand that Mexican fighters boycott title fights 
in California has prompted a change in tonight's boxing card at the Warner 
Center Marriott. 
</P>
<P>
 Felipe Garcia has replaced Adolfo Castillo in the 10-round main event.He will 
face Rudy Zavala, who needs a victory to retain his WBC Continental Americas 
featherweight title and maintain his place as a challenger to WBC world 
champion Kevin Kelly. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo, from Tamulitas, Mexico, canceled after the WBC threatened sanctions 
against Mexican fighters who compete in California. 
</P>
<P>
 Jose Sulaiman, president of the WBC, announced the ban last week to protest 
the passage of Proposition 187, which, if enforced, would cut off an estimated 
1.7 million illegal immigrants from receiving education, welfare and 
non-emergency medical aid in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The boycott will last until at least March 30, and then be reviewed, Sulaiman 
said. The WBC is the largest of several international boxing bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Castillo has a record of 19-12-1. Garcia, 11-8-1 with seven victories by 
knockout, is not as technically polished as Castillo. Zavala, a former 
super-bantamweight world champion, is 23-4-2, with 19 victories by knockout. 
</P>
<P>
 Rocky Pepeli (18-8-1, 16 KOs) of Simi Valley meets Craig Brinson (3-3-2, two 
KOs) of Duarte in a heavyweight bout scheduled for eight rounds. 
</P>
<P>
 In the undercard fights, Anthony Johnson (8-1, two KOs) faces Jose Ferrer 
(6-5-1, four KOs) in an eight-round lightweight bout; Fili Castro (9-0, eight 
KOs) meets Yoani Cervantes (4-5, two KOs) in a six-round welterweight bout; 
Santiago Negro Franco (4-3, three KOs) faces Canoga Park's Don Goodwin (1-3, 
one KO) in a four-round super-welterweight bout; and Paul Mayorquinn (4-0-1, 
one KO) meets Jimmy Navarro (1-0) in a four-round junior lightweight bout.

 Cal State Northridge safety Joe Vaughn, a senior from Sylmar, has been named 
American West Conference Defensive Player of the Year. Vaughn tied a school 
record with nine interceptions this year and broke the NCAA Division I-AA 
record for interception return yardage. 
</P>
<P>
 Matador quarterback J.J. O'Laughlin, receiver Duc Ngo, offensive lineman Edvin 
Babayova and kicker Matt Ornelaz also made the first-team offense. Defensive

 The Nordhoff High girls' tennis team might consider throwing in its rackets 
right now, because recent history suggests the Rangers will have little chance 
in their Southern Section Division V team championship match. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the third time really is a charm, Nordhoff (14-6) could upset 
fourth-seeded La Reina (15-3) in the 2 p.m. showdown today at the Ojai Valley 
Racquet Club. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wiped us off the court," Nordhoff Coach Rose Boggs said. "Now it depends 
on what the girls want to do. They've improved. It's just how they perform 
under pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 For La Reina, sisters Kristy Bear (30-2), a sophomore, and Cindy Bear (25-7), 
a senior, alternate at Nos. 1 and 2 singles. Kristin Dickey is 30-3 at No. 3 
singles. The No. 1 doubles team of Katie Nelson and Vicki Hull (66-0) have not 
lost a match in two seasons. DANA HADDAD

 In the aftermath of the victory of Proposition 187, an installation by Richard 
Lou and Robert Sanchez at the Saddleback College Gallery gains added irony, 
though it still suffers from problems of tone and presentation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Anthropolocos: New Digs at Mission Viejo -- In Search of the Colorless 
Hands" (through Dec. 15) is a tongue-in-cheek archeological study -- undertaken 
in the distant future -- of an extinct people known as the Colorless. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of latex gloves stamped with numbers and strung up on nails on the 
walls are presented as the contents of each dig, along with various partially 
disemboweled household implements presumably used by the Colorless. At 
intervals, a buzzer sounds and a blue light flashes over a sandbox: the 
anthropological dig as blue-light special. 
</P>
<P>
 The conceptual glue of the piece consists of texts that turn anti-minority 
stereotypes on their heads. The Colorless, whose culture "did not value work 
(or) encourage ambition or initiative," are blamed for social problems ranging 
from lower test scores and drug abuse to such "bland and inane music" as "Achy 
Breaky Hand." 
</P>
<P>
 The texts soberly report a somewhat confusing array of scams ranging from 
self-mutilation (severed hands qualifying Colorless individuals for disability 
payments) to stolen Colorless body parts used by one Freddy "El Dahmer Prieto" 
Jiminez as sexual fetishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lou and Sanchez will be remembered for their installation "Entrance Is Not 
Acceptance" at the Third Newport Biennial in 1991. Mass media images displayed 
within a jury-rigged labyrinth the viewer could walk through represented an 
attempt at re-creating visceral aspects of the undocumented worker's plight in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "Suspended Text: A Border Matrix," shown in San Diego the same year, also 
involved media imagery and a confining physical exercise (pushing oneself on a 
wheeled platform). 
</P>
<P>
 This time out, the "crazy anthropologists" already have done the physical work 
-- the digging -- and viewers need only apply their minds. But the artists seem 
not to have realized that a piece so dependent on texts required more attention 
to the nuances of language. 
</P>
<P>
 As the piece stands, the "theories" read more like unrehearsed stand-up comedy 
material -- complete with a grammatical error or two -- than parodies of 
genuine anthropological style. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The other major problem is that the texts and the objects don't support one 
another; each portion of the piece exists in its separate little universe of 
parodic style. 
</P>
<P>
 The orderly grid of numbered latex gloves soberly recalls the tidy certainties 
-- the bloodlessness, you might say -- of applied science. The dismembered 
household objects are (deliberately?) lame attempts to re-create aspects of 
civilization recognizably like our own but somehow weirdly different. The 
blue-light effect might be a pop-culture reference to the media-age marketing 
of dubious morsels of information. The texts go off on their own 
discombobulated trip. Somewhere in all this, there is the germ of a keen parody 
of racist shortsightedness, but it needs some rethinking and retooling.

 DEAD BOLTS: "Dia de los Muertos," a juried show closing Friday at the Orange 
County Center for Contemporary Art, contains a wide variety of works 
celebrating life by remembering the dead. A few pieces seem especially 
promising. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Generations," Anne Wolf establishes a stark scene of torture and death in 
prison with starkly minimal means. Anita Rodriguez's painting "Ibrahim Medina" 
invokes the life and death of a loving couple out for a joy ride with a sweetly 
lyrical style incorporating equal parts of gossamer fantasy and down-to-earth 
detail. Rita Maria Amaya's subtly lit silver prints of a dying lily ("Death of 
Grace") embody simple truths about the short life of beauty.

 PEACE MEAL: It's hard to make compelling anti-war art in an era when the media 
are constantly exposing us to global atrocity. Although David Settino Scott -- 
whose work is at the recently expanded Fullerton College Art Gallery through 
Friday -- attempts to shock the viewer into pained awareness, his works are too 
cliched, derivative or prettified to be effective. 
</P>
<P>
 A massive, altar-like painting ("The Practice of Art") is utterly dependent on 
the hell imagery of Hieronymous Bosch, weakly updated with modern implements of 
war. Scott's brushy, blandly nostalgic painting style enfeebles individual 
works showing tranquil, suburban settings with tiny, anonymous-looking bodies 
that have been dismembered or hanged. Although his drawing style is much more 
vital and engaged, the images in a series called "Obscenities" -- missiles as 
excrement and sexual appendages, and so forth -- already have been done to 
death. * Fullerton College Art Gallery, 321 E. Chapman Ave., Fullerton; through 
Friday, 10 a.m. to 2 p.m.; admission free. (714) 992-7317.)

POP MUSIC REVIEW; REUNION TAKES A WHILE TO GET GO-GO-ING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sure, it's pretentious for a band to make its stage entrance to a blaring tape 
of "Also Sprach Zarathustra," but perhaps that pomp is justified when the 
timpani are drowned out by the tumult of the standing ovation greeting the 
band. 
</P>
<P>
 So the Go-Go's reclaimed the concert stage after nearly a 10-year absence 
(discounting a 1990 mini-tour), kicking off a short reunion tour Sunday at the 
Coach House (they also play the Wiltern in Los Angeles on Dec. 1 and 2). 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, the Los Angeles quintet was the first to prove that an all-female 
rock band could be successful, topping the charts with dolled-up garage rock. 
The members then proved they were also equal to their male counterparts in 
substance abuse, infighting and other band-wrecking skills. That led to the 
Go-Go's disbanding in 1985 and, subsequently, to some grim solo careers. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're back to prove that females, too, can cash in on their legacies. 
But though they've regrouped to promote a new hits package -- "a great 
Christmas gift," bassist Kathy Valentine reminded the crowd -- their 90-minute 
performance was far from being just a money run. 
</P>
<P>
 From the get-go, compact powerhouse Gina Schock wore an infectious grin and 
attacked her drums with great vigor. Too bad the rest of the band was facing 
away from her, for, despite her pounding beat, they got off to a tentative 
start. 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Belinda Carlisle -- whose voice was obviously filled-out by digital 
harmonizing effects at the sound board -- seemed neither to connect with the 
lyrics of the first several songs nor particularly to land on the right notes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There was scarcely more musical precision from Valentine, guitarist Jane 
Wiedlin (sporting short, green-tinged black hair) and ex-Bangle Vicki Peterson 
on lead guitar (subbing for a pregnant Charlotte Caffey). One new song, "Good 
Girl," got a decent, if uninspiring, airing, while "Vacation" scarcely got on 
the road, given Carlisle and the band's ragged delivery. 
</P>
<P>
 But their shortcomings either vanished or ceased to matter by the seventh 
song, when they kicked into groove with the effervescent power pop of "This 
Town." 
</P>
<P>
 The show was pure party from that point on, with band members bouncing around 
the stage, exchanging laughs and seeming to remember the pleasure it is all 
supposed to be. The audience was way ahead of them, up and dancing to nearly 
every song in the 21-song set. 
</P>
<P>
 The set spanned the group's early, rough pre-fame numbers like "Fashion 
Seekers" and "Playing With Ropes" to songs composed for the new hits package, a 
double CD titled "Return to the Valley of the Go-Go's." 
</P>
<P>
 Those songs show promise for the full-fledged reunion the group says it is 
intending this time, especially "Beautiful," a song detailing an idyllic "bed 
of roses" life, given an edge by Carlisle's vocal, which pitched the lyrics 
somewhere between affirmation and irony. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is such unexpected balances that may be the hallmark of the Go-Go's. Their 
early efforts were a mix of punky drive and bittersweet pop confection, while 
later efforts still had a garage sensibility lurking under the smooth 
production values. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sunday, they played with a palpable punch on their old stage burners "Cool 
Jerk," "Our Lips Are Sealed," "Get Up and Go" and "Lust to Love" as well as on 
the Ramones' "I Wanna Be Sedated," aptly closing the show with "Let's Have a 
Party." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Opening act That Dog didn't seem to want for much, except perhaps a reason to 
exist. The quartet includes the teen-aged daughters of Warner Bros. Records 
executive Lenny Waronker (Anna Waronker) and jazz bassist Charlie Haden (twins 
Petra and Rachel Haden). The group is completed by drummer Tony Maxwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite their youth and the shadow of famous parents, the group's 12-song set 
had an abundance of self-assurance and musical ideas. Though sometimes awry, 
the vocal harmonies were usually rich and inventive, while the musical backing 
effortlessly shifted from feedback-spattered grind to soft violin pastorals. 
</P>
<P>
 It was all very clever, but, without much evident emotion behind their 
constructs, their set grew thin long before it ended. Even so, they were a lot 
more fun than Wilson-Phillips, and they may be more worth watching a couple of 
years hence.

THEATER REVIEW; SUBDUED TONE IN TANNER'S 'DIAGHILEV' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By F. KATHLEEN FOLEY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With stage credits stretching back for decades and ranging from London's West 
End to Broadway and beyond, British actor Tony Tanner epitomizes the term "old 
trouper." 
</P>
<P>
 His stock-in-trade, judging from his extensive resume, is comedy, the kind 
with a music-hall bent. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, in his one-man show "Diaghilev" at West Coast Ensemble, Tanner 
brings little of his comedic abilities to bear. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that one expects a play about the great Russian ballet impresario to be 
camp. Flamboyant, yes. This is an oddly subdued Diaghilev who speaks to us from 
beyond the grave. The afterlife, he is pleased to inform us, is a lot like an 
opulent hotel room in Venice. In this antechamber to the unknown, Diaghilev 
reminisces about his life, career and great love -- the virtuosic ballet dancer 
and choreographer Vaslav Nijinsky. 
</P>
<P>
 Tanner, who wrote the piece and directed himself in it, has an impeccable 
Russian accent and formidable poise. However, it's as if someone turned down 
the energy level on his performance. Only occasionally lively, Tanner drifts 
into lulling, virtually whispered cadences that in combination with the dryness 
of his material have a decidedly soporific effect. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Diaghilev laments, "I can't do anything." Always the dilettante, 
never the artist, Diaghilev had the unparalleled ability to recognize and 
nurture talent -- luminaries such as Cocteau, Picasso, Stravinsky, to name a 
few. Of course, Diaghilev's greatest find was Nijinsky -- but Tanner devotes 
the lion's share of his show to a chronological narrative of Nijinsky's stellar 
rise and sad decline into madness. Continually bemoaning his lost love, 
Tanner's Diaghilev is annoyingly woebegone.  
</P>
<P>
 A bit more bombast, a few fresh anecdotes, and a lot more cheekiness would go 
far toward waking up this somnolent production. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Diaghilev," West Coast Ensemble, 6240 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood. 
Tuesdays-Wednesdays, 8 p.m. Ends Nov . 30. $14. (213) 466-1767. Running time: 2 
hours.

MUSIC REVIEW; SOUTHWEST CHAMBER SOCIETY AT CHAPMAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SUSAN BLISS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southwest Chamber Music Society reasserted its tradition of animated 
performances of 20th-Century works Sunday afternoon in Orange, with a 
stimulating program of music by Britten, Shostakovich and Donald Crockett. 
</P>
<P>
 The most recent was Crockett's attractive 1990 "Celestial Mechanics," for oboe 
and string quartet, recipient of second prize in the 1991 Kennedy Center 
Friedheim Awards.According to the USC faculty member, who attended the concert, 
his inspiration stemmed from the Oboe Quartet of Mozart and the virtuosic 
playing of the Los Angeles Chamber Orchestra's principal oboist, Allan Vogel. 
</P>
<P>
 On this occasion -- in Salmon Recital Hall, at Chapman University -- Stuart 
Horn neatly filled the role designed for Vogel. During the first of two 
movements, and again toward the close of the second, he brought elegant 
intelligence to the woodwind's staunchly lyrical role, against -- sometimes 
subsumed by -- the strings' more aggressive stance. 
</P>
<P>
 The five players -- including violinists Peter Marsh and Susan Jensen, violist 
Jan Karlin and cellist Roger Lebow -- skipped through the jaunty patter of the 
final movement in crisply articulated, buoyant rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 Most weighty of the three works on the roster, Shostakovich's String Quartet 
No. 15, Opus 144 -- his last in that genre -- proved the most difficult to knit 
into a convincing whole. Relentless in its seeming obsession with death, the 
quartet holds to a dirgelike adagio throughout, and rarely engages all four 
musicians at once. Here, a series of solos -- often somber, Angst- ridden and 
moving -- resulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Britten's Phantasy, Opus 2, for oboe and string trio (Horn and the quartet, 
minus violinist Jensen) flourished in taut and evocative ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 The same program had been presented Friday night in Pasadena.

MUSIC REVIEW; SOPRANO SYLVIA MCNAIR DELIVERS EFFORTLESSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Soprano Sylvia McNair can sing Purcell with the immediacy of a classy Jerome 
Kern tune and Andre Previn with the poise of a baroque aria. Her voice is warm, 
even, focused and flexible, and her delivery, as heard in a program that also 
included works by Mozart, Schubert, Debussy and Bizet on Saturday in Marsee 
Auditorium at the South Bay Center for the Arts, is unaffected and deceptively 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Mansfield, Ohio, she also remains very much an American singer in her 
idiomatic vocal handling of the language and in the American mixed and sliding 
vowel sounds that occasionally creep into her singing. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was nothing provincial about her artistry. 
</P>
<P>
 She sang three Purcell songs and his semi-dramatic scena "The Blessed Virgin's 
Expostulation" with haunting sweetness and persuasive involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 Previn's Four Songs (to words by Toni Morrison) showed a range from saucy 
Annie-Get-Your-Gun feminism to vulnerable confession. (Frances Steiner played 
the cello obbligatos with lean, amber tone.) 
</P>
<P>
 She was effortlessly secure and bright in the challenges of Mozart's concert 
aria, "Misera! dove son," K. 369, although less than ideally dramatic. Beauty 
of tone took precedence here over expression of textual urgency. 
</P>
<P>
 She was also secure in five seemingly simple Italian songs by Schubert that 
expose limitations as readily as arie antiche. None was exposed. 
</P>
<P>
 She sang Debussy's "Ariettes oubliees" with nuance and enunciation of model 
clarity. But she seemed freer in two songs by Bizet -- the impetuous yet 
hesitant youth in "La Coccinelle," and the elegantly spun-out filigree in 
"Tarentelle." 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the program, pianist Hal France provided discreet accompaniment. 
</P>
<P>
 For the single encore, McNair sang Leonard Bernstein's "I Hate Music."

THE WEEK AHEAD: WASHINGTON; ZEDILLO MEETS CLINTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mexican President-elect Ernesto Zedillo will meet Wednesday with President 
Clinton during the final stop on a pre-inauguration tour of the Americas. 
</P>
<P>
 The two are expected to discuss law-enforcement reform and the recurring 
U.S.-Mexico subjects of immigration and trade. On the agenda is expected to be 
Proposition 187, adopted by California voters, which the government in Mexico 
City sees as a move against its country, the third-largest U.S. export market 
and Washington's partner in the North American Free Trade Agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Zedillo visited Central America earlier this month and will meet today with 
Canadian Prime Minister Jean Chretien in Ottawa. Zedillo takes office Dec. 1, 
succeeding Carlos Salinas de Gortari.

ENVIRONMENT; PARKS UNDER SIEGE IN LATIN AMERICA; HUMAN INVASIONS ARE 
THREATENING ISLANDS OF NATURAL WONDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By WILLIAM R. LONG and MAC MARGOLIS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Deep within this 2.2-million-acre reserve, smoke billowed up from the lap of a 
forested hill where Raul Romero was burning felled trees. 
</P>
<P>
 He was clearing virgin forest to plant rice to feed his family. In a year or 
two, when the weak tropical soil no longer is good for grain, he will probably 
replace the rice with coca bushes. Coca leaves, the raw material of cocaine, 
are Romero's only cash crop. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no other work for us in this place," the 43-year-old Romero said as 
smoke from the burning trees swirled around him and his son, Freddy. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of farmers like Romero have taken over a 250,000-acre corner of 
Isiboro-Secure National Park, slashing and burning to plant patches of coca. 
Depredation of wilderness reserves is illegal and pitiable, but not unusual in 
Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Known for its vast rain forests, majestic Andean mountains and other natural 
splendors, this region of the continent does not lack national parks and 
reserves -- at least on paper. But as Latin America's population edges toward 
500 million, and pressure on its natural resources grows, "protected areas" 
from Mexico to Argentina are coming under increasing assault from poaching, 
lumbering, mining, tourism, ranching and farming. 
</P>
<P>
 Internationally known areas where parks and preserves are in serious trouble 
include the Amazon rain forest and Pantanal wetlands of Brazil, Machu Picchu 
and the Manu River in Peru, the Galapagos Islands of Ecuador, the Sierra Nevada 
de Santa Marta mountains in Colombia, the Peten forest of Guatemala and the 
Lacandon rain forest of Mexico.  
</P>
<P>
 Poverty, ignorance and corruption all contribute to the destruction. But James 
Nations, a vice president of Conservation International, said the most 
immediate problem is funding -- "to hire the park guards, to buy the jeeps and 
to equip the conservation employees that should be out there on the ground 
patrolling areas and working with local people who live around the edges of 
those protected areas so that they have an economic alternative to destroying 
the park." 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign governments and non-governmental organizations, or NGOs, are providing 
millions of dollars a year to help protect Latin American natural areas, but it 
is not nearly enough. Foreign NGOs, including Conservation International, are 
also helping to create and support local NGOs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The positive response is bigger every year, but the threats are also bigger 
every year," Nations said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some examples of the Latin American parks and preserves under pressure: 
BOLIVIA 
</P>
<P>
 The Isiboro-Secure, Bolivia's biggest park, is a lush expanse of subtropical 
forests and savannas, lakes and Amazon tributaries in the heart of South 
America. Its southern boundary meets the Chapare, one of the main coca-growing 
areas in South America. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Chapare filled up with coca growers in the 1980s, and as U.S. and 
Bolivian authorities pressed farmers to give up cultivation of the crop there, 
many growers moved into the more secluded Isiboro-Secure. Now, even the park's 
Indian inhabitants cut down trees to grow coca. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't have that, we don't eat," said Candido Ortega, a Yuracare native. 
Indians used to hunt wild animals for meat, but with the southern end of the 
park full of farmers, most of the game there is gone. 
</P>
<P>
 Farmer and Indian groups last year agreed on a "red line" limiting further 
penetration by settlers. Indians patrol the line, a 93-mile pathway across the 
park. BRAZIL 
</P>
<P>
 The Mata Atlantica, or Atlantic Forest, stretches along Brazil's entire 
coastline, harboring many unique species, including the largest primate in the 
Americas, the Uriqui monkey. Conservation International has designated the Mata 
Atlantica as the world's most threatened ecosystem after the tropical forests 
of Madagascar. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Monte Paschoal National Park, an area of the Mata Atlantica in the 
state of Bahia, remnants of the forest are threatened by encroaching farmers 
and by Pataxo Indians, whose reservation borders on the park. The natives 
practice slash-and-burn agriculture and cut the park's trees to produce 
charcoal. By unofficial estimates, nearly half of the park's 100,000 acres has 
been deforested. 
</P>
<P>
 In Brazil's enormous Amazon region, a plan for preserving large tracts of rain 
forest as "extractive reserves" is also running into problems. 
Environmentalists promoted preservation of big areas for extracting natural 
products such as rubber, Brazil nuts and wood dyes, which would give the 
reserves' inhabitants an income from indigenous trees and plants.  
</P>
<P>
 But depressed prices for natural latex have made rubber-tapping unprofitable, 
and forest dwellers have had difficulty meeting orders for Brazil nuts. As a 
result, the extractive reserves seem doomed. 
</P>
<P>
 IBAMA, the government environmental agency, has four staffers to oversee the 
Mato Grosso National Park's 333,000 acres, straddling the Pantanal wetlands and 
Cerrado scrublands in western Brazil, a favorite hunting ground for poachers in 
search of hides and pelts. Many of the area's wildlife species -- such as 
spotted jaguar, caiman, guara wolf, and Pantanal deer -- are growing scarce. 
ECUADOR 
</P>
<P>
 A growing tourist trade in the Galapagos Islands, a renowned national park 650 
miles off Ecuador's Pacific Coast, is putting severe pressure on the unique 
array of wildlife, which includes giant land tortoises, dragon-like lava 
iguanas, blue-footed boobies and 14 kinds of finches. About 46,000 tourists 
visited the islands in 1993, nine times the number two decades ago. An official 
protective limit of 12,000 tourists a year is ignored. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Ecuadorians looking for jobs in tourism have swollen the local 
population, more than doubling the 1982 population of 6,200. 
</P>
<P>
 The tourist invasion of natural habitats, poaching by local residents and 
increasing numbers of domestic animals -- as well as rats -- are taking a 
worrisome toll on the natural flora and fauna. COLOMBIA 
</P>
<P>
 Hector Vargas, the chief warden of Tayrona National Park, was shot and killed 
in September by unknown assailants. He was the sixth park official in Tayrona 
to be killed in the last 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Government officials and environmental activists say the violence in the 
17,000-acre Tayrona park and in the nearby 946,000-acre Sierra Nevada de Santa 
Marta National Park are the product of a caldron of conflicting forces in the 
region, including drug traffickers, guerrillas, paramilitary groups and illegal 
settlers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because of a lack of governability and an inadequate presence of the state, 
many parks have become unmanageable," Environment Minister Cecilia Lopez said. 
Some of the worst problems can be seen in the Sierra Nevada region, a detached 
mountain chain 18 miles from the Caribbean coast that is home to 30,000 
Indians. 
</P>
<P>
 The marijuana boom of the 1970s led to the deforestation of thousands of acres 
inside the Sierra Nevada park by growers planting the weed, and led to the 
drying up of rivers in summer and massive flooding in the winter. The later 
cocaine boom brought coca growers and smugglers. MEXICO 
</P>
<P>
 Indian communities in the two biosphere reserves that Mexico has created to 
preserve the Lacandon rain forest in the southernmost state of Chiapas were 
appalled to learn this autumn that the Agriculture Ministry had given two 
neighboring farm communities permission to clear damaged trees out of the 
reserves. The Group of 100, a loose-knit organization of intellectuals 
concerned about the environment, has charged that uncontrolled lumbering of 
precious woods is taking place in the reserves as a result of the permits. 
</P>
<P>
 The fight over lumbering is part of an ongoing battle in the Lacandon. In 
1978, it appeared that the Indians had won when the 818,000-acre Montes Azules 
biosphere reserve was established. It became the first of 23 biosphere reserves 
the Mexican government would establish, in addition to 44 national parks. 
</P>
<P>
 But Montes Azules and Lacatun, a 152,800-acre reserve added nearby, exist only 
on maps. Settlers of Santa Helena village were told two decades ago that they 
had to move out of the reserve, but they remain. In the planting season, they 
clear land with machetes. When the fragile jungle topsoil gives out, they cut 
trees farther afield. Only 10% of what was a 3.2 million-acre jungle in 1875 
still exists. All but 6% has been lost since 1960. GUATEMALA 
</P>
<P>
 The Mayan Biosphere Reserve was created in 1990 but only really began to 
function as a reserve in 1992. It covers 3.9 million acres of the Peten jungle 
bordering Mexico and Belize plus a 1.2 million-acre buffer zone, and is the 
largest remaining tropical rain forest in Mesoamerica. With the buffer zone 
included, it is the size of El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only does the park contain a vast treasure of biodiversity, it encloses 
the Tikal ruins and many ancient Mayan sites that generate more than $30 
million a year in tourist revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 The park is administered by the National Commission for Protected Areas. The 
U.S. Agency for International Development has contributed $10 million for a 
park fund, but the commission gets only $90,000 a year, says Milton Cabrera, a 
commission official. "It is a toy budget, no more than symbolic." COSTA RICA 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the fame of its national park system, Costa Rica has one of the 
highest deforestation rates in Central America. Forty years ago, about 80% of 
Costa Rica was covered in trees; today, it's 25%, all of which is in national 
parks and preserves. 
</P>
<P>
 A boom in tourism also threatens parks and wildlife. Costa Rica wants the 
tourists, but hotel construction and the increased tourist loads are destroying 
much of what the visitors are coming to see. In the Monteverde Cloud Forest, 
the famous golden toad and some other amphibian species have disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 The 26,000-acre forest receives 20,000 tourists a year. Animals such as the 
colorful quetzal bird have moved deeper into the forest and are harder to see. 
PERU 
</P>
<P>
 Manu National Park in southeastern Peru covers 3.7 million acres, an area 
about the size of Massachusetts. To control damage from tourism, authorities 
have set a limit of 500 visitors to the park a year, but at least 1,500 have 
been in so far this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Low-budget travelers, who bribe rangers to get in without paying park fees, 
trek through the park without authorized guides, camping on beaches along the 
river, spooking river otters and trampling turtle egg nests. Unauthorized 
guides shoot monkeys and other animals. No one keeps track of homesteaders, who 
are allowed to settle in park areas designated as "buffer zones." 
</P>
<P>
 Peru's Machu Picchu Historical Sanctuary, a high Andean park that includes the 
ruins of the famous "Lost City of the Incas," is under even greater pressure. 
The park is inhabited by more than 2,000 people, most of them in a town that 
has grown rapidly as merchants and vendors have moved in to make a living from 
the tourist trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Cattle, sheep and goats graze the park, devouring the native vegetation. 
Slash-and-burn farming scars the land, unleashing erosion and sometimes 
sparking forest fires. Residents also hunt native fauna such as the Andean 
condor, deer and puma. Rare orchids in the sanctuary are being depleted as 
poachers sell them to tourists or spirit them out of the country for the 
international orchid trade. Thousands of tourists trek through the park each 
year, especially along the old Inca Trail.

THE WEEK AHEAD: HELSINKI; SHIPBOARD MEMORIAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A shipboard memorial service will be held Saturday off the Finnish island of 
Uto for the at least 885 people who died when the luxury ferry Estonia sank in 
the Baltic Sea in September. The Estonia capsized when its 56-ton bow door 
ripped off in a storm, allowing water to enter the ferry's huge car deck and 
destabilize the ship. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatives of the Estonia victims -- most of whom were Swedish -- have been 
calling for the entire wreck to be raised from the seabed off southern Finland. 
Hundreds of victims' bodies are entombed within the wreck, and the relatives 
want to give them burials on land. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the Finnish government has ordered the bow doors of similar ships 
cruising the Baltic welded shut, at least until the Estonia case is closed.

REGIONAL OUTLOOK; A NEW CONTINENTAL DIVIDE?; FORGET THE COMPASS. EUROPE IS NO 
LONGER EAST AND WEST. BUT WHAT IS IT? IN A SEARCH FOR THE ANSWER, THE STATE 
DEPARTMENT IS HEADING FOR MIDDLE GROUND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN E. MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On a continent where countries have such odd names as the Former Yugoslav 
Republic of Macedonia and some cities have undergone three name changes this 
century, it should come as no surprise that Europeans take geopolitical 
designations very seriously. 
</P>
<P>
 So it was with considerable appreciation that officials of the formerly 
Communist nations of Europe received a decision by the U.S. State Department to 
do away with the unpopular term "Eastern Europe" in describing the onetime 
satellite states of the former Soviet Union. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy shift has drawn little notice in Washington, where it was first 
mentioned publicly by Assistant Secretary of State Richard Holbrooke in 
testimony to Congress in late September. But to those attuned to the historical 
and cultural sensitivities in this region, the pronouncement is seen as 
long-overdue confirmation that Europe cannot be defined merely by the compass 
points East and West. 
</P>
<P>
 The middle is back, and it goes by the name Central Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "The change helps make each country here visible as an individual entity 
rather than a sub-part of one big, gray mass," said Pavel Bratinka, Czech 
deputy foreign minister. "It is a clear sign that even beyond the Atlantic 
Ocean they are starting to differentiate among us." 
</P>
<P>
 It did not, of course, require a State Department decree to resurrect Central 
Europe in the minds of Czechs and other self-described Central Europeans, many 
of whom have been speaking rather directly about their distaste for the 
"Eastern Europe" label. 
</P>
<P>
 The notion of returning to Central Europe first became popular a decade ago 
among intellectuals and dissidents disenchanted with Communist rule in the 
former Czechoslovakia and elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Czechs have been particularly perturbed by the "Eastern" designation, noting 
that Prague lies west of such indisputably non-Eastern capitals as Vienna and 
Stockholm. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Central Europe' has been the PC thing to say around here for quite some 
time now," said Jason Kelleher, admissions officer at the Central European 
University in Prague, a graduate school whose main campus is in Budapest, 
Hungary. 
</P>
<P>
 In part, the move toward Central Europe is cultural snobbery, an effort by 
former Soviet client states to distance themselves from countries such as 
Ukraine and Belarus that were actually part of the Soviet Union. In the pecking 
order of subjugation, many self-described Central Europeans see a huge 
difference between countries that were under Soviet dominance and those 
actually consumed by the empire. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't admit it publicly, but part of this has to do with all of us 
looking down on our eastern neighbors," a high-ranking Polish official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the rush to embrace Central Europe also has some very practical 
considerations. For countries with aspirations to join the European Union, NATO 
and other European institutions, the shift from Eastern to Central Europe is 
seen as a large step toward the West. This is particularly true for the 
so-called Visegrad countries -- Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and the Czech 
Republic -- whose representatives met in Visegrad, Hungary, two years ago to 
coordinate their bids for European integration. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some time it was Eastern Europe, and now it is Central Europe," said 
Longin Pastusiak, deputy chairman of the Polish Parliament's foreign relations 
committee. "I am looking forward to the period when it is only Europe." 
</P>
<P>
 Countries such as the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Hungary, Poland and Romania 
trace their Central European credentials to the Austro-Hungarian Empire, the 
great European power, seated in Vienna, that emerged in the 16th Century. Even 
after its dissolution at the end of World War I, its former subjects never gave 
up on the empire's notion of being at the core of the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
 But history intervened near the end of World War II, and then there was a hole 
in the center of the European doughnut for almost four decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The disappearance of Central Europe is most commonly blamed on the Yalta 
Conference in February, 1945, the last wartime meeting of Soviet leader Joseph 
Stalin, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. 
Roosevelt, during which the postwar settlement dividing Europe into spheres of 
influence was worked out. Afterward, convenient political delineations -- 
namely, East and West -- took precedence over strictly geographic and historic 
ones in charting a new map of Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms "East" and "West" were soon applied to the occupied zones of 
vanquished Germany as well, designations that were easier understood than the 
Federal Republic of Germany (West) and the German Democratic Republic (East). 
</P>
<P>
 With Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria and East Germany 
relegated to satellite status of the Soviet Union -- a country so eastward that 
it straddled the Ural Mountains and spilled into Asia -- it was simple for the 
world to refer collectively to the Soviet subjects as Eastern Europeans. 
</P>
<P>
 "An artificial map was imposed on Europe that divided everything into 
'Eastern' and 'Western,' " said Piotr Nowina-Konopka, a foreign affairs expert 
in the Polish Parliament. "There was a clear division of influence, and such 
countries as Poland were simply sent to the corner. Our bad luck was that we 
were sent to the eastern corner." 
</P>
<P>
 This folding of Central Europe into Eastern Europe occurred gradually as the 
Cold War grew more intense and the rhetoric of the U.S.-Soviet rivalry more 
pronounced. In a famous 1946 speech, Churchill pronounced: "From Stettin in the 
Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic, an Iron Curtain has descended across the 
Continent. Behind that line lie all capitals of the ancient states of Central 
and Eastern Europe: Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, 
Bucharest and Sofia." 
</P>
<P>
 With Europe separated into two ideological camps, the Cold War lexicon soon 
grew geographically simplistic. Americans and West Europeans began referring to 
the "East-West" divide, and terms such as "Eastern bloc" became synonymous with 
Soviet-dominated Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 For propagandists, it was easy to vilify things "Eastern" and make people 
fearful of them, since the "East-West" metaphor had a long tradition apart from 
superpower politics. "East-West" also referred to centuries-old cultural 
differences between European and Asian peoples, the latter regarded as 
mysterious and backward. 
</P>
<P>
 It was along such lines in the early 1980s that the idea of Central Europe 
first re-emerged in the Soviet bloc countries. Czech writer Milan Kundera and 
others, disenchanted with Soviet-style Communist rule in Europe, began drawing 
distinctions between European and Russian culture, nudging Russia farther and 
farther east and virtually off the European map. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Czech Prime Minister Petr Pithart, a Communist-era dissident who 
lectures on law and politics, said the concept of Central Europe also focused 
less on geography than on culture and history. The idea, he said, was that 
Europeans living roughly between Germany and Russia had a special role to play 
on the Continent. 
</P>
<P>
 This idealized vision of Central Europe emphasized pluralism, 
multiculturalism, and in the post-Communist context, a civil society in which 
citizens would fill the moral and social void created by communism. At its 
core, it included Czechs, Slovaks, Poles and Hungarians but could also extend 
to Germans, Austrians and Ruthenians, part of present-day Ukraine. 
</P>
<P>
 "Central Europe is not for us merely a neutral geographic concept," Pithart 
said. "It has certain values on which doubt is cast all the time, which are 
threatened all the time. It is the most dense area of European pluralism, 
something like a dark forest where you don't want to live, but you can't be 
without." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the fall of communism, a debate that had been confined mostly to 
literary circles soon found itself on the political agenda, and with time, into 
the briefing books at the U.S. State Department. The road from theory to 
political practice has not been without its bumps, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Holbrooke has proposed reorganizing the Bureau of European and Canadian 
Affairs to reflect the new geopolitical realities of the European Continent. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, reality can be subjective. Ukraine, for example, wants to be 
known as Central Europe but none of its Central European neighbors include it 
in the club. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department is also stumped over what to call its office dealing with 
Germany, Austria and Switzerland. The Germans regard themselves as Central 
Europeans, but their notion of the region -- known as Mitteleuropa -- has been 
interpreted in the past as license to dominate neighbors. Many Europeans would 
prefer to leave Germany in Western Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 So, where is Central Europe? 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a touchy thing," said Bratinka, the Czech deputy foreign minister. "You 
will not wring out of me anything other than the assertion that the Czech 
Republic is in Central Europe." Reworking the Political Geography of Europe 
</P>
<P>
 The Continent's new politics are challenging traditional terms like "Eastern 
Europe" and "Western Europe." Here's a look at the map of Cold War Europe and 
how the U.S. State Department is now tentatively proposing to group some of the 
nations: 
</P>
<P>
 COLD WAR EUROPE 
</P>
<P>
 1. Western Europe 
</P>
<P>
 2. Eastern Europe 
</P>
<P>
 3. Soviet Union 
</P>
<P>
 CURRENT PROPOSAL 
</P>
<P>
 1. Baltic-Nordic 
</P>
<P>
 2. North-Central 
</P>
<P>
 3. Eastern 
</P>
<P>
 4. South Central 
</P>
<P>
 Note: Western Europe is being defined as France, Italy, Malta, Portugal and 
Spain. Germany, Austria and Switzerland are grouped together; whether they 
belong in Central Europe is being debated.

CARTOONISTS TRAVEL THE ROAD TO INDONESIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Nothing binds -- or divides -- the nations of the Pacific Rim more than the 
issue of trade, and President Clinton's trip last week to the Asia-Pacific 
Economic Cooperation summit in Indonesia, stirred the pot once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Leaders of 18 nations set a far-distant target date -- the year 2020 -- to 
dismantle all trade barriers along the Pacific shores, and even that agreement 
proved a struggle. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the President declared the policy goal "good news," and trade 
experts commented that any agreement among such a diverse group of countries 
was an achievement. 
</P>
<P>
 Editorial cartoonists, as usual, got in the parting shots, suggesting that the 
American President was dealing from a difficult position when it came to 
getting the booming Asian economies into harness on common goals.

PROFILE; MONDALE DIVES INTO TOKYO'S DIPLOMATIC WATERS; THE AMBASSADOR FINDS 
JAPAN 'DYNAMIC, CHALLENGING' AFTER 1 1/2 YEARS ON THE JOB. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the mayor of Nagasaki at their side, Walter and Joan Mondale placed a 
wreath on a stand and looked up to a massive statue in Peace Park, dedicated to 
victims of the atomic bomb the United States dropped here nearly half a century 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 TV cameras scrutinized their faces, and America's ambassador to Japan and his 
wife knew they should appear solemn. A bright sun shining in their eyes helped. 
But so did the enormity of the event for which they were symbolically 
expressing condolences. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 74,000 Nagasaki residents, Mayor Hitoshi Motoshima said, died in the 
first four months after the bomb destroyed the city in August, 1945, three days 
after an atomic bomb leveled Hiroshima. Later, Japanese media reported that 
Mondale said he was shocked by displays at a museum showing the bomb's effects. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Mondales were on their way to see a Peace Park sculpture by an 
artist from Minnesota, the ambassador's native state, visiting students 
recognized the former vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondale extended his hand, and the students, squealing with excitement, mobbed 
him. Soon, others had their cameras out, snapping shots of Mondale with his 
arms around students. It was a love fest. Such are the emotional roller 
coasters of the ambassador to Japan, who insists that he still enjoys his job. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question that the man who lost a bid for the presidency in 1984 
has plunged into his job with the dedication of an honor student -- reading 
history, probing how Japan ticks, quizzing Japanese leaders on their ideas for 
Japan's future and going through 12-hour forays into the countryside. "I'm 
learning a lot I wouldn't learn if I did just another political job," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Washington's supervision, he is the commander of one of America's 
largest diplomatic outposts, a 600-member embassy that manages work involving 
47,000 American troops at bases in Japan, cultural, political, scientific and 
technological dealings and attempts to reduce America's $60-billion bilateral 
trade deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most dynamic, challenging area in the world -- far more so than I 
think is recognized in the United States," Mondale said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 "Deep down emotionally, viscerally," Euro-centered Americans still have not 
grasped the importance of Asia transforming itself into an economic powerhouse 
-- a development "that's changing the world in the profoundest possible way," 
he pointed out. 
</P>
<P>
 Americans must have this new fact of life "cranked into our thinking and our 
psyche" so they can make correct business, political and security judgments, 
and even "cultural decisions on where we send our kids -- what we teach our 
kids." 
</P>
<P>
 "If I can build our interests here, if I can make Americans more aware of our 
stake here, I can have some influence on long-term policy," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondale indicated that when Washington officials started lambasting Japanese 
bureaucrats for "sabotaging" still uncompleted negotiations to establish what 
Washington calls a "framework" for U.S.-Japan economic relations, he stepped in 
to tone down the rhetoric. "You haven't seen much of that recently, have you?" 
he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese bureaucrats, he added, "are very gifted people with a lot of 
experience. When you get them on your side, they're good allies." 
</P>
<P>
 In dealing with the Japanese, Mondale said his service as President Jimmy 
Carter's vice president enabled him "in ways that might be more difficult for 
others . . . to speak for the (United States)." Japanese, he added, "receive me 
in a very respectful way." 
</P>
<P>
 In the difficult area of trade, the ambassador rattled off a list of 
agreements that have been reached during his 1 1/2 years in Japan -- in 
construction, rice, cellular telephones, intellectual property, 
telecommunications, medical equipment and insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, Mondale noted, no progress at all has been achieved on such key issues as 
opening doors to investment in Japan. Because of interlocking ownership, as 
much as 70% of the stock in Japanese corporations is never traded, "making it 
almost impossible to come in and buy a company here." 
</P>
<P>
 "This economy, historically, was very insular . . . and (is) still insular," 
he said. Compared to about $700 billion worth of foreign direct investment in 
Europe and $500 billion in the United States, Japan has taken in $12 billion, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Trade follows investment. The fact that we can't penetrate this market in 
terms of our own investment affects our ability to trade here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For their own long-term health, they need to open this economy up more. . . . 
Wherever Japan competes with the world, she's usually the best or nearly the 
best -- cars, consumer electronics, that sort of thing. But where she protects 
herself -- construction, housing, financial services, retailing -- she's not 
impressive. And there's a big chunk of this economy that's protected and 
inefficient." 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, "Both countries say we (won't let) our (economic) disputes 
spill over into . . . our security relationship. But I don't like to test that 
theory too much, and I keep telling my Japanese friends, 'Let's try to get 
these issues resolved,' " Mondale said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mondale said political reforms here "will help improve bilateral relations." 
Already, Japan's political parties have moved toward the center, firming up 
support both for the U.S.-Japan alliance and a greater Japanese contribution 
abroad, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Redistricting also "should significantly strengthen the voice of urban 
consumers, who most favor deregulation and a more open market," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 A new dimension entered U.S.-Japan relations with the agreement between 
Washington and Pyongyang designed to wipe out suspicions of North Korea's 
nuclear weapons development -- an agreement Mondale said would have been 
impossible without Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S.-Japan Security Treaty and the bases that Japan permits U.S. troops to 
operate here "denied North Korea a military option . . . (and) made it clear 
that there was no option available to them other than to negotiate," he said. 
Without the bases here, the United States could not defend South Korea, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 With Japan paying $4.5 billion to support the U.S. bases, "I think the 
U.S.-Japan mutual security treaty is the best bargain we have in the world. It 
buys us a better opportunity for stability. It buys us a chance to avoid war," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Japan has promised to make a "significant contribution" -- second 
only to South Korea's -- to paying the $4-billion cost of providing new 
light-water nuclear power reactors to reduce the North's ability to extract 
plutonium from spent nuclear fuel, he said. The United States won't be paying 
anything, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 A new headache for U.S.-Japan relations is likely to come next year, the 50th 
anniversary of Japan's defeat in World War II, Mondale said. Noting the uproar 
already created in both Japan and the United States by a planned Smithsonian 
Institution exhibit on the nuclear bomb dropped on Hiroshima, he said: 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are 50 years away from (the end of the war), and we still have these 
very deep differences of opinion about what actually happened." 
</P>
<P>
 Although two recent prime ministers "made forthcoming statements" facing up to 
Japan's wartime aggression, "a lot of Japanese leaders take a different 
position," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there's any way of settling the debate. . . . I'm hopeful that 
the 50th anniversary will involve at least two things: one, candid recognition 
of what happened, followed by a desire by everyone to get on with this world 
and dealing with our problems. . . . After 50 years, we ought to say that's 
enough." Biography

<P>
 For nearly three centuries, the region that today is marked on the political 
map as the German state of Brandenburg has stood in constant readiness for war. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 18th Century, these pine-covered flatlands were the parade ground of 
Prussian military might; during the Nazi rearmament of the 1930s, they became 
the command and control center for Hitler's Wehrmacht. During the Cold War, 
when 350,000 Soviet troops, advisers and their dependents occupied East 
Germany, a full 200,000 of them were stationed in present-day Brandenburg, 
setting up the state as a sure-fire nuclear ground zero if war broke out 
between the superpowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the last Russian garrison troops are gone from eastern Germany, and 
Brandenburg has set about the immense task of undoing its war economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's really a break with the past," says Roland Vogt, the Brandenburg 
official in charge of defense conversion. He calls the state's vast, newly 
vacated military real estate "a sea of sadness" -- an expanse of decrepit 
barracks, ammunition-strewn training fields, tumbledown Soviet officers' 
quarters, and empty tank ranges, all surrounded by tall barbed-wire-topped 
fences marked "mortal danger."  
</P>
<P>
 Vogt's job, as he puts it, is "to create some islands" in this sea. 
</P>
<P>
 One such island-in-the-making is Pinnow, population 900, a farming village 
near the German-Polish border. It was here, during the Cold War, that 1,600 
specialists built the Konkurs, an advanced anti-tank missile, and maintained 
the radar guidance systems used in various other Warsaw Pact missiles and 
rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, thanks to western German investment and the prodding of socially 
conscious bureaucrats, Pinnow's rocket workers are engaged in the useful task 
of dismantling all those same rockets, extracting the propellant and safely 
burning it off in a 2,200-degree incinerator. Pinnow's transformation from 
warmonger to peacemaker isn't complete yet, but when it is, the village may 
prove one of Brandenburg's defense-conversion success stories. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing a job which is really necessary," says Joern Broemmelhoerster, 
an economist with the Bonn International Center for Conversion. "We never had 
the facilities to destroy these weapons before." 
</P>
<P>
 What happened to Pinnow's elite rocket works is much like what happened to, 
say, Southern California's Lockheed Corp. or Hughes Aircraft Co., only more so. 
When the Cold War ended, not only did the factory's orders dry up, but the 
government that had nurtured the plant vanished. 
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, East Germany's central planners had sited the rocket 
works smack in the middle of nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pinnow is in one of the poorest regions in Germany," Broemmelhoerster notes. 
"Without the factory, there is nothing to do there except farm. When the Cold 
War ended, there were all of these highly trained people there, and nothing for 
them to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, far to the south, near Germany's border with Austria, a private 
company called Buck Inpar was having difficulties of its own with the end of 
the Cold War. Buck, a pyrotechnics concern, had busied itself throughout the 
Iron Curtain years making smoke grenades, flares and other battlefield 
incendiary devices. Now it too suddenly found its engineers standing around 
with their hands in their pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buck was looking for opportunities," manager Werner Scherer says. "The only 
opportunity we could see was in the weapons-disposal business." 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance, Pinnow seemed a perfect acquisition target for Buck, for the 
treaty governing the Red Army pullout from Germany called for the 
government-financed dismantling of 300,000-odd tons of East German munitions. 
Pinnow had the site and the people to do the job; Buck had the private capital 
and know-how to refit the rocket plant, and the government, of course, would 
provide the raw materials -- the rockets. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the end, it wasn't quite so simple. While Germany has nothing compared 
to President Clinton's Technology Reinvestment Program -- the plan for 
shepherding America's defense contractors into peaceful manufacturing markets 
-- it does have a powerful federal agency charged with privatizing East 
Germany's old industrial stock. This organization, the Treuhandanstalt, tries 
to see to it that the investors preserve as many jobs and components of the 
eastern industrial stock as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 And the Treuhandanstalt was not willing to let Buck take over the Pinnow 
rocket works unless it would put the whole, sprawling factory grounds to use, 
to guarantee at least 750 jobs through the end of 1995, and to invest at least 
50 million marks, or about $35 million. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, Buck decided that rocket-dismantling in Pinnow looked like a good 
enough business proposition to justify taking on a number of experimental, 
non-pyrotechnic sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 So today, in addition to dismantling the rockets, Buck is churning out 
prefabricated buildings, storm windows and hospital beds, as well as developing 
clean-up systems for polluted soil and water, and operating a nascent 
hazardous-waste transport concern. It has also become a partner in a 
hairdressing school. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, Buck employs not just the 750 villagers that it promised, but 1,400. 
The same technicians who used to put together rockets and radar systems have 
been retrained to build molds, pour concrete and operate state-of-the-art 
computer design equipment. And the weapons-dismantling division, having just 
finished its share of the Warsaw Pact rockets, now receives orders from NATO to 
incinerate small-caliber ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 The only problem in sight is that the profitable segments of the factory are 
still connected, in one way or another, to the military -- the weapons 
dismantling project and the house-construction business. Buck's prefabricated 
houses have a ready-made market at the German Defense Ministry because Germany 
is obliged by treaty to provide housing for the returning Russian troops and 
officers who until last August occupied eastern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 Can such a state of affairs be considered an authentic "defense conversion?"  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, over time, says Vogt, the Brandenburg defense-conversion official. He 
argues that, far from perpetuating dependency on bureaucratic largess, Pinnow's 
current diet of military contracts will simply tide it through to the day when 
it can find markets for its other products. More on Transition

POSTSCRIPT; DISILLUSIONED SYRIAN JEWS ARE TRICKLING BACK HOME; HUNDREDS FLED 
WHEN THEY COULD. BUT LIFE IN BROOKLYN AND FRANCE HAS PROVEN TOO DIFFICULT FOR 
SOME EMIGRES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 When Khodor Kabariti left them a few months ago, the vine-covered alleys, 
redolent of stewing onions and sharp saffron, seemed like passages to the past. 
But the Jewish quarter in this ancient city was dying. It was time to end 2,700 
years of Jewish history here in the heart of the Arab world and move on to new 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Syrian President Hafez Assad agreed last year to issue exit visas for 
the country's dwindling population of native Jews, nearly everyone who could 
afford them bought tickets and boarded planes -- Kabariti among them. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, I wanted to find out what kind of life I could live somewhere else," 
said the 29-year-old teacher at the Jewish school in the heart of old Damascus. 
</P>
<P>
 Kosher meat shops and fine-tailored clothing stores were put up for sale. 
Gracious old houses -- the classic Damascene townhouses hidden in the city's 
ancient alleys, their intricate tile courtyards draped with shade trees and 
hanging vines -- were passed on to the few friends or family members who stayed 
behind, or sold to Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last 18 months, a population of perhaps 3,800 Syrian Jews has shrunk 
to just 300 in Damascus and 100 or so in the northeastern town of Kamishli. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, over the last few weeks, the sound of sad farewells has given way to 
the noise of welcoming celebrations. The shutters are opening on closed-up 
Jewish houses. Slowly but surely, many of those who left are finding that life 
in Brooklyn and France was not what they had hoped for, and they are coming 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last month, the first two returning families arrived on a flight from New 
York. A third arrived the following week, and a week after that, two more 
families. 
</P>
<P>
 Yousef Jajati, head of the Syrian Jewish community, expects that many more 
will be returning over the next several months, reflecting a growing 
disillusionment with life abroad and reaffirming ties to a nation that has been 
their homeland for more than two millennia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anybody who is coming back, we are taking care of him, helping him to 
establish his new life here," said Jajati, a well-to-do merchant who has no 
intention of giving up his clothing and import-export business and leaving 
Damascus but who hopes to open a second office in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, the Syrian Jewish community has become something of a cause 
celebre, the most visible victims of Syria's confrontation with Israel and the 
subject of countless demands for freedom posed by American, European, Israeli 
and international Jewish organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Syrian government began easing restrictions on the Jews several years ago, 
removing the requirement that their identity cards carry the word "Musawi," or 
"follower of Moses"; permitting them to travel outside Damascus; opening up 
international trade opportunities for Jewish businessmen and freeing two 
brothers imprisoned on charges of trying to emigrate to Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Exit visas were issued only sporadically, though, and often not granted to 
entire families, requiring those who left to leave relatives behind. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, after last year's summit meeting between Assad and President Clinton in 
Geneva, the Syrian government announced that it would grant an exit visa to any 
Jew who wanted one. Some restrictions still applied. For instance, Jews could 
only take a maximum of $2,500 with them when they left the country. Still, 
leave they did -- by the thousands. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year, all but a few kosher groceries shut down. Saturday Shabbat 
services sometimes didn't have enough worshipers for prayers. "I will frankly 
tell you, they left. And after their departure, the whole market here was 
affected. Those products they used to produce were not to be found -- they left 
a real shock on the neighborhood here," Jajati said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, even Chief Rabbi Avraham Hamra -- who had vowed to remain with his 
flock until the end -- made a celebrated emigration to Israel, to the vast 
annoyance of Syrian officials and not a few of the friends he left behind. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,200 Syrian Jews had already secretly flocked to Israel before 
Hamra's much-trumpeted arrival there on Oct. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message this proud leader brings with him is for the remainder of his 
community in New York to follow him," acting Jewish Agency Chairman Yehiel 
Leket said. 
</P>
<P>
 The large majority of Jews leaving Syria have settled in Brooklyn, where a 
Syrian Jewish community, now numbering 30,000, has flourished since the early 
part of the century, when Jews first fled Syria under the Turkish occupation. 
Others have settled in France, joining substantial communities of Jews from 
North African countries such as Morocco. 
</P>
<P>
 But Jajati said many of the emigres have become disillusioned after several 
months abroad. Jobs have been hard to find, and social practices in both the 
United States and France are often alien to Syrians raised under the relatively 
conservative standards of Damascus -- albeit one of the most free-wheeling of 
Arab cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem facing most of the families who have decided to return is 
economic, Jajati said. Many sold their shops and homes at a fraction of what 
they were worth, then found it tremendously more expensive to buy or rent new 
housing and commercial space in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in this country have security, praise Allah," Jajati said, adopting a 
common Muslim expression. "Work is available for everybody, and here if you get 
a little money, you can manage to live on it. I have Syrian friends from our 
community who went to New York, but they couldn't get jobs and work. . . . They 
had in mind that they were going to gain much more money, and instead, many of 
them have lost everything. 
</P>
<P>
 "You must remember," Jajati said, "our people, our community, used to have the 
best cars, the best shops, right in the center of Damascus. One man had a shop 
worth 20 million Syrian pounds (about $450,000). He sold it for 6 million 
(about $133,000). You must realize his position." 
</P>
<P>
 Kabariti sold all his furniture but kept his house when he left with his wife, 
3-year-old daughter, his parents and his sister and her family four months ago 
for France. Two weeks ago, he was back in Damascus, having decided the world 
outside was not all he had expected it to be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found the social life so different, so difficult to live in," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother, Eva, 50, interrupted. "The nature of life there is so different. 
We could have only one room for the whole of the family. And this style of 
Oriental life which we are accustomed to, it means you are in good relation 
with your neighbors, visiting them, they visit you. This is what we are raised 
on. There, we felt like strangers." 
</P>
<P>
 The emigrant Jewish community in the town where they lived numbered less than 
100. They helped them financially the first two months, but then there was no 
more help, and the family decided to come home. 
</P>
<P>
 Kabariti was greeted by the remaining community, which pledged to help him buy 
new furniture for his home. He was offered his old job as schoolteacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "The lesson we have learned is that life at home is always easier than 
elsewhere," his mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 A butcher who returned the same week is being promised a job in one of the 
remaining meat shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Jajati said the community will do whatever is possible to make sure returnees 
don't regret their homecoming. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure now of my words, and I have been assured also by the Syrian 
officials," he said. "Everyone who would like to come back to resume his life, 
he will be warmly welcomed."

MEDIA; MITTERRAND 'EXPOSE' IRRITATES THE FRENCH; 'FRANCE HAS PASSED FROM GOOD 
OLD CATHOLIC INDULGENCE TO ANGLO-SAXON PURITANISM,' COMPLAINS ONE EDITOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT KRAFT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For two decades, French journalists and the nation's high and mighty kept this 
scandalous secret: President Francois Mitterrand, a married man, had a mistress 
and an illegitimate daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 So when Paris Match published that fact earlier this month, along with a 
photograph of Mitterrand and his 20-year-old daughter, the outcry was, 
understandably, deafening. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't the affair that turned out to be the scandal. No one criticized 
that. And few even seemed to care that Mitterrand might have used taxpayer 
money to support his "second family." 
</P>
<P>
 What agitated many of France's leading journalists and political figures was 
that Paris Match had printed the expose at all. In their view, the magazine had 
violated the heretofore sanctified realm of a politician's private life, 
breaking an unwritten journalistic code. Their biggest fear was that the French 
press was becoming too much like the American and English press. 
</P>
<P>
 "For years, France has remained an island of wisdom in an ocean of revelations 
that pollute the newspapers of America, Britain, Italy and Germany," wrote 
Franz-Olivier Giesbert, editor of Le Figaro, Paris' largest-circulation daily 
newspaper. "In the space of a few hours, France has passed from good old 
Catholic indulgence to Anglo-Saxon puritanism." 
</P>
<P>
 Lost in the debate was the story itself, the details of which were enough to 
make Fleet Street drool. In the mid-1960s, when he was 50 years old, Mitterrand 
began a long affair with Anne Pingeot, a 30-year-old campaign volunteer. In 
1974, she gave birth to their daughter, Mazarine. 
</P>
<P>
 Mazarine is the third child of Mitterrand, 78, who also has two grown sons by 
Danielle Mitterrand, his wife of the last 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The public revelation came in the final months of Mitterrand's 14-year 
presidency and, perhaps, his life. He has prostate cancer and has himself 
raised the possibility that he may not survive until May, when his term 
expires. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paris Match photos and articles, which boosted circulation of that popular 
weekly from 800,000 to 1.2 million, uncorked a host of troubling questions for 
editors faced with dwindling readership, journalists protecting other secrets 
and politicians worried about their private lives. 
</P>
<P>
 By keeping Mitterrand's daughter out of the papers, had journalists 
contributed to the aura of monarchy that surrounds his presidency? Did 
Mitterrand himself, by taking his daughter to public restaurants and inviting 
her to state dinners, not open the door? And if taxpayer money was used to 
support Mitterrand's mistress and offspring, should not the citizenry have been 
told sooner? 
</P>
<P>
 But the overriding question was: Where is the line between a politician's 
public and private lives? 
</P>
<P>
 The debate has put the French press, as well as some basic tenets of French 
life, under the microscope. It also mirrors the American debate over what the 
public has a right to know -- and, in this case, whether breaking one's 
marriage vows consistently over a period of decades casts doubt on a 
politician's character or his or her fitness for public office. 
</P>
<P>
 In the United States, the sexual misconduct of public figures "has more to do 
with the fact of lying," said Christine Ockrent, one of France's most respected 
journalists and editor of the weekly newsmagazine L'Express. "But in France 
there is a certain politeness, where things relating to sex are not discussed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We never talk about sex, you know, we talk about love," she added. "It's 
cultural. And I feel in our part of the world it is important to maintain the 
dividing line between what people do in bed and what they do in government." 
</P>
<P>
 The Paris Match article stemmed from "Plaidoyer Impossible" (Impossible 
Defense), a book by Philippe Alexandre, a French journalist and political 
analyst. The existence of Mitterrand's daughter had been revealed before, but 
only in books and articles written by right-wing critics of the Socialist 
president. It had never been exposed in a mainstream publication. 
</P>
<P>
 Defending their decision to publish, Paris Match and Alexandre argued that 
Mitterrand had effectively revealed his daughter's existence himself by 
appearing in public with her. And Alexandre said the likelihood that Mazarine 
and her mother were supported by the state makes it a public matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The French aren't very curious about love affairs," Alexandre said in an 
interview. "If I learn that a public figure has a mistress and spends the 
weekend with her, that doesn't interest the French. They think that is nearly 
normal. 
</P>
<P>
 "But money does interest us," he added. "And that is my justification -- not 
that Francois Mitterrand had a liaison that lasted 30 years, but that he used 
public money for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Serge July, editor of the left-leaning Liberation newspaper, said "everyone 
knew" about Mitterrand and his daughter. July himself had run into the pair 
twice at restaurants. But he never published it because the relationship had 
not influenced public policy, and Mitterrand had never made his own morality a 
political issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only other question for me was: Is this second family supported by 
government money?" July said. "And that remains to be investigated." 
</P>
<P>
 Giesbert, whose newspaper, Le Figaro, has opposed Mitterrand, called Alexandre 
"a very courageous journalist." But, he added, "I just don't agree with him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I don't think it's OK to use public money to support a mistress," 
Giesbert said in an interview. "But it's not the scandal of the year. I don't 
think it is. I'm sorry. I don't think it's a story." 
</P>
<P>
 Like many editors in France, Giesbert believes that the public's right to know 
stops at the doors of a politician's home. 
</P>
<P>
 In the debate here, even Alexandre's critics acknowledge that many journalists 
in France are timid, and especially too reverential and too respectful of 
political power. And the most powerful man in politics for nearly 14 years has 
been Mitterrand. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, journalists knew that Mitterrand had mistresses and that he and his 
wife, Danielle, led largely separate lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Danielle Mitterrand is said to have first met her husband's mistress last year 
in the hospital, when the president was recovering from a cancer operation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1960s and 1970s, journalists say, Mitterrand often brought Pingeot to 
Socialist Party meetings. And Pingeot and her daughter reportedly lived in a 
state-owned apartment, under police guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitterrand has never denied Mazarine's existence. In 1984, four years into his 
first term as president, a group of top political reporters asked Mitterrand if 
he had a "natural daughter." He responded: "Yes. So what?" And no one wrote a 
word about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Paris Match contends that Mitterrand knew of its intention to publish and did 
not object. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fuzzy long-lens photograph published in Paris Match, Mitterrand is 
resting his arm protectively on the dark-haired young woman's shoulders as they 
emerge from a Paris restaurant.

GETTING INVOLVED: MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR COMMUNITY; HELPING KIDS GOAL OF 2 
MEN AT NEW CHARITY

 The apparent assets of the Child Support Recovery Foundation are a simple 
office in Burbank, a phone, a fax machine and two men who want to help kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're everything from janitors to executives," said Charles Semple, 
development director for the two-man organization.  
</P>
<P>
 He met the other half of the foundation, administrator Dennis Kennedy, by 
chance in North Hollywood last year. 
</P>
<P>
 While waiting for separate meetings, they struck up a conversation, and 
Kennedy outlined his ideas for a group that would help a single parent with 
custody of children collect child support from the absentee parent. 
</P>
<P>
 Semple, retired from industrial marketing, joined Kennedy, and together they 
worked through the maze of paperwork to set up a charity. They received federal 
and state status this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an acceptable fact now to not pay child support," said Kennedy, a bill 
collector for 25 years who now works as a consultant. He wanted to start the 
charity because of the many single mothers he had run across who were unable to 
pay bills because they were not getting their child support payments. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess I'm just a sucker for people who need help," said Kennedy, who has 
put $20,000 of his own money into the venture. Although easily mistaken as a 
bill collection agency, what Kennedy and Semple offer is advice for parents on 
how they can recover unpaid child support. 
</P>
<P>
 Most may rely merely on filing a claim with the District Attorney's Office, 
but that can take years to get results, Kennedy said. That is not the only way, 
he said. Parents can also hire their own attorney, but that can be expensive, 
and many do not know how to go about getting the right attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people really don't know what is happening around them," Semple 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kennedy said he can help parents find lawyers willing to work pro bono or at 
reduced rates. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he also has come across the powerful emotions that child support can 
bring up by way of the information superhighway. When he placed a posting on 
the Prodigy computer on-line service, he was immediately blasted as a 
"do-gooder," just out to get money for ex-wives. Several women on the service 
came to his defense, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the issue is really about helping children, he said. "I see a need out 
there," said Kennedy, who also recognizes that not all custodial parents are 
women. "Our objective is helping kids." The foundation also needs volunteers to 
help with fund raising and to work in the office answering phones and 
interviewing potential clients. The foundation is holding its first fund-raiser 
Dec. 2 in Universal City. For more information, call the foundation at (818) 
841-2905. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 The 4-H After School Activity Program needs volunteers for a new program 
starting Dec. 1 at Pacoima Elementary School. The program helps children age 7 
to 13 who live in or near public housing communities by building 
self-confidence with nutritional education, arts and crafts, help with homework 
or science experiments, creative writing, book-binding, as well as recreation 
and such fund-raising activities as car washes to pay for trips to zoos or 
amusement parks. The group meets Mondays through Fridays from 2 to 6 p.m. For 
more information, call Katherine Crow at (213) 744-5138 or (213) 744-5139.

 Goodwill Industries of Southern California is seeking male and female 
volunteers ages 18 to 70 to model authentic antique fashions that date back as 
far as the 1860s. The style shows are held at major hotels, country clubs and 
churches to benefit the non-profit agency, which provides rehabilitation and 
job training and placement for people with physical and mental disabilities. 
Shows are held on weekdays as well as weekends. For information call Beryl 
Panza or Cathy Hoyt at (213) 223-1211, Ext. 229 or 230.

WASHINGTON CLEAR TO RETURN FOR USC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG SANDOVAL and EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC tailback Delon Washington was allowed to rejoin the football team Monday 
after he was cleared of charges of academic fraud. However, Kenny Cooper, who 
also was accused of having someone else take the American College Testing exam 
for him, failed to score high enough to gain reinstatement in a third ACT test 
and probably will lose a year of eligibility, sources told The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Both freshman players came under investigation after the second game of the 
season when officials from ACT headquarters challenged their scores because of 
marked improvements from a previous test. USC officials removed them from 
competition at that time. The players retook the test two weeks ago and the 
results were used to determine their standing. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington said Monday evening that USC assistant athletic director Fred 
Stroock and his staff helped him prepare to retake the test.  
</P>
<P>
 "I knew I could pass it again," Washington said. "But I got a lot of help from 
Fred and I worked almost every day except Saturday getting ready for it. I also 
had to take care of my regular course work." 
</P>
<P>
 Washington also said he believes the investigation was handled improperly by 
ACT officials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like I was treated like a criminal," Washington said. "The whole thing 
was just a waste. I lost the entire season. I was under a lot of stress during 
the preparation. 
</P>
<P>
 "They never told me what the consequences would be if I failed the test." 
</P>
<P>
 USC has never admitted to the investigation, citing the Buckley Amendment, 
which affords students privacy about their academic standing. Monday's 
announcement of Washington's reinstatement came in a terse statement from a USC 
spokesperson: "Issues surrounding the eligibility of Delon Washington have been 
resolved. He is no longer being withheld from competition. The Ken Cooper 
situation is unchanged." 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely Washington would be ready to play until a bowl game. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources said USC has asked about getting a redshirt year for Washington and 
been given an unofficial "no" because the school voluntarily held him out of 
competition. A formal petition is expected to be filed soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the ACT and Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT) are used in part to determine 
initial eligibility for NCAA Division I athletes. Academic standards -- known 
as Proposition 48 -- require freshmen to score at least 17 on the ACT or 700 on 
the SAT to be eligible. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite playing in only the first two games, Washington is fourth in rushing 
with 153 yards in 19 carries, including 109 yards against Washington in the 
opener. Cooper, a tight end, was in his redshirt season, but he probably will 
lose that year of eligibility.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 1994-95 PREVIEW; USC; PARKER WON'T BLOW HIS HORN OVER TEAM 
YET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Overconfidence is a problem the USC basketball team probably will not have to 
worry about this season. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because the Trojans have a long way to go before they can start taking 
any opponent lightly. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in nine years, USC will not have George Raveling as coach. 
Raveling, who led the Trojans to postseason tournaments the last four seasons, 
retired last week after having spent seven weeks in the hospital because of a 
traffic accident Sept. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Taking his place will be Charlie Parker, who served as an assistant the last 
six seasons. Parker will be an interim coach with an opportunity to take over 
permanently, depending on his success this season, Athletic Director Mike 
Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker's job will not be easy because the Trojans are not expected to be a 
factor this season in the Pacific 10 Conference. In the annual Pac-10 preseason 
media poll, USC was predicted to fight it out with Washington, Oregon and 
Oregon State for last place. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the Trojans that bad? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people just voted us in that position based on circumstances," said 
Parker, who, with Jack Fertig, stood in for Raveling the first month of 
practice. "At the time they voted, the situation with Coach Raveling was still 
up in the air and we still had our problems with injuries and eligibility. But, 
potentially, we feel that we are far from a seventh-place team." 
</P>
<P>
 USC did not start on a good note, though. Besides losing Raveling, the Trojans 
also lost senior Tremayne Anchrum for the season because of an injury sustained 
in practice. Anchrum will redshirt this season, but his absence will hurt USC 
because he was regarded among the conference's top returning rebounders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans also will have to play until Dec. 20 without Stais Boseman, who is 
academically ineligible. Boseman led the team in steals last season as a 
freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 "He'll have a great impact (when he returns) in areas we are weak at and that 
is defense and rebounding," Parker said, "He immediately makes us better 
because he is that type of player who makes things happen." 
</P>
<P>
 In their opener last Wednesday, the Trojans lost to New Mexico State in the 
first round of the preseason National Invitation Tournament, 97-84. USC led by 
as many as 15 points in the first half, only to run out of gas in the second. 
</P>
<P>
 "That game gave us a good idea on how much we have to go as far as 
conditioning with the style of play we want to have," Parker said. "We were not 
ready to play intense defense with a fast-break offense for a full 40 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 What also was clear was the Trojans' lack of a strong, experienced player 
inside. Kirk Homenick, a 7-foot junior, started at center but fouled out with 
no points and two rebounds in 24 minutes. His backup, David Crouse, scored 
three points and took down three rebounds in three minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 If neither Homenick nor Crouse steps forward, USC will put a small lineup on 
the court, with 6-7 senior Lorenzo Orr the tallest player. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr, an All-Pac-10 performer last season, scored a game-high 23 points and 
grabbed eight rebounds against the Aggies. He will have to have a huge season 
for the Trojans to surprise in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaha Wilson, a 6-5 sophomore, will help Orr inside and might be the sleeper on 
the team. Wilson, who had a game-high nine rebounds against New Mexico State, 
can score, rebound and run. 
</P>
<P>
 A strength for the Trojans will be in the backcourt, where starters Burt 
Harris, a 5-10 junior, and Brandon Martin, a 6-4 junior, are back. 
</P>
<P>
 Harris, a three-year starter at point guard, should prosper under Parker's 
running style and increase his scoring average. At Fairfax High, Harris 
averaged 26 points a game as a senior. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin, who scored 17 against New Mexico State, will be the Trojans' top 
outside shooting threat. Last season, he averaged 12.4 points and had a 
season-high 24 against California. 
</P>
<P>
 Freshman Cameron Murray, younger brother of former UCLA standout Tracy, will 
probably become a starter later in the season because of his ballhandling 
ability and creativity. Murray, who had 12 points and a game-high six assists 
in his debut last week, is a talented shooter who could push Harris over to 
shooting guard. 
</P>
<P>
 USC will count on sophomore Claude Green, whose specialty is the three-point 
shot, as a reserve. Green scored 12 points and had three rebounds in 17 minutes 
against the Aggies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a lot of things to work on, but three areas stand out most," Parker 
said. "We have to stop giving up too many easy baskets, get better rebounding 
and cut down on our turnovers." 
</P>
<P>
 Before USC begins Pac-10 play Jan. 5, it will play Temple, Northern Iowa, 
Utah, Sacramento State, Houston, Lamar, Missouri Kansas City and Southern 
Methodist. It's not a killer nonconference schedule, but it's tougher than in 
years past. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our goal is to do better early in conference play and not have to make a late 
run to make a postseason tournament," Parker said. "It's not going to be easy, 
and we know that we have a tremendous task ahead -- especially with the 
competition of our conference. We have an uphill battle. But, it's not anything 
that we haven't faced before." USC Facts and Figures

RAIDERS CLANKING ALONG THE ROAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Raiders are like a vintage automobile. They have been rebuilt, fine-tuned 
and pampered. 
</P>
<P>
 But once the key goes into the ignition, things happen that no mechanic seems 
able to explain. The Raiders have demonstrated a maddening tendency to break 
down on crucial drives, to sputter and stall and freeze up and threaten to die 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday was a case in point. 
</P>
<P>
 Here they were in peak form on offense -- quarterback Jeff Hostetler spreading 
the ball around to eight receivers, connecting on three touchdown passes and 
giving the ball to tailback Harvey Williams often enough to keep the defenses 
off Hostetler's back. 
</P>
<P>
 But then the sputtering began. Time and again, the Raiders stopped themselves 
with a damaging penalty. There were 11 in all, nine on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 It certainly wasn't an isolated afternoon. Over the last couple of seasons, 
the Raiders have seen more flags than an honor guard. Last season, they 
committed 148 penalties, one short of the league record. This season, with 109 
already charged and five more games to play, they seem to be on a record run. 
</P>
<P>
 The most aggravating aspect of it for Coach Art Shell, a Hall of Fame 
offensive lineman, had to be that so many of those penalties were on offense. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler was called for intentional grounding, receiver Tim Brown for illegal 
motion, fullback Tom Rathman and center Don Mosebar for holding, offensive 
tackle Gerald Perry twice for holding and once for a false start and fellow 
tackle Greg Skrepenak once for a false start and once for lining up in the 
backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's the answer? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have an answer, beyond what we've been trying to do -- talking and 
threatening," Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Shell, who has been lecturing about penalties all season, is finally backing 
up his threats, having begun fining anyone who gets a personal foul. 
</P>
<P>
 The holding calls are another matter. Perry, who returned to the lineup for 
the first time in a month Sunday after recovering from a broken ankle, says 
holding can sometimes be the lesser of two evils. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a guy is about to beat me, I'm going to grab him," Perry said. "It's just 
that simple. If he gets loose, he might break my quarterback's neck. If I grab 
him, we can line up and try it again. You figure it out." 
</P>
<P>
 OK, but with crucial games in the next two weeks against the Pittsburgh 
Steelers and the San Diego Chargers, Shell is going to have to figure something 
out if he hopes to maintain any offensive consistency. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation is as aggravating on defense. The Raiders have been shutting 
down opposing offenses. In their last seven games, they have allowed as many as 
20 points only once, and the Miami Dolphins had to go into overtime to get that 
many. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have been especially immovable against the run. Sunday, they held 
the New Orleans Saints to 16 yards rushing. The week before, the Rams got only 
22 yards rushing, including 13 by leading ball carrier Jerome Bettis. 
</P>
<P>
 So what's not to like? 
</P>
<P>
 Nothing if games lasted only 50 or 55 minutes. But despite a strong defensive 
line, a vastly improved linebacking corps and an effective, sometimes 
explosive, secondary; despite people like Terry McDaniel, Chester McGlockton, 
Anthony Smith, Jerry Ball, Nolan Harrison, Albert Lewis and Winston Moss, this 
Raider defense seems to freeze up at the most inopportune times. 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders were unable to stop the San Diego Chargers from marching for the 
winning field goal in the closing minute; were unable to stop the Dolphins from 
marching for the winning field goal in overtime and were unable to stop even 
the hapless Houston Oilers from marching in the final minute for what would 
have been a game-tying field goal, had Al Del Greco's kick not hit the crossbar 
and bounced back. 
</P>
<P>
 And again on Sunday, after playing brilliantly for 54 minutes against the 
Saints, the Raiders nearly blew a 24-7 lead, allowing two quick touchdowns with 
their prevent defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't want to give up the big play, the big strike right now," said Shell 
of Sunday's near collapse. "If they are going to drive, they are going to be 
time-consuming drives." 
</P>
<P>
 Prevent or regular defense, Moss wasn't happy with what he saw.  
</P>
<P>
 "You can't let it happen," he said. "Whatever we did good, we'll continue to 
be proud of. But what we didn't do good, we've got to go back and straighten 
out. I don't know if we're getting relaxed or what." 
</P>
<P>
 There's no chance to relax now. Not with the stretch drive ahead.

JIM MURRAY: IT COULD BE ONE-SIDED AS A DUCK HUNT

<P>
 So, now it's Penn State vs. Oregon in the Rose Bowl. Oh, swell! 
</P>
<P>
 It might be a tough ticket. Oregon hasn't been there in 37 years. Penn State 
hasn't been there in 72.  
</P>
<P>
 But if you can't get to see the Nittany Lions dine on roast Duck, don't 
despair. Here are a few things you can do to get the same effect: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Pull wings off butterflies. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Watch Gestapo home movies.  
</P>
<P>
 3. Jacklight deer in your headlights for a couple of good old boys with 
automatic rifles.  
</P>
<P>
 4. Kick a dog, tie a can to a cat.  
</P>
<P>
 5. Go see the movie "The Hindenburg" again.  
</P>
<P>
 6. Get newsreels of the bombing of Rotterdam.  
</P>
<P>
 7. Send a whole bunch of restaurant menus to the starving people in 
Bangladesh.  
</P>
<P>
 8. Read yourself to sleep with the log of the last night on the Titanic.  
</P>
<P>
 9. Get permission to watch operations at General Hospital or film autopsies at 
the county morgue.  
</P>
<P>
 10. Poison bird baths.  
</P>
<P>
 What I'm trying to say is, a matchup like this should be covered by the 
Marquis de Sade. If Penn State should play anybody whose colors are green and 
gold, it should be the Green Bay Packers. This game makes David and Goliath 
look like a "pick-'em." It's as one-sided as a flood. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider that Penn State ran up 61 points on Iowa and 63 on Ohio State and 56 
on Minnesota -- sometimes on days when Oregon was losing to Hawaii, 36-16, and 
Utah, 34-16, and you get the idea. The Nittany Lions might not have known if 
Hawaii showed up if they played them. Penn State has scored 467 points in 10 
games. That's not a team, it's an explosion.  
</P>
<P>
 Penn State has about three players who are legitimate Heisman Trophy 
candidates. The chances are, their varsity will be in the Super Bowl two years 
from now, representing somebody.  
</P>
<P>
 Maybe Oregon should tell everybody they can't make it. They got a dentist's 
appointment. For the whole team. At that, they may need one by the end of the 
game. Bring a letter from their doctor excusing them from the game. Don't show 
up for the game. Just fax it in. Take a pass.  
</P>
<P>
 You see, the trouble is, Penn State can't simply win this game; it's got to 
overwhelm it. It's got to be Little Big Horn all over again. Take no prisoners. 
</P>
<P>
 You see, it's this way: Now that they've won the Big Ten title and achieved 
one of their life's ambitions of going to the Rose Bowl, the Nittany Lions have 
to deal with their other goal -- to be national champions. To make that, they 
will have to wear out the scoreboard.  
</P>
<P>
 The trouble is, Nebraska is the national champion at the moment in all the 
polls. Now, Nebraska will be playing a very good Miami team on New Year's Night 
in the Orange Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Cornhuskers win that, Penn State cannot go anywhere by beating Oregon 
the next day, say, 21-7 or 17-10. So, Penn State and its coach, Joe Paterno, 
have to make it a wipeout. They have to make Little Big Horn look indecisive.  
</P>
<P>
 So it won't really be a game. It'll be a recital. "Chopsticks" for 22 hands. 
Oregon is merely the piano, the fiddle, the libretto. Penn State will be the 
artist, the soloist.  
</P>
<P>
 Oregon is in big trouble. So is ABC, which has to televise this execution.  
</P>
<P>
 They could blindfold Oregon, bring the Ducks a last cigarette. Or, they could 
modify the rules. 
</P>
<P>
 This is our standard cure for mismatches of this kind, but here's what they 
should do: 
</P>
<P>
 1. Give Oregon five downs, instead of four, to make a first down.  
</P>
<P>
 2. Make Penn State go 15 yards for a first down or give the Nittany Lions only 
three downs to make a 10-yard first down.  
</P>
<P>
 3. Make Penn State give the Ducks a notarized copy of the game plan, together 
with the blocking assignments, the play count and cadence and routes run. 
Failure to comply shall result in the ball going over to Oregon at the spot of 
the infraction.  
</P>
<P>
 4. Restrict Penn State's passes to designated receivers they have advised 
Oregon about. No substitutions.  
</P>
<P>
 5. Reduce the value of Penn State touchdowns to three points. Field goals by 
Penn State should be illegal. In fact, Penn State shouldn't be allowed to kick 
at all.  
</P>
<P>
 6. Fill the end zone Penn State is aiming for with alligators.  
</P>
<P>
 7. Make sure every Penn State player is a bona fide student who passed his own 
SAT, and once took a course that somebody heard of. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Overlook fumbles by Oregon and interceptions by Penn State.  
</P>
<P>
 9. Restrict Penn State to 10 men on the field, nine when the Nittany Lions are 
inside Oregon's 20.  
</P>
<P>
 10. Eliminate taunting. Anybody who says, "Where's Oregon, is it near the 
United States?" or "What's Eugene a suburb of?" gets summarily tossed out of 
the game.  
</P>
<P>
 None of that would guarantee that Oregon would win the game. But with those 
rules in effect, the Ducks should beat the spread. Which should be Penn State 
by 50.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 1994-95 PREVIEW; NATIONAL; ARKANSAS IS SIMPLY NOT IN 
JEOPARDY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Nothing against the folks at "Jeopardy," but who exactly was writing those 
clues for the recent celebrity contestants . . . Forrest Gump? The night we 
watched, host Alex Trebek was lobbing answers to a Baywatch lifeguard, some 
actor we can't remember and Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, the aspiring college coach who 
won, like, $311,000 for a Los Angeles charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Sample exchange from U.S. Presidents category: 
</P>
<P>
 Alex: This honest Abe wasn't born in Lincoln, Neb., but he did see the country 
through the Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
 Baywatch woman: Who was Abe Vigoda? 
</P>
<P>
 Actor guy: Who was Abe Gibron? 
</P>
<P>
 Abdul-Jabbar: You're kidding, right? 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with clues softer than his skyhook, Abdul-Jabbar cleaned up. Now comes 
word that the big guy still is interested in pursuing a college coaching job. 
Might even entertain an offer at USC if the interim thing with Trojan Coach 
Charlie Parker doesn't work out; or at UCLA if Jim Harrick doesn't do something 
to keep the alums happy -- like walk on water. 
</P>
<P>
 If true, Kareem needs tutoring, which is where we come in. Abdul-Jabbar might 
know his presidents, but does he know the 1994-95 basketball season? Can he 
properly explain what new and ridiculous motivational tool Arkansas Coach Nolan 
Richardson will use this year? Does he know the 10 best players in the land? 
Has he considered which is worse: A middle seat in coach, or a first-class 
seat, but with a well-rested Dick Vitale next to you? 
</P>
<P>
 Play along at home, if you like, but remember your answer must be in the form 
of a question. 
</P>
<P>
 * This team starts the season as No. 1 and will end it there, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are the Arkansas Razorbacks, the defending national champions? 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this time Richardson will have to come up with a new shtick to 
psych up his players. During last season's NCAA tournament, Richardson kept 
insisting he didn't receive proper respect from the nation's media. It would 
have been a swell argument except for one thing: It wasn't true. 
</P>
<P>
 Didn't matter. The Razorbacks were appropriately riled and played as if they 
were out to prove a point. Now they return, their championship roster almost 
entirely intact. 
</P>
<P>
 * These seven men could be selling life insurance by next summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are . . . ? 
</P>
<P>
 Ohio State's Randy Ayers -- As recently as 1992, the Buckeyes were Big Ten 
champions and seeded first in the NCAA tournament. Now they're not even the 
third-best program in the state, trailing 1) Cincinnati, 2) Ohio U., and 3) 
Xavier. Ayers got a contract reprieve this year, but key player defections, 
NCAA probation and player police-blotter stories have made him vulnerable. Ohio 
State will be lucky to finish ninth in the 11-team conference. 
</P>
<P>
 North Carolina State's Les Robinson -- Nice guy, wrong situation. A solid 
recruiting year and something close to a tournament bid might save him. 
</P>
<P>
 Memphis' Larry Finch -- Supporters are tired of hearing about Finch's 
recruiting coups and then watching the Tigers finish 13-16, as they did last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Rutgers' Bob Wenzel -- After two consecutive seventh-place finishes in the 
Atlantic 10 Conference, Wenzel doesn't have much margin for error. The Scarlet 
Knights move to the Big East next season. Will Wenzel be with them? 
</P>
<P>
 Miami's Leonard Hamilton -- The Hurricanes were 0-18 in the Big East last 
season and have yet to win a conference road game in three years. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgia's Hugh Durham -- Not even Athletic Director Vince Dooley, who just got 
a five-year contract extension, can protect Durham if the Bulldog coach has 
another average season. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's Jim Harrick -- Fair or not, Harrick can't afford another first-round 
NCAA tournament blowout. 
</P>
<P>
 * A Kelly Girl replacement record could be set at this school. 
</P>
<P>
 What is Arkansas State, new home of Wimp Sanderson, the former Alabama coach 
who was dismissed for, among other things, allegedly hitting his secretary? 
</P>
<P>
 * Six are seniors, two are juniors and two are sophomores. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are the 10 best college players, but not necessarily the 10 best pro 
prospects? 
</P>
<P>
 Our first team: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Corliss Williamson, Arkansas junior forward. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alan Henderson, Indiana senior forward. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bryant Reeves, Oklahoma State senior center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kerry Kittles, Villanova sophomore guard. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Travis Best, Georgia Tech senior guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Second team: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Joe Smith, Maryland sophomore forward/center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Michael Finley, Wisconsin senior forward. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Rasheed Wallace, North Carolina sophomore center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bob Sura, Florida State senior guard. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Randolph Childress, Wake Forest senior guard. 
</P>
<P>
 * North Carolina's Dean Smith, Indiana's Bob Knight, Duke's Mike Krzyzewski, 
Louisville's Denny Crum and Michigan's Steve Fisher have this in common with 
former UCLA coach John Wooden. 
</P>
<P>
 What are national championships? Wooden had 10. Smith, Knight, Krzyzewski, 
Crum and Fisher have 10 -- total. 
</P>
<P>
 Footnote: In 1975, the season Wooden won his 10th title, he earned $32,000. 
That doesn't even pay a coach's cellular phone bill these days. 
</P>
<P>
 * Rarer than Bruce McNall's most prized coin. 
</P>
<P>
 What is a regular-season game that means something? 
</P>
<P>
 It doesn't happen often, but here is the short list of matchups that will 
influence NCAA tournament committee selections and seedings and separate the 
contenders from pretenders (sorry, pre-January games don't count; too early in 
the season): 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jan. 19, UCLA at Arizona (ESPN). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jan. 24, Michigan at Indiana (ESPN). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jan. 29, Kentucky at Arkansas (CBS). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feb. 2, North Carolina at Duke (ESPN2). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feb. 3, Cincinnati at Memphis (ESPN2). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feb. 5, Syracuse at Kentucky (CBS). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feb. 7, North Carolina at Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feb. 12, California at Arizona (ABC). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feb. 15, Arkansas at Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feb. 19, Maryland at Cincinnati (ABC); Arizona at UCLA (ABC). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feb. 26, Duke at UCLA (ABC); Georgetown at Syracuse (CBS). 
</P>
<P>
 -- Feb. 28, Arkansas at Florida (ESPN). 
</P>
<P>
 -- March 4, Duke at North Carolina (ESPN). 
</P>
<P>
 -- March 5, Oklahoma State at Kansas (ABC); Georgetown-St. John's at Madison 
Square Garden. 
</P>
<P>
 -- March 8, Indiana at Wisconsin. 
</P>
<P>
 * St. John's guard Felipe Lopez, Georgetown guard Allen Iverson, Michigan 
forward Jerod Ward, Duke guard Trajan Langdon, Valparaiso guard Bryce Drew and 
Colgate center Adonal Foyle. 
</P>
<P>
 What six freshmen will make the biggest difference for their teams? 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez, the national high school player of the year, earned votes on assorted 
Big East preseason all-star teams . . . and he hadn't played a minute. 
</P>
<P>
 Iverson, who missed his entire senior season of high school because he was 
serving prison time for his role in a brawl-riot at a Virginia bowling alley, 
is now under John Thompson's protective umbrella. Iverson, who gives the Hoyas 
their first true offensive guard in years, should flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 Ward could make the off-season losses of Jalen Rose and Juwan Howard to the 
NBA a little easier to take. 
</P>
<P>
 Langdon, who already has worked himself into the Duke starting lineup, is 
drawing rave reviews from Blue Devil coaches for his Grant Hill-like maturity 
and style. 
</P>
<P>
 The much-heralded Drew turned down nearby Notre Dame to play for his father. 
Homer Drew, who is 56-111 in recent seasons, can't thank him enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Foyle, among the top 10 recruits in the nation last year, shocked everyone by 
signing with the Red Raiders of the Patriot League. Instead of scratching their 
heads, people ought to be patting Foyle on the back. He says he signed with 
Colgate because of the school's academic tradition, its small enrollment, its 
small-town flavor and because he trusted the coach, Jack Bruen. 
</P>
<P>
 * These are to be taken with a grain of salt the size of a charcoal briquette. 
</P>
<P>
 What are the annual preseason rumors? 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, consider them nothing more than semi-informed gossip, but. . . 
. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If Wenzel gets fired at Rutgers, Florida State's Pat Kennedy would be on 
the school's short list of replacement candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 -- St. John's Coach Brian Mahoney had better enjoy Lopez this season, because 
there is talk he might turn pro next year. The same might happen at North 
Carolina with sophomores Rasheed Wallace and Jerry Stackhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 -- If Harrick gets bounced, John Calipari would leave Amherst in a UMass 
minute. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Turns out that Tommy Massimino, Rollie's younger son and a former assistant 
coach at Villanova and Nevada Las Vegas, also is being blamed for the Runnin' 
Rebels' problems. At least one UNLV official who worked closely with the team 
says Tommy wasn't exactly the most popular guy on the staff, the team or in the 
community. Worse yet, Rollie listened to him. 
</P>
<P>
 -- DePaul was this close to signing a deal with the Atlantic 10, but then got 
cold feet when certain alums and supporters started to complain. The Blue 
Demons still might join the Atlantic 10, or they could join the yet-unnamed 
all-sports league that will included lots of their pals from the Great Midwest 
Conference: Cincinnati, Memphis, St. Louis, Marquette and Alabama Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Brooklyn point guard Stephon Marbury, the No. 1-rated high school senior in 
the nation, supposedly is leaning toward Syracuse. But because he didn't choose 
the Orangemen during the recent signing period, there is talk that he might go 
elsewhere. Also, Chicago center Kevin Garnett, another top-five high school 
senior, continues to whittle his list. Illinois apparently is the front-runner. 
</P>
<P>
 * This coach should be in the Basketball Hall of Fame, but isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is Texas El Paso Coach Don Haskins? 
</P>
<P>
 All Haskins has done in 35 years is win 645 games -- second among active 
coaches (North Carolina's Dean Smith is first) -- win a national championship 
and become one of the first Division I coaches to use an all-African American 
lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 * City council, executive director of the Black Coaches Assn., Congress, a TV 
booth. 
</P>
<P>
 What are four places where George Raveling could end up? 
</P>
<P>
 * P.J. is gone here, but not forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 What is Seton Hall, where P.J. Carlesimo ran the Pirate program at high 
intensity for 12 years? 
</P>
<P>
 Carlesimo, who left to become coach of the NBA's Portland Trail Blazers, was 
loud, demanding, combative and successful. In his place is the soft-spoken 
George Blaney, who comes to Seton Hall from Holy Cross, where he won 357 games. 
Since his arrival, the daily decibel level is down and beleaguered guard Danny 
Hurley's confidence is up. 
</P>
<P>
 Blaney is one of three new coaches in the Big East. Ralph Willard of 
Pittsburgh and Pete Gillen of Providence are the two others. 
</P>
<P>
 * You heard it here first. 
</P>
<P>
 What is, UNLV isn't half as bad as you might think and will win the Big West 
title and qualify for the NCAA tournament in new Coach Tim Grgurich's first 
season? 
</P>
<P>
 * Rollie Massimino and Darrel Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 Who are two former coaches you won't be hearing about for a very long time? 
</P>
<P>
 Massimino ruined his reputation at UNLV with his arrogance and by agreeing to 
a secret supplemental contract. Johnson had a nice two days recently. He was 
fired from Baylor on Nov. 16 and then, along with his former assistants and 
four officials at other schools, was indicted Nov. 17 on federal charges of 
mail fraud, conspiracy and wire fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 * These four teams can contact their travel agents and book passage for an 
April trip to Seattle's Kingdome. 
</P>
<P>
 What are Arkansas, Massachusetts, UCLA and Alabama? 
</P>
<P>
 The Razorbacks won't flirt with an unbeaten season, but they will court 
another national championship. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts will make it to the Final Four, thanks to the tireless Lou Roe. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California talk-show hosts will be in mourning after Harrick leads 
the Bruins to a Pac-10 title and a Final Four appearance. Afterward, he will 
announce his retirement and join the cast of "Baywatch" as Jimmy, everyone's 
friend at the beach snack shack. 
</P>
<P>
 Alabama will be there because no one expects the Crimson Tide to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 * And the winner is. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 What is Arkansas? 
</P>
<P>
 * TEAMS TO WATCH: C6 
</P>
<P>
 * PAC-10 OUTLOOK: C7

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 1994-95 PREVIEW; UCLA; MARCH SHOULD LEAD DIRECTLY TO FINAL

<P>
 It has four returning starters, three senior leaders, a player-of-the-year 
candidate and four talented freshmen, but who knows if any of that will matter 
to UCLA in March?  
</P>
<P>
 Not 20 victories, not soaring rankings -- all that really matters, as UCLA 
learned so painfully again last season, is who advances in the NCAA tournament 
-- and who doesn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Tulsa moved past UCLA into the second round, and the Bruins, for 
the second time in four years, returned home without a tournament victory and 
with calls for Coach Jim Harrick's head. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, with more talent and two irreplaceable seniors, the Tulsa loss 
looms large for Harrick, who has brought consistency, six consecutive 
20-victory seasons and a broadened recruiting base -- but no Final Four 
pennants -- to Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 With fifth-year senior Ed O'Bannon making a push for the postseason individual 
awards, Tyus Edney at point guard for one last run and a front line as talented 
and deep as UCLA has had in years, if it doesn't happen this season, then when? 
</P>
<P>
 "I do believe that we are bigger and stronger, more physical than we've ever 
been since I've been here," Harrick said. "I feel very good about our program. 
I'd like to go to the Final Four, no question, I'd like to win a national 
championship. And we're going to work hard and do everything we can. 
</P>
<P>
 "But, if you don't, then you've just got to look at the men (and) say, 'Hey, 
I've done my best.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruin players, who say they plan on echoing the 1991-92 team, which 
followed a first-round exit with a trip to the final eight, emphasize that 
Harrick's job shouldn't be in jeopardy, no matter what happens this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Said sophomore swingman Charles O'Bannon: "If we make it to the first round 
again and lose, I think he'll still have a job. But that's not on any of our 
minds. It's winning. And it's not up to Coach Harrick." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins begin the season Saturday against Cal State Northridge in 
everybody's top 10 and at No. 6 in the Associated Press poll. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season's team bolted from the gate, winning its first 14 games, then 
staggered in the turn and down the homestretch, losing six of its last 13 
regular-season games, one a devastating one-point defeat by Oregon on the final 
day of the season that cost UCLA the Pacific 10 Conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, the Bruins say, they have learned from that experience. So how do 
you prepare a team for a tournament four months away? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there is a way we can prepare, and it's by playing consistent," 
Charles O'Bannon said. "That was our problem last year. We were very consistent 
early last year, and as the season progressed, our consistency kind of 
faltered." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edney, "I think, for one, we learned if you're No. 1 or No. 2, teams come 
at us to knock us off. I think we learned we have to recover from our losses, 
can't dwell on them. We have to just keep playing, so by the time the 
tournament comes around we're ready for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Mostly, the Bruins stumbled when the opposition took away their deadly fast 
break, and forced them into a half-court offense. This year, with Shon Tarver, 
the team's best outside shooter, having graduated, the Bruins will search even 
harder for someone who can free up the middle for Ed O'Bannon by making 
long-range shots. 
</P>
<P>
 The first person to get the chance might be freshman guard Toby Bailey, who 
has been impressive in practice and has been working out with the first team. 
Guards Kevin Dempsey, Marquis Burns and Cameron Dollar also will get looks 
alongside Edney, and Harrick has altered the offense to a 1-2-2 set that gives 
Edney more room to maneuver on top. 
</P>
<P>
 The frontcourt is more settled. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with the O'Bannon brothers, senior center George Zidek also returns from 
last year's starters, who will be bolstered by three freshmen -- forward J.R. 
Henderson, who might eventually work his way into the starting five as a 
ballhandling swing man; center omm'A Givens, who will spell Zidek; and forward 
Kris Johnson, a soft-handed inside player who is the son of former UCLA star 
Marques Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins' nonconference schedule includes Kentucky on Dec. 3 at the Pond of 
Anaheim in the John Wooden Classic, a trip to Louisiana State later in the 
month, home games against North Carolina State, Notre Dame and Duke and a March 
pre-tournament trip to Louisville. 
</P>
<P>
 So, is this UCLA's best shot at the Final Four since the last time it went, in 
1980, under Larry Brown? 
</P>
<P>
 "I did think we'd get to a Final Four before now," Edney said. "Every team 
we've had was capable of doing it. But this year, especially since it's my 
senior year, Ed's and George's, we've got to do everything we can." UCLA Facts

BOTH NHL SIDES TALK, BUT PLAN IS STILL TAXING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Negotiators for the NHL, meeting with representatives of the players' union 
Monday in Boston for the third time in five days, discussed elements of what 
sources said will be their final proposal toward lifting the 53-day-old 
lockout. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal is expected to be completed today or Wednesday and presented to 
the players for a vote by the end of the week. Although sources on both sides 
were optimistic that a resolution is possible, they acknowledged owners still 
want a payroll tax and players remain adamantly opposed. 
</P>
<P>
 Union head Bob Goodenow said they bargained through the evening and were to 
meet again today. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan includes raising the age of eligibility for the entry draft to 20, 
with provisions for 18- and 19-year-olds to be considered. The draft also will 
be shortened to six or eight rounds. In addition, two-way contracts would be 
standard for entry-level players. Players have made concessions on entry-level 
salaries and on limiting salary arbitration, but owners gave them figures 
prepared last weekend to try to show they need additional salary controls. 
</P>
<P>
 The NHL is willing to reduce its payroll tax rate to a top of 60% from a top 
of 122%, but there is sentiment among owners to eliminate the tax if players 
give up salary arbitration and they can save in other areas. Players might be 
given a guaranteed portion of future expansion fees and a gate tax might be 
imposed instead of a payroll tax to raise money to subsidize small-market 
clubs. Players had proposed a gate tax, although they recently dropped it. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are still some serious issues that are unresolved, but there seems to 
be a prevailing desire by both sides to play hockey with an honorable 
compromise," said Tom Reich, a player agent who has been a go-between during 
the talks. "Neither side is going to capitulate . . . I believe hockey will 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 24 games have been canceled from each club's schedule and 60 remain. 
</P>
<P>
 League officials have declared 50 games the minimum for a meaningful schedule 
and have sketched out a 50-game schedule featuring play within each conference. 
To play that many, an agreement would have to be in place within the next two 
weeks for a mid-December start.

BOWL FATE OF USC, IRISH A COMPLICATED AFFAIR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 USC is still very much in the picture in New Orleans, according to Sugar Bowl 
President Chuck Zatarain, who attended Saturday's UCLA-USC game. 
</P>
<P>
 It's just that the picture is slightly out of focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "If USC had won out (beaten UCLA and Notre Dame), we felt like they were our 
team," Zatarain said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd still very much like to have them, but the situation's a bit more 
complicated with their loss to UCLA." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins beat USC, 31-19. 
</P>
<P>
 The winner of Saturday's Notre Dame-USC game at the Coliseum still could go to 
New Orleans to play the Southeastern Conference champion on Jan. 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Or it could go to Dallas, to play the Southwest Conference champion in the 
Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 Or El Paso for the Sun Bowl or even Tempe, Ariz., for the Fiesta. 
</P>
<P>
 Several scenarios are involved: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Florida beating Alabama for the SEC title on Dec. 3 would probably put the 
USC-Notre Dame winner in New Orleans to play the Gators. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Alabama beating Florida in the title game would probably put the Crimson 
Tide against Florida State in the Sugar. 
</P>
<P>
 The reason that game has an impact on USC-Notre Dame is that Florida plays 
Florida State this weekend, and the Sugar Bowl does not want a Florida-Florida 
State rematch. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Notre Dame wins, they're then a 7-4 team and an attractive team for us," 
Zatarain said. "USC is 8-3 with a win. Actually, the winner of that game would 
be in an excellent position for our game, or the Cotton or Fiesta bowl games, 
assuming Miami plays Nebraska in the Orange Bowl." 
</P>
<P>
 Zatarain will attend the Notre Dame-USC game. So will a representative of the 
Cotton Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both USC and Notre Dame are on our short list," said Rick Baker, executive 
director of the Cotton. 
</P>
<P>
 They join Florida State, which would probably play in Dallas on Jan. 2 if 
Florida beats Alabama. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sun Bowl is interested in USC and Notre Dame, regardless of the outcome of 
their game. 
</P>
<P>
 USC Athletic Director Mike Garrett said only, "We've been told the Sugar Bowl 
is very interested in the SC-Notre Dame winner." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Rose Bowl-bound Oregon (9-3), four other Pac-10 teams -- USC (7-3), 
Arizona (7-3), Washington State (7-4) and Washington (7-4) -- have enough 
victories, six, to qualify for a bowl. Washington, however, is ineligible 
because of Pac-10 sanctions.

COLLEGE FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; ACROSS THE NATION; GIBBS STEPS DOWN AS 
OKLAHOMA COACH

 Gary Gibbs inherited a scandal-ridden program, cleaned it up, and led Oklahoma 
to six consecutive winning seasons. It still wasn't enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs, who couldn't win the big games and championships that Oklahoma fans 
have come to expect, resigned Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've taken a bunch of bullet holes the past 5 1/2 years," he said. "This is a 
better program today than it was in '89." 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs replaced highly popular Barry Switzer, who won 157 games, three national 
championships and a dozen Big Eight titles in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibbs took over a team that was on probation. The program also had been shaken 
by a shooting, rape and drug arrest involving five Sooner players. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will coach the team through a bowl game, most likely the Copper 
Bowl on Dec. 29 at Arizona Stadium in Tucson. Copper Bowl officials are 
expected to invite Brigham Young to play the Sooners. 
</P>
<P>
 Athletic Director Donnie Duncan said he had no list of candidates to replace 
Gibbs, but he would like to hire a replacement by mid-December. 
</P>
<P>
 Oklahoma is 44-21-2 under Gibbs, has twice won nine games and is 2-0 in bowl 
games. But the Sooners have finished no better than third in the Big Eight, and 
are only 2-14-1 in games against the Sooners' biggest rivals -- Texas, Colorado 
and Nebraska. 
</P>

 Telephone circuits at the University of Oregon were jammed and the line of 
students waiting to buy Rose Bowl tickets stretched around Autzen Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that so many people are starved to go to the Rose Bowl that 
they'll do almost anything to get a ticket," said Tom Hager, the university's 
director of communications. 
</P>
<P>
 About 6,000 tickets allocated to students went on sale at 9 a.m. at the 
Casanova Athletic Center in Eugene. 
</P>
<P>
 The line of people waiting to buy them began forming Saturday, immediately 
after Oregon beat Oregon State, 17-13, to clinch its first Rose Bowl berth in 
37 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The university received 39,000 tickets. Sales were limited to students, 
season-ticket holders, athletic department donors and Alumni Association 
members.

 Ohio State Coach John Cooper, who a few weeks ago reportedly was in danger of 
losing his job, will meet with Athletic Director Andy Geiger to begin contract 
extension talks. . . . Mississippi will appeal the portion of the NCAA 
penalties against the school's football program dealing with a drastic 
reduction of scholarships. . . . Jim Marshall was fired after six seasons as 
head coach at the University of Richmond. Under Marshall, the Spiders were 
19-47.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 1994-95 PREVIEW; PACIFIC 10 / THE OTHER TEAMS; DEFENDING 
CHAMPION WILDCATS ARE BIGGER THAN EVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 These days, Lute Olson, never a nervous Nelly anyway, seems so comfortable 
with his team that he might as well snooze on the sideline. 
</P>
<P>
 Why? A few months after coaching Arizona to its second Final Four appearance 
in seven years, with a team UCLA Coach Jim Harrick says was probably less 
talented than four other Arizona teams he has coached against, Olson's Wildcats 
are stronger and bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona returns with senior guard Damon Stoudamire, a cast of several larger, 
more-athletic players and the swagger of a team that knows this season's 
edition is more talented than the one that lost to eventual champion Arkansas 
in the national semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Believe it or not, he's a better player than he was last year," Olson said of 
Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
 Believe it or not, in the Pacific 10 Conference, Arizona, last year's 
champion, is bigger; UCLA is deeper, and California and Arizona State are far 
more fit. 
</P>
<P>
 Sound familiar? 
</P>
<P>
 So, no, despite having lost Jason Kidd, Khalid Reeves and Lamond Murray, the 
Pac-10 hasn't undergone a total changing of the guards. 
</P>
<P>
 A brief look at the conference, team by team, excluding UCLA and USC: ARIZONA 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 29-6 overall, 14-4 Pac-10 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats lose Reeves' 24.2-point scoring average and streaky perimeter 
game, but Arizona still has Stoudamire's flash and dash, and should be able to 
replace Reeves with size reminiscent of the Sean Rooks-Brian Williams-Chris 
Mills days. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior center Joseph Blair, who emerged in the NCAA tournament, will get some 
help when 6-foot-8, 240-pound junior college transfer Ben Davis becomes 
eligible -- possibly as early as Dec. 22, when Arizona plays Syracuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis' arrival will allow senior forward Ray Owes, last season's leading 
rebounder, to move to small forward. Most important, that will free junior 
Reggie Geary, who, at 6-2, redefined the term small forward, to play as a 
guard, where he will run with Stoudamire. 
</P>
<P>
 Olson's tip: Freshman shooter Miles Simon will be one of the surprises in the 
league. CALIFORNIA 
</P>
<P>
 1993-94: 22-8, 13-5 
</P>
<P>
 Does having Alfred Grigsby and K.J. Roberts, who both missed most of the 
1993-94 season because of injuries, make up for losing Murray and Kidd to the 
pros? No way. Kidd and Murray combined for 41 points, 14.8 rebounds and 11 
assists a game. 
</P>
<P>
 But forward Grigsby and Roberts, who was the team's starting point guard 
before Kidd came along, were both major factors when they were injury-free. 
</P>
<P>

 Yes, Coach Bill Frieder is a wild man, and yes, if they get full seasons out 
of junior forward Mario Bennett and senior point guard Marcell Capers, the Sun 
Devils could challenge for the conference title. 
</P>
<P>
 A broken bone in his left foot sidelined Capers last year and chronic knee 
troubles limited Bennett, a dominant inside player, to 21 games. The injuries 
showed, especially during a 1-5 stretch during February that kept Arizona State 
out of the NCAA tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 But both players are back, joining a team that, as Frieder's teams typically 
are, is loaded with athletes who can press and shoot three-pointers, including 
guards Quincy Brewer and Isaac Burton and forward Ron Riley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time all 13 scholarship players are healthy at the start of 
the season," Frieder said. "I think we'll be real good." OREGON

 Coach Mike Montgomery says his team is young and weak inside, lacks depth and

Young, who is the Cardinal's first 7-footer since Rich Kelley in the 
early-'70s.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL: 1994-95 PREVIEW; RAVELING SAYS MOVE WAS HIS IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LONNIE WHITE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his first interview since retiring, former USC basketball coach George 
Raveling said Monday that stepping down was strictly his idea, that he had 
thought about quitting for the last three years and that he was not forced out 
by Athletic Director Mike Garrett. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sincerely believe that the whole thing about a feud between Mike and I has 
been misinterpreted," Raveling said. "Not one time since he was made athletic 
director did we ever even have an argument. For anyone to suggest that a 
problem between us led to my decision would be a disservice to both Mike and 
myself." 
</P>
<P>
 When Raveling, 57, announced his retirement through his attorney last week, he 
cited injuries he had suffered from a near-fatal auto accident Sept. 25. On 
Monday, however, he said that the accident had been only the final factor in a 
decision he had long been considering. 
</P>
<P>
 "Retiring is something I have thought about a lot over the last three years," 
Raveling said. "For most of our lives, retirement is something we all grapple 
with but for one reason or another we don't have the fortitude to go on and 
make a decision. We know we should, we think about it and think about it, but 
we just don't do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the accident did was force me to sit down and stare this thing right in 
the eye and make a decision. It wasn't just one thing (that led to his 
retirement) but I think that it was an accumulation of things." 
</P>
<P>
 Did he consider sitting out this season and returning next year? 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought about that but I really felt that it wasn't fair to the school or 
the players," he said. "The other thing was that I doubted seriously that any 
of the circumstances that motivated me to want to get out of coaching were 
going to change. Some of those things did not deal directly with USC or the 
present team." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, who suffered nine broken ribs, a broken collarbone and pelvis, and a 
collapsed lung in the accident, spent 22 years as a college head coach at 
Washington State, Iowa and USC. He said that if he had to start his coaching 
career today, he wouldn't do so because of how the game has changed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most fun in coaching I ever had was when I was at Washington State, 
because there was a different set of circumstances," he said. "The rules were 
different, the kids were different and the expectations were different. It was 
just fun to coach then. You really were a coach then. Today, it is coach, 
slash-slash-slash-slash. Coaching is the easiest part. Now, you have to deal 
with so many other things, from NCAA rules changes to public relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If my son (Mark) came up to me and asked me whether he should get into 
coaching or not, I would tell him, 'Don't do it.' The reason is that everything 
is so much different today. People only care if you win, and unfortunately, the 
real victories come off the court. Seeing a kid grow like (USC's) Mark Boyd, 
who had never slept in his own bed until he got here. To see him grow from a 
boy to a man, those are the real victories." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling said he was surprised by Colorado football Coach Bill McCartney's 
retirement announcement over the weekend but understood his reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pressure in coaching today is unreal," Raveling said. "Coaches today have 
to make enormous sacrifices. I have total empathy with (McCartney). I think 
that you are going to see more and more coaches leaving on their own terms." 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Raveling turned down a lucrative coaching offer from Seton Hall. He 
said he made his decision after talking to former Pirate Coach P.J. Carlesimo, 
who left Seton Hall to coach in the NBA at Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me that he didn't think that there was enough talent there to win 
more than nine games," Raveling said. "He also said that if I had decided to 
put up with that and then had a good recruiting year, I would look forward to 
two more losing seasons playing freshmen. So, I would be looking at three 
losing seasons in a row and I had to ask myself if I was ready to do that at 
this point in my career. I decided that I couldn't." 
</P>
<P>
 Raveling, who declined an invitation to be honored this weekend when USC plays 
Temple in the Martin Luther King Classic doubleheader at Memphis, plans to 
concentrate on his rehabilitation. Twice a week he returns to USC University 
Hospital for therapy and already has improved his strength. 
</P>
<P>
 "Right now, I'm not in any condition to travel," he said. "My goal is to get 
through this rehab process, which will run through the end of January. Every 
day is a mini-victory for me."

SALSA POSTPONES SERIES BECAUSE OF PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Salsa announced Monday that it is postponing its "United We Are" 
international soccer series, which matched the Salsa against teams from the 
Mexican First Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of Proposition 187, the voter-approved initiative that would cut off 
services to undocumented immigrants, the Mexican Soccer Federation council 
voted over the weekend not to allow its teams to play in California, with the 
exception of games with the Salsa. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Salsa and the council agreed to halt the series anyway. The next 
scheduled game was Wednesday against Atlis at Cal State Fullerton. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Mexican Federation has treated us like a partner in allowing us to 
continue to play in California," Salsa owner William De La Pena said. "We were 
asked to postpone the series and we are going to cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Refunds can be obtained by calling the Salsa office starting Monday. Or 
tickets may be used as two-for-one to any of the Salsa's next 16 games.

UNIVERSITY CHALLENGES LA MIRADA'S PLAYOFF STATUS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The football playoffs are under way, but not all the competition is taking 
place on the field. University High gets another crack at La Mirada at 1 p.m. 
today when it challenges the Suburban League's decision to allow the Matadores 
to continue in the Division VIII playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Late Friday afternoon, the Southern Section was alerted to the possibility 
that La Mirada used an ineligible player during the regular season, and the 
section contacted La Mirada about 3 1/2 hours before kickoff. La Mirada then 
beat University, 24-0. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, Suburban League principals met and determined that La Mirada 
would forfeit its 10 victories for using an ineligible player but be allowed to 
continue in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 So Diana Schmelzer, University principal, requested a hearing to express her 
school's concerns over the message the Suburban League is sending. She thinks 
La Mirada should forfeit its second-round game against Duarte. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a fine team and beat us fair and square without the ineligible 
player," Schmelzer said. "If they end up being champion, what is that saying to 
the rest of the world? That you can break the rules the whole season and go to 
the playoffs, and if you don't break the rules in the playoffs, it's OK? It's 
not a good statement to the kids. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a tough situation. The timing made it tougher (to postpone the game for 
a ruling)." 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern Section on Wednesday postponed one first-round playoff game, 
Canyon versus Loara, until Saturday. Loara didn't qualify for the playoffs, but 
took El Dorado's place when the Golden Hawks were discovered to have used an 
ineligible player and forfeited six victories. The only difference is the time 
of discovery. 
</P>
<P>
 La Mirada Principal Howard Haas said Monday his school was still investigating 
the player's eligibility and called it "a fine line." 
</P>
<P>
 "He was living in La Mirada, and there was a semester that he was at a 
different school (outside La Mirada) while living in La Mirada and came back 
the second semester (the spring of 1994)," Haas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the whole story was known by everyone, people would go 'Oh, that's fine 
this is happening.' Sometimes you have to make decisions which are best for 
students. . . . No question, we should be able to continue on." 
</P>
<P>
 Haas said a precedent was set last year at Antelope Valley, where the football 
team dropped from 8-2 to 5-5 after forfeits, but the Golden League, upon 
then-Principal John Hutek's appeal, allowed the Antelopes to play on. They won 
two playoff games before losing.  
</P>
<P>
 "The position I took was that there's a letter of the rule and a spirit of the 
rule," Hutek said. "The punishment didn't fit the crime. It wasn't done to 
alter the level of the playing field. The spirit of the rule was written to 
make sure the playing field remained even.  
</P>
<P>
 "We (ultimately) had to give up our status and our ranking. We were unable to 
boast the win-loss record and we were on probationary status for a period of 
time and held accountable for any paper clearances that might arise, which is 
what it was that got us in trouble in the first place. That was more 
reasonable." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Schmelzer, University's principal: "We (the football team) are not 
practicing. This is not an issue about University High School. This is about 
fairness and logical consequences for actions."

ANGELS STILL TRYING TO TRADE FOR PITCHING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Angels, desperately searching for a right-handed starter, are talking 
about a potential trade with the Chicago Cubs for pitcher Willie Banks in a 
deal that would include Angel center fielder Chad Curtis. 
</P>
<P>
 Cub General Manager Ed Lynch said Monday that he and Angel General Manager 
Bill Bavasi have had preliminary talks, but a deal probably would be delayed 
until baseball's labor strife is resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "Curtis is a guy whose name came up in our discussions," Lynch said, "but we 
didn't talk specifics. We do need a center fielder, and Curtis is someone I 
inquired about." 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, according to sources, considers Curtis the second-best center fielder 
available on the trade market behind Steve Finley of the Houston Astros. Finley 
is scheduled to earn $4.25 million in 1995, compared to Curtis' $1.9-million 
salary. 
</P>
<P>
 "We made it clear that we want a strong defensive center fielder," Lynch said. 
"But right now, we're going to have to wait to see who's going to be a free 
agent. We don't want to box ourselves into a situation where four- or five-year 
guys suddenly become free agents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to wait to see what system we're under." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, according to sources, are willing to quickly make a deal. They 
project that Banks, 8-12 with a 5.40 earned-run average last season, could be 
the No. 3 starter in their rotation and might be their only right-hander. 
</P>
<P>
 A deal also would free the Angels of the $3.9 million they owe Curtis for the 
next two seasons. The Angels would like to replace Curtis with free-agent 
center fielder Darrin Jackson, according to a club source.

FREEDOM BOWL SIGNS NEW SPONSOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE DiGIOVANNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Freedom Bowl received some financial relief Monday with the addition of 
Bank of America as a presenting sponsor, signing a two-year deal that will pump 
"in excess of six figures," into the postseason college football game in 
Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 With expenses rising -- the NCAA increased its minimum bowl-game payout from 
$500,000 per team in 1991 to $750,000 this year -- and gate receipts 
fluctuating from year to year, the Freedom Bowl's budget deficit has risen to 
about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But the presenting sponsorship should enable the Freedom Bowl to at least 
cover annual expenses and prevent the deficit from growing, according to Don 
Andersen, executive director of the Orange County Sports Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "With ticket sales from the two conferences (Pacific 10 and Western Athletic), 
the television contract (with Raycom) and the Bank of America deal, it 
guarantees that we're going to cover all our payments," Andersen said. "There's 
a certain comfort in that, obviously." 
</P>
<P>
 Andersen said the Freedom Bowl, which will be played for the 11th time Dec. 
27, was not in danger of being discontinued like the Pigskin Classic, the 
preseason game that recently lost its title sponsorship from Disneyland and 
will not return to Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 "But this keeps us out of that range," said Andersen, who is still seeking a 
title sponsor for the Freedom Bowl. "Down the line we could have gotten into 
that position. This puts us over the hump. It's a real step forward for the 
game." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's Freedom Bowl will feature Utah (9-2) against either Arizona or 
Washington State. The outcomes of Arizona's game against Arizona State Friday 
night in Tucson and the USC-Notre Dame game Saturday in Los Angeles will 
determine the the Utes' opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Utes, No. 13 in the CNN-USA Today coaches poll, are the highest ranked 
team to play in the game, and their record equals the previous Freedom 
Bowl-best of Tulsa, which was 9-2 entering the 1991 game against San Diego 
State.

 Robert Griffin dropped his slender, battered frame in the chair at the end of 
the row last season and reflected on the preceding few minutes of torture. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin, then a Tustin High sophomore guard, had been manhandled -- again -- 
by the opposition and a disturbing realization crept into his head: No matter 
how Griffin tried to convince himself otherwise, he wasn't ready for varsity 
basketball. Incredible shooting range Griffin possessed; strength and ability 
to play defense he didn't. 
</P>
<P>
 The heaping dose of reality was exactly what Griffin needed. He committed 
himself to improving his game during the summer, and the payoff is a starting 
position in the Tillers' backcourt this season. He's expected to provide a 
long-range presence that should help Tustin outdistance its Golden West League 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people were telling me I belonged on the varsity, and I thought I 
did, but I really didn't and it showed," Griffin said. "But it kind of helped 
me. It made me work harder and it made me a better player." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that the kid was devoid of skills, mind you. 
</P>
<P>
 In basketball vernacular, Griffin is what is known as a "gunner." 
</P>
<P>
 "He has deep range, 25 or 30 feet -- seriously," Tustin Coach Andy Ground 
said. "Potentially, he could be the best shooter in the league." 
</P>
<P>
 This potential prompted Ground to have Griffin play with the varsity at times. 
Griffin was supposed to help loosen tight zone defenses by consistently making 
jumpers. And the plan's success rate was decent. But, oh, did Griffin pay for 
the privilege. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had no size," he said. "I was getting pushed around all over the place." 
</P>
<P>
 The math was simple: 145 pounds on a 6-foot-1 basketball player is not a 
formula for longevity. Griffin acquainted himself, in earnest, with weights for 
the first time, working in lifting with his daily shooting regimen. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, Ground noticed problems with his plan for Griffin. Early in the 
season, Ground decided it would be best for Griffin to spend the majority of 
his time with the junior varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 Although slightly disappointed, Griffin realized it was for the best. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to play, but since I didn't play a lot (on the varsity) it was a 
little frustrating," Griffin said. "Coach Ground told me, 'Shoot the ball as 
much as you can on the JV.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He listened well. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin shot enough to average 24 points. Moreover, he applied himself to 
learning defense, a concept he used to let others worry about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found out I couldn't play defense on the varsity," Griffin said. "Everybody 
said that varsity wasn't a big difference from the JV, but it's not even like 
that. Everyone was a little bigger, a little stronger and a little faster." 
</P>
<P>
 By playoff time, Griffin had already made strides. He contributed some timely 
outside shooting, and improved defense, to the Tillers' strong postseason run, 
which Compton Dominguez ended, 70-35, in the Southern Section Division II-A 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin attended two summer basketball camps in which he continued to 
concentrate on his defense. Through weight lifting he's added about 15 pounds 
of muscle and his weight now hovers around 160. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really emerged during the summer," Ground said. "He'll be able to play 32 
minutes a game for us with the body he has now. He probably couldn't play more 
than six minutes before." 
</P>
<P>
 Ground expects Griffin to be the Tillers' third-leading scorer behind standout 
senior point guard Doug Gottlieb and talented senior forward David Lalazarian. 
Ground said Griffin will probably average about 10 shots, most of which he'll 
attempt from behind the three-point arc. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Doug and David weren't around, he'd score a lot of points this season," 
Ground said. "But this will help him get ready for next year when he'll have to 
score a lot for us." 
</P>
<P>
 Griffin is content with his role. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not a selfish player," he said. "I like to shoot but I also like to 
pass."

 ON CUE: North Hollywood's Ernie Gutierrez is a legend, and he's not even dead 
yet. He's known around the world for crafting ornate custom pool cues. His 
customers have included Minnesota Fats and Frank Sinatra (B1). . . . Many in 
Hollywood came to him after he made an 18-karat gold cue for Dean Martin. It 
also had four diamonds, an emerald, a ruby and a sapphire.

 DON'T BEAM US UP: The new Star Trek picture may be succeeding in its mission 
at the box office, but it's a big misfire for many fans. Joyce Mason, head of a 
William Shatner fan club in North Hollywood, said most who called her 
syndicated cable radio show, "Talk Trek," Friday night weighed in against "Star 
Trek: Generations." . . . "Many people said they felt empty when they left the 
theater," Mason says.

 TROUBLES: Small banks may have survived big problems, but they're not home 
free yet. Institutions such as Valencia National Bank in Newhall, run by John 
Reardon, above, still face the prospect of being gobbled up by larger banks. . 
. . Community banking, says Marshall Milligan, outgoing CEO of Bank of A. Levy 
in Ventura, will "go the way of blacksmiths and butcher shops." See Valley 
Business, Page 10.

 QUAKE LOANS: For some renters, the American Dream was made possible, believe 
it or not, by the Northridge nightmare. They got help through the California 
Housing Financing Agency, which provides low-interest loans to those who 
suffered quake damage. . . . "It's been the forgotten loan program," says John 
Lucas of ARCS Mortgage Inc. in Van Nuys. See Valley Business, Page 4. 
</P>
<P>
 TAX BREAK: But what if you already owned property before the quake and 
suffered damage? Can you get a tax break? Yes, but it won't be easy. You'll 
need to show how you paid for your belongings and you may want to minimize 
income this year. . . . Today's Your Money pages looks at this and other tax 
issues (D6-9). Michael Arkush

 TOUCHY ISSUE: Ever see a lot of compassion at school board meetings? The 
Irvine Unified School District has adopted its first-ever ethics code, and the 
only argument at all came on the wording of its "compassion" section. It calls 
for board members to "exhibit generosity and love" toward their fellow board 
colleagues. . . . Objected board member Mary Ellen Hadley: "I love 
'touchy-feely,' but this is too much for me." She finally voted with the 
others, adding: "If we need to love one another, then I guess that's OK."

 K'S ANGEL: Some people are upset with Orange County's two new Super Kmarts, 
convinced they'll hurt smaller businesses. But Kmart officials expect only 
happy campers this afternoon, when veteran TV actress Jaclyn Smith signs 
autographs and promotes her clothing line at the new Anaheim Hills Super Kmart. 
. . . One reason Kmarts love her so: They've sold 35 million pieces with her 
name on them since Smith signed on with Kmart nine years ago.

 REVISED THINKING: It came as a shocker to young people at the Castille 
Elementary School in Mission Viejo, when noted children's author Connie Porter 
told them Monday that she usually does many revisions of her writing. "Most 
students never want to write anything more than once," chuckled principal Susan 
McGill. "This was learning experience for them." . . . Porter, whose "Addy" 
series is a hit on the children's bestseller list, urged students never to 
limit their imagination.

 HOLIDAY HARVEST: Disneyland is getting its own winter blizzard -- of 
poinsettias. Beginning today, Disney gardeners will plant 20,000 of the 
traditional holiday flowers. Most of the plants that will be popping up around 
the theme park will be red, of course, but there will be other colors, 
including speckled. . . . Says its landscaping crew chief, Karen Hedges: "To 
see 1,000 colorful poinsettias in a bed is spectacular."

JANET AHLBERG; AWARD-WINNING ILLUSTRATOR OF CHILDREN'S BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Janet Ahlberg, 50, the illustrator who teamed up with her writer husband to 
create "The Jolly Postman" and other award-winning books for children. She was 
bored with her job as a magazine editor and illustrator of craft books when she 
begged her husband, Allan, to write a children's story for her to 
illustrate."The Brick Street Boys" series began in 1975. Then came "'Burglar 
Bill" in 1977, about a burglar who steals a baby. "Each Peach Pear Plum," with 
pages of intricately drawn nursery characters, published in 1978, won Mrs. 
Ahlberg the Kate Greenaway Medal for illustration, sponsored by the Library 
Assn. But her first major success was "The Jolly Postman," published in 1986 
after five years of work. It won the Maschler Award for balance of word and 
illustration, and Mrs. Ahlberg won another Greenaway Medal. The book, which 
sold more than 1 million copies, shows a postal carrier delivering letters 
tucked inside real envelopes, for readers to open and peruse. "The Jolly 
Christmas Postman" followed in 1991, and "Jolly Pocket Postman" will be 
published next year. On Nov. 15 in Leicester, England, of cancer.

MILTON GREENBLATT; PSYCHIATRIST STUDIED LSD INFLUENCE ON PATIENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Milton Greenblatt, a psychiatrist who held academic appointments ranging from 
Harvard to UCLA and whose research included a controversial study of patients 
under the influence of LSD, has died. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Margaret, said Greenblatt was 80 when he died Thursday in a Ventura 
hospital of congestive heart failure.The family had moved to Ventura after 
living in Sherman Oaks for several years. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenblatt's history in the mental health field dated to the primitive days 
when controversial drugs were administered to unwilling patients who had had 
their shoes removed to prevent them being used as weapons. During the 1970s and 
1980s he had been director of UCLA's Neuropsychiatric Institute hospital and 
chief psychiatrist at Olive View Medical Center in the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Before that he taught at Harvard and Boston universities and after moving West 
became director of psychiatry at the Sepulveda Veterans Hospital near UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1981 he co-authored a report that grew out of a study of 1,000 veterans who 
complained of substandard and inadequate care at veterans hospitals. Many of 
their complaints were justified, he found. 
</P>
<P>
 His research ranged from lobotomies to schizophrenia to alcoholism. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 1950s he oversaw a program at what was then Boston Psychopathic 
Hospital, in which mentally ill patients were given LSD to see if it improved 
their condition. The project became known nationally when one of the patients 
hanged herself. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to his wife, Greenblatt is survived by two sons, three grandsons 
and a great-granddaughter.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; WONDERFUL WAY TO LAUNCH THE SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Thanksgiving marks the traditional start of the holiday season, and also of a 
time when people are more likely to think of the less fortunate. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, Boy Scouts fanned out across Orange County to collect food. 
About 20,000 Scouts, parents and volunteers from county National Guard units 
helped in the annual food drive, an impressive turnout. Equally noteworthy was 
the bounty: nearly 400,000 pounds of food. A Boy Scouts spokesman said the 
canned food would be distributed to 280 agencies throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 The need for assistance is obvious to anyone who drives around the county. 
Homeless men and women -- and too often, children -- sleep in parks; the lucky 
ones have cars to protect them from the cold. At freeway off-ramps and street 
medians, people display signs offering to work for food. 
</P>
<P>
 Even for those with roofs over their heads, hunger can be a problem. In Irvine 
last weekend, the annual outreach program of Irvine Temporary Housing Inc. 
distributed holiday food baskets to about 150 families in the city. Local 
businesses, religious groups and service organizations donated the food, and 
deserve support for their efforts. The baskets included not just Thanksgiving 
provisions but enough food to last a week. In Los Alamitos, volunteers from We 
Care of Los Alamitos also presented food baskets, helping about 140 families. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a sign of the times that organizers of the Irvine event had worried they 
would not have enough food; they were bailed out by last-minute donations. With 
businesses closing and the survivors facing tough times, it has become more 
difficult to find companies and individuals with money to give, officials of 
many charitable organizations said. In some cases, people who in the past would 
have been donors of money or food now need it themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But in a county known for its affluence, the charitable impulse is nice to 
see. One man volunteered to help distribute the potatoes and turkeys at Irvine 
Temporary Housing offices even though one of his arms was in a sling due to 
shoulder surgery. And his 12-year-old daughter struck the right note when she 
proclaimed the value of lending a hand in her community and helping "people get 
back on their feet." 
</P>
<P>
 Many people in Orange County are only one or two paychecks away from going 
hungry. A job loss or an unexpected medical bill can push people over the edge. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Help is needed year-round, but in this season especially, it is good to share 
the wealth.

ORANGE COUNTY VOICES; UPLIFTING TRIBUTE TO A LOCAL RITE OF PASSAGE; LANDMARKS: 
IT SEEMS AS IF EVERYONE RODE DISNEYLAND'S SKYWAY FROM THE POLYESTER-CLAD WORLD 
OF TOMMOROWLAND TO THE KINDER AND GENTLER FANTASYLAND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BLISS, Jeff Bliss is a former Disneyland employee. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Disneyland has closed down one of its landmark rides, Skyway. 
</P>
<P>
 Just the very mention of its name evokes so many memories: from stealing 
kisses high above the madding crowd on Grad Night to showering unsuspecting 
fellow guests below with candy or popcorn. And from what I've gathered over the 
years, Skyway was a shared experience, perhaps even a rite of passage for most 
who grew up in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 But for me it will always be a little more special. As a youngster I dreamed 
of working at "The Happiest Place on Earth," and as a college student I was 
granted that wish. My mom used to say "be careful what you wish for -- you 
might get it," and so it was that I joined the Legion of the Mouse. Not as the 
wisecracking Jungle Cruise guide that I had hoped to be, but instead as one of 
the few, the proud, the pseudo-Swiss costumed Skyway Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, that same ride (or "attraction" as it is properly referred to by all 
Disney University graduates) where I terrorized tourists as a child, raining 
hard candies down upon their noggins, was to become my home for several summers 
and holidays. Call it karma . . . cosmic payback . . . my mom also used to say 
"God punishes" whenever we did something wrong and got away with it in the 
present -- we were sure to get it later, and I did. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way I pulled kids off the ride who were swinging the suspended 
cabins so hard you'd think they were going to pull the line off the towers 
holding them up. We chewed out kids who spit on the guests below -- they were 
known as "expectorators." And on a few occasions I had to call a security 
officer over to lecture kids who were beaning guests with their projectiles of 
choice. (It was nice to see that the hard, lemon candies were still a weapon of 
tradition.) 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone rode Skyway. We got the chance to meet stars, beauty queens, top 
athletes and a multitude of international visitors. Some of us prided ourselves 
on being able to say, "Please step out (of the ride) and watch your head" in 
several different languages. We also had the opportunity to clean out the ride 
when people left dirty diapers behind; deal with irate guests who thought drugs 
and alcoholic beverages were part of the in-flight service, and put up with 
some union old-timers who regarded seasonal workers about the same as gum on 
the bottom of their shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Skyway became one of the best experiences of my life (is that a pitiful 
commentary on it?). It was a place where friendships were born, havoc was 
raised and little epiphanies were realized. 
</P>
<P>
 Skyway, where ski lift-type gondolas -- or buckets -- carried passengers high 
above the teeming park floor below, from the polyester-clad world of 
Tommorowland to the kinder and gentler Fantasyland. It was one of the few 
glimpses of reality that guests could enjoy during their visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Up above the world so high, people in the buckets could see behind the facades 
and beyond the fences that blocked out life's ugly realities. I never thought 
it took away anything from the atmosphere, it only made the inside a little 
more special. You appreciated the fantasy a little more. 
</P>
<P>
 But hey, let's not get maudlin here. After all, it's just a ride, er, I mean 
attraction. It's not like the time someone stole Mr. Lincoln's parts. 
</P>
<P>
 So now the Imagineers, engineers and Disney accountants scramble to pack away 
a part of the park's great heritage, adding it to a list that includes such 
greats as Mike Fink's Keel Boats, America the Beautiful, Rocket to the Moon and 
the completely forgotten mule ride (you could smell the stench all the way over 
in Garden Grove). 
</P>
<P>
 I'm sorry to see it go -- it breaks my heart. I still have an old bag of hard 
candies I never used.

ROLLS-ROYCE PLANS TO BUY RIVAL JET ENGINE MAKER ALLISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 British jet engine maker Rolls-Royce will buy competitor Allison Engine Co. 
for $525 million, the companies announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase will allow Rolls-Royce to provide engines to half the markets for 
military aircraft in the Western World, said John W. Sandford, managing 
director of Rolls' aerospace group. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see this as an opportunity to grow," Sandford said at a news conference. 
"We do not see any closing down of plants." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be the second sale of Allison in just over a year. General Motors 
Corp. agreed to sell the company last fall for $300 million to Clayton, 
Dubilier & Rice Inc., a New York investment firm, and a group of Allison 
managers. The deal was finalized in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal with Rolls-Royce, Indianapolis-based Allison, which employs 
4,300 people in three Indiana plants, will keep its name. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale, which will be made through the sale of stock, is subject to approval 
by the U.S. and British governments. Rolls predicted it will acquire the 
debt-free Allison by spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Rolls said the deal would also allow it to centralize its North American 
aerospace operations. "With time, most of our aerospace business will have a 
strong presence in Indianapolis," Sandford said, adding that it might take two 
to three years. 
</P>
<P>
 He said job growth would come through increased sales and relocation of some 
Rolls employees and operations to Indianapolis. 
</P>
<P>
 If the deal is approved, Rolls will promote four new Allison-made aircraft 
engines that are now entering the marketplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandford predicted that "99.9%" of Allison managers would remain in place. But 
Allison Chairman and Chief Executive Blake Wallace said he will be leaving. He 
said he rejected a job offer from Rolls because it was "not what I intended to 
do." Wallace did not define the job.

THEATER REVIEW; 'VITA AND VIRGINIA': A MASTERFUL DANCE OF TWO WOMEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAURIE WINER, TIMES THEATER CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Is the gift of intellectual brilliance worth the cost of spontaneity, of 
sensuality, of sexual and physical confidence? Fleshed out by two extraordinary 
actresses, that is the central, riveting question raised in "Vita and 
Virginia," which opened Monday at the Union Square Theatre. 
</P>
<P>
 This epistolary play is directed by a third great actress, Zoe Caldwell, as an 
intense conversation between two sinuously verbal women. It chronicles what is 
if not the most passionate literary love affair of the century then at least 
one of the most thoroughly documented ones. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Vita and Virginia," Vanessa Redgrave -- one of the greatest actresses of 
our time -- plays a woman who is at best a second-rate artist, the poet and 
novelist Vita Sackville-West. Wife of diplomat Harold Nicholson, Vita had an 
aristocratic pedigree dating back to the time of William the Conqueror, an 
ancestry that was part of her appeal to the snob in Virginia Woolf. Woolf, of 
course, was a distinctly first-rate writer, and this was enormously attractive 
to Vita. 
</P>
<P>
 Eileen Atkins adapted the play from the women's correspondence, and here she 
reprises the intellectually passionate but rather severe and sexually prim 
Virginia she played in her one-woman show "A Room of One's Own," which she 
adapted from a Woolf essay of the same name. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If the snob in Virginia discreetly coveted Vita's noble birth, the 
intellectual in her worshiped Vita's elegant sensuality. At the same time, 
Virginia deeply feared Vita's attraction to and attractiveness to several other 
women. Redgrave doesn't so much enter her role as infuse it with an 
intoxication for life and travel, whether Vita is rhapsodizing about the 
Persian prime minister's red beard or the loveliest fish in a Hollywood 
aquarium. 
</P>
<P>
 In life Redgrave is often aggressively unfashionable in her dress and her 
political views. She seems to feel extraordinarily comfortable, however, in 
playing Vita as elegance personified. Everything she wears is long and stylish: 
the lace-up boots that climb up above her knee, the shimmering rope of pearls 
that reaches suggestively down past her belly, the endless fox that encircles 
her neck. The only thing short about Vita is her henna-brown hair, in a bob a 
la Dorothy Hamill, only chic. As she expounds passionately about whatever she 
experiences, her bangs fall boyishly into her stunning blue eyes, as if she 
knows she has beauty to spare. When she drapes her legs over the seat of a 
divan, she looks like a coltish, growing boy, like the ageless, timeless, 
pan-sexual Orlando, the character that Woolf created as a tribute to Vita. 
(Both actresses are considerably older than the parts they are playing, which 
given these performances should bother none but the most literal minded.) 
</P>
<P>
 Atkins' performance makes explicit how Virginia had a much guiltier 
relationship to pleasure. She plays the impartial observer (referring to Vita 
as "an avowed Sapphist" as if she herself were ruggedly heterosexual), but her 
ruse is thoroughly betrayed by the frankly carnal way Atkins stares at 
Redgrave, like a spider who doesn't care how she looks to the fly in her web. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The distribution of power between the women constantly shifts because they 
each have their unquestioned areas of dominance. Vita breathlessly describes 
every new novel of Virginia's as "dazzling" but with a nervous awareness that 
she can never rival her friend's powers of description. Vita, however, is 
clearly the better writer of love letters, hands down. She is able to say, 
plainly, "I miss you in a simple, desperate way," something Virginia can never 
seem to do. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact Vita complains of Virginia's too perfect phrasing, which seems to 
douse passion. She claims, rightly, that Virginia remains aloof from all the 
"jolly vulgarity" of life. And indeed, Virginia's brilliance needs nothing to 
dance off of; though she shares with Vita her perfect, devastating descriptions 
of dinner party guests, Virginia's art is a solo act. 
</P>
<P>
 Virginia wrote "Orlando" at least in part out of insecurity, as an attempt to 
bind Vita, who was simultaneously conducting affairs with poet Dorothy 
Wellesley, the 28-year-old Mary Campbell, and perhaps others. In the novel, 
which Vita inevitably found "dazzling," Virginia describes the naked male 
Orlando: "No human being, since the world began, has ever looked more 
ravishing." When Orlando turns into a woman, she is "loveliness incarnate." 
</P>
<P>
 "Vita and Virginia" explores the interplay of art and life, and finds the 
ennobling and yet stultifying achievement of literary perfection as something 
less divine than living life fully. As a dramatic experience, however, the play 
is hindered by its form; the two characters cross in the mail and never really 
connect to each other at the same time. The play itself, in fact, is hindered 
by the very thing that defines its themes -- the one who writes beautifully 
doesn't seem to live as fully, and the one who can't write well is the more 
sublime character. As a dramatic work at two and a half hours, "Vita and 
Virginia" does not always shine, but as a set piece for two terrific actresses, 
it is a jewel.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; ONCE THEY PUT IT IN DRIVE, GO-GO'S GET BACK ON A ROLL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Reclaiming the concert stage after a nearly 10-year absence (discounting a 
1990 mini-tour), the Go-Go's kicked off a tour on Sunday at the Coach House 
that hits the Wiltern Theatre on Dec. 1 and 2. 
</P>
<P>
 In the early '80s, the Los Angeles quintet first proved that an all-female 
rock band could be successful -- topping the charts with their dolled-up garage 
rock.They then proved they were also equal to their male counterparts in 
substance abuse, infighting and other band-wrecking skills that led the Go-Go's 
to disband in 1985. 
</P>
<P>
 Now they're back to prove that females, too, can cash in on their legacies. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first several songs, though, singer Belinda Carlisle neither connected 
with the lyrics nor particularly landed on the right notes. There was scarcely 
more musical precision from her band mates -- guitarist Jane Wiedlin, bassist 
Kathy Valentine, drummer Gina Schock and ex-Bangle Vicki Peterson on lead 
guitar (subbing for a pregnant Charlotte Caffey). 
</P>
<P>
 But those shortcomings either vanished or ceased to matter by the seventh 
song, the effervescent power pop of "This Town." From that point to the 
conclusion 14 songs later with "Let's Have a Party," the Go-Go's made a 
persuasive, celebratory case for their curious mix of punky drive and 
bittersweet pop confection. 
</P>
<P>
 The group says they are planning a true reunion this time, which seems 
promising considering that new songs held up alongside old favorites.

CHALK HIM UP FOR GREATNESS; ERNIE GUTIERREZ -- MASTER CUE MAKER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So what if George Balabushka is to billiard cues what Antonio Stradivari is to 
violins? Ernie Gutierrez likewise is a legend -- scratch that, a living legend 
-- who has grown just a little tired of living in the master cue maker's shadow 
for the past three decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez is world-famous in his own right -- crafting ornate custom cues with 
elaborate materials, including ivory, gold, jewels and rare and exotic woods. 
Several of Gutierrez's cues -- valued at as much as $10,000 apiece -- have slid 
between the fingers of billiard greats Willie Mosconi and Minnesota Fats. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the pros, pool-playing celebrities -- including Frank Sinatra, Dean 
Martin and Sammy Davis Jr. in their "Rat Pack" prime -- trod a path to his 
door. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite his reputation as one of the world's best living cue makers, 
Gutierrez says he still competes with the ghost of Balabushka, who died in 
1975. 
</P>
<P>
 "Balabushka is still, probably, more famous than me because he's dead and a 
lot of his cues have become collectibles," said Gutierrez, 53, who made his 
first cue in 1961. "But I've been more innovative. He was a very good machinist 
and he did some good work. But as far as art is concerned. . . . I've got the 
six ball over him." 
</P>
<P>
 Spoken like the pool hustler he once aspired to be. 
</P>
<P>
 But if current trends continue, he may be proven correct. Gutierrez's fame 
assuredly will escalate with the value of his cues once he joins Balabushka in 
that Great Pool Hall in the Sky. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, he figures to create a few more glittery, jewel-encrusted sticks 
in styles that would have even Balabushka racking his brain. Unlike his 
predecessor, Gutierrez has at his disposal computer-assisted lathes to more 
precisely fashion the perfect pool cue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ernie Gutierrez came along and put the artwork into making cues," said Terry 
Moldenhauer, owner of AAA Billiards, a supply store in North Hollywood, and a 
collector of custom cues. "He is, in my opinion, the world's greatest living 
cue maker." 
</P>
<P>
 That assessment was all but confirmed in July, when Gutierrez became the first 
living member inducted into the American Cuemakers Assn. Hall of Fame in 
Houston. Balabushka, of course, was the first to be enshrined. 
</P>
<P>
 But whose cues reign supreme? 
</P>
<P>
 "It's difficult to make comparisons between the two," said Victor Stein, 
co-author of the recently released book, "The Billiard Encyclopedia." 
</P>
<P>
 "Balabushka's work was never very elaborate or fancy. He made a different kind 
of cue that played very well and many pro players used," Stein said. "Ernie 
Gutierrez is a true artist and a craftsman. Today, now that we have collectible 
cues, the way a cue looks is very important." 
</P>
<P>
 The craft of cue making can be traced to 17th-Century Europe, where the game 
of billiards was a passion among nobility. Marie Antoinette is said to have 
cherished her solid-ivory queue de billard. Since 1850, cue making has 
flourished in the United States, where most of the world's cues are made today. 
</P>
<P>
 Only within the past several years, however, has cue collecting joined the 
sports memorabilia craze. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of Balabushka's approximately 1,200 cues have sold and resold for 
thousands of dollars. Within the last year, a Balabushka original reportedly 
changed hands for $45,000 in New York. Lofty prices also have been paid for 
custom cues made by Harvey Martin, Herman Rambow and Gus Szamboti, all 
legendary cue makers now deceased. 
</P>
<P>
 Cues from Gutierrez's assemblage of about 2,500 already are among the most 
expensive and sought-after items, partly because of the construction materials. 
In April, an ivory-and-silver Gutierrez cue sold in Japan for the equivalent of 
$32,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez has refused offers of up to $65,000 for the 1966 cue he considers 
his masterpiece. Made with ivory, ebony, silver and maple, it features two 
interchangeable shafts, as well as a matching case with the same engraving 
found on the cue's silver inlays. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very attached to it because I know how hard I worked on it and I know how 
primitive my shop was when I built it," Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez also has worked as an automotive and aerospace designer over the 
years. But his first love has remained crafting cues. He was trained in 
woodworking as a youth in his native Colombia before moving to the San Fernando 
Valley in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 He also liked to play pool, especially for money. Shortly after his arrival in 
Southern California, Gutierrez began hanging out in pool halls, playing for 
pocket change with cues he had begun to make for himself. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, interest in the game skyrocketed with the release of the movie, "The 
Hustler," starring Paul Newman and Jackie Gleason. Gutierrez figured to cash in 
by selling his cues. Six days after the birth of his daughter, Gina, Gutierrez 
launched his cue-making company: Ginacue. 
</P>
<P>
 Ginacues, about 100 of which are made a year, have since become among the most 
widely copied cues in the billiard industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost every cue maker in the world has at least one thing in their designs 
that originated with Ernie," said James Buss, president of the American 
Cuemakers' Assn. and a cue maker. "There's a joke in the pool industry that 
Ernie invented ivory and he invented silver." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Balabushka, by a general consensus of billiard buffs, remains the master 
-- although much of his legend can be chalked up to mystique. 
</P>
<P>
 Balabushka, a Russian immigrant who worked in New York City his entire career, 
owned only one lathe, which he used to craft every cue he made. When a visitor 
entered his shop, he reportedly would stop working, fearing his techniques 
would be learned. 
</P>
<P>
 Balabushka's woodworking skills are said to have been unparalleled. In fact, 
few friends were ever aware that he had crafted his own wooden finger after 
losing his middle finger in a band saw accident. 
</P>
<P>
 In New York, a mecca of the billiard world during the 1950s and '60s, 
Balabushka frequently rubbed shoulders with the game's top professionals, and 
many used his cues. His immortality was heightened with the 1986 film "The 
Color of Money," in which a young pool hustler portrayed by Tom Cruise proudly 
unveils his cherished Balabushka cue before a poolroom full of awed observers. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many modern cues today that play as well as a Balabushka, but his 
cues have a (mystique) about them," Buss said. "A cue I make that sells for 
$500 would sell for thousands if he (had) made it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gutierrez, working his entire career on the West Coast, made his mark by 
taking his flashiest cues to major tournaments and unveiling them before top 
pros. Most players were impressed, but not all preferred Ginacues. Mosconi, 
considered the game's greatest player, tried his hand with a Ginacue, only to 
return to the cherished Rambow cue said to have been his favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 But as photographs of Gutierrez's ivory-laden works began appearing in 
publications throughout the world, he became sought-after by players with a 
taste for classy cues. That included Minnesota Fats, who has owned three 
Ginacues.

<P>
 "Fats loved this cue," Gutierrez said, grasping his prize piece. "He said he 
had never seen anything like it. One of my friends took this cue and showed it 
to him and he wanted to meet me." 
</P>
<P>
 So did many of Hollywood's billiard crowd after seeing the 18-karat-gold cue 
Gutierrez made for Dean Martin in 1968. Profiled in Sports Illustrated along 
with its maker, the cue featured four diamonds, an emerald, a ruby and a 
sapphire. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost overnight, Gutierrez was receiving more orders from movie stars than he 
could shake a stick at. His customers have included Peter Falk, Peter Lawford 
and Jerry Lewis. Recently, the cue he crafted for Martin was returned to his 
shop for repair. Its owner was actor James Caan. 
</P>
<P>
 "They all started to come by word of mouth," Gutierrez said. "It's 
flattering." 
</P>
<P>
 So too are comparisons to Balabushka. The two men never met, although they 
spoke by telephone on occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I regret that I never met him," Gutierrez said. "He didn't know my equipment, 
I didn't know his. He didn't know my techniques, I didn't know his. He did his 
work his way, I did mine my way. There was mutual respect." 
</P>
<P>
 Stein, who spent six years doing research for his book, said comparing 
Balabushka to Gutierrez is like comparing Babe Ruth to a great modern-day 
ballplayer. "Their styles are so different," Stein said. "They're both artists. 
When you do something like (make cues) for so long, you almost have to be 
judged after you die."

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WESTLAKE VILLAGE; COUNCIL MEETS DEC. 7 TO SELECT NEW MAYOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Westlake Village City Council will hold a special meeting Dec. 7 to select 
a new mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will be at 7:30 p.m. at the City Hall Council Chambers, 4373 Park 
Terrace Drive.There will be a reception for the new mayor following the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Traditionally, the council has tapped the mayor pro tem to succeed the mayor, 
said Mayor Doug Yarrow. The mayor pro tem this year is Kenneth Rufener. 
</P>
<P>
 Rufener, who was elected to the council in 1987, was on vacation and could not 
be reached for comment Monday.  
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, he narrowly defeated challenger Daniel Murphy, who campaigned on a 
platform to oppose a controversial large-scale housing development proposed by 
the Baldwin Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Rufener, who was mayor at the time, maintained that under the city's General 
Plan the developer legally had the right to build 330 homes on the shores of 
Las Virgenes Reservoir. The city could be sued if it opposed the project 
without good cause, Rufener argued. 
</P>
<P>
 The project never materialized and the land is still vacant, according to city 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Yarrow, elected to the council in 1989, said he has enjoyed his term as mayor. 
Particularly satisfying, he said, was helping the city update its emergency 
disaster preparedness plan. The city's disaster response handbook is almost 
complete and will be mailed to residents by January, he said. FRANK MANNING

 FOUNTAIN VALLEY / Students Turn On to New Computers 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Five Fountain Valley schools join computer project.  
</P>
<P>
 Background: Last year, the schools received a $68,000 grant from the state 
Department of Education to buy new computer equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: When classes started this fall, the computers had arrived and 
students received their first lessons on how to use the equipment. The 
computers employ graphics and animation as well as sounds to bring studies 
alive for students. "Besides reading the text, they can see and hear," said 
Diane McClarin, coordinator of Project TLC, a computer project network the 
schools have joined. "It brings the meaning to life." For instance, students 
can call up an encyclopedia to gain information about a volcano. They can 
actually see the volcano erupt on the screen. They can also perform electronic 
research, read along with children's stories that have sound and animation as 
well as create their own stories. They can also look up information in an 
atlas. Said Linda Anderson, a fourth-grade teacher at Urbain H. Plavan 
Elementary School: "It's preparing these kids for what's out there in the 
world. They have to be computer literate when they're ready to compete in the 
employment world." ALISO VIEJO / Ice-Skating Rink Draws Local Youths 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Opening of South Orange County's first ice-skating rink. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Local investors announced plans in the summer to open the Ice 
Palace in a local light industrial park. Hundreds of children swamped the site 
to sign up for hockey leagues and figure-skating lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 Development: The Ice Palace opened earlier this fall and has become a hang-out 
for teens in the South County. The rink offers hockey leagues, "mommy and me" 
skating lessons and special skating events. It's at 9 Journey in Aliso Viejo. 
SEAL BEACH / Pet Licensing Drive Takes in $11,000 
</P>
<P>
 Issue: Door-to-door dog and cat licensing. 
</P>
<P>
 Background: Some residents complained that representatives of a company 
designed to canvass the entire city in search of unlicensed dogs and cats were 
being too heavy-handed in their approach. One resident said after a 
representative of the Southeast Area Animal Control Authority knocked on her 
door and discovered her unlicensed cat, she received two notices within three 
weeks threatening court action.  
</P>
<P>
 Development: After the completion of the citywide pet licensing drive, City 
Manager Jerry L. Bankston reports that $11,000 in revenue was generated, 
slightly more than the $8,700 cost of the project. But Bankston says there will 
be increased revenue in the future from license renewals. There were a total of 
10 complaints, all from cat owners.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; LAKE RENOVATIONS NEAR COMPLETION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK MANNING 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Renovations are nearly complete at Lake Calabasas, a private lake in the city 
of Calabasas, according to Myra Turek, corresponding secretary of Calabasas 
Park Homeowners Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are 99% done," she said last week."I think it's wonderful. People are 
thrilled when they see how good it looks." 
</P>
<P>
 The renovations to the 21-acre lake included shoring up retaining walls, she 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "The lake is approximately 25 years old, and after 25 years there is some 
erosion," Turek said. "It was made from dirt and concrete. They replaced that 
with a concrete tinted to look natural. It looks the same, but it's stronger." 
</P>
<P>
 The renovations, which cost about $500,000, also involved widening sidewalks 
around the lake, which is about two miles around, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funds for the renovations came from a legal settlement with a developer, 
Baldwin Companies-Village Properties, to offset the impact of a proposed 
550-home subdivision at the end of Parkway Calabasas, said Allan Cooper, a past 
president of the homeowners association. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter, Calabasas Mayor Karyn Foley said she has heard that 
someone has offered to adopt 20 of the geese living at the lake. She said she 
had no further details but planned to look into the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The lake has become home to a large number of geese in recent years, prompting 
fears that the birds are polluting the lake with droppings. Some residents 
complain that the geese are also becoming overly aggressive and have even been 
attacking people, although there have been no reported injuries. FRANK MANNING

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: RESEDA; HUMANITAS PROGRAM GROWS TO 11TH GRADE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The 10th-graders at Reseda High currently enrolled in Humanitas, an 
inter-disciplinary learning program the school adopted this year, will be able 
to continue with the program in the 11th grade, said coordinator Elsie 
Ritchie-Mano. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, a core group of 27 sophomores have taken the theme, "Making the 
Most of Me," and used it as to unify their studies in studio art, art history, 
biological science and English. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids really get turned on when they see a link in what they are studying," 
said Ritchie-Mano. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year, the same group will study American literature and U.S. history 
using the same approach, while still meeting the state requirements for the 
11th-grade curriculum, Ritchie-Mano said. A new batch of 10th-graders will be 
recruited to the Humanitas program. 
</P>
<P>
 Schools throughout the Los Angeles Unified School District have been 
developing their own Humanitas programs designed to suit their learning 
environments. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; ATTENDANCE PROVES STUDENTS ENJOY SCHOOL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The kids at Darby Avenue Elementary love to go to school. Really. 
</P>
<P>
 They actually ask their teachers if they can come to school on Saturdays. They 
enthusiastically volunteer to pick up trash that's scattered about campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The proof of their enthusiasm is in the attendance records. 
</P>
<P>
 "The superintendent (of the Los Angeles Unified School District) wants us to 
have the goal of 95% attendance," said Principal Sidney Yukelson on Friday when 
he announced Darby's latest attendance records. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're one of three schools that has met that goal." 
</P>
<P>
 By having students participate in group projects with their classmates, 
sponsoring special event days and promoting school spirit, Darby has increased 
attendance, and also Darby's funding level. Schools are allotted about $17 per 
student for every day they are in school, or absent due to illness. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the kids are here more, they have to learn more," Yukelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth-graders in Dan Kunisaki's class just completed a unit on Native 
Americans during which youngsters were divided into groups and assigned a tribe 
to research and report on. 
</P>
<P>
 Kunisaki said "some kids wanted to stay after school and come on weekends" 
when they were building dioramas of their tribes' villages. They are having so 
much fun, he said, that it doesn't seem like schoolwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten-year-old Nicholas Wilson said he especially enjoyed making models of a 
temple and pyramids from wood, clay and sand while the class studied Native 
Americans of the Mississippi. 
</P>
<P>
 "You talk with everyone and you make new friends," Nicholas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Yukelson sponsors a campus beautification program in which student volunteers 
wear fluorescent orange Caltrans worker vests and pick up trash during recess 
and lunch with mechanical litter pickers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just pick up the trash and ask other people to pick it up," said Ashley 
Mintz, 8, as she scampered around the playground in search of garbage. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharing pride in the school, Yukelson will frequently stop a group of students 
on their way back to class and ask, "What's the best school in the universe?" 
And they always reply, gleefully and in unison, "Darby!" MAKI BECKER

 Unless there's an explosion in the local economy, Garden Grove's job market 
isn't expected to grow very much in the next 25 years, according to a county 
report. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials expect about 80 new jobs to be created yearly in the city.

the city should have about 50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirroring a statewide trend, most of these new jobs will be in the service 
industry, such as in lodging and food service, officials said.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HOLLYWOOD; TEACHER CHARGED OVER NUDE PHOTOS

<TEXT>
<P>
 A former North Hollywood special education teacher was charged with child 
annoying and contributing to the delinquency of a minor Monday after she 
allegedly lured a 7-year-old girl into a nude photo session, said the Los 
Angeles city attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy Adele Covalt, 58, admitted to police she had taken pictures of the girl in 
various stages of undress and had had the girl take pictures of her, said 
Deputy City Atty.Deborah Sanchez, who is prosecuting the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Covalt and the girl never appeared in the same frame in any of the 22 
pictures, Covalt made the child take pictures of her topless in an adult 
diaper, a thong bikini and completely nude, Sanchez said. Covalt also took 
pictures of the girl in the nude, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was visiting a relative in Covalt's Los Feliz neighborhood when the 
alleged photo session occurred in August, Sanchez said. "The child went over to 
(Covalt's) house by herself," said Sanchez. "She had known her since she was a 
small child." 
</P>
<P>
 Covalt was a teacher in the Los Angeles Unified School District and was 
working up until Friday as a substitute at Van Ness Elementary School in Los 
Angeles. When the alleged photo session occurred, place, Covalt was employed by 
Lomen Special Education Center in North Hollywood, said Sanchez. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were alerted to the pictures after the film was taken to a Thrifty's to 
be developed and a film processor reported the nude photographs, Sanchez said. 
</P>
<P>
 Covalt was not arrested and will be booked after she is arraigned Jan. 4 in 
Los Angeles Municipal Court, Sanchez said. Police said they found additional 
evidence in Covalt's home during their investigation. Covalt could be sentenced 
to up to one year in jail and a $1,000 fine. JEANNETTE REGALADO

<P>
 Graduates of Hope In Youth's parenting empowerment class will be honored at a 
7 p.m. ceremony today at Holy Rosary Church, 7800 Vineland Ave., Sun Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 The ceremony will feature the personal stories of three of the 18 graduating 
parents who will describe their experiences and the ways Hope In Youth helped 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope In Youth is a Los Angeles-based gang prevention program geared toward 
at-risk youths and their parents. Some of the programs are designed by the 
young people themselves. The organization, which is about a year old, is an 
outgrowth of several Catholic charities linked with other charitable 
organizations and religious denominations. 
</P>
<P>
 The organization's parenting classes are designed to improve communication 
skills, encourage parents to take more active roles in the children's lives and 
boost self-confidence. The goal is to ultimately make schools and neighborhoods 
safer by developing stronger family relationships and teaching parents and 
children how to participate in government and community affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 About 2,100 parents have graduated from the 12-week program in the Los Angeles 
area.

<P>
 Los Angeles police detectives nabbed a murder suspect after they spotted him 
using a pay phone near the Van Nuys Police Station, a detective said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Merdice Minifield, 28, of Los Angeles was arrested on suspicion of murder in 
the Oct. 20 killing of Johnny Freeman Jr., 26, of Panorama City, who was shot 
to death in an alley near the 14300 block of Roscoe Boulevard, Detective 
Stephen Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Minifield was arrested last Thursday. "Detectives saw him on the phone, they 
recognized him and they arrested him," Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe Minifield was one of two men seen walking with Freeman toward a 
parked car in the alley. Minifield allegedly shot Freeman several times and 
then fled in the car with the other man, Fisk said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fisk said the motive for the killing was probably revenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "These two people (Minifield and Freeman) didn't have a dispute, but there had 
been a dispute between Minifield and some of the people that (Freeman) had 
associated with," said Fisk. JULIE TAMAKI

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: LANDFILL HEARING VEERS OFF ROAD ISSUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By L.D. STRAUB 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In what many Granada Hills residents considered a last stand against the 
expansion of the Sunshine Canyon Landfill, opponents and operators of the 
facility squared off Monday afternoon as zoning officials considered whether to 
allow garbage trucks to use a city road leading to the hotly debated landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a constantly beeping egg-timer used to limit testimony to four 
minutes, the hearing dragged on for three hours as resident after resident gave 
impassioned speeches arguing against permitting the dump's operator, 
Browning-Ferris Industries, to use and widen the city road. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was eventually called to an indecisive end by associate zoning 
administrator Daniel Green. The Office of Zoning Administration will continue 
to accept written testimony for the next 10 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Cellular phones rang and babies cried as residents of the surrounding areas 
and environmental activists offered testimony against the Sunshine Canyon 
Landfill, landfills in general, and the integrity of BFI. Very little argument 
was made against the use of the road itself. About 65 people attended the 
hearing at the Sherman Oaks Woman's Club. 
</P>
<P>
 The portion of Sunshine Canyon Landfill that lies within city boundaries has 
been closed since 1991. However, BFI received approval last November to begin a 
17-million-ton expansion into county territory. The original dump, which had 
been in operation since 1958, straddles the boundary between city and county 
land. 
</P>
<P>
 The road, which runs past the now-closed city portion of the dump, offers 
access to the new and approved county dump from the Golden State Freeway. BFI 
seeks use of the road to haul trash to the dump on county land, as well as to 
continue their ongoing closure and post-closure activities of the landfill on 
city land. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposal, the road would be widened to 80 feet and eventually 
realigned, or straightened out. Arnie Berghoff, BFI spokesman, said the company 
is prepared to take all necessary measures to control any ground water 
contamination that could occur if the landfill is disturbed during grading for 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Funk, an attorney representing BFI, read from an 18-page transcript, 
alleging that opponents to the proposal were clouding the road issue by raising 
environmental issues that have already been dealt with. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Waade, of the Coalition for Clean Air, one of the few to address the 
narrow issue of the road, said it increased truck traffic into the dump would 
increase air pollution. She cited a report published by the California Air 
Resources Board which identifies diesel exhaust as a carcinogen and says that 
60% of all air pollution results from diesel emissions. Diesels would probably 
constitute most or all of BFI's traffic on the road. L.D. STRAUB

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SHERMAN OAKS; COFFEEHOUSE OWNERS' TRIAL POSTPONED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Van Nuys Municipal Court official on Monday granted a delay in the trial of 
the owners of a Sherman Oaks coffeehouse who were accused of disobeying a City 
Council order. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioner Rebecca Omens put off the trial of Third Life Inc., which 
operates the Insomnia Cafe; company president Michael Pulwer, and secretary 
John Dunn until Dec. 6, at the request of defense attorneys Robert Sheahen and 
Stanley Stone, according to Deputy City Atty.Don Cocek.  
</P>
<P>
 Cocek said Sheahen is working in a murder trial and Stone is scheduled to 
begin a trial in Kansas City on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, 1993, a city zoning administrator ruled that the cafe, at 13718 
Ventura Blvd., is a public nuisance after nearby residents complained that it 
was causing late-night noise and parking congestion and drawing unruly 
customers.  
</P>
<P>
 The city Board of Zoning Appeals upheld the ruling and ordered the cafe's 
owners to limit business hours. The Los Angeles City Council also upheld the 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 The Insomnia Cafe was ordered to close at 11 p.m. Sundays through Thursdays 
and by 1 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. 
</P>
<P>
 But according to the city, the cafe operators have violated the order on at 
least two occasions since the Dec. 1 deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted, Pulwer and Dunn each face a maximum sentence of six months in 
jail and a $1,000 fine for each violation. 
</P>
<P>
 Cocek said he was disappointed that the trial was delayed again. Discussions 
about a possible plea bargain have been unsuccessful, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't been able to reach an agreement on that," he said. "We might. You 
never know till you see the whites of the jury's eyes." KAY HWANGBO

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 2 FIREFIGHTERS FILE DEFAMATION SUIT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two firefighters implicated as arson suspects in last year's Calabasas-Malibu 
fire filed a lawsuit Monday charging Los Angeles County and Sheriff Sherman 
Block with defaming them and violating their civil rights, according to their 
attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholas A. Durepo and Steven R. Shelp filed the suit in Los Angeles Superior 
Court, asking for unspecified damages, said Larry R. Feldman, who is 
representing both men. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit was expected. It is a follow-up to administrative claims against 
Block and the county that the two men filed in September, to no effect. The law 
requires that such claims be filed prior to a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Feldman contends that both men were innocent victims of Sheriff Block, who was 
motivated, he said, by reelection concerns when he disclosed on national TV 
that Durepo and Shelp were suspected of setting the fires. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after the Los Angeles County district attorney's office said last July 
that there was insufficient evidence to prosecute Shelp and Durepo, Block 
continued to harm the men's reputations by refusing to admit he was wrong, 
Feldman said. 
</P>
<P>
 A county grand jury declined to indict the two firefighters last summer after 
weeks of testimony, including hearing from a contractor who corroborated 
Shelp's and Durepo's version of events. 
</P>
<P>
 Durepo, 24, and Shelp, 29, say they were driving along Old Topanga Canyon Road 
in Calabasas, off duty, when the fire began last November, and they tried to 
put it out with equipment they had in their car. 
</P>
<P>
 News photographers, who arrived at the site where the blaze began, filmed them 
hosing down a burn victim as they tried to put out the first flames that went 
on to consume thousands of acres between Topanga Canyon and Malibu. The 
contractor told the grand jury that he provided the men with a special adapter 
they needed to connect their water hose to a hydrant to fight the fire.  
</P>
<P>
 Shelp, of the San Fernando Valley, was recently hired by the Los Angeles Fire 
Department but was confined to desk duty as a result of Block's disclosures, 
the lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 Durepo, from the South Bay area, was working as a part-time reservist for the 
Manhattan Beach and Culver City fire departments. He was terminated by both 
departments. JEANNETTE REGALADO

JURY URGES DEATH PENALTY FOR KILLER OF MAYWOOD OFFICER; COURTS: EDGARDO SANCHEZ 
FUENTES, 23, WILL BE SENTENCED DEC. 16. NO DECISION WAS REACHED ON THE FATES OF 
HIS TWO COMPANIONS WHO JOINED IN 1992 CRIME SPREE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles Superior Court jury Monday recommended the death penalty for 
Edgardo Sanchez Fuentes, the convicted triggerman in the fatal shootings of a 
Maywood police officer and a Van Nuys grocer during a 1992 crime spree. 
</P>
<P>
 But the same jury reached no decision on the fates of Sanchez's companions, 
Benjamin Alberto Navarro and Jose Contreras, who also were convicted of the 
murders and a number of armed robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the three young men showed much reaction Monday as the verdicts were 
read. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez, 23, is scheduled to be sentenced Dec. 16 and it is still possible 
that Superior Court Judge Jacqueline A. Connor will reject the jury's 
recommendation and sentence him instead to life in prison without parole. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanchez's lawyer, Public Defender Jim Coady, said Sanchez had been willing to 
plead guilty in exchange for a life sentence but prosecutors rejected the offer 
because the victims included John Hoglund, 46, the first Maywood police officer 
ever killed in the line of duty. Hoglund was shot as he checked out a grocery 
store where a burglar alarm had gone off. 
</P>
<P>
 Also killed during the trio's string of holdups was Lee Chul Kim, 49, who ran 
the Woodley Market in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Navarro, 24, and Contreras, 22, are to appear in court Jan. 20 for a hearing 
on whether the penalty phase of their cases should be re-tried before a new 
jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael Grosbard said he and his colleague Susan Speer 
would consult their supervisors before deciding whether to begin the process 
anew. The jury voted 10 to 2 for a life sentence for Navarro, and 8 to 4 for 
life for Contreras, indicating the majority believed neither man deserved 
death. 
</P>
<P>
 Heartened by those votes, defense lawyers expressed confidence that the case 
was essentially over and their clients' lives would be spared. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to re-try it," said Richard Leonard, one of Contreras' 
attorneys. "They've already given it their best shot." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to humanize Contreras for the jury, Leonard's brother and law 
partner, James Leonard, traveled with a cultural anthropologist to Honduras to 
learn what he could about Contreras' life in his native village. 
</P>
<P>
 He left school at age 8 to help support five brothers and sisters after their 
father abandoned them, James Leonard said. The youth was so well-remembered 
that 70 townspeople walked for miles in extreme heat to be interviewed by 
Leonard and Prof. Michael Winkelman of Arizona State University, who told the 
jury of their experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that was some very powerful testimony," Leonard said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Contreras had no discernible criminal record in his native country, 
Navarro and Sanchez did, said Grosbard. Navarro, of El Salvador, had a history 
of stealing, and Sanchez, from Honduras, was sent to a reform school there, 
Grosbard said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor said the fact that the three men entered this country illegally 
played no role in their conviction. But Coady disagreed, saying, "This is a 
very bad time to deal with a case like this. We questioned the jurors and many 
had very strong feelings about it."

SETTLEMENT REACHED IN NEPTUNE SOCIETY SUIT; LEGAL: SOURCES SAY WIDOW OF FORMER 
BURBANK MAYOR WILL RECEIVE ALMOST $1 MILLION AFTER HER HUSBAND'S REMAINS WERE 
MISHANDLED AND HIS CREMATION DELAYED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 It took more than four months to get the body of former Burbank mayor Dallas 
Williams cremated, and it took 2 1/2 years for his widow to settle a lawsuit 
against the people she accused of mishandling his remains. 
</P>
<P>
 But settle Gaye Williams finally did, reaching an agreement in Los Angeles 
Superior Court on Monday under which the Neptune Society, the firm that 
cremated her husband's body, will pay her nearly $1 million, said sources close 
to the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for both sides in the civil suit would not confirm the amount, saying 
it was to remain confidential under the terms of their agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, the main purpose of the suit, Williams said, was to force the Neptune 
Society to change its procedures and avoid the kinds of mistakes that had 
caused her so much heartache. 
</P>
<P>
 "What was essential to me was their statement," Williams said Monday. "None of 
this would've happened if they had any kind of human feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Dallas Williams, a well-known Los Angeles advertising man and creator of the 
Culligan Man, died of cancer June 3, 1991, and had arranged to be cremated 
through the Neptune Society, which picks up bodies, stores them, and arranges 
for their disposal. 
</P>
<P>
 But 4 1/2 months after his death and supposed cremation, a Neptune agent 
visited his widow at 9:30 at night and asked her to identify a graphic photo of 
a decaying corpse -- her husband's -- which had been found in a refrigerated 
compartment in Gardena, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ashes she had received earlier were those of someone else, she said she 
was told. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was just starting to feel right again," Williams said, "and this shoved me 
right back." 
</P>
<P>
 She was so angry over the mistake and more importantly to her, how it was 
handled, that she sued the Neptune Society in October, 1992. The Neptune 
Society, in turn, sued North American Crematory in Santa Ana, saying it was the 
subcontractor's fault for confusing the two bodies and forgetting about the 
body of Dallas Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 She finally arranged to have her husband cremated and his ashes scattered over 
Puget Sound, Wash., she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under an out-of-court settlement agreement approved Monday by Superior Court 
Judge Richard Hubbell, the Neptune Society of Los Angeles will pay Williams an 
undisclosed sum and issue news releases pledging new procedures and no future 
mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Society's owner and president, Manny Weintraub, could not be reached for 
comment Monday. His attorney, Jeffrey Zinder, said the changed procedures have 
already been put into effect. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Williams and the Neptune Society are to evenly split a financial 
reward from the North American Crematory -- but only if the crematory succeeds 
in suing its insurance company for lack of coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "North American denied any liability whatsoever in this case," said lawyer 
Steven Serratore.

6 UNDOCUMENTED WORKERS ARRESTED AT VALLEY SITES; CONTRACTORS: A JOINT TASK 
FORCE MADE UP OF FEDERAL AND STATE AGENCY REPRESENTATIVES TARGETS BUILDERS WHO 
HIRE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Six undocumented workers have been arrested in the San Fernando Valley by a 
new task force that targets contractors who hire illegal immigrants, officials 
said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The joint program involves the federal Immigration and Naturalization Service 
and the Contractor's State License Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we've task forced with them (the CSLB) to pursue 
information of this kind," said John Brechtel, director of investigations for 
the INS. "They have an expertise in the construction industry that we don't 
have." 
</P>
<P>
 Illegal hiring practices among contractors have been a growing problem in the 
past few years, according to officials from both agencies. 
</P>
<P>
 On two occasions, INS agents have accompanied board investigators to areas in 
which the board conducted sweeps in search of unlicensed contractors working on 
quake-damaged homes. Brechtel said the agency would move to deport those 
arrested unless they proved that they had previously applied for asylum. 
</P>
<P>
 Brechtel said his agency also might choose not to deport undocumented workers 
if they are of long standing in the community, have no criminal record and have 
others in their family who are citizens. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the new program is designed to target employers who hire undocumented 
workers, no citations or arrests of employers have been made. The new task 
force is in its infancy and is still conducting investigations, Brechtel said. 
</P>
<P>
 The INS has conducted similar programs with state occupational safety 
officials and wage and hour regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 Employers found guilty of illegal hiring practices under the Immigration and 
Reform Act face fines as high as $10,000 per violation and possible prison 
sentences for repeat offenders. 
</P>
<P>
 While the INS and the Contractor's License Board plan future actions together, 
the board made its first weekend investigative sweep against unlicensed 
contractors this weekend, said the board's Sam Haynes. Stopping at 76 sites, 
they arrested 17 people for illegally contracting without a license and 
ticketed 14 licensed contractors for other violations, including failure to 
hold workers' compensation policies for their employees. 
</P>
<P>
 From April to May of this year, board investigators have arrested 368 
unlicensed contractors and cited 330 licensees. 
</P>
<P>
 Quake recovery money in the billions has attracted fraudulent contractors to 
the area, said Ralph Hollier of the Contractor's Board. He warned homeowners to 
be sure they hire contractors with current licenses, which can be checked by 
calling (800) 321-CSLB.

VALLEY INTERVIEW; DELGADILLO LEADS THE CITY'S EFFORT TO TREAT BUSINESS LIKE A 
CLIENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HUGO MARTIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the past three months, the San Fernando Valley lost a major employer when 
Packard Bell was wooed to Sacramento but retained the Anheuser-Busch Co., which 
decided to stay in the Valley and launch a $175-million expansion program at 
its Van Nuys brewery. 
</P>
<P>
 In both cases, representatives from the city of Los Angeles met with the 
business owners, offering to help cut through the city's red tape if they 
agreed to stay put. Mayor Richard Riordan has promised to do more than previous 
mayors to retain and attract more businesses to the city. To that end, he 
persuaded the City Council in September to spend $1.9 million to establish a 
business-retention team and hire at least a dozen people to staff it. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseeing the effort is Assistant Deputy Mayor Rocky Delgadillo. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What is the mayor doing to keep businesses in the city?  
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Our efforts are, first, to get out and talk to those people that are 
creating jobs, that are expanding, that are actually growing. Packard Bell 
happened to be one of those companies, and Anheuser-Busch happens to be one of 
those companies. In fact, Anheuser-Busch is going to modernize their plant. 
They are actually not going to add a big number of new jobs. Because they were 
downsizing, that allows them to hire more people in other areas and increase 
productivity. 
</P>
<P>
 What we did was help them through the permitting process, and that was 
basically our influence on them. Also, we let them know that the mayor was a 
friend and was happy to help create jobs in the city of Los Angeles. We also 
worked with them in connection with the Department of Water and Power. They 
have a water and power issue. They use a lot of it. DWP came forward with 
something that was attractive to Anheuser-Busch to keep them in the city. They 
were the second-largest power user in the city, I think. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Had Anheuser-Busch looked elsewhere?  
</P>
<P>
 A: They had looked elsewhere in the Southland. They had looked elsewhere out 
of the state. They had talked about going to Arizona to build a plant on the 
border and basically shipping in their product here, because this is one of 
their largest markets. 
</P>
<P>
 But we convinced them to do a couple of things. One was not to move. Second, 
they were considering a co-generation plant to create their own power, which 
would mean the DWP would have lost one of their biggest clients. We convinced 
them not to do that. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Can't the city offer tax breaks to keep business in the city?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Sure, we can offer tax breaks in certain areas of the city. There are 
certain zones where you get certain tax breaks from the state and the federal 
government. The council is currently studying a proposal to limit the 
gross-receipts tax in certain areas of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Did the city offer any tax breaks to Anheuser-Busch?  
</P>
<P>
 A: No. I think they are in a revitalization zone that was established after 
the civil disturbances of 1992 so they got some state tax benefits for 
rebuilding and modernizing their plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But didn't they already know about that and take advantage of it?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Actually, they didn't know about that until we mentioned it to them. 
Typically big companies don't think about those kinds of things. A lot of 
companies don't think about government programs. They just don't think about 
government, frankly. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about Packard Bell? Why didn't the city do more to keep it here?  
</P>
<P>
 A: I think we made an admirable effort to keep them in the city of Los 
Angeles. There were a whole lot of things that happened, one of which was very 
big: the earthquake. The quake happened in the middle of our discussions with 
them. The roofs on three of their buildings in Chatsworth caved in. So they had 
to move. 
</P>
<P>
 During all this time we continued our discussions about keeping them in the 
city. Of course, Chatsworth was no longer an option because the buildings were 
destroyed. We talked to them about the General Motors plant in Van Nuys, and we 
had very serious discussion about that plant. What we offered them we probably 
would not offer to many others, so I wouldn't be inclined to tell you what it 
was but it was very, very significant benefits for staying in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If it hadn't been for the earthquake, do you think you could have kept them 
in Los Angeles?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah. I think it was sort of a timing issue. I think if you evaluate what 
we offered compared to what they got from Sacramento, what we offered was much 
more significant. I think part of it was also the labor costs associated with 
living in the city of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What will the business retention team do?  
</P>
<P>
 A: The team is going to go out to those businesses in the city of Los Angeles 
that are growing. Remember, we have about 300,000 businesses in the region and 
12 people are not going to get to all 300,000 businesses. So we are going to 
use a database to pick out the businesses that are growing and help them grow 
even faster. We want all these companies to be the stars of the future, the 
"Fortune 1000s" of the future. People will go out and talk to businesses and 
say, "How can we help?" They may say, "Well, you can help by getting out of my 
way." And we'll say, "OK. Here is my card. Call me if you need me." 
</P>
<P>
 They may say, "I'm doing an expansion, and I need to hire another 100 people, 
and I need another 50,000 square feet, but I'm concerned about the permitting 
process in the city." We'll say, "Let me help you get through that process." 
That is one of the biggest things we can offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you think are the biggest hurdles that you have to overcome to keep 
businesses in Los Angeles?  
</P>
<P>
 A: As far as I can tell, it's the perception about the city of Los Angeles 
generally, and that includes the perception about the quality of life here. I 
think we are impacting that issue. We are going to do a new Los Angeles 
marketing partnership which will try to change the perception of the city of 
Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a marketing campaign. You can compare it to the "I Love New York" 
campaign of a few years back. We will be telling the stories of some of these 
successful companies that are here that people don't know about. We will talk 
about the fact that the economy is growing in a variety of industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Businesses are always concerned about excessive regulations. Is there 
anything that the city can do about cutting the regulations?  
</P>
<P>
 A: Yeah. We have the Development Reform Committee, which is being headed up by 
Dan Garcia, and a report from them is imminent. They are probably going to make 
a number of recommendations on how to expedite the permitting process. 
Implementation of that will occur over a long period of time. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the small Mom-and-Pop business? How do they fit into this?  
</P>
<P>
 A: When I talk about fast-growing companies, I'm not talking about 1,000 jobs. 
I'm talking basically about businesses with 20 to 100 jobs. Those are the 
fastest-growing companies. There are a whole slew of them. We are going to 
focus on some small-sized companies because some of those have really great 
growth potential. 
</P>
<P>
 When I think of Mom-and-Pop businesses, I think of the corner sandwich shop or 
corner Laundromat. With economic development, if you create those 
wealth-creating jobs, they tend to have a multiplier effect. For example, the 
Hughes missile site out in the Valley is vacant because they moved to Tucson. 
We are helping to move Coast Savings to that site. There is a sandwich shop on 
the corner that has suffered since Hughes moved out. They are ecstatic about 
the fact that Coast is going to move in and bring 1,000 people to buy more 
sandwiches. So that is the kind of ripple effect that will assist the small 
Mom-and-Pop businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What do you promote as the benefits of staying in Los Angeles?  
</P>
<P>
 A: You have some of the most intelligent, innovative people in the world in 
Los Angeles. You have access to some of the largest and fastest-growing markets 
in the world. You also have access to the whole Pacific Rim from Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The infrastructure here is good and getting better. We have some of the 
greatest universities that are willing to participate in this whole recovery 
process. Most of the banking industries are here. You have investment bankers. 
You have the lawyers. You have all the people that facilitate the growth of an 
economy here.

COLLEGE DISTRICT APPROVES FACULTY RETIREMENT PLAN; EDUCATION: INCENTIVES ARE 
AIMED AT TENURED INSTRUCTORS AGE 55 AND OVER. THE PURPOSE IS TO SAVE MONEY, 
DIVERSIFY STAFF. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a move aimed at revitalizing academic programs and saving money, trustees 
of the Los Angeles Community College District voted Monday to offer faculty 
members an early-retirement package that could produce one of the district's 
largest shake-ups in years. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan adopted by a 5-0 vote, nearly half of the district's 1,683 
tenured faculty members -- those 55 or older -- would be eligible for 
early-retirement incentives. District officials said up to 300 teachers, about 
18% of the total, might accept the offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine-campus, 101,000-student district has suffered financially in recent 
years in part because of declining enrollment. The district also has an usually 
large proportion of older faculty members because of the growth that occurred 
in the 1960s and early 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials expect to save money under the plan. The cost of providing 
the retirement bonus to departing faculty members would be more than offset by 
the salary savings from replacing veteran, top-pay-scale instructors with 
younger, lower-paid teachers. 
</P>
<P>
 Another goal is to diversify the ethnic makeup of the full-time faculty, which 
is about 70% white although the district's students are 75% minority. And 
district officials hope the new faculty will permit the district to update and 
reorder its class offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the retirement proposal, however, won't be known for some 
months. District teachers have one period to apply this fall and another period 
that will close near the end of the spring semester. The district has set a 
minimum of 150 retirement applications in order to put the program into 
practice. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said 43% of the district's full-time, tenured instructors 
-- 719 of 1,683 -- are 55 or older and thus eligible for the incentive. At 
present, a top-scale faculty member without a doctorate earns an annual salary 
of about $50,550. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan, faculty members taking early retirement would be paid an extra 
7% of their final basic salary annually in a lifetime annuity. For an 
instructor age 60 with 30 years of experience, that would add about $3,500 a 
year to an annual pension of about $30,330. 
</P>
<P>
 Part of the district's savings would come from a provision that requires the 
replacement of only 75% of the retiring full-time faculty within an 18-month 
period. The other 25% of the positions could remain vacant or be partially or 
entirely filled with less expensive part-time instructors. 
</P>
<P>
 The district could save about $20 million over 10 years, most of that in years 
five through 10, if 165 teachers retired and the district replaced only about 
12.5% with part-timers and left the same percentage of positions vacant, said 
Robert Standen, vice chancellor for human resources. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the campuses, according to district records, Harbor College in 
Wilmington has the largest share of faculty -- 49% -- that are 55 or older. 
Close behind are Valley College in Van Nuys (48%) and Pierce College in 
Woodland Hills (46%). 
</P>
<P>
 In terms of absolute numbers, Pierce and Valley colleges, among the district's 
largest campuses in enrollment, have the greatest number of faculty eligible 
for the incentive, 127 of 279 at Pierce and 114 of 236 at Valley, according to 
district records. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission College in Sylmar, the district's youngest campus, founded in 1975, 
has the smallest share (33%) of faculty eligible for the early retirement, 28 
of 85 instructors. West Los Angeles College also has a younger group, with only 
37%, or 49 of its 134 instructors, eligible.

PROBE OF RACISM CLAIM DROPPED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Anti-Defamation League has dropped its investigation into an actress's 
claim of racism on the set of "E.R.," the popular NBC medical drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, the civil rights organization said it was conducting an inquiry 
into actress Thea Perkins' accusation that actor George Clooney had made a 
derogatory racial remark on the set. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall Steinberg, regional assistant director of the ADL, a division of B'Nai 
Brith, said he interviewed 17 people, some of whom would have been eyewitnesses 
to such an incident and some of whom were character witnesses.  
</P>
<P>
 Warner Bros., which produces "E.R.," investigated the charges last week and 
found them groundless, said spokeswoman Barbara Brogliatti. 
</P>
<P>
 Clooney had no comment. Perkins, a 27-year-old actress from Chicago, had a job 
as an extra on the set of "E.R." She said she walked out after hearing Clooney 
make a remark about the Ku Klux Klan to actor Deezer D., an African American 
who plays an orderly.  
</P>
<P>
 But Deezer D. said that he, not Clooney, briefly mentioned the KKK: After 
Clooney put a yellow burn mask on his head, Deezer D. joked that he looked like 
a Klansman. Clooney, Deezer D. said, never responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg said that the witnesses he interviewed confirmed Deezer D.'s 
account. He said the ADL had never supported Perkins in her claim, but had 
merely agreed to investigate it.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; GIRL KILLED, 1 SERIOUSLY HURT IN COLLISION 
</P>

 Two cars that collided on the Antelope Valley Freeway hurtled down an 
embankment Monday and one landed atop the other, killing a 16-year-old driver 
and trapping her 16-year-old passenger in the lower car, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The cars ended up on top of each other, upside down," said Capt. Tom Costello 
of the Los Angeles County Fire Department, who rescued the girl from the bottom 
car. "I had never seen anything like it." 
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey Wood, 16, of Palmdale, who was thrown 40 feet from the car she was 
driving in the 10:30 a.m. accident, died as she was being airlifted to a 
hospital, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 A Palmdale girl in the passenger seat, who authorities did not identify, was 
in serious condition at Northridge Hospital Medical Center Monday night, a 
nursing supervisor said. Both were students at Highland High School in 
Palmdale. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the other car, Maria Villanueva, 22, of Palmdale, and her 
3-year-old daughter, Jessica Del Refugio, were not seriously injured and were 
treated and released from Antelope Valley Hospital, said Officer Miguel Siordia 
of the California Highway Patrol. 
</P>
<P>
 Villanueva was wearing a seat belt and the child was in a car seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Costello said that when he arrived at the scene, the trapped girl was 
screaming for help. 
</P>
<P>
 "I crawled into the car and pulled the girl out," said Costello. "The car had 
caught fire but some passersby put it out right away with their (car) fire 
extinguishers." 
</P>
<P>
 Costello said the driver was not wearing a seat belt, but her passenger was. 
</P>
<P>
 A small crowd gathered at the site where the autos ended up in a vacant lot 
behind a newly built K mart in the 39600 block of 10th Street West near Avenue 
P, and tried to calm the victims until paramedics arrived, said Costello. 
</P>
<P>
 The girls and Villanueva were both headed north on the Antelope Valley Freeway 
when the teen-ager's car veered into Villanueva's lane and both cars went out 
of control, Siordia said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was amazing (Villanueva and her daughter) got out of it as well as they 
did," said Costello. The mother and her child were able to climb out of their 
car.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; COUNTY RESIDENTS PETITION FOR ANNEXATION TO 
SANTA CLARITA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUGLAS ALGER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some 920 Los Angeles County residents north of the Saugus community have 
petitioned the Santa Clarita City Council to have their area become part of the 
city of Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers of the effort collected signatures showing about 61% of the 1,500 
households in the neighborhood -- along Seco Canyon Road, north of Copper Hill 
Drive -- favor annexation, enough to demonstrate community support for the 
move. 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters said annexation into Santa Clarita will provide them with better 
police and fire services and allow the residents greater input into government 
decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 It would also lower their tax bills a bit. City residents do not pay the 5% 
utility tax assessed to those in unincorporated county areas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "To become residents of the city means we would finally receive the benefits 
and services provided by Santa Clarita," said resident Louis Emmer.  
</P>
<P>
 "We really want an identity. Residents want to become a part of the community 
and we're missing out on that opportunity now." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials generally welcome annexations of adjoining areas, but they ask 
that a petition drive be held before they get involved.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to force anybody," said city public information officer Gail 
Foy. "They have to make the first move." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The formal annexation will probably take about two years, said Don Williams, 
city annexation coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next step is for (city) staff to look at the area to determine what would 
be a logical boundary for the city to extend to," Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
 The annexation request and a city review of the financial impact of the 
annexation will go before the City Council in 60 to 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by the council, the request will then be forwarded to the county 
Local Agency Formation Commission for final approval.  
</P>
<P>
 LAFCO officials have approved all 10 of Santa Clarita's annexation requests 
since 1987.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 7 GANG SUSPECTS ARRESTED IN SERIES OF 
BURGLARIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven suspected gang members who authorities say befriended other youths in 
order to burglarize their families' homes have been arrested, authorities said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The thefts occurred during a six-month period that ended earlier this month 
when one suspected gang member was arrested on suspicion of trying to cash a 
check stolen during a burglary, said Deputy Tony Miano of the Santa Clarita 
Valley Sheriff's Station. Miano said an investigation by deputies led to the 
arrest of one additional adult and five juveniles. The last of the arrests was 
made on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects have confessed to taking personal checks, weapons and other items 
from six homes, Miano said, although deputies believe they also participated in 
other unreported burglaries. He said two break-ins occurred at unoccupied 
residences, but other thefts were more devious. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were other instances where these were people the gangs befriended, 
usually other kids, and found ways into the home," he said. "In one case they 
lured one of the victim's daughters away from the house so the gang members 
could burglarize it." 
</P>
<P>
 A couple of the burglaries occurred at the homes of people related to the 
suspects, Miano added. 
</P>
<P>
 "For whatever reason there was animosity in the family and the kid decided he 
would get even by making it possible for the gang members to burglarize the 
home," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Miano did not know the total value of the stolen items, but said only a small 
portion has been recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspects are allegedly members of a multiracial gang that has operated on 
the west side of Santa Clarita for the past two years, Miano said, adding that 
the gang also has members in Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests, Miano said, may have at least temporarily put a stop to the 
gang's activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel some of the arrests have included the leadership of this gang and we 
have received information from some of the members who were not arrested that 
this gang no longer exists," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zachary Graves, 21, of Valencia, who authorities said tried to write a forged 
check at a Valencia check-cashing business on Nov. 10, was the first to be 
arrested. Deputy Dustin Stillwell discovered other stolen property and credit 
cards on Graves while arresting him, and Graves later admitted involvement in 
two burglaries, Miano said. 
</P>
<P>
 A second man, Richard Rubio, 18, of Saugus, was arrested the same day when he 
came to the sheriff's station to see what had happened to his friend, Miano 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They noticed at that time that he might be wearing stolen clothes, so they 
detained him and found evidence linking him to stolen clothes," Miano said. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men are at Men's Central Jail in Los Angeles, Miano said. 
</P>
<P>
 One juvenile who is on probation for a conviction of assault on school 
property remains in custody at Sylmar Juvenile Hall, while the other four have 
been released to their parents.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; SANTA CLARITA MAN SUSPECT IN RAPE, CHILD 
MOLESTATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 40-year-old Santa Clarita man was arrested early Monday for allegedly 
molesting a young girl and then raping a San Fernando Valley prostitute, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Bloomer was arrested on suspicion of rape and kidnap after a prostitute 
told police that he picked her up and took her to a Santa Clarita location 
where she saw him molest a girl, about 5 years old, said Detective Bill Looney 
of the sheriff's child abuse detail. 
</P>
<P>
 The prostitute told police that after he molested the young girl, Bloomer 
forced the prostitute to perform various sexual acts on him and then raped her, 
Looney said. The prostitute, whose name was not disclosed, was apparently kept 
at the location for several hours before she escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 The little girl has been placed into protective custody, Looney said.

FIXATIONS: NEW PARTS UP AND RUNNING, IRONMAN PUTS HIS MIND TO IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Everyone should have a creed. "Give me liberty or give me death" was a pretty 
good one, as was JFK's "Ask not what your country can do for you."  
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Durham also lives by a creed. "It's that you can never be too thin at 
the waist, or too broad at the shoulders or able to utilize too much oxygen," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so it's not Founding Father's stuff. It works for Durham. His measure of 
adherence to that creed is what he calls "the Terminator index." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's named for Arnold Schwarzenegger," he said. "You take your jacket 
measurement and subtract your waist measurement, and the larger the result the 
better. I've gone from a 7, which is fairly wimp-like, to a 12, which is 
respectable: a 30-inch waist and a Size 42 jacket." 
</P>
<P>
 Not many people know their resting pulse, content just to have one. Durham 
clocks his at 60 beats a minute, up from his prime of 53, but a good sight 
better than the average adult resting pulse of 72. 
</P>
<P>
 He looks a bit like a young, innocent Peter Sellers. He may not have the 
chiseled, bulked-out appearance of a mirror-worshiping bodybuilder, but he's 
got credentials. 
</P>
<P>
 A weighty iron medal hangs on a wall in his Irvine condo, a hard-won memento 
from his participation in the 1982 Ironman triathlon, the world's premier 
hard-guy contest held each year in Hawaii. He swam 2.4 miles, biked 112 miles 
and raced 26.2 miles on foot to finish 453rd in a field of 780.  
</P>
<P>
 Now 38, he's steadily gearing up to tackle the Ironman again someday. It isn't 
age that's slowing his approach to the event. Rather, it is because this 
Ironman might more aptly be called Titanium Man. Durham is the sort of guy who 
drives metal detectors nuts. 
</P>
<P>
 He used to log 20,000 miles a year on his custom-made bike, often spending a 
Saturday riding to San Diego and back. One day in 1987, while riding in 
Santiago Canyon, a car hit him, and, as he puts it, "the car won." The bike was 
totaled, and Durham was scarcely in any better shape.  
</P>
<P>
 He spent the next three years and two months hospitalized, the first eight 
weeks of that in a coma. "I was in several different hospitals, in various 
states of consciousness. I was functionally dead for a long time. My life was 
ruled by doctors. It was not a fun time, though given the alternative you 
really can't complain too much," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When he finally got out of the hospital in May of 1990, it was in a 
wheelchair, with a titanium tube where his left femur (the long bone of the 
thigh) had been. "The doctor said it wasn't even worth saving the pieces as a 
souvenir," Durham recalled of his original femur.  
</P>
<P>
 He progressed to crutches and then a cane, which he abandoned two years ago. 
His gait now is uncomfortable even to watch, yet he walks more than 40 miles a 
week, most of that to and from the gym, for which he departs at 4:30 a.m. every 
48 hours. He makes a point of swimming twice a week, even though he loathes the 
water, likening it to sensory deprivation.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Prior to his accident, Durham had already had several surgeries for bad 
shoulder joints and knees. He prefers to take a lighthearted attitude to his 
situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody has certain jobs in life, and one of mine is to keep orthopedic 
surgeons employed," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 He was born without a section of shoulder joint that keeps the arm from 
popping out, hence his did. He had his first surgery while an undergrad at 
Yale. "My right arm got so loose in its socket that I'd raise my hand in class 
and my arm would pop out. My professors thought I was being rude by not putting 
my hand down. And I couldn't! So there's piece of metal in there now that holds 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 There's a symmetrical scar on his left shoulder where he underwent surgery on 
that joint two years later, followed by microsurgeries on his knees for 
conditions worsened by his running. "You'd think I'd qualify for a quantity 
discount by now," he quipped. He is considering yet another major surgery, to 
replace his new femur, because when he attempts anew to run with it every day, 
he loses his balance. 
</P>
<P>
 His dining-room table is covered with neat piles of stuffed Manila folders, 
his files for a doctoral dissertation he expects to soon be undertaking. He 
holds an MBA from Stanford. Prior to retiring as a result of his accident, he'd 
been project manager with a general contracting firm that built a number of 
country tracts, including the one in which he lives. He's now planning a career 
jump, to marketing professor. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Is he perhaps driving to have such physical and mental control of himself to 
make up for the lack of control he had over his life following the accident? 
</P>
<P>
 "No, that's just my general nature. I'm an incredible A-type personality. I 
have this notion of showing up for my first day of class with my dissertation 
already written. I'm very driven, and I like to live life just the way I want 
to live. That has been screwed with for a while, but now it's just back on 
track. You'd have to kill me before I'd give up.  
</P>
<P>
 "And as certain friends of mine would point out, I drive myself so hard that 
-- and this is a fault of which I'm absolutely guilty -- I tend to be 
incredibly self-centered."  
</P>
<P>
 He's not the sort to hang out at the gym and gab. He used to play soccer and 
tennis, "but it's not much of an opportunity to push yourself. It's fun, but 
I'm not that big on fun. I want a workout, to get stronger and thinner," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 His lifestyle isn't heavy on fun. He rarely reads fiction. Shelves have titles 
on economics and sports medicine. He wears a 10-year-old $25 Casio sports watch 
and drives Volkswagens until they expire. "I had 330,000 miles on the one I had 
before my present one and was mad at my parents for selling it when I was in 
the hospital," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He'd ballooned from a 30-inch waist to a 38 when he was in the hospital, but 
it didn't take long to get back to his old form. This, by the way, is almost 
entirely due to his calorie-burning activities, as he hardly limits his intake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a junk-food junkie of the worst type, a connoisseur of fast-food places," 
he admits. Lunch "almost invariably" is two slices and a diet Coke at Z Pizza. 
His regimen also includes fish tacos and Parmesan sourdough burgers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though he goes the budget route in other areas, "the only consumer good I care 
about is a bicycle," he says. As soon as he's comfortable with his balance 
running, he intends to fork over about $3,500 for a state-of-the-art bike, made 
-- as is some of the leg that will power it -- of titanium. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time he did the Ironman, it took him more than 13 hours, and he says 
it's the 12-hour mark that really separates the men from the boys. He's 
convinced he can shave five minutes from his previous swim time and gain a 
half-hour on the bike course with this strength. The marathon would be his 
biggest hurdle, as it was when he had undamaged legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can swim it, and I can ride forever, but that was the only marathon I've 
ever done. The most I'd ever run is 12 miles. And in the Ironman I was tired 
from the other two events when I started running." 
</P>
<P>
 Though he can't run without toppling, he's determined he will be able to. He's 
set no timetable, but he has no doubt he'll get there. He has a similar 
confidence about his doctoral degree. He's not as secure in all areas, though. 
</P>
<P>
 "Life for me breaks down into three different games: intellectual, physical 
and the emotional. Quite frankly, there aren't many people better than me at 
the first two. There aren't many people more smart than I am or more athletic, 
but I can count the times I've been in love on two fingers.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think about that a lot. I'm not the most outgoing person in the world. I'm 
certainly missing out on a portion of life, but that's because the first two 
parts are so important to me that they take up most of my time. And as has been 
said to me by a former boss, I do not suffer fools easily." 
</P>
<P>
 Does that mean he needs someone brighter than he? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's an assumption in your question," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 That there is someone brighter? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people brighter than me for sure, but locating them isn't easy," he 
said with a laugh. In the meantime, he's still not gotten over the most recent 
of his loves, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 There is Salli, however, his black and white dog acquired from "the discount 
dog store," as Durham refers to the pound. He found Salli in with the sixth-day 
dogs, meaning she was one day away from being put to sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I'm not the best guy in the world, but given the choice between me 
and death, hey . . . " he said.  
</P>
<P>
 It is Salli who dutifully gets him up at 4:30 every morning as the newspaper 
truck goes by, and he starts his training day.  
</P>
<P>
 Why does Durham care so much about reaching an optimum? 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason behind it, except why not?" he said. "It's trying to find 
the limit. How smart can I be? How fast can I be? If you are in fact capable of 
doing more with yourself, why let it go to waste?"

A DEFIANT VOICE; CARL ROWAN HAS BEEN ACCUSED OF TRYING TO DESTROY THE NAACP. 
BUT THE COLUMNIST SAYS HE IS ONLY AFTER CHANGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM FULWOOD III, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've ever heard that soothing voice or read those scholarly sentences, 
you'd know it's him. Syndicated columnist Carl Rowan has a signature style. 
</P>
<P>
 That jowly baby face and genial manner have been fixtures among the talking 
heads on PBS' "Inside Washington" since 1965. His voice can be heard on 25 
major-market radio stations broadcasting "The Rowan Reports," a daily radio 
commentary. He has written seven books, some of them bestsellers. 
</P>
<P>
 But lately, Rowan, an elegant and polished black man of 69 years who writes 
and speaks in the terse and precise prose common among the well-educated of his 
generation, has become something of an attack journalist on a self-appointed 
mission to bring down the current leadership of the NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 His bitterly critical columns, distributed by the King Features Syndicate and 
published in 100 newspapers across the land, are the major reason the National 
Assn. for the Advancement of Colored People is facing its greatest crisis. 
NAACP Executive Director Benjamin F. Chavis was forced to resign late in the 
summer amid allegations -- first raised by Rowan -- that he used the 
organization's money to settle a sexual discrimination suit brought by a former 
employee, opening the organization's financial practices to unprecedented 
public scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan's current target is NAACP Board Chairman William Gibson, who had been 
Chavis' most ardent supporter. By repeatedly demanding that Gibson resign, 
Rowan has set himself apart from most mainstream reporters -- black or white -- 
who tend to steer clear of pointed and determined criticism of the NAACP. But 
Rowan relishes the combat of writing to incite change -- regardless, he said, 
of whether his targets are white-led government institutions, such as the FBI 
under former director J. Edgar Hoover in the 1960s, or the current NAACP 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 During a wide-ranging interview conducted recently in the living room of his 
rambling northwest Washington home, Rowan defended his hard-edged columns. He 
called them "a service," written with the intention of educating the public and 
instigating reforms within an organization he views as necessary to the 
interests of African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan rejected the argument that he is bent on destroying the NAACP. In fact, 
he says, the organization absolutely has a role in the post-civil rights 
generation. "Take this (recent mid-term) election. The NAACP in a good and 
normal time would have been out there for weeks trying to get blacks out to 
vote," he said. "They have been virtually paralyzed by all their money troubles 
and could only do a little trifling stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Once Gibson is out of office, Rowan said, and a new management team is in 
place, he will use his column to urge supporters to send money back into the 
NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a group preparing for the moment when (Gibson) steps down so they 
can say to the nation, as I will say, 'The time has come to rush to the rescue 
to the support of this organization because the United States would be a lesser 
place without an NAACP,' " Rowan said. "But no way will I ask anybody to give a 
nickel as long as (Gibson) is there at the head of the NAACP because I know the 
extent to which the meager funds of the NAACP have been abused." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan also brushed aside suggestions he was an "Uncle Tom" or tool of the 
mainstream media, noting his 43 years as a Life Member of the NAACP. Among the 
highlights: Rowan "worked closely with (then NAACP attorney) Thurgood Marshall 
in the days way before Brown versus Board of Education." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For much of his life, Rowan has been defiantly confronting conventions of the 
day. He was one of the nation's first blacks to be a commissioned officer in 
the U.S. Navy, which enabled him to graduate from Oberlin College and to earn a 
master's degree in journalism from the University of Minnesota on the G.I. 
Bill. 
</P>
<P>
 He worked briefly at the Baltimore Afro-American, a black-owned newspaper, but 
left to become a copy editor at the Minneapolis Tribune and one of the few 
blacks working within the white press in the late 1940s. His reporting on race 
relations in the segregated South during the 1950s brought him fame and 
recognition, as well as close associations with such civil rights leaders as 
former NAACP General Secretary Roy Wilkins, Urban League President Whitney 
Young and Marshall. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1961, seeking to integrate the all-white diplomatic corps, President John 
F. Kennedy appointed Rowan to be deputy secretary of state. Later, Kennedy 
tapped him as a U.N. delegate during the Cuban missile crisis and ambassador to 
Finland. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Lyndon Johnson Administration, Rowan sat in on Cabinet and National 
Security Council meetings as director of the United States Information Agency. 
In that capacity, Rowan was privy to secret FBI documents on the activities of 
the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., an issue that some within the NAACP have 
pointed to as proof of Rowan's cozy ties to Hoover and his passion for 
attacking the civil rights leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's just hogwash," Rowan said. "Everybody in the world knows J. Edgar 
Hoover hated my guts and he made it known with a passion." 
</P>
<P>
 In his 1991 autobiography, "Breaking Barriers," Rowan made it clear he felt 
the same about Hoover. "The FBI director had turned his powerful agency into a 
ruthless foe of blacks and the civil rights movement because Hoover hated the 
idea of black equality and because King had dared to criticize him," Rowan 
wrote. "I knew that Hoover's hatred of this most articulate, most inspiring of 
all the civil rights leaders, and King's apparent vulnerability to Hoover's 
assaults, jeopardized not just my USIA budget but the whole campaign for civil 
rights and black equality." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked about his relationship with Hoover and King, Rowan admitted to 
having "one disagreement" with King concerning the minister's sermons against 
the Vietnam War, which angered Johnson. "We were close friends," he said of 
King. "I tried to warn him about the things Hoover and the FBI were doing. 
President Johnson gave me permission to inform King about wiretaps and smear 
tactics used by Hoover, and I tried to persuade King to watch what he did and 
with whom he did it." 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan said his fight with Gibson and the NAACP board pale in comparison to his 
battles with Hoover. "The Hoover business was more vociferous than this," he 
said. "But I felt just as secure then as I do now because I know what I'm 
writing is right and eventually it will all come out in the public." 
</P>
<P>
 But why is Carl Rowan airing the NAACP's dirty linen now? 
</P>
<P>
 "The time comes when you know that silence in the face of arrogant destruction 
makes you guilty to a great degree," Rowan said. "I have no agenda whatsoever 
for picking the next director or board chairman. But I do know they have got to 
reconstruct the board." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, he's won one battle toward that goal. 
</P>
<P>
 In an 801-word column released by the syndicate on Aug. 8, Rowan fired his 
opening shot. He wrote that he possessed documents suggesting an "adulterous 
relationship" between Chavis and a former employee, Mary E. Stansel. He also 
alleged the former executive director "used at least $64,000 of NAACP funds as 
initial 'hush' payments" to prevent her from filing suit against him and the 
NAACP. 
</P>
<P>
 That column scored a direct hit. Across the nation, in small towns and major 
urban areas, fax machines and grapevine gossip spewed word of Rowan's columns 
among NAACP members and supporters. Major newspapers such as the New York 
Times, the Baltimore Sun, the Wall Street Journal and the Los Angeles Times 
noticed as well, initiating their own probes into the NAACP's administrative 
and financial problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan said he often sees his work slightly reworked or reproduced in 
newspapers without his byline. "That's all right because it's the service I'm 
providing," he said. "As far as I'm concerned that's a part of the job of 
getting the major media to focus on some of the things they would not 
necessarily focus on." 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the NAACP's troubles became a well-worked story. People were talking 
about Chavis' secret $332,000 settlement of a sexual harassment charge, about 
the NAACP's debts that were soaring into the millions of dollars. By late 
August, Chavis was history, forced out by the board of directors and bitterly 
complaining of unfair media attacks on his administration. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks following Chavis' firing, Rowan continued to pound away in this 
columns at Gibson. Citing unnamed sources and secretly obtained documents, 
Rowan wrote that Gibson "double-dipped" thousands of dollars in expense 
reimbursements from the organization and used his NAACP-provided American 
Express card to live an elaborate lifestyle relative to most members of the 
civil rights group. 
</P>
<P>
 Gibson, a Greenville, S.C., dentist, has denied Rowan's accusations.  
</P>
<P>
 Appearing last month at an NAACP South Carolina State Convention assembly in 
Florence, Gibson branded Rowan a "Judas Iscariot" and a "house nigger" to 
shouts of affirmation and support. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, that doesn't bother me," Rowan said, when asked about Gibson's comments. 
"I don't believe even a fraction of the blacks in this nation believe that. 
I've heard that all my professional life. My job is to tell the public things I 
think they ought to know and don't already know. If I see an injustice to 
African Americans, I feel it is my duty to tell the public about it. I make no 
apologies about that." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Without question, Rowan has shaken public confidence in the NAACP's 
leadership, rattling its support, from the grass roots to its contributing 
foundations to its embattled executive suites. Grants from private corporations 
and philanthropic organizations have been curtailed pending an independent 
investigation into the NAACP's financial affairs. Money from local and state 
branches has stopped flowing into the national headquarters, forcing officials 
to furlough about 90 employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Rowan said many of his sources have come to him after reading his columns in 
the State newspaper in Columbia, S.C., and the Baltimore Sun (Baltimore is home 
to the NAACP's national headquarters). Those papers have been important in 
generating new sources because NAACP members -- with knowledge of Gibson's 
activities in South Carolina and headquarters operations -- fax Rowan's stories 
to others across the nation and information to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is quite a network going on out there," Rowan said. "When members start 
asking questions, more and more people call me with information." 
</P>
<P>
 To prove his point, he rose from his living room chair to answer the telephone 
in another part of the house and returned a few minutes later, snaking fax 
paper behind him. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is from the State newspaper in Columbia, S.C.," he said. "The State has 
written an editorial calling for Gibson to resign." 
</P>
<P>
 The largest newspaper in South Carolina had a lead editorial titled: "For the 
sake of the NAACP, Chairman Gibson must go." The editorial read: "Columnist 
Carl Rowan's accusations . . . is but one reason for his dismissal." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas N. McLean, editorial page editor at the State, said he has published 
every one of Rowan's seven columns attacking the NAACP since last summer. "I 
think Mr. Rowan's reporting is the basis of our decision here. . . . There 
wasn't much debate. Mr. Rowan's work has been pretty through and devastating." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the Baltimore Sun has run every one of Rowan's columns. But Barry 
Rascovar, editorial page director at the Sun, said the newspaper stopped short 
of calling for Gibson's resignation. 
</P>
<P>
 For some critics of his work, however, Rowan's columns have no credibility. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Carl Rowan is an absolute disgrace to the African American race," 
said Larry Carter, an NAACP board member from Des Moines, Iowa. "It seems like 
he's trying to take a short crawl back to the plantation. He's done the African 
American community an injustice." 
</P>
<P>
 Kelly Alexander Jr., who directs the NAACP's North Carolina State Conference 
and supports Gibson's leadership, said Rowan's columns create a buzz among 
NAACP members and reporters often before he has an opportunity to read them. 
</P>
<P>
 "He stirred the pot," Alexander said bitterly. "Every time the issues he 
raised came down from boiling to a simmer, he stirs the pot again so it comes 
to a boil again." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemphill Pride II, an attorney and former president of the NAACP branch in 
Columbia, S.C., is one of Rowan's supporters: 
</P>
<P>
 "Carl Rowan appears to be outraged about the shenanigans that have occurred at 
the NAACP under the watch of this generation of leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Pride, a Life Member of the NAACP who is also filing legal challenges to 
obtain the financial records of the S.C. NAACP branches controlled by Gibson, 
said it took courage for Rowan to write about the NAACP in a critical fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one likes to criticize the NAACP because of the long and successful 
history of the organization," he said. "It's uncomfortable to air dirty laundry 
in public. But that's a sword that cuts both ways because if black leadership 
fails to be kept accountable, a lot of people will be taken advantage of in the 
process." 
</P>
<P>
 That's how Rowan sees it too. He said his columns provide a sense of 
empowerment to the rank-and-file membership of the NAACP to demand 
accountability from their leaders, even if it breaches the myth of maintaining 
racial solidarity. 
</P>
<P>
 "Previously, black America hadn't paid much attention" to the inner workings 
of the NAACP and its board, Rowan said. "They didn't really know what was going 
on. I'm not the protector of anything. Eventually, I have to write the truth."

EBELL SOCIETY DRESSES FOR TURN OF A CENTURY; EVENT: O.C.'S OLDEST WOMEN'S CLUB 
FASHIONS AN ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION FROM ITS RICH LOG OF GUESTS AND MEMBERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHRYN BOLD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Celebrating guest appearances that have ranged from Amelia Earhart to Mr. 
Blackwell, Orange County's oldest women's club marked its 100th anniversary on 
Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Ebell Society of the Santa Ana Valley also stepped into the 
past and portrayed their predecessors at the event held in the society's 
70-year-old clubhouse on French Street in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Some checked their identities at the door and wandered about the old 
Spanish-style clubhouse in costume as they played their characters. Others wore 
authentic vintage dresses that had belonged to past Ebell members. 
</P>
<P>
 On stage in the clubhouse auditorium, members re-enacted highlights from the 
history of the society. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeanne Williams sported a 1940s rust-colored gown with a jeweled neckline that 
belonged to her grandmother, Ruth Segerstrom, an Ebell past president 
(1947-1949). The dress was one of a half-dozen on loan from the Segerstrom 
collection. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days the Ebell Society was the thing to belong to -- it was very 
elegant," said Ruth Ann Moriarty, Williams' mother and Segerstrom's daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Edith Lyon, club president, wore a turn-of-the-century navy gown to portray 
Amanda Blee, the group's original first vice president and Santa Ana's first 
telegrapher. 
</P>
<P>
 "We moved to Santa Ana in 1937, and she lived across the street from us," Lyon 
said. "I used to visit her in her parlor as a little girl. She'd talk to me 
while sitting in her rocking chair -- but I don't remember a thing she said." 
</P>
<P>
 Lyon's mother, Edna, was also an Ebell president. In 1945, at age 42, she was 
the youngest woman ever elected to the post. Marilyn Blackwood (who in 1983 was 
the second-youngest president), portrayed Edna Lyon, wearing her original navy 
and lace gown.  
</P>
<P>
 "Edna's goal would have been to see this day," Blackwood said. "This club has 
had an important place in the community. For a long time it was the only 
educational, cultural and social outlet for women." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the characters took turns parading on stage while narrator Maureen 
Rischard, a club member since 1950, recounted the club's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The first meeting took place Nov. 16, 1894, when 23 women met in the home of 
Mrs. J.R. Medlock. Named after a doctor who founded the society in Oakland, the 
Ebell society was designed to provide women with educational and social 
opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
 While on stage most members pretended to sip tea or play cards -- two enduring 
club pastimes -- but some got into the spirit of their characters. As Lorita 
Baker Vallely, a dynamic guest speaker from 1950, member Gloria Turtenwald took 
her role seriously, pretending to mouth an entire speech complete with 
exaggerated facial expressions. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Cole played Mr. Blackwell, the caustic fashion critic who, in his 1978 
visit to the club, admonished member Betty Regan (played with relish by Dorothy 
Hurd) to cover her knees with her coat. 
</P>
<P>
 Evelyne Andrick played Anne Sullivan to Lenora Homyer's Helen Keller. The 
famous teacher and her blind and deaf pupil visited the club in 1914. Josephine 
Alleman sported a bomber jacket and flight goggles to play Amelia Earhart, who 
spoke to the group in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1967, Ebell could boast of 1,281 members. Now membership stands at about 
250 -- the result of women entering the work force and not having enough time 
to join clubs. Annual dues have grown from $1.20 (10 cents per month) to $100 
to help pay for insurance, clubhouse upkeep and activities. Still, the club's 
remaining members are devoted to the society. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the only club where women can come, play cards and just enjoy 
fellowship," said Marjorie Fluor Moore, a member since 1959. "For women, this 
is a haven." 
</P>
<P>
 Cast members included Stella Dodge (in an 1894 brocade cape and authentic pin 
tuck skirt from the Segerstrom collection), Virginia Russell, Mildred Fleck, 
Ruth Badger (as 1894 pianist Coralinn Rice), Laura Garthe, Opal Kissinger (as 
Madame Modjeska, who visited Ebell in 1905), Karen Reese, LaVerne Laskey, Jean 
Baez, Carol Smith, Barbara Schmid, Frances Laster and Vito Pulati (as violinist 
Murray Korda).

ATTRACTED TO THAT HEALTHY GLOW?; SCIENCE: YOU THINK YOU'RE A SUCKER FOR A 
PRETTY FACE, BUT EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGIST RANDY THORNHILL THINKS WHAT YOU'RE 
REALLY GOING GA-GA OVER IS A POTENT IMMUNE SYSTEM.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prof. Randy Thornhill is studying the languorous, lingerie-clad form of 
Stephanie Seymour in a Victoria's Secret catalogue with clinical detachment. 
</P>
<P>
 The model's pouty lips and prominent cheekbones signal that she has high 
levels of estrogen, he observes. Ditto for the small lower jaw and overall 
flatness of her face. 
</P>
<P>
 Leafing through the rest of the catalogue, Thornhill finds confirmation of his 
theories of human beauty on every page. 
</P>
<P>
 "The models are just exaggerated forms of attractiveness that is on a 
continuum," he says. "They really all look alike when you account for hair 
color and eye color and that kind of stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill, an evolutionary biologist at the University of New Mexico, thinks 
he knows why we see some women as beautiful and some men as handsome: They 
display traits -- in some cases, influenced by hormones such as estrogen -- 
that we are genetically predisposed to read as signs of a strong immune system. 
That, in turn, makes them more desirable as potential mates in the age-old 
battle to see whose genes survive. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a theory sure to make feminists and humanists grit their teeth. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill rejects the widespread view that influences such as TV commercials 
and Vogue fashion layouts have conditioned us to see certain people as 
attractive. Our notions of beauty, he believes, are largely innate. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that people's judgments of faces are highly correlated," he says. 
"You can take pictures from people in one culture and show them to people in 
another culture and they will rank them the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's clearly something going on with human nature with regard to 
attractiveness. We think we're getting it." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill, who at 49 looks a lot like Dick Clark, works out of a small office 
and lab in the UNM biology department. His desk is littered with papers, a 
plastic surgery text and the tools of his trade: calipers and a tape measure he 
uses on volunteer subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 A bumper sticker on a file cabinet reads, "Honk if you love Darwin." 
</P>
<P>
 His style is informal, and when he leans back in his chair to chat, his gently 
elongated vowels betray his Alabama roots. He's trying to quit smoking, and 
every so often he tucks a small pouch of smokeless tobacco in his cheek. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill belongs to a group of scientists who over the last 25 years have 
applied Charles Darwin's theory of evolution by selection to people and their 
behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern Darwinists maintain that our primary purpose in life, whether we are 
aware of it or not, is to transmit our genes to our offspring. It's an 
imperative arising from millions of years of evolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern Darwinism is controversial because its emphasis on the role of genes in 
behavior seems to endorse stereotypical sex roles while implying that our 
actions are "programmed." (Men, according to Modern Darwinists, seek women who 
can bear many children, and may want to mate with as many women as possible to 
improve their reproductive odds. Women, on the other hand, are more apt to 
prefer men who will invest time and resources in helping to raise their young.) 
</P>
<P>
 But Thornhill says such objections are ill-founded. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of misunderstanding about the phenomenon of development," 
Thornhill says. "For any trait of the individual, both genes and environment 
are necessary to get the trait." 
</P>
<P>
 But why would we have evolved a preference for beautiful people in the first 
place? 
</P>
<P>
 In a word, parasites. 
</P>
<P>
 Some biologists think our evolution has been driven by competition with 
viruses, bacteria and other microorganisms that can produce millions of 
generations in the course of a human lifetime; each generation has a chance to 
evolve a new adaptation, posing a constant challenge to our immune systems. 
</P>
<P>
 People with greater diversity in their genes stand a better chance of evolving 
new ways to outmaneuver parasites. A key finding is that more genetically 
diverse individuals tend to have more symmetrical facial and body traits -- 
such features as eyes, hands and feet. 
</P>
<P>
 During gestation, and throughout life, the development of these features can 
be disrupted by infections, toxins, malnutrition and other stresses. The more 
symmetrical these features are, Thornhill argues, the more they advertise a 
person's ability to resist diseases. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill and a colleague, evolutionary psychologist Steve Gangestad, noted in 
a 1993 paper (see story, E5) that qualities of averageness and symmetricalness 
were closely linked with attractiveness, especially in women. But there is 
another component to attractiveness: Decidedly non-average features, such as a 
large jaw and prominent cheekbones in men, are rated more attractive by study 
subjects. 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill suspects this is because such exaggerated features develop during 
puberty under the influence of testosterone, which is known to suppress immune 
function. Thornhill reasons that a handsome man is advertising that his immune 
system is strong if it can withstand the effects of that extra testosterone. 
</P>
<P>
 This relentless probing into why some people are considered beautiful might 
encounter obstacles on many fronts, Thornhill acknowledges. 
</P>
<P>
 "My colleagues say some of the things we do here would not be politically 
correct elsewhere," he says dryly. "Darwin is the one who did it -- he got it 
all started. He really understood life deeply because he applied an 
evolutionary perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Researchers in other fields are far from convinced that our evolutionary 
history determines our perception of beauty. They question the methods and 
underlying assumptions of the new research. 
</P>
<P>
 Sarah Nelson, an archeologist and chairman of the University of Denver's 
anthropology department, wonders about researchers' use of questionnaires to 
elicit people's attitudes about attractiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can structure the answers by the way you ask the question," she says. And 
while cross-cultural surveys might seem like a good way to see if there are 
universal traits of attractiveness, getting unbiased data is difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "The whole world is now contaminated with American movies," Nelson says, and 
there is evidence our society's beauty ideals have been widely assimilated 
abroad. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who go out and do amateur anthropology are missing a lot of the 
sophistication that goes into anthropological fieldwork," Nelson says. 
</P>
<P>
 More fundamentally, she says, Modern Darwinists are trying to divine the 
origins of human sexuality using contemporary models of male-female relations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is really reading from our society into the past," she says. "They have 
no methodology for considering the past without reference to the present." 
</P>
<P>
 Lois Banner, a historian and chairman of the gender studies program at USC, 
sees in the new Darwinism the latest in a long line of scientific theories 
purporting to demonstrate that inequalities between people are "natural." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 19th Century, she notes, scientists used measurements of cranial 
capacity as "evidence" that men were smarter than women and whites smarter than 
blacks -- all decided on the basis of who had the largest brains. But even 
after a theory like that becomes discredited, she says, a new one springs up to 
take its place. 
</P>
<P>
 At DePaul University, social psychologist Midge Wilson has studied "lookism" 
-- discrimination on the basis of physical attractiveness. She's familiar with 
the notion of biological underpinnings to our perceptions of human beauty, but 
she doesn't give the theory much weight. 
</P>
<P>
 Given that a biological basis for attraction might exist, she says, "it 
accounts for such a small part of the picture of what keeps people together and 
what they might consider attractive." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson also thinks that changing roles for women, particularly in the 
workplace, have diminished the importance of their appearance. In this new 
climate, "Their reproductive fitness is not the only index of their 
desirability," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill is familiar with such objections. While defending his research 
methods, he contends most criticism comes from humanities and social sciences 
scholars whose "egalitarian" ideology doesn't allow for scientific facts. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kinds of criticisms are bothersome because they discredit the 
scientific knowledge we have of people's place in nature," he says. "To argue 
that some scientific theories have been wrong and that modern evolutionary 
theory is therefore wrong is typical humanist rhetoric." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill realizes that accepting an evolutionary basis for gender differences 
is tough for many people because it might be used to justify discrimination and 
other injustices. 
</P>
<P>
 Such fears arise from the "naturalist fallacy," which assumes that because 
things are by nature a certain way, that is how they ought to be, Thornhill 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say something is evolved is not to say it's right," he says. " 'Should' is 
coming from an entirely different domain than what is or is not." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thornhill doesn't recall a particular point when he decided to become a 
biologist, but he remembers a childhood spent collecting insects and snakes and 
bird-watching. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even as a kid I really tuned in to human behavior and psychology," he says. 
"It's been an obsession ever since I can remember." 
</P>
<P>
 When he was in graduate school at the University of Michigan in the early 
1970s, Modern Darwinism was the new wave, promising to provide a simple, 
coherent explanation for the mysteries of human nature. 
</P>
<P>
 He knows the idea of genetically encoded impulses and preferences seems to 
challenge the very notion of free will. It's an issue he constantly addresses 
in his undergraduate classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Many also wonder whether we are doomed to be blindly driven by primal 
evolutionary mandates, or whether we can transcend these biological 
imperatives. Thornhill is optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe you can, at some level," he says. "I think self-knowledge gives you 
more freedom."

MAD ABOUT L.A.; AT A TIME WHEN WE ALL SEEM TO WANT OUT, AUTHOR PETER THEROUX 
FINDS PLENTY OF REASONS TO STAY. WE 'HAVE ONE OF THE MORE PEACEFUL AND 
OPTIMISTIC MIXTURES OF CULTURES THAT YOU WILL EVER SEE.'

<TEXT>
<P>
 Each year of L.A.'s dramatic new troubles -- and endless round of Armageddon 
and Armageddon-outta-here -- made me more determined to stay. I decided to 
weigh in, not as an accidental tourist, but as something of an accidental 
resident. -- Peter Theroux in "Translating L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Theroux fell in love with Los Angeles the moment he arrived, and what 
was there not to love? 
</P>
<P>
 He was visiting -- or rather decompressing -- from almost five years in Saudi 
Arabia. It was November, 1984. The Olympics had just ended, and here were green 
lawns and flowers, homes and mountain views, ocean breezes and one particularly 
memorable dinner with friends at Lucy's El Adobe. 
</P>
<P>
 Now almost 10 years later, he has penned his love affair to the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Translating L.A.: A Tour of the Rainbow City" (Norton, 1994) is a wry, 
offhanded homage. Not since Randy Newman wrote his happy adulation has the City 
of Angels enjoyed such unapologetic praise. 
</P>
<P>
 Theroux, 38, lives in Signal Hill, works in Long Beach and keeps close ties to 
the Middle East working as a writer and a translator. 
</P>
<P>
 He speaks six dialects of Arabic. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is close enough to -- and far enough from -- the Middle East to 
suit this transplanted Bostonian, younger brother of adventure writer and 
novelist Paul Theroux, just fine. 
</P>
<P>
 Loving Los Angeles does not come easily. This is, after all, a city notorious 
for police brutality, senseless crime, filthy air, earthquakes, fires and 
floods. But Theroux looks at these problems from the perspective of having 
lived in the Middle East, a world almost "feudal" in its class system. 
</P>
<P>
 "The more negative people are about L.A.," he says, "the less they tend to 
know about the world. It isn't that the problems here should go unexamined, but 
we should realize that we are living in a fairly civilized setting." 
</P>
<P>
 It is a perspective that many are unwilling to concede. When asked by 
Theroux's publisher for a cover blurb, writer ("City of Quartz") and activist 
Mike Davis responded: "Properly shredded, I think the book would make excellent 
cat litter." The New York Times, while praising Theroux, referred to his 
investigation of the city as a "surface treatment." 
</P>
<P>
 Theroux makes no apologies. He admires Los Angeles with curiosity and a sense 
of humor. 
</P>
<P>
 Written as a series of tours, "Translating L.A." has a distinctly worldly 
point of view. Its chapters present lively explorations of the valleys, 
beaches, inner city and hinterlands without preconception. 
</P>
<P>
 The results are both serendipitous and surprising. 
</P>
<P>
 In Beverly Hills, he happens upon a Lebanese woman speaking French to her 
baby, who is crying for juice in Arabic. At Forest Lawn, he pauses to consider 
three Rastafarians photographing the sarcophagus of Liberace. In Santa Monica, 
he talks with a homeless woman hawking abandoned screenplays from a shopping 
cart. 
</P>
<P>
 The rainbow in the subtitle refers not so much to the city's varied ethnic 
palette as to a route ending in a pot of gold. At a time when everyone seems to 
be finding reasons to leave, Theroux finds plenty of reasons to stay. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's 100% right," says historian Kevin Starr. Now working in Sacramento as 
official state librarian, Starr tries to get back to Los Angeles every two 
weeks just "to place my hands on this dynamo." 
</P>
<P>
 "Why would one like London under Queen Elizabeth I?" he asks. "Or Jerusalem 
under Solomon, New York in the 1930s or San Francisco in the 1890s? You feel 
that Los Angeles is a city in the stages of reaching a defining moment for 
itself." 
</P>
<P>
 Another veteran observer of the city agrees. "I love it," says Warren Olney, 
host of the radio program "Which Way, L.A.?" 
</P>
<P>
 "L.A. provides me with a sense of hope for the future." If we can get it 
together here, Olney believes, then maybe the species will not self-destruct -- 
a comment that is even more significant considering one of his recent 
interviews. 
</P>
<P>
 When Olney asked Shimon Peres if there existed a model that the Israelis and 
Palestinians might consider in their peace accord, the Israeli foreign minister 
immediately cited Los Angeles, commenting on the tolerance that Angelenos seem 
to exercise so easily. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The point is not lost on Theroux. 
</P>
<P>
 Something miraculous happens when people arrive in the city. Hostilities and 
antagonisms don't seem to last, he says. While Angelenos are often criticized 
for being rootless, it is precisely this rootlessness that washes hatred and 
resentment clean. In comparison, Theroux looks at other places in the world -- 
Bosnia or Rwanda, for instance -- where people pay a terrible price for their 
deep roots. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether attending the Watts Tower Festival, riding Metrolink with sightseeing 
Koreans, or teaching literacy skills to a Vietnamese woman, Theroux appreciates 
Los Angeles as a multicultural environment without loading the issue with a 
self-conscious dose of political correctness. 
</P>
<P>
 "The diversity is one of the great things about L.A.," he says. "I think this 
city has one of the more peaceful and optimistic mixtures of cultures that you 
will ever see. We celebrate diversity here on a daily basis. We don't need a 
permit or a city council seat or a grant." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet it is precisely this point of view that most infuriated Davis when he read 
"Translating L.A." Just at a time when the city needs most to understand the 
recent changes -- best seen in the riots of 1992, the recession, the passage of 
Proposition 187 -- in walks Theroux telling everyone to lighten up. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, Theroux's book encapsulated New York publishers' attitude toward L.A. 
in general," Davis says. "It's what they have been doing for years -- have 
someone come into L.A. and have a quick look around and make fun of the natives 
and go back to Lower Manhattan and have a chuckle with friends." 
</P>
<P>
 Theroux is not afraid to be blunt. At one point in "Translating L.A.," he 
criticizes ethnic advocacy groups for turning cultural diversity into the 
"city's biggest bore," and he admits to finding in racial politics a certain 
amount of "show business and social climbing." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis was particularly offended by Theroux's chapter "La Lucha Continua," 
describing his visit to UCLA last year when students went on a hunger strike in 
a protest for a Chicano studies department. His depiction of "the struggle" 
focuses more on the irony than on the spirit of the occasion, a time when 
Schoenberg Plaza was renamed Plaza Aztlan and when portraits of Cesar Chavez, 
Pancho Villa and the Ayatollah Khomeini were hung from the strikers' tents. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found Theroux's attitude toward the hunger strikers a malignant piece of 
writing," Davis says. "I take heart in the militancy of kids. There is no 
better antidote for the demoralization of teens than to get them involved with 
other teens." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis believes that the student demonstration at UCLA, as well as the recent 
protests against Proposition 187, are important experiences. In a city that, in 
Davis' view, is waging war against its children by cutting education budgets, 
incarcerating gang members and failing to maintain its employment base, he has 
found "the most hopeful kids today are ones who are fighting for change." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet Theroux had a different point to make. "My experiences of college 
campuses," he writes, "have shown me that in certain cases the multiculturalism 
phenomenon was the opposite of broadening. At times it resembles a dogmatic 
tribal nationalism that actually rules out a multicultural understanding of 
humanity." 
</P>
<P>
 Nationalism used to preserve cultural identity, he believes, is a pernicious 
trend in any society, be it academic or urban. Cultures are far more durable 
than people want to admit, a lesson he learned in the Middle East after 
watching rituals with nearly prehistoric roots. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cultures are living things that are never really killed -- except by 
genocide," he says. "The idea of enshrining the Hispanic culture in California 
is stupid. Your internal culture, whether it's ethnic, religious or familiar, 
is a closed system. It survives within you. You don't need social training 
wheels to help it survive. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the best ways to threaten a culture is to ghettoize it, classify it as 
a political cause and separate it from the mainstream culture." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Theroux is aware how conservative he sometimes sounds, and it is a stance he 
is not beyond mocking. Yet no matter how much he may sound like "ol' Mr. 
Front-Porch America," he has more faith in the ability of individuals to 
preserve their roots than in a society's attempt to preserve them. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, too, he believes it is something of a specious cause. As a 
tutor in the literacy program at the Long Beach Public Library, he came in 
contact with immigrants more concerned with making a living and assimilating 
than turning their cultural ties into a political issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Shula, an Israeli who one day told him that Los Angeles reminded her of 
Tel Aviv. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why do you want to live here if it's so similar?" he asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Her answer -- "There's no war or threat here, the economy is better, I can 
make money and a good reputation as a beautician here" -- showed him a 
perspective many Angelenos never see, judging by the wide support for 
Proposition 187. Shula belongs to a very serious, committed group of people -- 
some legal, some not -- who know how good they have it here. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, this boot-straps mentality does have another side -- a reluctance, 
as Davis points out, to look at what is being dismantled and destroyed while 
focusing only on the rebuilding and reinventing. 
</P>
<P>
 Olney agrees: "I think there is a tendency, now that no one is throwing rocks 
and burning buildings, to want to think everything is fine when it isn't. The 
root cause of the rage and desperation has not been dealt with." 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, Olney grew up with the idea of Los Angeles as a "blossoming place." 
Today he believes there is still more blossoming to be done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Otherwise you just throw up your hands," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 From his own point of view, Theroux denies taking a "just say no" approach to 
what ails Los Angeles, but he believes that in a city "as big and exhibitionist 
as ours, everything gets worked out." 
</P>
<P>
 But Theroux recognizes that solutions are not easy to come by. 
</P>
<P>
 "Angelenos are working at a disadvantage," he says. "We believe that life must 
end like a movie. So we have to wonder what we can do to work toward that happy 
ending. And why not? 
</P>
<P>
 "But in Los Angeles, life is less a movie than a documentary. From one day to 
the next, for better or worse, there is no end. We may want 'High Noon,' but 
we've got 'Gandhi' instead."

SO WHY THE NEED TO ATTACK THE CITY OF ANGELS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS CURWEN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 L.A. bashing has always been good sport. 
</P>
<P>
 Woody Allen certainly wasn't the first when (in "Annie Hall") he cited the 
ability to make a right-hand turn on red as the city's sole cultural advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Bertolt Brecht called Los Angeles a coal mine and a sewer, and Aldous Huxley 
swore that "No man could find a better spot on Earth, if only he had some 
intelligent person to talk to." 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly Peter Theroux as a journalist and critic is aware of the company he 
keeps. In "Translating L.A.," from which these early examples are drawn, he 
writes: "L.A. books often seethe with tendentious exhibitions of adoration, 
bitchery or gloating pessimism." 
</P>
<P>
 As he tries to avoid those pitfalls himself, he comes to understand the 
phenomenon the same way a meteorologist might understand smog. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the supercilious condescension toward Los Angeles," he says, "is a 
cover for an annoyed curiosity, a certain exasperation -- how can that place be 
so big and important when it really should just be a resort." 
</P>
<P>
 He also believes the snide barbs that the city endures have something to do 
with the city's promise of prosperity. For Faulkner, Brecht and Huxley, Los 
Angeles represented an opportunity to make money, a motive that Theroux 
contends put them on the defensive. If they had moved here for any other reason 
-- say, the weather, the cocktail parties or the stimulating conversation -- 
why would they have become so venomous? 
</P>
<P>
 In the same way, Thomas Mann, Anthony Powell and Evelyn Waugh loved Los 
Angeles, but they too gave it "the same sort of ritual hazing, to show that 
they had not sold out." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, envy also plays a role in eliciting contempt for the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "Los Angeles has been at the end of the rainbow, the repository of dreams, the 
dream factory," says Warren Olney, host of the radio program "Which Way, L.A.?" 
"People come here and are disappointed, which makes it easy for them to 
contrast the reality with the dreams that the city has engendered." 
</P>
<P>
 Historian Kevin Starr finds bashing the stamp of "bourgeois intellectuals," 
who have yet "to envision a new kind of city, both in terms of its physical 
form and in terms of its melding high and pop culture." 
</P>
<P>
 In "Translating L.A.," Theroux has placed himself on the other side of the 
critical spectrum, so much so that his vision of the city -- to critics -- 
smacks of boosterism. Certainly it is a perspective that doesn't lead to the 
fatalism that prompts many people to write this city off. Boosterism -- if that 
is the word -- goes a long way toward instilling pride, even offering some 
sense of enfranchisement within this seemingly embittered metropolis. 
</P>
<P>
 Theroux's wry humor helps him maintain his perspective on the city. Never 
intending to write an analysis of Los Angeles, he was more interested in 
something "small and ironic." 
</P>
<P>
 If "Translating L.A." is well received, he suspects it is because people are 
ready for an unfashionable point of view -- that life in Los Angeles is not all 
that bad. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very easy to write about places that you hate," he contends. "You can 
take all the cheap shots you want. Writing about a place you have a real 
affection for is a more thoughtful process. It's difficult to be positive in a 
sprightly way and sound like you know what you're talking about. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have a little bit of depth, depth that comes from knowing a place 
and making the effort to see how it all falls into place." THOMAS CURWEN

BODY WATCH; HOLIDAY TRIMMINGS; IT'S A SEASONAL AXIOM: OVEREAT NOW, PAY LATER. 
BUT YOU CAN REDUCE THE POTENTIAL FOR ADDED POUNDS BY FOLLOWING SOME 
COMMON-SENSE PRECAUTIONS. (AND RELAX, THAT DOESN'T MEAN DEPRIVING YOURSELF.)

 So what's another cookie? 
</P>
<P>
 This seems to be the universal motto of the holiday season -- the mantra that 
guides us from Thanksgiving dinner, through office holiday parties, Hanukkah 
celebrations, Christmas dinner and ultimately to New Year's Eve. 
</P>
<P>
 'Tis the season of scarfing, rationalizing and blimping out like an inflatable 
Fred Flintstone doll. 
</P>
<P>
 "For some people, it's like a six-week eating orgy," says Francie Berg, editor 
of the North Dakota-based Healthy Weight Journal. According to Berg, it's not 
unusual to gain 10 pounds over the holidays. So here are 10 ways to ward off 
the extra weight. 
</P>
<P>
 1. Don't deny yourself. 
</P>
<P>
 If you're lusting after pumpkin pie on Thanksgiving Day, you'd better cut 
yourself a piece. Otherwise you'll end up wolfing down an entire pie the next 
day. 
</P>
<P>
 "People go through a holiday meal cutting and restricting their favorite 
foods, and they end up feeling really unsatisfied," says Bonnie Modugno, a 
Santa Monica registered dietitian. But this is not license to gorge on every 
dish in sight. "Become very discriminating with what you choose to eat," she 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Eat regular meals, especially breakfast. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll be less likely to pig out if you avoid becoming a ravenous monster in 
the first place. Before each party, satisfy your hunger with three or four 
ounces of protein such as chicken or lean beef or one cup of beans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sugar and fat metabolize differently than a well-balanced meal," Modugno 
says. "If you just eat sugar all day long, you're going to continue to crave 
it. So before you get yourself ill, short-circuit the process by having a 
sandwich." 
</P>
<P>
 3. Move. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, as in exercise . And we don't mean laps around the buffet table. Biceps 
curls with your beer can don't count either. If you work out regularly, a 
little gluttony here and there won't matter. Besides, exercise is a perfect way 
to cut down on time spent with annoying relatives. If you say, "I'm sorry I 
can't stay and visit -- I've got to go to the gym," they won't be insulted; 
they'll be in awe of your self-discipline.  
</P>
<P>
 But don't feel compelled to sweat for hours. Organize half-hour walks during 
your office lunch break. Or circle the mall a few times to scope out the stores 
before you shop. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Avoid temptation. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't keep a jar of Hershey's Kisses on your desk. Don't fill your house with 
bowls of peanuts. Don't hang candy canes on your Christmas tree -- you might 
end up eating all your ornaments. But don't eliminate food from your home and 
office altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fill your desk drawer with healthy snacks, like crunchy vegetables, nonfat 
yogurt and SnackWell's Fat-Free Whole Wheat Crackers," suggests Elizabeth 
Somer, a registered dietitian in Salem, Ore. "Go armed into battle." 
</P>
<P>
 If fat-free whole-wheat crackers don't bring the word yum to mind, at least 
keep your surroundings stocked with something healthier than fudge brownies. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Rejoice in the holiday spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The season shouldn't be 90% eating," Berg says. "We need to think about 
relationships, love and giving -- the social pleasures of spending time with 
our friends and relatives." When you go to a party, focus on the fun and 
conversation, and eliminate the mindless munching. "You don't really need to be 
chewing on nuts every third sentence," Modugno says. 
</P>
<P>
 6. Stress less and get your sleep. 
</P>
<P>
 This advice doesn't seem too practical -- sort of like telling Siberians to 
avoid cold weather in the winter. But experts say it's possible to reduce 
holiday anxiety. 
</P>
<P>
 "Re-evaluate what has to be done," Modugno says. Rather than probe the 
universe for the perfect gift for each of your 27 cousins, get your family to 
draw names so that each person buys and receives one gift. 
</P>
<P>
 Recognize that overeating during the holidays isn't related to just the 
overabundance of food. "The fatigue, stress and time crunch are much more the 
problem," Modugno says. 
</P>
<P>
 7. Cook low-fat foods. 
</P>
<P>
 Don't mess with your favorite dishes, but do experiment with low-fat and 
low-calorie versions of some holiday foods and desserts. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can make dressing without a cube of butter," Modugno says. In your quest 
to lighten up your meals, just make sure you read labels carefully; low-fat 
eggnog has a lot less fat than regular eggnog, but because of the increased 
sugar contest, it has nearly as many calories. 
</P>
<P>
 8. Take small portions and eat slowly. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no need to model your Thanksgiving plate after the Eiffel Tower -- you 
can always go back for more. And when you do return to the table after 
assembling your masterpiece, take time to utter at least one complete sentence 
between bites. 
</P>
<P>
 "People scarf down that first plate so fast they don't taste anything, and of 
course they have to go back for seconds," Modugno says. "Slow down so you can 
actually taste the food." 
</P>
<P>
 9. Stop eating when you're full. 
</P>
<P>
 Pay attention to how stuffed you feel, and quit before your belt makes a 
permanent indentation in your stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 10. Don't strive for perfection. 
</P>
<P>
 If you overeat or skip exercise for a few days, forgive yourself and get back 
on track. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get embedded in irrational thinking: 'Hell, I've already blown it. This 
won't count,' " Modugno says. Of course, it does -- a fact people tend to avoid 
until January. "Then everyone's out there starving themselves," she says. 
"They're so frantic at the consequences of their behavior the last two months."

BODY WATCH; AS THE STOMACH TURNS; PERSONAL HEALTH: SOME PEOPLE RARELY FEEL 
NAUSEATED; OTHERS GET QUEASY EASY. IT ALL DEPENDS ON HOW YOUR NERVOUS SYSTEM 
COPES.

 What do roller coaster rides, pregnancy and big, heavy meals have in common? 
They can all make you feel sick to your stomach. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There are no hard-and-fast rules for what makes a tummy queasy. Just as some 
people faint at the sight of blood, some of us have stronger stomachs than 
others. 
</P>
<P>
 "The physiology of nausea is poorly understood," says Dr. Ed Share, an 
attending gastroenterologist at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 What we do know is that when the nervous system is stimulated, it sends a 
message to the brain, which in turn can set the stomach into motion, says Dr. 
Frank Hamilton, chief of the gastrointestinal disease branch of digestive 
disease and nutrition for the National Health Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 "It all depends on how your individual nervous system reacts to various 
stimuli," Hamilton says. 
</P>
<P>
 This explains why stress can create a sick stomach, why flu viruses affect us 
in varying degrees or why strong smells may send us to the bathroom. Hamilton 
says pregnant women often feel sick because they produce more progesterone, 
which can kick the nervous system into a higher gear. 
</P>
<P>
 Taming a touchy stomach is an individual matter as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "The reason there are so many treatments for nausea is that there's nothing 
that works on a regular basis," Share says. "People may say that crackers and 
sodas work, but there is no scientific evidence that they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sifting through a variety of homespun remedies, Hamilton and Share offer some 
advice of their own: 
</P>
<P>
 * Lie down and try to relax. 
</P>
<P>
 * Over-the-counter medications that neutralize acids, bind toxins, work on gas 
or prevent motion sickness are best used before vomiting occurs. (They won't 
stop nausea.) 
</P>
<P>
 * Eat and drink moderately. 
</P>
<P>
 * Peppermint, a home remedy many consider soothing to the stomach, may cause 
more upset. Ditto for milk. 
</P>
<P>
 * Do not give liquids to someone who is vomiting. This can induce further 
vomiting and hasten dehydration. 
</P>
<P>
 * One hour after vomiting has stopped, try ice chips, then a sip of water, 
cola or ginger ale. The idea is to begin swallowing, allowing things to move in 
the right direction. Chewing gum helps. 
</P>
<P>
 * See a doctor if you are vomiting blood, or if vomiting is accompanied by 
symptoms such as abdominal pain, headache, dizziness, fever, fast heartbeat, or 
if continual vomiting lasts more than four hours.

BRUCE COCKBURN: INTERIOR MOTIVE; POP MUSIC: NOW THAT THE WORLD'S POLITICAL 
LANDSCAPE HAS CHANGED, THE ROCKER, WHO COMES TO THE COACH HOUSE ON WEDNESDAY, 
HAS SET ASIDE GLOBAL ISSUES TO FOCUS INWARDLY. FOR NOW, ANYWAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Was calling off the Cold War the way to get Bruce Cockburn to cool down? 
</P>
<P>
 No politicized rocker ever captured the in-your-guts heat of righteous anger 
more vividly than this versatile Canadian did with his searing "If I Had a 
Rocket Launcher" in 1984. It's the most vivid of several songs inspired by his 
travels in Central America during the period when the region was spattered with 
bloody little wars, stoked by the bigger but more controlled conflict between 
the Soviets and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Like every other well-known rocker who addressed those struggles during the 
Reagan-Bush era, Cockburn (pronounced Coburn ) leaned left and sided with the 
revolutionaries. With "Rocket Launcher," he imagined striking a blow for 
oppressed Guatemalan peasants; the same album, "Stealing Fire," included a 
paean to the Sandinista enterprise in Nicaragua. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade later, the Cold War is off and Cockburn's current album, "Dart to the 
Heart," sets aside overtly political issues to focus more inwardly on matters 
romantic, spiritual and philosophical. 
</P>
<P>
 Cockburn, who has released 22 albums since his debut in 1970, always has had a 
lot to say about inward as well as worldly concerns. But after a long streak of 
records dotted with protests against specific political, historical and 
environmental outrages, Cockburn -- like Jackson Browne, Sting and Peter 
Gabriel on their most recent albums -- clearly was less concerned this time 
with using the recording studio as a podium. 
</P>
<P>
 On the phone recently from a tour stop in Bozeman, Mont., Cockburn was asked 
about this seeming trend of topical songwriters turning inward. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tempting to try to make a generalization about it," he said. "I'm too 
inside my own thing to be that objective. But when you've been involved in 
(political themes) for a certain time, other things have been left unsaid. You 
address those (personal and inner concerns), and that will produce a little 
vacuum (of political expression) that has to be filled later on." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Cockburn, 49, says his current solo tour -- which includes a show Wednesday at 
the Coach House -- is a "mopping-up operation" covering cities he didn't touch 
in an extensive round of full-band performances earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 With the advent of the adult-alternative radio format, which offers a home on 
the airwaves for his sort of serious, folk- and roots-influenced approach, he 
has had reason to stay on the road doing heavy promotional work. An 
accomplished singer-songwriter who can support himself with adept guitar 
playing, he has built a solid cult following in the United States, occasionally 
breaking through with more widely heard songs such as "Rocket Launcher," 
"Lovers in a Dangerous Time" and his only Top 40 single, "Wondering Where the 
Lions Are" (1980). 
</P>
<P>
 Home, where he plans to spend more time in 1995 after keeping up a hectic pace 
of three studio albums in the past four years, is a farm outside Toronto, where 
the woman he lives with trains horses for show jumping. Cockburn, an outdoorsy 
type, has taken up the sport. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in a couple of little shows, but I'm competing against kids, 
basically, at my level. I started taking riding lessons in '87, I guess, 
because I was traveling in places where people use horses for transportation. 
You need to in a Third World country, once you get away from the capital city. 
I felt I should learn to operate an animal." 
</P>
<P>
 At the philosophic core of "Dart to the Heart" is a song about how humans tend 
to operate like animals in their worst moments, then show godly potential in 
their best. Cockburn calls it "Burden of the Angel/Beast," and says he isn't 
sure himself whether the angelic or the beastly occupies the greater part of 
human nature. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, I tend to think it's the latter, but it varies from day to day. It 
depends on the mood and what you've just encountered. I think we're just stuck 
with who we are, and (human nature) is always going to have both sides. I don't 
think we're redeemable in that sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we are redeemed spiritually," he added. (Cockburn often has tapped 
his Christian belief in writing songs. Last year, his holiday album, 
"Christmas," tried to invest such well-roasted chestnuts as "Silent Night," "O 
Little Town of Bethlehem" and "It Came Upon a Midnight Clear" with spiritual 
seriousness and a sense of fresh musical discovery.) 
</P>
<P>
 "But in terms of our earthly existence, (that beastly potential) is always 
there, no matter how much you try to let yourself do good. We are the weird 
animals we are, and we seem to be straddling this gap with one foot in the 
animal world entirely and the other foot in something we've never been able to 
entirely define for ourselves." 
</P>
<P>
 With such past album titles as "Joy Will Find a Way," "World of Wonders" and 
"Waiting for a Miracle," Cockburn clearly has been willing to entertain high 
hopes. But even with the defusing of superpower confrontation, he doubts that 
he will lack fresh fodder for future songs of outrage and anguish. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten or 20 years from now the Cold War is going to look like a picnic," he 
said. "There are other ways it can go, but given the usual way we carry things 
off as human beings, it doesn't look very hopeful to me. It may not be too long 
before we see the fruit of the plutonium-smuggling trade. We may be in for some 
hair-raising times." 
</P>
<P>
 In writing songs about big issues, he said he strives to ground himself in 
particular experiences that he can feel vividly. "Most often they're just a 
reaction to things, a kind of immediate emotional response to a situation I 
encounter," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lovers in a Dangerous Time," which leads off the same album that features 
"Rocket Launcher," seems to be drawn from the same Central American experience; 
one readily supposes the stirring number is an ode to romantic passion among 
the revolutionaries Cockburn met. 
</P>
<P>
 He says it actually was sparked by something much more ordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking about kids in a schoolyard, eighth-graders or ninth-graders 
who were bold enough to hold hands and feel the beginnings of passion for 
another person in the face of the no-future that they would be confronted with. 
I was thinking, 'How can they envision a life in the face of so many things 
that appear to threaten it?' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He maintains the revolutionaries-in-love interpretation works, though, and is 
pleased that some listeners have related the song to the AIDS crisis as well. 
Listeners sometimes are left guessing whether his songs of passionate yearning 
-- including the current album's "All the Ways I Want You" and "Bone in My Ear" 
-- are addressed to an earthly romantic partner, or a divine presence. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm writing the song, I'm entirely aware of which it is," he said. "To 
me (songs such as those two) are pretty carnal. But sometimes when you're 
expressing longing for a person, deeper things creep into it. It's fair enough 
if people want to read it the other way." 
</P>
<P>
 After spending 11 songs on "Dart to the Heart" dealing with the fears and 
yearnings that come with love, the emptiness and spiritual hopes that arise 
from the death of a friend, and the risky duality of human nature, Cockburn 
ends the album with "Tie Me at the Crossroads," a twangy, chug-along rocker 
that manages to grin a little. 
</P>
<P>
 Poking fun at himself, he shows that even hearts pierced by darts can have a 
light moment now and then.  
</P>
<P>
 "Although I want to be taken seriously, some people take it too far and start 
investing my insights with greater power than they ought to. At that point, you 
have to chuckle. It's great for other people to take you seriously, but you'd 
better not be guilty of doing it to yourself."

CROSSOVER DREAM COMES TRUE; MOVIES/TV: CUBAN REFUGEE MAYTE VILAN COMES TO THE 
U.S. AND TAKES AN ACTING CLASS. NOW SHE'S ON BIG AND SMALL SCREENS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By N.F. MENDOZA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At 23, Mayte Vilan's life reads like a movie treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 A Cuban refugee who arrived in the United States eight years ago unable to 
speak a word of English, she is currently on both the big screen and the small 
screen -- playing a police officer working with James Woods in the film "The 
Specialist" and portraying one of the crime solvers in Aaron Spelling's 
syndicated TV series "Robin's Hoods." 
</P>
<P>
 Spelling caught a glimpse of Vilan in a small guest role on another series 
"and said, 'This is the girl' -- and when he says that, it's a done deal," says 
"Robin's Hoods" producer John B. Moranville. "Let's face it. If there is one 
thing Aaron Spelling does better than anyone else, it's casting." 
</P>
<P>
 But getting this far wasn't quite so simple. "Her life and what she's done, 
it's like some turn-of-the-century, come-to-America-and-find-success story," 
Moranville declares. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was pretty rough getting used to a whole new country," Vilan acknowledges, 
recalling her earliest days in Miami, where her family settled after leaving 
Cuba. "I had to learn to deal with a lot of new stresses." 
</P>
<P>
 Even she is amazed at what she has accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in Cuba, I wanted to act, but by the time I arrived here, I had to put 
away that dream and lock it up," she says. "I thought I had to study something 
more practical and earn good money and help my family. I had to say over and 
over, 'This is just a dream and face reality.' " 
</P>
<P>
 But as a psychology student at Miami Dade Community College, she heard of an 
acting program within the school -- Prometeo -- run by a Spanish-speaking 
teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would take my regular classes during the day and then go to acting classes 
at night," she recalls. It took one class for her to realize her true calling: 
"The first day I got there, it was it for me." 
</P>
<P>
 When an Argentine telenovela (soap opera) production company arrived in Miami 
and began testing Spanish-speaking actresses, Vilan's teacher gathered her 
class together and sent them to audition. 
</P>
<P>
 To Vilan's surprise, she got a call back. "They asked what I'd done 
professionally and it was nothing. I had to give them a snapshot when they 
asked for a head shot." Despite her lack of experience, she got the role and 
spent 11 months on the telenovela "El Magnate." 
</P>
<P>
 Plays in both Spanish and English followed -- "It was very exciting and 
challenging doing my first role in English" -- then a Latin sitcom, "Corte 
Tropical," and two more telenovelas , "Guadalupe" and "Marielena." She also did 
a stint as a weather reporter on a Spanish-language news show. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vilan was determined to try her hand at more English-speaking roles. "The 
Latin soaps set me off with a good foot. I just wanted my career to take off. 
Of course, Hollywood was my ultimate goal." 
</P>
<P>
 That was achieved when director Luis Llosa cast her in "The Specialist." 
</P>
<P>
 "She was very professional," Llosa says. "She has tremendous possibilities. 
She combines this Latin beauty and sexiness and has all the good talent to 
match. She can also speak perfect English to mainstream into any film." 
</P>
<P>
 And what could be more mainstream than a series from one of television's most 
successful producers? On "Robin's Hoods," Vilan plays Maria, one of five former 
"hoods" who now fight crime under the guidance of former assistant district 
attorney Brett Robin, played by Linda Purl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mayte adds this international flair to the show and she's a real knockout," 
producer Moranville says. "The thing I like about her is that she's actually 
very innocent and vulnerable off camera. She's not as hard-edged as her 
character." 
</P>
<P>
 Vilan, recently relocated to Los Angeles, hopes her two current roles will 
help change the tide of Latino stereotyping: "It's been changing, the way 
Latinos are portrayed. Hollywood took the loudest (most obvious) stereotypes of 
drug dealers and housekeepers and perpetuated it. But it was just out of 
ignorance." 
</P>
<P>
 She also hopes that Hollywood will soon distinguish between the different 
Latino cultures. "We may speak the same language, but with different accents 
and different backgrounds," she notes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, she's trying to savor what has happened to her. "This is a great and 
wonderful beginning for me," Vilan says excitedly. "It doesn't happen to 
everybody and I know it. This year has been like 'Boom!' -- an explosion for 
me, so many great things. I guess you just can't stop destiny." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Robin's Hoods" airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. on KCOP-TV Channel 13.

THAT'S MR. BEAVIS AND BUTT-HEAD TO YOU; MIKE JUDGE THOUGHT HIS MTV TWITS WOULD 
CREATE A BUZZ -- 'BUT NEVER THIS BIG' 
</P>

 He's hardly the guy you would pick out as the star amid the glittery-glam of 
the MTV offices in Times Square. The clothes are strictly Gap Outlet. The face 
is only one shade short of ultra-pasty. The hairline (gasp!) is receding. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet despite all this lack of hipness, Mike Judge is one of those folks who 
creates what those in the business call "noise" for MTV. If there is "noise," 
that means people are talking about you and not about someone else. And Mike 
Judge created the "noise" for MTV called "Beavis and Butt-head." 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly enough, at a network where longevity is usually measured in 
minutes, Judge's "Beavis and Butt-head" cartoon remains a cult hit more than a 
year and a half after the dull-witted duo from Buttmunch City first breathed 
their "heh-heh-hehs" to an adoring MTV multitude. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's funny -- I used to sit and watch MTV, and it made me feel old and like a 
complete dork," said Judge, 32, who created "Beavis and Butt-head" and still 
supervises its animation and does most of the male voices. "If you look at it, 
everyone is super-good-looking, super-hip, really fashionable and has a nice 
body. I still come here and most people don't recognize me, and I get dirty 
looks from these hip production assistants in leather jackets who whisper, 
'Who's this old guy?' I still watch MTV and think, 'I'm over the hill.' " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Beavis and Butt-head," which certifies Judge as clearly not over the hill, is 
an animated half-hour centered around two of the most uncool 14-year-olds you 
can imagine. Much of the show is taken up with the T-shirted Beavis and 
Butt-head talking over or criticizing, in adolescent language, bad rock videos. 
In between, there are cartoons with a vague story line, most of which end up 
with Beavis and Butt-head grinning dimly and looking stupid. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge had taken up animation only three years before when he presented the 
first "Beavis and Butt-head" cartoon, "Frog Baseball," to the International 
Festival of Animation. The main action in "Frog Baseball" was the two giggling 
idiots bashing frogs with baseball bats. MTV bought the episode for its late 
video melange, "Liquid Television," and from there brought Judge in to make a 
series, which debuted in March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 It was firmly established as a cult show by two things. First, parents and 
school officials hated it, calling it inane and insensitive. That hooked 
teen-agers right off. And then, in October, 1993, a 5-year-old boy set fire to 
his home in Ohio, killing his 2-year-old sister. The mother blamed "Beavis and 
Butt-head," and MTV quickly reacted by canceling the show's early-evening 
airing and confining it to late night. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge stayed away from interviews for months after the latter incident, but he 
was clearly torn up about it. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I heard about that I thought, 'That's awful.' I have kids myself," said 
Judge, the father of a 3-year-old daughter and another born in June. "That's 
the worst thing in the world, that a kid died. 
</P>
<P>
 "But then I thought, 'Wait a minute! Kids started fires in my neighborhood. 
Kids have been starting fires forever.' " And some news outlets distorted the 
story, he contended, failing to question what sort of supervision the mother 
had provided if the boy was able to get hold of a cigarette lighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think when a kid dies it's such an awful thing that you're grasping, 
looking for something. I know I wouldn't be thinking clearly if something like 
that had happened to me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge thinks much of the controversy stemmed from "Beavis & Butt-head" airing 
on MTV, which has had more than its share of criticism. Nonetheless, he said he 
likes the fact that "Beavis & Butt-head" is on cable, because parents who don't 
approve of his brand of humor can keep their children away from it. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to order cable. You have to say, 'I'm paying 30 bucks a month for 
these 51 extra channels,' " he said. "If you complain, it's like going out and 
buying Hustler and leaving it on your coffee table and complaining to the 
publisher that your kid is seeing pictures of nasty stuff. You can lock out 
MTV. Raising kids isn't easy, but it is easy to lock cable TV out of your 
house." 
</P>
<P>
 This spring, Judge and his family moved to Austin, home of Texas blues and 
Texas hip. They had been living outside Dallas -- he working as a musician, his 
wife in an electronics firm -- when MTV asked them to relocate to New York so 
he could work on "Beavis and Butt-head" at the company's main animation studio. 
But he'd grown up in Albuquerque, and said he is far more comfortable in the 
small cities of the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost never get recognized, so I can do the same old things I always did," 
he said. "We just know a lot of people there (in Austin), and it's one of my 
favorite towns anyway. It has everything I want in a city and it's still small. 
I don't want to paint too nice a picture because there are too many people 
moving there as it is." 
</P>
<P>
 Judge makes occasional trips to New York to approve the music videos that will 
be used in the series and to take care of other business, but generally works 
by fax, FedEx and video conferencing from Austin. The boys seem happier about 
it, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, actually, for a while, I was thinking, 'God, I don't know how much 
more of this I can do!' " he said. "Then something happened around January. I 
caught a second wind, with Howard Stern as inspiration. Not like you'd think. 
It's just that Howard Stern fills five hours a morning just talking. I started 
to think that rather than coming up with something to say about each video, to 
have them just talking. Beavis has developed a bit more lately, but, in any 
case, they are still just 14 forever." 
</P>
<P>
 MTV is also not done exploiting them just yet. There is a new Beavis and 
Butt-head video game to go along with shirts, hats and other paraphernalia. And 
the "Beavis & Butt-head Ensucklopedia," in which the boys pontificate on just 
about everything in their world, has just been published. (Sample excerpt under 
"J Is for Jobs": "Doctor -- This guy operates on you and gives you shots and 
stuff. But it's not as much fun as it sounds, 'cause like you have to go to 
school extra for it. On the other hand, you also get to see chicks naked, which 
is as much fun as it sounds, huh-huh.") 
</P>
<P>
 A "Beavis and Butt-head" movie is in the talking stages. The collected 
episodes will eventually be released on home video. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge, though, mainly works on the cartoon. "I was at the first meeting for 
the video game and then I said, 'Do what you want,' " he said. He hopes to use 
the series as a springboard to get out of animation -- he actually thinks he's 
not very good at it -- and into writing comic live-action screenplays. 
</P>
<P>
 "This will definitely be the only 14-year-old thing I ever do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge said he always thought there would be a "buzz, but never this big" about 
the boys, but he is still surprised their fame came on the flashiest of all 
networks, MTV. 
</P>
<P>
 "Beavis and Butt-head are not hipsters. They're not cool," he said. "They're 
awkward and ugly and dorky. After a while, you could get tired of them. For 
anything else, you could watch MTV and get this impression that the message is: 
'You will never be this cool, so don't even try.' 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy they gave this old, uncool guy a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Beavis and Butt-head" airs weekdays at 11 p.m. and weekends at 10 p.m. on 
MTV.

HEATING UP THE MTV LATINO CONNECTION; TELEVISION: VJ ALFREDO LEWIN, WHO HAS 
BECOME ALMOST AS POPULAR AS THE ROCK STARS HE INTERVIEWS, WANTS TO TAKE THE 
NETWORK TO NEW HEIGHTS AS A CULTURAL FORCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEILA COBO-HANLON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He is, in the eyes of many, Mr. MTV Latino. The one who gets more than 100 
letters a day, the guy with the long hair and the nice smile who can charm any 
audience and talk intelligently about hard rock. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alfredo Lewin, the 25-year-old VJ of "ConeXion MTV" and "Headbangers," 
appraises his new-found success with a level head. 
</P>
<P>
 As one of four VJs on Spanish-language MTV Latino, he has taken to heart what 
he perceives as his mission within the year-old network: Taking it beyond its 
self-proclaimed role as "the voice of rock 'n' roll" to become the cable 
channel that "will dictate the aesthetics, the 'vibe,' the way 
(Spanish-speakers) speak and feel." 
</P>
<P>
 It sounds like a daunting task, considering that MTV Latino reaches more than 
3.5 million homes in 20 countries (including the United States) with widely 
different cultures. But "ConeXion MTV" seems to bridge the gaps. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, it has made Lewin almost as popular as the rock stars he interviews. 
During a recent visit to his native Chile, autograph-seeking fans shattered a 
plate glass window in their determination to get a glimpse of him. 
</P>
<P>
 A far cry from one year ago, when not getting letters was the biggest worry 
that Lewin and his "ConeXion" producers had. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew we had the prestige of MTV," he explains, "but to think that people 
were going to write from places as far away as Santiago de Chile. . . . When we 
got our first letter from Bolivia, from smaller places, we were so proud." 
</P>
<P>
 The mail started pouring in within a few weeks. Perhaps it was the fact that 
Lewin had a similar TV program in Chile before getting his MTV gig. Perhaps it 
was his boyish good looks and charm, combined with his hard-edge outfits. 
Perhaps it was the fact that he is genuinely smart, a literature major and a 
musician who always manages to say something interesting about the videos he 
shows. For whatever reason, Lewin became a favorite of male audiences and the 
heartthrob of girls around the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "You are super handsome, and you're driving me totally and completely wild," a 
viewer wrote from Ecuador. 
</P>
<P>
 "Happiness of my days, light of my eyes, strength of my body, sweetness of 
life, that's what you are to me," another wrote from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like you way too much," said an Argentine who attached a photo with her 
request to meet him. 
</P>
<P>
 "ConeXion," with its broad spectrum of music, is largely responsible for 
Lewin's fame, but his hard-rock show, "Headbangers," is closer to his heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always connected with that music, since I was a child," he says. "With 
AC/DC, Black Sabbath, the bands I started listening to a long time ago, and 
which are the reason I got interested in music." 
</P>
<P>
 His story has a fairy-tale quality to it. A literature student at Santiago's 
Catholic University, he also sang in a hard rock band and hosted a late-night 
television rock show that was seen by MTV hostess Daisy Fuentes during a visit 
to Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minute I saw his face on TV, you could see a certain honesty, cuteness 
and hipness to Alfredo. I just had to let my producer know about him," Fuentes 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 Barely a month later, Lewin was called to be one of the three VJs who, with 
Fuentes, launched MTV Latino from Miami. He was an instant hit. 
</P>
<P>
 But his life hasn't been quite that easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewin's father died when he was 4. He lived with his mother and sister until 
he was 12, but things "didn't work out" and he left. After roaming from friend 
to friend, he found a home with a great-aunt, who took him in until she died. 
Lewin was 22, alone and penniless. Television was his saving grace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it out of necessity. . . . I needed a job, and (the local station) was 
having an audition." 
</P>
<P>
 He quickly became a local celebrity, and by the time MTV came along, he was 
ready. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want this to be the step to living my next 20 years with music, to say this 
is what I lived for and made my living from. I want to gain credibility, to go 
beyond being an image on the screen," Lewin says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to stop being a VJ until MTV is big, until its contribution goes 
beyond the music. . . . In seven years, I won't be the young VJ that gets all 
the fan mail. . . . But I do want people to say, 'Alfredo really knows about 
music.' "

RESIDENTS WANT COSTA MESA TO OUST 3 CHARITIES; HOMELESS: NEIGHBORS SEEK TO HAVE 
GROUPS' PERMITS REVOKED. THE CITY HAS ORGANIZED MEETINGS WITH A SOUP KITCHEN, 
ORANGE COAST INTERFAITH SHELTER AND SHARE OUR SELVES TO SEEK LONG-TERM 
SOLUTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Three of the city's most respected charities for the homeless are under attack 
by some residents, who contend the organizations and others are "magnets" for 
street people and want the city to revoke their permits to operate. 
</P>
<P>
 Citing thefts, car burglaries and acts of random violence by the homeless, the 
residents said they would like to see other cities share the burden of caring 
for Costa Mesa's estimated 1,500 street people. 
</P>
<P>
 "The City Council should bite the bullet on this one and take some of (the 
organizations') operating permits away," said Chris Steel, who ran 
unsuccessfully for the City Council in the Nov. 8 election. "They're the 
magnets, short and simple. And as long as they're here, the homeless are going 
to keep on coming." 
</P>
<P>
 Residents are directing their anger at Share Our Selves, which provides 
emergency financial funds and other aid to the homeless; the Someone Cares Soup 
Kitchen, which provides free lunches daily, and the Orange Coast Interfaith 
Shelter, which offers temporary housing. 
</P>
<P>
 All three are located in the Triangle Square area, near Newport Boulevard and 
19th Street, where the homeless often congregate and cause problems, according 
to residents and business owners who live and work in the area and have voiced 
their frustrations during City Council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Sandra L. Genis, however, said the homeless situation is not as dire as 
depicted by the residents, adding that she did not think removing Share Our 
Selves or any of the other charitable organizations from the city was the 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I do think the social service providers have some responsibility," she 
said. "They're just going to have to tell the people who are causing the 
problems that they should shape up or ship out or else they're not going to 
receive anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Social service providers say they are merely supplying the bare essentials -- 
food, clothing and shelter -- to those who need them. 
</P>
<P>
 "No place is ever going to be acceptable until the people come to a moral 
decision that serving them and helping them is OK," said Karen McGlinn, 
executive director of Share Our Selves. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no islands to put them on, no jails to house them in, no boxcars to 
ship them out of here," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Wenke, director of development for the Salvation Army in Orange County, 
said he cannot understand why anyone would want to get rid of any charitable 
organization, especially if it helps out as much as SOS, the soup kitchen or 
the Interfaith Shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the finest calls in life is to help the people who are down and out," 
he said. "We don't create hunger or homelessness, we just serve it. The fact 
is, it exists out there and it exists in big numbers." 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to address residents' concerns, the city has been holding monthly 
meetings with service providers during the past five months to find out who the 
homeless are, where they come from, whether they are putting the public at risk 
-- and to come up with possible solutions to the problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the homeless were invited to attend one of the meetings and were asked 
why they chose Costa Mesa over other cities in Orange County. The answer, 
according to McGlinn, was that the city was safer than others, the climate was 
perfect, and that food and shelter were available. 
</P>
<P>
 But some residents are angry that Costa Mesa has to play the host. They argue 
that all cities should bear the burden of taking care of the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be no more free lunches," said Linda Clark, emerging from this 
month's meeting with homeowners, the service providers and city officials. 
"People should work if they want to be fed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although Police Lt. Alan Kent said nuisance complaints, such as trespassing, 
drinking alcohol and urinating in public, have increased in the past six 
months, violent behavior among the homeless has not yet become a trend. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's mostly misdemeanor violations," he said. "We've stepped up enforcement 
to move them away from the area, but they (the homeless) keep moving in 
circles. We'll kick them out of Lion's Park, because it's against city 
ordinance to be there at night, but then they'll move to Wilson Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a handful of residents contend they have witnessed more violent 
behavior than they were accustomed to in years past, and they think the 
solution is kicking the charitable organizations out of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time that organizations such as Share Our Selves have 
come under fire. In 1990, for instance, SOS was forced to move its operations 
from the Rea Community Center, which it leased from the city, to its present 
office on Superior Street. 
</P>
<P>
 "But now we're located in an industrial part of town," McGlinn said. "We're 
not in the middle of a residential neighborhood like before." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcus Blackwell, a chemical dependency counselor for the Mental Health Assn. 
of Orange County, said it's just "a few bad apples" among the homeless who are 
causing the problems -- people who have been diagnosed as having a mental 
illness and are abusing some sort of drug. That makes communication with them 
all the more difficult, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "These people shouldn't even be in the streets," Blackwell said. "But the fact 
of the matter is, the mental institutions have closed down and have kicked them 
out, and they have no where else to go. Nobody else is there to take care of 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Gilbert, a Kansas City native who was once homeless and now volunteers 
at the Someone Cares Soup Kitchen, said the biggest misconception is that the 
homeless "are all bums and drunks." 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's the farthest from the truth," he said. "The truth is, a lot would 
like to get good steady jobs, but they can't. A lot of them have gone to the 
bottle and a lot of them haven't." 
</P>
<P>
 Others who work with street people believe the answer is finding a central 
location for Orange County's estimated 12,000 homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lonnie Ganbardella, a Vietnam veteran who helps the homeless at the soup 
kitchen, said one possible solution would be to use a part of El Toro or Tustin 
Marine Corps air stations, which are scheduled to close by the end of this 
decade, to house the homeless. 
</P>
<P>
 Kent suggests that the community -- the social service providers, the 
residents and the City Council -- work together to find long-term solutions. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a focused problem in the community and we're using a proactive 
approach," he said.

FASHIONING A FLEET OF FAST DREAMS; CRAFT: ONE OF THE NATION'S PREMIER MODEL 
MAKERS IS BUILDING A UNIQUE COLLECTION OF ALL THE AMERICA'S CUP WINNERS AND 
CHALLENGERS SINCE THE RACE BEGAN IN 1851. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID REYES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Several months ago, Ken Gardiner, a lanky craftsman with perennial sawdust in 
his hair, walked into a Connecticut maritime gallery in search of boat 
pictures. But not of just any boats. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarded as one of the top boat model makers in the United States, Gardiner, 
46, is in the midst of creating a collection ordered by Dennis Conner, 
America's best-known sailor, of every America's Cup challenger and defender 
since the trophy began in England in 1851. 
</P>
<P>
 When completed next June, the set, featuring 57 racing yachts built to a scale 
of 3/8 inch per foot, will be valued at about $1.2 million and placed for 
viewing at Conner's shop and gallery in San Diego. It will cap Gardiner's 
25-year model making career. 
</P>
<P>
 "No model maker has ever done the full collection in all the same scale," said 
Gardiner, who visited Connecticut's Mystic Maritime Gallery on a research foray 
for the Conner project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The New York Yacht Club has a collection, but they were made over the years 
by different model makers," he said. "But that's a private club, and the public 
can't see it. Dennis is going to have this on display in San Diego so the 
public can see it." 
</P>
<P>
 To a sailing purist like Conner, the New York collection and another owned by 
Australian model maker Rollie Tasker are flawed because they lacked consistency 
of model makers and scale. 
</P>
<P>
 "With regard to the scale," Conner said, "you miss the relative size of the 
boat. So my inspiration was to use a premier model maker. My dream was to build 
a complete set of defender and challenger boats by the same model maker, who 
was the best in the market, to a standard scale and a high standard of 
excellence." 
</P>
<P>
 Examples of Gardiner's work are usually found in abundance at Southern 
California marina offices, boat-building companies and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Rock, 45, the manager of Fiddler's Green Restaurant in San Diego, said: 
"He's the only person in the whole world that boat designers trust with their 
designs. Ken learned how to make models from his dad, and Ken lives and 
breathes boats." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardiner's boat models are carved from blocks of Michigan basswood, then 
sanded and coated with primer and paint at his Newport Beach factory, a 
workshop and warehouse filled with hundreds of wood and fiberglass hulls and 
materials wedged into a 1,000-square-foot area. 
</P>
<P>
 This world of boats includes a wood-carving room, painting booth, drying room 
and enough cubbyholes filled with handmade model parts to supply a miniature 
U.S. Navy. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It is a labor-intensive job with Gardiner and four employees putting in 
hundreds of painstaking hours to craft boats that are adorned with hand-laid 
teak decks, hand-machined screws, masts and winches. 
</P>
<P>
 Gardiner boats can sell for as little as $125 for a half-model of a hull to 
more than $17,000 for a full model. Half-models, preferred by most sailing 
traditionalists, offer a side profile of a boat's hull that is literally cut in 
half lengthwise, and mounted flush to a fine wood base. Full models are 
complete replicas. 
</P>
<P>
 For Gardiner, the trip to Connecticut yielded a treasure trove of information. 
</P>
<P>
 He had searched in sailing books, but none revealed enough details about the 
famous yachts he needed to build, including two, the Columbia and the Shamrock. 
At Mystic Seaport, he found rare photographs taken about 1899, the year the 
race was held, showing the Columbia at sail and the Shamrock during deck 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The photos gave him what he needed for an accurate model. 
</P>
<P>
 "Those two boats are over there," Gardiner said as he pointed during an 
interview inside his factory. On the deck of the Columbia, which was no wider 
than 10 inches, Gardiner had meticulously hand-laid 1/8-inch teak strips, and 
he readied the Shamrock for an authentic canvas-covered deck. 
</P>
<P>
 It is that attention to detail that has model makers like Gardiner in high 
demand. When customers arrive, they bring photographs, original boat drawings 
and their wallets. 
</P>
<P>
 He then lists every part, detailing, for example, whether a window is flush or 
recessed, cleats, literally every nut and bolt, even fishing poles -- all on a 
computer spreadsheet that usually goes to 12 pages. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a bidding list," he said. "From there we decide on the price and it 
usually takes from eight to 10 months to complete a full model. But right now 
I'm swamped, and we have a two-year backlog." 
</P>
<P>
 Prominent model makers are a rare breed who tend to specialize in Eastern 
Seaboard customers because there are more boats there than on the West Coast, 
said Scott Chambers, 45, a Seattle model maker and one of Gardiner's 
competitors. 
</P>
<P>
 By necessity, Chambers said, model makers are part engineer, part artist and 
part researcher. The ability to hunt for valuable information, "especially 
while working on full models, is part of the game." 
</P>
<P>
 "Ken and I go at it differently. I specialize in the half model and he does 
both," Chambers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Conner: "Ken is not only a model maker, but he is also a very competent 
sailor. I've raced with Kenny and against him for years. He really is the 
premier model maker." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though they have bid against each other, the two model craftsmen have never 
met. Gardiner does not advertise, in contrast to Chambers, who places ads in 
boating magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't advertise, and I don't like galleries," Gardiner said. "Galleries pay 
$10,000 and try to sell it for $20,000 when it's not a $20,000 model." 
</P>
<P>
 His client list includes prominent sailors like Conner and yacht designers, 
such as German Frers, and captains of industry. For the most part, Gardiner's 
business is individual models bought by those who can afford a 120-foot boat 
and also order its miniature equivalent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an ego thing," Gardiner explained. "They have their boat, and they can't 
put their boats in their offices or corporate headquarters. These are men and 
their water toys." 
</P>
<P>
 Gardiner has molds for more than 3,000 half-models and 160 full models. He has 
done so many of America's Cup boats that skippers and designers often buy 
dozens of the models to give to crew members and sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes we don't make the boats exactly," Gardiner admitted with a smile. 
"We use what I call the 'Kenny feel,' to complete the boat because in the 
America's Cup they don't want the (design) secret to come out. They do want me 
to make the boat, but they don't want anything that gives away the true design 
or any innovations." 
</P>
<P>
 One boat, a 120-foot motor sailer, had so much detail that it included fiber 
optic lights to illuminate the boat's interior. 
</P>
<P>
 "The customer was the head of an oil company who I can't name. But he was in 
the middle of a bad divorce," Gardiner recalled. "When he got it and unwrapped 
it, the owner slowly broke into a smile. His secretary later told me, 'You 
know, he hasn't smiled in the last year and a half. And, you made him smile.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of satisfaction motivates Gardiner. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's the biggest thrill, the customer's reaction," Gardiner said. "I love 
it. It's like winning a sailboat race. When you can see them smile . . . then 
you know you've won. And, I've been there when they open the shipping box and 
they can only say, 'Wow!' " Profile: Ken Gardiner

CONSULTANTS DODGED LAW, JUDGE IS TOLD; COURTS: ATTORNEY FOR DIRECT-MAIL EXPERTS 
DENIES ALLEGATIONS IN LAWSUIT, WHICH HAS BEEN CLOAKED IN MYSTERY. LAWYERS SAY 
THEY DON'T KNOW WHY DOCUMENTS WERE SEALED. 
</P>

<P>
 Two Newport Beach political consultants used an anti-tax group they helped 
start to dodge a required public accounting of roughly $19 million donated by 
Californians to political action committees and causes, an attorney charged 
Monday during opening statements in a civil lawsuit that has been mysteriously 
kept from public view since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the California Tax Reduction Movement became in practice is a most 
prolific goose who laid golden eggs," said Gary Phillips, the attorney for a 
Sherman Oaks man suing the consultants. "This (lawsuit) is about 
accountability." 
</P>
<P>
 On the opening day of the non-jury trial, Orange County Superior Court Judge 
Donald E. Smallwood -- addressing questions raised in The Times on Sunday -- 
asked attorneys in the case if they knew why or how more than 42 fat volumes of 
pleadings and other documents taken in the politically sensitive suit had been 
sealed from public view. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the attorneys professed to know how the suit -- which pits a shy, 
45-year-old accountant against powerful direct-mail gurus William Butcher and 
Arnold Forde -- had been shielded from public scrutiny for more than four 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly I don't understand why we've got anything under seal in this case," 
said Smallwood, at least the fifth judge to preside over the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Smallwood said it seemed "incongruous" to have under seal a case based 
entirely on alleged violations of the Political Reform Act of 1974 -- an act 
"designed to illuminate" political fund raising and other issues for the 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he declined to unseal the six filing cabinet drawers filled with 
documents already filed in connection with the suit, Smallwood said that all 
1,300 exhibits and the testimony to be offered during the scheduled five-week 
trial would be public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that transpires in this courtroom is going to be open to the 
public," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, attorneys from both sides laid the groundwork for their cases. 
Phillips, the attorney representing accountant Paul McCauley, delivered an 
opening statement about the case. David Elson, an attorney for Butcher, Forde 
and their consulting firm, and Lawrence Straw, an attorney for the California 
Tax Reduction Movement, or CTRM, offered their comments on the case in written 
trial briefs presented to Smallwood. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether CTRM (now known as the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Assn.) was a 
political action committee that should have been making regular public 
disclosures of where it was getting its money, and how it was being spent. Also 
contested is whether Butcher-Forde Consulting or BFC Direct Marketing, as their 
firm is known, was the "de facto" treasurer of CTRM, and therefore financially 
liable for what McCauley maintains are violations of the Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If CTRM is determined to be a political action committee subject to the 
Political Reform Act and Butcher-Forde is found to be financially liable, the 
defendants could be ordered to pay fines equaling the money that was spent and 
that should have been accounted for publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 McCauley contends that Butcher-Forde used CTRM to set up various political 
action committees that traded on the well-respected Howard Jarvis name. 
According to court documents filed by the plaintiff, the committees would raise 
money through mass mailings and then transfer much of the proceeds back to 
CTRM, which never publicly reported how the money was spent. 
</P>
<P>
 As their fees, Butcher and Forde arranged to be paid nearly half the money 
collected from Californians statewide to support such causes as the campaign to 
recall former Supreme Court Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, and another to Save 
Proposition 13, McCauley contends in court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the money not reported would end up in one place: Butcher-Forde 
Consulting's pocket," Phillips charged in his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Political Reform Act, "receipts and expenditures in election 
campaigns should be fully and truthfully disclosed in order that the voters may 
be fully informed and improper practices may be inhibited." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Elson didn't deny that his clients made a lot of money 
under their contract with CTRM. In fact, he said that "large amounts" of CTRM's 
expenditures "presumably got paid to Butcher-Forde Consulting." 
</P>
<P>
 According to federal income tax returns included in court documents, nearly 
half of the millions CTRM paid in two different years went to Butcher-Forde.  
</P>
<P>
 The records show that in 1985, half of the $6.9 million CTRM spent went to 
fund raising, and another nearly $2.5 million was paid to Butcher-Forde as 
fees. In 1986, Butcher-Forde's fees totaled $1.8 million, or 47% of the group's 
expenditures, court records state. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Elson stressed, the issue isn't whether or not his clients got rich, but 
whether they had control of CTRM's checkbook and, therefore, may be financially 
liable if CTRM made reporting violations under the Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the plaintiff's overblown -- and, for that matter, legally irrelevant 
-- claims is that CTRM was formed and operated as no more than a mere 
instrument for the BFC defendants' . . . own profit," Elson argued in the brief 
he submitted in lieu of an oral opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Elson said his clients could only be liable if they actually served as CTRM's 
campaign treasurer, and not because they served as CTRM's campaign manager and 
direct mail consultant. He also said McCauley's action could "chill 
participation in the political process" because active participants would fear 
people with "an ax to grind" could bring suit alleging campaign reporting 
violations. 
</P>
<P>
 In their briefs, Elson and Straw also argued that CTRM and the political 
action committees it spawned had checked with the Fair Political Practices 
Commission and had satisfied the FPPC's reporting requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "CTRM did receive surplus campaign funds from its sponsored committees," Straw 
wrote in his brief. "The transfer of these funds to CTRM was reported on the 
committees' campaign statements." 
</P>
<P>
 Argued Elson: "The FPPC never questioned the manner in which CTRM separated 
political receipts and expenditures from CTRM's other activities for public 
reporting purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's first witness was Trevor Grimm, former personal attorney of the late 
Howard Jarvis and general counsel of the Howard Jarvis Taxpayers Assn. Grimm 
testified that while Jarvis looked to Butcher and Forde for advice, he ran the 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimm said any payment Butcher-Forde received was approved by Jarvis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that Howard Jarvis was elated with the progress of the organization," 
Grimm said. "To that extent, I assume that's why they got what they got. He 
thought Butcher was a genius. . . . He thought they were worth it."

JUDGE TELLS CHARITY SOLICITOR TO ACCOUNT FOR MONEY; COURTS: TENTATIVE DECISION 
WOULD BAR FURTHER FUND RAISING UNTIL $3 MILLION TO $6 MILLION IN DONATIONS CAN 
BE TRACED. DEPUTY ATTORNEY GENERAL CONTENDS THAT MORE THAN 90% WENT TO PAY 
DEFENDANTS' FEES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge has tentatively barred an Irvine fund-raiser and 
several associates from soliciting charitable donations in the state until they 
account for millions of dollars raised since 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Robert A. Knox, in a tentative decision issued last week, gave Mitchell 
Gold and his associates 120 days to account for an estimated $3 million to $6 
million raised with the promise that the money would be used for specific 
charities, such as granting the wishes of dying veterans. The judge also 
ordered the defendants to pay $6,000 for each day that they exceed his 
deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 In recent court documents, Deputy Atty. Gen. H. Chester Horn alleges Gold and 
his associates raised more than $15 million by "misleading those donors into 
believing that the funds were being raised for a variety of charitable purposes 
when, in fact, more than 90% of all the funds were used to pay the defendants' 
fund-raising fees." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers for the defendants, however, have argued among other things in recent 
court documents that there is a "clear dispute as to the obligations of 
commercial fund-raisers." 
</P>
<P>
 Horn on Monday called the judge's tentative decision a "very important step" 
in a case that has been described as one of the largest involving allegations 
of charity fraud in California. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you call people on the telephone and make representation to them to get 
them to donate money for charity, you better be telling the truth," Horn said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, which came following a nine-day court trial in August, should 
become final in about a week, Horn said. The defendants, including two 
companies owned by Gold, Orange County Charitable Services and North American 
Funding Corps., could be fined and ordered to pay money back to the charities, 
depending on what the accounting reveals, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers representing Gold and his associates could not be reached for comment 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In a previous interview with The Times, Gold denied allegations of wrongdoing 
and said he was an honest businessman who was being "harassed" by the attorney 
general's office, which initiated the lawsuit in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the tentative decision, the judge fined Gold and his companies 
$1,000 after finding them in contempt of court for ignoring a previous 
preliminary injunction ordering them to account for the $3 million to $6 
million.  
</P>
<P>
 The tentative decision also would allow the state to try to recoup from the 
defendants an estimated $300,000 in prosecution costs, Horn said.

 Despite some close races, there were no surprise winners Monday when the 
county Registrar of Voters released the official election results. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, after the absentee votes were counted from the Nov. 8 elections, 
three city council candidates in Buena Park, Newport Beach and Santa Ana were 
ousted from their lead positions. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates involved in those council races anxiously waiting for the 
provisional ballots to be tallied to complete the final election results. 
</P>
<P>
 For candidate Larry Wieck, who lost his bid for the Buena Park City Council, 
the wait was nerve-racking because the race came down to the wire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Four years ago the results came in a lot faster," said Wieck who ran this 
year and four years ago for the council. "When it's this close it takes a lot 
of commitment and courage to continue with your daily life." 
</P>
<P>
 Wieck's race remained close with only an 18-vote gap between him and the 
winning candidate, Arthur C. Brown, who was reelected to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Larry Wieck did an outstanding job of campaigning, and if he had just 
gotten a few more votes he would have been on the council," said Brown, who is 
confident in his slim victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the results will remain the same whether there's a recount or not 
because the margin has been getting wider with each count," Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown was ahead last week by 10 votes after the absentee ballots were counted. 
</P>
<P>
 In another close race in Santa Ana, Tony Espinoza won his council seat by 332 
votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely happy with the results," said Espinoza. "What I want to do now 
is build the bridges between people of all ethnic backgrounds in the city and 
make it a better place to work and live." 
</P>
<P>
 The third council race in Newport Beach was won by Thomas C. Edwards by a 
margin of 599 votes over Ron Winship. YVETTE CABRERA

 Three of the city's economic specialists will lose their jobs today if, as 
expected, the City Council approves a shake-up of redevelopment offices. 
</P>
<P>
 The job cuts will save the city $250,000 in salaries and benefits and be a 
step in fulfilling the city manager's goal of creating a "leaner and smaller" 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a philosophy to try to do more with less," City Manager David F. Dixon 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan calls for the nine-member redevelopment division -- now part of the 
Planning Department -- to dissolve. The new Economic Development Department 
will take its place with a staff of six and expand its focus beyond 
redevelopment projects. 
</P>
<P>
 David K. McElroy, the head of the new department, said his recruitment earlier 
this month signaled the changes at City Hall. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really is a philosophical change," McElroy said. "Redevelopment is 
eliminating slums and blight. Economic development is more along the lines of 
retaining and attracting jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon said he has envisioned that change since coming to Orange last February. 
"When I first came, I had had a different perspective to not just look at 
redevelopment," he said. "I thought economic development should be citywide." 
</P>
<P>
 Dixon added that the mission he was hired to accomplish is three-fold: recruit 
new job-creating industries, retain current businesses and nurture an expansion 
of both. 
</P>
<P>
 The city went through a major overhaul early in 1993, when more than 100 jobs 
were eliminated through attrition or layoffs in all departments -- except 
police and fire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our position on the council is that we support the city manager and his 
ongoing restructuring efforts, even though there are some sad occasions when 
employees have to depart," Councilman Mike Spurgeon said. "We're doing 
everything we can to assist those people." 
</P>
<P>
 The council will vote on the matter during its 4:30 p.m. session in City Hall 
at 300 E. Chapman Ave. LESLEY WRIGHT

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: SADDLEBACK / SOUTH BEACH; LAGUNA BEACH; ARTIST MAKES MARK 
WITH FLAMING FISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As a student at Mission Viejo High School, Todd Guevara drew flames on his 
notebook. He envisioned fire dancing on motorcycle gas tanks, cars, airplanes 
and more. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the 29-year-old Guevara applies his passion for flames to Fiberglas 
fish, which look like the oceanic version of hot-rod cars. His colorful designs 
grace everything from marlins to big-mouth bass. 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara, a former art dealer in Los Angeles and Orange counties, is expanding 
his line to include manta rays. He has already honed his craft on lifelike 
shapes of barracudas, sharks, marlins and sailfish. 
</P>
<P>
 "The flames burn as if the fish was flying through the air," Guevara said. 
"People say, 'You should do an octopus,' but I just don't see the dynamic." 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara said he was attracted to fish because of their aerodynamics. He said 
he studied the shapes of fish when skin diving in Mexico and Hawaii. He also 
made a few visits to Sea World. 
</P>
<P>
 His first project -- a sailfish -- he did for himself. After friends saw it, 
they wanted something similar, Guevara said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I jumped into this and did a few," he said of his early work. "They got 
better as time went on." 
</P>
<P>
 And more popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for Guevara's art range from $500 to $4,800. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the work is done in a shop where the foam is first shaped, then coated 
with Fiberglas before being sanded to a slick finish. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the real thing, Guevara's completed projects bear no gaff marks or 
other imperfections. Surfaces are as glassy as a 1957 Chevy in showroom 
condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Guevara said some people have misinterpreted his interest in flames. He paints 
water drops on Fiberglas dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not into real fire," Guevara said. "I'm just into the art of fire." --

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FEEDBACK SOUGHT ON CARGO FLIGHT PROPOSAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to allow commercial cargo operations at John Wayne Airport will 
face another hurdle today when the Orange County Planning Commission seeks 
public comments on the adequacy of an environmental impact report. 
</P>
<P>
 The study, prepared by the county Environmental Management Agency, assesses 
requests to fly cargo flights from the airport by United Parcel Service and 
Federal Express.The companies are each proposing one flight per day, Monday 
through Friday, from the airport to their sorting centers. 
</P>
<P>
 The cargo aircraft would be Boeing 757-200s and Airbus A-310s.  
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors will consider the request at its Dec. 6 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the proposal's opponents is the city of Newport Beach, which retained 
two law firms to help prevent the cargo flights. City officials fear that 
allowing the flights would open the door to negating a hard-won 1985 settlement 
of a lawsuit about airport noise. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that agreement and a 1990 county access plan, no more than 73 
noise-regulated aircraft may depart from the airport each day. All of those 
flights currently are allotted to passenger carriers, in part because of a 
provision in the plan giving preference to aircraft with 75 or more seats. 
</P>
<P>
 If the county approves cargo operations at John Wayne Airport, Newport Beach 
officials are concerned that two of the 73 daily flight slots would be switched 
to United Parcel Service and Federal Express. That could prompt passenger 
airlines to sue to get their flights back, officials fear. 
</P>
<P>
 The Planning Commission hearing is scheduled for 1:30 p.m. at the Hall of 
Administration Building, 10 Civic Center Plaza, Santa Ana. ALAN EYERLY

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; RULING ON ARREST WARRANTS APPEALED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court was asked Monday to consider last month's state 
appellate court ruling upholding the validity of arrest warrants issued by 
court clerks against traffic offenders who fail to show up for hearings.  
</P>
<P>
 The case is being appealed by Kurt Albert Stapf, a Laguna Niguel resident who 
had paid nearly $2,000 in fines for failing to appear five times in court and 
for motorcycle speeding tickets. 
</P>
<P>
 Staph contends that state law allowing clerks to issue complaints for failure 
to appear is unconstitutional because it gives powers to court clerks that are 
reserved for prosecutors.  
</P>
<P>
 But last month, the 4th District Court of Appeal in Santa Ana reversed an 
earlier judgment by the county's Superior Court that sided with Staph, and thus 
paved the way for the county to reissue arrest warrants for more than 100,000 
traffic offenders who failed to appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
 But attorneys who opposed the court's decision contended that the 
three-justice state panel based its decision on practical concerns, not the 
Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 John R. Farris Jr., one of Staph's lawyers, said he expects to learn within 60 
days whether the state's highest court will hear the case or let the Court of 
Appeal ruling remain as a statewide precedent. 
</P>
<P>
 Lon Watson, assistant Orange County counsel representing the county's 
municipal courts, said that in view of the appellate court ruling, he sees no 
reason why the court clerks should stop issuing complaints or postpone 
collecting fines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our advice to the courts would be to continue to do what the law authorizes 
you to do until a higher court tells you not to," he said. LESLIE BERKMAN

<P>
 Supporters of the Santa Ana Zoo are being asked to help "Pave the Way" for 
improvements at the new Rain Forest Conservation Exhibit by painting 
animal-related designs on tiles that will be permanently displayed near the 
exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo will supply the 12-by-12-inch blank tiles, paints and kiln firing for 
a $100 contribution.Proceeds will pay for seating and educational displays 
adjacent to the ecology-themed exhibit. 
</P>
<P>
 Leading the fund-raising effort is the Friends of Santa Ana Zoo. The support 
group conducted a similar tile-painting project last year to help pay for the 
Amazon's Edge exhibit of South American animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The zoo, at 1801 E. Chestnut Ave. in Santa Ana's Prentice Park, is open from 
10 a.m. to 4 p.m. daily.

ENGLISH SKILLS

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Once they take office Dec. 6, the two new school board members in the Garden 
Grove Unified School District may help speed the learning of English as a 
second language. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Cantrell and Bob Harden were the top vote-getters among seven 
candidates, beating out incumbents Dick Hain and Frank E. Noe. 
</P>
<P>
 Harden, 38, said that he will strive to improve students' academic 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that the district can do a little better," he said. "Terry and I 
both campaigned on the fact that the district scores next to last in the county 
on SATs. We want to take a long look at academic standards and performance of 
the district and see what we can do to improve." 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell, 41, praised staff and administrators but said the district must do 
more to speed the rate at which limited English-speaking students learn the 
language. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have seen fourth- and fifth-grade students who are far behind and not 
(able) to read," he said. "I don't see why we can't guarantee a higher success 
rate among our students." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Slimmer, a longtime board member, said he expected the new and current 
trustees "won't have any problem working together. Everyone seems in a high 
spirit of cooperation." JON NALICK

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NORTH; ANAHEIM; TB-TESTING REQUIREMENT OBSERVED AT 
SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Anthony Walker wasn't sure how it would feel to have a nurse prick his skin 
for a tuberculosis test, but he wasn't taking any chances. 
</P>
<P>
 As Anthony watched Kathy Prater slip a needle under the skin on his sister's 
forearm, the first-grader at Mattie Lou Maxwell Elementary School started 
screaming. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony, 6, was one of several who protested getting the test Monday as 
several hundred Magnolia School District kindergartners, first-graders and 
other new students attended a free TB screening clinic held at Dr. Albert 
Schweitzer Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 The clinic, sponsored by Martin Luther Hospital, was prompted by a newly 
enacted county requirement that all students new to a school in the county must 
be tested for TB. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there have been no reported active TB cases in the Magnolia district, 
officials wanted to make it easy for new students to be tested. 
</P>
<P>
 "Parents aren't always able to get to the one clinic in the county were these 
tests are offered," said Frances Jolly, district assistant superintendent. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike previous TB tests that used a small, four-pronged device to inject 
small amounts of a culture extracted from the TB virus, the test now required 
involves injecting the culture under the skin with a needle.  
</P>
<P>
 The new tests, called the Mantoux method, must be read by a trained health 
care provider to determine if the child has a reaction that would indicate 
exposure to the TB virus. Previously, parents examined the site to determine if 
there was a reaction. 
</P>
<P>
 "This method is much more reliable," said Dr. Frances Xavier, a pediatrician 
on hand to supervise the clinic. "And having a nurse read the test is crucial."

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: LA HABRA; COUNCIL PUTS TEETH IN CURFEW ORDINANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an attempt to deter juvenile delinquency, the City Council has toughened an 
ordinance that imposes a citywide 10 p.m. curfew on minors. 
</P>
<P>
 Under an amended law council members adopted last week, parents of anyone 
younger than 18 who is out between 10 p.m. and 5 a.m. can be fined $40. 
</P>
<P>
 La Habra has had the curfew ordinance in place since 1945, but police never 
enforced it, according to Capt. John Rees and City Manager Lee Risner. 
</P>
<P>
 Now police can make parents pay for their children's misbehavior, Rees said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first time we see junior (out past curfew), we make mom and dad aware of 
the situation by giving them a pamphlet explaining the whole thing," he said, 
adding that police will hold minors at the scene, or take them home or to the 
Police Department to release them to their parents or guardian. "The second 
time we catch junior or juniorette, mommy and daddy are responsible for (a 
portion of) our cost." 
</P>
<P>
 Some youths Monday reacted negatively to word of the ordinance, saying it 
takes away their right to "hang out" with friends. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think (the city is) trying to do something about the problem with kids 
causing trouble at night," said Melissa Huckeba, 16, a junior at La Habra High 
School. "But a lot of kids don't have money and the way we have fun is by 
hanging out and talking. Why should we or our parents be punished for doing 
something that isn't even wrong?" 
</P>
<P>
 Not all minors who break curfew will be punished, however. 
</P>
<P>
 Rees said those who are on the streets because they are on their way home or 
to the store or running an errand for their parents will not be cited. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, we wanted to make it unlawful for a kid to be out late at night 
doing nothing -- just hanging out," he said. MIMI KO

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT / COSTA MESA / IRVINE; IRVINE; COLLEGE SPARKED TO 
ACTION BY PROP. 187 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The passage of Proposition 187 has sparked a rare burst of political activism 
at the usually sleepy Irvine Valley College campus. Student groups from 
colleges throughout Orange County are expected to take part in a Proposition 
187 "teach-in" beginning at noon today on campus. 
</P>
<P>
 Educators, students and Latino activists will gather at the student services 
courtyard on campus to learn about and discuss the law, which denies social 
services and public education to illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an opportunity for the students on this campus to express 
themselves," said Francisco Marmolejo, an Irvine Valley College history 
professor scheduled to speak at today's event. "That often doesn't happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The teach-in was the idea of Irvine Valley College student Catherine Reinke, 
25, a Korean American nursing student who works as a pharmacy technician at 
Western Medical Center-Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a large number of Latino workers at the hospital. After Proposition 
187 passed, I couldn't look at their faces, I felt so guilty and so awful," 
Reinke said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinke came to the United States at age 12 from Seoul, South Korea. She says 
she identifies with the plight of illegal immigrants because of the struggles 
of her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 Marmolejo was the first member of his family born in the United States. His 
parents immigrated to the United States 45 years ago from Mexico. He believes 
Proposition 187 will be struck down by the courts, but he sees an increase in 
racial tensions caused by the ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has created a sort of mean-spiritedness and a hard-heartedness," Marmolejo 
said. "People are being hurt on both sides of this issue." RUSS LOAR

<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials are bidding to provide lifeguard services to neighboring Sunset 
Beach, where a five-year contract with a private lifeguard company is due to 
expire in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Seal Beach Parks and Recreation Director Andy Seymour said the city can save 
money on lifeguard services by extending the use of city personnel and 
equipment to Sunset Beach, an unincorporated area separated from city beaches 
by the Naval Weapons Station. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is bidding against U.S. Ocean Safety, a Laguna Beach company 
currently hired by the county Environmental Management Agency to provide 
lifeguard service at Sunset Beach. Another unidentified company is also bidding 
for the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you are the neighboring city, you are immediately available, and back-up 
assistance is also immediately available," said Seymour, a Seal Beach lifeguard 
for 20 years before he became parks and recreation director. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's rescue boat could easily serve both beaches, Seymour said, which 
would save the city half the cost of its operations. He said the city could 
also share some of the lifeguards who staff nine lifeguard stations in Seal 
Beach in the summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of U.S. Ocean Safety could not be reached for comment, but 
Seymour said the company has a good reputation. The company is seeking higher 
wages for its Sunset Beach lifeguards, who receive the lowest pay of all county 
lifeguards, except those in Laguna Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 A decision on the lifeguard contract is expected by the end of the year.RUSS

COMMUNITY NEWS FOCUS: NEWPORT / COSTA MESA / IRVINE; NEWPORT BEACH; $120,000 
ALLOCATED FOR PARK DEVELOPMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has earmarked $120,000 to plan and design several parks, but 
another $1.2 million for actual park construction remains to be allocated. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's appropriation calls for $50,000 to plan community and view parks 
citywide, to be built with assessment district funds, and $70,000 to design 
Upper Castaways Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The park will be built on about 4 3/4 acres next to the Upper Castaways gated 
community for which the Irvine Co. received Planning Commission approval 
Thursday. It is slated to include two baseball diamonds, soccer fields, 
restrooms and a parking area. 
</P>
<P>
 The development will be a 119-home community off Dover Drive. The Irvine Co. 
has agreed to donate about 30 1/2 acres of parkland in that area to the city. 
Some will be kept in a natural state, and some will be used for a view park. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the parks comes from in-lieu park fees paid by developers when 
their land is subdivided. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has 11 park service areas, and the parks must be built or improved in 
the same area as the development for which fees are paid. However, site 
designations may be transferred from one area to another depending on need. 
</P>
<P>
 Community parks are those with recreational facilities such as courts, 
playgrounds and community buildings. View parks are smaller areas with fewer 
improvements, generally constructed on the edge of a development to preserve 
open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The council delayed a decision on spending the park construction funds pending 
a review of development priorities. HOLLY J. WAGNER

 Members of community groups seeking federal grants for programs that serve 
low-income areas of the city expressed frustration during a meeting recently at 
the red tape involved. 
</P>
<P>
 The comments came last week as the City Council approved about $448,000 in 
requests for federal Community Development Block Grant funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Even when the city approves the applications, however, funding is far from 
assured and takes an average of 18 months to reach the people who will use it, 
city officials said.

 "Anything approved here tonight, and that gets approved at the county and 
federal levels, will probably not get funding until February, 1996," City 
Manager Bob D'Amato told the applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 That news left community groups frustrated. 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Luna, who works with youths at the Cathy Torrez Learning Center, said he's 
waiting for money to keep the center open at night for a basketball program to 
keep young people off the streets. 
</P>
<P>
 He told the council that applicants "lose their enthusiasm over time" while 
they wait for the money. 
</P>
<P>
 The city typically receives $150,000 to $250,000 a year in grant funds. The 
county will make recommendations from the list approved by the council and the 
federal government will have final say on who gets funds. HOLLY J. WAGNER

SCHOOL SITE REPORT UNUSUAL, OFFICIAL SAYS; EDUCATION: ADMINISTRATOR SAYS 
DOCUMENT CRITICAL OF SANTA ANA'S PLANNED 'SPACE-SAVER' CAMPUS HOLDS DISTRICT TO 
A RIGOROUS AND UNPRECEDENTED STANDARD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 A state official who has overseen the purchase of hundreds of school sites 
said Monday that a sharply critical report by his agency's real estate expert 
on Santa Ana's planned "space-saver" school is highly unusual and holds the 
school district to a new standard. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had other sites where the Office of Local Assistance real estate unit 
looked into it very closely, but not to this extent. This one seems to be more 
(thorough) than any other before it," said Lyle A. Smoot, administrator for the 
seven-member State Allocation Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's too bad that Santa Ana has to be the test case, because they've got 
enough problems as it is. This is just one more thing that gets in the way of 
having a school built." 
</P>
<P>
 The innovative project, which would tap state funds to build a vertical school 
at the Bristol MarketPlace shopping center, has been plagued by criticism from 
some residents and several school board members, who say the school district 
didn't adequately consider cheaper sites.  
</P>
<P>
 Critics also have blasted the school district's plan to compensate the 
developer for the cost of relocating two businesses there.  
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Local Assistance report, received by school district officials 
Monday but detailed in press accounts over the weekend, says that three 
appraisals of the Bristol Street property ordered by the school district are 
inadequate because they don't take into account soil contamination from gas 
tanks once buried at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The report recommends denial of those appraisals, and that a fourth appraisal 
be obtained under the direction of Office of Local Assistance staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Smoot said the Allocation Board deals with contamination from buried gas tanks 
"all the time" and has never required that contamination be taken into account 
in the initial appraisals. Usually, Smoot said, the land is appraised and then 
it is determined how much a cleanup will cost and who will pay for it. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also states that cheaper sites are available to the school 
district, and that by using state money to compensate the developer for 
relocating the two demolished businesses, the Allocation Board's actions could 
be misconstrued as "a gift of public funds." 
</P>
<P>
 Smoot said the report, authored in part by Frank Harding, deputy local 
assistance officer for real estate, came as a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was only a few weeks ago that I found out that Frank Harding had such a 
problem with this site and was going to dedicate so much time to these issues," 
Smoot said. "I don't see the necessity for this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Office of Local Assistance is the administrative arm of the Allocation 
Board. Harding could not be reached for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The report also states that Office of Local Assistance staff believes crews 
first analyzing contamination at the site bored too deeply and "carried the 
tank contamination down into the existing aquifer." 
</P>
<P>
 The property owner, Scott Bell of Interstate Consolidated Industries, said the 
contamination was first discovered in 1989 and is limited to a contained area 
of about one acre. The contamination lies beneath the Montgomery Ward 
automotive center, which would be razed and relocated to make way for a staff 
parking lot for the school, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bell said that Montgomery Ward has agreed to pay to clean the contaminated 
soil, and that he had no knowledge of crews ever causing contamination to 
spread to an aquifer. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials Monday also lashed out at the report, saying they believed a 
meeting with the report's authors two weeks ago had addressed the key concerns. 
 
</P>
<P>
 School board member Rob Balen said that for six months the Office of Local 
Assistance has been sitting on reports that detail soil contamination at the 
proposed school site, and should have raised the concerns earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 "To spring these issues on us at the last minute when the state has had these 
reports in their hands for months and months is totally unfair," Balen said.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems to me that they're trying to find reasons to recommend against the 
project. Every reason they have come up with has been addressed. There is some 
kind of posturing going on with this, and we're caught in the middle."

FAMILY SUES ST. JOSEPH HOSPITAL OVER PATIENT'S DEATH; LITIGATION: LONGTIME 
SALVATION ARMY OFFICIAL STRANGLED ON A CHEST RESTRAINING DEVICE WHILE 
HOSPITALIZED FOR A STROKE, HIS CHILDREN CHARGE. OFFICIALS DECLINE COMMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The children of a longtime Salvation Army official sued St. Joseph Hospital on 
Monday, alleging their father strangled on a chest restraining device while 
trying to climb out of bed. 
</P>
<P>
 The daughter and two sons of Arthur L. Carl Sr. allege in the lawsuit, filed 
Monday in Orange County Superior Court, that the Orange hospital and its 
transitional care unit were negligent in treating the 83-year-old stroke 
patient and tried to cover up the cause of his death. 
</P>
<P>
 "This gentleman was a lieutenant colonel in the Salvation Army and had given 
his whole life to charity work," said attorney Frank P. Barbaro, who is 
representing C. Jane Carl, Richard Carl and Arthur Carl Jr. in the lawsuit. "To 
die like that is really sad." 
</P>
<P>
 Hospital officials declined comment, saying company policy prohibits them from 
speaking about pending lawsuits. In addition to the hospital and the 
transitional care unit, the suit names Dr. Richard Dauben and Dr. Jack O. 
Stewart as defendants. 
</P>
<P>
 Carl, a longtime Santa Ana resident, suffered a stroke March 26 and was 
admitted to the hospital, where he spent several days in the intensive care 
unit, Barbaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 While at the hospital he became agitated and confused, and doctors gave him 
medication to calm him. They also used chest and ankle restraints to keep him 
from climbing out of bed, Barbaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 About four hours before his death early on March 31, medical officials 
transferred Carl from the hospital to the transitional care unit, where he was 
to receive rehabilitative therapy, Barbaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family alleges in the lawsuit that medical staff in the transitional 
center stopped giving Carl the medication that would have calmed him down and 
used only a chest restraining device, known as a Posey vest. The family further 
alleges that medical staff failed to properly watch Carl, which allowed him the 
chance to try to climb out of bed, causing him to become tangled in the Posey 
vest. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbaro said a March 31 autopsy report from the Orange County coroner's office 
says the cause of Carl's death was "positional asphyxiation, due to hospital 
restraint (Posey vest)." 
</P>
<P>
 The family, however, alleges in the lawsuit that they were led to believe 
their father died of "natural consequences" and that he was found dead, 
"sitting next to the side of the bed with the Posey vest still attached. . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
 "The family was never told, nor do the medical records reflect, how he really 
died," Barbaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 The family is seeking an unspecified amount of damages in the case.

FATHER TO BE ARRAIGNED IN 'SHAKEN BABY' CASE, POLICE SAY; CRIME: FELONY CHARGES 
MAY BE FILED AGAINST BUENA PARK MAN TODAY, AUTHORITIES SAY. THE 6-WEEK-OLD 
INFANT REMAINS IN CRITICAL CONDITION BUT IS EXPECTED TO SURVIVE.

 A 6-week-old remained in critical condition with brain damage Monday, and his 
father, Juan Carlos Rivera of Buena Park, was expected to face charges today 
that he shook the baby nearly to death. 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera, 20, was arrested Saturday after paramedics were summoned to the 7400 
block of Iroquois Drive on a call that his infant boy was experiencing 
seizures, police said. Both parents were present at the time of the incident, 
Sgt. Bob Chaney said. 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors at Children's Hospital of Orange County determined that the child, 
Christian Valdez, had been violently shaken and had suffered brain damage, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The baby remained on life support systems Monday, but his chances of survival 
appeared good, said Dr. Sana Al-Jundi, a member of the hospital team in charge 
of the case. The extent of irreversible brain damage remains unknown, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The brain is still in its development stages," she said, "so we really don't 
know the extent of damages until the child reaches that development milestone 
at about 4 months old." 
</P>
<P>
 At that age, physicians can measure the accomplishments of the child against 
the standard development of other children, Al-Jundi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Preliminary examinations revealed that the infant had suffered from "shaken 
baby syndrome," where the developing connective tissues of a newborn are 
damaged internally due to traumatic forces, Al-Jundi said. The torn tissues 
cause a range of injuries, from severe bleeding of the brain to blindness. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that these injuries could not have resulted from something like a 
fall because there were no external signs," Al-Jundi said. "There were no 
bruises, no scratches." 
</P>
<P>
 Doctors also see indications that both legs may have been fractured, but need 
to do additional tests to confirm that, she said. The seizures, she said, 
probably happened within 24 hours of the trauma. 
</P>
<P>
 "We get these 'shaken baby' cases every once in a while," Al-Jundi said. "And 
it's hard to deal with every time." 
</P>
<P>
 Rivera remained in the city jail in lieu of $100,000 bail. He is expected to 
be arraigned today on felony child abuse charges, Chaney said.

PROPERTY VALUES: PROGRAM HELPS TURN RENTERS INTO HOMEOWNERS; REBUILDING: THE 
CALIFORNIA HOUSING FINANCING AGENCY OFFERS SPECIAL LOANS TO CERTAIN EARTHQUAKE 
VICTIMS.

 The January earthquake wasn't all bad for Bruce and Ellen Mirovich. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple had the misfortune of losing many personal belongings and they had 
to move out of their Simi Valley apartment, which was yellow-tagged by city 
officials. With the help of a state-sponsored program, however, the Miroviches 
are property owners instead of renters. Through the California Housing 
Financing Agency, the couple moved to Moorpark in September to a buy a 
brand-new $129,500 condo with no money down and financed for 30 years at a 
fixed interest rate of just 5.95%. 
</P>
<P>
 While the Miroviches did need to come up with about $3,000 in closing costs, 
the $1,075 monthly payment on their condo is only $25 a month more than they 
were paying as renters in Simi Valley. Allowing for tax benefits, the couple 
will actually be paying less to own than to rent. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been married for 22 years and we've always been renters," Bruce 
Mirovich said. "Becoming homeowners has been a major change in our lives." 
</P>
<P>
 The Miroviches made use of a little-known state-sponsored program that 
provides low-interest and low down payment loans to certain individuals and 
families who suffered damage as a result of the Northridge earthquake. "We've 
tried to inform the public, but it's amazing how many people don't know we're 
here and what we offer," said Jeannie Buchanan, spokeswoman for the California 
Housing Finance Agency in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 CHFA's earthquake-related loans were announced in the spring but most 
borrowers never learned about them, said John Lucas, vice president and branch 
manager at ARCS Mortgage Inc. in Van Nuys. ARCS has funded more than 30 CHFA 
earthquake loans, but only recently have would-be borrowers started really 
getting interested in the program. "It's been the forgotten loan program," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to CHFA, there is $75 million set aside for earthquake-related loans 
for renters. Only one-third of that money has been committed to loans so far, 
however. That leaves about $50 million in unused funds, Buchanan said. The 
agency said it will probably close out the quake loan program by the first 
anniversary of the Northridge quake Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 CHFA uses mortgage revenue bonds to buy loans from lenders statewide. Lenders 
approved by CHFA are able to offer special terms to buyers who have suffered 
earthquake damage, who are of moderate income or who are buying a so-called 
target area that has been identified by the federal government as needing 
assistance. "There are a whole bunch of wrinkles to these things," Buchanan 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are several possible ways to tap into the CHFA program: 
</P>
<P>
 * First-time home buyers who were renters during the earthquake may qualify 
for a CHFA loan if they can document serious damage to their rented premises, 
or if their rented home or apartment was red- or yellow-tagged in the aftermath 
of the earthquake. It's worth noting that first-time home buyers are defined as 
renters who haven't owned a home in the last three years, but they don't 
actually have to be first-time buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are income limits to keep in mind. A family in Los Angeles County of 
one or two people can't earn more than $55,700 and qualify for a CHFA loan; 
families of three or more can make up to $64,500 and still qualify. The income 
limits in Ventura County are higher, especially for borrowers who want to buy a 
home in a target area. 
</P>
<P>
 There are also purchase price limitations, based on the county where the 
residence is being purchased and whether the home is newly built or a resale. 
Existing homes in non-target areas in Los Angeles County, for example, have a 
maximum purchase price of $196,200. 
</P>
<P>
 * Owners or renters who can document that their premises were damaged in the 
earthquake may also qualify for a CHFA loan if they are looking to buy in a 
target area. In the San Fernando Valley, target areas include parts of Pacoima, 
North Hollywood, Panorama City, Van Nuys and Arleta, among others. Because the 
target areas may only cover certain blocks, it's best to check with a lender to 
find out more specifics. Certain other income and purchase price limitations 
also apply. 
</P>
<P>
 * Borrowers can apply for a CHFA loan under either Federal Housing 
Administration, Veterans Administration or conventional CHFA guidelines. Each 
application method has its own underwriting and insurance guidelines. CHFA 
basically acts as the investor in these loans and the insurer is either the 
FHA, VA or the California Housing Insurance Fund (the state agency that insures 
conventional CHFA loans). 
</P>
<P>
 Borrowers who opt for a CHFA loan insured by FHA must pay up-front 2.25% 
(although this can be financed as part of the loan) of the purchase price, and 
another 0.5% per month for FHA's mutual mortgage insurance. VA-insured loans 
require a 2% of the purchase price funding fee but no monthly add-on. 
Conventional CHFA loans are generally limited to a 95% loan-to-purchase price, 
with a 0.55% monthly insurance payment. Note that all CHFA loans have some sort 
of income and purchase limitations. Also, all CHFA loans require that 1% of the 
loan be paid as a fee to the loan originator, or lender. 
</P>
<P>
 * People who owned homes damaged in the earthquake may also qualify for a CHFA 
loan if they buy a replacement residence in a targeted area. Various 
restrictions apply. 
</P>
<P>
 The CHFA also has a list of approved lenders that is available to would-be 
borrowers. 
</P>
<P>

O.C. JOBLESS RATE TAKES PLUNGE; LOWEST SINCE '91; ECONOMY: OCTOBER'S RATE IS 
5.1%, DOWN SHARPLY FROM 7% A YEAR AGO. ANALYSTS DECLARE END OF LOCAL SLUMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Orange County's jobless rate plunged in October to 5.1%, the lowest level in 
nearly three years and down sharply from 7% a year ago, the state's Employment 
Development Department reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by gains in the services sector, the county's economy added 4,800 
payroll jobs last month from September, when the jobless rate was 6%. The news 
prompted analysts to declare that the local economy has finally shaken off its 
long slump. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we are signaling an expansion," said Esmael Adibi, 
director of the Center for Economic Research at Chapman University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of unemployed in the county fell by 14%, to 68,800. And October 
marked the county's first year-to-year gain in payroll jobs since early 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 While Orange County continues to take its hits in aerospace and other 
manufacturing industries, it has seen gains in such diverse areas such as 
apparel, health care and international trade. Its jobless rate is now the 
lowest since December, 1991, when it reached 4.8% before beginning a steady 
climb during the recession. 
</P>
<P>
 Unemployment in Orange County peaked at 7.9% in July, 1993, but has since 
edged downward. 
</P>
<P>
 Like California and the nation, Orange County has seen its job market boosted 
by continuing growth in the temporary help industry. In October, that accounted 
for a big part of the county's 2,100 new payroll jobs in the services sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Wilson, president of Thomas Temporaries, an Irvine-based firm with 19 
offices in Southern California, said many businesses in the region are still 
reluctant to hire regular employees permanently, so they call on firms like 
his. 
</P>
<P>
 "It follows the recovery of businesses," said Wilson, adding that demand for 
temporary help in clerical, technical and light industrial work are all up. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's economy saw healthy job gains in the amusement industry, 
health services and educational services. The county also added 400 retail and 
wholesale trade jobs last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction jobs in the county were down 100 in October from the previous 
month, to 45,600. But that was still up by 1,100 jobs from October, 1993, 
mostly in specialty trades such as plumbing and carpentry. 
</P>
<P>
 "The work has increased," said Ron Kennedy, executive secretary of the 
Building and Construction Trades Council of Los Angeles and Orange County. In 
Orange County, Kennedy said, union workers have been helped by such projects as 
the new parking lot and administration building at Disneyland. 
</P>
<P>
 The only sector that showed significant weakness last month was the finance 
and real estate industry, which lost 900 jobs, mainly because of lingering 
troubles in the banking community, where consolidation and closures are 
continuing. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, though, October's report provided some much-needed good news for 
Orange County, which recently has been jolted by announcements of layoffs at 
large corporations that include Hughes Aircraft in Fullerton and AST Research 
in Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no question that a recovery is proceeding," said Anil Puri, chairman 
of Cal State Fullerton's economics department. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's report showed that 1.28 million people in the county were working in 
October. That was up nearly 30,000 from September and an increase of 40,000 
since October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County outpaced other areas in the Southland as well as the state as a 
whole. "The bright light is Orange County," said Jack Kyser, economist for the 
Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County.

 California's jobless rate for October stood at 7.7%, down from 8.3% the 
previous month. Statewide, total employment is still off about 300,000 jobs 
from its peak in June, 1990. Nationally, unemployment dipped a tenth of a 
percentage point last month to 5.8%, the lowest rate in four years.

<P>
 Los Angeles County's jobless rate for October was 7.8%, down from 8.3% in 
September. The jobless rates for Riverside, San Bernardino and Ventura counties 
also dropped in October, reports released Monday show, but each of those areas 
lagged behind the state's performance. Jobless Rate Drops

WELCOME TO 1894 IN NEWBURY PARK; * THE STAGECOACH INN MUSEUM TAKES CHILDREN ON 
A HISTORICAL JOURNEY -- AND BACK A FULL CENTURY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 There is a term often used when describing movies and books that can be 
appropriately applied to the Stagecoach Inn Museum in Newbury Park -- 
suspension of disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be that the replica stagecoach has an axle that does not turn. After 
all, the closest it came to the true West was on a Hollywood set. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's true that when children crowd into a pioneer kitchen to bake 
biscuits, an electric toaster is hidden in the antique black iron stove. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the inn itself. The real one burned down in April, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 But every Wednesday, when wide-eyed children crowd into the historical museum, 
employees at the Stagecoach Inn will insist that the year is 1894, not 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle to maintain historical accuracy is the key to this learning 
museum's success, says Carol Anderson, the museum director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people, and especially children, to see exactly what this area was 
like when people used to come through here on the stagecoach," Anderson said. 
"It's the best way to learn about the past." 
</P>
<P>
 And museum officials have done their best to recreate the past. Downstream 
from the Stagecoach Inn, hidden from Ventu Park Road by a grove of sycamore 
trees, are a pioneer house, a Spanish soldier's adobe and a Chumash hut. 
</P>
<P>
 And just south of the inn is a three-quarter-sized replica of Timber School, 
once the area's only one-room schoolhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 Constructed by high school students over the past three years, Timber School 
was initially scheduled for completion last June, but the opening has been 
delayed until April because the students wanted the project to be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through construction, a 78-year-old former Timber School student 
noticed that plans for the wood-framed building omitted a second entrance which 
was used to split boys from girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted everything to be just as it was," Anderson said. "Otherwise, 
there was no point in building it." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the floor is completed and the antique schoolroom furniture is moved in, 
Anderson said, schoolchildren will be able to learn what it was like to sit in 
class a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, third-, fourth- and fifth-graders from across the Conejo Valley 
will continue a program established to recreate life from the days when the 
inn, called the Grand Union Hotel, was a stopover for stagecoaches traversing 
the hilly terrain between Los Angeles and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Children pound acorns and carry firewood as the Chumash, Spanish and pioneers 
did many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first we just gave them a lecture and a tour," said Miriam Sprankling, the 
museum's historian. "But we wanted the children to have a hands-on experience. 
Now after three hours they really feel like they were a part of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Area parents and museum enthusiasts said they have found the program 
invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's extremely important that children learn the history of how their 
community was formed," said Daryl Reynolds, president of the Conejo Valley 
Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our children are growing up in a very high-tech world," Reynolds said. "This 
gives them a chance to know how it was before there were computers and 
televisions and cars." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the museum, a tour geared for adults and children recreates the living 
quarters of the inn, and shows displays ranging from antique irons and vacuums 
to historical photographs of spots around the Conejo Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most people who live in this area don't know about this precious resource," 
Sprankling said. "It's a little jewel in our community." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The Stagecoach Inn Museum Complex is located at 51 S. Ventu Park Road in 
Newbury Park. It is open Wednesday through Sunday from 1 to 4 p.m. and offers 
docent-led tours. Admission is $2 for adults, $1 for seniors over 62 and 
children 5 to 12, and free for children under 5. For more information, call 
498-9441.

CANDIDATE FOR COUNCIL LOSES LEAD IN FINAL TALLY; FILLMORE: EVARISTO BARAJAS IS 
DEFEATED BY INCUMBENT DON GUNDERSON IN COUNT OF ABSENTEE VOTES. HE WOULD HAVE 
BEEN THE FIRST LATINO ELECTED IN 10 YEARS.

<P>
 Real estate agent Evaristo Barajas apparently has lost his bid to become the 
first Latino member of the Fillmore City Council in 10 years after failing to 
maintain his lead among absentee voters, county elections officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas, who has lived in the predominantly Latino city of 12,000 for more 
than three decades, lost his lead to incumbent Don Gunderson by 34 votes when 
the absentee ballots were counted. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a handful of provisional ballots -- those whose eligibility is under 
review -- still must be counted before the results are sent to individual 
cities next week, an election official said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials would not say Monday if there are enough provisional ballots out to 
affect the outcome. 
</P>
<P>
 After initial election returns were counted Nov. 8, Barajas was 18 votes ahead 
of Gunderson, a retired Navy captain who now works as an engineer and is 
serving his first term. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gunderson said Monday that he was not surprised by the turnaround, because 
he received so much positive feedback as he campaigned during the final days 
before the election. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had talked with an awful lot of people who had put in absentee ballots, and 
from walking out there and knocking on doors, a lot of people indicated they'd 
already voted and they'd already voted for me," Gunderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had my fingers crossed when they started counting the absentees," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas, who tallied 1,411 votes to Gunderson's 1,445, would have been the 
first Latino council member since longtime Councilman Ernest J. Morales chose 
not to seek reelection 10 years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Almost 60% of the city is of Hispanic origin, according to the 1990 U.S. 
Census. 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas could not be reached for comment Monday. But past and current members 
of the City Council and community leaders praised both candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "We knew it was going to be a close one," said Morales, who served 16 years on 
the council. "We really had high hopes about him possibly replacing one of the 
two incumbents." 
</P>
<P>
 Morales challenged Latinos in Fillmore to organize further to get a Latino 
elected to the council. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just looking at the numbers, I should think there should be at least one, 
even two," he said. "But I don't think it's going to happen until the Latino 
community really gets their act together and gets active." 
</P>
<P>
 Barajas "did extremely well for his first time out," said Hank Carrillo, 
executive director of the Fillmore Chamber of Commerce. "He did better than 
some people expected, but he didn't have the name recognition that Don did. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don's done a great job, and Evaristo would have too," Carrillo said. "We're 
lucky we had people of that caliber running. I hope he considers running 
again." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Linda Brewster, who easily won reelection with more than 1,900 votes, 
said she wishes there was room on the council for both Gunderson and Barajas. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was quite a thing for a challenger to unseat an incumbent because there 
was no controversial issue that was angering the community," Brewster said. 
"It's a loss for Fillmore not to have Evaristo, but that would mean that Don 
wouldn't have gotten in." 
</P>
<P>
 The mayor said she would invite Barajas to apply for positions on some city 
advisory committees. "There are a lot of ways for citizens to get involved in 
the community," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 City Clerk Noreen Withers said many members of the Latino community have not 
chosen to participate in local government. 
</P>
<P>
 "People wonder why in a town that has as many Hispanics as Fillmore there 
haven't been more Latino council members," Withers said. "But for them to be 
elected, they have to run. For some reason in recent years, there just haven't 
been the candidates." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The absentee count conducted since Nov. 8 by Ventura County election officials 
yielded one other change among local races: incumbent Trustee Robert Villa of 
the Santa Paula Union School District was beaten for the third seat by Terry 
Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson trailed Villa by 66 votes on Election Day but made up enough ballots 
from absentee votes to jump to third place by 34 votes.

JURY VIEWS GRIM PHOTOS OF SLAYING VICTIM'S BODY; COURT: DESPITE DEFENSE'S 
OBJECTIONS, JUDGE ALLOWS PICTURES OF KELLIE O'SULLIVAN IN DECOMPOSED STATE TO 
BE SHOWN AS DEPUTY CORONER TESTIFIES IN MARK SCOTT THORNTON'S MURDER TRIAL. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite earlier reservations against allowing jurors to see pictures of Kellie 
O'Sullivan's badly decomposed body, a judge allowed two gruesome autopsy 
photographs to be shown Monday at Mark Scott Thornton's murder trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath's decision came over vehement 
objections from attorneys for the 20-year-old defendant, who prosecutors say 
shot and killed the nurse Sept. 14, 1993, and stole her truck. 
</P>
<P>
 "The prejudicial aspect of this is enormous," Deputy Public Defender Howard J. 
Asher said of the photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 The pictures were taken shortly after O'Sullivan's body was found in the Santa 
Monica Mountains 12 days after her disappearance and shooting death. McGrath 
also allowed the jury to see four photos of the heavily soiled clothes the 
nurse was wearing when her body was found. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had asked the judge to allow the jury to see the photographs so 
they could better understand complex testimony from Dr. James Ribe, the Los 
Angeles County deputy coroner who conducted the autopsy in the case. Ribe was 
the only witness to take the stand Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Granted, they are not pleasant," Deputy Dist. Atty. Peter D. Kossoris said of 
the pictures. "But murder isn't pleasant." 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath agreed the photographs depicted a horrible sight. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've viewed the photographs," said the judge, who has presided over more than 
30 murder trials in his two decades on the bench, "and they are as unpleasant 
as any photographs I have had to look at." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, McGrath said the pictures would be beneficial for the jury. 
</P>
<P>
 Though jurors looked intently at the photos, their facial expressions betrayed 
no shock at what they were seeing. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath's decision came two months after he ordered prosecutors not to show 
two other gruesome pictures of the body from the crime scene. In that ruling, 
he gave permission for a third, less horrific photograph from the scene to be 
shown during the trial. He ordered prosecutors to touch up the picture. 
</P>
<P>
 Ribe's testimony began the fourth week of Thornton's murder trial. If 
convicted of first-degree murder under a special circumstance -- robbery or 
kidnaping -- the young defendant could be sentenced to death in the gas 
chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 Ribe told the jury that O'Sullivan was shot once in the chest and twice in the 
back and that her assailant appeared to have fired his gun from a downward 
angle. 
</P>
<P>
 That supported testimony from a ballistics expert, who told the jury last week 
that O'Sullivan appeared to have been kneeling when she was shot. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have theorized that the nurse did not expect to be shot, noting 
that she apparently was still carrying her purse and some personal papers when 
her life was taken. Had she expected to be shot, they have said, she would have 
tried to struggle with her attacker. 
</P>
<P>
 Under cross-examination, Asher asked Ribe if he were sure that the nurse was 
on the ground and shot by someone standing above her. He was not 100% sure, 
Ribe responded, but he maintained that his testimony was the most probable 
scenario. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, I wasn't there when she was shot," the forensic pathologist told 
Asher. "So I don't know for a fact what position she was in." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ribe also testified that there was no evidence to indicate that O'Sullivan 
struggled before the shooting. But her body was so badly decomposed, he said, 
that evidence that would have indicated a struggle -- such as bruises or other 
marks -- probably would not have been visible by the time the body was found. 
</P>
<P>
 The decomposition was so advanced, Ribe said, that he initially thought 
O'Sullivan had been shot all three times in the back. But on closer inspection, 
he was able to determine that one shot -- probably the first one -- struck the 
woman in the chest, Ribe said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said O'Sullivan probably lost consciousness within 30 seconds to a 
minute after being shot first in the chest. That bullet, he said, ripped 
through her aorta of the left lung, causing her to bleed profusely, he said.

FLEISS DEFENSE AIRS COMPLETE VERSION OF VICE STING VIDEO; COURTS: ATTORNEYS 
CONTEND THAT SOMETIMES COMICAL TAPE SHOWS POLICE ENTRAPPED THE ALLEGED 
HOLLYWOOD MADAM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The awkward -- and comical -- side of high-priced prostitution got a rare 
airing Monday, as Heidi Fleiss' lawyers launched their defense by showing the 
jury an unexpurgated videotape of the vice sting that led to the 28-year-old 
alleged madam's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 As the Los Feliz pediatrician's daughter sat impassively in a conservative 
tweed suit and black turtleneck, the 1 1/2-hour video spun out scene after 
scene of strained small talk, bad acting, self-conscious burlesque and fake, 
ad-libbed Japanese. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, a plump, middle-aged undercover detective, posing as a Tokyo 
businessman, confesses to admitted rookie prostitute Kim Burch that he wants 
"to do American thing, special thing." Puzzled, the dark-haired young woman 
erupts in giggles and asks: "You mean, like, stand on my head? Or what?" 
</P>
<P>
 Fleiss' lawyers, Anthony Brooklier and Donald Marks, deployed the video Monday 
in an effort to persuade the jury that Fleiss was entrapped by police. 
Periodically, they stopped the action to point out to jurors that talk of money 
and specific sex acts was initiated by undercover officers. 
</P>
<P>
 Although prosecutors showed snippets of the video to the jury earlier in 
Fleiss' week-old trial, the tape had been heavily excerpted and it was not 
until Monday that the full play-by-play of the sting became public. Fleiss has 
pleaded not guilty to charges of pandering and possession of cocaine for sale. 
</P>
<P>
 The tape, depicting visits by four confessed prostitutes last June to 
undercover detectives at the Beverly Hilton Hotel, was shot by a hidden camera 
in Suite 814. Prosecutors have alleged that Fleiss set up the assignations for 
Beverly Hills Police Detective Sammy Lee, who testified that he gained her 
confidence by posing as a Honolulu textile merchant looking for call girls to 
close a deal with some clients from Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Deputy Dist. Atty. Alan Carter rested the prosecution's case after 
eliciting testimony from two of the four women featured in the video. 
</P>
<P>
 One, ex-model Samantha Burdette, testified that Fleiss had dispatched her to 
Lee's hotel room on June 8, 1993, and again the following night, for a fee of 
$1,500 per date, which she was to split 60-40 with Fleiss. On the second night, 
she said, she brought with her two packets of cocaine. The other woman, Burch, 
told the jury that her assignation with the undercover officers marked her 
first act of prostitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither of the other two women involved -- Peggy Schinke and Brandi McClain -- 
has been called, although all four have been granted immunity. Sources have 
said that Schinke, a platinum blonde Canadian with a small child, has 
disappeared. McClain for several months has been Fleiss' on-and-off roommate 
and manager of her Pasadena lingerie boutique. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's video first shows Burdette visiting Lee on June 8, sipping a drink as 
the detective counts out "$1,500 in hard-earned money" and then asks, "What's 
it get?" 
</P>
<P>
 "It gets what you want," Burdette replies. Lee describes three sex acts and 
she consents to two. Then, as the thin, sweet-faced model strips to her red 
thong bikini underwear and arranges herself on the hotel bed, the smoke alarm 
goes off in the next room, where Lee's fellow officers are watching the scene 
via hidden camera. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone was smoking," Lee told the jury, as Superior Court Judge Judith L. 
Champagne laughed out loud. Prosecutor Carter, however, later disagreed, saying 
outside the courtroom that the alarm had been triggered by a cellular phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The scene was one of several unintentionally hilarious moments, as the young 
women struggled to appear worldly while the police tried to impersonate Tokyo 
executives without knowing a word of Japanese.

EX-FIRE CAPTAIN CHARGED IN 4 DEATHS IN 1984 STORE BLAZE; ARSON: ONCE ACCLAIMED 
INVESTIGATOR, NOW SERVING A 30-YEAR SENTENCE FOR SETTING SIX FIRES, COULD FACE 
DEATH PENALTY IF CONVICTED OF SOUTH PASADENA CRIME. 
</P>

<P>
 A former Glendale fire captain serving a 30-year prison term for setting six 
fires was charged Monday with murdering four people who perished in a 1984 
hardware store blaze he allegedly started in South Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 John Orr, who was once nationally acclaimed for his investigative work, was 
also charged with 22 additional counts of arson for allegedly setting fires in 
1990 and 1991, including one that destroyed 67 homes in the College Hills area 
of Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Because prosecutors attached a special circumstances provision to the murder 
charges, Orr could face the death penalty for the fire at the former Ole's Home 
Center on Fair Oaks Avenue, whose victims included a 2-year-old boy shopping 
with his grandmother. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Michael J. Cabral, who filed the new charges Monday in Los 
Angeles Municipal Court, said some investigators have suspected for years that 
it was Orr, now 45, who ignited the deadly blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire began in a section displaying foam rubber and moved through the vast 
hardware store so quickly it trapped employees Carolyn Kraus, 26, and Jimmy 
Cetina, 17, as well as patron Ada Deal, 50, and her grandson, Matthew Troidl. 
</P>
<P>
 But sheriff's detectives were unable to eliminate all possible accidental 
causes, and at the time Orr was a highly respected fire investigator who seemed 
immune from suspicion, Cabral said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until his arrest almost three years ago for setting several fires 
around Los Angeles and Fresno that local investigators took a fresh look at the 
Ole's blaze, Cabral said, particularly after the disclosure of an unpublished 
novel in which Orr chronicled the life of a firefighter who was really a 
firebug. 
</P>
<P>
 The bizarre manuscript, which federal prosecutors said provided them with a 
road map to his 1992 conviction, offers "a very detailed analysis" of a 
hardware store fire that bears striking similarities to the one at Ole's, 
Cabral said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It even went into very detailed information" about what people were thinking 
inside the store as the flames spread, the prosecutor added. 
</P>
<P>
 The new investigation also led back to an eyewitness -- a firefighter 
responding to the scene -- who saw Orr standing outside the store taking 
photos, Cabral said. Again, Cabral said, Orr's reputation as an aggressive 
investigator shielded him from questioning about what he was doing there. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Giannini of Century City, an attorney for Orr, said Monday he did not 
know of any new information stemming from the 1984 blaze other than the fact 
that Orr had been convicted of setting unrelated fires.  
</P>
<P>
 "I thought they had terminated this particular investigation," Giannini said, 
adding that he thought the cause had been deemed accidental. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cabral said that the fatal fire's origin had remained undetermined, and 
that it now appears to fit the same pattern as those for which Orr has been 
convicted. 
</P>
<P>
 All occurred in stores open for business that sold hardware or housewares, 
including highly flammable fabrics and foam, Cabral said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orr was convicted in U.S. District Court in Fresno of setting fire to the 
Family Bargain Center in Tulare and the CraftMart and Hancock Fabrics stores in 
Bakersfield on Jan. 16, 1987, while he attended an arson investigators 
conference in the area. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, he pleaded guilty to three additional counts of arson -- one for a 
1990 fire at a Builder's Emporium in North Hollywood and two more along Pacific 
Coast Highway in the Atascadero area. The latter he set while returning from a 
1989 conference of arson investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 The new arson charges stem from a June 27, 1990, fire in the College Hills 
area of Glendale that destroyed 67 homes; an Oct. 2, 1991, house fire on 
Kennington Drive in Glendale; a Nov. 22, 1991, fire at Warner Studios that 
engulfed the set for the "Waltons" television series; and three brush fires on 
Nov. 23, 1991, in Glendale and the La Canada Flintridge foothills. 
</P>
<P>
 No arraignment date has been set for Orr, who is in custody at Terminal Island 
Federal Prison and has to be transferred to Los Angeles County Jail. Because of 
the murder charges, he will be held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Orr had an uncanny knack for finding incendiary devices where his 
colleagues had failed, and after his arrest he became a suspect in dozens of 
Southern California fires -- some of which he investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 But it was his unpublished novel "Points of Origin" that provided the most 
sensational evidence against Orr, who had touted the work to agents and 
publishers as "fact-based." 
</P>
<P>
 "He felt fright but it excited him," Orr wrote of a fictional firefighter who 
attends an arson investigators conference in Fresno and sets fire to a fabric 
store there. 
</P>
<P>
 "His fires gave him the much-needed attention he craved," the fictional work 
continued, "providing him with feelings of importance and recognition."

MALIBU ARSON PROBE FIGURE IS IN JURY POOL; SIMPSON CASE: IN HIS QUESTIONNAIRE,

PROCESS IS STALLED BRIEFLY AS DEFENSE SEEKS TO QUESTION ITO'S WIFE.

 The wide net cast for jurors in the O.J. Simpson murder trial has gathered in 
people from all walks of life, but none with a more unusual claim to fame than 
a young man who was scheduled to appear Monday: Six months ago, he was one of 
two firefighters accused of setting last year's deadly Malibu blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of the court day Monday, jury selection was interrupted briefly by 
what had been billed as an opportunity for defense attorneys to question 
Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito's wife, Los Angeles Police Capt. Margaret 
York. After an hourlong, private session involving Superior Court Judge Curtis 
Rappe and the lawyers, however, Rappe announced that he was giving Simpson's 
attorneys time to prepare a motion and would take the matter up again Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 On the questionnaire completed by all jury prospects, the firefighter -- whose 
name has previously been published in connection with the fire inquiry but is 
being withheld now because of Superior Court Judge Lance A. Ito's request that 
prospective jurors in the Simpson case not be identified -- expressed anger 
about his ordeal and disdain for the authorities behind it. 
</P>
<P>
 After a lengthy investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, 
authorities decided not to charge that man and one other with setting the 
blaze, which killed three people and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in 
property damage. The two men filed a lawsuit against the county and Sheriff 
Sherman Block on Monday, alleging that Block defamed them by implicating them 
in the blaze during an interview with a television news program. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sheriff Sherman Block publicly accused my friend and me of starting the 
Malibu fire," the 29-year-old firefighter from Northridge said. "As a result, I 
was basically crucified by the media, and I have a very bad taste in my mouth 
with regards to the concept of due process." 
</P>
<P>
 In response to other questions, the firefighter said Block "is not my friend" 
and expressed low regard for the Los Angeles County district attorney's office, 
which is prosecuting Simpson for the June 12 murders of Nicole Brown Simpson 
and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. Simpson has pleaded not guilty, and his 
lawyers have repeatedly asserted that authorities have the wrong man. 
</P>
<P>
 "The D.A.'s office is not always concerned, or should I say, is very little 
concerned, with the truth," wrote the firefighter, who was suspended from 
active duty during the investigation but since has returned to his firefighting 
job. He did not show up for questioning Monday -- he was busy fighting an 
early-morning fire in Westlake -- but was asked to appear when another batch of 
prospective jurors is called in.  
</P>
<P>
 But the firefighter is not the only person on the jury panel with a noteworthy 
piece of personal history. Among the jury prospects interviewed Monday was a 
man who claimed credit for thwarting two assassination attempts on Ronald 
Reagan. 
</P>
<P>
 That man showed up as scheduled, fidgeting in the jury box as he waited his 
turn to be interviewed. But he was released without answering a single question 
after Judge Ito and the attorneys conferred privately. 
</P>
<P>
 Jury selection has dominated nearly two months of the Simpson trial, but 
York's testimony had been eagerly anticipated since last week, when defense 
attorneys announced that they wanted to question her about an internal Police 
Department investigation of Detective Mark Fuhrman. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuhrman testified during the preliminary hearing that he found a bloody glove 
outside Simpson's home hours after the murders. Since then, he has come under 
withering defense scrutiny. But the Simpson camp's latest attack involves York 
as well, as defense attorneys are seeking to determine whether she ever 
investigated the detective and thus whether she might be called as a witness 
during the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Although police sources say that she did not, it could create problems for Ito 
continuing to preside over the case if she did, since he could not oversee his 
own wife's testimony. Resolution of that question was delayed Monday when Judge 
Rappe said he wanted to question York privately before deciding whether 
Simpson's lawyers should be allowed to put her on the stand; he also asked 
defense attorneys to file a motion on the subject in writing and said he would 
take the matter up Dec. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys have prepared questions for Rappe to ask York. Lawyers for 
the city and county have filed objections to York being questioned about 
Fuhrman. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in the quest to find alternate jurors for the trial, one other 
woman was dismissed Monday after she seemed to have trouble grasping the notion 
that a criminal defendant has no obligation to prove his innocence. But 
attorneys cleared other panelists -- all of them with more mundane personal 
stories than the firefighter or the assassination-stopper -- for possible 
service. That brought the total pool of alternate-juror prospects to 33. 
</P>
<P>
 Prospective alternates who were retained on the panel Monday included a white 
agricultural inspector and a black hospital worker, both of whom have had some 
contact with people in law enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 The agricultural inspector, a 47-year-old Long Beach resident, said he 
volunteers as a Scoutmaster for a local Boy Scout troop; one of the other 
adults involved in the troop is a Los Angeles Police Department officer, the 
man said, adding that he does not know the officer well. 
</P>
<P>
 That prospective juror expressed reservations about serving on the Simpson 
panel, saying that he found a previous jury experience disagreeable and that 
the public interest in this trial worried him. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of nuts out there, and one way or another, they might go after 
a juror or a member of this court," he said. Nevertheless, he pledged to be 
fair to both sides. He was retained for possible service. 
</P>
<P>
 The hospital worker, who said she came into contact with police and paramedics 
regularly while working in an emergency room, said she too had served on a jury 
before. But she had a far different reaction to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I enjoyed jury duty," she said. "It was like a vacation away from work." 
</P>
<P>
 Although that woman wrote on her questionnaire that she thought it would be 
awful for anyone to be accused of such horrible crimes as Simpson had, she 
insisted that her answer was not meant to express sympathy for the football 
great. After she was questioned by both sides, she was retained for possible 
further service. 
</P>
<P>
 She and other prospective alternates are being asked to return in early 
December, when prosecutors and defense attorneys will begin exercising 
peremptory challenges. They are hoping to find 15 alternate jurors to 
supplement the eight men and four women already sworn in as the jury in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 With opening statements in the trial expected in January, both sides still are 
staking out legal positions and jockeying over the evidence that the jury will 
be allowed to hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, Simpson's lawyers filed a motion under seal seeking to suppress any 
evidence suggesting that Simpson struck his ex-wife. Among other things, that 
could include a 1989 incident in which Simpson pleaded no contest after he was 
charged with beating Nicole Simpson, and a 1993 emergency call in which she 
begged police to come to her assistance because a man she identified as her 
ex-husband was beating down the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Those incidents have made spousal battery a longstanding background issue in 
the murder case, and prospective jurors have been asked about their experiences 
with domestic abuse. Monday, one jury candidate said that he and his wife had a 
fight 19 years ago and that he pushed her to the ground after she spat in his 
face. 
</P>
<P>
 Under questioning by Deputy Dist. Atty. William Hodgman, the man said he had 
felt bad about the incident and cried over it afterward. He said it would not 
affect his ability to fairly judge the evidence in the Simpson case, and he was 
left on the panel. 
</P>
<P>
 Selection of alternate jurors for the Simpson case continues today before 
breaking until next week because of the Thanksgiving holiday.

THIRD FIRE IN 5 MONTHS HITS CLOSED HOTEL; SLUMS: THE BLAZE IS BELIEVED TO HAVE 
BEEN STARTED BY TRANSIENTS TRYING TO KEEP WARM. OFFICIALS SAY OWNERSHIP OF THE 
WESTLAKE STRUCTURE IS HAZY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A pre-dawn blaze near Downtown Los Angeles early Monday partially gutted a 
hotel that has a history of serious fire and health violations, sending 
transients living inside scrambling for safety through flames and thick, black 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire was the third in the past five months at the five-story Californian 
Hotel, which city officials say is a classic slum building where a changing 
cast of owners suck out profits, fail to make repairs and leave tenants in 
miserable conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze, which sent flames shooting into the darkened sky, was believed to 
have been started by squatters who lit small fires to stay warm, fire officials 
said. Four occupants were hurt in the blaze, including one person who injured 
his leg jumping from a window. The others suffered from smoke inhalation, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The blaze could have been disastrous had it started on the ground level and 
trapped occupants and firefighters on the upper floors, Los Angeles Fire Chief 
Donald O. Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a potential killer fire," Manning said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 200-room hotel had been cited for 30 building and safety violations by the 
Los Angeles Housing Slum Task Force, which targets owners of the city's most 
dilapidated apartment complexes. Since July, city officials have been in court 
on several occasions in a futile effort to sort out the tangled ownership of 
the building. A number of people who officials believe own the property deny 
responsibility for maintaining the run-down structure. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody is blaming everyone else for the conditions of the building, and 
everyone is denying they own it," said Deputy City Atty. Richard M. Bobb, who 
heads the multi-agency task force. "I have a very cynical belief that the 
Californian Hotel will be torn down at taxpayers' expense, that there will be 
several lawsuits to determine who owns the building and that somebody will put 
a strip mall on the site and make a profit on the backs of the tenants who had 
to live in substandard conditions." 
</P>
<P>
 Just two weeks ago, task force inspectors had reported to the city's Building 
and Safety Department that transients were living in the hotel, Bobb said, but 
apparently no action was taken to remove them. 
</P>
<P>
 Building and Safety officials were unavailable for comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Keeping track of squatters has become more difficult since the Northridge 
earthquake, which created more abandoned buildings than inspectors could 
monitor. The recent cold snap has worsened the problem, causing more people to 
flock to homeless shelters and abandoned buildings across the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's blaze was reported shortly after 5:15 a.m. and was extinguished about 
an hour later by 186 firefighters from 36 fire companies. By the time the first 
crews had arrived, flames were shooting about 30 feet above the roof, black 
smoke was pouring out the windows and trapped occupants were perched on window 
ledges, witnesses said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was cooking real good," said Firefighter Milton Urquilla, who was among 
the first to arrive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The smoke and flames were coming down the hallway toward me. I didn't think I 
was going to make it," said Travis Washington, 43, who was rescued by 
firefighters from the fourth floor, where the blaze is believed to have 
started. "Those firemen saved my ass, man." 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators had not determined the exact cause of the blaze, but the chief 
said it appeared to have been started by squatters who lighted fires to stay 
warm. Manning noted that transients trying to keep warm started a blaze about 
two weeks ago in the hotel, located in the densely populated Westlake district 
just west of Downtown. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials met Monday to discuss demolishing the building at taxpayers' 
expense. The old hotel, its once-elegant brick facade scuffed and faded, was 
shut down by city officials in July because of numerous health and safety 
violations ranging from missing fire extinguishers to rat and insect 
infestation. There also was significant structural damage caused by a suspected 
arson fire that swept through the building in late June. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials sealed the building's entryways with plywood and metal bars. 
Monday, firefighters were forced to use specialized cutting tools to enter and 
battle the blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 But those precautions did little to stop the squatters, who said they ripped 
open a door in an alley on the side of the building just days after it was 
closed in July. The occupants said the hotel recently had about 150 occupants 
because of the weather. 
</P>
<P>
 "On every floor, there's some type of little fire," said occupant Robert 
Garcia, 36. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles city attorney's office filed a 30-count misdemeanor complaint 
against the owners on July 14, two months after city building officials had 
identified the structure as a slum. 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was initially believed that the building could be repaired, by 
July conditions had deteriorated so that city officials' top concern was simply 
getting the tenants out of an uninhabitable building, Bobb said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office subsequently amended its original complaint to 
charge the owners -- in a 50-count addendum -- with failing to pay relocation 
assistance to the tenants who were forced to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 But on three separate occasions, lawyers for the defendants -- the suspected 
owners of the property -- have obtained postponements from as many judges, 
despite the objections of city prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a trial set for Jan. 31, 1995. It's very unusual that a case like 
this would take this long," Bobb said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office is seeking a party it can hold responsible for the 
costs of boarding up the building and monitoring it. But that has not been 
easy. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, 1993, the building was purchased by Dali Dale Inc., whose principal 
was Dale Lohrer, according to Bobb. Within six months, the building had been 
sold for $1 to Dora Ali, the wife of Sayed Ali, a Las Vegas resident.  
</P>
<P>
 On Jan. 10, Dali Dale Inc., now controlled by Dora Ali, filed for bankruptcy 
and shortly thereafter turned over control of the firm to William Gilstrap. "We 
don't think any money changed hands in this transaction," Bobb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ali's attorney, John Eardley, declined to comment Monday on the ownership 
issue. Attorneys for the others involved in the transactions were unavailable 
for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Bobb, Gilstrap was identified as a possible suspect in an arson 
fire at the Ferraro Hotel that burned down in 1988. That Westlake hotel was 
owned at the time by Sayed Ali. The hotel property was later redeveloped as a 
strip mall. 
</P>
<P>
 On April 14, Gilstrap transferred title of the Californian Hotel to Josefa 
Lerner and Gregorio Groisman. Groisman is believed to be living in Brazil now, 
Bobb said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city attorney's office has filed its complaint against Groisman, Gilstrap, 
Lerner, the Alis and Dali Dale Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Lerner has told the city attorney that she was unaware that the property was 
deeded over to her, and the Alis say that when the slum housing violations 
occurred in May the property was actually controlled by Highland Federal Bank.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Groisman and Gilstrap are named in arrest warrants for failing to appear 
at any of the court hearings, Bobb said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said part of the inspection problem could be solved with additional 
resources. "If we had enough inspectors," he said, "we could stop slums before 
they happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Because of attrition, hiring freezes and budget cuts, there has been a 70% 
decrease in the number of fire prevention inspections since 1978, a city audit 
found last year. The City Council has proposed a $3-million measure to add 54 
building and safety inspectors. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 70,000 to 100,000 homeless people in Los Angeles County. But 
there are only about 2,500 beds in private Skid Row shelters and 1,250 
contracted through the Los Angeles Services Authority, a newly formed 
city-county agency that provides shelter. LOS ANGELES

SKIMMING THE SURFACE; * THE POND RATS NAVIGATE THEIR MINIATURE POWER BOATS ON 
-- AND ABOVE -- THE WATER AT CAMARILLO REGIONAL PARK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By J.E. MITCHELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With a friend quickly closing on him, Jay Duhon of Camarillo squeezed the 
throttle of his sleek powerboat and surged ahead -- spewing out a tail of water 
and leaving his challenger in his wake. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Duhon clearly outpaced his friend on this practice run, neither he 
nor his opponent ever risked getting wet. Duhon, a 35-year-old Hughes Aircraft 
communications technician, was on the bank of a pond in Camarillo Regional Park 
along with the 40 other members of a group called the Camarillo Pond Rats. They 
were indulging in radio-controlled power boating -- a high-tech hobby that has 
become one of the great passions of their lives, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "You should see us during club races -- it gets really interesting then," said 
Duhon during a recent practice session. "We'll turn a corner and all you can 
see are rooster tails of water. You just have to pray your boat got around the 
buoy." 
</P>
<P>
 The Pond Rats, a chapter of the 1,500-member North American Model Boaters 
Assn., race miniature versions of high-speed offshore boats.  
</P>
<P>
 The nitro-methane gas-fueled models typically can achieve speeds of 35 to 50 
m.p.h., depending on their make, class and size of engine, said Kathy Scott, 
the group's secretary-treasurer and a race team member. Some highly modified 
boats have been clocked at speeds close to 100 m.p.h., she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group races on a nine-acre, 17-million-gallon pond owned by the Camrosa 
Water District, which leases the site to the club for $500 a year. While 
children are welcome to participate in rookie and kids classes, the cost of 
making and operating the radio-controlled boats can be prohibitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Don McEntyre, owner of Blue Max Hobbies in Oxnard, says enthusiasts pay about 
$500 for an entry-level boat, while customized, higher-powered versions can run 
as high as $3,000 each. The boats' racing fuel can cost $30 a gallon, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is definitely one of those parent-child kind of hobbies," said McEntyre, 
himself a member of the Pond Rats. "You don't see a lot of kids involved on 
their own because of the expense." 
</P>
<P>
 And like their ocean-going brethren, members race boats of different designs 
-- deep V-style, twin-hulled hydros and tunnel-hulls -- the latter designed to 
ride on a small cushion of air just above the water's surface. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The boats, which range between three and five feet in length, are powered by 
tiny single-piston engines that can turn the vessel's propellers tens of 
thousands of revolutions per minute. For safety's sake, the boats' propellers 
are shrouded in wood or metal containers after the engines are started until 
just before launch. 
</P>
<P>
 Once in the water, the boat is navigated from shore by hand-held radios that 
activate tiny on-board circuits that control the rudders and engine speed. 
Collisions are studiously avoided, but a small rowboat stands ready nearby to 
help the racers collect their expensive crafts if mishaps occur. 
</P>
<P>
 With monthly club and Southern California district races, members of the Pond 
Rats say they have a strong competitive edge and want to see each other do well 
for the honor of the 10-year-old organization, Scott said. She added that the 
club has been tapped to host the organization's national competition at the 
pond next July, where about 800 boats are expected to compete.  
</P>
<P>
 "There are few things this exciting," Scott said. "I've been competing for two 
years and I've had nothing but a great time." 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the club members own at least three boats and spend countless hours in 
their home workshops perfecting their crafts. Come race day, however, all the 
time spent is worth it, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's a real tension-releaser," said John Willemsen, 33, of Thousand 
Oaks. "Once you're out here, you can forget all your troubles for a while."

OUSTED OFFICER SUES SIMI VALLEY IN U.S. COURT; PERSONNEL: LT. ROBERT KLAMSER, 
40, CONTENDS HE WAS DENIED RIGHT TO A HEARING A YEAR AGO WHEN HE WAS ORDERED TO 
TAKE A MEDICAL RETIREMENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Forced into retirement a year ago, a Simi Valley police lieutenant sued city 
officials in federal court Monday, alleging that he was denied his right to a 
personnel hearing before he was ousted. 
</P>
<P>
 Lt. Robert Klamser, 40, has been on paid administrative leave since last 
November, when the city ordered the 19-year veteran to take a medical 
retirement for undisclosed reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Klamser had sued the Police Department in Ventura County Superior Court last 
December, contending that the city and his superiors conspired to oust him. 
That suit was dismissed last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 So Klamser filed suit Monday in U.S. District Court in Los Angeles, demanding 
that the city grant him a full evidentiary hearing where he can challenge the 
department's findings that he was mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 The federal suit contends that the city, City Manager M. Lin Koester and 
Police Chief Willard Schlieter have denied Klamser's constitutional right to 
due process. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, Klamser alleges that the city unlawfully took him off its 
payroll, and he demands more than $50,000 in damages.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He also accuses the city of unlawfully demanding that Klamser pay the cost of 
an administrative law judge to determine whether he is mentally disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Klamser went without pay for about six months after his forced Nov. 23 
retirement, but the city reinstated his salary June 28, said his attorney, 
William Rehwald of Woodland Hills. Klamser earns about $66,000 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have asked for a full evidentiary hearing, which the city is dragging 
their feet on," Rehwald said. "Now they're trying to remove him a second time. 
I don't think they're going to be able to do it without a full evidentiary 
hearing." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials have repeatedly declined to comment on Klamser's case, saying 
it is a confidential personnel matter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The city's position is that I don't have any comment," City Atty. John 
Torrance said Monday. "We don't litigate issues in the press." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Klamser is under "house arrest" while waiting for the case to be 
resolved, Rehwald said. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that the veteran lieutenant, who has served as an international 
consultant on hostage negotiations, is receiving full pay but must stay at home 
during the hours he ordinarily would work, Rehwald said. 
</P>
<P>
 Klamser could not be reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Late last week, Klamser also filed a legal claim demanding that the city 
reimburse him for $25,000 he says he spent defending himself in a lawsuit that 
another officer filed against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Officer Paul Nolan sued Klamser, alleging that the lieutenant mishandled the 
department's inquiry into a citizen's 1989 allegation that Nolan had raped her. 
A Municipal Court judge dismissed the case after it was revealed that the woman 
had had a sexual relationship with the officer, and that they had exchanged 
gifts and Christmas cards after the alleged rape. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Torrance said that he is weighing the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked him to send us a specific breakdown," Torrance said. "Typically, when 
you're looking at legal fees you get an itemization of how much time is used 
doing this and that -- telephone bills, Xeroxing, filing fees. . . . We're 
looking into it."

COUNTY'S JOBLESS RATE FOR OCTOBER DECLINES TO 7.6%; EMPLOYMENT: SOME ECONOMISTS 
ARE OPTIMISTIC, BUT OTHERS SAY THE FIGURES ARE SKEWED BY SEASONAL FACTORS, 
ESPECIALLY IN THE EDUCATIONAL SECTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The county's unemployment rate dropped sharply in October, down from 8.9% in 
September to 7.6%, according to a report released Monday by the state 
employment department. 
</P>
<P>
 A year ago at this time, Ventura's unemployment rate had soared to 9.4%. 
During October, 1993, 35,800 county residents were out of work, compared to 
28,600 this October. 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest gain this year from September to October was in the educational 
sector, where 2,300 new jobs were added. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as several economists said they were cautiously optimistic about the 
local economy based on Monday's report, they hastened to point out that the 
unemployment rate has been somewhat skewed by seasonal factors. 
</P>
<P>
 Many school employees are statistically considered unemployed during the 
summer recess, causing a rise in unemployment figures each spring and a drop 
each fall. Because September statistics are gathered fairly early in the month 
-- just as many schools are returning to session -- some people who are about 
to return to work are not included in that month's survey. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, there was the same seasonal pattern," said Cal Lutheran economics 
professor Dr. Ali Akbari, who runs the university's center for economic 
research. "These are month to month changes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are absolutely no surprises," he added. "It's a continuation of the 
same pattern that has developed here in the early 1990s." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 As part of that pattern, Akbari and other economists say areas such as Ventura 
County will continue to see an increase in lower-paying service industry jobs 
while better-paying jobs in fields such as high technology and manufacturing 
dwindle. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 224,600 jobs now held within the county, 76% are in service areas. 
Since October, 1993, 500 high-technology manufacturing jobs have been lost in 
the county. Overall, manufacturing has lost 1,200 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 "The gains are in the service sector and the high paying jobs like high-tech 
manufacturing are recording losses," Akbari said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The job machine is doing its job. It is creating jobs, but the types of jobs 
are kind of different. These are hamburger flippers and parking lot attendants. 
Most service industry jobs are not high paying," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bruce DeVine, chief economist with the Southern California Assn. of 
Governments, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not all the manufacturing jobs that are lost or leaving the area are the high 
end of the scale," DeVine said. "You might have lost 30 jobs in a sardine 
canning factory and gained 40 jobs in computer business services. 
</P>
<P>
 "In business services, educational services, health services, the wages 
actually average fairly high," he said. "Certainly, there are occupations that 
earn more. It's kind of hard to beat those aerospace wages." 
</P>
<P>
 Larry Kennedy, manager of the state unemployment office in Simi Valley, said 
he has seen an improvement in the quality of job orders employers are filing 
with his office. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of very large private for-profit companies have placed orders in the 
$18- to $15-an-hour range," Kennedy said. "The supply of unemployed people is 
dwindling, so employers have to boost the wages a little. We've got a lot of 
orders in the $9 to $7 range and hardly anything in the $4 to $6 range." 
</P>
<P>
 But in a reflection of the larger trend away from higher paying jobs, Kennedy 
said October was a bleak month for unemployed middle managers and technicians 
enrolled in the office's job club. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out of 153 people in our job club, only six went back to work last month," he 
said, adding that in a good month, 15 members of the job club return to work. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Farm employment increased by 1,700 jobs from September to October. Farm Bureau 
head Rex Laird said farmers were probably planting their last crops of the 
season during the month, accounting for the increase. 
</P>
<P>
 "September and October is the time of year when a lot of stuff goes back into 
production," Laird said. "Especially row crops and vegetables. It takes 90 to 
110 days for celery and other vegetables, so that means most of that stuff will 
come out in December." 
</P>
<P>
 But as that harvest comes in during December, Laird said to look for a drop 
once again in farm employment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, there will be an increase in unemployment during November and 
certainly during December and January," he said. Ventura County Jobless Rate

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COVINA RESIDENTS 
PROTEST PLAN TO PAROLE RAPIST TO THEIR COMMUNITY 
</P>

<P>
 Carrying picket signs and lighting their way with candles, more than 3,000 
Covina residents rallied Monday to protest the scheduled parole of a convicted 
rapist into their community Dec. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Covina Police Chief John Lentz said state officials told him last week that 
Reginald Donald Muldrew, 46, suspected of more than 200 sexual attacks in Los 
Angeles during the 1970s, would be paroled into the San Gabriel Valley suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew -- dubbed the Pillowcase Rapist because he covered his victims' faces 
with pillowcases, blouses or scarves -- is scheduled to be released from 
Pelican Bay State Prison in Crescent City in December, said California 
Department of Corrections spokeswoman Christine May. 
</P>
<P>
 Muldrew was convicted in 1978 of four counts of rape with force, two counts of 
oral copulation with a child, one count of assault and several counts of 
burglary and robbery, May said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Muldrew also was a suspect in more than 200 sexual assaults in which 
the victims had pillowcases placed over their heads, as well as 150 burglaries 
from 1975 until his arrest in 1978. He has served time in several state 
prisons, including San Quentin, where he was a suspect in the 1971 murder of a 
prison guard but was not prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 Covina City Councilman Tom Falls said Muldrew committed 18 rapes in the four 
months before his arrest, and his victims ranged in age from 12 to 69. 
</P>
<P>
 May would not confirm that Muldrew would be paroled in Covina but said he 
probably will be paroled in Southern California if he passes a psychiatric 
exam.  
</P>
<P>
 In a speech at Monday's rally, Chief Lentz told the crowd that the city is 
checking to see whether any of Muldrew's victims now live near the community. 
Authorities have said that Muldrew's victims lived Compton, Southwest Los 
Angeles, the South Bay and the Wilshire district. 
</P>
<P>
 By state law, a rapist cannot be paroled within 35 miles of any of his 
victims, Lentz said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to fight to keep him out of our town," Lentz said. "Personally I 
don't want him released at all." LISA O'NEILL

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GROCERS TO 
PAY $38,000 OVER ILLEGAL CAMPAIGN GIFTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing a series of Southern California investigations of campaign 
financing, a state watchdog agency on Monday announced that a Los Angeles 
grocers group has agreed to pay a $38,000 penalty for illegally laundering 
political donations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican American Grocers' Assn., an organization of independent market 
owners, acknowledged making $14,300 in improper campaign contributions to six 
state and local candidates from 1990 through 1992, according to the settlement 
made public Monday.The group's president, Steven A. Soto, who signed the 
agreement, and an attorney representing the association could not be reached 
for comment late Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The violations involved association employees, who made contributions ranging 
from $500 to $5,000 to candidates and were reimbursed by the organization -- a 
practice banned by campaign finance laws intended to ensure a true picture of a 
candidate's financial backers. 
</P>
<P>
 Candidates receiving the funds were: state Assembly candidates Xavier Becerra, 
Kathleen Torres and Martha Escutia; county supervisor candidates Art Torres and 
Sarah Flores and San Fernando City Council candidate Rosa Chacon. Fair 
Political Practices Commission chief of enforcement Darryl East said there is 
no evidence that the candidates knew the donations were improper. The FPPC is 
expected to approve the settlement Dec. 1.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: GLENDORA; ARMORED CAR 
GUARD KILLED DURING HOLDUP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 28-year-old armored car guard was shot and killed Monday morning during a 
holdup at a Bank of America in Glendora. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Cardenas, who had worked for Armored Transport of California for six 
years, became at least the third armored car guard to be killed in Los Angeles 
County in the past four months. In July, a guard was killed in San Pedro, and 
in September another guard was killed in Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas was dead on arrival at San Dimas Community Hospital after being shot 
in the head and shoulders, said Glendora Police spokesman Jamie Caldwell.  
</P>
<P>
 Law enforcement authorities declined to say how much was taken, but one Bank 
of America source who asked not to be identified said the total was more than 
$400,000.  
</P>
<P>
 Two men posing as customers entered the bank in the 800 block of East Arrow 
Highway through the back door just as Cardenas was bringing money through the 
front door shortly before 10 a.m., Caldwell said. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the men fired several shots at close range at Cardenas, who fell 
through the front glass doors. The robbers escaped with the money in a gray, 
1987 Chevrolet pickup. The truck, which police said had been stolen in Arcadia 
in October, was found abandoned a few miles away in front of a store in the San 
Dimas Plaza. Police believe the suspects fled in another vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 Caldwell said both robbers are in their 20s, are about 5 feet 6 inches tall 
and weigh between 160 and 170 pounds. One was wearing a white T-shirt with a 
logo or emblem on it and a black baseball cap; the other was wearing a black or 
dark blue Members Only-type jacket and a black baseball cap.  
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who may have seen the men is asked to call Glendora police at (818) 
914-8250. LISA O'NEILL

 A Lawndale man whose 2-year-old niece was struck and killed by his car after 
he left the vehicle idling in his driveway will not be charged, officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Figueroa, 24, was arrested on suspicion of vehicular manslaughter on 
Saturday, the day after his 2-year-old stepson climbed into his idling 
Cadillac, shifted the transmission into gear and sent the car rolling over 
Esmeralda Figueroa, who died the next day.Her 4-year-old sister, Dora, was 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors called the the incident "an unfortunate accident." Esmeralda's 
father, who is Carlos Figueroa's brother, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't blame my brother," Filemon Figueroa, 30, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Carlos Figueroa was about to drive from his home on Prairie Avenue to pick up 
his paycheck at a local bakery when he paused to grab a shirt from the garage, 
Filemon Figueroa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Filemon Figueroa said he was was in the garage with his wife, Yolanda, and his 
brother when the car crashed through the door. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard a scream from outside," he said. "I trembled and shook, and I had no 
idea my girls were in the way." 
</P>
<P>
 The car pinned Yolanda Figueroa against the back of the garage but she was not 
injured, Filemon Figueroa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several families live in the small stucco home and its garage but Carlos 
Figueroa is the only resident with a job, family members say. At the time of 
the accident, Carlos Figueroa had an outstanding arrest warrant for driving 
without a license, and he will face charges in connection with that incident, 
officials said. JAMES BENNING

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; HIGH SCHOOL WHIZ KIDS STILL IN THE 
SPOTLIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAN STEVENS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Still jubilant after Saturday's victory in the county's academic decathlon, 
Moorpark High School's whiz kids are slated for even more honors. 
</P>
<P>
 The school's team defeated 13 others last weekend to win the right to 
represent Ventura County in statewide competition in March for the second 
consecutive year. 
</P>
<P>
 Team coach Larry Jones said the Moorpark City Council will pay tributeto the 
students Dec. 7, and the school board will honor them Dec. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the nice things about Moorpark is that because it's a small town 
there's lots of community support, and it becomes a community event," Jones 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students attributed their Saturday's victory to hard work, dedication and a 
family feeling among team members. Inspired by their studies for the fine arts 
portion of the decathlon, team members are planning to take waltzing lessons. 
And they celebrated Saturday's feat with a slumber party at a team member's 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was sadness before the gladness. In many ways, the decathlon win was 
a memorial to former team member Shane Umberger, who died in an automobile 
accident in June, one month after the decathlon team was selected. 
</P>
<P>
 Team member Kevin McQuilkin, 17, gave his overall competition medal to 
Umberger's mother, Carol Kelley, after the competition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like he was still one of the team," said Andrew Philip, who won first 
place in the overall competition, as well as six individual categories. 
Collectively, the team finished first in nine of 10 categories and defeated the 
closest competitor, Ventura's Buena High School, by 4,200 points. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the students worked hard for their victory, sacrificing free time 
on holidays and weekends in addition to taking a decathlon training class as an 
elective at school. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you don't have a class, it's hard to be competitive," the coach said. 
"It's like having a football team that's not allowed to practice. You're not 
going to win anything. People don't begrudge the athletes a class to lift 
weights." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones said the decathlon's rewards go beyond medals and plaques for team 
members and prestige for the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doing this kind of work gets these kids on the dean's list at Harvard, 
Stanford and Caltech," Jones said. "They know what hard work is, and they know 
what the payoff is." 
</P>
<P>
 This year's honors team -- students with GPAs above 3.75 -- included Philip, 
Karissa Lee and Bea Tantayanubutr. The scholastic group -- with GPAs from 3.0 
to 3.75 -- included Richard Fields, Chori Folkman and Dani Rabwin. Juan 
Gonzalez, McQuilkin and Erik Spiller made up the varsity team. 
</P>
<P>
 Alternates, who did not compete Saturday, were Richard Gallardo, Michelle 
Merriweather, Josh Runnion and Kendell Swenson. JAN STEVENS

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; EMPLOYER 
GUILTY UNDER IMMIGRANT DOCUMENT LAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The former manager of a Los Angeles medical clinic became the first employer 
in Southern California convicted of knowingly accepting counterfeit documents 
in the hiring of illegal immigrants, the U.S. attorney's office announced 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A federal court jury convicted Maria Leticia Ruiz de Cruz of Ontario of two 
counts of knowingly accepting counterfeit immigration documents, according to 
Assistant U.S. Atty.Brent A. Whittlesey, who prosecuted the case. Whittlesey 
said that de Cruz, 41, faces a maximum prison term of five years and a $250,000 
fine when she is sentenced Jan. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, Whittlesey said, an immigrant told de Cruz that an Alien 
Registration Receipt and a Social Security card were false. The prosecutor said 
that in the other instance, de Cruz knew the immigrant was not authorized to 
work in the United States and knew that the Social Security card that the 
immigrant presented belonged to another person. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither de Cruz nor her attorney could be reached for comment Monday.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: NORTHRIDGE; 17 ARRESTED 
FOR UNLICENSED CONTRACTING AT QUAKE SITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A weekend inspection of 76 work sites in earthquake-ravaged Northridge 
resulted in 17 arrests for contracting without a license, state officials said 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Another 14 people were cited for violations of workers' compensation and other 
statutes during the unusual weekend enforcement sweep led by investigators from 
the Contractors State License Board. 
</P>
<P>
 The sweep was aimed at preventing unlicensed contractors from victimizing 
homeowners affected by the Jan. 17 tremor, said board spokesman Sam Haynes.  
</P>
<P>
 Insurance companies and the Federal Emergency Management Agency are providing 
more than $3 billion to property owners in the quake zone to repair damage to 
homes and other property.  
</P>
<P>
 Since the quake, board investigators have used stings, sweeps and other 
enforcement actions to arrest more than 800 unlicensed contractors operating 
illegally in the hardest-hit areas.  
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds, if not thousands, of unlicensed contractors have flocked to the 
earthquake area for the specific purpose of swindling people eager to repair 
their homes as quickly as possible," said license board chief Gail Jesswein.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA FE SPRINGS; PLAN 
TO CLEAN UP CHEMICAL COMPANY SITE UNVEILED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 State and federal environmental officials have unveiled a plan for cleaning up 
contaminated soil and ground water at a Santa Fe Springs chemical company. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency are proposing that Phibro-Tech Inc. pump and treat ground 
water to remove contaminants, including cadmium, chromium and trichloroethane. 
</P>
<P>
 The agencies propose that Phibro-Tech investigate and, if necessary, clean up 
volatile contaminants in the soil. The plan also calls for monitoring soil and 
ground water, covering any unpaved portions of the site to prevent contact with 
contaminated soil, repairing the site cover, constructing a berm around the 
perimeter of the facility and restricting property use to prevent any school or 
residential developments. 
</P>
<P>
 The public may comment on the proposed cleanup plan by submitting written 
comments by Dec. 30 to Cal-EPA, or by attending a Dec. 13 community meeting. 
The meeting will begin at 7 p.m. at the Los Nietos Community and Senior 
Citizens Services in Whittier. 
</P>
<P>
 Phibro-Tech, a division of CP Chemicals Inc. of New Jersey, is in an 
industrial area at 8851 Dice Road in Santa Fe Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 The company produces a variety of inorganic chemicals used in the aerospace 
and electronics industries and also stores and treats off-site generated 
hazardous waste from those facilities.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
COMMITTEE OKS CRACKDOWN ON GUN DEALERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A proposal to tighten restrictions on firearms dealers -- keeping them out of 
residential areas and forcing them to operate from fixed addresses -- was 
approved Monday by a Los Angeles City Council committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The ordinance would attempt to crack down on dealers who are licensed by the 
federal government but who often sell guns out of car trunks and other 
makeshift locations without control by local authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's Public Safety Committee gave preliminary approval to an 
ordinance that would force the dealers to do business at fixed locations 
outside residential zones and to obtain insurance and city and state business 
tax permits. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 1,000 federal firearms licensees are registered in the city of Los 
Angeles, but only a small fraction operate at standard storefront locations. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee also asked the city staff to report back within three months on 
several other gun control proposals, including plans for restricting sales of 
ammunition.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CAR 
BROKERS SETTLE SUIT OVER DMV FEES FOR $1.25 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state's largest chain of automobile brokers agreed Monday to pay $1.25 
million to settle a lawsuit that charged the firm with failing to turn over 
more than $800,000 in auto registration fees to the Department of Motor 
Vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stipulated final judgment signed Monday by Los Angeles Superior Court 
Commissioner Murray Gross, the chain also agreed to a preliminary injunction 
banning the practice, which was said to involve the failure to remit fees paid 
by dealers who were buying or selling cars through the brokers. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles County's chief deputy district attorney, Thomas A. Papageorge, 
said the civil judgment was the largest in the 23-year history of his office's 
Consumer Protection Division. 
</P>
<P>
 Papageorge said the California Auto Dealers Exchange and its affiliate, the 
Fresno Auto Dealers Auction of Fresno, agreed to the settlement without any 
admission of wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the agreement, the brokers will pay the DMV $802,669 in unpaid 
registration fees. Civil penalties, which will go to the county, total 
$400,000. Investigative costs, to be divided by the district attorney's office, 
the DMV and the state attorney general's office, total $45,196.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BOTTLENECK REPORTED ON STUDENT GRANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF McDONALD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Officials at the Ventura County Community College District should hire more 
workers to process financial aid applications, making it easier for students to 
apply for grants, a task force has recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of the college district concludes in a report that drastic steps 
should be taken to overhaul the financial aid programs at Oxnard, Moorpark and 
Ventura colleges. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the three campuses has reported serious backlogs in processing 
thousands of applications for federal grants this semester.  
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard College has more than 1,000 incomplete applications, officials there 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 College district trustees will be asked next month to approve a plan to remedy 
the bottleneck. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm willing to put some money into financial aid," said John Tallman, who 
defeated Trustee Karen M. Boone in the Nov. 8 election and will take a seat on 
the governing board next month. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been underspending and it's killing us," Tallman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're heading toward driving the poor kids out of school. We have to protect 
that access (to financial aid), and it's also good business." 
</P>
<P>
 The committee recommended that computer terminals be placed at locations 
throughout the district so students could check their applications without 
disturbing staff. It also recommends that seasonal help be brought in to speed 
up processing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't disagree with any of those recommendations," Trustee Timothy D. 
Hirschberg said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly there's a cost factor, but we can work around those with existing 
staff and existing resources." JEFF McDONALD

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: BOARD MAY LIFT CAP ON APPEALS COSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARLOS V. LOZANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The cost of appealing a decision by either the Ventura County Planning 
Commission or its director would no longer be limited to $1,200 under a plan to 
be considered today by the Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 The county currently requires an $800 deposit -- with a maximum $1,200 -- to 
file an appeal, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's cost for writing staff reports and analyses associated with 
appeals, however, occasionally exceeds the $1,200 cap, said Todd Collart of the 
county's Resource Management Agency.  
</P>
<P>
 When this happens, the county must dip into its general fund to pick up the 
remaining costs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 To reduce expenses, the Resource Management Agency has recommended that 
applicants be responsible for the entire cost of processing the appeal, Collart 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meiners Oaks resident Pat Baggerly has complained in a letter to the board 
that if the fee cap is lifted, only wealthy individuals or large corporations 
would be able to afford appeals. Moreover, she said, there would be no 
motivation for the county's planning staff to keep a lid on costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Baggerly, a board member of the Ventura County Environmental Coalition, which 
has participated in appeals in the past, recommends that the county either 
maintain its current fee cap or reduce it. 
</P>
<P>
 "My hope is that the board will keep a lid on fees so that people can afford 
to participate in the democratic process here in Ventura County," Baggerly 
said. CARLOS V. LOZANO

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; MAN ADMITS THEFT AFTER ROBBERY CLAIM 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Moorpark electronics store clerk who claimed he was robbed outside a 
Thousand Oaks bank has confessed that he and an accomplice actually stole his 
store's receipts, police said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Antonette, 20, initially told Ventura County sheriff's detectives that 
he was held up at gunpoint at 7:45 p.m. Saturday while making a night deposit, 
said Lt. William Montijo. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonette told officers that a black man robbed him at the night-deposit slot 
of the Bank of America branch at 1440 N. Moorpark Road, but detectives found no 
suspect, Montijo said. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in a follow-up interview Sunday at the sheriff's East Valley Station, 
Antonette admitted that he and an individual he refused to name actually took 
the money. Antonette told detectives "he needed the money for debts," Montijo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonette let detectives into his home to retrieve half the $1,380 that was 
stolen, which they found in a jar in his bedroom, he said. The rest has not 
been recovered and detectives are seeking the unidentified accomplice, Montijo 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Antonette was arrested on suspicion of grand theft and filing a false police 
report. He was being held at the Ventura County Jail in Ventura in lieu of 
$5,000 bail. MACK REED

<P>
 They can't require it and they can't enforce it, but Thousand Oaks council 
members would like to encourage residents to shop in local stores. 
</P>
<P>
 So tonight, just in time for the Christmas rush, they will consider a "Buy 
Local" resolution.The formal policy statement officially urges residents -- and 
anyone else passing through town -- to keep sales tax dollars in Thousand Oaks 
by patronizing local stores. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel guilty when I don't buy local," Councilwoman Judy Lazar said, voicing 
support for the resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 While Conejo Valley Chamber of Commerce President Steve Rubenstein also backs 
the measure, he warned council members that simply raising a "Buy Local" cheer 
will not suffice. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's important is for our city fathers to see the big picture, to know that 
we have to have the right businesses here or else people will still drive away 
to get what they need," Rubenstein said. 
</P>
<P>
 Discount stores such as Target, Mervyn's and the Price/Costco have attracted 
more and more shoppers, he noted, and Thousand Oaks officials "can't be elitist 
and believe we can get by without them." STEPHANIE SIMON

JUDGE SCOLDED FOR JAILING MAN OVER LICENSING; COURTS: ALHAMBRA JURIST IS 
REPRIMANDED BY THE STATE COMMISSION ON JUDICIAL PERFORMANCE. HIS NO-BAIL BENCH 
WARRANT POLICY ON MISDEMEANORS IS FOUND UNCONSTITUTIONAL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Alhambra Municipal Court judge who jailed a Temple City man for four days 
for forgetting to license and vaccinate his dog was publicly reprimanded Monday 
by the state Commission on Judicial Performance. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission found that Judge Michael A. Kanner's blanket policy of issuing 
no-bail bench warrants for defendants who failed to appear in court on 
misdemeanor charges violated state Constitution and Penal Code provisions 
guaranteeing that "individuals have a right to bail before conviction, with 
limited exceptions." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the judge had issued no-bail warrants for as many as 200 people, 
the commission said his actions "resulted in the denial of a fundamental right 
to a considerable number of individuals." 
</P>
<P>
 The judge has acknowledged that his no-bail policy "was wrong," the commission 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kanner declined comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fourteen months ago, Robert C. Lewis, a 52-year-old Temple City equipment 
courier, was cited for failure to license and vaccinate a dog after his pet, 
Samantha, chased a cat into the street and was nabbed by a dogcatcher. 
</P>
<P>
 The next day, Lewis had the Labrador-German shepherd mix licensed and 
inoculated for rabies. Thinking that the matter had been resolved, the family 
promptly forgot about the whole thing, said Lewis' daughter, Jackie Lewis, 24, 
of San Dimas. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days later, unknown to the Lewises, Kanner issued a no-bail warrant for 
Lewis' arrest when he failed to appear in court to answer the misdemeanor 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 On March 3, Glendora police spotted Lewis' truck in a park-and-ride lot and 
ran a routine check on the license plate. When the warrant popped up, Lewis was 
arrested. After a night in the Glendora jail, he appeared in Citrus Municipal 
Court, but the case was transferred to a court in Alhambra, his daughter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had no idea what he was being held for," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said court officials offered to release her father if he signed an 
agreement promising to appear in court at a future date, but by that time he 
was so furious that he refused to sign anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "The next thing he knew, they were taking him to the L.A. County Jail," Jackie 
Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Presented with evidence that the dog had been licensed and vaccinated, Kanner 
subsequently dismissed the charges. But at the time, the judge defended his 
blanket no-bail policy, saying he had been forced to adopt it to close 
loopholes in a system that allows more serious misdemeanor offenders to ditch 
court.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; CONSULATE GIVES SCHOOLS BOOKS IN SPANISH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pulling one volume after another out of the small cardboard boxes, Barbara 
Simmons smiled as she ran her hand across the books' bright and shiny covers. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the books Simmons unpacked are in Spanish, a language she doesn't 
understand. But that did not dim the Channel Islands High School librarian's 
excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a program sponsored by the Mexican government, the Mexican consulate in 
Oxnard has donated three, 170-volume sets of Spanish-language books to 
libraries at Channel Islands, Oxnard and Santa Paula high schools. 
</P>
<P>
 Harrison and the librarians from the other two high schools each picked up 
their sets at the Oxnard Union High School District office Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Novels, short story collections, cookbooks and dictionaries -- each set of 
books covers a wide array of topics. Selected by Mexican educators, the books 
are designed to appeal both to native Spanish speakers and to English-speaking 
students trying to master a second language. 
</P>
<P>
 The selection includes many books that cash-conscious librarians would never 
think to buy, but which certainly appeal to youth, Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would never have bought this," she said, holding up a paperback called "The 
Young John Lennon" by a Latin American author. "But they'll love it." 
</P>
<P>
 About 60% of the 2,600 students at Channel Islands High School are Latino. And 
roughly two-thirds of these students have only limited English skills. 
</P>
<P>
 But of the 21,000 books in the school library, fewer than 500 are in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most Spanish-language books are published in foreign countries, U.S. 
libraries must buy expensive imports. While hardcover books in English run 
about $17 to $19, the same volumes in Spanish typically cost twice as much, 
Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 On top of the high cost of Spanish books, many California school libraries 
have suffered drastic budget cuts in recent years because of the state fiscal 
crisis. The result is that schools have been unable to buy the books needed to 
serve the growing number of students who know little English. 
</P>
<P>
 The donated books will also help English-speaking students who are taking 
advanced placement courses in the language for college credit, Harrison said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Mexican government is donating identical sets of the books to more than 
200 high schools in California and to other schools across the country, said 
Luis Ramirez, the Mexican consul in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez said he hopes the books will encourage Spanish-speaking students to 
read more and learn about their native culture. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very important for students to know their roots," Ramirez said. MAIA

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; DNA MATCH FOUND WITH RAPE SUSPECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 DNA testing shows that saliva found on a teen-age girl after she was raped 
during the holdup of a Camarillo yogurt shop matches the man charged with the 
assault and robbery, a prosecutor said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Also on Monday, defendant Christopher Bass of Goleta pleaded not guilty to a 
20-count indictment that charges him in a string of robberies last summer, 
including the one at the yogurt shop in which two teen-age girls were sexually 
assaulted. 
</P>
<P>
 Bass is charged with armed robbery at four pizza shops in Thousand Oaks before 
the Camarillo yogurt store holdup. Keith Groom, 21, of Simi Valley is charged 
with participating in two of those robberies, as well as a separate pizza shop 
holdup in Thousand Oaks in June.

SUPPORTING THE BASES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Let me see if I got this right. Ventura County is spending 300,000 of its 
taxpayers' hard-earned dollars to send some lobbyists to Washington, D.C. Their 
mission is to lobby the commission charged with the closure of military bases 
to leave Point Mugu and Port Hueneme off the list.  
</P>
<P>
 Excuse me, but isn't that the reason we have elected representatives? I mean, 
Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley) surely must be aware that these military bases 
are on the list. And one would assume that the reason he was elected in the 
first place is to act as ombudsman for Ventura County and to represent Ventura 
County's best interests. Why do we need lobbyists if we have Elton? Or why do 
we need Elton if we have lobbyists? 
</P>
<P>
 Surely Elton Gallegly and his staff are not so overburdened with legislative 
activities that they are unable to represent the best interests of the 
constituency. I seem to remember when Bob Lagomarsino represented this district 
prior to the gerrymander, that he argued successfully against the base 
closures. 
</P>
<P>
 My message to the county supervisors is this: Quit (wasting) the taxpayers' 
money on items that we already pay for through the nose. And the message to 
Elton is: Quit playing partisan politics and get on with the job of 
representing the citizens of Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 The military bases in Ventura County are not insignificant to the economic 
structure of this county and if they are closed during Elton Gallegly's watch, 
the voters will not soon forget.

 I would like to see all residents of Port Hueneme who work at either of the 
two bases send $5 for each person in the household working on the base to the 
BRAC 95 Task Force at 5000 Santa Rosa Road, Suite B-471, Camarillo, CA 93012. 
</P>
<P>
 I believe the residents need to show their support for the task force. There 
are, according to the county, 5,000 people with a Port Hueneme address who work 
on one of the two Navy bases: 5,000 x $5 = $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 That would go a long way to help the task force raise enough money to hire the 
Washington consultants that will help keep these bases off the list and from 
being added to the list. 
</P>
<P>
 As my husband works at CBC, I have put my money in the mail. I hope all the 
residents who work on one of the bases will do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's make it clear: Port Hueneme supports the BRAC 95 Task Force's efforts.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; COUNCIL TO CONSIDER LOW-COST HOME PLAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Oxnard City Council will hold a special meeting at 1:30 p.m. today to 
listen to a proposal by real estate speculator Donald T. Kojima for building 
115 low-cost homes on a city-owned 41-acre parcel. 
</P>
<P>
 The impromptu meeting, which was not announced until noon Monday, came as a 
surprise to farm worker advocates, who were denied the chance this month to 
submit alternate proposals at the same time as Kojima. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am absolutely surprised because I don't know what is going to be 
discussed," said Eileen McCarthy of California Rural Legal Assistance. "I also 
don't know what is being discussed that could warrant a meeting with only 24 
hours notice." 
</P>
<P>
 Kojima said he was just as surprised about the special meeting, which he did 
not learn about until he received a call from a city official Monday. He 
declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez said that the council is not meeting Nov. 29, and 
its members wanted to see what Kojima has put together before outgoing 
Councilman Michael A. Plisky has to step down from office Dec. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the last opportunity that Mike will have to take part in it," Lopez 
said. "He has been involved in this project for years." 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a $5.32-million land deal between Kojima and Oxnard, city officials 
agreed to give the developer first crack at submitting a proposal to build 115 
low-cost homes on the property he had just sold the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was conceived as a way to relocate the residents of the Oxnard 
Mobilehome Lodge, one of the county's worst slums, by building them a new place 
to live. But the homes that Kojima originally proposed were criticized by farm 
worker advocates as too expensive, and the council vowed to provide less-costly 
homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopez said Kojima, who was supposed to present his proposal to a postponed 
council meeting Nov. 15, has had plenty of time to compile a plan. MIGUEL

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; PHYSICIAN TO STAND TRIAL IN FEUD PRANKS 
</P>

<P>
 A Ventura County judge on Monday ordered a physician to stand trial on charges 
that he ordered a refrigerator in the name of a Camarillo attorney he has a 
grudge against and sent it to her office. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, the county grand jury indicted Dr. Reynaldo Fong on seven criminal 
counts for ordering thousands of magazine subscriptions in the name of the 
attorney, Theresa McConville. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard E. Simon said Fong of Salinas faces arraignment 
Dec. 6 on charges of false personation, theft and credit-card fraud. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earlier indictment, he was charged with seven counts of false 
personation in connection with allegedly sending the magazine subscriptions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong, 44, became angry at McConville about 10 years ago because she worked at 
a law firm that reported him to the state Board of Medical Quality Assurance. 
Fong had been fired from Santa Paula Hospital for double billing insurance 
companies, prosecutors said, and in retaliation referred medical malpractice 
suits from the hospital to various law firms. McConville's law firm refused to 
take his cases and reported him to the state agency. 
</P>
<P>
 After the indictment, he ordered the refrigerator in the attorney's name and 
sent it to her office Aug. 9, Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He just keeps doing it," the prosecutor said. "I'll probably be getting 
magazines when this case is over." DWAYNE BRAY

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; PACK-RAT RELEASED PENDING INVESTIGATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Pack-Rat, the former homeless man arrested on suspicion of burglary after 
making headlines by finding a place to live, was released from Ventura County 
Jail on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Municipal Judge Vincent J. O'Neill Jr. told Ray Mahala, the self-proclaimed 
"Chief of the Ventura River Bottom," that he was free to go for the time being 
because prosecutors have not finished investigating the case against him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahala, 55, may be called back to court if prosecutors decide there is enough 
evidence to charge him with stealing 67 compact discs and a small amount of 
cash from a Ventura business. 
</P>
<P>
 Police began searching for a suspect in August, when an Ojai music store owner 
complained that an unidentified man had sold him 61 CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 After a picture of Mahala appeared in a newspaper three weeks ago, the 
businessman told Ventura police that Mahala was the man who sold him the CDs. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahala was arrested on Thursday, when he went to the Ventura Police Station to 
find out why officers had been trying to locate him. 
</P>
<P>
 In court Monday, Deputy Dist. Atty. Lisa Frawley told the judge that her 
office is still investigating Mahala but has not decided whether the case 
merits criminal charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Mahala has maintained his innocence. DWAYNE BRAY

FATE OF RIVER BOTTOM DWELLERS IS DEBATED; VENTURA: DOWNTOWN MERCHANTS SAY 
TRANSIENTS BOTHER CUSTOMERS. HOMELESS ADVOCATES URGE DELAY UNTIL ALL 200 CAN BE 
RELOCATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With downtown merchants pleading for relief from transients, and homeless 
advocates urging delay, the Ventura City Council debated a proposal Monday 
night to kick the homeless out of the Ventura River bottom.  
</P>
<P>
 "They look bad, they are dirty, they stink and they are drunk half the time," 
said Dee Frisbie, owner of a downtown pizza parlor, in an interview during the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clyde Reynolds, director of an agency that assists the mentally ill 
homeless, urged delay until the city can relocate all 200 river bottom 
squatters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am concerned that a certain group of people may be scapegoated for problems 
in the downtown area," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had not taken a vote by late evening, and numerous speakers were 
waiting to comment on a plan to relocate all homeless people from a two-mile 
stretch of the river bottom -- beginning as early as this winter. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's housing committee -- composed of Jack Tingstrom, Rosa Lee 
Measures and Jim Monahan -- had worked on the plan for months. The three 
committee members say they hope it will not only clean out the river bottom but 
also remove panhandlers and other transients from downtown streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But three council members not on the housing committee have expressed concerns 
that the proposal is not legally sound. 
</P>
<P>
 City Atty. Pete Bulens had warned the committee that the city could be setting 
itself up for a lawsuit if it does not provide adequate, alternative housing 
for the squatters once it kicks them out of the river bottom.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The committee's proposal, however, has strong support from the downtown 
merchants who complain that the river homeless wander downtown during business 
hours and disturb their customers. 
</P>
<P>
 But some homeless advocates say the plan may violate river bottom dwellers' 
civil rights by moving them out of their settlements but giving them nowhere 
else to go. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, the housing committee worked with homeless advocates and city police 
on a plan for a homeless campground away from the river bottom. That would have 
given the displaced transients a roof over their heads and access to crucial 
social services.  
</P>
<P>
 But this fall, committee members decided that Ventura could not afford to pay 
for a campground, and they scaled the plan back. As it stands, the relocation 
would move about 200 squatters out of the river bottom encampment in a phased 
plan.  
</P>
<P>
 The first phase, which could begin as early as this winter, includes 
advertising available services and notifying river bottom residents that they 
must soon leave the area.

ACTOR WAS ONE OF 2 MEN KILLED IN DRAG-RACE FIGHT

<P>
 Dedrick Gobert, an actor in the movie "Boyz N the Hood," was one of two men 
shot to death in a fight over a weekend drag-race, authorities said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Gobert, 22, of Inglewood, and Ignacio Hernandez, 19, of Rosemead, were killed 
early Saturday on an isolated road in the Mira Loma area north of here, said a 
spokesman for the Riverside County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old girl was hospitalized with a gunshot wound in the neck. 
</P>
<P>
 Gobert was in the supporting cast of writer-director John Singleton's "Boyz N 
the Hood," released in 1991. Gobert's other credits included the 1993 movie 
"Poetic Justice," starring Janet Jackson, and "Higher Learning," which is 
scheduled for release in January, according to Singleton's New Deal 
Productions. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputies responding to a 2:20 a.m. shooting report found Gobert and Hernandez 
dead in the roadway on Etiwanda Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman said about 40 people had gathered for illegal drag-races, and a race 
between Gobert and another man led to an argument. Hernandez was attacked when 
he tried to help Gobert, Lohman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators were looking for a man believed to have fled in a 1993 or 1994 
Honda Prelude.

SCROOGE PAYS VISIT TO GOLDMAN, SACHS & CO.; WALL STREET: FIRM SAYS SHARPLY 
LOWER PROFITS, DOWN 80% SINCE 1993, WILL MEAN BIG CUT IN YEAR-END BONUSES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Goldman, Sachs & Co., the most affluent firm on Wall Street, is doling out the 
lowest bonuses in recent memory to a majority of its employees this year, a 
sure sign of a grim Christmas on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In an internal memo circulated Monday, Goldman said it will pay year-end 
bonuses equal to 8% of salary for most of its 9,000 work force who aren't 
partners and earn most of their pay from salary. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman told employees in the memo the move was prompted by sharply lower 
profits this year. Wall Street sources estimate that Goldman's profits are 
plunging 80% from 1993's record $2.3 billion amid a bond market downturn akin 
to the 1987 crash in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Goldman paid 30% bonuses. In the previous three years, Goldman paid 
year-end bonuses averaging 23%. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldman, Wall Street's last major private partnership, does not publicly 
disclose its earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Other investment banks are expected to follow the lead of Goldman. Its fiscal 
year ends Nov. 30, and it is among the first major Wall Street firms to 
calculate year-end bonuses. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street firms have suffered mightily this past year from the sharp rise in 
interest rates that began in February. Reeling from huge losses, Salomon 
Brothers Inc. announced a change in employee pay that would sharply cut 
compensation during times of weak earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason for (Goldman's) competitors to be paying substantially 
more," said Edward S. Orchant, president of A-L Associates, a Wall Street 
recruiting firm. "Over the past month or so all of the major Wall Street 
players have ratcheted down bonus expectations." 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors that compensation would be cut sharply this year have circulated for 
weeks at Goldman, which also is reducing its work force by 5% to cut costs. But 
the meagerness of the bonus was considered a surprise. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike other industries where bonuses just about cover the cost of Christmas 
presents, Wall Streeters rely on huge year-end sweeteners for such big-ticket 
purchases as houses and cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The 8% bonus, payable on Dec. 16, was lower than in recent memory at Goldman. 
But in the early 1970s, bonuses in that range were typical, a source close to 
the firm said.

 Short-Term T-Bill Rates Higher: The Treasury Department sold $13.7 billion of 
new three-month bills at an average discount rate of 5.40%, up from 5.29% last 
week. Another $13.7 billion of new six-month bills at an average discount rate 
of 5.85%, up from 5.72%, was sold.The three-month bill rate was the highest 
since they sold for 5.51% on Aug. 5, 1991. The six-month bill rate was the 
highest since they averaged 5.91% on March 11, 1991. The new discount rates 
understate the actual return to investors -- 5.55% for three-month bills with a 
$10,000 bill selling for $9,865, and 6.11% for a six-month bill selling for 
$9,705.90. The discount rate reflects the price discount received when 
government securities are purchased at less than face value.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: LOSSES CONTINUE FOR LIVE ENTERTAINMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Live Entertainment Inc., a troubled Van Nuys videocassette distributor, saw 
its losses widen in the third quarter after its proposed merger with Carolco 
Pictures Inc. crumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three months that ended Sept. 30, Live lost $6.63 million, double its 
year-earlier loss of $3.28 million.Its third-quarter sales fell 12%, to $33.8 
million from $38.6 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Live officials said the lower sales reflected fewer video rental releases and 
the absence of any video that went directly to sales. The third-quarter loss 
also included about $540,000 in expenses from the canceled merger deal and a 
$1.56-million reserve related to a receivable owned by Carolco. 
</P>
<P>
 For the recent nine-month period, Live reported a loss of $10.8 million, while 
its sales declined 21% to $81.3 million. A year before, it lost $5.55 million 
on $103.3 million in sales.

REGIONAL EARNINGS: VIDEO GAME COMPANY THQ'S LOSSES WIDEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 THQ Inc., a Calabasas-based maker of video games and equipment, reported 
bigger losses in the third quarter that ended Sept. 30 as the company struggled 
to rein in costs and develop new products. 
</P>
<P>
 THQ reported a loss of $2.95 million in the latest quarter, 32% larger than 
the $2.24-million loss a year earlier.Sales in the third quarter totaled $1.36 
million, down sharply from $6.95 million in the third quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first nine months of the year, THQ reported a loss of $7.77 million on 
sales of $8.95 million, compared to a year-earlier loss of $5.7 million on 
sales of $24.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said no new video game titles were released in the third quarter. 
Four new products were released in the third quarter of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Cost-cutting measures reduced selling, general and administrative expenses by 
$1.15 million in the third quarter, and the company said it has completed a 
private placement of 3.5 million shares of common stock generating proceeds of 
$1.75 million. The company said the cash will be used to market and manufacture 
a video game modem that will enable playing across telephone lines.

BREAKING INTO THE BROKERAGE BUSINESS; TRAINING: INROADS INC. OFFERS MINORITY 
STUDENTS INTERNSHIPS AT MAJOR SECURITIES COMPANIES.

<P>
 The past two years at Prudential Securities Inc. have been busy for Victor 
Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 He's done research and analysis of mortgage-backed securities and their 
prices, endured rotations on both the bond and equities trading desks, and 
tackled assignments in the firm's capital markets group. 
</P>
<P>
 Through it all, few colleagues outside his immediate work areas knew that 
Smith -- currently a senior at Columbia University -- was an intern, and not a 
regular, permanent member of Prudential's staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "They accepted me as an associate and as a professional," Smith, 20, said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, an economics major who will graduate in May, is one of dozens of 
minority students throughout the country who are breaking into the securities 
business through a national program called Inroads, headquartered in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 Inroads Inc. is a nonprofit group that helps African American, Hispanic and 
Native American college students gain access to corporate America. 
</P>
<P>
 Its efforts are gaining ground at a time when Wall Street is under pressure to 
hire more minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 Organizers say that by providing the students with valuable real-life work 
experience, they will be more employable -- and more likely to land jobs with 
their sponsoring companies. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our mission is to develop and place talented minority youth in business and 
industry and prepare them for corporate and community leadership," said Charles 
Story, president and chief executive of Inroads Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Inroads has been around for more than two decades, but it's only been in 
recent years that the internship program has begun making serious headway in 
the brokerage business. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1985, the company set up a branch at 120 Wall Street, said Thomas Powell, 
managing director of Inroads, New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, more than a dozen securities firms are training Inroads interns, 
including Merrill Lynch & Co.; Goldman, Sachs & Co.; Dean Witter Reynolds; 
Alex. Brown & Sons Inc.; and Morgan Stanley Group Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Inroads' efforts to increase minority hiring in the securities business and 
elsewhere comes as a federal commission continues its investigation of 
discrimination on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 In September, the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights held hearings that focused 
on training programs and entrepreneurial and employment opportunities for women 
and minorities on Wall Street. 
</P>
<P>
 After a preliminary study, the commission said last month that women and 
minorities are severely under-represented in the securities industry in the New 
York area, especially compared to other sectors of financial services, such as 
insurance and banking. 
</P>
<P>
 That finding didn't surprise Inroads executives. 
</P>
<P>
 Powell, the group's New York managing director, said his organization has 
noted similar patterns at the training level. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission's study also concluded that even when women and minorities were 
hired, they were likely to work in lower-paying clerical areas and not in 
management posts or high-paying areas such as investment banking. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a situation that Inroads, and some securities concerns, would like to 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Formed in 1970, Inroads started with just 25 students and 17 participating 
businesses. This year, the organization placed more than 5,400 interns at 800 
U.S. companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 686 Inroads interns who graduated from college in 1993, 399 of them, or 
58%, were offered jobs by their sponsors; 307 accepted.

BLOOD MONEY; MEDICINE: TINY HEMACARE HAS A POTENTIALLY PROMISING PLASMA 
TECHNIQUE IN THE FIGHT AGAINST AIDS. BUT THE COMPANY NEEDS $10 MILLION MORE TO 
FINISH THE PROJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JILL LEOVY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the fight against AIDS, it's often easier to drum up hope than money. 
That's been the experience at HemaCare Corp., a small, money-losing 
blood-plasma products company now at a turning point in its struggle to fund 
research on a potential treatment for AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not intended as a cure or a vaccine. The treatment involves what is known 
as passive hyperimmune plasma therapy. Whole plasma, the liquid part of blood 
that contains proteins, is taken from donors who are HIV-positive but are in 
the earliest stages of the disease and have healthy immune systems. The plasma 
is sterilized, then infused into other patients whose AIDS is further advanced 
and whose immune systems are failing, in hopes of slowing the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Some doctors and AIDS patients, tired of waiting for a so-called magic bullet 
against AIDS, say anything that shows some sign of helping should be pursued. 
HemaCare has "got a promising HIV therapy and it's been held up in development 
because the company is undercapitalized," said Dr. Paula Sparti, a physician in 
Miami who treats AIDS patients. "This should go forward, and it's not going 
forward clearly because of money." 
</P>
<P>
 Since buying rights to the therapy -- called Immupath -- in 1989 from 
Montreal-based Medicorp Inc., HemaCare has plowed nearly $8.5 million into its 
development. The company has lost money four straight years, as the research 
costs absorbed profits from its main business of collecting plasma and 
platelets from donors to sell to hospitals and providing mobile treatment 
services for blood-disorder patients. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year HemaCare lost $2.5 million on revenues of $11.8 million, and through 
the first nine months of this year it lost another $1.6 million on revenue of 
$8.2 million. 
</P>
<P>
 And before the next and most expensive phase of research can go forward, 
HemaCare must persuade investors to pony up another $10 million to complete the 
final phase of human trials before going to the Food and Drug Administration 
for approval of the treatment. Meanwhile, HemaCare's current cash reserves are 
only about $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Promising results from clinical trials on 220 patients in 1991 were presented 
to a conference of scientists in New York last month. HemaCare's CEO Hal 
Lieberman concedes that a dearth of capital has slowed research, but he says 
the firm won't give up. "This is too good a product to walk away from," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has held discussions with several potential partners, Lieberman 
said, although it has failed in past years to find the right partner. 
</P>
<P>
 HemaCare's research has drawn the attention of hundreds of AIDS patients, 
including some so convinced of its merits that they volunteered as guinea pigs 
for the human trials, thus giving HemaCare the most precious thing they have: 
their time. 
</P>
<P>
 The therapy is based on the observation that people with the human 
immunodeficiency virus can stay healthy for years before their immune systems 
deteriorate. Investigators think the reason is that the body mounts a 
successful attack against the AIDS virus at first but is slowly overwhelmed. By 
transferring plasma from healthy, HIV-infected patients to less healthy ones, 
they hope to capture the antibodies produced in the early stages of infection 
and transfer them to patients whose immune systems are worn down. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a relatively low-tech approach to the disease, and it's certainly not a 
cure. But advocates speculate that Immupath could slow the progress of AIDS and 
reduce some of its symptoms, essentially "holding the virus in check," 
explained Dr. Joshua Levy, HemaCare's medical director, who leads Immupath 
research. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the treatment consists of infusions of proteins the body naturally 
produces, it's unlikely to create the toxic side effects of antiviral drugs, 
such as AZT, Levy contends. And because it pools different antibodies from many 
donors, the treatment may stand a better chance of remaining effective despite 
the HIV virus' constant mutations, he argues. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 HemaCare's most recent study showed some encouraging results. Only one of the 
21 people receiving the largest doses of plasma died during the yearlong study, 
while in a similar group of 21 people receiving a placebo, six died. Due to the 
results, all the participants are now receiving the therapy instead of a 
placebo and will continue even though their portion of the study has ended. 
</P>
<P>
 The company must now get approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
to go forward with testing Immupath on 400 people with AIDS. The FDA has put 
the approval on hold pending additional studies of the product's safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Dwiggins, 45, is among the HIV-positive volunteers who took part in 
the earlier study. His condition was diagnosed in 1990 and he was probably 
infected several years before. The HemaCare plasma transfusions are lengthy and 
uncomfortable, but "you feel quite energized afterward," he said. Since 
beginning the therapy, he said, his condition has remained fairly stable. 
</P>
<P>
 At least two other limited studies on passive hyperimmune therapy have 
recorded some similar effects, although one study of advanced AIDS patients in 
New York recorded no great benefit. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite some promising results, skepticism has long dogged HemaCare's efforts. 
After all, AIDS has preoccupied the world's best scientists and biggest 
medical-research companies for years, and HemaCare seems an obscure and 
unlikely contender. Moreover, Wall Street is less than enthused with HemaCare's 
recent studies. The price of HemaCare's stock has declined more than 40% since 
March of this year, and closed Monday at $3.50 per share. 
</P>
<P>
 Although HemaCare's approach is reasonable, antibodies are just one element of 
the immune system's response to infection, said Dr. Daniel Kuritzkes, assistant 
professor of medicine at the University of Colorado Health Sciences Center in 
Denver. Many scientists think they may be among the least effective of those 
mechanisms, he said. Other treatments, such as hormones that stimulate the 
immune system and gene therapies, show more promise and may prove more 
economical, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics are even more doubtful about whether wide-scale treatment of AIDS 
using passive hyperimmune therapy is feasible. For Immupath to work, HemaCare 
must have a constant stream of HIV-positive plasma donors who are willing to 
give plasma every few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Michael Roth, a Beverly Hills physician who treats AIDS patients with the 
still-experimental passive hyperimmune therapy, said the treatment appears to 
be beneficial but organizing a steady parade of donors for his practice is 
"cumbersome and time-consuming." Donors drop out, even when they are paid, and 
replacements must be recruited. "This will never be a large-scale treatment. . 
. . You can't mass-produce it like a pill," Roth said. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial analysts also doubt that this treatment will ever be a big 
moneymaker for HemaCare, even if it is effective. "The issue is not, will it 
work? It is, will it be practical?" said Joyce Lonergan, a biotechnology 
analyst with Cowen & Co. in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 HemaCare's Lieberman countered that organizing a national system of donor 
centers is exactly the sort of thing HemaCare -- a blood and plasma company -- 
does best. 
</P>
<P>
 "This drug will be expensive but so is getting sick," Lieberman said, adding 
that the treatment could cost about $1,000 per month per patient. "What we are 
doing is cumbersome and expensive. . . . But there isn't anything else." 
</P>
<P>
 The company is also considering testing a related product called intravenous 
immune gamma globulin -- in essence, a distillation of antibodies derived from 
human plasma. HemaCare is building a production plant in Valencia to 
mass-produce treated whole plasma as well as the more concentrated immune gamma 
globulin. 
</P>
<P>
 But, of course, for all this to happen HemaCare needs more money and 
encouraging results both in the lab and on Wall Street.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: COMPANY TOWN; KATZENBERG REPORTEDLY TRYING TO LURE 
TELEVISION HEAVYWEIGHT; WORD IS THAT 'DREAM TEAM' IS AFTER MATT WILLIAMS TO 
JOIN NEW COMPANY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that most of the hyperbole has run its course, Hollywood's so-called Dream 
Team seems to be getting down to business. Sources say Jeffrey Katzenberg is 
putting one of his famous full-court presses on big-time TV producer Matt 
Williams to join the new company. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams developed two of TV's biggest current hits, "Roseanne" and "Home 
Improvement," and is counted among the industry's savviest creative executives. 
Sources say Katzenberg wants Williams to help jump-start TV operations at the 
new company, which is still unnamed. 
</P>
<P>
 Katzenberg declined to comment on the report, except to point out that he and 
his high-profile partners -- Steven Spielberg and David Geffen -- are in a 
flurry of business discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for Williams' Wind Dancer Production Group called the speculation 
premature, adding: "Like a lot of companies, we're taking a wait-and-see 
approach to this new venture because there really isn't enough information 
available yet to accurately assess the value of that organization, other than 
the tremendous experience and clout of the three principals." 
</P>
<P>
 One Hollywood theory is that Katzenberg is mainly positioning himself for the 
time when Williams and other desirable executives become available. While most 
of the media attention has focused on the Dream Team's film and music plans, 
Katzenberg is equally committed to TV. Sources say the company has quietly 
hired entertainment attorney Skip Brittenham of Ziffren, Brittenham & Branca to 
help develop a strategy for exploiting opportunities on the tube. 
</P>
<P>
 Rumors involving Williams are also being fueled by news that he recently 
parted ways with his longtime attorney, Ernest Del of Del, Rubel in favor of 
power lawyer Barry Hirsch. A company spokesman, however, said the change is 
mainly tied to other business matters. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams and his partners, Carmen Finestra and David McFadzean, have a year to 
go on an exclusive production deal with ABC and on a separate distribution deal 
with Walt Disney Studios. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Wind Dancer is also based on the Disney lot in Burbank. Disney, which is known 
to be extraordinarily sensitive to the issue of former studio chief Katzenberg 
raiding talent, declined to comment on the Williams rumor. Sources, however, 
agreed that Williams would be an obvious choice to eventually join the 
Katzenberg-Spielberg-Geffen company. 
</P>
<P>
 He and Katzenberg had a close working relationship at Disney, and Williams has 
been on Katzenberg's famous whitewater rafting-bonding expedition for Hollywood 
executives. Both men also have close ties to ABC, where Katzenberg is said to 
be targeting TV proposals. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams has profited handsomely from the TV business, having been guaranteed 
$10 million from a three-year 1989 deal with Disney alone. Williams' other 
current show, "Thunder Alley," is expected back on ABC this spring. He is also 
developing a spinoff of "Home Improvement," the top-rated prime-time program. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In other Katzenberg news, Hollywood faxes were burning up Monday with a parody 
update of the ex-studio chief's legendary memo on the state of the film 
industry. Under the heading of "Business Plan for My Company," the Katzenberg 
impersonator heralds the need to wring every dollar out of employees and 
creative talent to ensure the success of the Dream Team. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo goes on to state that "unlike other flash-in-the-pan executives, my 
power does not stem from my office, it comes from me. No matter where I sit, I 
radiate that power." 
</P>
<P>
 The faux Katzenberg also denies the rap that he doesn't share credit with 
others.  
</P>
<P>
 "When the live action divisions at Disney went into their downward tumble, I 
was quick to share the credit with my chief lieutenants," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Good taste and common sense argue against quoting any further from the "memo," 
which skewers Katzenberg in a fairly vicious way. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Disney, meanwhile, is poised to announce record profits for the fiscal year 
ended Sept. 30, despite all the tragedy and turmoil that has engulfed the 
entertainment company over the last year. Sources say Disney will report nearly 
$2 billion in operating income. 
</P>
<P>
 The news, which will come as no surprise to Wall Street, still runs counter to 
recent publicity surrounding the company's many crises -- including President 
Frank Wells' death, Chairman Michael D. Eisner's subsequent emergency quadruple 
bypass surgery, Katzenberg's volatile exit and Disney's failed plans to build a 
historic theme park in Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment analysts say the lion's share of the success, so to speak, is 
owed to animation. The year's major events included the theatrical release of 
"The Lion King" and the video release of "Aladdin." Animated films also drove 
Disney's marketing business. The major sore spot for Disney was the theme park 
business -- which remains soft everywhere. 
</P>
<P>
 Jill S. Krutick of Smith Barney in New York and Jeffrey Logsdon of Seidler 
Cos. in Los Angeles are both projecting that Disney will report operating 
income of roughly $810 in filmed entertainment, $430 million in consumer 
products and $695 million for theme parks. 
</P>
<P>
 While Logsdon has a "buy" recommendation on Disney stock and Krutick's 
recommendation is neutral, some analysts remain troubled by the company's 
perceived lack of management depth. "The concerns over management have not 
entirely dissipated," Krutick said. "They still have to fill the chief 
financial officer position, and they have had a fair bit of turmoil. We view 
the company as one that's going through a transition." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Said another analyst: "If many of the people you relate to in the company are 
now gone, there's unease. Are the natives restless? No, because there are no 
natives left." 
</P>
<P>
 Disney denies there's an executive void and says things look promising for the 
coming year as well. "The Lion King" continues its theatrical run and will show 
up in video. The studio's next animated feature, "Pocahontas," comes out this 
summer. "Home Improvement" is going into the syndication market. "Beauty and 
the Beast on Broadway" is being prepped for the international market. And 
Disney has plans for several new theme park attractions, as well as a revised 
marketing campaign.

BRIEFCASE: TOURISM; KNOTT'S BERRY FARM READIES TURKEY AND FIXINGS FOR BIG

 If you think that making Thanksgiving dinner is a major undertaking, consider 
the task at Knott's Berry Farm. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Farm" expects to serve 10,000 turkey dinners Thursday, as well as a few 
hundred of its famous chicken dinners. That means instead of having to worry 
about one turkey in the oven like at most homes, Knott's has to fret over more 
than 500.

 After Mother's Day, Thanksgiving is the second most popular "eating" day of 
the year at Knott's. It's also a great chance for Knott's to show off its theme 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 About half of the diners in the Buena Park landmark's three restaurants will 
also purchase admission to the theme park. Many will simply stroll the 
Christmas crafts village in Ghost Town before or after dinner, said Knott's 
spokesman Bob Ochsner. 
</P>
<P>
 Reservations are required at Knott's for dinner, and while some will be seated 
without reservations, there won't be many. Hotel Dinner: Hotels are picking up 
some of the Thanksgiving slack. The Pan Pacific Hotel, near Disneyland, is 
offering turkey dinners -- or a choice of several other entrees -- on 
Thanksgiving. As one might expect, its Japanese restaurant is closed Thursday. 
Disneyland Festivities: Thanksgiving also marks the start of another Christmas 
season at Disneyland, where the park plans to stage both its "Very Merry 
Christmas Parade" and "The Lion King" parade that proved so popular over the 
summer. The Christmas parade will march through twice a day while "The Lion 
King" will make a single pass. At the Disneyland Hotel, bakers and decorators 
were putting the finishing touches on a seven-foot gingerbread house covered in 
cookies, candies and frosting. The gardens around the 60-acre resort hotel will 
be festooned with lights, garland and Christmas trees. Even the Disney 
characters will don Thanksgiving garb for the hotel's holiday buffet. 
Charitable Red Lion: In the spirit of holiday giving, the Red Lion Hotel in 
Costa Mesa has created a social club dedicated to raising money for Orange 
County charities. The Orange Garde, as the club is known, will hand out 
membership benefits such as preferred seating in Maxi's Grille at the hotel, 
free valet parking while dining, corporate room rates and a 20% discount on 
gift shop purchases. Members will also be invited to golf tournaments, wine 
tasting parties and other special events. The one-time initiation fee of $50 
includes an engraved silver goblet. Ten percent of the food and beverage 
purchases from Maxi's Grille will be donated to charity, with a goal of raising 
$15,000 to $20,000 over the next year. "It's a unique approach to supporting 
community organizations," General Manager Emmett Steed said. Going to Market: 
An Orange County-based business consultant offers some advice to hotel industry 
executives: Put marketing first and know your market. "You have to do some 
research. There are no quick fixes," said Y.N. Chang of Orange, author of 
"Revitalizing America's Business: A Brilliant Six-Action Style to Manage and 
Succeed." Chang said that every manager needs to evaluate how their properties 
stack up to industry leaders. For quality, look to Disneyland. "When you walk 
into Disneyland, there are so many things to attract your attention," he said. 
For customer service, look to Nordstrom. Hotels should not just build on new 
rooms. They should renovate, become the best in their category and then build 
additional lodging, according to Chang.

 CDB Infotek, a privately held information services company in Santa Ana, has 
agreed to acquire Simon & Schuster's Prentice Hall Online and Charles E. Simon 
Co. units, officials for the companies said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The businesses were put up for sale in April after Simon & Schuster decided to 
focus on consumer, education, reference and international publishing as its 
core operations.Terms of the sales were not disclosed.  
</P>
<P>
 CDB Infotek, with 120 employees in Orange County, provides on-line public 
records information services to the legal, insurance, corporate and 
investigative industries. The acquisitions will add about 80 workers in 
Southern California and increase annual revenue by 35%, said Rick Rozar, 
president of the company.  
</P>
<P>
 "This allows up to penetrate markets we haven't been in," Rozar said, "such as 
the financial institutions." 
</P>
<P>
 Prentice Hall Online, which specializes in court and tax lien records, is 
based in Irvine. Charles E. Simon Co., which specializes in information from 
government records and Securities and Exchange Commission filings, is based in 
Washington.

AST STOCK UP AFTER ANALYST'S FORECAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Shares of AST Research Inc. rose as much as 11.5% Monday after an analyst 
predicted the Irvine computer maker would return to profitability by March.  
</P>
<P>
 AST stock prices increased $1.22 a share in heavy Nasdaq trading, closing at 
$14.19 a share.At one point the stock reached a high of $14.50 a share. 
</P>
<P>
 After reaching highs of $33 a share earlier this year, AST stock has fallen as 
much as 60%. The company has suffered delayed product introductions, 
manufacturing problems and industry price cuts that led to a nearly $40-million 
loss for the three months ended Sept. 30.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think they've seen the worst," said Jim Poyner, an analyst with Oppenheimer 
& Co., a brokerage firm in New York, who released a bullish report on the 
company Monday. "The odds of them returning to profitability in the March 
quarter look pretty good."  
</P>
<P>
 Poyner said the company is reducing its expenses and getting new products out 
on time. He said that he spoke with management at AST last week and was told 
that the company plans to cut 200 additional jobs by the end of March, a move 
that will further reduce operating expenses. In October, AST said it planned to 
cut about 700 employees, about 440 of whom were in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 A robust holiday season for computer sales also may help the company, he 
added.

PLAZA HOME MORTGAGE REPORTS $10.2-MILLION 3RD-QUARTER LOSS; FINANCE: DOWNTURN 
IN BUSINESS AND INTERNAL ACCOUNTING CHANGES ARE BLAMED. SALE OF THE COMPANY IS 
IN JEOPARDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES S. GRANELLI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Plaza Home Mortgage Corp. said Monday that it lost $10.2 million for the third 
quarter -- much more than expected -- and that the loss significantly weakened 
the financial condition of its savings and loan subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterly loss of 87 cents a share also puts in jeopardy the pending 
$120-million sale of the company to Fleet National Bank, though a press release 
said that "many components" of the red ink "do not adversely affect" Plaza's 
financial condition under sale terms. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement, however, said that various financial "benchmarks" needed to 
complete the deal early next year are subject to the deteriorating mortgage 
banking market and to the company's future performance. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman John T. French would not comment Monday about the latest bad news for 
the company, which also had to restate its tiny $21,000 first-quarter profit 
and its $9.8-million loss for the second quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives at Fleet's parent company, Fleet Financial Group Inc. in 
Providence, R.I., also would not comment about any effect Plaza's results may 
have on its acquisition offer of $10.125 a share in cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza, the nation's 13th-largest mortgage lender last year and a major lender 
in poor and minority areas, saw its stock price fall 25 cents a share Monday to 
close at $7.5625 in Nasdaq trading. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The continuing rise in interest rates this year had iced the market for 
fixed-rate loans, a staple in the mortgage banking business. Plaza Home 
Mortgage Bank in Santa Ana, the company's primary subsidiary, has been one of 
the few thrifts to devote itself entirely to mortgage banking, which is the 
funding and selling of home loans. 
</P>
<P>
 The quarterly loss, more than twice the $4.9-million loss in last year's third 
quarter, was much greater than the anticipated shortfall of $5.8 million to 
$6.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Together with restated earnings for the first two quarters, the third-quarter 
loss led Plaza to drop $20.1 million, or $1.71 a share, for the first nine 
months this year, contrasted with a profit of $1.3 million, or 11 cents a 
share, for the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza's quarterly loss was bad, but, considering the state of the mortgage 
banking industry, "it should have been bad," said Gary Gordon, an analyst with 
the brokerage PaineWebber in New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a little worse than I had expected, but there are some explanations 
for it." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss was caused partly by the huge downturn in business and partly by the 
company's effort to "clean" its balance sheet by, for instance, recognizing 
increased costs and losses from its acquisition last year of an Albuquerque, 
N.M., mortgage servicing company. Servicing is the business of billing 
borrowers and collecting payments for a fee. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza, which originated $2.2 billion in loans in last year's third quarter, 
funded only $749.2 million in loans in this year's third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Its $3.5 billion in loans for the first nine months is 38% lower than its $5.6 
billion in loans funded during the same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's total loans and other assets ballooned 47% to $1.1 billion at 
the end of September from $749.8 million a year earlier. That, coupled with its 
losses, put a strain on the thrift's ratio of capital -- its final reserve 
against losses -- to assets. 
</P>
<P>
 The thrift now is "significantly undercapitalized," according to federal 
standards, and must raise its level of capital or reduce its assets. The thrift 
would not release its capital ratio, but the federal category it is in puts the 
ratio at below 3%. A ratio of 5% would make it well capitalized. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Reducing assets, usually easy to do, may be more difficult for Plaza. The 
thrift is a major player in mortgage loan servicing, and its acquisition would 
make Fleet the second-largest servicer in the nation. The sale agreement with 
Fleet limits Plaza's ability to sell its servicing rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza had a net gain of only $2.2 million on the sale of servicing rights 
during the third quarter, far below the $14.1 million gain in last year's third 
quarter. Its year-to-date gains are running 63% below last year's. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza has only one full-service thrift branch, which is in Santa Ana, but it 
conducts mortgage banking activities through 41 loan centers in 13 states.

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: NEW HIGH-RISE IN WORKS FOR OXNARD'S FINANCIAL PLAZA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Jack Searles 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martin V. (Bud) Smith, the dean of Ventura County's commercial real estate 
developers, says he's close to launching his latest project -- a 15-story, 
330,000-square-foot office building in Oxnard's Financial Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The new structure would be the third high-rise in the plaza, a 
million-square-foot complex off the Ventura Freeway that is wholly owned by 
Smith's company, Martin V. Smith & Associates. If all goes according to plan, 
construction will start next year and the building will open its doors by the 
end of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial Plaza's largest towers, the 22-story Union Bank Building and the 
15-story Ventura County National Bank Building, are 94% occupied, and Smith is 
convinced that it's time to make room for more tenants. "We've completed the 
permit process and we've spent a couple of hundred thousand dollars on plans," 
he says of his newest project. "All we're waiting for now is a major tenant." 
</P>
<P>
 On Smith's behalf, commercial real estate brokers are approaching Eastern 
insurance companies and other firms, some in California, that might occupy at 
least 25% of the planned high-rise. As part of the deal, the building would be 
named for the tenant. "The banks like to see a large chunk of space leased 
before you break ground," Smith concedes. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, 78, has become a multimillionaire through shrewd judgment and an 
unwavering faith in the Oxnard Plain. He moved to Oxnard 50 years ago, 
operating a restaurant called the Colonial House. The city's population then 
was 8,000. Today, it's more than 150,000. "When my friends in L. A. asked where 
my restaurant was, I told them it was between Malibu and Montecito. Most of 
them didn't know Oxnard existed." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith got into development but was different from most builders in that he 
held onto his projects instead of selling them to others. Today, he has 2,000 
business and residential tenants in properties throughout Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Financial Plaza, he owns Fishermen's Wharf and the 
Peninsula Yacht Anchorage at Oxnard's Channel Islands Harbor, a couple of 
shopping centers and a string of hotels, including the Oxnard Hilton, between 
Calabasas and Santa Maria. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has his own railroad, the Ventura County Railway, which carries 
imported autos and other freight from the Port of Hueneme to the Southern 
Pacific connection in Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things have definitely been looking up the last 60 days," Smith says of 
Ventura County's economy. "One sign of that is that we've been turning people 
away who want to rent space in our warehouses. Every inch is rented." 
</P>
<P>
 As for his hundreds of apartment units, the vacancy rate is under 3%, he 
reports. "A lot of the apartments are rented to Navy families. We'd be hurt if 
our bases were to be closed, but not as badly as some people fear. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Navy pulled out of Point Mugu, for instance, I think that would make 
it more feasible to establish a major commercial airport there. The net result 
for the county's economy might not be so bad." 
</P>
<P>
 What, then, is Bud Smith's forecast for the county that made him rich? 
</P>
<P>
 His answer: "Five years from now, people will be asking themselves, 'Why 
didn't I do more five years ago?' "

VENTURA COUNTY REVIEW: PRACTICAL PERIPHERALS' PARENT FILES CHAPTER 11 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Practical Peripherals Inc., a Thousand Oaks producer of high-speed modems, 
expects its business to continue as usual despite the filing of a Chapter 11 
bankruptcy petition by its parent. 
</P>
<P>
 The parent firm, Hayes Microcomputer Products Inc. of Norcross, Ga., sought 
bankruptcy court protection last week, saying it was having cash-flow 
difficulties at a time when demand for its products was growing, but at the 
same time the venerable modem maker was having problems from subcontractors to 
meet those orders.Modems are used to transmit data between computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nancy Stokesberry, a Practical spokeswoman, said she understood that Hayes' 
problems are short-term. "I understand they're already on the way to being 
resolved," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Practical has about 500 employees. Hayes, which is privately owned, says its 
annual sales exceed $250 million. It does not break out Practical's revenues.

FUNERAL BUSINESS KEEPS UP WITH TIMES; DEATH: CHAIN OWNERSHIP AND BARGAIN 
PACKAGES RESHAPE WHAT TRADITIONALLY HAD BEEN A FAMILY-OPERATED INDUSTRY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Death and taxes are certainties, but the funeral business is anything but a 
sure thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Once dominated by family-owned funeral homes using skills handed down for 
generations, the industry is being made over by chain-ownership. Funeral 
parlors are hiring college-trained non-relatives and offering low-cost, bargain 
packages. 
</P>
<P>
 "Consumers want more choices, and funeral directors have to offer more 
services," said Sue Daniels, spokeswoman for the National Funeral Directors 
Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten to 15 years ago, everyone did the same thing. Viewing, service, burial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now people have no visitation, or visitation without viewing, cremation with 
service or no service," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Celia Pinzi and her father, Nello, who run the West Haven Funeral Home, have 
learned to adapt to the industry's changes. 
</P>
<P>
 They handle about 240 funerals a year, but to stay alive in the increasingly 
competitive business, they also offer no-frills cremation for $926. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a method we do in addition to our own services, and I definitely see a 
need for it," Pinzi said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationwide, 22,500 funeral homes handle 2.3 million deaths annually, with each 
funeral home conducting an average of 151 services per year. According to the 
National Funeral Directors Assn., the average funeral traditionally costs more 
than $4,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But more and more funeral homes are offering no-frills cremations for less 
than $1,000, with families choosing churches or homes for memorial services 
instead of a traditional wake. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Cremation Assn. of North America, 19.11% of the people who 
died in the United States in 1992 were cremated. It is projected that by 2000, 
that figure will jump to 27%. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Carmon and his brothers own five funeral homes in Connecticut. They 
have a full-time bereavement specialist who speaks to community groups, 
colleges, high school students, church groups and others about death and dying 
and makes personal family follow-up visits. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmon also sponsors a program for widows and widowers to talk out their 
grief. 
</P>
<P>
 Funeral homes also are facing mountains of paperwork to comply with increasing 
government regulation, and many are turning to computers. 
</P>
<P>
 Director's Assistant, a software program made by Continental Computer Corp. in 
Jonesboro, Ark., offers a $1,995 basic package that includes government forms, 
sales contracts and an accounting program. 
</P>
<P>
 Businesses create their own databases of funeral details, from music to 
pallbearers. 
</P>
<P>
 A good many of the newest regulations come from the Occupational Safety and 
Health Administration, which is concerned with worker safety, such as exposure 
to chemicals and infectious disease. OSHA requires every funeral home employee, 
even part-time workers, to receive a day's training every year. 
</P>
<P>
 James Burnside of Professional Compliance Inc. of Baltimore, makes his living 
bringing funeral homes into OSHA compliance, much of it record-keeping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Funeral directors are not good 'paper' people. They're good 'people' people," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Just a few years ago, undertakers needed only two days of training. Today, 37 
states require a minimum of a two-year program in funeral service. 
</P>
<P>
 Bernard Laskowski runs Connecticut's only mortuary science program at 
Briarwood College in Southington. 
</P>
<P>
 This year the program graduated its first class. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I went to school, 90% or more of the students were coming from funeral 
service families. This first class, only two of the 22 were from family 
businesses," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many family-owned funeral homes have been selling to companies such as Service 
Corp. International, the largest funeral-home chain in the world, with 856 
homes.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: AMWEST PLANS BUYBACK OF 100,000 COMMON SHARES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amwest Insurance Group Inc., the Woodland Hills-based insurance holding 
company, said it has authorized the repurchase of 100,000 shares of its common 
stock between now and next June. 
</P>
<P>
 The company's stock has recently traded in the range of $12 per share. Steven 
Kay, chief financial officer, attributed a decline in stock price to the 
company's recent earnings, which fell short of some analysts' expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 Amwest, which specializes in contract-performance bonds, has 2.4 million 
shares outstanding. The company is in the process of selecting an agent to 
begin its repurchase of shares.

REGIONAL ROUNDUP: BABY PICTURE CONTRACTS PROVIDE BOOST FOR FIRM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Styles on Video, a Chatsworth-based company that designs and sells imaging 
systems, said it has secured new contracts that could add as much as $2 million 
to the company's 1995 revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The company said it has signed contracts with 40 hospitals in China and Hong 
Kong to supply digital cameras used in delivery rooms to take pictures of 
newborn babies. The company is responsible for arranging printing of the 
pictures and delivering them to the infants' parents within 24 hours. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Executive Guy DeVreese said the company has signed similar contracts 
with 10 hospitals in the United States, and expects to sign 20 new contracts a 
month with U. S. hospitals throughout 1995.

COMMUNITY BANKS SWIMMING AGAINST A POWERFUL CURRENT; CONSOLIDATION IS TAKING 
OVER BANKING INDUSTRY, AS MORE SMALL BANKS DISAPPEAR. THE SMALL ONES THAT 
REMAIN HOPE PERSONAL SERVICE WILL HELP THEM COMPETE AGAINST LARGER RIVALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Legend has it that when Achille Levy, founder in 1882 of Ventura-based Bank of 
A. Levy, was unsure about making a loan to a farmer, Levy would get up before 
dawn and drive his carriage to the farmer's house. If the lights were already 
on, the farmer's work ethic was proven, and he'd get the loan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few months, the lights will go out for good at Bank of A. Levy. 
Surrendering to consolidation pressures that are sweeping the banking industry, 
Levy recently agreed to sell its 17 branches and $616 million in assets to 
giant First Interstate Bancorp, which already has 1,093 branches and $53 
billion in assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Marshall Milligan, outgoing chief executive at Bank of A. Levy, and the 
great-grandson of its founder, was hardly sentimental when he explained the 
$86-million sale in a column for a local newspaper. "Community banking," he 
wrote, "is a cottage industry destined to go the way of blacksmiths and butcher 
shops." 
</P>
<P>
 Bankers at other small, independent banks in the San Fernando Valley area and 
Ventura County wince at Milligan's pessimism, and say there will always be room 
for smaller community banks that offer competitive prices and personal service. 
</P>
<P>
 But they are swimming against a powerful current. 
</P>
<P>
 As of June, there were 10,715 banks in the United States, a 26% drop since 
1984, and that number is likely to shrink even faster with the recent passage 
of the interstate banking bill, which in 1997 will knock down the few remaining 
barriers for nationwide banking chains. In California, the consolidation trend 
includes gobbling up small banks with less than $1 billion in assets: Through 
Nov. 15 of this year, 23 small banks in California have been sold, compared to 
only 10 such deals last year, according to SNL Securities, a research firm in 
Charlottesville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 Executives who do run community banks are fighting to stay independent by 
hustling for loans and deposits. 
</P>
<P>
 At Valencia National Bank in Newhall, with three branches and $79 million in 
assets, its new CEO John Reardon spends one-third of his time driving around 
the Santa Clarita Valley to meet with customers and drum up business. At 
American Pacific State Bank in Sherman Oaks, with six branches and $265 million 
in assets, CEO Frank Ures organizes lunches, golf tournaments and even vacation 
cruises to keep his customers happy. And at Ventura County National Bancorp 
(VCNB) in Oxnard, with four branches and $272 million in assets, CEO Richard 
Cupp is writing and calling Bank of A. Levy's best customers, hoping to capture 
deposits of those customers who don't want to be swallowed up by First 
Interstate. 
</P>
<P>
 But Bank of America, Wells Fargo, First Interstate and other big banks have 
built-in advantages that are hard to overcome. Large chains have vast networks 
of branches and automated teller machines to serve mobile customers. Cupp, the 
Ventura County bank CEO, conceded that his own daughter banks at Wells Fargo 
because she lives in Northern California and attends Sonoma State University. 
Every month or so, Cupp slips out of his 10th-floor office in Oxnard to the 
nearby Wells Fargo branch to put money in her account. "It's a pain," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Large banks have lower overhead costs relative to their community bank 
counterparts. Simply by closing Bank of A. Levy's headquarters, for example, 
First Interstate will cut 100 jobs and save about $4 million annually in 
payroll costs, all while absorbing Levy's former business. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, a large bank chain can more easily afford to offer high-tech banking 
services. Bank of America and Ventura County National Bank both offer services 
that allow customers from home or office computers to check their account 
balances, move funds, and perform other transactions. Bank of America charges 
$39.95 per month for this service, but VCNB charges $100 per month. 
</P>
<P>
 Large banks also cover vast territories that often encompass several states, 
thereby avoiding the geographic risks faced by community banks. American 
Pacific was poised to set an earnings record this year, until the Jan. 17 
Northridge earthquake hit, creating loan problems that could slice as much as 
$1 million from company profits that might otherwise have reached $3 million. 
"Everybody in the Midwest is making a fortune," said Ures, whose 16th-floor 
office overlooks the San Diego Freeway. "We'd have had a banner year, but the 
earthquake killed us." 
</P>
<P>
 VCNB was almost unaffected by the quake, but it barely survived the latest 
recession. Battered by loans that went sour with the troubled Southern 
California economy and real estate market, the bank lost $12.1 million last 
year, more money than the bank had made in profits the previous six years. 
</P>
<P>
 The one big weapon community banks have, their executives and customers say, 
is superior service. Strolling into the Westlake Village branch of VCNB last 
week, Karen Cozen said she gets "better personal attention" at VCNB, even 
though, unlike the Wells Fargo branch 50 feet away, VCNB is not open on 
Saturdays. "If I need money, I just get it at the supermarket or use my Visa" 
card, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Cull, a 61-year-old computer consultant, said he finds the large banks 
too impersonal. At VCNB, he said, "I'm a name and a person, not a number." 
</P>
<P>
 Cull said he has always preferred banking with community banks, but wonders 
whether someday he may have no choice. Community banks "are all being swallowed 
up," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Community banks are particularly attentive to their key customers -- 
small-business owners who pay lucrative interest rates on their loans. 
</P>
<P>
 Don Whaley operates a balloon distribution company in North Hollywood and he 
is regularly courted by Bank of America and First Interstate, but he has been 
loyal to American Pacific since 1976 partly because tellers there remember his 
name. "It's good for your ego when you walk into a bank and people recognize 
you," Whaley said. "But it's also nice business." 
</P>
<P>
 So twice a month, Ures invites up to 12 of American Pacific's best customers 
to the bank to lunch with top executives. Once a year, the bank spends $30,000 
to put on a VIP golf tournament and dinner for its biggest customers. And every 
other year, the bank organizes an invitation-only vacation cruise. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Ures cruised the Caribbean for a week with 73 customers who 
represented a combined $35 million in deposits and loans. Customers pay their 
own way on such cruises, but by the end of the trip, Ures said, "they think we 
walk on water." 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia National, which is too small to set up golf tournaments and cruises, 
instead emphasizes its community ties; last year, it donated more than $100,000 
to local chapters of the YMCA, Red Cross and other groups. The bank also 
encourages its employees to do volunteer work with the local charities. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 John Reardon, Valencia bank's 52-year-old CEO who arrived just two months ago, 
spent much of his life heading oil, real estate and banking companies in his 
native Oklahoma. Unlike the executive nests occupied by Cupp and Ures, 
Reardon's office is on the second floor of a two-story building in a tiny 
Newhall shopping center. 
</P>
<P>
 His office furniture could have been purchased at Price Club, and the floor 
creaks above the ground-floor branch directly below. 
</P>
<P>
 Reardon said he was hired partly because directors believe his affable, 
straight-shooting manner will help him shore up relations with the local 
business community. Out of necessity, he has mapped a course of low-tech, 
no-frills service. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank has ATM machines at its three branches, but eschews the computer and 
telephone banking that many banks embrace. "If someone wants a car loan, 
they're not told to call an 800 number," Reardon said. "And I can't imagine us 
ever going to voice mail." 
</P>
<P>
 Even if community banks can pick off enough local business from large bank 
chains, they still face internal pressures. After all, their business is to 
collect deposits and make loans, but they must also generate wealth for their 
shareholders, and selling a bank is often one way to make investors happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ures says the value of American Pacific's stock has risen an average of 12% 
annually since the bank was founded in 1971. But Ures said he occasionally 
feels pressure from shareholders "who have been around a long time who say, 
'When am I going to have a little cash on hand?' " To feed their appetites, 
American Pacific two weeks ago approved a 10% stock dividend and a 10-cent cash 
dividend. 
</P>
<P>
 Ures, 53, acknowledges one reason he is not interested in selling is because 
he likes his job. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fun of what we do is more important" than simply cashing out, said Ures, 
who earns more than $220,000 a year, and holds 100,000 shares of stock 
currently valued about $9 a share. Still, Ures said, "If somebody came in and 
offered $25 a share, you might have a seller." 
</P>
<P>
 VCNB was looking for a buyer earlier this year, but A. Levy's sale probably 
spoiled VCNB's chances, at least for a few years. So Cupp has focused on 
rebuilding, and the bank plans to lift its sagging capital base with a 
$5-million stock offering early next year. 
</P>
<P>
 VCNB is also counting on scooping up Levy customers who balk at being switched 
to First Interstate. Chain banks typically lose 10% to 20% of a community 
bank's deposits following an acquisition, said Mary Martha Stewart, director of 
marketing at VCNB. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank has identified 1,000 of Levy's biggest customers and inundated them 
with letters, phone calls and visits from VCNB officials, including Cupp. 
</P>
<P>
 It's too early to gauge the success of their efforts, Cupp said, but if Levy 
customers "were going to bank with First Interstate, why weren't they already 
banking with First Interstate?" 
</P>
<P>
 But First Interstate didn't buy Bank of A. Levy to watch its deposits flee, 
and Ventura County National is still limping from last year's heavy losses. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, another community bank, Santa Barbara Bank & Trust, recently said 
it too hopes to fill A. Levy's void by opening three branches in Ventura County 
over the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 The local market is already overcrowded, and some community banks will 
undoubtedly be gobbled up. Who will survive? "We're going to find out," Cupp 
said.

NATO JETS ATTACK SERBIAN REBEL GUN POSITIONS, AIR BASE; BALKANS: THE LIMITED 
RAID IS A RESPONSE TO SORTIES BY NATIONALISTS AGAINST THE BOSNIAN CITY OF 
BIHAC. ACTION IS THE FIRST UNDER A NEW POLICY AUTHORIZING WIDER STRIKES. 
</P>

 Western warplanes launched a limited attack on a Serbian nationalist air base 
and on missile and antiaircraft artillery sites in south-central Croatia on 
Monday, destroying the air defenses and making the runways and taxiways 
unusable, U.S. and allied officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attack, carried out by North Atlantic Treaty Organization warplanes in 
retaliation for this month's three sorties by Serbian rebels near the Bosnian 
city of Bihac, marked the most extensive strike that the alliance has launched 
in its 1 1/2-year effort to protect U.N.-sanctioned "safe areas" in 
Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 NATO aircraft -- including 30 combat planes, two-thirds of which were 
American F-16Cs, F-15Es and F/A-18Ds -- took part in the attack, launched at 
11:30 a.m. (2:30 a.m. PST) from five separate NATO bases in Italy. Officials 
said that all the aircraft returned to their bases undamaged. 
</P>
<P>
 Pentagon officials said that the strikes knocked out one Serbian-controlled 
SA-6 surface-to-air missile battery and some antiaircraft artillery pieces and 
left five large craters in the airfield runway, blocking the use of the 
accompanying taxiways as well. 
</P>
<P>
 As in previous NATO air strikes, the raid was carefully limited to minimize 
the risk that it would spur either Serbian nationalists or Croats to widen the 
war. U.S. military experts said that the airfield could be repaired easily. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, allied officials said, the strike succeeded in "sending a 
message" that the United Nations and NATO allies "will not tolerate the use of 
bases in Croatia for military operations in Bosnia." 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton, in a session with reporters, called the NATO strike "a 
strong and entirely appropriate response." 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll just have to see how events develop," he said. "But I strongly support 
the NATO action." 
</P>
<P>
 And Secretary of State Warren Christopher warned that if Serbian nationalists 
do not stop using their warplanes to bomb Bihac, NATO fighters "will not 
hesitate" to return with orders to do substantially more damage than they did 
Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 It was not immediately clear what impact Monday's raid would have on the 
Bosnian Serbs. Bosnian government reports said that ground fighting in the 
Bihac area was continuing, but it seemed likely that the Serbian-controlled 
bombing would be interrupted at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Adm. Leighton W. Smith, commander of the NATO operation, said that the 
allied air armada scored "good hits" in the area. But he added: "It's fairly 
easy to fill up a hole in an airfield, so I don't expect this . . . to be out 
of commission for an awfully long time." 
</P>
<P>
 The raid was the first under a new U.N.-NATO get-tough policy that extended 
the "no-fly" zone previously maintained only over Bosnia and authorized NATO 
warplanes to strike at multiple targets, rather than using "pinprick" raids 
against a single tank. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's action came after Bosnian Serb forces, backed by renegade Muslim 
troops, attacked Bosnian government soldiers throughout northwestern Bosnia 
early Monday, defying a U.N. threat to launch the NATO air strikes if the Serbs 
did not stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbian-controlled warplanes had used the Udbina airfield as a base for 
launching air strikes on Bihac, an enclave held by the renegade Muslims until 
its capture in August by Bosnian government forces. 
</P>
<P>
 On Saturday, the U.N. Security Council voted to allow NATO to expand the 
"no-fly" zone, which has prohibited Bosnian Serb warplanes from flying over the 
country. Under the embargo, any Serbian plane caught violating the restrictions 
is subject to being shot down. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the warnings by U.S. and NATO officials, policy-makers here 
stressed that the allies were acting gingerly to avoid any spread of the ground 
fighting into Croatia. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both the Bosnian government and the Croatian government understand that we do 
not intend to support any action by them that would widen the war, and we made 
that point strongly to both Zagreb and Sarajevo," a U.S. official said later. 
</P>
<P>
 The official also denied that the raid marked the beginning of any new allied 
effort to push the Serbs to the peace table by using military force. "We 
continue to believe that the war should end by (adoption of the peace) 
agreement (brokered by the United Nations)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Military officials said that Monday's raid lasted an hour and 45 minutes. 
Following standard procedures, allied warplanes first swept in to knock out 
Serbian nationalist air-defense positions, paving the way for bombing runs. The 
Serbs fired a missile at the planes but apparently missed. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said that the NATO aircraft used laser-guided bombs to create 
craters at the intersections of five key runways and taxiways, rendering the 
airfield temporarily useless, and fired cluster bombs and Maverick missiles at 
the air-defense facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 But planners said they intentionally did not destroy the 15 to 20 Serbian 
nationalist fighter planes that were parked on a nearby apron, even though it 
is precisely this kind of aircraft that the Serbs have been using to bombard 
Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a military proposition, they clearly could have been struck," one U.S. 
official said. But he said the raid was sufficient to send the desired message 
and said that strategists wanted to limit the possible danger to people. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials also took pains to point out that the decision to limit the 
scope of the mission was made jointly by U.N. and NATO strategists. They said 
it was "clear" that Smith had "agreed with the judgment . . . that this was the 
appropriate level." 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration has been criticized by members of Congress for allowing the 
United Nations to control too much of the decision-making for such missions. 
Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole (R-Kan.) said Monday that it seems as though 
NATO is becoming subordinate to the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the U.S. F-16Cs, F-15Es and F/A-18Ds, the attack force included 
British Jaguar fighters, French Mirage 2000s and Dutch NF-16Cs. About 10 or 12 
support aircraft, including airborne warning and control system planes, also 
took part. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Sarajevo, heavy gunfire broke out again late Monday near the 
Holiday Inn, the temporary headquarters of the U.S. Embassy. U.S. Ambassador 
Victor Jackovic took refuge for a short time in the hotel's basement garage. 
</P>
<P>
 Wire services reported that Serbian-fired "Sagger" guided missiles hit the 
roof of the Bosnian presidency building and near the city government building 
next door, injuring three people. Sniper fire halted the city's tram service. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bosnian Serbs also shelled government-held Tuzla and several other areas 
of northern and northwestern Bosnia. Bombing Raid 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 NATO aircraft participated in bombing Serbian targets in Croatia and 
Bosnia-Herzegovina early Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 MAIN TARGET: 
</P>
<P>
 1) Udbina: NATO warplanes bomb an airfield in Serbian-held Croatia used as 
staging point for recent air raids on Bihac. 
</P>
<P>
 SERBIAN REACTION: 
</P>
<P>
 2) Northwestern Bosnia: Serbian forces, backed by renegade Muslim fighters, 
attack government troops. 
</P>
<P>
 3) Sarajevo: Sniper fire intensifies as two missiles strike Bosnian government 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 4) Tuzia: Bosnian Serb forces conduct hourly shelling of Tuzla in retaliation 
for bombings.

CLINTON, RABIN SEE URGENCY IN PALESTINIAN AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NORMAN KEMPSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a clearly concerned Israeli prime minister at his side, President Clinton 
promised Monday to press the world community to pay up quickly on commitments 
of aid to the beleaguered Palestinian self-rule authority in hopes of quelling 
the violence in the strife-torn Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Clinton did not offer to add to the $100 million the United States 
has already given to the Palestinians this year, he told Israeli Prime Minister 
Yitzhak Rabin that he will urge other donors to deliver about $125 million in 
pledges before the end of the year in an effort to quiet the unrest that 
spawned a deadly confrontation Friday between Gaza demonstrators and the 
fledgling Palestinian police force. 
</P>
<P>
 In a dramatic reversal of roles, Rabin came to Washington to appeal for funds 
for the Palestine Liberation Organization-run government, which faces a severe 
test of power with Islamic militants of the Hamas and Islamic Jihad movements. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Clinton and Rabin sought to prepare U.S. public opinion and 
the incoming Republican-controlled Congress for an Israel-Syria peace agreement 
that might depend on U.S. troops to monitor the strategic Golan Heights. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton also agreed in principle to continue U.S. financial support for 
Israel's Arrow tactical missile-defense system, and he promised to ship two 
sophisticated supercomputers to the Israeli Defense Ministry. The President 
pledged to maintain the overall level of U.S. aid to Israel at $3 billion a 
year, the highest of any country receiving American aid. Republicans have 
called for cuts in foreign aid, but most have indicated that they would not 
reduce the Israeli allocation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Arrow project is nearing the end of the research and development phase. 
U.S. officials said that the extent of U.S. financial support must be 
negotiated between the Pentagon and the Israeli Defense Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials said that the meeting covered all elements of the U.S. 
relationship with Israel, much attention was focused on the recent rioting in 
the Gaza Strip and the new Palestinian Authority's pressing need for cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you bring peace to a place, you need to work hard to make sure that the 
benefits of peace become apparent to people who are the targets of the enemies 
of peace," Clinton said. "And the poor in Gaza are clearly the targets of the 
enemies of peace. So we have to work harder and more aggressively . . . to try 
to make the benefits more apparent." 
</P>
<P>
 In the heady days after Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat signed a peace 
agreement on the White House Lawn in September, 1993, dozens of wealthy nations 
and international financial institutions pledged almost $2 billion over five 
years to help pay the cost of Palestinian self-government. For this year, total 
pledges were about $700 million, of which at least $500 million still has not 
been delivered. 
</P>
<P>
 A senior Administration official declined to name the countries that have 
failed to keep their promises but said they include nations in the Persian Gulf 
region, Europe and East Asia. The United States plans to prod the donor 
countries when they meet in Brussels next week. Although Washington will urge 
the donors to make good on the entire $500 million in outstanding pledges, 
Clinton's vow to "try to move about $125 million out in a hurry" indicates that 
the Administration's goal is actually more modest. 
</P>
<P>
 The official said that the PLO must shoulder some of the blame for the slow 
pace of aid because Arafat and his supporters failed for months to establish 
adequate accounting provisions to assure the donors that their money will be 
properly spent. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was the first between Clinton and Rabin since the Republican sweep 
in the Nov. 8 elections. They pledged to maintain all of the elements of the 
current U.S.-Israeli relationship and sought to persuade Congress to let them 
do it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure that without the United States' involvement, support under the 
leadership of both President Clinton through Secretary (of State Warren) 
Christopher, it would be much more difficult . . . to achieve this progress in 
the peace process that we all witnessed," Rabin said in reference to Israel's 
agreement with the PLO and its peace treaty with Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Clinton said, "I have reaffirmed my support for the current aid 
level to Israel, as well as for certain security assistance, including the 
Arrow missile program, in the years ahead so that we can continue to support 
the security conditions that in my judgment are the precondition for Israel 
being able to make a just peace with all their neighbors in the Middle East." 
</P>
<P>
 But both men were clearly haunted by the specter of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), 
the incoming chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, who denounced 
the Israel-Syria peace talks as a "fraud," and of other Republican leaders who 
have expressed opposition to stationing U.S. troops in the Golan Heights to 
monitor an Israel-Syria peace. 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli officials have said that only the presence of U.S. monitors in the 
Golan would give the Israeli government the confidence needed to agree to 
return the strategic plateau to Syria as part of a peace settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton maintained that no U.S. troop commitment has been requested. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin sought to reassure U.S. public opinion by recalling that American troops 
have monitored the Israel-Egypt peace in the Sinai Peninsula for 15 1/2 years 
and that other international troops have been stationed along the Golan for 19 
years without ever coming under attack.

GRAMM URGES GOP TO BE BOLD IN SPENDING CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MELISSA HEALY and EDWIN CHEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Senate firebrand and GOP presidential contender Phil Gramm chastised fellow 
Republicans on Monday for being too timid in efforts to shrink the government 
and called on Congress to make huge reductions in social programs to pay for 
new tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview with The Times, the Texas Republican said that the new 
GOP-dominated Congress will create an unnecessary and potentially damaging 
controversy if it tries to use creative accounting to finance tax cuts for 
investors and middle-class families. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he urged fellow Republicans to adopt a budget that simultaneously 
cuts taxes and slashes discretionary spending, a category that includes 
education aid, public health and highway construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are many Republicans who want the blessings of limited government but 
who are unwilling to vote for limited government to make those blessings 
possible," Gramm said. "And I think we're coming to the moment of truth." 
</P>
<P>
 Later in the interview, Gramm complained that, when it comes to deficit 
reduction, "there's been a constant gap between (Republican) rhetoric and the 
reality of our actions. Now is the time we're going to have to stand and be 
counted." 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm's proposal could open a Pandora's box on Capitol Hill because it runs 
headlong into budget rules that prevent Congress from paring domestic programs 
to offset tax cuts that otherwise would widen the deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 Those "pay as you go" rules, adopted during the George Bush Administration, 
were initially supported by many GOP lawmakers because they prevented Democrats 
from financing expanded social programs by raising taxes. Now, with Republicans 
about to take charge of both houses for the first time in 40 years, the rules 
are a potential obstacle to GOP tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm's comments are the opening salvo in the looming congressional 
budget-balancing wars. In a wide-ranging interview in his Senate office, Gramm 
reflected not only sharp divisions between Senate Republicans and Democrats but 
potentially deep rifts among congressional Republicans themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Those splits are certain to become more pronounced as GOP lawmakers like 
Gramm, preoccupied largely with deficit reduction, struggle to dominate the 
congressional agenda against Republicans intent on increasing defense spending, 
pressing divisive social policies, such as school prayer and abortion 
restrictions, and instituting accounting practices known as "dynamic scoring," 
which are grounded in supply-side economics. 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got a lot of people who have been in the minority for many years and 
who have got these pent-up little agenda items," Gramm said. "And I think what 
we're going to have to do is have the leadership to say to them: 'We're going 
to be in power for many years to come. Let's stay with our agenda now.' " 
</P>
<P>
 He proposed that Republicans avoid becoming embroiled in a debate over 
"dynamic scoring," which assumes that tax cuts will spur economic growth and 
increase, rather than decrease, federal revenues. Democrats, including 
President Clinton, have charged that the technique is a budgetary trick that 
allows Republicans to claim they are cutting the deficit when they are driving 
it up. 
</P>
<P>
 If Republicans insist on justifying their tax-cut proposals with "dynamic 
scoring," said Gramm, "the media is going to clearly accuse us of trying to 
keep phony books and trying to defy Milton Friedman's law on free lunches" -- 
which argues that there are none. 
</P>
<P>
 The solution is to accept the budget calculations favored by Democrats "but 
with the proviso that if we are right and they are wrong, that the additional 
resources go to deficit reduction and to additional tax cuts," Gramm said. "Now 
why would you object to that? Only if you don't have the courage to control 
spending." 
</P>
<P>
 Under Gramm's plan, Congress would pay up-front for a family tax cut by 
cutting funds from the departments of Education, Housing and Urban Development 
and Health and Human Resources. To offset a capital gains tax cut, Gramm called 
for cuts in what he called "corporate subsidies," including subsidized interest 
rates and direct loans from the Small Business Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Only when the tax cuts start creating wealth and bringing in new revenue -- as 
Gramm and fellow Republicans are confident they will -- should Republicans take 
credit for them, Gramm said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we can do it," Gramm said. "I think if we can do it, we're going to 
have to do it now, while the public is ready for dramatic change. This is not 
the time for incremental thinking. This is a time to be bold." 
</P>
<P>
 As Gramm laid out his challenge to Republicans, White House officials 
scrambled on another issue Monday as they tried to gain the support of Gramm's 
likely rival for the GOP presidential nomination, Senate Minority Leader Bob 
Dole of Kansas, on a crucial trade vote coming before Congress next week. 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials indicated that they were able to close some gaps with 
Dole over the vote on a new world trading regime that will succeed the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. And they expressed optimism that they could 
announce agreement with him today. The trade pact would sharply reduce tariffs, 
or taxes charged on imports, and limit other barriers to increased world trade. 
</P>
<P>
 Dole, who generally favors efforts to remove barriers to international trade, 
said Sunday that he would be more likely to support the controversial revision 
of the world trade regulations if the White House endorses a reduction in the 
capital gains tax. His position in the Senate leadership -- he likely will be 
majority leader in the new Congress -- has given him a crucial voice in the 
trade debate, and it is unlikely that Clinton could win approval of the trade 
plan if Dole fights it. 
</P>
<P>
 In other comments Monday, Gramm told The Times that he would: 
</P>
<P>
 * Like Congress to apply any cuts in defense spending specifically to deficit 
reduction. 
</P>
<P>
 * Support giving the President the line-item veto but said that he doubts 
Clinton's sincerity in seeking such authority. "Forgive me for being a little 
cynical, but when we were trying to do it in the last two years, we never heard 
a peep out of the President." 
</P>
<P>
 * Work to enact health care legislation that includes medical malpractice tort 
reform and changes in the insurance market to ensure that coverage is 
renewable. 
</P>
<P>
 * Vote to make Dole majority leader, even though the Kansas senator is likely 
to be one of Gramm's chief GOP presidential rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 * Back Sen. Trent Lott (R-Miss.) for Senate Republican whip over incumbent 
Alan K. Simpson of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
 Gramm also expressed skepticism for the depth of Democratic support for a 
balanced-budget amendment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's one thing for the Democrats to vote for it when they think it's not 
going to pass. I think you're going to see a lot of people who have voted for 
it in the past who are going to vote no."

USDA TRIES TO SERVE UP FOOD STAMPS TO THE HUNGRY; POVERTY: MILLIONS HAVE BEEN 
SPENT TO MAKE THE PROGRAM ACCESSIBLE. CRITICS SAY IT ENCOURAGES WELFARE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONIA NAZARIO, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bucking the anti-welfare movement, the U.S. Department of Agriculture is 
bankrolling a crusade to attract people to food stamps -- the most broadly used 
federal anti-hunger effort, already serving one in nine Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort is a striking turnaround for the USDA, which has issued grants 
totaling more than $2.5 million to 27 groups since last year in an attempt to 
make food stamps, the largest of 14 federal hunger programs, more accessible. 
Such federal outreach funding was banned throughout much of the 1980s, as 
government shunned the notion that taxpayers should pay to promote welfare 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The new policy means taxpayers are now underwriting the efforts of anti-hunger 
advocates such as Cynthia Lottie. Twice a week, Lottie and others from the 
nonprofit Southern California Interfaith Hunger Coalition scour welfare 
offices, hoping to ease the way for many among the millions who are eligible 
for food stamps but not receiving them. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent morning, Lottie passes throngs of security guards and a metal 
detector as she enters the Los Angeles County Department of Public Social 
Services office Downtown. Every chair inside is taken, and people line the 
walls. The air reeks of sweat. Social workers in 12 plexiglass booths address 
people through microphones. Lottie announces: "Anyone have a problem with their 
case?" 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes! Right here!" exclaims Milton Oppenheimer, madly waving his arms in the 
air. Oppenheimer, 35, is beleaguered. This is his second trip to the office to 
apply for food stamps in the past week. On this day, he arrived at 7 a.m. After 
he repeatedly asked why he hasn't been put on food stamps, the homeless man 
says, his social worker shut off her two-way microphone and shoved his 
application aside, asking him to move along. A security guard who has been out 
of work for two months, Oppenheimer says he is despondent. "I'm in limbo. I 
think they put my papers in the circular file." 
</P>
<P>
 Lottie offers to help the Marine Corps veteran. Oppenheimer cheers her on. 
"Sure! Go in there! Kick some tail!" He adds: "Once you get hungry you get 
desperate. Then, you take care of No. 1. . . . This is America. C'mon. I'm a 
veteran, for God's sake." 
</P>
<P>
 Lottie files a complaint, then prods the social worker to put Oppenheimer on 
food stamps, arguing that he is clearly eligible. An hour later, Oppenheimer's 
name blares over the loudspeaker as he is called to be fingerprinted and issued 
a food stamp identification card. Oppenheimer says he can now spend his time 
looking for another job as a security guard or in a factory rather than 
standing in soup kitchen lines. 
</P>
<P>
 As a homeless man, Oppenheimer is part of one group the federal government is 
trying to reach through its new efforts to promote hunger assistance programs. 
Others are the elderly and the working poor -- people who often don't know 
about food stamps, falsely believe they are not eligible, are stymied by the 
bureaucracy or avoid applying out of shame, sometimes going hungry instead, 
USDA officials say. The policy shift -- which probably will be reviewed by the 
new Republican majority in Congress -- also reflects a recognition of research 
that shows the ranks of hungry Americans have burgeoned to up to 30 million, 
many of them children. 
</P>
<P>
 In Los Angeles, $200,000 in federal money now funds seven public service 
television ads -- airing in English and Spanish since August -- that urge 
people to look into food stamps. "Food stamps can help you in tough times," the 
announcer intones, flashing the Interfaith Hunger Coalition hot line number. A 
San Francisco grant helps five city outreach workers promote food stamps in 
senior citizen centers and subsidized child-care centers. And in New York City, 
the Community Food Resource Center Inc. scours unemployment, utility and 
telephone offices to sign people up. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon, the USDA will announce a $5-million, two-year national nutrition 
education blitz by the agency. The aim is not only to inform children about the 
benefits of good eating, but to use the agency's first coast-to-coast 
billboard, television, radio and print ad campaign to highlight the nation's 
anti-hunger programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Some oppose the agency's new outreach attempts. "The government should be 
discouraging people from getting on welfare. We used to tell people we wanted 
them to be self-sufficient," says Robert Rector, senior welfare policy analyst 
at the Heritage Foundation, a conservative think tank. The federal government 
will spend $40.2 billion in fiscal 1995 for 14 anti-hunger programs, including 
food stamps and school lunches, roughly 60% of the Agriculture Department's 
budget. "What we are doing is generating a huge population of dependent people 
who work less, marry less and rely on the government more," Rector said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in Congress are moving in the opposite direction of the Agriculture 
Department, determined to cap spending on food stamps and other welfare 
entitlement programs whose budgets until now have expanded to meet the 
burgeoning numbers of eligible applicants. Almost 69% of those eligible 
received food stamps in 1992, the most recent figure available -- up from 
nearly 56% in 1989. One welfare reform bill -- which estimates that the total 
welfare tab will swell from $328 billion to $500 billion by 1998 -- requires 
that the growth rate in these programs be held to 3.5% each year. 
</P>
<P>
 But USDA officials and many food policy experts point out that two-thirds of 
the elderly who are eligible for food stamps and more than half of the working 
poor go without. Some opt instead for church-sponsored food pantries, but 
these, facing more clients and fewer food donations, are overwhelmed, forcing 
them to limit their assistance and turn away many requests for help. "There are 
many needy people who aren't participating," said James Ohls, a senior fellow 
at Mathematica Policy Research Inc., which conducts government studies on food 
stamps. 
</P>
<P>
 Contrary to widespread perceptions of dependency, most food stamp recipients 
use the program for less than seven months. More than a third, however, again 
sign up for food stamps within a year of leaving the program. "A lot of this is 
people moving in and out of jobs," said University of Wisconsin professor and 
welfare expert Maurice MacDonald, who contends that food stamps therefore are 
doing exactly what society wants: preventing hunger. Recent studies, MacDonald 
said, have measured the disincentive to work generated by food stamps and found 
the effect is minor. 
</P>
<P>
 "These programs exist to serve all who are eligible and hungry. If we aren't 
reaching them, we should," said USDA Undersecretary Ellen Haas, who intends to 
continue outreach funding. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's new efforts are unlikely to curb what many see as the main 
factor driving hunger: the growing number of people falling into poverty. 
Although outreach, increased government assistance and an expanding economy 
drastically reduced the ranks of the hungry in the 1970s, their numbers soared 
by 50% between 1985 and 1991, according to Tufts University reports, as global 
economic shifts brought a loss of manufacturing jobs and erosion of income. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is more with our poverty policy than our hunger policy. It is our 
continuing failure to address poverty," said Peter Eisinger, director of the La 
Follette Institute of Public Affairs, Public Policy and Administration Program 
at the University of Wisconsin. Contrary to earlier spurts of economic growth, 
expansion of the economy in the 1980s and 1990s pulled more people -- now 
almost one in six -- into poverty, as a growing number were left to compete for 
low-paying service jobs. Earnings for the average man without a high school 
degree plummeted to an inflation-adjusted $14,439 in 1989 from $22,858 in 1967. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounting divorce rates and out-of-wedlock births have left more parents to 
raise and feed children on one salary. Spending on public housing declined, 
forcing nearly half of low-income families to spend 70% of their earnings on 
housing, and less on food. Those who seek out government assistance such as Aid 
to Families with Dependent Children have seen benefits for a family of three 
plummet 47% since 1970, when adjusted for inflation. "The government must 
create incentives to keep jobs in the U.S." and discourage their flight to 
lower-wage countries, said Marc Cohen, senior research associate with the 
nonprofit advocacy group Bread for the World. "The problem isn't really with 
the (anti-hunger) programs. It is with the lack of high priority for a full 
employment economy." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, in California, only half of those eligible for food stamps receive 
them. Focus groups conducted this summer by the nonprofit California Food 
Policy Advocates found that many falsely believe a person must be homeless or 
unemployed to qualify for food stamps; many elderly say that despite hunger, 
they cannot ask for a government handout. Others say that because food stamp 
benefits are adjusted according to a person's income, small benefits for some 
are outweighed by application waits that can last days in dangerous and dirty 
welfare offices. 
</P>
<P>
 Welfare offices often close their doors early -- 2 p.m. in Los Angeles. Anyone 
with a car valued at more than $4,550 is disqualified. Food stamp recipients 
must file monthly reports and reapply every six months, even if their incomes 
do not change. Those who want to apply for various federal anti-hunger programs 
must deal with up to four separate agencies that manage the programs in 
California, according to the Government Accounting Office, Congress' 
investigative arm. "We need to simplify procedures," Haas said. "Today, many 
people sit in food stamp offices all day." 
</P>
<P>
 Participation problems affect other USDA anti-hunger programs, where nearly 
two-thirds of recipients, according to the GAO, are children. Most children who 
are eligible for a free or reduced-price breakfast at school don't get it 
because their districts don't participate in the program. Fewer than 17% of 
children getting free or reduced-price lunches at school last year received 
summer meals because of the lack of sponsors, according to the Food Research 
and Action Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohls, the government's food stamp researcher at Mathematica, noted that those 
receiving food stamps typically get enough coupons to last three weeks, leaving 
them hungry the last week of the month. The average benefit, 74 cents per meal, 
is only about half of what the USDA calculates is needed for a nutritionally 
balanced diet. Benefits are low because the Agriculture Department's formula 
unrealistically assumes that even applicants with very low incomes can set 
aside 30% for food, Ohls said. Another assumption -- that people who often lack 
cars can shop at low-priced supermarkets absent from many inner cities -- is 
equally unrealistic, said David Super, general counsel for the Center on Budget 
and Policy Priorities, a liberal research group. "Clearly," Ohls said, "people 
who are on food stamps are hungry. It is not satisfying all their food needs." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the USDA's highest priorities now is to substitute a plastic credit card 
for traditional paper food stamp coupons. The recipient's benefit amount 
becomes a kind of credit limit; purchases are deducted at the cash register. 
The process, which operates in six areas of the country, is meant to be less 
vulnerable to fraud and also reduce the stigma for food stamp users. 
California's program is scheduled to begin in San Bernardino and San Diego 
counties in 1995, followed by Los Angeles the next year. 
</P>
<P>
 While the government moves to modernize its food stamp program, people like 
Sondra Trudeau are at the front lines in welfare offices, helping the public 
sign up. 
</P>
<P>
 Trudeau, an Interfaith Hunger Coalition trainee, encounters people struggling 
with the 10-page food stamp application -- shorter than those in other states, 
which run up to 40 pages long. Sometimes tempers flare. "If I see you on the 
street, I'll kill you. I'll kill you," one woman says, gesturing angrily in a 
social worker's direction as security guards guide her toward the door of the 
South-Central office. 
</P>
<P>
 A 58-year-old woman with bad eyesight who can't read or write approaches 
Trudeau, who has helped three others get food stamps today. Her food stamps 
stopped eight months ago -- she's not sure why, but she wants to get them 
again. This is her seventh trip to the office, says the former garment worker, 
who is looking for work as a nanny or cleaning lady because she can no longer 
see well enough to sew. "No one will help me," she laments, explaining that she 
has spent five hours in the office today alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two hours later, Trudeau has worked with the woman's social worker to 
gain her $115 in food stamps and $212 in general relief. Deeply moved, the 
woman, explaining that she is very hungry, quietly says to Trudeau, "Thank God. 
Thank you." About This Series

</P>
<P>
 The food stamp program is the government's single largest effort to fight 
hunger, providing people whose net income is at or below the poverty level with 
coupons that can be used to purchase food in grocery stores. About one in nine 
Americans -- and nearly half a million households in Los Angeles County -- 
receive food stamps. The program, which has bipartisan support, was first 
developed during the Depression. Food stamps can be used to buy most food, but 
not alcohol or cigarettes.

Services -- the local welfare agency -- handles applications (although 
applicants do not have to be receiving welfare).

HOUSING, RELIGIOUS RIGHTS CLASH IN RENTAL DISPUTE; LAWS: STATE HIGH COURT TO 
REVIEW CHICO LANDLADY'S REFUSAL TO RENT TO COUPLE BECAUSE THEY WERE UNMARRIED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAURA DOLAN, TIMES LEGAL AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Gail Randall and Ken Phillips fell in love with the Chico duplex. It had pale 
yellow clapboards trimmed in brick, a high, steep roof, hardwood floors and a 
fireplace. The tree-shaded home reminded Randall of a gingerbread house. 
</P>
<P>
 But there was a hitch. The landlady, a conservative, devout Christian, refused 
to rent to unmarried couples. When she learned Randall and Phillips lived 
together outside of marriage, she canceled the rental agreement and mailed back 
their deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was real disappointing," said Randall, 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple filed a complaint against the landlady, sparking a constitutional 
dilemma over the competing rights of religious freedom and fair housing, 
property and privacy, and, peripherally, over what constitutes sin. 
</P>
<P>
 Backed by onetime presidential candidate and television evangelist Pat 
Robertson, the landlady maintains that her religious convictions entitle her to 
discriminate. She and a handful of other landlords around the nation have been 
prevailing in courts with the help of a legal aid group started by the 
conservative preacher. 
</P>
<P>
 California Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren, the state's top law enforcement officer, 
recently refused to continue representing a state fair housing agency against 
the Chico woman. Lungren said he supported a Court of Appeal ruling in her 
favor, forcing the state agency to obtain a private lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Supreme Court agreed to review the dispute even though it had 
failed to reach a decision in a similar Southern California case. The justices, 
who rarely drop a case after voting to accept it, were believed to have been 
deeply torn. Now the case is considered the most important constitutional test 
on the issue because most other state high courts have avoided ruling directly 
on the religious freedom issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it means the homosexuals and the fornicators can't find a place to live," 
said Evelyn Smith, 62, the Chico landlady, "well, I am sure there are enough 
sinners who would rent to them. I am not saying people should be homeless." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, expected next year, could have widespread ramifications, allowing 
the deeply religious to discriminate against gays and heterosexual couples in 
housing, employment and other business transactions. 
</P>
<P>
 About 500,000 unmarried couples live together in the state, and the majority 
of people who married in Los Angeles County in 1993 lived together previously. 
</P>
<P>
 Discrimination on the basis of marital status is barred by California's Fair 
Employment and Housing Act, which also prohibits discrimination by race, color, 
religion, sex, national origin, ancestry, disability and familial status. 
Landlords who rent rooms in their homes are exempt. 
</P>
<P>
 About 11% of the housing complaints lodged in California in 1992-93 alleged 
discrimination because of marital status. The bulk of the grievances came from 
renters who believed they were denied housing because of race or because they 
had children. 
</P>
<P>
 Chico, nestled near the Sierra Nevada foothills north of Sacramento, is an 
eclectic community best known as the home of Chico State, which Playboy 
magazine once christened the top party college in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 But the predominantly white, middle-income town also shares the conservatism 
of the rest of Butte County. Farmers tend almond and walnut orchards, and 
retirees from elsewhere in the state are attracted by Chico's mild winters, its 
two well-regarded hospitals and a relatively low cost of living. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who raised her family in Chico, lives in a different neighborhood from 
her rental units. The widow said most prospective tenants go away quietly if 
they do not like her rules on "hanky-panky." 
</P>
<P>
 She once explained her feelings to a gay man who wanted to rent from her. "He 
said, 'I respect you for that,' " and decided not to pursue the vacancy, she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Randall and Phillips were indignant. He was 28 at the time, she 24. They 
had lived together for about three years after meeting in her hometown of 
Atascadero in San Luis Obispo County. She went to school and worked with 
Phillips in his landscaping business. 
</P>
<P>
 When Phillips called Smith about the vacancy seven years ago, she told him she 
preferred to rent to married couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "That shouldn't be a problem," Phillips, now 35, remembered replying at the 
time, and now says, "which it shouldn't be. It was a bit of spin control on my 
part." 
</P>
<P>
 Before meeting Smith later that day, the Chico landscaper called the 
California Department of Fair Employment and Housing and was told that such 
discrimination was illegal. 
</P>
<P>
 But the couple continued their pretense when they met Smith at the duplex, in 
a neighborhood where the couple had long wanted to live. She accepted a 
deposit, and the couple signed a rental agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Randall nor Phillips wanted to continue the charade. Phillips called 
Smith later that day and told her the truth. She put their deposit in the mail 
and canceled the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Randall, an aspiring nurse who goes to school at night and works two jobs, 
said she was "tired of the issue coming up." 
</P>
<P>
 She and her boyfriend had previously rented from a landlord who assumed they 
were married, and rather than risk losing their home, let him believe as he 
wished. She did not like the subterfuge. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't like being put in the position of having to lie," she said, "and we 
certainly did not want to keep up the lie every month." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith remembers the couple as "absolutely thoughtless, careless young people." 
</P>
<P>
 The mother of three grown children, Smith rents out two duplexes to supplement 
the pension of her late husband, a mail carrier. She wears a crucifix around 
her neck, has a Christian bumper sticker on her car and marches in an 
anti-abortion rally once a year. 
</P>
<P>
 After the unmarried couple filed a complaint against Smith with the state 
housing commission, her friends put her on "the prayer chain," so that many 
people would be asking God to send her an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan Lorence, who was representing a conservative Christian group at the 
time, took the case. He now is being paid by Pat Robertson's Virginia-based 
American Center for Law and Justice, which has represented landlords in similar 
cases. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing of the California Fair Employment and Housing Commission, a 
representative of Smith's church, the Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.), testified 
that she would not be committing a sin if she rented to an unmarried couple. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith is still riled about that. "This man can't tell me how I am going to get 
to heaven," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 A representative of the Orthodox Presbyterian Church testified that the Bible 
supported her views. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ruled for the tenants and ordered Smith to pay them $900 and to post 
a notice on her units that she had unlawfully discriminated. The commission 
later reduced the fine to $454. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no way in the world I am ever going to rent to fornicators," Smith 
said, and appealed the decision. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Court of Appeal, ruling in her favor, cited "the state's 
interest in promoting the marriage relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 Courts in Minnesota and Illinois also have sided with landlords, but unlike 
California, those states have laws that prohibit fornication. They cited those 
laws in their rulings. 
</P>
<P>
 A Wisconsin court held that unmarried couples did not fall under a local 
ordinance prohibiting discrimination on the basis of marital status. 
</P>
<P>
 Massachusetts' highest court told the state it had to show compelling reasons 
for forcing a landlord to rent to someone in violation of his religious 
beliefs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bucking this trend, the Alaska Supreme Court ruled in favor of the tenants in 
a dispute with a religious landlord. The U.S. Supreme Court on Oct. 31 declined 
to review the case, leaving Smith's as the pivotal test of the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith's lawyer noted that unmarried couples are treated differently from 
married couples under the law. State colleges, he said, are exempt from the 
anti-discrimination regulation and can reserve housing for a single sex or for 
married couples. 
</P>
<P>
 "So the state is prosecuting Mrs. Smith for what the state is doing" in public 
colleges, Lorence complained. 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond college, some men share lodgings with women without being romantically 
involved. Lorence confessed that he did not know how religious landlords would 
treat such couples, but he added the situation probably was rare. 
</P>
<P>
 Marian Johnston, a private attorney who has been representing the state 
commission since Lungren withdrew, said people who do business in California 
must comply with the state's regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "If she doesn't like the way the state tells her to run her business," 
Johnston said, "she shouldn't be in the business." 
</P>
<P>
 A victory for Smith would allow landlords and employers to use religion as an 
excuse to discriminate in all kinds of ways, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am sure there are religious groups that don't believe in interracial 
couples," she said. "I would hate to think the state is required to accept 
discrimination against an interracial couple in the name of freedom of 
religion." 
</P>
<P>
 Gays would be particularly affected by the court's ruling, said Los Angeles 
lawyer Thomas F. Coleman, who is representing Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some employers may not want to employ homosexuals," he said. "It is against 
the law, but they can use this theory that it is a sin in their mind." 
</P>
<P>
 Smith said she told her husband on his deathbed eight years ago that she would 
try to join him in heaven. She fears she might not get there if she rents to 
sinners. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not saying everybody who rents to fornicators is not going to go to 
heaven," she said. "But my God won't let me do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Randall and Phillips no longer live together, but remain friends. Like Smith, 
they plan to attend the California Supreme Court's oral arguments in the case, 
which have not yet been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips said the episode with Smith upset him because he felt she was 
intruding into the privacy of his sex life. But he did not think of the 
rejection as discrimination until many months later, when he saw a television 
program about landlords who refused to rent to African Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 "Being a white male, I don't think of these things that often," he said. 
"Usually I am not the victim of them -- usually."

KEMP, BENNETT WARN OF GOP RIFT ON PROP. 187; POLITICS: THEY URGE WILSON, OTHERS 
TO TONE DOWN DEBATE. THE REMARKS SUGGEST PITFALLS AWAITING NEW MAJORITY PARTY.

<P>
 Presaging what may evolve into an internecine battle over immigration in the 
upcoming GOP-dominated Congress, two prominent Republicans Monday warned that 
carrying the Proposition 187 banner on the national stage could prove divisive 
and shift party thinking sharply to the right. 
</P>
<P>
 William J. Bennett and Jack Kemp, former cabinet secretaries with presidential 
aspirations, continued their attacks on Gov. Pete Wilson for his promotion of 
Proposition 187 as a national remedy for the problems of illegal immigration 
that wrack California and a few other states. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying they fear that emotions over the issue will swamp sound policy 
decisions, Bennett and Kemp sought to tone down the anti-illegal immigrant 
rhetoric from Wilson and others as threatening to the Republican Party's 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's scapegoating, damn it, and he should stop doing it," Bennett said of 
Wilson. "The problem with (Proposition) 187 as a solution . . . is it is 
meretricious. It is superficially attractive. But it doesn't solve the 
problem." 
</P>
<P>
 "Where the battleground will be fought is if they want to carry this 
nationally and turn the party away from its historic belief in opportunity and 
jobs and growth, and turn the party inward to a protectionist and isolationist 
and more xenophobic party," Kemp said. "That would be something around which 
the soul of our party would be decided." 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, both Republicans counseled taking a longer view. "We 
are willing to concede that tossing logs onto the anti-immigration fire might 
result in short-term gains. But believe that in the medium and long term, this 
posture is a loser." 
</P>
<P>
 Bennett and Kemp surprised many Republicans by opposing the ballot initiative 
shortly before the Nov. 8 election, while endorsing Wilson's reelection. Wilson 
criticized them for butting into California affairs and blurring the 
distinction between legal and illegal immigrants. But rather than burying the 
hatchet, the three Republicans appear to be locked in a running shootout. 
</P>
<P>
 The rift among top Republicans reflects not only the importance that 
immigration has attained in the wake of the Proposition 187 victory. It also 
suggests the pitfalls that the new majority party in Congress may encounter 
while wrestling with the visceral issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Existing Republican immigration proposals do not advocate barring illegal 
immigrant children from school, as Proposition 187 would. But if the measure's 
backers succeed in winning sufficient lawmakers to their point of view, the 
debate over immigration legislation could become sharply factional. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an issue of tension that they're aware of and will do everything they 
can to avoid," said Kent Weaver of the Brookings Institution, a Washington 
think tank. "It will pit the fiscal conservative, pro-cheap labor forces versus 
those who want to appeal to Hispanic voters." 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.), who is in line to chair the House judiciary 
subcommittee on immigration, said, "The success of 187 will push the issue (of 
immigration reform) . . . and will guarantee that Congress will take it up. I 
hope that the legislation has bipartisan support." 
</P>
<P>
 Facing the new complexities that now underlie congressional discussions about 
immigration, Smith would not reveal his position on denying schooling to 
illegal immigrant children, the most controversial aspect of the California 
ballot initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp and Bennett made their remarks at a news conference co-sponsored by the 
Manhattan Institute and Empower America, two conservative Washington think 
tanks that issued a group of "leading immigration indicators," a compendium of 
various demographic statistics on legal immigrants. The two former cabinet 
officials and other speakers said they worried that the momentum generated by 
Proposition 187 would carry over to punitive measures toward legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "This report puts the facts on the table," said Bennett, a former secretary of 
education. "Just like health care, there is no crisis in legal immigration." 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, Bennett said, the problem lies in blending the new arrivals into 
American society. "It's a problem about American society right now, and that is 
assimilation. So, if you will, it's not legal immigration, stupid, it's 
assimilation, stupid," Bennett said, modifying the Democrats' 1992 campaign 
credo. 
</P>
<P>
 Joined by several speakers, including Ron Unz, who challenged Wilson for the 
Republican gubernatorial nomination, Bennett and others praised the net 
benefits of legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we are to improve things, we should look less to adjusting the flow of 
legal immigrants and much more to things like affirmative action and reverse 
discrimination, bilingual education, multiculturalism in the classroom and the 
like," Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, reacting in a television interview at Williamsburg, Va., where he is 
attending the Republican Governors Conference, said, "We really don't need any 
lectures from anyone from outside of California on the vast contributions of 
legal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Kemp and Bennett) continue to confuse legal and illegal immigration. They 
are missing the point that was not missed by all the legal immigrants who voted 
for 187." 
</P>
<P>
 Kemp and Bennett advocate a stronger Border Patrol presence, accelerated 
deportation process, crackdown on counterfeit documents and reform of the 
Immigration and Naturalization Service to combat illegal immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Robert Shogan in Williamsburg contributed to this story.

GUN-TOTING BACKERS BOOST ARAFAT WITH MASSIVE RALLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY CURTIUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a massive show of force, an estimated 10,000 supporters of PLO leader 
Yasser Arafat marched in Gaza City on Monday, firing their guns in the air and 
chanting slogans against the Islamic opposition just days after Arafat's 
security forces and Islamic militants engaged in bloody street battles. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here is the weapon, here are the Fatah Hawks, at the hands of our leader, 
Yasser Arafat, ready to heed your call," roared thousands of young men armed 
with automatic weapons. "Whoever wrongs Fatah, Fatah will open his head." 
</P>
<P>
 Fatah is the largest faction of the Palestine Liberation Organization and was 
founded in the 1960s by Arafat, chairman of the PLO and head of the Palestinian 
self-governing authority. 
</P>
<P>
 The march marked a change of tactics for Arafat from the conciliatory stance 
he took after his police force opened fire on Islamic demonstrators Friday, 
killing 14. The two sides quickly agreed to a truce, but efforts to extend that 
to a broader political accord between Arafat and Islamic militants stalled 
Monday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 Fatah's march seemed calculated to show the Islamic organizations that 
Arafat's faction remains the strongest in Gaza. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one can compete with Fatah and with the PLO or with the Palestinian police 
and the Palestinian security forces," Arafat told the cheering crowd, speaking 
from the same spot where he first addressed Palestinians after his return to 
Gaza in July after decades in exile. 
</P>
<P>
 After negotiations with the Islamic militants began to falter Sunday night, 
Arafat requested the rally, according to Palestinian sources. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, the Voice of Palestine, the Palestinian Authority's official radio 
station, broadcast blunt warnings to the Islamic opposition groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Describing Fatah as the mother of all Palestinians, Voice of Palestine warned 
that any child who disobeys his Fatah mother will face severe punishment. At 
first, an unidentified commentator said, the child will be grabbed by the ear. 
If he continues to disobey, "the ear will be cut. Maybe later, also hands and 
legs will be cut, and also throats will be cut. The message of the mother of 
the children is clear and open and harsh and tough." 
</P>
<P>
 The radio station also appealed to Fatah activists to attend the pro-Arafat 
march and to bring their guns with them. Many of the militants who responded by 
the busload to Arafat's call were leaders of the Palestinian uprising, or 
intifada, that erupted in Gaza and the West Bank in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 They had been largely pushed aside when Arafat and other PLO officials arrived 
in Gaza from Tunis, Tunisia, to take over the self-governing authority in July. 
But Arafat turned to them Monday as his strongest base of support in the 
territories. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today is a referendum of the national authority, a referendum of the PLO," 
Arafat told the crowd. "The state of alert continues, and eyes are open. You 
are the protectors of security; no one can take away from Fatah and the 
Palestinian police," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours before the march began, leaders of Hamas and Islamic Jihad told 
reporters that they would not sign an accord with Arafat brokered by a group of 
Israeli Arab leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat must accept personal responsibility for what happened Friday. That is 
our No. 1 condition. Until that condition is met, we will not sign anything," 
said Ahmed Bahar, a Hamas leader in Gaza. The Palestinian Authority had offered 
to set up a judicial commission of inquiry into Friday's occurrences but balked 
at accepting blame for what the opposition calls the "massacre." 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, an estimated 200 armed Palestinian police, wearing helmets and 
carrying riot shields, surrounded the Palestine Mosque in downtown Gaza City, 
where about 6,000 worshipers -- many of them supporters of Hamas and Islamic 
Jihad -- had gathered for noon prayers. Accounts differ over who started the 
confrontation that ensued, but a riot erupted as prayers ended. Police fired at 
rock-throwing demonstrators, and the clash soon spread into surrounding 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the first clash between Palestinian police and civilians since Israel 
handed day-to-day control of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank town of Jericho 
to the PLO in May. Before the fighting ended Friday night, about 13 people had 
been shot dead and at least 129 wounded. A 14th victim, Ata Kanan, died of his 
wounds Monday and was buried. About 200 supporters of Islamic organizations 
attended his funeral. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's bloodshed sent shock waves through the Palestinian community and 
raised the specter of civil war erupting in Gaza. Mediation efforts were 
launched immediately, and all sides initially called for calm. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Islamic opposition parties listed stiff political demands they said 
Arafat must fulfill as their price for reconciliation. They refused to disarm 
or to moderate their violent opposition to the PLO's accord with Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 Some leaders of the more militant Islamic Jihad and the Izzidin al-Qassam 
faction of Hamas have even threatened to begin attacking Palestinian police and 
Palestinian officials unless Arafat agrees to dismiss, try and execute senior 
police officers and dismiss Justice Minister Freih abu Medeen. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was a Fatah rally with a clear message," Hisham Abdel Razik, a Fatah 
leader in Gaza, said in an interview on Israeli television Monday night. "The 
message is that Fatah is the one who carried the struggle for 30 years. It is 
Fatah who brought about the success of the political process. It is Fatah who 
brought about the first step on the road to Jerusalem."

NO LONGER CAPITOL DOORMATS, REPUBLICANS REVEL IN PERKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FAYE FIORE and REBECCA TROUNSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was just the morning after, the ballot boxes were still sizzling with the 
voter rage that had booted the Democrats from the House majority for the first 
time in four decades and already, stepping off the elevator, he could feel the 
difference. 
</P>
<P>
 This staffer who had toiled on the Hill for 20 years as a member of the 
Republican Party -- "the minority party" -- was suddenly commanding some 
respect. He had gone to bed Rodney Dangerfield and gotten up Sylvester 
Stallone. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people who run the elevators in the Capitol -- they are pretty surly 
generally -- but all of a sudden they are very solicitous," said the aide to an 
Orange County congressman. "I am getting calls from people I've never heard of, 
inviting me to lunches and dinners I never knew were going on." 
</P>
<P>
 In the 40 years that they have controlled the House, the Democrats have 
decided what bills came to the floor, what was debated and who debated it in 
the process that shapes this nation's laws. They have also controlled the 
quality of daily life in Washington for thousands of Republicans. And, if you 
ask the GOP, 40 years is a long time to be treated like a doormat. 
</P>
<P>
 But all of that is about to change. On that fateful Nov. 8, voters swung the 
prison door open. This beaten minority is poised to seize the wheel and there 
is an electricity in the Washington air as GOP lawmakers jockey to lead 
committees and subcommittees where they have long been hushed, slashing 
Democratic staff they always considered bloated. And, on the eve of power, some 
Republicans admit to having a little trouble overlooking past slights. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember Democrats telling us we couldn't use more than six pieces of paper 
to copy something," bemoaned Brad Smith, a veteran Washington staffer who now 
works for Rep. David Dreier (R-San Dimas). "I don't think people realize how 
petty things got." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans were banished to the tiniest offices, where their phones hardly 
ever rang. Nobody cared what they had to say. Republican members of the 
Committee on House Administration, which decides who gets to park where at the 
Capitol, say they don't know where anybody parks -- the Democrats wouldn't tell 
them. (It is rumored that one committee had 27 underground parking spaces for 
Democratic staffers and just one for the Republicans.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We get little glimpses now and then, and that's only because we kick and 
scream," one of the committee's Republican staffers said. "Frankly, I welcome 
their opportunity to feel what it's like." 
</P>
<P>
 It is in such committees that the real work of Congress gets done, and the 
Democrats nearly always wildly outnumber Republicans. "The Democrats have five 
lawyers and three or four other staff assistants," said Andrew Cowin, 
Republican staff counsel for the subcommittee on crime and criminal justice. "I 
have me and Audray (the secretary), and I share her with another lawyer." 
</P>
<P>
 The theory is this: Make the little tasks difficult and the big ones become 
impossible. One Republican likened it to showing up for work every day bound 
and gagged and then taking heat for never getting anything done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes, it's almost been like you were a member of a jury where only half 
the members even came to hear the evidence and then the jury foreman reaches 
into his pocket and pulls out the rest of the votes," said Rep. Edward R. Royce 
(R-Fullerton). "It's been awful." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, however, as they combine committees and cut staffs, Republicans say they 
will hang on to the proportional advantage the majority party has always 
enjoyed. After all, said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach), "we now 
feel totally justified in keeping that same formula." 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, should Rohrabacher ascend, as he hopes, to the chairmanship of a 
subcommittee on space, he said, "I will have a significant number of staff 
working for me, and (the subcommittee's Democrats) will have basically one 
working for them." 
</P>
<P>
 The Republicans will also gain another kind of leverage. By controlling the 
appointments of those who head the Congressional Budget Office and the General 
Accounting Office, they will now have access to the reams of documents 
generated by those agencies, of invaluable help in researching legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 "When Democrats gave speeches on the floor of the House, they were often 
incredibly researched and written because they were able to use their own 
staffs, the committee staffs and the staffs of those offices," Rohrabacher 
said. "Our guys had to do much of the research themselves." 
</P>
<P>
 Gone are the days of never getting bills passed, never getting to offer 
amendments. No more teeth-grinding as some freshman Democrat presides over 
sessions of the House while even the most venerable Republican can't so much as 
sit in the Speaker's chair. 
</P>
<P>
 A square dance of sorts is about to take place as occupants of tiny, 
inconvenient offices move into the nicer digs so the Democrats can hoof it for 
awhile. Once empty phone-mail boxes are filling up. Republican lobbyists who 
couldn't get a job a year ago are suddenly in demand. And long-frustrated GOP 
veterans are awash in euphoria. This is their day in the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am still waking up every morning thinking it's a dream," said Rep. Robert 
K. Dornan (R-Garden Grove), who used to sit in the Speaker's chair when the 
House was dark just to see what it felt like. So thrilled is he about this 
shift of power that Dornan will not necessarily honor his vow to make his ninth 
term his last. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is just a spirit of joy right now," Rohrabacher said. "Even during the 
early days of the Reagan Administration, it wasn't like this. Now we're 
veterans. We know exactly what we want to do and what leverage we've got, and 
we're very anxious to get going." 
</P>
<P>
 Some wonder now how the Republicans ever let this humiliation at the hands of 
Democrats happen in the first place. The oppression set in slowly, like aging, 
the process unnoticeable but the result unmistakable. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you throw a frog in boiling water, he jumps out. But if you put him in 
warm water and slowly bring it to a boil, he lets himself cook," said Rep. 
Christopher Cox (R-Newport Beach). 
</P>
<P>
 A lot of Republicans keep saying they have no vengeance in their hearts, that 
they will not stoop to treating their oppressors as they were mistreated. Or at 
least they hope not. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have cried for the opportunity to go to the plate and take a swing for so 
long," said Rep. Elton Gallegly (R-Simi Valley). "I hope and pray . . . that 
we'll get up there and take our best swing rather than fight along the 
sidelines or try to stick it in the other guy's ear." 
</P>
<P>
 After all, Gallegly said, the greatest vindication he can imagine is for 
Republicans to move cherished elements of their long-stalled agenda out of the 
forgotten crannies of the committee system, onto the floors of the House and 
Senate and up for votes. 
</P>
<P>
 They also promise, magnanimously, to open the rules, allowing more debate, 
more amendments to be offered, and probably, longer days for many on the Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that we have so much work to do that the feeling of wanting any 
kind of retribution is really the last thing on our minds," added Dreier, the 
San Dimas congressman and one of the architects of the congressional 
restructuring now under way. "We plan to be much more fair." 
</P>
<P>
 Then again, revenge is sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect there are some people who have been down so long and kicked around 
so long that they may have vengeance in their hearts," one aide said. "It may 
be pay-back time." Inside Washington

COLUMN ONE; ECOLOGICAL RUSSIAN ROULETTE; WHILE MOSCOW BATTLES ECONOMIC CHAOS, 
ENVIRONMENTAL WOES RAVAGE THE PROVINCES. PUBLIC HEALTH IS IN JEOPARDY, 
ESPECIALLY IN TOWNS SUCH AS NADVOITSY, WHERE CHILDREN PAY A GRIM PRICE FOR 
POLLUTION. 
</P>

<P>
 The children of this town learn early not to smile. 
</P>
<P>
 When they do, they show a ghastly array of blackened, splintered, rotting 
stumps where milk-white teeth might have been. 
</P>
<P>
 An environmental plague has struck this northern land of lakes, no longer 
pristine, and thinning pine forests. The children of Nadvoitsy are its victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Their disease is caused by a pollutant that the town's main employer, the 
Nadvoitsy Aluminum factory, dumped in its back yard for three decades. Slowly, 
the contaminant seeped more than a mile through the watery soil to the lake 
that supplies drinking water to almost all of the 19,000 residents of this 
little town near the Finnish border. 
</P>
<P>
 In one of the many cruel ironies bred by environmental indifference in the 
former Soviet Union, the substance that has sickened an estimated 4,000 
children in Nadvoitsy is massive quantities of fluoride. Because it is 
beneficial in small doses, no one ever bothered to check for its presence. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, for years after officials discovered the chemical culprit in the 
mid-1980s, townspeople continued to drink from the poisoned lake. Building a 
pipeline to a cleaner water source was deemed too expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Dreadful as Nadvoitsy's story is, its water woes are hardly unique. A new 
report from the Environment Ministry says half of Russia's population is forced 
to rely on substandard drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadvoitsy's polluters, chastened by the rage and sorrow of the townspeople, 
are at last committed to cleaning up -- just when Russia's economic tailspin 
makes it nearly impossible to raise the money to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 As this one-factory town and hundreds of other dangerously polluted Russian 
cities have discovered, environmental safety has become a casualty of the 
country's economic chaos. 
</P>
<P>
 Forty-three Russian cities are in urgent need of air pollution relief, 1,016 
plant and animal species are endangered, and deforestation is widespread, the 
World Bank reported recently. 
</P>
<P>
 Virtually nothing has been done to clean up the radioactive and toxic waste 
sites that pepper the country. And as a symbol of the environmental calamities 
here, even the most basic of human needs -- clean drinking water -- has been 
put on hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexei V. Yablokov, the father of Russia's environmental movement, recently 
warned that the dreadful ecological legacy of the former Soviet Union has only 
been worsened by five years of economic decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Between 14% and 15% of Russian territory is so polluted that it is unsafe for 
habitation, but 40 million people live there anyway, Yablokov said. 
</P>
<P>
 It is not surprising that environmental problems are low on the agenda for a 
new Russian leadership that has been consumed by the simultaneous struggle to 
calm violent political strife at home, squelch ethnic fires near its borders, 
carry out fundamental economic reform and cope with a huge decline in the gross 
national product. 
</P>
<P>
 But while Moscow's mind is elsewhere, ecologists say, Russia's far-flung 
provinces are being ravaged by uncontrolled strip-mining, clear-cutting of 
forests and surreptitious dumping of hazardous wastes. 
</P>
<P>
 "The term ecocide is very appropriate," Yablokov said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Russian authorities do catch environmental despoilers red-handed, they 
can mete out only puny punishment. Inflation has reduced to a pittance the 
maximum fines that polluters can be forced to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, in 1993, Nadvoitsy Aluminum spewed out 8,640 tons of pollutants, 
including airborne fluoride. But it has paid just $3,500 in fines this quarter 
for exceeding pollution limits, said Valentin P. Kudryavtsev, the senior 
environmental inspector who has been tenaciously prodding the aluminum plant 
and its neighbors to clean up. 
</P>
<P>
 The government recently decided against raising the fines to keep up with 
inflation, saying to do so would create undue economic hardship, Kudryavtsev 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some eco-offenders remain as brazen as ever. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, a chemical plant in Khabarovsk dumped 1 1/2 tons of furfural, an oily 
liquid used to make disinfectants and preservatives, into the Khor River. Local 
officials said the toxin caused $45 million in environmental damage. The plant 
will be fined and ordered to clean up the river, but none of the managers 
responsible for the dumping was sacked. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years after the Chernobyl nuclear accident demonstrated the folly of 
trying to cover up or ignore environmental catastrophe, Russian officials still 
have a tendency to do just that. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive Siberian oil spill that came to light last month began in August, 
but most Russians learned of it only after Americans blew the whistle. In fact, 
such oil and chemical spills are so common that they barely make news here. 
Nevertheless, they have steadily contaminated the nation's water supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 As rivers in the former Soviet Union were befouled, planners began tapping 
underground aquifers for drinking water. Now, pollutants have seeped into these 
underground sources, especially in the intensely industrial European part of 
Russia, according to the Environment Ministry report. It found the quality of 
80 aquifers that supply 60 cities with drinking water had worsened in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In the cities, aging water treatment plants are inadequately maintained, and 
authorities simply add more and more chlorine to dull the rising bacteria 
count. In the spring, Moscow's tap water smells like a public swimming pool. 
Elsewhere, it often runs orange or brown. 
</P>
<P>
 Where there is industrial equipment to control water pollution, it is often 
obsolete and overburdened. The ministry found the percentage of industrial 
waste water that is treated at all declined in 1993, to 8.7% of the total 
outflow. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 20% of the drinking water samples the ministry studied in 1993 
flunked biological or chemical purity tests, and 4.3% of samples contained such 
high bacterial counts as to pose "real epidemiological danger." Overall, the 
report concluded that Russia's drinking water problem is now critical and "has 
a dangerous tendency to deteriorate." 
</P>
<P>
 In 1993, Russia spent about $19.25 per citizen on environmental protection, 
forestry, national park maintenance and wildlife protection. Of that, $2.28 was 
used for capital investments to protect water resources. Overall environmental 
spending has shrunk 20% since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Russians never know whether their water is safe to drink because 
authorities do not test for many of the most dangerous pollutants, said 
Alexander Knorre, who heads the Moscow office of Greenpeace. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, very few Russian laboratories have the sophisticated equipment 
needed to test for dioxin, a chemical used in paper production that is a proven 
carcinogen, Knorre said. The test can cost up to $300, so it is almost never 
performed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upstream from Nadvoitsy is the huge Segezha paper plant, which almost surely 
emits dioxin. "If they can't measure it, it's not a problem," Knorre said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's economic calamity has somewhat slowed the pace of new pollution. A 
25% slump in industrial production over the last eight months alone has meant 
fewer toxic gases spewing from factory smokestacks and fewer poisons flowing 
into rivers and streams. 
</P>
<P>
 The slump caused Russia's 13 largest aluminum plants to release 13% fewer tons 
of air pollutants in 1993 than one year earlier. And biologists say the Volga 
River has become healthier since many of the huge chemical plants along its 
banks have shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 But these gains are illusory, ecologists warn. Fewer herbicides and pesticides 
are flowing into Russian waters only because cash-strapped farms cannot afford 
to buy them. When the economy improves, they say, factories will resume their 
lethal output. 
</P>
<P>
 The reckless disregard of the Siberian oil company Komineft, which continued 
to pump for two months while thousands of gallons of oil leaked into the watery 
tundra, shows that the Soviet-era priority for increasing industrial production 
at all costs has changed little, environmentalists say. Nature is still seen as 
inexhaustible and indestructible. Human health and safety have a relatively low 
value. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, Nadvoitsy officials brushed off warnings that the town water was 
not fit to drink, according to Kudryavtsev, an ecologist who was kicked out of 
one Communist Party meeting for insisting that a 24-mile pipeline must be built 
to provide the town with safe water. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our country is great at cosmonauts and weapons," the ecologist said bitterly. 
"The leadership didn't give a damn what kind of water we drank. You don't 
understand how this could happen, but I tell you, it's very simple: They just 
didn't care." 
</P>
<P>
 Officials also ignored the first cases of tooth disease, which began to appear 
in the 1970s as fluoride replaced the calcium in growing children's teeth and 
bones. Deprived of calcium, victims do not develop tooth enamel, and their 
teeth darken and rot, doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aluminum plant workers have very high rates of occupational illnesses, but 
adults who lived in the town were seemingly unaffected by the fluoride. It was 
not until the early 1980s, when more than three-quarters of the town's children 
were suffering at least some symptoms of environmental disease, that officials 
began looking for a chemical culprit. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let God himself judge them," said Yevgenia Misharina, a 16-year-old high 
school student who suffers from fluorosis. She has high cheekbones, wide-set 
blue eyes and an intoxicating grin. So many Nadvoitsy residents have bad teeth 
that nobody recoils at her smile. But in front of strangers, she tries to keep 
her lips closed over the wreckage inside. 
</P>
<P>
 Yevgenia and her friends say their joints often crack and ache in the morning, 
and they wonder what will happen to them as they age. They do not trust 
authorities who say their water is now safe to drink. They just want to grow up 
and move out of town as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want my kids to have brown teeth and bad bones and be in and out of 
the hospital all the time," said Anna Sidorova, 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides teeth and bone problems, Nadvoitsy's children also suffer from 
unusually high rates of liver and kidney disease, chronic hepatitis and 
respiratory ailments, including pneumonia, said Tatyana V. Tarasyuk, chief 
physician at Nadvoitsy hospital. Tarasyuk suspects some of these ailments may 
be exacerbated, if not caused, by the high levels of environmental pollution. 
</P>
<P>
 Tarasyuk's son also suffers from fluorosis. "It's not a pretty sight when he 
laughs," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nadvoitsy Aluminum officials have tried to make amends for the tragedy they 
admit they caused. At its own expense, the factory has dug up hundreds of yards 
of contaminated soil and sealed it in huge watertight pits to prevent more 
toxins from flowing into the lake. Gradually, the level of fluoride in the 
drinking water has returned to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 Using profits from aluminum exports, the factory also distributes free juice 
and vitamins to all the town's children. It has built a modern dentist's office 
with equipment from Germany and will cap the damaged teeth of any Nadvoitsy 
resident without charge. It is only a cosmetic fix -- some teeth have crumbled 
so much that caps won't hold -- but one that has earned the factory tremendous 
goodwill. 
</P>
<P>
 The factory has also hired Houston-based Kaiser Aluminum to replace a small 
fraction of its 1954 vintage equipment with more efficient, less-polluting 
technology. 
</P>
<P>
 At its Tacoma, Wash., plant, Kaiser uses a dry-scrubbing system that recycles 
airborne fluoride and other pollutants right back into the production process 
and is offering the same technology to Nadvoitsy and other Russian aluminum 
plants, said Kaiser's site manager, Richard Cable. But with inflation driving 
up Russian interest rates to 170% per year, the Nadvoitsy factory can little 
afford to borrow the huge sums needed to undo its toxic legacy. 
</P>
<P>
 "People understand that we are thinking of their welfare," said Anatoly V. 
Bezrukov, the factory's new director. "Maybe we can't do everything all at 
once, but we're trying. They understand." 
</P>
<P>
 Ecologist Kudryavtsev said it is too soon to applaud. The factory's airborne 
emissions are still so corrosive that plant windowpanes turn cloudy within a 
year of installation. Not a single pine tree grows within half a mile of its 
smokestacks, only anemic willows and low-lying shrubs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the fluoride," Kudryavtsev explained. "It kills the pine needles." 
</P>
<P>
 And the toxic fallout continues. Last year, public health authorities told 
Nadvoitsy residents to stop eating green vegetables from their gardens after 
they discovered unacceptably high levels of fluoride in locally grown lettuce, 
parsley and dill. 
</P>
<P>
 Even today, more than a decade after the fluoride link was conclusively 
proven, 5% to 10% of kindergartners show symptoms of fluorosis, Tarasyuk said. 
</P>
<P>
 The townspeople continue to drink from the same lake. Nadvoitsy officials 
insist that the water is now safe, but Kaiser Aluminum did its own analysis and 
instructed its staff not to drink it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the nearby Segezha paper plant has polluted many alternative water 
sources, there are local springs within driving distance where residents can 
draw clean water. But few bother. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the Russian character is a tendency not to take responsibility for his own 
health," Kudryavtsev said. "You can tell him it's better not to drink the 
water, better to boil it, but people will continue to drink it from the tap, as 
they always did. People think, 'I'll live as long as I live. It's in God's 
hands.' " 
</P>
<P>
 This attitude is reinforced by an unfortunate but widespread folk belief that 
any kind of pollution -- even radioactivity and heavy metals -- is washed out 
of the body by a good belt of vodka. 
</P>
<P>
 Briefly, in the late 1980s, an angry and powerful grass-roots ecology movement 
sprang up in Nadvoitsy, as happened across Russia in the aftermath of 
Chernobyl. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, the founder of Nadvoitsy's green coalition has moved away in search of 
better medical care for her ailing child, and the ecology movement has all but 
died out. 
</P>
<P>
 Townspeople say they are grateful that the aluminum factory is still 
operating, offers high wages in exchange for the dangerous work and pays 
salaries on time. 
</P>
<P>
 "The factory is the only institution that helps us," Tarasyuk said. "If there 
is no factory, there is no town."

SUIT CHALLENGES ACCOUNTING ON POLITICAL FUNDS; FINANCES: TRIAL OPENS IN CASE 
KEPT FROM PUBLIC VIEW SINCE 1990. ACCOUNTANT SAYS NEWPORT BEACH CONSULTANTS 
VIOLATED POLITICAL REFORM ACT THROUGH ANTI-TAX GROUP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Newport Beach political consultants used an anti-tax group they helped 
start to dodge a required public accounting of approximately $19 million 
donated by Californians to political action committees and causes, an attorney 
contended Monday during opening statements in a lawsuit mysteriously kept from 
public view since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the California Tax Reduction Movement became in practice is a most 
prolific goose who laid golden eggs," said Gary Phillips, the attorney for a 
Sherman Oaks man suing the consultants. "This (lawsuit) is about 
accountability." 
</P>
<P>
 On the opening day of a non-jury trial, Orange County Superior Court Judge 
Donald E. Smallwood asked attorneys in the case if they knew how and why more 
than 42 thick volumes of pleadings and other documents taken in the politically 
sensitive suit had been sealed from the public for more than four years. None 
of the attorneys professed to know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly I don't understand why we've got anything under seal in this case," 
said Smallwood, at least the fifth judge to preside over the case, which pits a 
shy, 45-year-old Sherman Oaks accountant against powerful direct mail gurus 
William Butcher and Arnold Forde. 
</P>
<P>
 Smallwood said it seemed "incongruous" to have a case under seal that was 
based entirely on alleged violations of the Political Reform Act of 1974. The 
law is "designed to illuminate" political fund-raising and other issues for the 
public, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he declined to unseal the six filing cabinet drawers filled with 
documents already filed in connection with the suit, Smallwood said that all 
1,300 exhibits and the testimony to be offered during the scheduled five-week 
trial would be public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that transpires in this courtroom is going to be open to the 
public," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, attorneys from both sides laid the groundwork for their cases. 
Phillips, representing accountant Paul McCauley, delivered an opening statement 
about the case. David Elson, an attorney for Butcher-Forde and their consulting 
firm, and Lawrence Straw, a lawyer for the tax reduction movement, now known as 
the Howard Jarvis Taxpayer Assn., offered comments on the case in written trial 
briefs presented to Smallwood. 
</P>
<P>
 At issue is whether the movement was a political action committee that should 
have been making regular public disclosure of where it got its money, and how 
it was spent. Also contested is whether Butcher-Forde Consulting or BFC Direct 
Marketing, as their firm is known, was the "de facto" tax reduction movement 
treasurer, and therefore financially liable for what McCauley maintains are 
violations of the Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
 If the tax reduction movement is determined to be a political action committee 
subject to the Political Refrom Act, and Butcher-Forde is found to be 
financially liable, the defendants could be ordered to pay fines equaling the 
money that was spent and that should have been accounted for publicly. 
</P>
<P>
 McCauley contends that Butcher-Forde used the tax reduction movement to set up 
various political action committees that traded on the well-respected Howard 
Jarvis name. According to court documents filed by the plaintiff, the 
committees would raise money through mass mailings and then transfer much of 
the proceeds back to the movement, which never publicly reported how the money 
was spent. 
</P>
<P>
 As their fees, Butcher and Forde arranged to be paid nearly half the money 
collected from Californians statewide to support such causes as the campaign to 
dump former Supreme Court Chief Justice Rose Elizabeth Bird, and another to 
Save Proposition 13, McCauley contends in court documents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of the money not reported would end up in one place: Butcher-Forde 
Consulting's pocket," Phillips charged in his opening statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Political Reform Act, the "receipts and expenditures in election 
campaigns should be fully and truthfully disclosed in order that the voters may 
be fully informed and improper practices may be inhibited." 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the courtroom, Elson did not deny that his clients made a lot of money 
under their contract with the California Tax Reform Movement. In fact, he said 
that large amounts of the group's expenditures "presumably got paid to 
Butcher-Forde Consulting." 
</P>
<P>
 According to federal income tax returns included in court documents, nearly 
half of the millions paid in two different years went to Butcher-Forde. 
</P>
<P>
 The records show that in 1985, half of the $6.9 million the group spent went 
to fund-raising, and another nearly $2.5 million was paid to Butcher-Forde as 
fees. In 1986, Butcher-Forde's fees totaled $1.8 million or 47% of the group's 
expenditures, court records state. 
</P>
<P>
 But, Elson stressed, the issue is not whether his clients got rich, but 
whether they had control of the California Tax Reform Movement's checkbook and, 
therefore, may be financially liable if the organization made reporting 
violations under the Political Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the plaintiff's overblown -- and, for that matter, legally irrelevant 
-- claims is that CTRM was formed and operated as no more than a mere 
instrument for the BFC defendants' . . . own profit," Elson argued in the brief 
he submitted in lieu of an opening oral statement.

CALTRANS LOSES SUIT OVER BAY POLLUTION; COURTS: JUDGE RULES THAT THE AGENCY 
VIOLATES CLEAN WATER LAWS BY ALLOWING ROADWAY RUNOFF TO DRAIN INTO THE OCEAN 
OFF SANTA MONICA. IT IS THE FIRST SUCH DECISION IN THE NATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLA CONE, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Admonishing the state transportation agency for halfhearted efforts at 
protecting the ocean, a federal judge has ruled that Caltrans is violating the 
nation's clean water law by failing to control pollution that flows into Santa 
Monica Bay from Los Angeles-area freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie decided Friday that he will issue an 
injunction in three weeks forcing Caltrans to take steps to prevent runoff from 
its 1,200 miles of highways, 50 or so maintenance yards and numerous 
construction sites in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, a major victory for environmentalists, could have national 
ramifications because it is the first time a public agency has been forced to 
tackle the formidable problem of urban runoff as required under the 1987 Clean 
Water Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Millions of gallons of oil and grease, toxic chemicals, debris and metallic 
wastes wash from freeways and streets into the county's vast network of storm 
drains every day, and the flow increases a thousandfold after storms, according 
to a UCLA study. The drains deposit the waste untreated into Santa Monica Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans -- believed to be the largest single source of bay contamination -- 
argued in court that it did not have the resources for pollution prevention and 
would have to use funds earmarked for critical needs such as freeway 
maintenance. Rafeedie rejected that argument, saying Congress designated clean 
water as a top national priority and Caltrans must comply. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a landmark decision," said senior attorney Gail Feuer of the Natural 
Resources Defense Council, an environmental group that filed the civil case in 
October, 1993. "Caltrans totally ignored the law and instead threw up their 
hands and said, 'We don't have the money.' Now they have to start taking storm 
water pollution seriously." 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans officials declined to comment Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge ruled that Caltrans failed to come up with a plan to prevent bay 
pollution or to train and supervise its employees at construction sites and 
maintenance yards. Criticizing the transportation agency for giving "lip 
service" to a state-issued water quality permit, Rafeedie ordered Caltrans to 
make pollution control a higher priority. 
</P>
<P>
 Rafeedie also warned Caltrans that he will impose fines if it does not comply, 
and, in an unusual move, approved the environmental group's request for an 
independent expert to monitor the agency's pollution control efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans and the Natural Resources Defense Council have until Dec. 5 to work 
out terms of an injunction outlining how and when the agency must comply. If 
they fail to agree, Rafeedie said he will decide the terms himself Dec. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the largest challenges facing Caltrans is to clean up high 
concentrations of lead, copper and oil-based pollutants that collect in catch 
basins along freeways. 
</P>
<P>
 After the suit was filed last year, Caltrans took some steps, including 
training its employees, but the judge called them "halfhearted efforts" to 
avoid liability in the case, the environmental attorneys said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our victory in this case means better protection for our coastal waters from 
the largest state transportation agency in the country," said National 
Resources Defense Council attorney Everett DeLano. The case was filed on behalf 
of the group and the Santa Monica Baykeeper, a citizens monitoring program. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Resources Defense Council recently settled similar suits against 
the cities of Beverly Hills, El Segundo and Hermosa Beach, and a case is 
pending against Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 Runoff is one of the largest and most intractable problems facing the bay 
because nearly everything that flows from yards, parking lots and streets in a 
400-square-mile area winds up in its waters, which are used by millions of 
swimmers, boaters, anglers and surfers. A new Santa Monica Bay Restoration Plan 
estimates that controlling runoff will cost $42 million -- two thirds of the 
total amount needed to clean up the troubled bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Clean Water Act, counties and cities were required to draft runoff 
management plans by 1991 and begin implementing them in 1992. Because of the 
scale of the task, violations are widespread nationally, according to U.S. 
Environmental Protection Agency officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The law requires local governments to use the "best available" methods, but 
Congress and the EPA did not set standards, so courts such as Rafeedie's are 
left to interpret it. Congress has been debating amendments to the act.

CENSUS FINDS MYSTERIOUS CHUMASH POPULATION BOOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRA E. STOLL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If the U.S. Census Bureau is to be believed, the tiny Chumash Indian tribe is 
experiencing a population boom, growing faster than almost any other group of 
people in the country, according to a report released this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1990 census counted 3,208 Chumash nationwide, up 120% from the 1,458 
reported in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report also said Chumash women have an average of only about 2.5 
children each. And unlike other rapidly growing racial and ethnic groups, the 
population of Native Americans does not increase because of immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, anthropology experts said, the mysterious population boom shown in 
the census reflects changing attitudes as much as changing populations. The 
problem is that some people who claim to be Chumash really are not, and some 
who claim not to be really are, said John Johnson, curator of anthropology at 
the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History. The Census Bureau has no way of 
knowing the difference. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all based on self-identification and sometimes it's imaginary," Johnson 
said. "I don't put much stock in it." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Thornton, a professor of anthropology at UCLA, said the jump in 
Chumash population seemed too high to be a natural increase. He, too, said it 
probably reflected a change in self-identification as much as a change in birth 
or death rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's kind of been fashionable since the '60s to be a member of an ethnic 
group," Thornton said. "Some people just want to jump on the bandwagon. Some 
people feel like they no longer have to be ashamed." 
</P>
<P>
 Thornton said the most glaring problem with the census was that it allowed 
people to identify themselves as members of only one racial group. Racial 
boundaries are becoming increasingly blurred as a result of intermarriage, he 
said, and the census figures do not reflect the reality of mixed families. 
</P>
<P>
 Census officials counted 408 Chumash in Los Angeles County and fewer than 400 
in Ventura County, although they could not provide an exact number. About 350 
Chumash live on a Santa Ynez reservation in Santa Barbara County. 
</P>
<P>
 Before European settlers arrived, the Chumash ranged across Ventura County and 
much of the central coast. Remnants of their villages are often uncovered at 
construction sites, and many developers, following state and local laws, employ 
Chumash monitors of Indian sites. Chumash-style art decorates Ventura City Hall 
and Thousand Oaks' new Civic Arts Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosa Pace, a spokeswoman for the Santa Ynez band, said she found the higher 
census count an encouraging sign of increased education and pride of heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past, there have been times that people were not putting down that 
they were Indian on the survey," Pace said. She said tribal representatives 
worked with census officials in 1990 to encourage Chumash to report themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 Nationally, despite a low rate of high school graduation, the Chumash are 
wealthier than most other tribes, according to statistics released Thursday in 
the 1,400-page Census Bureau report, "Characteristics of American Indians by 
Tribe and Language." 
</P>
<P>
 Of Chumash older than 25, 64.3% had high school diplomas or more advanced 
degrees. That falls below the U.S. figure of 75.2% and the Native American rate 
of 65.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The median family income for Chumash was $30,856, higher than the Native 
American median of $21,619 but lower than the $35,225 figure for the general 
population, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the education and income figures were useless because of the 
distortion that goes along with self-identification. 
</P>
<P>
 But another expert said the census report's information seemed reasonable to 
him. Paul Valenzuela Varela, executive director of the Oak Brook Park Chumash 
Interpretive Center, said most of the Chumash he knew were laborers who worked 
hard but quit school after eighth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our families didn't have much education at all," Varela said, adding that the 
trend seems to be changing with subsequent generations.

HANDS-ON LESSONS IN LOCAL HISTORY; EDUCATION: AT THE STAGECOACH INN MUSEUM, 
WIDE-EYED SCHOOLCHILDREN EXPERIENCE LIFE AS IT WAS IN 1894 IN THE CONEJO 
VALLEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There is a term often used when describing movies and books that can be 
appropriately applied to the Stagecoach Inn Museum -- suspension of disbelief. 
</P>
<P>
 It may be that the replica stagecoach has an axle that does not turn. After 
all, the closest it came to the true West was on a Hollywood set. 
</P>
<P>
 And it's true that when children crowd into a pioneer kitchen to bake 
biscuits, an electric toaster is hidden in the antique black-iron stove. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the inn itself. The real one burned down in April, 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 But every Wednesday, when wide-eyed children crowd into the historical museum, 
employees at the Stagecoach Inn will insist that the year is 1894, not 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The struggle to maintain historical accuracy is the key to this learning 
museum's success, says Carol Anderson, the museum director. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want people, and especially children, to see exactly what this area was 
like when people used to come through here on the stagecoach," Anderson said. 
"It's the best way to learn about the past." 
</P>
<P>
 And museum officials have done their best to recreate history. Downstream from 
the Stagecoach Inn, hidden from Ventu Park Road by a grove of sycamore trees, 
are a pioneer house, a Spanish soldier's adobe and a Chumash hut. 
</P>
<P>
 And just south of the inn is a three-quarter-size replica of Timber School, 
once the area's only one-room schoolhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 The Timber School was built by high school students over the past three years 
and was initially scheduled for completion last June. But the opening has been 
delayed until April because the students want the project to be perfect. 
</P>
<P>
 Midway through construction, a 78-year-old former Timber School student 
noticed that plans for the wood-framed building omitted a second entrance used 
to split boys from girls. 
</P>
<P>
 "They wanted everything to be just as it was," Anderson said. "Otherwise, 
there was no point in building it." 
</P>
<P>
 Once the floor is completed and the antique schoolroom furniture is moved in, 
Anderson said, schoolchildren will be able to learn what it was like to sit in 
class a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Until then, third-, fourth- and fifth-graders from across the Conejo Valley 
will continue a program established to recreate life from the days when the 
inn, called the Grand Union Hotel, was a stopover for stagecoaches traversing 
the hilly terrain between Los Angeles and Ventura. 
</P>
<P>
 Children pound acorns, carry firewood and make biscuits as the Chumash 
Indians, the Spanish and the pioneers did many years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first we just gave them a lecture and a tour," said Miriam Sprankling, the 
museum's historian. "But we wanted the children to have a hands-on experience. 
Now after three hours they really feel like they were a part of the past." 
</P>
<P>
 Area parents and museum enthusiasts said they have found the program 
invaluable. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's extremely important that children learn the history of how their 
community was formed," said Daryl Reynolds, president of the Conejo Valley 
Historical Society.

JAPAN ENACTS FINAL POLITICAL REFORM LAWS; ASIA: THE LEGISLATION CREATES 300 
SINGLE-SEAT PARLIAMENT DISTRICTS. CHANGES AIMED AT PRODUCING A TWO-PARTY 
SYSTEM, CUTTING CORRUPTION.

 Concluding a six-year struggle under seven prime ministers, Japan's Parliament 
on Monday voted into law the final pieces of political reforms designed to 
produce a two-party system, campaigns fought on policy issues rather than 
pork-barrel handouts and periodic changes of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Socialist Prime Minister Tomiichi Murayama, however, said the vote marked 
"just the start of political reform." 
</P>
<P>
 The form of "a saint has emerged but it has no soul yet. We must transform 
(the laws) into a force that will restore the people's confidence (in 
politics)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three bills drawing boundaries for 300 single-seat lower house districts, 
stiffening penalties for vote buying and fixing qualifications of parties 
eligible to share $309 million in government campaign subsidies passed the 
upper house in a nearly unanimous vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The subsidies, equal to $2.50 for each voter, will be given to parties for the 
first time in proportion to their holdings in Parliament, in the hope of 
reducing corruption stemming from reliance upon donations from special interest 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Coupled with reforms passed in March under former Prime Minister Morihiro 
Hosokawa, the new laws, which go into effect Dec. 25, will end a 70-year-old 
system of multi-seat districts with an average of four representatives, some of 
whom polled less than 20% of the total vote. Two hundred other seats will be 
filled through a proportional representation system, in which voters cast a 
second ballot for the party of their choice. 
</P>
<P>
 Spurred by a 1988-89 stocks-for-favors scandal that tainted all of the leaders 
of the then-ruling Liberal Democratic Party, efforts to carry out reform were 
thwarted repeatedly until an intraparty rebellion deprived Japan's perennial 
rulers of their 38-year grasp on power and brought a reform coalition under 
Hosokawa to power in August, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, rebels within the ranks of Hosokawa's supporters once again 
defeated reforms in an upper house vote in January. A last-minute compromise, 
however, won Liberal Democrat support and brought about enactment in March. 
Bills passed Monday filled in the details of those laws. 
</P>
<P>
 When the new electoral system will be put to a test remains unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Prime Minister Tsutomu Hata called for elections early next year, but 
Murayama said he was not thinking of dissolving the lower house, whose term 
runs through July, 1997. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new system, the next election is certain to create an upheaval. NHK, 
the semi-governmental radio and TV network, reported that politicians belonging 
to the Liberal Democrat, Socialist and Harbinger parties in Murayama's 
coalition already are battling each other in unofficial campaigning in 131 of 
the 300 new single-seat districts. Forty-eight of those battles pit Liberal 
Democrats against Liberal Democrats. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of eight parties that supported the former coalition governments of 
Hosokawa and Hata -- who have pledged to form a single unified opposition group 
Dec. 10 -- are doubled up against each other in 44 districts, NHK said. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result of the intense competition, major aims of the reforms -- to slash 
electioneering costs and to force one-on-one battles focusing on party policy 
-- appeared unlikely to be realized. 
</P>
<P>
 Commentators predicted that at least two or three elections would be needed to 
reduce the current field of more than a dozen parties to two major groups, each 
capable of running a government -- if indeed a weeding-out proves possible. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, 40 rebels in the ranks of Murayama's own Socialists have declared 
their intention to set themselves apart from the Liberal Democrats and the 
Hosokawa-Hata group -- both of which are conservative blocks -- by establishing 
a third "liberal force." 
</P>
<P>
 Such a rebellion would deprive the Murayama coalition of a majority in the 
lower house. A walkout of that scope, however, was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, Murayama abandoned more than four decades of Socialist pacifist 
ideology, declaring Japan's armed forces constitutional and supporting the 
U.S.-Japan Security Treaty. Since then, both the ruling coalition and the 
opposition have been struggling to find new policies with which to distinguish 
themselves in appealing to voters.

NEPAL COMMUNISTS' PARLIAMENT WIN SEEN AS REBUKE OF CENTRIST PARTY; ELECTIONS: 
INFIGHTING, CORRUPTION AND BROKEN PROMISES ARE BLAMED FOR DEFEAT IN HIMALAYAN 
KINGDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 To all those political scientists and gloating Cold Warriors who consigned the 
Communists to the ash heap of history, the Nepalese have delivered a resounding 
raspberry from atop the Himalayas. 
</P>
<P>
 The result could be a political creature that, until Monday, would have been 
no less improbable than the Yeti, or Abominable Snowman: a hereditary monarchy 
whose government is led or dominated by professed champions of the toiling 
masses. 
</P>
<P>
 In last week's elections for a new Parliament in one of the world's 10 poorest 
countries, the Communist Party of Nepal-United Marxist-Leninist (UML) has 
emerged as the No. 1 vote-getter, obtaining 86 seats against 80 for the 
centrist Nepali Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 "The election results have made it amply clear that the people are in favor of 
a change," said the leftist party, which along with Congress was in the 
forefront of the campaign for restoration of parliamentary democracy in this 
Hindu kingdom. 
</P>
<P>
 Caretaker Congress Prime Minister Girija Prasad Koirala conceded defeat. "The 
Nepal people have indicated that they want the Nepali Congress to play the role 
of a strong opposition in this country," he said in a statement broadcast by 
state radio and television. 
</P>
<P>
 The humbled 71-year-old politician was possibly more responsible than anyone 
for his party's lackluster showing at the polls. He had been prime minister 
since May, 1991, but bitter Congress infighting, the stench of official 
corruption and widespread disillusion over his government's unfulfilled 
promises sapped his popularity badly. 
</P>
<P>
 In that respect, the Nov. 15 verdict of Nepalese voters was more akin to the 
repudiation that their American counterparts gave President Clinton and other 
Democrats this month than an embracing of the ideals of Karl Marx and V.I. 
Lenin. 
</P>
<P>
 "UML people are not Communists in the conventional sense of the term," said 
Dev Raj Dahal, a political analyst at Tribhuvan University's Center for Nepal 
and Asian Studies in Katmandu. "UML's policies show it is a party of 
socialists." 
</P>
<P>
 Krishna Prasad Bhattarai, president of the Congress, agreed, saying: "Nepal's 
democracy is equally safe in their hands." 
</P>
<P>
 When a mutiny of rebel lawmakers inside his party deprived Koirala of a sure 
majority, he tendered his resignation July 10. King Birendra, an absolute ruler 
until the 1990 pro-democracy movement led him to renounce almost all power, 
asked him to stay on until new elections. 
</P>
<P>
 If Koirala was the loser, the final victor in the polling remained to be 
determined. By itself, the UML fell well short of the 103-seat majority needed 
to control outright the 205-seat House of Representatives, so it will have to 
seek coalition partners. 
</P>
<P>
 A small Maoist group, the Nepal Workers' and Peasants' Party, won four seats, 
while right-wing monarchists picked up 20. A party based in the Terai flatlands 
obtained three seats, and independents won six. Counting for the remaining half 
a dozen seats was not complete, further adding to the uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
 Newly elected UML lawmakers are to meet Wednesday to decide whom they will 
invite to help form a coalition government. The party statement said they would 
turn to those same "friendly forces" that took part in the 1990 struggle for 
the re-establishment of a multi-party system, in which more than 50 people 
died. 
</P>
<P>
 UML sources had ruled out overtures to the right-wing Rashtriya Prajatantra 
Party, which is mostly made up of people who served in the old system of 
appointed councils in which the royal palace conducted all affairs of state and 
parties were outlawed. However, UML general secretary Madhva Kumar Nepal 
pointedly said that in politics, there are "no permanent enemies, no permanent 
friends," and reportedly had begun informal consultations with the RPP, as well 
as the Maoists and anti-Koirala rebels in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 If may even be too early to count Koirala out. The caretaker prime minister 
told a news conference at his official residence Monday evening that he would 
not rule out the possibility of a "national government based on a national 
consensus" if that were necessary to protect Nepal's nascent democracy and 
eliminate the need for another election in the near future to replace a shaky 
coalition. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of serving in the interim government in 1990-91 that bridged the gap 
between the absolute monarchy and the election Koirala and his party won, the 
Communists have never held power in Nepal. In office, the UML has pledged to 
"encourage foreign investment," but Nepal, the party's general secretary, has 
added, "what we do not want is to allow alien capitalists to harm the interests 
of native industrialists and businessmen." 
</P>
<P>
 That is an oblique criticism of Indians, who were seen as winning numerous 
sweetheart deals with the backing of longtime friends in the Nepali Congress. 
Those transactions fueled feelings of Nepalese nationalism and resentment that 
gave the UML a definite boost at the polls.

HUMAN ERROR RULED OUT IN FERRY DISASTER AFTER BOW DOOR IS CHECKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The crew wasn't to blame for the Estonia ferry disaster, but metal fatigue or 
poor design might have been, investigators said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can forget the theory of human error," said Tuomo Karppinen, a Finnish 
member of the commission that is investigating the disaster."The crew had not 
left the bow door open." 
</P>
<P>
 More than 900 people died when water flooded the Estonian ferry's deck after 
the 56-ton door was torn off during a storm. Investigators had been unsure 
whether the door came off because it wasn't shut properly or because there had 
been a technical malfunction or design flaw. 
</P>
<P>
 Metal fatigue has not been ruled out, Karppinen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvagers raised the door from the Baltic seabed Friday, hoping for definitive 
evidence of why the ship sank Sept. 28 while traveling from Tallinn, Estonia, 
to Stockholm. Of the 1,049 people on board, only 136 survived. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very clear now that all the hydraulic locks on the door were closed at 
the time of the accident," Karppinen said. "The locks were broken, with some of 
the pins still left in the hinges."

JAPAN APOLOGIZES FOR ACTIONS BEFORE PEARL HARBOR ATTACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fifty-two years and 50 weeks after the event, Japan's government finally 
apologized Monday for failing to break off diplomatic negotiations before 
launching the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor that pulled the United States into 
World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 "There can be no excuse," the Foreign Ministry said, for Japan's delay in 
delivering a message to Washington on Dec. 7, 1941, that it would negotiate no 
longer. The official apology was prompted by the routine declassification of a 
new batch of documents relating to that fateful day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Monday's apology for Japanese diplomats' "deeply regrettable" conduct was 
not addressed to the United States, the victim of the attack. Rather, said 
Foreign Ministry spokesman Terusuke Terada, "the statement was directed to the 
people of Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 Why does the government feel a need to apologize to its own people for 
deceiving another nation half a century ago? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer involves the generalized concept of shame in Japanese society, and 
the particular sense of shame many Japanese feel about the beginning of World 
War II. 
</P>
<P>
 In the fall of 1941, the United States and Japan tried one last round of 
negotiations to resolve their angry dispute over Japanese aggression against 
China. While the talks were going on, a Japanese naval task force secretly 
sailed for Hawaii to attack Pearl Harbor. 
</P>
<P>
 On the morning of Dec. 7 -- or Dec. 8, on Japan's side of the international 
dateline -- Japan's Foreign Ministry sent a final message to the State 
Department. It was supposed to be delivered at 1 p.m. Washington time, just 25 
minutes before the raid was to begin. With characteristic vagueness, the cable 
did not clearly declare war or threaten attack. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Japanese diplomats at the embassy in Washington did not understand 
this to be a warning of imminent attack. They took their time in typing an 
English version and did not deliver the message until an hour after Pearl 
Harbor had been bombed.

ECOLOGY; LAKE'S CUTTHROAT COMPETITION RISES; A BIGGER, BULLY TROUT IS 
THREATENING THE NATIVE FISH AT YELLOWSTONE. AND THE MACKINAW MAY WIN OUT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL MILSTEIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When a young angler casting from fishing guide Tom Hansen's boat reeled in a 
mottled blue-green fish in July, Hansen knew immediately it was not a native 
cutthroat trout for which Yellowstone Lake is famous. 
</P>
<P>
 While Yellowstone cutthroats carry a distinctive red slash below their mouths, 
this fish had none. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was something that didn't belong," recalled Hansen, a teacher in 
Pittsburgh when he is not guiding anglers in Yellowstone National Park's 
largest lake. 
</P>
<P>
 Biologists have since confirmed that the fish was a lake trout, or Mackinaw, 
an intruder indeed. In following months, anglers and federal netting crews 
nabbed more of the exotic fish that experts now fear may wreak havoc on the 
largest intact ecosystem left in the Lower 48 states. 
</P>
<P>
 Lake trout pose a danger not only because they gobble smaller cutthroats, but 
also because by doing so, they could send shudders through the food chain that 
sustains wildlife from grizzly bears to birds of prey. 
</P>
<P>
 "This may be the beginning of a major change in the traditional picture of the 
Yellowstone ecosystem," U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service biologist Lynn Kaeding 
says as his motorboat skims the surface of the icy blue lake on a sunny but 
cold fall day. 
</P>
<P>
 Set amid snowy peaks at an elevation of 7,733 feet, Yellowstone Lake is the 
last stronghold of the Yellowstone cutthroat -- squeezed from 90% of its 
original range by human development and alien predators. The national park's 
cutthroat may be the largest undisturbed population of native trout left in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the first military caretakers of Yellowstone safeguarded local cutthroat 
from big and voracious lake trout, native only to Canada and the Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Government agencies brought the Eastern species to many Western waters, 
including empty lakes in Yellowstone, in a kind of Johnny Appleseed approach to 
fish management at the turn of the century. But they always spared 85,000-acre 
Yellowstone Lake and its prized cutthroat. 
</P>
<P>
 Catches this past summer, however, proved lake trout have finally invaded the 
largest high-altitude lake on the continent. There are no natural links between 
Yellowstone Lake and nearby waters containing lake trout, so rangers suspect 
renegade anglers seeking a new challenge surreptitiously planted the big fish. 
</P>
<P>
 Calling the action "an appalling act of environmental vandalism," Yellowstone 
managers are offering a $10,000 reward for information leading to the 
conviction of those responsible. 
</P>
<P>
 After discovery of the lake trout, rangers loosened rules so anglers can haul 
in all the out-of-place fish they want, provided they kill all they catch. Park 
biologists also are asking experts how to control the invading fish. Options 
include large-scale netting, poisoning of spawning grounds or introduction of 
sterile sea lampreys, which have attacked lake trout in the Great Lakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Scattered reports of lake trout in Yellowstone Lake had surfaced before, but 
authorities ignored them as erroneous. The varying sizes of fish caught this 
summer suggest the lake now holds lake trout of many different ages, evidence 
the species may have been multiplying here for years. 
</P>
<P>
 If that's true, fishery managers concede, there may already be too many of the 
alien fish to get rid of. 
</P>
<P>
 Female lake trout may produce 18,000 eggs a year for as many as 20 years. Such 
a horde leaves little room for cutthroat that lay fewer than one-tenth as many 
eggs. Lake trout grow as big as 50 pounds and can gulp a three-pound adult 
cutthroat with ease. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the worst of all possible creatures," says John Varley, Yellowstone's 
top scientist and an expert on cutthroat trout, pointing to a stuffed lake 
trout as big as a German shepherd on his office wall. "This is the epitome of a 
predator." 
</P>
<P>
 Long the sole inhabitants of many mountain lakes, cutthroat never evolved 
tactics to outwit such large predators. 
</P>
<P>
 Once lake trout arrived in Heart Lake, a smaller lake in the Yellowstone 
backcountry, cutthroat nearly vanished. In some alpine lakes in Colorado, 
Kaeding says, the aggressive fish erased a native species of cutthroat trout 
altogether. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can only guess how completely lake trout will take over," he says, 
watching a crew haul up nets cast into the lake to find out how many lake trout 
are present. "They could unseat bears and otters from the top of the food 
pyramid." 
</P>
<P>
 Cutthroat trout spawn in small streams each spring, while lake trout spawn in 
the fall only in deep water. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposite habits put lake trout beyond reach of grizzlies that look to 
spawning cutthroat for food when they emerge from winter hibernation. Osprey, 
pelicans, eagles and otters that feed in the shallows may also go hungry if 
cutthroat falter, since they cannot reach the 100-foot-plus depths where lake 
trout hover. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, fewer cutthroat spawned in one closely watched lake tributary than 
in any year since the mid-1960s, when overfishing depressed populations. 
Biologists blame the decline on drought and 1988 forest fires but acknowledge 
that they cannot rule out lake trout as a culprit.

HEALTH; SMOKY ISSUES IN DEBATE OVER NICOTINE PRODUCTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARLENE CIMONS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Should nicotine substitute products designed to help smokers quit cigarettes 
be available without a prescription? 
</P>
<P>
 It is an issue that almost has been overshadowed by the recent national debate 
over whether the federal government should regulate tobacco. Nevertheless, at 
least one manufacturer has asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration to 
consider changing the status of these products, which include gum and skin 
patches, to make them available over the counter. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents of the change argue that making these products more accessible 
would remove a major obstacle most smokers face in seeking help quitting the 
habit -- having to see a doctor to get a prescription. Granting 
over-the-counter status will help more people stop smoking, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 But other experts raise the very different and disturbing possibility that the 
easy availability of such items would only create new nicotine addicts. 
</P>
<P>
 "The classic argument (in favor of over-the-counter status) has been: To 
purchase nicotine in a form that will kill you, you can buy it from a vending 
machine in a shopping mall," said one anti-smoking lawyer knowledgeable in 
tobacco regulation. "To purchase it in a form that will help you quit smoking, 
you have to go to your doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a hard question," added the lawyer, who requested anonymity. "Making 
people go to a doctor is a barrier, and costs money. But what about kids, 
teen-agers, who don't smoke, but are looking for a little bit of a buzz? If 
it's sitting on the shelf of a mom-and-pop store or a pharmacy, and they can 
just walk in and buy it, will nicotine become the next buzz?" 
</P>
<P>
 Nicotine, which numerous health and drug abuse experts have declared 
addictive, is associated with heart disease and affects the brain and fetuses. 
The debate over the use of nicotine replacement products often has focused on 
whether users simply trade one harmful habit for another. 
</P>
<P>
 The health dangers from cigarettes -- which include lung cancer, emphysema and 
other respiratory ailments and heart disease -- come less from nicotine than 
from inhaling the toxic substances produced by burning the tobacco leaf, 
experts say. Also, nicotine from gum and patches is less rapidly absorbed by 
the body, and in less concentrations, than in cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 Smokers who use nicotine patches typically apply a new one each day, usually 
on an upper arm. At first, the patches usually provide dosage roughly 
equivalent to the amount of nicotine an average smoker takes in each day -- 
about 25 milligrams. The patch delivers that amount over each 24-hour period 
for about six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the course of the next month or six weeks, the amount of nicotine 
dispensed by the patch is gradually lowered to enable the smoker to become 
accustomed to less and avoid the symptoms of abrupt withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Jack Henningfield, chief of clinical pharmacology research at the National 
Institute on Drug Abuse, stressed that "not all nicotine medications are 
created equal." 
</P>
<P>
 An experimental nicotine nasal spray not yet on the market, for example, has 
proved very successful in clinical studies. However, many individuals became 
hooked on the spray and found it extraordinarily difficult to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 One dose -- two sprays -- of the nasal drug delivers 1 milligram of nicotine. 
But unlike the gum and patch therapies, the spray delivers a faster and more 
direct hit of the drug, similar to cigarettes. 
</P>
<P>
 For this reason, an FDA advisory panel last summer said the nasal nicotine 
drug had significant potential for abuse. If that application is approved, the 
panel recommended strictly controlling it by prescription, limiting the number 
of refills and requiring strong warnings. 
</P>
<P>
 In contrast, "the majority of people who go from cigarettes to gum or the 
patch don't become similarly addicted," Henningfield said. 
</P>
<P>
 The gum and the patch are "incredibly gentle" forms of nicotine delivery 
compared to cigarettes, "so gentle that many clinicians think you need more 
aggressive forms of nicotine delivery to treat heavier addicted smokers," he 
said. "For those who stay on the medication longer than the original 
prescription, that's when you get into a debate: Is it legitimate medical need? 
Or abuse?"

 U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, warning that organized crime is 
a "poison" threatening democracy, urged governments Monday to fight back 
against the growing power of the world's criminal networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening a three-day ministerial conference on cross-border crime, he told 
delegates from 138 countries that the tentacles of "crime multinationals" had 
spread across the globe. 
</P>

 The conference is the highest-level meeting called by the United Nations on

LOW TURNOUT MARS UKRAINE ELECTIONS

<P>
 Weekend parliamentary by-elections in Ukraine filled just nine of 56 vacant 
seats as voters stayed away in droves, election officials said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 They said a second round will be held in two weeks for four seats where 
turnout was more than 50% Sunday, but no candidate won an overall majority. 
Elections for the remaining 43 seats will be put off indefinitely. 
</P>
<P>
 This was the third round of parliamentary voting since March in addition to 
two rounds of presidential elections. Most Ukrainians, buffeted by post-Soviet 
economic hardships, have simply lost interest in turning out to vote.

GOP SAYS BLACK CAUCUS FUNDS NOT TARGETED FOR ELIMINATION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Republicans denied Monday that they are targeting the Congressional Black 
Caucus for elimination but said its funding is being examined as part of an 
across-the-board look at groups of House members. 
</P>
<P>
 Funding for the 41-member Black Caucus "will not selectively be removed," said 
Rep. Jim Nussle of Iowa, who heads the Republicans' House transition team."I 
think that's unrealistic." 
</P>
<P>
 Newsweek reports in its Nov. 28 editions that "new GOP officials plan simply 
to eliminate funding for the Congressional Black Caucus. Members will be able 
to meet informally but without the staff support that had helped make the group 
into a potent political organization." 
</P>
<P>
 Nussle said at his regular daily briefing that House Republicans may eliminate 
money for many of the 30 such groups in the House. 
</P>
<P>
 Known in House jargon as "legislative service organizations," these groups 
include the Steel Caucus, Sunbelt Caucus, Arms Control and Foreign Policy group 
and others formed along regional, commercial or ideological lines. 
</P>
<P>
 The groups -- which get space, telephones, staff and equipment from funds 
members cede from their office budgets -- have long been a target of Rep. Pat 
Roberts (R-Kan.), who has charged that they failed to account for millions of 
dollars in funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberts is a key member of the Republican transition team.

SHEIK'S ILLNESS DELAYS BOMBING PLOT TRIAL; NEW YORK: MUSLIM CLERIC AND 11 OTHER 
DEFENDANTS ARE ACCUSED OF A TERRORIST CONSPIRACY AS PART OF A U.S. JIHAD. COURT 
DATE IS MOVED TO JANUARY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge on Monday postponed until early January the trial of Sheik 
Omar Abdel Rahman and 11 other defendants charged with plotting a war of urban 
terrorism, because the blind Egyptian cleric remains hospitalized with 
pneumonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers said they expected Abdel Rahman, 56, who is diabetic and has 
heart disease, to return to his cell by the end of the week but that he would 
be too weak to stand trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have any choice," Judge Michael B. Mukasey said, postponing jury 
selection until Jan. 9. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a 100-page memorandum opposing defendants' pretrial motions, the 
government contends that as early as 1989, an Islamic jihad organization 
existed in the United States which trained for, planned and carried out 
terrorist acts in New York, including the World Trade Center bombing in 
February, 1993, and the assassination of Rabbi Meir Kahane, founder of the 
militant Jewish Defense League, in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charge that Abdel Rahman became the leader of the U.S. jihad and 
"played a key role both in articulating and defining" its organization and 
acts. When the trial begins, the government will argue that the sheik "provided 
necessary counsel" on whether acts of terrorism "were permissible or forbidden 
under his radical interpretation of Islamic law." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also plan to introduce evidence that the killing of Kahane 
immediately after his speech at the Marriott East Side Hotel on Nov. 5, 1990, 
was planned and carried out to further the aims of the jihad. 
</P>
<P>
 The government will charge that El Sayyid Nosair shot Kahane and was assisted 
by other members of a jihad and that the fingerprints of Mohammed A. Salameh 
and Nidal Ayyad, two of the defendants convicted of bombing the World Trade 
Center, were found in Nosair's car, which was abandoned in a no-parking zone 
near the hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 The court papers also charge that Mahmud Abouhalima, a third Trade Center 
defendant who was found guilty, "was the intended getaway driver and failed to 
station himself properly for the anticipated rendezvous with Nosair." 
</P>
<P>
 A New York state jury acquitted Nosair of murder but convicted him of weapon 
charges. Prosecutors charge members of the jihad planned political kidnapings 
in an effort to free Nosair from the state prison where he is serving more than 
20 years. He is one of the defendants in the upcoming federal trial. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors charged that Nosair organized paramilitary training for jihad 
members both in the United States and overseas. After his arrest, court papers 
charge that Nosair continued to consult with other jihad members about acts of 
terrorism. 
</P>
<P>
 Abdel Rahman has been in prison for more than a year. Prosecutors say the 
targets of the conspiracy included the United Nations, two tunnels linking New 
York with New Jersey and the federal building housing the Manhattan field 
office of the FBI. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyers on Monday tried to have an alleged conversation between the 
sheik and Emad Ali Salem striken from evidence. Salem was the sheik's bodyguard 
and is now the government's chief informant in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 According to court papers, Salem asked Abdel Rahman what he thought about the 
plan to bomb the federal building. When Salem indicated that the plan was in 
motion, the cleric allegedy responded: "It doesn't matter. Slow down. Slow down 
a little bit. The one who killed Kennedy was trained for three years." 
</P>
<P>
 Lawyers in the case say the reference apparently is to Sirhan Sirhan, the 
Jordanian immigrant who assassinated Sen. Robert F. Kennedy while he was 
campaigning in Los Angeles for the presidency in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendants also are charged with planning to kill Egyptian President Hosni 
Mubarak during a trip to New York to address the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "The evidence the government seeks to introduce in connection with the Kahane 
homicide and the Mubarak murder plot is directly relevant proof that the 
defendants were members of a terrorist conspiracy which viewed the West as a 
monolithic enemy, under the direction of the United States, that oppressed 
Muslims and was a lifeline to Israel and Zionists," prosecutors said in the 
memorandum. 
</P>
<P>
 The memorandum further charged that the agreement to "wage war" against the 
United States was "fully operational before the Kahane homicide." 
</P>
<P>
 "The attack on Rabbi Kahane did not occur in a vacuum," prosecutors said. "It 
was a small, albeit brutal, step in a terrorist campaign which comprehended not 
only assassinations of individuals but the mass destruction of political, 
social and economic assets of the 'infidel' West, of which the United States 
was deemed the leader."

<P>
 A beauty queen is guilty only of "foolishness and stupidity" and did not plot 
the death of her pregnant romantic rival and the woman's family, a defense 
lawyer said Monday in closing arguments. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors deliberated the fate of Tracy Lippard, 23, for six hours Monday in 
Greenbrier County Circuit Court.They were scheduled to resume today. 
</P>
<P>
 Lippard is charged with three counts of attempted murder and battery, as well 
as some misdemeanors. If convicted of all charges, she faces up to 30 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense lawyer Paul Detch said Lippard was upset because her ex-boyfriend 
didn't attend the Miss Williamsburg pageant, when she transferred her crown. 
</P>
<P>
 "I ask that you be kind to Tracy," Detch said. "My client is guilty of 
foolishness and stupidity . . . but I submit she is a kind person."

4 SAVED, 1 KILLED AS FIRE LADDER COLLAPSES; EMERGENCY: FIREFIGHTER IS CREDITED 
WITH SAVING TWO CHILDREN AFTER EQUIPMENT BUCKLES. ALSO SURVIVING IS THE MOTHER, 
BUT THE FATHER FALLS TO HIS DEATH.

 A firefighter was cradling two children in his arms and guiding their parents 
to safety from a sixth-floor window in Brooklyn when the ladder they were on 
twisted and collapsed. The father leaped free, and died in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The mother, who was thrown clear, and their children, ages 4 and 6, were in 
critical but stable condition Monday. The firefighter's condition was serious, 
a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 The ladder "looked like a pretzel," said witness George Rosario, a baker. 
"I've got to give credit to the fireman because if he hadn't been holding those 
kids, they probably would have been killed too." 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighter Greg Smith was near the top of the lightweight aluminum alloy 
ladder Sunday when it buckled, throwing the mother, Aqueda Santana, 31, clear. 
The father, Yreno Espanoso, 37, jumped to his death. Smith gripped the 
children, Lissetto, 6, and Edwin, 4, and the three rode the ladder to the 
ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew had extended the 3-year-old ladder 91 feet up from the truck to reach 
residents trapped on the top floor of the brick apartment building. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters at the scene speculated that the weight on the top of the ladder 
might have contributed to the collapse, but officials said the ladder should 
have been able to bear the weight. They were investigating. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators also will investigate whether proper procedures were followed. 
Officials said only one of the ladder's upright posts was secured against the 
building, and firefighters might have been able to set up inside a metal gate 
to get a better angle, though that might have taken longer. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Fire Commander William Feehan said the setup was understandable given 
the urgency of the rescue effort, and did not violate department policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Ladders are used by fire companies across the country. They will continue to 
be used despite the accident, several big city fire departments, including New 
York's, said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Seagrave Aerial, based in Clintonville, Wis., has "been in business for 100 
years" and its ladders are used in every major city, said Tom Kniaz, chief of 
apparatus of the Detroit Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 27 in nearby Yonkers, a nearly identical Seagrave rear-mount ladder 
also twisted as firefighters battled a blaze. The only difference was that the 
Yonkers ladder buckled about 25 feet up while the one in Brooklyn twisted near 
the bottom. 
</P>
<P>
 One firefighter was injured in the Yonkers incident when the ladder crashed 
onto an adjacent roof. As in the Brooklyn incident, the ladder was fully 
extended, said Yonkers Fire Commissioner Neil Curry. 
</P>
<P>
 Seagrave Aerial would not give specifics on the ladder's recommended use and 
company spokesman Joe Kaufmann would not offer details of the equipment's 
safety record.

GOP SAID TO BE PLANNING FOOD WELFARE CUTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republicans taking over Congress in January will propose a welfare bill that 
eliminates a bedrock principal of social welfare programs: that anyone 
qualifying for benefits automatically gets them, a newspaper reports in today's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the Republican proposal, people now eligible for welfare, food stamps 
and free school lunches would no longer have a legally enforceable right to 
such assistance, known as entitlements, the New York Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The effort to control social spending would also require state welfare 
officials to provide the Immigration and Naturalization Service "with the 
names, address and other identifying information" of illegal immigrants whose 
children are U.S. citizens, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican measure would repeal the Emergency Food Assistance Act of 1983, 
the Food Stamp Act of 1977, the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 and the National 
School Lunch Act of 1946, the newspaper reported. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, under the Republican proposal, specific sums would be appropriated 
each year for food assistance and welfare to the states. If the money ran out 
before the end of the year, benefits could be cut, people could be removed from 
the rolls or new applicants could be turned away, depending on decisions made 
by the states. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton has called for overhauling the welfare system focusing on 
job training and limits on the duration of welfare payments, not on food 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans told the newspaper that their plan would save money and force 
Congress to face the cost of welfare and food assistance, rather than allowing 
the programs to continue automatically. 
</P>
<P>
 The Republican bill, the Personal Responsibility Act, lists 60 programs, 
including Medicaid, maternal and child health care, the Women, Infants and 
Children nutrition program, aid to homeless people and screening youngsters to 
detect lead poisoning, the newspaper said.

CELEBRATING STRENGTH IN NUMBERS, GOP GOVERNORS SEEK POWER SHIFT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Republican governors asserted Monday that they hold the key to the country's 
prosperity and demanded that Congress give them the power to institute sweeping 
economic and social reforms. 
</P>
<P>
 Flexing their political muscle after gaining victories in this month's 
elections, 30 Republican governors and governors-elect maintained that they had 
won a broad mandate from the people to institute less-centralized government. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Election Day the people of America said, 'We've had it with Washington,' " 
said Virginia Gov. George F. Allen, who is host of the three-day meeting of the 
Republican Governors Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have as governors the duty and responsibility to lead the way in bringing 
back to the people the principled, trustworthy, accountable and non-interfering 
government that they want," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One proposal under discussion at Williamsburg is a constitutional amendment to 
allow three-quarters of the states acting together to repeal what Allen called 
"improper or intrusive federal laws." 
</P>
<P>
 Republicans won majorities in the Senate and the House for the first time in 
40 years in the Nov. 8 elections. They also captured at least 11 governorships 
from the Democrats and now hold at least 30 states, the most they have 
controlled since 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 The Democrats control 17 states and seem likely to add Alaska and Maryland, 
where close elections were still in dispute Monday. One state was won by an 
independent. 
</P>
<P>
 The Williamsburg gathering has taken on the character of a huge victory 
celebration. Republican National Committee Chairman Haley Barbour received a 
standing ovation after laying out in detail the dimensions of the Republican 
landslide at all levels of government and in all parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
 He attributed a great part of the success to the example of Republican 
incumbent governors who cut taxes and shrank state governments. Barbour noted 
that all 10 Republican governors up for reelection won, seven of them with more 
than 60% of the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Incoming House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) is to meet with the governors 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, Gingrich agreed with the assessment that the stage could be set for 
a major transfer of political power from the federal government to the 50 
states. 
</P>
<P>
 "My sense is that there's an opportunity for a new federalism that could be 
very dramatic and very bold," Gingrich said at a news conference after 
returning from a weekend cruise financed by the conservative National Review 
Institute. 
</P>
<P>
 Gingrich said he looked forward to cooperation from President Clinton and 
noted that the White House also is working to consolidate departments and 
reduce overhead.

<TEXT>
<P>
 Under rainy skies, with the Navy's top brass in attendance, a pioneer female 
fighter pilot was buried Monday in a quiet military ceremony at Arlington 
National Cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 An honor guard carried the silver coffin of Lt. Kara Hultgreen to her grave.An 
earlier service had been held in San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 A bugler played taps, the Navy band played "America the Beautiful" and a rifle 
team fired three volleys in tribute. 
</P>
<P>
 Hultgreen, 29, one of the first two women to qualify for Navy carrier 
operations in the F-14A jet fighter, crashed in the Pacific Ocean on Oct. 25, 
about 50 miles off San Diego. The cause of the crash is still to be determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Before she left the grave site, Hultgreen's mother, Sally Spears, lightly 
touched the coffin and then gave a long glance back, all the while clutching 
the flag that had covered it.

1 KILLED, 28 RESCUED IN COAL SHIP BLAZE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One crew member died but all 28 others aboard a burning Cypriot coal ship 
adrift about 200 miles south of Nantucket have been plucked to safety, the U.S. 
Coast Guard said Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Coast Guard officials said four crew members who had remained on board the 
Greek-owned bulk carrier Polydora to fight the blaze abandoned ship early 
Monday and were rescued by a Coast Guard cutter. 
</P>
<P>
 A Coast Guard spokesman said the fire was still raging in the ship's cabins, 
but was not believed to have spread to the engine room or cargo area of the 
vessel, which is loaded with coal. The ship was not sinking, he said.

PLEDGES OF FOOD, HELP FLOOD SCHOOL; HUNGER: ABOUT 250 VOLUNTEERS TAKE ACTION 
AFTER LEARNING THAT A QUARTER OF STUDENTS AT EDGEWOOD MIDDLE SCHOOL IN WEST 
COVINA ARE COMING TO CLASS UNDERNOURISHED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONIA NAZARIO, TIMES URBAN AFFAIRS WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 West Covina's Edgewood Middle School, profiled in a Times story Sunday as an 
example of a school that does not serve federally funded breakfasts to 
low-income students, was deluged by more than 250 phone calls Monday as people 
from as far away as Santa Barbara offered to donate their time and money to 
ensure that Edgewood students don't go to school hungry. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the West Covina Unified School District's board, which has not 
applied to the government for breakfast funds, said it will consider whether to 
do so at a Dec. 13 board meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 In its Sunday article, The Times detailed how teachers nationwide are 
grappling with an increasing number of students who come to class hungry, 
crippling their chances to learn. School officials estimate that one in four 
children come to Edgewood undernourished. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times story outlined how schools have failed to offer one available 
remedy: school breakfast, a federal entitlement program. Currently, 37% of the 
13.6 million low-income children who get a subsidized lunch also eat a morning 
meal at school. Edgewood and the West Covina district's 10 other schools do not 
offer the morning meal to low-income students. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has to be action taken to make sure children are fed. We want to get a 
resolution to this," said West Covina Mayor Bradley McFadden, who said he has 
asked the city manager to look into whether the city can press the school 
district to start a breakfast program. "The goal is to make sure students have 
an environment they can learn in and aren't hungry," McFadden said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, citizens took matters into their own hands at Edgewood on Monday. 
One parent offered to take hungry families to a supermarket and stock them with 
food staples. Four offered to adopt hungry families until they can get on their 
feet. Two families pledged 55 food baskets. Twenty turkeys arrived, with more 
on the way. Some simply donated cash. The local Kaiser Permanente hospital 
offered to permanently stock the school nurse station with snacks. And on 
Monday afternoon, another family dropped off 300 pounds of rice and promised to 
bring 30 turkeys to go with the rice Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am enormously touched by the outpouring of concern," said Assistant 
Principal Amelia Esposito. "They ask me, "How much can I give? This is wrong. 
Children shouldn't be hungry in this country.' " 
</P>
<P>
 School board President Mike Spence said that, on philosophical grounds, he 
still opposes a government-paid school breakfast program for children. Some 
conservatives oppose the programs, calling them anti-family and a usurpation by 
schools of a parent's responsibility. Spence said he nonetheless believes that 
"there is probably a majority on the board" who would approve breakfast funds. 
He said board members had received an informational memo about breakfast 
programs two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 If such a measure passed, Spence said, "we would be allowing parents to shirk 
their responsibilities. And we would send a message to kids that is demeaning. 
We would say: 'Your parents can't take care of you, so we have to.' Some of 
these parents are on dope. They should be reported to social services 
(agencies) for neglect, as required by law." 
</P>
<P>
 Spence said an individual he declined to identify has offered to collect 
donations and have volunteers serve breakfast to students at Edgewood rather 
than rely on the government to address a social problem.

STATE SCHOOL BOARD ORDERS PLAN FOR IMPLEMENTING 187; IMMIGRATION: EMERGENCY 
REGULATIONS ARE SEEN AS A CONTINGENCY MEASURE. MEMBERS INDICATE THEY WILL 
REMAIN NEUTRAL IN SUITS CHALLENGING THE PROPOSITION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The state Board of Education on Monday ordered the preparation of emergency 
regulations for implementing Proposition 187's ban on illegal immigrants in 
public schools, but also indicated that it would remain neutral on the various 
lawsuits that seek to block the voter-approved ballot measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The board is one of the defendants in at least seven lawsuits challenging the 
constitutionality or legality of the measure, which seeks to deny illegal 
immigrants access to non-emergency health and public services as well as to 
public education. The proposition would require school and health officials to 
report those who are suspected of being illegal to federal authorities. 
</P>
<P>
 The state board did not take a position on the measure before the election, 
even though all of its members were appointed or reappointed by Gov. Pete 
Wilson, a leading voice in favor of the measure. The board on Monday chose to 
maintain that neutrality by deciding to have the state attorney general, rather 
than lawyers for the Department of Education, which the board oversees, 
represent its interests in those lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaintiffs in those lawsuits include the Los Angeles Unified School 
District and the Los Angeles City Council, as well as private education and 
immigrants rights groups. 
</P>
<P>
 In a private session, the board also voted unanimously to have education 
officials write regulations that "ensure fair, consistent, orderly, uniform and 
non-discriminatory administration" of Proposition 187's provisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Marion McDowell of San Carlos characterized the decision to 
move ahead with the writing of regulations as "contingency planning." Having 
Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren take the lead in defending the board in the lawsuits, 
which also target Wilson and other arms of state government, preserves 
education funds for education, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Had they not been challenged, the education provisions of the proposition 
would have taken effect Jan. 1. But U.S. District Judge Matthew Byrne, acting 
last week in four lawsuits filed by Proposition 187 proponents, temporarily 
blocked enforcement of most of the provisions of the sweeping measure but 
allowed agencies to develop regulations as long as they remain secret. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Mariana R. Pfaelzer will hold a status conference today to 
establish the date for a hearing on requests by initiative foes for a 
preliminary injunction, designed to block implementation of the initiative 
until its legality is determined in extended court hearings. 
</P>
<P>
 In a related matter on Monday, during a news conference at Los Angeles Unified 
School District headquarters a group of parents and teachers reiterated their 
support for the district's decision to file suit against Proposition 187. 
</P>
<P>
 Several parents and community organizers also announced that they plan to ask 
the United Nations to send human rights monitors to Los Angeles to view alleged 
abuses both now and later, if the anti-illegal immigration measure is 
implemented. They intend to gather 2,000 signatures asking for the assistance 
and send them to the United Nations on Dec. 10, International Human Rights Day.

PROPOSED MENTAL TESTS WEIGHED FOR WELFARE APPLICANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual step, Contra Costa County officials here are proposing that 
welfare applicants be required to take a mental health test before picking up 
their checks. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for the poor are threatening to sue, denouncing the plan as punitive 
and mean-spirited. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's ridiculous," said Robert Newman, an attorney for the Western 
Center on Law and Poverty in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 County officials maintain that the test is not intended as a punishment -- 
applicants do not have to pass it to get benefits -- and it has not yet been 
imposed. It was put on hold after the uproar and is under review. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess they don't like the fact that we're thinking about doing this," said 
John Lee, a welfare division manager for the social services department. 
</P>
<P>
 Giving answers that indicated a problem would simply result in the person 
being offered psychological help, Lee said. But refusing to take the test at 
all could result in a loss of benefits for up to six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates have proposed an effort to identify recipients in need of mental 
health services. But they say a mandatory test would turn a helping hand into a 
threat.

TRANSPLANT OF SPERM-MAKING CELLS REPORTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Newsday 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first experiments showing that it is possible to transplant sperm-making 
cells from one animal into another were reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In experiments at the University of Pennsylvania, reproductive physiologist 
Ralph Brinster made one mouse produce sperm that carry the genes -- the 
biological inheritance -- of another mouse. 
</P>
<P>
 By simply transplanting the sperm-making cells -- spermatogonia -- from one 
mouse into another, he permanently changed the recipient's sperm, so it carried 
only the donor's genes. 
</P>
<P>
 The experiments were done in mice that were naturally sterile, or in mice 
whose sperm stem cells had been killed by chemical treatments. 
</P>
<P>
 Two reports to be published today in the Proceedings of the National Academy 
of Sciences by Brinster and two co-workers show, in essence, that it is 
possible to transfer one family's genetic inheritance directly into the male 
reproductive system of another.

PROSTATE CANCER MAY HAVE ROOTS IN GENETIC DEFECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Prostate cancer may be closely linked to a genetic defect that hampers the 
body's defenses against environmental carcinogens, researchers from Johns 
Hopkins University have found. 
</P>
<P>
 Writing in the latest issue of Proceedings of the National Academy of 
Sciences, the researchers said they had found what appeared to be the most 
common genetic flaw linked to the cancer, which strikes about 165,000 American 
men yearly. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we'd have to view this as a tremendous clue," said the leader of the 
study, Dr. William Nelson, an assistant professor of oncology and urology. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's present in almost all of the (prostate) cancers, so it's got to be 
telling us something," Nelson said in a telephone interview. "I think the key 
is, are we going to be clever enough to figure out what it means." 
</P>
<P>
 The genetic defect found in nearly all of the 91 prostate cancers studied 
blocked production of an enzyme that guards against cancer-causing substances 
in the environment. The flaw was not present in the prostates of healthy 
individuals. 
</P>
<P>
 "A deficiency in the production of this enzyme may render normal prostate 
cells more vulnerable to carcinogens in the environment," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The flaw discovered by the researchers is in the molecular makeup of one of 
the strands of the DNA, or genetic blueprint, rather than in the order in which 
the strands rest. 
</P>
<P>
 That implies that the flaw is potentially treatable with drugs, Nelson said. 
He said scientists working in a laboratory were able to use drugs to make the 
problem gene work again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whether this can ever be done in people or not is not clear," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier studies have shown that high-level production of similar enzymes is 
stimulated by consumption of "cruciferous" vegetables such as broccoli, 
cauliflower and Brussels sprouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson said it is too early to say whether a change in diet can help. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said it may be possible to use the enzyme to screen substances thought 
to be possible carcinogens.

PERSONAL FINANCE / KATHY M. KRISTOF: YOUR MONEY: SPOTLIGHT ON TAXES; FROM OUT 
OF THE RUBBLE; CASUALTY LOSSES CAN MEAN A BIG BREAK AT TAX TIME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The first good news Linda Laxson has had since the Northridge quake shattered 
her personal effects and cracked apart the walls in her Tarzana townhome is 
that Uncle Sam stands ready to give her a substantial tax break. 
</P>
<P>
 Getting it, however, won't be easy. 
</P>
<P>
 Laxson, whose townhome suffered roughly $26,000 in damage, will need to revise 
her tax return from last year to get the biggest bang out of her casualty loss 
buck. Hundreds of other victims of the Southern California quake will either 
have to compile exhaustive listings of how much they paid for their belongings 
or find ways to reduce their taxable income if they want to claim this 
potentially lucrative tax loss. 
</P>
<P>
 Casualty loss rules are tricky. But those who negotiate them well can reap 
hundreds of dollars in tax savings. 
</P>
<P>
 How do casualty losses work? And what can you do to get the biggest bang for 
your buck? Some questions and answers. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What is a casualty loss? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Any unreimbursed loss to real property from fire, flood, earthquake, theft 
or any other sudden, unexpected or unusual event. However, stock market 
reversals, no matter how inexplicable, are not casualties. They fall in the 
category of capital losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Do I get to deduct the whole loss? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A No. You can deduct only the portion that exceeds 10% of your adjusted gross 
income plus $100. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if you had adjusted gross income of $50,000 and a $10,000 
casualty loss, you would be able to deduct $4,900 of the loss. That's $10,000 
minus 10% of your adjusted gross income ($5,000) minus $100. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q That's a high threshold. Is there any way of lowering the bar? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A If you can reduce your adjusted gross income, you get a bigger casualty 
loss, says Robert Sullivan, tax partner at Stonefield Josephson, a Santa 
Monica-based certified public accounting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q How do I do that? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Contribute as much as possible to a tax-deferred retirement account, such as 
a deductible IRA, 401(k) or Keogh plan. Recognize capital losses in your 
investment portfolio, or defer income. If you are self-employed, you may also 
want to push discretionary business expenses into the current year to reduce 
your self-employment income, Sullivan says. 
</P>
<P>
 But don't defer so much income that you go into a higher tax bracket next 
year, warns Gregg Ritchie, partner in the personal financial planning group at 
KPMG Peat Marwick. Paying tax in a higher bracket in 1995 can cost you more 
than you saved with the boosted 1994 casualty loss. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q How much can tax planning really boost my casualty loss? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Let's say our $50,000 wage earner opted to contribute $8,000 to a 401(k) and 
recognize a $3,000 capital loss from a money-losing stock. That reduces his 
adjusted gross income to $39,000 and increases his casualty loss deduction to 
$6,000 ($10,000 minus $3,900 minus $100). Assuming he's in the 28% tax bracket, 
that saves him $1,680 in taxes -- $308 more than he would have gotten if he had 
taken no steps to reduce his income. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q How about boosting my itemized deductions? Does that help? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A No. While itemized deductions reduce your taxable income, they do not affect 
your adjusted gross income, which is the number used to determine the 
deductible portion of your casualty losses. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q My income was much lower in 1993 than it was this year, which would make it 
easier to get a deduction for my casualty. Is there any way I can push my 
casualty loss into last year's tax return and claim a refund? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Yes. In federally designated disaster areas, you get the option of claiming 
the loss in either the year it happened or in the previous year. If you would 
get a bigger deduction by claiming the losses on last year's return, you can 
file a 1040X form -- an amended return -- and have the IRS send you a refund 
for the tax savings you realized by claiming the casualty loss in that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Incidentally, this is exactly what Laxson is doing, but for a somewhat 
different reason. She lost her job in 1994, so she's paying very little tax 
this year. If she pushes the deductions into 1993 -- a year in which she paid 
tax on roughly $48,000 in income -- she stands to get a more substantial 
refund. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Are there any tricks to determining the extent of my loss? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Plenty. The IRS' favorite method for determining your loss is an appraisal 
method, says Ritchie. In essence, the taxpayer gets appraisals before and after 
the disaster. The difference in value is the extent of your loss, with some 
caveats. 
</P>
<P>
 The first caveat is that a temporary drop in value due to "resistance" to 
buying a home in a disaster zone has to be factored out. That's because such 
reluctance is temporary and presumably will evaporate without any capital 
outlay on your part. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q How do you determine how much of the loss is due to buyer resistance? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A There's no foolproof answer, says Ritchie. It's a subjective determination 
you arrive at with the help of an appraiser or a tax professional. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Is there a less subjective way to determine the loss? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Yes. The value of your loss can also be established by the cost of repair. 
This method is less appealing to the IRS, but it's easier to substantiate, 
accountants say. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q So, my casualty loss is just the cost of repairs minus any insurance 
reimbursements? 
</P>
<P>
 *

 A Sometimes, but not always. If the cost to repair is greater than your "tax 
basis" -- what you paid to buy and improve the property -- your deduction is 
limited to the lower of the two. 
</P>

<P>
 Q I bought my home ages ago for a fraction of what it's worth today. As a 
result, my insurance reimbursement was substantially more than the original 
cost of the property. Do I have a casualty gain? 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 A Very likely, says Ritchie. Consider a hypothetical consumer, Jane Quaker, 
who bought her house for $80,000 and made $5,000 in improvements over the 
years. Her adjusted basis is $85,000. If the insurer gives her $90,000 to 
repair earthquake damage, she has a $5,000 casualty gain, he notes. The gain 
will increase your tax basis in the house, however, which can be useful later. 
</P>
<P>
 In a few instances, there may have been a step-up in basis that would 
eliminate the casualty gain. That would happen, for example, if you were 
married and owned the home jointly with a spouse who died sometime after the 
home's purchase. At the time of your spouse's death, the tax basis in the home 
is kicked up to the value of the property at the date of death.

ORANGE COUNTY JOBLESS RATE FALLS BY NEARLY FULL PERCENTAGE POINT TO 5.1%; 
UNEMPLOYMENT: OCTOBER FIGURE IS DOWN SHARPLY FROM 7% LAST YEAR. REAL ESTATE 
STILL LAGS. 
</P>

<P>
 Reflecting Southern California's brightening employment picture, Orange 
County's jobless rate plunged by nearly a full percentage point in October to 
5.1%, the lowest level in nearly three years and down sharply from 7% a year 
earlier, the state Employment Development Department reported Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Buoyed by gains in the services sector, Orange County's economy expanded by 
4,800 payroll jobs last month from September, when the jobless rate was 6%. The 
number of unemployed in the county fell by 14%, to 68,800. And October marked 
the county's first year-to-year gain in payroll jobs since early 1991, 
prompting analysts to declare that the local economy has finally shaken off its 
slump and is growing. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first time we are signaling an expansion," said Esmael Adibi, 
director of the Center for Economic Research at Chapman University in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 While Orange County continues to take its hits in aerospace and other 
manufacturing industries, it has seen gains in such diverse areas such as 
apparel, health care and international trade. 
</P>
<P>
 In Southern California, "the bright light is Orange County," said Jack Kyser, 
economist for the Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 As previously reported, Los Angeles County's jobless rate for October was 
7.8%, down from 8.3% in September. The jobless rates for Riverside, San 
Bernardino and Ventura counties also dropped in October, reports released 
Monday show, but each of those areas lagged the state's performance. 
</P>
<P>
 California's jobless rate for October stood at 7.7%, down from 8.3% the 
previous month. Statewide, total employment is still off about 300,000 jobs 
from its peak in June, 1990. Nationally, unemployment dipped a tenth of a 
percentage point last month to 5.8%, the lowest rate in four years. 
</P>
<P>
 The jobless rate in Orange County is now at its lowest since December, 1991, 
when it reached 4.8% before beginning a steady climb during the recession. 
Unemployment in Orange County peaked at 7.9% in July, 1993, but has since edged 
downward. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday's report showed that 1.28 million people in the county were working in 
October -- up nearly 30,000 from September and an increase of 40,000 over 
October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Like California and the nation, Orange County has seen its job market boosted 
by continuing growth in the temporary help industry. In October, that accounted 
for a big part of the county's 2,100 new payroll jobs in the services sector. 
</P>
<P>
 Gene Wilson, president of Thomas Temporaries, an Irvine-based firm with 19 
offices in Southern California, said many businesses in the region are still 
reluctant to hire regular employees permanently, so they call on firms like 
his. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's economy also saw healthy job gains in the amusement industry, 
health services and educational services. The county also added 400 retail and 
wholesale trade jobs last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction jobs in the county were down 100 in October from the previous 
month, to 45,600. But that was still up by 1,100 jobs from October, 1993, 
mostly in specialty trades such as plumbing and carpentry. 
</P>
<P>
 The only sector that showed significant weakness last month was the finance 
and real estate industry, which lost 900 jobs, mainly because of lingering 
troubles in the banking community, where consolidation and closures are 
continuing.

WAVE OF SELLING SENDS THE DOW SOUTH OF 3,800; MARKETS: HIGHER BOND MARKET 
YIELDS ARE BLAMED AS THE AVERAGE GIVES UP 45.75 POINTS.

<P>
 Investors dumped stocks Monday, pulling the Dow Jones industrial average down 
nearly 46 points amid concern that this year's interest rate hikes will draw 
investors into the bond market and out of stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow, the market's best-known indicator, ended the day with a loss of 45.75 
points, or 1.20%, at 3,769.51, its lowest closing since Aug. 22. The average 
had not closed below 3,800 since Oct. 7. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the bond market's higher yields have made fixed-income 
securities an increasingly attractive alternative to the risks of the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 The blue-chip index rose as much as 18 points in the first 30 minutes of 
trading, but it fell to post modest losses for most of the session as Treasury 
bond prices deteriorated, pushing up yields. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Dow broke below the critical 3,800 level, it was a signal for other 
investors to step in with sell orders. 
</P>
<P>
 A wave of late selling pushed the Dow down more than 50 points, a threshold 
that prompted the New York Stock Exchange to restrict high-volume computerized 
trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, bond yields ended unchanged Monday. The 30-year bond yield closed 
at 8.12%, the same as Friday's close. Its price edged up 1/32 point, or 31 
cents per $1,000 in face value. 
</P>
<P>
 Three-year Treasuries are yielding 7.52%, while five-year notes are yielding 
7.80%. 
</P>
<P>
 In the broader market, declining issues outnumbered those rising by about 15 
to 8 on the New York Stock Exchange. Volume was moderate ahead of the 
Thanksgiving holiday, with 293 million shares changing hands, up from 252.30 
million last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Broad market indexes also fell. The NYSE's composite index declined 1.72 
points to 250.58. The Standard & Poor's 500-stock index slid 3.18 points to 
458.29. The Nasdaq composite of mostly smaller companies lost 6.93 points to 
757.74. And the American Stock Exchange market value index fell 2.76 points to 
441.28. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the stock market was still troubled by last week's Federal 
Reserve Board move to boost short-term interest rates by a steep three-quarters 
of a percentage point to curb inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development further unnerved 
traders Monday with a statement saying the United States must raise interest 
rates substantially over the next year to contain inflation and keep the 
economic expansion on track. 
</P>
<P>
 The Paris-based OECD acts as a think tank for rich industrial countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Of the 30 Dow components, eight stocks lost a point or more. United 
Technologies fell 1 5/8 to 57 3/8, J.P. Morgan slid 7/8 to 57 1/4, Eastman 
Kodak lost 1 3/8 to 47 1/4, Philip Morris dropped 1 1/4 at 61 1/2, and American 
Express fell 1 1/4 to 29 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks outperformed the rest of the market. Intel rose 2 3/16 to 
66 1/8 after Merrill Lynch raised its rating on the stock. Other chip makers 
were strong, including Micron Technology, up 3/4 to 40 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Kemper tumbled 6 3/8 to 42 1/4 after Kemper and Conseco Inc. said Sunday 
that they had mutually agreed to end a $2.4-billion merger agreement. Conseco 
surged 3 to 40 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil stocks ended mixed after the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries 
said it was considering a freeze on current output levels. 
</P>
<P>
 * Dow component Chevron rose 1 1/8 to 43 3/4 after First Boston upgraded the 
stock to "buy" from "hold." Texaco gained 1/4 to 61 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chiron surged 2 to 80 1/4 in Nasdaq trading after Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss drug 
company, confirmed that it will acquire a 49.9% stake in Chiron. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stock markets were mixed. Tokyo's 225-share Nikkei average ended down 
180.84 points at 19,121.72. Frankfurt's DAX average closed up 5.05 points at 
2,105.28, and London's Financial Times average closed down 10 points at 3,121. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, the dollar was mixed, closing in New York at 1.557 German marks, up 
from 1.555 marks Friday. It also ended at 98.36 Japanese yen, down from 98.53.

NASDAQ OFFERS CHANGES ON SMALL TRADES; WALL STREET: REVISIONS TO ITS N-PROVE 
SYSTEM FOLLOW DISCLOSURE OF MULTIPLE INVESTIGATIONS OF THE MARKET. SEC APPROVAL 
IS NEEDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Under pressure from regulators, the National Assn. of Securities Dealers 
proposed new rules Monday that would give small investors more of a chance to 
buy and sell Nasdaq stocks at prices better than those quoted by dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposals come in the form of changes to the NASD's longstanding plan for 
a new system, known as N-Prove, to handle orders of up to 1,000 shares. Earlier 
versions of the plan had been heavily criticized by some regulators and 
investors' advocates as giving small investors less overall protection than the 
current system, known as SOES, for "small order execution system." 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, some of those critics lauded the latest proposal as a significant 
improvement, but they said it still appears to contain serious flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost among them is that N-Prove would still allow a delay of up to 
slightly more than 15 seconds in the execution of small buy or sell orders. 
Although that delay is shorter than originally proposed for N-Prove, critics 
note that prices can change substantially in 15 seconds in a rapidly moving 
market. Under SOES, there is no delay. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed new system will go into effect only if approved by the Securities 
and Exchange Commission. The proposed changes follow disclosure of multiple 
investigations of Nasdaq, including a Justice Department inquiry into possible 
price fixing by Nasdaq dealers and a probe by the SEC. The SEC inquiry was 
announced following publication of an investigative series in The Times on ways 
Nasdaq works to the disadvantage of small investors. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes proposed Monday are aimed at fixing one longstanding problem: 
Small investor limit orders -- that is, orders to buy or sell shares only at a 
specified price -- often go unfilled on Nasdaq, while market makers continue to 
trade at prices better for themselves and worse for customers. 
</P>
<P>
 (Market makers are the dealers who stand ready to buy or sell specific Nasdaq 
stocks at publicly quoted prices. Nasdaq is an electronically linked network of 
such dealers, unlike the New York and other stock exchanges, where floor 
trading in a specific stock is concentrated in the hands of a single 
"specialist" firm that matches orders to buy and sell.)  
</P>
<P>
 The major features of the new proposal include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Customers who place orders to buy or sell stock at the prevailing market 
price would automatically get a chance at any limit orders pending in the 
N-Prove computer at prices better than those offered by the stock's market 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if market makers are willing to buy a stock from the public at 
$20 and sell it at $20.25, investors will automatically get a chance to buy the 
stock at a price in between -- say $20.125 -- if another customer has put in a 
limit order indicating that he is willing to sell at that price. This way, both 
customers benefit -- the one who placed the limit order to sell and the 
customer who put in an ordinary market order to buy at the prevailing price. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, the two customers would trade with each other unless a market maker 
intervened within 15 seconds and filled the market order at a price at least 
$0.0625 (or 1/16th) better than the limit order price. In that case, the 
customer placing the ordinary order would benefit from a somewhat lower price, 
but the limit order would sit unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
 * For the first time, Nasdaq would make public the information on customer 
limit orders through private services that provide moment-by-moment data on the 
Nasdaq market. However, only limit orders entered into N-Prove -- and of those, 
only ones at prices between the buy and sell prices quoted by dealers -- would 
be disclosed. The NASD says this would increase the chance that limit orders 
will be filled. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bowing to pressure from the SEC, the NASD agreed to extend its ban on market 
makers trading for their own accounts ahead of customers' orders. So-called 
trading ahead, whereby dealers make trades for themselves at advantageous 
prices while their customers' orders sit unfilled, has long been banned on 
other exchanges. But until earlier this year, it was permitted on Nasdaq. The 
new proposal would extend a partial ban that went into effect in June. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeffrey P. Ricker, a San Francisco-based consultant to institutional investors 
who has been critical of earlier proposed N-Prove rules, called the changes "an 
order of magnitude better than the original proposal." 
</P>
<P>
 But he and other critics noted that the only limit orders that would go into 
N-Prove are limit orders of 1,000 shares or less, essentially only those put in 
by other small investors. The much larger number of orders put in by big 
customers, such as institutions, would not be in the system, so small investors 
most likely would never know about them, much less get a chance to trade at the 
better prices offered by the big investors. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, small investors' limit orders would not automatically go into 
N-Prove. They would have to ask their brokers to use the system, and there is 
no obligation for brokerage firms to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Ricker said brokerage firms may have strong incentives not to want to put such 
orders into N-Prove. For example, putting a limit order in the system could 
interfere with the arrangements under which brokerages receive payment from 
market makers in exchange for sending them all or most of their Nasdaq orders 
for execution.

YOUR MONEY; SPOTLIGHT ON TAXES; FACTS ABOUT CASUALTY LOSSES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Kathy Kristof 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 THE RULES: You get a tax deduction for unreimbursed losses from sudden, 
unusual and unexpected events, such as fires, floods, earthquakes and 
tornadoes.  
</P>
<P>
 THE LIMITATIONS: The deductible portion of the loss is the amount that exceeds 
10% of your adjusted gross income plus $100 per casualty.In other words, if you 
earn $50,000, you must subtract $5,100 from your unreimbursed loss. You can 
deduct the result.  
</P>
<P>
 THE TRICKS: To determine your total loss you must either get appraisals of the 
property's value, or you must establish the cost of repairing the damage. If 
the decline in value or the cost of repair exceeds the amount you paid for the 
property, you can deduct the lesser of the two. 
</P>
<P>
 THE CAVEATS: Casualty losses are widely believed to be audit triggers, 
singling out your return for special scrutiny by the IRS. This shouldn't 
discourage you from claiming a legitimate loss. But you should be sure to 
maintain particularly clear and detailed tax records in any year that you claim 
a casualty loss. Kathy Kristof

 OPEC Agrees to Freeze Output: The Organization of Petroleum Exporting 
Countries has agreed to cap its current oil production through the end of 1995 
in a bid to boost sagging world oil prices. The decision was unanimous, an OPEC 
source said.The current oil output ceiling is 24.52 million barrels a day. 
Before the announcement, cargoes of the global benchmark crude for January 
loading were offered at $17 a barrel in Asia trading. While oil prices rose in 
Asia as it became clear OPEC members were moving toward an agreement on a 
one-year cap, analysts in New York were skeptical that the move would have much 
impact on prices. January crude oil contracts ended a penny higher at $17.56 on 
the New York Merc after rising as high as $17.95 in earlier trading.

 Biotech Deal Worth $2.1 Billion: Swiss drug and chemical company Ciba-Geigy 
Ltd. is moving big into biotech with an announcement that it will buy 49.9% of 
California's Chiron Corp. for $2.1 billion. That's a high price, analysts say, 
but perhaps justified, because the deal gives each company assets it needs to 
stay profitable.Ciba, whose biggest-selling drugs are older and facing 
competition, gets access to Chiron's rich collection of experimental new drugs 
and medical products. Chiron gets a secure supply of cash to conduct research 
and access to Ciba's strong manufacturing and marketing forces. Ciba will pay 
Chiron's stockholders $117 per share for about 35% of Chiron's outstanding 
stock -- double the market price for Chiron before rumors of the deal surfaced 
earlier this month.

 Garamendi Seeks to End Rebate Delay: Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi 
said he asked the California Supreme Court to reverse a lower-court ruling 
delaying payment of $120 million in Proposition 103 rebates to policyholders of 
20th Century Industries. The high court on Aug. 18 rejected Woodland 
Hills-based 20th Century's challenge to Garamendi's regulations for 
implementing the 1988 insurance rate-cutting initiative.But 20th Century later 
obtained a stay of the ruling in Los Angeles Superior Court pending the 
company's planned appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court. Garamendi argues that the 
Superior Court lacks the authority to stay the high court's order. Garamendi 
also said he plans to announce today the specific rollback obligations of an 
additional 28 companies under Proposition 103. His original rollback order in 
October, 1991, listed only 14 insurers, including 20th Century.

FTC FINDS MORE THAN A GRAM OF FALLACY IN ADS BY HAAGEN-DAZS

 Low-fat Haagen-Dazs? In several instances, it really was too good to be true, 
the Federal Trade Commission says. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen-Dazs Co., which built its reputation on rich, creamy frozen desserts, 
agreed Monday to settle FTC charges that it made false and misleading 
statements about its frozen yogurt products.The company, based in Teaneck, 
N.J., advertised its frozen yogurt products last year as "low fat" and "98 
percent fat free." It also said its frozen yogurt bars contained only 100 
calories and one gram of fat. 
</P>
<P>
 The FTC said seven of the company's nine frozen yogurt flavors were not 
low-fat -- defined by the Food and Drug Administration as having three grams of 
fat or less. Some of them had as many as 12 grams of fat per serving, the 
agency said. And three of its eight flavors of frozen yogurt bars -- cherry 
chocolate fudge, vanilla chocolate crunch and coffee chocolate crunch -- 
contained as many as 230 calories per serving, not the 100 calories the ads 
claimed. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the settlement, Haagen-Dazs admitted no wrongdoing but said it will 
not run misleading ads again. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen-Dazs is not the first company to be hit by an FTC complaint of 
misleading advertising. Islay Klondike's Klondike ice cream bars also had 
problems with low-fat and calorie claims. And Stouffer Food Corp. had a run-in 
with the agency last month over its low-sodium claims. Both lost. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a new food labeling law that went into effect last spring, the FDA 
defines terms such as low - fat and reduced - calorie and makes sure that the 
nutritional information on food packages is correct. But the FTC makes sure 
advertising claims about food are not misleading.

USAIR MEDIA BLITZ DEFENDS CARRIER SAFETY; AIRLINES: THE ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN IS 
A BID TO 'VALIDATE OUR OPERATIONS' IN THE WAKE OF SEPTEMBER'S DEADLY CRASH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Troubled USAir Group Inc. launched a three-day media blitz Monday, trying to 
convince the public that its operations are safe even as new concerns surfaced 
about a deadly September crash near Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir ran a letter to travelers in about 40 newspaper advertisements, and 
other ads will be published today and Wednesday, a spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we are safe, but we want to say to the public that we want you to 
know that too, so we're taking some extraordinary measures to validate our 
operations," spokeswoman Andrea Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 The full-page letter that ran in The Times and other major newspapers told of 
an independent audit of the airline's safety operations to be conducted by PRC 
Aviation of Tucson. It also announced that retired Gen. Robert Oaks, a former 
commander of U.S. Air Force operations in Europe, will oversee USAir's air and 
ground safety operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "In closing, let me say that we will not rest until each and every member of 
the flying public shares in the certainty of our commitment to be the safest of 
airlines," said the letter signed by Chairman Seth Schofield. 
</P>
<P>
 The safety record of Arlington, Va.-based USAir has been under scrutiny since 
the crash near Pittsburgh that killed 132 people. 
</P>
<P>
 Court papers that surfaced over the weekend contend several passengers coming 
off the plane on the first leg of the fatal flight reported unusual sounds. 
USAir said a chief mechanic asked the cockpit crew about the passenger reports 
but that the crew told him it had no problems with the plane. 
</P>
<P>
 "Unless and until a cause is identified for Flight 427, we will continue to be 
the subject of media speculation and public concern on our safety record," 
Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 Butler said USAir sent information packets to more than 21,000 corporate 
clients and travel agents last week disputing a recent New York Times report 
that cited safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry and travel experts said USAir's traffic has suffered due to the 
September crash. Including that accident, the airline has experienced five 
fatal crashes in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think the effects are more from the lingering coverage suggesting we've 
cut corners, and nothing could be further from the truth there," Butler said. 
</P>
<P>
 She said advance bookings indicate passenger traffic will return to normal by 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 But industry experts were skeptical that traffic will return that soon to 
USAir, especially because the period after the winter holidays is the slowest 
time of year for air travel. 
</P>
<P>
 USAir's stock closed 25 cents higher at $4.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
That contrasts with its 52-week high of $15.375.

THE ONSLAUGHT OF EXECUTIVE BURNOUT; SURVEY SHOWS 65% FEEL OVERWORKED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Overworked executives fear they are burning out faster than ever in the era of 
corporate downsizing, but those who actually get fired may be getting the 
better deal, according to two new surveys. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly three of four executives believe the threat of burnout is greater now 
than it was 20 years ago, said a survey released Monday by Challenger Gray & 
Christmas Inc., an international outplacement firm based in Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
 A majority of those polled said managers are working too many hours (65%), are 
physically exhausted by day's end (64%) and bring too much work home (60%). 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, a 1982 survey showed only 39% believed managers were working 
too hard. 
</P>
<P>
 But the solution to burnout may be the very thing executives fear -- job 
hunting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's face it, the pressure of proving yourself in a new environment with new 
people and new challenges makes you better," says James Challenger, president 
of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested executives age 45 should change jobs every four to five years. 
</P>
<P>
 However, for those executives whose decision to seek a new job has been made 
for them, parting has not been such sweet sorrow -- at least for their wallets. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, two-thirds of 575 terminated executives said they believed their 
severance packages were fair, said a survey by Lee Hecht Harrison, a New 
York-based outplacement consulting firm. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given most people's mixed emotions after losing a job, we did not expect that 
so many would be satisfied with the severance their former employers provided," 
said Steve Harrison, president of the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 He said fired executives received an average of 28 weeks of severance pay, 
consistent with four years ago. Severance benefits seem to have become 
institutionalized, even as many organizations are cutting costs and trimming 
staff, he said.

PEOPLE: APPLE'S LITIGATION DIRECTOR QUITS TO TAKE GAY RIGHTS POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DONNA K. H. WALTERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elizabeth Birch, director of litigation for Apple Computer Inc., said she will 
leave her post at Apple next month to assume the position of executive director 
of the Human Rights Campaign Fund, the nation's largest political organization 
for gays and lesbians. 
</P>
<P>
 Birch, 38, said she will begin her new job Jan. 6. 
</P>
<P>
 Long active in gay and lesbian groups, Birch has been one of the most 
prominent gays in management in corporate America. She joined Apple in 1989 and 
also served as general counsel at its software company, Claris Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the executive directorship, she said, "This is kind of work where I could 
get up every morning and just love what I do." 
</P>
<P>
 From 1992 until this year Birch was co-chairwoman of the National Gay and 
Lesbian Task Force. "Both jobs I love had gotten too big," she said. "My 
corporate career had blossomed, and my philanthropic work had blossomed as 
well." 
</P>
<P>
 Birch said she recognized that, in the wake of the Republican victory in this 
month's elections, the tasks of gay rights organizations will become more 
difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 "What's the point of making such a step in easy times? I really believe I have 
a set of skills that will be very useful to my community in these times, and I 
want to be there for my community in the hard times," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Human Rights Campaign Fund uses its resources to support political 
candidates, to organize and lobby for gay rights. 
</P>
<P>
 Birch anticipates "formidable opposition from the ultra-right," which 
generally and often vociferously disapproves of the gay rights agenda. 
</P>
<P>
 "This country sometimes stumbles over itself and makes mistakes . . . but, 
ultimately, at the base, these values of fairness and non-discrimination win 
out. (They) are at the heart of the Constitution and at the heart of what 
Americans want and believe should exist." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting that the Washington-based group is an $8-million organization, she said 
her new job will give her responsibilities akin to those of a company chief 
executive. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really feel it's very exciting, to take all my legal and corporate skills 
and bring them to bear in the 26th year of this civil rights movement," she 
said. "Some professionalism has occurred (in the gay rights movement), but now 
is the time to use marketing and the cutting-edge tools of business."

 Goldman Sachs Holiday Bonuses Shrink: Goldman, Sachs & Co., the most affluent 
firm on Wall Street, is giving relatively paltry bonuses to most employees this 
year, a sure sign of a grim holiday season in the financial world. In an 
internal memo, Goldman said it will pay year-end bonuses equal to 8% of salary 
for most of its 9,000 employees who aren't partners and earn most of their pay 
from salary.Goldman told employees in the memo that the move was prompted by 
sharply lower profits this year. Wall Street sources estimate Goldman's 
earnings are down 80% from 1993's record $2.3 billion, amid a bond market 
downturn akin to the 1987 crash in stocks. In 1993, Goldman paid bonuses of 
30%. For the prior three years, they averaged 23%.

 Recycling Industry Study Shows Big California Growth: Businesses that collect 
and recycle everything from newspapers to old wine barrels have grown from just 
a handful seven years ago, to 1,787 companies currently, with more than 3,000 
facilities throughout the state, according to a survey by Californians Against 
Waste, a Sacramento-based environmental foundation. Recycling revenue in Los 
Angeles County alone topped $600 million in 1993, with estimated revenue of 
$1.5 billion to $2 billion statewide last year. "Remarkably, even at the height 
of California's recession, new companies were started up or existing facilities 
were expanded and out-of-state manufacturers were attracted to the state," said 
Lance M. King, community outreach director for the group.

 Hondo Oil Losses Slow, Lonrho Debt Restructured: The Roswell, N.M.-based 
company run by former Arco Chairman Robert O. Anderson said its loss from 
continuing operations for the fiscal year ended Sept. 30 slowed to $8 million, 
or 62 cents a share, from $8.7 million, or 67 cents, a year earlier. The 
company also said that Lonrho, its principal lender, had agreed to extend until 
Oct. 1, 1996, the maturity of its $78 million in loans to Hondo. Speculation 
circulated that Lonrho would sell its interest in Hondo after the recent ouster 
of Lonrho CEO Roland W. Rowland.

ROLLS TO BUY JET ENGINE RIVAL ALLISON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 British jet engine maker Rolls-Royce will buy competitor Allison Engine Co. 
for $525 million, the companies announced Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 The purchase will allow Rolls-Royce to provide engines to half the markets for 
military aircraft in the Western World, said John W. Sandford, managing 
director of Rolls' aerospace group. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the deal, Indianapolis-based Allison, which employs 4,300 people in 
three Indiana plants, will keep its name. It would be the second sale of 
Allison in just over a year. General Motors sold the company last fall for $300 
million to Clayton, Dubilier & Rice, a New York investment firm, and a group of 
Allison managers.

CBS, NBC TO SWAP TV STATIONS, OTHER ASSETS IN FOUR CITIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In another rearrangement of the broadcasting landscape, CBS Inc. and NBC said 
Monday that they have agreed to swap several TV stations and other assets in 
four major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal gives National Broadcasting Co. a powerful station in Philadelphia, 
the nation's fourth-largest market, where it recently lost its affiliate to 
CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS gets stations in Denver and Salt Lake City, a stronger broadcast tower and 
a place on the dial for its Miami station. All three stations will become part 
of a joint venture CBS agreed to create with Westinghouse Broadcasting Co. in 
July. Westinghouse will own 51% of that venture, while CBS will own 49%. The 
CBS-Westinghouse venture plans to buy more stations and make them affiliates of 
the CBS Television Network, assuring that the CBS program lineup will reach a 
wider audience. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest moves are part of a series of station affiliation changes triggered 
when News Corp.'s Fox Broadcasting division bought a stake in New World 
Communications Group. New World announced plans to switch the affiliation of 
its 12 stations to the Fox Network from CBS, NBC and ABC. That sent the three 
major networks scrambling to find new affiliates. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest deal, CBS is giving NBC its WCAU station in Philadelphia. That 
station was CBS' first network affiliate, on board since 1948. In exchange for 
its Philadelphia station, CBS will get NBC's Denver station, KCNC, along with 
$30 million in cash and a stronger position in the Miami market for the station 
CBS owns there, WCIX. NBC's new affiliate in Denver will be KUSA, owned by 
Gannett Co.

COMPANY TOWN; 'SWAN' STICKS ITS NECK OUT BUT STILL GETS THE AX; FILM: POOR BOX 
OFFICE OPENING RESURRECTS AGE-OLD QUESTION: CAN AN ANIMATED MOVIE BE A HIT IF 
IT ISN'T MADE BY DISNEY? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES BATES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite favorable reviews from many critics, New Line Cinema's "The Swan 
Princess" was being viewed by Hollywood on Monday as something of a swan dive. 
</P>
<P>
 The film's lethargic domestic box office opening of $2.4 million has again 
raised an age-old question in Hollywood: Can a full-length animated movie be a 
hit if it isn't made by Walt Disney Co.? 
</P>
<P>
 The experience of "The Swan Princess," made by former Disney animators, is 
especially relevant these days with Hollywood sinking hundreds of millions of 
dollars into what may soon look like an animation binge to the moviegoing 
public. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no question Disney has taken animation to a whole new level. If you 
argue that, you come from another planet. But there's definitely room for 
animation from other places than Disney," said Tom Sherak, senior executive 
vice president at 20th Century Fox. 
</P>
<P>
 Fox, which Wednesday enters the fray with its own live action-animated "The 
Pagemaster," starring Macaulay Culkin, is investing $100 million in a new 
animation division -- including a new studio in Arizona -- that will release an 
animated film every 18 months in a direct challenge to Disney's dominance. 
</P>
<P>
 Universal has long been active through its association with Steven Spielberg. 
Warner Bros. has a feature animation department. The new studio planned by 
former Disney studio chief Jeffrey Katzenberg, music mogul David Geffen and 
Spielberg expects animation to be a cornerstone of the business. 
</P>
<P>
 The attraction stems partly from favorable economics. Animated films usually 
cost less to make than big star-driven movies, and they can attract corporate 
sponsors that boost exposure at marketing time. "The Swan Princess," for 
example, marked steakhouse Sizzler's first tie-in to an animated film. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, animated films often sell well on videocassette, which are highly 
profitable in per-unit terms. 
</P>
<P>
 All this means that the threshold for making a profit is usually lower than in 
live action and studios can retain more of that profit. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Swan Princess," which had a $35-million production and marketing budget, 
is based on the German fairy tale that is the basis of the "Swan Lake" ballet. 
Producing the film and picking up the costs was Nest Entertainment, working 
with former Disney animator Richard Rich. Turner Broadcasting's New Line unit 
released the film on a straight distribution deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood executives say the case of "The Swan Princess" shows that such 
efforts aren't without risk and that it is difficult to replicate Disney's 
success without the label, even when a film tries to get some of the look and 
feel of a Disney film. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looked like a Disney movie, but it wasn't," one rival executive said. "And 
the public is mindful of that." 
</P>
<P>
 New Line isn't giving up. Mitch Goldman, head of marketing and distribution, 
said the company, while disappointed at the box office results, believes the 
film will play through the holidays on strong word of mouth. "This isn't a 
three-day movie," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the fact remains that no other studio has come up with anything 
approaching the blockbuster success of Disney's "The Lion King," "Aladdin," 
"Beauty and the Beast" or "The Little Mermaid." Only Universal -- with its 
Fievel movies and "The Land Before Time" with Spielberg -- has enjoyed some 
success. 
</P>
<P>
 Hollywood executives cited a number of reasons why they think "Swan Princess" 
didn't open well, starting with the re-release by Disney of the animated 
blockbuster "The Lion King." 
</P>
<P>
 Also working against the film is the crowded market of family movies, 
including Disney's "The Santa Clause" and Fox's "Miracle on 34th Street," along 
with such long-awaited films as Paramount's "Star Trek: Generations." 
</P>
<P>
 The executives said another strike against the movie is the fact that it is 
not targeted to adults as well as children. Indeed, Disney said a good chunk of 
the $5.5 million that "The Lion King" did at the box office last weekend in 
re-release came from single people who had not seen the movie over the summer.

YOUR MONEY; SPOTLIGHT ON TAXES; UNCLE SAM HAS MADE ROOM FOR A FEW MORE ON THE 
AUDIT HOT SEAT; SCRUTINY: NEW PROGRAMS TARGET INDUSTRIES LIKELY TO SHUN 
EMPLOYMENT TAXES, THOSE HEAVY ON CASH.

 Architects, art dealers, beauticians, bail bondsmen, morticians and ministers 
beware. You are now among about 80 industry groups targeted in the Internal 
Revenue Service's most feared audit program: the Market Segment Specialization 
Program, for which specially trained IRS agents scrutinize every line of your 
tax return to ferret out gaffes.  
</P>
<P>
 To make matters worse, the agency also just launched an auditing initiative 
called economic reality, an expanded and improved method of nabbing people who 
understate their incomes. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the MSSP and economic reality programs focus on groups that can receive a 
large portion of their income in cash or trade, as well as industries that may 
be failing to pay employment taxes for their workers. That's because the agency 
suspects that a large portion of the nation's "tax gap" -- a yawning 
$100-billion difference between what the IRS believes is owed and what's 
actually paid each year -- can be attributed to people who are hiding income or 
misstating employment arrangements in an effort to escape federal and state 
income taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 Who is in the hot seat? 
</P>
<P>
 People who receive tips, such as those who wash and detail cars; barbers and 
beauticians; pizza drivers, and waiters and waitresses. Companies that do a 
large portion of their business in cash, such as grocery stores, liquor stores, 
gas stations, pizza parlors, parking lots, pawn shops, cart vendors and 
coin-operated laundries are also being scrutinized for non-reported income. And 
industries that use large numbers of independent contractors, ranging from 
garment manufacturers to rest homes to building contractors, are facing careful 
review of their employment arrangements.  
</P>
<P>
 The IRS is also checking to see if employees are being mis-categorized as 
"independent contractors" so companies can avoid paying Social Security, 
Medicare and unemployment taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 When these folks get audited, they'll also find that the IRS is not focusing 
completely on their tax returns. Through the wonders of computer matching, IRS 
agents can find out if you own a boat, a plane or a luxury car. They can 
determine the size of your mortgage. And they can subpoena your bank records to 
find out just how much money is going in and out of your accounts, says Bob 
Kamman, a Phoenix tax accountant. 
</P>
<P>
 If your lifestyle appears pricey given your means, the agent will ask you how 
you're coming up with all that money. Unless you've received an inheritance, 
life insurance payout or are getting regular gifts from well-heeled relatives, 
you're in trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In some cases, the agent will actually calculate new income figures for you 
that are based on your lifestyle rather than what you're reporting. And the IRS 
will bill you for unpaid tax on the difference between its income projections 
and yours. 
</P>
<P>
 Taxpayers who are found to have large amounts of unreported income are also 
subject to civil and criminal penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 On the bright side, the IRS is now so focused on taxpayers it considers likely 
to cheat that the chances of anyone else getting audited become slimmer every 
day. Currently, the IRS audits a mere 0.7% of the nation's taxpayers, says 
Martin J. Horwitz, a Cincinnati attorney and author of "Survive Your IRS 
Crisis."  
</P>
<P>
 Still, even innocent and unremarkable taxpayers can get caught up in an IRS 
exam, if they load their return with so-called audit triggers. While the IRS 
keeps its list of triggers close to the vest, tax professionals say they boil 
down to a handful of unusual itemized deductions, including casualty losses, 
home office deductions, exceptionally large charitable contributions and 
contributions of property rather than cash. 
</P>
<P>
 Small-business owners are also prime targets for audits because the IRS 
suspects that some entrepreneurs run their personal expenses through the 
company and put company income in their pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 While you're certainly not going to shutter your business just to avoid an IRS 
audit, tax professionals suggest that you take some steps to protect yourself 
if you're in a high-risk category or if you are claiming targeted deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For example, keep meticulous records of your charitable contributions. If you 
give anything of great value, make sure you get a receipt or acknowledgment 
from the charity. 
</P>
<P>
 Anyone who claims casualty losses should be prepared to present the IRS with 
pictures, videos or detailed listings -- preferably with purchase receipts -- 
of all the items they lost. You'll also need to present insurance estimates of 
the damage, receipts for completed work and documentation for any 
reimbursements you may have received. 
</P>
<P>
 If you are claiming home office deductions, you should know that the IRS won a 
Supreme Court case last year that severely narrowed the criteria for claiming 
these deductions. In addition, the value of these deductions are frequently so 
small that many tax accountants suggest you think twice before bothering to 
claim them. The value of the deduction is often not worth the time and cost of 
trying to defend it in an audit, says Philip J. Holthouse, partner at Holthouse 
Carlin & Van Trigt in Los Angeles.

<P>
 The IRS is targeting 66 industry groups for its most feared audit program, the 
so-called Market Segment Specialization Program, which has specially trained 
IRS agents scrutinize returns of companies and individuals working in specific 
industries. 
</P>
<P>
 These exhaustive and detailed audits are aimed at getting the government "more 
bang for its auditing buck." Translation: If you're singled out in a MSSP 
audit, there's a better-than-average chance that you'll face a bill for back 
taxes and penalties when it's done. 
</P>
<P>
 What is targeted? The IRS list follows. The agency has audit technique guides 
available on about half of these targeted groups and the rest will follow. 
Audit teams don't generally go into full swing until the audit technique 
guidelines are published.

YOUR MONEY; SPOTLIGHT ON TAXES; HANDLE CAPITAL GAINS, LOSSES WITH CARE; 
INVESTMENT: UNREALIZED LOSSES MAY PROVIDE SOME TAX-PLANNING OPPORTUNITIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in nearly a decade, even the savviest investors are looking 
at portfolios freckled with unrealized losses. That provides some modest 
tax-planning opportunities, particularly for high-end taxpayers in top 
brackets, tax experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 However, today's decidedly mixed investment environment also has created some 
pitfalls that could cause the unwary to pay too much tax to Uncle Sam. 
</P>
<P>
 What do U.S. investors need to know to maximize their tax savings without 
minimizing their investment income? 
</P>
<P>
 Capital gains: For mutual fund investors, the biggest surprise of the season 
is likely to be that you've earned capital gains even though your fund's net 
asset value may have dropped in price, says Harvey Gettleson, partner at the 
national accounting firm of Ernst & Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Impossible? Hardly. Fund managers have been selling during market upticks and 
locking in gains. But some of the shares still held in fund portfolios have 
dropped in value, paring stated net asset values. Fund managers won't sell 
these down-and-out shares unless they think the company's prospects have dimmed 
and the stock is unlikely to climb again in the near future. 
</P>
<P>
 The result: You can have unrealized capital losses but realized -- that's 
taxable -- capital gains. 
</P>
<P>
 Capital losses: Even if you lost a fortune on paper, you can't claim the 
losses on your tax return until you "recognize" them by selling the offending 
security. 
</P>
<P>
 Capital losses must first be used to offset any capital gains earned in the 
same year. If you have no capital gains -- or your capital losses exceed your 
capital gains -- you can use up to $3,000 in capital losses per year to offset 
any other income. (It's worth mentioning that you don't lose unused capital 
losses. They're carried forward into future tax years, so there's no reason to 
delay taking losses if you're convinced that this is the right time to sell.) 
</P>
<P>
 As unpleasant as they may seem, capital losses can be valuable at tax time, 
particularly for high-income taxpayers who not only get a deduction, but can 
also use them to limit personal exemption and itemized deduction phase-outs, 
says Philip J. Holthouse, partner at Holthouse Carlin & Van Trigt in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 The formula gets complex, but in effect, a $3,000 loss that would save a 
middle-income family of four $840 in tax would save an identical four-member 
family a tidy $1,183 if it was in the 36% bracket. (See box above.) 
</P>
<P>
 Wash sales: Tempted to trigger a capital loss and just buy back the stock 
later? If you repurchase the same shares within 30 days, you're subject to 
so-called wash-sale rules that bar you from recognizing the capital loss, 
Gettleson says. If you wait 31 days, you can repurchase the same shares without 
triggering a tax problem. But, of course, you may have hurt your investment 
prospects by buying or selling at the wrong time. 
</P>
<P>
 It's far easier to trigger capital losses by selling devalued bonds, Holthouse 
notes. That's because it's easy to find two bonds that have similar investment 
characteristics but are not identical for tax purposes. You could sell $500 in 
7% 10-year Treasuries today and buy $500 in 7.5% 10-year Treasuries tomorrow 
and not trigger wash-sale problems, for example. Even though the issuer and 
maturity dates are the same, the interest rate is different, making the 
investments distinct, Holthouse adds. 
</P>
<P>
 Investment interest expenses: Rules determining how to handle investment 
interest expenses got more restrictive in 1993, says Ken Anderson, partner at 
Arthur Andersen & Co. in Los Angeles. In the past, you could subtract these 
expenses from capital gains. But now these costs can be used only to reduce 
investment income -- dividends and interest. Also make sure you pay the debt in 
1994 if you want to claim it as a 1994 deduction. 
</P>
<P>
 Appreciated stock: Never has there been a better time to give your favorite 
charity stock rather than cash. That's because a hefty capital gain can throw 
you into a lofty tax bracket or leave you facing the onerous alternative 
minimum tax. If you give the stock to charity, you can get a deduction for the 
full market value. And nobody has to pay the capital gain. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider Sally Givalot, a hypothetical taxpayer who wants to give $1,000 to 
her favorite charity. She also happens to have 100 shares of stock that she 
bought for $1 per share in 1987. This stock now is selling for $10 per share, 
or $1,000. If she sells the stock and gives the proceeds to charity, she gets a 
$1,000 tax deduction, worth $310, assuming she's in the 31% bracket. But she 
also triggers a $900 capital gain, which costs $252 (28%) in federal tax. Net 
tax benefit: $58. 
</P>
<P>
 If, on the other hand, she gives the stock directly to the charity, she gets 
the $310 tax savings and doesn't have to pay tax on the unrealized capital 
gain. Nonprofit organizations have become increasingly attuned to this method 
of gift giving, Holthouse says. Many can give Capital Losses Why does a 
high-income taxpayer get more bang from a capital loss buck? 
</P>
<P>
 Three reasons: 
</P>
<P>
 * The higher the tax bracket, the bigger the write-off value. If you're in the 
36% tax bracket, a $3,000 deduction saves $1,080 in tax. If you're in the 28% 
bracket, the same deduction saves just $840. 
</P>
<P>
 * Personal exemption phase-outs. The government's recent efforts to soak the 
rich have resulted in some fairly convoluted "phase-outs" of standard tax 
breaks. The first one affects personal exemptions -- the $2,450 deduction you 
take for each dependent member of your family. 
</P>
<P>
 The formula is complex, but the result is this: A family of four would 
normally be able to reduce its adjusted gross income by $9,800 for personal 
exemptions. But if the family earned $200,000 annually, its personal exemptions 
would be reduced to $7,252. 
</P>
<P>
 If it is able to reduce its income by taking a $3,000 capital loss, the 
personal exemption phase-out is also reduced. The end result: The value of its 
personal exemptions rises by $196 to $7,448, which saves it roughly $70 in tax. 
</P>
<P>
 * Deduction phase-outs. Families with an adjusted gross income exceeding 
$111,800 also lose part of their itemized deductions -- the write-offs for home 
mortgage expenses, property taxes, medical and dental costs and unreimbursed 
business expenditures. Simply put, for every $1,000 more than $111,800 you 
earn, you lose $30 in these deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you reduce your adjusted gross income, you save part of your itemized 
deductions. A $3,000 capital loss would save this high-income family $90 in 
itemized deductions.

YOUR MONEY; SPOTLIGHT ON TAXES; SIX THINGS YOU CAN DO TO TRIM YOUR TAXES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KATHY M. KRISTOF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When it comes to tax planning, timing is everything.  
</P>
<P>
 If you can push deductible expenses forward and taxable income back, you can 
delay paying taxes on part of your earnings and save yourself hundreds of 
dollars in 1994 income taxes.  
</P>
<P>
 Of course, eventually, income deferrals will catch up to you and you'll have 
to pay the tax. But meanwhile you can earn interest on it and, if you can 
believe the rhetoric coming out of Washington these days, you may pay tax at 
lower rates in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 In any event, now as the holidays approach, 'tis the season to accelerate 
deductions, defer income and sidestep those year-end pitfalls that can cost you 
at tax time. What can you do? Give, bundle up and save -- among other things. 
</P>
<P>
 * Pay taxes and mortgage early. Property and state taxes that aren't due until 
March or April can be paid in December for a 1994 deduction. You can also make 
your January mortgage payment in December and get an extra month of mortgage 
interest deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Give: Knock the dust off the '60s relics you have in the garage or attic and 
call a local charity. Organizations ranging from the California Council for the 
Blind to the Vietnam Veterans of America and St. Vincent De Paul seek usable 
clothing, furniture and appliances. Many local libraries would love your old 
books, too. You get a deduction for the fair market value of any old items you 
give to a qualified nonprofit, but be sure to get a receipt.  
</P>
<P>
 If you're giving away items worth more than $500, you'll need to fill out a 
form stating what you gave and how you estimated the value. If you're giving 
items worth $5,000 or more, you'll need an appraisal, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, if you've been considering making cash donations, do it before 
year-end. But, if you've got stock that's appreciated in value, you may want to 
consider giving the stock instead. The benefit: The shares may have only cost 
you a few bucks when you bought them years ago, but you get a deduction 
equivalent to today's fair market value. Better still, by giving the stock 
directly, you don't have to pay capital gains taxes on the appreciation. Be 
quick. The charity has to receive the stock -- or be registered as the share 
owner of record -- by Dec. 31 if you want the deduction this year. 
</P>
<P>
 * Bundle up: You can get tax deductions for unreimbursed business expenses and 
medical costs, but only if these expenditures amount to more than set 
percentages of your income. "Miscellaneous" deductions, such as business 
expenses, professional dues and subscription costs for newspapers and magazines 
needed for work, are only deductible after they exceed 2% of your adjusted 
gross income. Medical costs can be written off once they exceed 7.5% of your 
AGI. As a result, most taxpayers should try to "bundle" these expenses by 
pushing them into just one year. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if this has been a big year for medical bills and you're 
approaching the 7.5% threshold, schedule any additional necessary appointments 
-- eye exams, physicals, check-ups -- before year-end. That way, you have a 
chance at the medical expense deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 * Save: If your employer offers a 401(k) plan, you should be contributing to 
it at the maximum levels possible. That's because 401(k) contributions are 
taken out of your pay before tax. As far as Uncle Sam is concerned, you never 
earned the money.  
</P>
<P>
 The contributions reduce your taxable income, tax obligations and make it 
easier to reach deduction thresholds for casualty losses, medical expenses and 
miscellaneous itemized deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 Economically speaking, 401(k) plans are a good deal too. If your employer 
matches contributions, your retirement savings will grow at a rapid clip, even 
in the sorriest investment environments. And some plans allow you to borrow up 
to half of your account value without tax penalty, so you may not even lose 
access to your cash. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1994, the maximum allowable 401(k) contribution is $9,240. That 
contribution will save a tidy $2,864 in tax for somebody in the 31% bracket. 
</P>
<P>
 If your employer doesn't offer a company pension or 401(k), you can contribute 
up to $2,000 per year to a tax-deductible Individual Retirement Account. And, 
if you're self-employed, you can put up to $30,000 of your self-employment 
income into a Keogh plan.  
</P>
<P>
 * Avoid mutual funds. Mutual funds are a great way to invest, but not in 
November and December. This is the time of year that fund companies distribute 
capital gains and dividends to shareholders. If you're a new investor, these 
distributions are a return of your principal, not investment earnings. But

 Consumers who buy new mutual fund shares before the end of the year could find 
themselves in a disagreeable situation come April 15. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because of the capital gains taxes shareholders have to pay on 
dividends and other distributions mutual funds make.Since most mutual funds 
have record dates in December, buying into a mutual fund now can make taxpayers 
liable for a whole years' worth of gains, even though they've only held the 
fund a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 One solution is to check out a fund's record date before buying, and not buy 
when a record date is too near, said John Woerth, a spokesman for Vanguard 
Group, which manages assets of some $130 billion. Another is to buy mutual 
funds like Vanguard's Tax-Managed Fund, which takes into account the tax 
ramifications of a successful mutual fund investment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of funds distribute capital gains at year-end, so wait until after the 
record date to buy," Woerth said. "It doesn't make sense to buy a week before, 
because you can pay capital gains taxes on the whole year's performance even 
though you've only been in the fund for a few days." 
</P>
<P>
 Investors often overlook taxes when seeking high returns from their mutual 
fund, Woerth said. 
</P>
<P>
 "A fund that generates lots of capital gains may not be a top performer when 
adjusted for taxes," he said. "The new thing are funds that are tax-advantaged, 
and that could be the difference between the performance and what investors 
actually get to keep."

YOUR MONEY; SPOTLIGHT ON TAXES; HOW MUCH WILL YOU OWE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some of the key figures for people wishing to estimate how much tax 
they will owe. Note that taxable income is income after exemptions and 
deductions. 
</P>
<P>
 * $38,000: For married people filing jointly, this is the point where the tax 
rate takes its biggest marginal jump, from 15% to 28%. For singles, this occurs 
at $22,700; for unmarried or legally separated people who are heads of 
households, $30,500; for married people filing separately, $19,000. Under those 
levels, you pay 15%. 
</P>
<P>
 * 28%: Maximum federal tax rate on long-term capital gains. There is talk of 
lowering this next year, so take that into consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 * 39.6%: Maximum federal tax rate on wages or dividend or interest income, 
applicable to people with taxable income in excess of $250,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 36%: A 36% rate kicks in for people with taxable income above $140,000 
(married filing jointly) or $115,000 (single). 
</P>
<P>
 * 31%: A 31% rate applies above $91,850 (married) or $55,100 (single). 
</P>
<P>
 * 28%: The effective rate above $38,000 (married) or $22,750 (single). On 
income below that, a 15% rate applies. 
</P>
<P>
 * $9,240: Maximum that an employee can elect to invest in a 401(k) plan in 
1994, up from $8,994 in 1993. Including employer contributions, the ceiling is 
$30,000 or 25% of taxable compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 * $40,000 to $50,000: Income level between which IRA deductions phase out, for 
married people with retirement plan coverage at work. For singles with such 
coverage, IRAs are fully deductible for income below $25,000 and not at all 
deductible above $35,000. 
</P>
<P>
 * 59 1/2: Age below which a 10% penalty may apply on early withdrawals from 
IRAs, 401(k)s, variable annuities and other retirement vehicles.

FLASHBACK; MAYBE THE BEST; IT HAS BEEN 20 YEARS SINCE SANTA ANA VALLEY WON THE 
SECTION'S 3-A CHAMPIONSHIP, WHICH SECURED THE FALCONS A PLACE IN COUNTY PREP 
FOOTBALL HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty years? Could it really be that long? The newspaper clippings turned 
yellow a long time ago, photos are curling up at the edges, pounds have been 
added, hair lost and specifics exaggerated. Memories of Santa Ana Valley's 1974 
Southern Section 3-A championship team remain vivid, even after 20 years of 
standout football tams in Orange County. The passing seasons have seen 
dynasties rise and fall, great players come and go, records set and broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Comparisons are inevitable, of course. Los Alamitos won Friday and extended 
its unbeaten streak to a section record-tying 46 consecutive games. Master Dei, 
Edison, El Toro, Esperanza, Fountain Valley, Servite and Valencia, among 
others, have fielded dominating teams since '74. 
</P>
<P>
 Could any of them have beaten Santa Ana Valley's team? 
</P>
<P>
 It's eminently debatable. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no question the '74 Santa Ana Valley team is one of the county's 
best, however. 
</P>
<P>
 For the record, the Falcons finished 11-1-2, crushing a previously unbeaten 
Colton team in the 3-A title game, 47-14, with a stunning rushing attack that 
had to be seen to be believed. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, it was the finest backfield in county history. Twenty years 
later, it still ranks as one of the best. 
</P>
<P>
 Myron White, a senior tailback who shifted into gears others couldn't match, 
and Fred Morales, a poised junior quarterback, controlled the pace of most 
games. Many times, they did what they pleased, took what they wanted. Late in 
the season, it appeared almost comical. 
</P>
<P>
 Against the backdrop of the Watergate hearings, President Nixon's resignation 
and the kidnaping of newspaper heiress Patricia Hearst, Santa Ana Valley began 
the '74 season hoping to measure up to the '73 team that won the Irvine League 
championship before losing in the second round of the 4-A playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 In the off-season, Santa Ana Valley was moved to 3-A and placed in the Freeway 
League. 
</P>
<P>
 And, after a few stumbles, it became apparent that this team was far superior 
to past squads. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Dick Hill recently said the 1974 team had only one weakness and when an 
inexperienced offensive line began to make progress and mature, it also became 
outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our line was young and innocent," Hill said. "That's why we got beat and tied 
a couple of times early." 
</P>
<P>
 By midseason it was clear there was little chance of stopping the Falcons. 
They simply had too many great athletes. Once they jelled, they were 
unbeatable. 
</P>
<P>
 The backfield stands out most of all. 
</P>
<P>
 Any discussion of the team's strengths begins and ends with White. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the finest back of his era. According to Hill, he could have put many 
rushing records out of reach. Instead, Hill pulled White when the game was in 
hand. There was no sense running up the score and subjecting White to cheap 
shots and possible injury, Hill figured. Fact was, White missed two 
early-season games because of the terrible pounding he took in games. 
</P>
<P>
 In the end, White rushed for 4,164 yards in his three-year varsity career, an 
Orange County record that stood for more than 10 years. He was 3-A player of 
the year in 1974 and was the first player to be named The Times' Orange County 
back of the year in consecutive seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 And if there was any doubt about his greatness, his final two games in the 
playoffs secured his status as a prep legend. 
</P>
<P>
 Against Monrovia, in the semifinals, White rushed for 250 yards and three 
touchdowns in an 18-7 victory. In the final against Colton, he gained 204 yards 
and scored three touchdowns despite playing only a few downs in the second 
half. 
</P>
<P>
 "As fine a running back as I've seen in a long time," said former Falcon 
Athletic Director Larry Arason, then a coach at Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had so much natural ability," former Falcon baseball Coach Herschel Musick 
said. "He could have excelled in anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Hill: "Boy, was he a competitor. Myron got beat up some of the time 
because in those days you could spear, and I hated that. Some great football 
players got really beat up. They'd come in with the helmet with second hits and 
there was nothing you could do about it. Some games they worked Myron over." 
</P>
<P>
 White simply kept running. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Myron would have gone to UCLA, we would never have heard of Wendell 
Tyler," Morales said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilbert Haslip played fullback, running free and clear when opponents focused 
too sharply on stopping White. 
</P>
<P>
 Haslip, who earned all-county honors as a linebacker, was strong and tough. 
"Tremendous," is Hill's recollection of Haslip. 
</P>
<P>
 He had two touchdowns in the championship game, although Hill remembers 
Haslip's defensive contributions more fondly. 
</P>
<P>
 "We shut Colton out in the first half and that was awesome," he said. "They 
were undefeated and had killed everybody. They were so physical it was almost 
scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Noble Franklin, a wide receiver and defensive back, was another standout. 
</P>
<P>
 Terry Franklin, Noble's brother, also played receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Tesimale stood 5 feet 11 and weighed only 190 pounds, but he earned 
all-section honors as an offensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Easley was a tremendous defensive lineman. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales led by example. He had poise and leadership qualities all right, but 
he was a big guy and nobody messed with him, Hill said. 
</P>
<P>
 He wasn't counted on to throw frequently, but when he did the results were 
often spectacular. Again, teams that tried too hard to stop White paid the 
price. 
</P>
<P>
 One crucial play on the Falcons' second possession in the title game proved 
the point. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that play, I knew the game was over," Morales said. "We ran a blast 
pass. I faked to Myron running up the middle and threw a button hook to Noble 
Franklin for a (53-yard) touchdown." 
</P>
<P>
 With a Colton defensive lineman lying on him, Morales heard the crowd's roar 
and told the late-charging sacker, "The game's over." 
</P>
<P>
 By halftime, the Falcons led, 34-0, and Morales and his teammates had rolled 
up 332 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we scored first, we dominated the game," Morales said. "There was 
no stopping us. That team was just amazing. I consider myself very fortunate to 
be on that team. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Backup quarterback) John Holland was just as good. For some reason Coach 
Hill picked me." 
</P>
<P>
 Like most teams of that period, Santa Ana Valley concentrated on its running 
game. Even if White and Haslip hadn't been so good, Hill would have run more 
than passed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think there was a better backfield around," Morales said. "I wouldn't 
have to make any fakes. I'd just hand Myron the ball. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we did pass, we were very effective because our running game was so 
awesome. Noble Franklin was a great wide receiver. I could throw it at his 
ankles and he'd never miss a stride. 
</P>
<P>
 "The offensive line really came around. I had great protection. I got sacked 
only three or four times all year. We couldn't have done it without them." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley opened the playoffs with a 22-6 victory over Claremont, 
ripped Villa Park, 35-6, squeaked past Burbank Burroughs, 22-14, and outlasted 
Monrovia, 18-7. 
</P>
<P>
 Colton went into the title game undefeated, having averaged 41.5 points and 
scored 50 points or more five times. 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Markham, Colton's coach, and Hill clashed on what to do when a game 
turned into a rout. Markham was eager to run up the score; Hill liked to play 
the substitutes. 
</P>
<P>
 The Falcons were probably the underdogs when the teams met Friday, Dec. 21, at 
Orange Show Stadium in San Bernardino. Certainly, they walked into unfriendly 
surroundings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got to that Orange Show and they had that thing full on both sides," Hill 
said. "We made them get off our side. We had buses filled with our fans." 
</P>
<P>
 Hill sensed his players were scared before the game. When they hit the field, 
however, any intimidation factor melted away. 
</P>
<P>
 White carried the ball 13 times, scoring on runs of one, 52 and 61 yards. 
Haslip scored on 25- and one-yard runs. The Falcons led 47-0 before Colton 
scored midway through the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boy, our kids came up to standards so high," Hill said. "They were so good. 
It was one of the most gratifying experiences I've ever had." 
</P>
<P>
 The next morning, the seniors awoke to read this lead in The Times: 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley kissed an era goodby Friday night, but how sweet it was.  
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, they would never play football together again. Some drifted off to 
other sports -- to basketball, baseball and track and field. Some played 
college football. Others never put on a pair of shoulder pads again. 
</P>
<P>
 White signed to play baseball with the Dodgers instead of accepting a 
scholarship to play football at UCLA. He never played in the majors, and a 
later bid to play football at the University of Hawaii never panned out. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night Ray Pallares of Valencia broke his county career rushing record 
in 1985, White was living in a small town in the San Joaquin Valley, far from 
the local football scene he once dominated. 
</P>
<P>
 "I should have been two people," White told The Times in 1985. "If I'd cloned 
myself, I might have known which sport to play. The barbershop-type guys, the 
older guys around Santa Ana, the church folks, they say I should have played 
football. But if I had played eight years in the big leagues, what would they 
have said then? That I should have played football still? It's a situation 
where I'll never know." 
</P>
<P>
 Morales went on to become the boys' basketball coach at Bethel Baptist in 
Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill remembers many others, including Franklin and Haslip, playing college 
football. 
</P>
<P>
 In later years, Hill pumped new life into the program at Santa Ana, leading 
the Saints into the 1986 Southern Conference title game, which they lost, 
26-10, to El Toro. 
</P>
<P>
 Hill, still at it after all these years, coached Orange to a 4-6 record this 
past season. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley hasn't played in a championship game since 1974.

SAN CLEMENTE INCHES SHORT OF FULFILLING PLAYOFF DREAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE TERRY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some impossible dreams are just that -- impossible. But it doesn't make the 
journey any less wonderful, the effort no less rewarding. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen years ago, San Clemente embarked on an amazing trek through the 
Southern Section football playoffs. The Tritons were a third-place team from 
the South Coast League, but they came within a first down of perhaps stealing 
the Central Coast Division title from Esperanza. No San Clemente team had 
gotten that far before. None has since. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a talented but relatively small team that ran out of the wishbone 
formation under Coach Ally Schaff. The Tritons finished second in the league in 
total offense, led by all-league running back Geoff Banners (who also made 
all-league as a defensive back). But they did not figure to be as good as the 
1975 and '78 San Clemente teams, which were favored to win section 
championships only to be upset each time in the conference semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best team was definitely the 1975 team," said Schaff, now retired, 
recalling the squad that was 10-0 and ranked No. 1 in the conference until 
losing to Sonora, 7-4. "But that 1979 team could put points on the board. And 
it could play defense. It was a fun team." 
</P>
<P>
 "I had played on the 1978 team," said Curt Arons, a defensive end, "and going 
into 1979 I thought we were going to have a real good team. Then we lost a 
couple of games early and I didn't know what was going on." Arons, who now 
works in the family business selling janitorial supplies in San Clemente, was 
one of the Triton mainstays. He was part of the defense that topped the South 
Coast League in fewest yards allowed (782 rushing, 1,028 passing) and fewest 
points allowed (115). But even with Banners, who rushed for 665 yards and nine 
touchdowns in the nine regular-season games, the San Clemente offense was 
inconsistent in a 5-4 regular season. It blew apart teams like University, 
28-0, and Laguna Hills, 42-14; then sputtered against El Toro, 29-15, and 
Mission Viejo, 22-12. 
</P>
<P>
 a "We were kinda like the San Diego Chargers back then -- get to the important 
game and not make it," Banners said. 
</P>
<P>
 The first-round game against Paramount was the spark to ignite the Tritons. 
</P>
<P>
 e Whatever anxiety the Tritons had dissipated when they discovered that their 
speed could counter Paramount's size. "We had a little quickness on them," 
Schaff said. Particularly on defense; they held the Pirates to zero yards 
rushing in the game. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a 14-14 tie at the end of regulation. In the tiebreaker system, each 
team was given the ball on the other's 10-yard line and given four chances to 
score. Paramount got the ball first but was stuffed. When it was San Clemente's 
turn, Banners -- who had scored both Triton touchdowns -- swept around right 
end on San Clemente's first play and just got into the end zone. 
</P>
<P>
 The roll had begun. Next were victories against Costa Mesa, and El Dorado -- 
the last unbeaten Orange County team still in the playoffs. The Tritons could 
feel destiny lining up with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were this Cinderella story," said Jon Hamro, a tight end who is now an 
assistant football coach at San Clemente. "When we first got in the playoffs it 
was 'What are we doing here?' But after the Paramount game we believed we could 
win. And now we had the whole town behind us." 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente now was poised to become the second consecutive third-place South 
Coast team to win a section title. (Mission Viejo had done it in 1978, 
defeating El Dorado in the championship game.) Standing in the Tritons' way was 
Esperanza, which featured Mike Keefe, one of the county's top running backs. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 5,000 fans filled Santa Ana Stadium for the final. It was a tight 
game, but Keefe, who rushed for 121 yards, gave the Aztecs a definite edge. He 
scored on a three-yard run in the second quarter, and pushed Esperanza's lead 
to 14-0 with a nine-yard run five seconds into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente zipped 71 yards for a touchdown, Jim Mounce getting the final 10 
yards on a bootleg with 6:58 left to play but got no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt we had done our best," Banners said. "We had done what no other San 
Clemente team had done." 
</P>
<P>
 That season marked the Tritons' sixth straight playoff appearance. It was 14 
years before they made it back to the postseason.

championships. Pugmire ran the three-mile course at Mt.San Antonio College in 
17 minutes 45 seconds, more than a minute faster than she ran last season.

NOTEBOOK; CUTTING TEAM TO 30 WORKS FOR UNIVERSITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 University football Coach Mark Cunningham took a drastic step this season when 
he listened to his players and limited the team to 30 players. It was 
successful. After consecutive 1-9 seasons, the Trojans were 4-5-1 and in the 
playoffs for only the fifth time in 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 He calls them the Dirty 30. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our record didn't indicate it, but we were competitive with all but Corona 
del Mar and Irvine last year; in five games, we were ahead at halftime," 
Cunningham said. "And we had kids sitting on the sideline talking about pizza 
and squirting water bottles at each other. It made me decide I was going to go 
with 30 kids who were focused. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do a player evaluation at the end of each season, and the football players 
coming back said if we only have 11 guys, then we only have 11 guys, but we 
can't have people who don't care." 
</P>
<P>
 So he let 23 potential varsity players eliminate themselves during preseason 
workouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Myron Miller (and Costa Mesa) can make it to the finals with 22 kids (last 
year). . . ," Cunningham said. "I think those guys were all on the same page, 
they had the same goals, the same vision, the same focus. If you have 21 kids 
or 41 kids, if they have the same focus and same goals, you can make it work. 
We ended up with 30 that I think fit that mold. 
</P>
<P>
 "The kids said they wanted someone to feel football is important, and if you 
wear the uniform, you've earned it. They didn't want anyone wearing the uniform 
they felt didn't earn it, and if the kids are saying that, I have to listen." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dirty 30's first step toward repeating Costa Mesa's success of a year ago 
was a misstep; the Trojans were beaten, 24-0, by top-seeded La Mirada in the 
first round of the Division VIII playoffs. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 El Dorado Coach Rick Jones put into perspective this week his team's 
forfeitures -- and the lack of a playoff game despite winning its first league 
title since 1981.  
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things you have to deal with as coach is take difficult situations 
and build a positive situation out of it," Jones said. "The positive here? This 
is definitely a dose of real life. Things happen to you that you don't deserve. 
As football players and as people, we can only stay the course, fight the 
battle and learn how to deal with that. Or you can quit. El Dorado football is 
more than football. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they leave here knowing only how to block and tackle, then we've failed as 
coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado's ineligible player was a ninth-semester senior. Though most coaches 
agree that an oversight is an oversight and it's a shame to make students 
suffer for an adult's mistake, they generally forget there is one person who 
would know whether the player was ineligible -- the player himself. 
</P>
<P>
 One person who has faced down his share of 11th-hour accusations of using 
ineligible players is Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to have an incredible checklist for every athlete that comes to 
this school," Barnes said. "But it still won't be 100% foolproof. It still 
won't be perfect and someone still can lie to you and break the system." 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos wide receiver Brad Melsby broke the Orange County record for 
career touchdown receptions and has moved near another record. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby had eight receptions for 146 yards and three touchdowns during the 
Griffins' 37-22 victory over Bellflower St. John Bosco in the first round of 
the Division I playoffs Friday. He has 35 touchdown receptions for his career, 
surpassing the old mark held by Kennedy's Rick Parma, who had 34 from 1973-75. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby also has 176 career receptions, one shy of the county record held by 
former Los Alamitos receiver George Sagen. Sagen caught 177 passes from 
1990-91. La Puente Bishop Amat's J.K. McKay, who played at USC, holds the 
Southern Section record with 207 receptions from 1968-70.

 The State girls' volleyball tournament begins tonight with some curious 
pairings that have Orange County coaches shaking their heads. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division II, Huntington Beach received the top seeding and Edison is seeded 
fourth. Both teams were beaten Thursday in the Southern Section Division I 
semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 But Edison (17-2, 9-1 in league) won the Sunset League and Huntington Beach 
(16-4, 8-2) finished second. The teams split their head-to-head league matches 
but Edison was ranked seventh in the final CIF State coaches' poll and 
Huntington Beach was ranked 10th. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good for us so I thought CIF did a heck of a job," Huntington Beach 
Coach Rocky Ciarelli said laughing. "But it's kind of weird." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Edison Coach Dave Mohs: "I've stopped trying to figure it out. I just 
hate things that seem to have no logic." 
</P>
<P>
 Edison opens the State tournament tonight with a home match against 
Bakersfield North and Escondido San Pasqual plays at Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Naming Newport Harbor the top-seeded team for the Southern California region 
of the State girls' volleyball tournament was the easiest decision for the 
state committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Sailors, top-ranked in the nation by polls in USA Today and Volleyball 
Monthly, defeated Manhattan Beach Mira Costa, 15-5, 15-1, 15-7, in the Southern 
Section Division I final Saturday, posting the most lopsided victory in the 
history of major division finals. 
</P>
<P>
 And there is more bad news for the Sailors' opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Saturday, we played the best we have this season by far," Glenn said. "But we 
can play better." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They said it: 
</P>
<P>
 * "We're an Orange County team and we think this game should be played in 
Orange County." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Los Alamitos Coach John Barnes, saying why the Griffins are playing host 
Long Beach Poly at Orange Coast College Friday instead of Long Beach Veterans 
Stadium -- which is the home field for both teams. 
</P>
<P>
 * "If you don't win on the road in the first round, you don't deserve to be in 
the playoffs." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Myron Miller, Costa Mesa football coach, on the day the seedings were 
released. The Mustangs lost in the first round, on the road, to Riverside Norte 
Vista, 28-12, in Division VIII.

 Water polo/Two-meter man

 Because the Sea Kings have so many outstanding players, Buzolich doesn't 
receive too many accolades, but Coach John Vargas is appreciative. "I think 
he's really a selfless player," Vargas said."He sits back and does all the 
little things and when we need him, he steps up and takes a big role 
offensively." Buzolich did most of his work on defense Saturday, holding 
Foothill's two-meter men to only one goal between them in Corona del Mar's 6-4 
victory in the Division I semifinal. Buzolich also scored a goal to give the 
Sea Kings a 5-2 lead. He scored three goals in a 16-7 victory over Trabuco 
Hills.
