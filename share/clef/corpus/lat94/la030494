HOME TECH / VIDEO: 'FUGITIVE' RUNS HOME; MOVIES: EVEN THOUGH THE HIT FILM IS 
BACK IN THEATERS, WARNERS RUSHES ITS VIDEO RELEASE ON THE HEELS OF OSCAR 
NOMINATIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 In an unusual case of overlap, "The Fugitive" will be released on home video 
Thursday while the Academy Award-nominated film is still playing in theaters. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 There has been industry speculation that Warner Bros.' decision to move up the 
home video release -- it originally had been scheduled for March 22, the day 
after the Oscar ceremonies -- was fueled by the tepid response to the 
theatrical reissue, despite the film's seven nominations, including one as best 
picture. 
</P>
<P>
 But that suggestion was denied by Warner Bros. spokesman Ron Friedman, who 
pointed out that the announcement about the change in the home-video release 
date was made Feb. 16 -- before the reissue of "The Fugitive," not in response 
to the tiny crowds attracted by the movie's return to theaters. The film took 
in about $774,000 at the box office last weekend, compared to $6.5 million for 
top-grossing "Ace Ventura: Pet Detective." 
</P>
<P>
 Friedman said "The Fugitive" is lackluster in theaters now because its initial 
theatrical release last summer was so successful, grossing more than $180 
million -- indicating that nearly everyone who wanted to see it at the movies 
had already done so. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner Home Video executives declined to discuss their reason for moving up 
the release of "The Fugitive," but many in the home-video industry assume it 
was because, like their counterparts in the movie division who decided to put 
the film back in theaters, they saw an opportunity to make extra money off the 
Oscar nominations. With growing consensus that "Schindler's List" will win as 
best picture, "The Fugitive" (priced at $25) may be more appealing now, while 
it's still in the running, than on March 22, when it would be an also-ran. 
</P>
<P>
 "People have started talking so much about 'Schindler' as best picture that 
the Warner people probably decided it would be smart to change the release 
date," said John Thrasher, vice president of video purchasing for Tower Records 
and Video. "The buzz about 'The Fugitive' would be bigger before the Oscar show 
than after, when the buzz might be over. They figured that Tommy Lee Jones' 
supporting actor nomination was worth something right away in the rental 
market. So now they have two weekends of the movie in the rental market as an 
Oscar nominee. That would mean better sales for Warner." 
</P>
<P>
 Distributors speculate that for a March 22 release, Warner would have shipped 
about 4.7 million copies of the film. Coming out March 10, that figure may 
climb to 5 million or higher, they say. It will be the only major 
Oscar-nominated movie in the home video market for now. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, "The Fugitive" probably won't be the top home-video title this 
spring. Distributors and retailers believe that honor will go to "Mrs. 
Doubtfire,"the Robin Williams comedy due April 26 at $20. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's cheaper than 'Fugitive' and it's more of a family movie and has wider 
appeal," Thrasher said. "At the end of the year, I think 'Fugitive' shipments 
will be around 7 million copies and 'Mrs. Doubtfire' will be $8 million to $10 
million." 
</P>
<P>
 Video Olympics 
</P>
<P>
 In case you haven't had enough of the Winter Olympics, CBS Video is releasing 
highlights tapes on April 6. For $20, there's an overall highlights tape and 
one focusing on the figure skating competition. There's also a two-cassette, 
$40 set, covering both the figure skating competition and exhibition. No, 
there's no separate tape on the Kerrigan-Harding scandal. All tapes will 
feature footage not show on TV. 
</P>
<P>
 New on Video 
</P>
<P>
 "Demolition Man" (Warner). In this sci-fi thriller, an L.A. cop (Sylvester 
Stallone) and a super-villain (Wesley Snipes) are frozen, then thaw out in 
2032, when the world is tame and excessively automated. There's some amusing 
social satire as these two battle each other in a milquetoast environment, but 
it's mainly an orgy of mind-boggling mayhem that's a treat for dedicated action 
fans. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Good Son" (FoxVideo). A fast-paced thriller, set in Maine, that works 
most of the time, despite some glaring implausibilities. It relies on the shock 
value of a murderous villain (Macaulay Culkin) who's 12. The evil kid 
victimizes his cousin (Elijah Wood), who's grieving his dead mother. Playing 
against his goody-goody "Home Alone" image, Culkin doesn't have the acting 
range to be that convincing but Wood is very good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Much Ado About Nothing" (Columbia TriStar). Great cast -- director-star 
Kenneth Branagh, Emma Thompson, Denzel Washington, Michael Keaton, Keanu Reeves 
-- and lushly filmed, but only so-so entertainment. Branagh, rather than 
offering a bold new interpretation, brings Shakespeare down a notch or two so 
the average person can understand what's going on in this comedy about the 
romantic trials of Beatrice (Thompson) and Benedick (Branagh).  
</P>
<P>
 "Striking Distance" (Columbia TriStar). The ex-girlfriends of a Pittsburgh 
river patrol cop (Bruce Willis) are being bumped off by a serial killer. The 
cop, who falls for his partner (Sarah Jessica Parker), has other problems -- 
he's an alcoholic and scorned by his colleagues as a turncoat. A promising 
action/suspense movie that holds your interest until the plot turns 
preposterous in the second half. 
</P>
<P>
 "Needful Things" (New Line). In this adaptation of a Stephen King horror tale, 
a small-town shopkeeper (Max Von Sydow) is really Satan, bartering for souls 
and turning the townspeople against each other. Starts out somewhat eerie and 
chilling but becomes progressively silly as the town self-destructs. Plenty 
here to please King fanatics and hard-core horror fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming 
</P>
<P>
 Just announced: FoxVideo's "Mrs. Doubtfire," starring Robin Williams, is out 
April 26 after another FoxVideo movie, "The Beverly Hillbillies," is out April 
6.

I Married an Axe Murderer" (Wednesday); "The Fugitive" (Thursday); "Undercover

 Study Finds Doubled Violence Coverage: The three network evening TV newscasts 
doubled their coverage of crime and violence around the country last year, even 
though the nation's overall crime rate remains essentially unchanged, according 
to the Washington's Center for Media and Public Affairs. A survey by the center 
also found that coverage of murders was three times as high in 1993 as in 1992, 
while the national murder rate remained steady. The networks aired 1,632 
domestic crime stories -- accounting for one of every eight spots, the survey 
found. NBC had the highest tally with 626, followed by CBS with 557 and ABC 
with 449. This compared to 1992 when they aired only 830 crime stories -- one 
of every 18 reported. "People's fear of crime doesn't come from looking over 
their shoulders," said Robert Lichter, the center's co-director. "It comes from 
looking at their television screens." ABC news anchor Peter Jennings, while 
noting that he generally distrusts "counts without context" by TV researchers, 
said that he too has noticed a surge in TV news' coverage of violence, 
coinciding with increasing public concern.

 * Fox Tries Kids Radio: Fox Children's Network is breaking into radio with the 
launch of Fox Kids Radio, a "global kids radio network" scheduled to begin May 
8 with a weekly two-hour countdown of songs chosen by children and teens. "By 
creating Fox Kids Radio, we have the opportunity to . . . create a unique 
entertainment source for children," said Fox Chairman Lucie Salhany. The 
syndicated programming is scheduled to be broadcast on Sundays in cities across 
the United States and overseas. 
</P>
<P>
 * 'Tom' Trails 'Beverly Hills': KTTV-TV Channel 11 was the most watched 
station in the Los Angeles market between 8 and 10 p.m. Wednesday as "Beverly 
Hills, 90210" and "Melrose Place" stomped the network competition with their 
highest ratings of the season. The Fox station averaged an 18.2 rating during 
that time (with each point representing about 50,000 homes), compared to 10.6 
for KNBC-TV Channel 4, 8.7 for KABC-TV Channel 7 and 7.5 for KCBS-TV Channel 2, 
whose programming included the debut of Tom Arnold's latest sitcom, "Tom." 
Nationally, "Tom" ran third in its 8:30 time slot. OPERA

<P>
 Domingo Starts Voice Contest: The first of what is planned as an annual 
international competition for opera singers sponsored by superstar tenor 
Placido Domingo gets underway in March. The Placido Domingo Vocal Competition, 
also called "Operalia '94," is open to singers up to age 33 and will start with 
national competitions in Argentina, Australia, Austria, France, Germany, Italy, 
Japan, Mexico, Spain, Sweden, Britain and the United States. Semi-finals will 
then be held at the Vienna State Opera House in May, and the televised finals 
take place in Mexico City Sept. 17. Winners in five categories -- soprano, 
mezzo-soprano, tenor, baritone and bass -- will receive $25,000 each, plus 
singing engagements and possible recording opportunities. MOVIES

 A Christian Stamp of Approval: Sixteen of 1993's top 25-grossing films met 
with the approval of the Atlanta-based Christian Film and Television 
Commission, which announced on Thursday its "10 Best 1993 Family Films." 
Heading the list were "Homeward Bound: The Incredible Journey," "Searching for 
Bobby Fischer," "Gettysburg," "Free Willy" and "The Meteor Man." The group's 
chairman, Christian film critic Ted Baehr, championed the cause of family 
values during the group's annual awards luncheon, noted that three of the 
year's top 10 money earners -- "Sleepless in Seattle," "Free Willy" and 
"Groundhog Day" -- fit within the group's Motion Picture & Television Code. 
That success, he said, "confirms there's a huge audience of people who will 
support moral entertainment. . . . Success at the box office can be linked 
directly to stories that appeal to the broad segment of American society that 
upholds traditional Judeo-Christian ideals and values. You can bank on it."

co-creator Steven Bochco will receive the 1994 Paddy Chayefsky Laurel Award for 
Television from the Writers Guild of America. The award is the guild's highest 
TV honor and is rarely presented mid-career. Bochco will receive the award 
March 13 during the guild's annual award ceremonies. . . . Barbara Walters 
interviews director Steven Spielberg in her annual ABC Oscar-night special 
following the March 21 broadcast. In addition to Spielberg, whose "Schindler's 
List" is favored to win several Academy Awards that night, Walters will 
interview "Sleepless in Seattle" star Meg Ryan and pop superstar Elton John. .

MOVIE REVIEW; 'ANGIE,'THY NAME IS GEENA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH TURAN, TIMES FILM CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stardom is a ladder with many rungs, and "Angie" (citywide) announces Geena 
Davis' arrival at the top. An unapologetic star vehicle whose every moment is 
crafted to showcase her various abilities, this is as much a coronation as a 
motion picture, a trumpet call to the world insisting that attention be paid. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not that Davis, always a fluid, engaging actress, has lacked for 
attention up to now. "The Accidental Tourist" won her an Oscar, "Thelma & 
Louise" earned a second nomination and "A League of Their Own" was a 
considerable hit. But while those were roles the actress took hold of and made 
her own, "Angie" is a part specifically tailored to demonstrate what she can 
do. 
</P>
<P>
 And as Ms. Scacciapensieri, a feisty Italian American resident of the 
Bensonhurst section of Brooklyn whose unexpected pregnancy brings on the usual 
journey of self-discovery, Davis gets to do a lot. She laughs and cries, talks 
dirty and acts sexy, lashes out in anger and whispers in repentance. Plus she 
wears big earrings and participates in an unusually hectic delivery room scene 
that is the film's comic centerpiece. 
</P>
<P>
 Judged as a vehicle to display Davis' talent, "Angie" can't be faulted, and 
neither can the actress's pumped-up performance as a woman in the process of 
harnessing her emotional strength. Brash and irresistible, Davis is as assured 
as she's ever been, displaying a believable Brooklyn accent and taking every 
advantage of the scenes laid on for her specific pleasure. 
</P>
<P>
 When "Angie" is considered apart from its lead performance, however, the 
results are much more mixed. As directed by Martha Coolidge ("Rambling Rose") 
and written by Todd Graff from a novel by Avra Wing, "Angie" is too much the 
standard women's picture, overloaded with a laundry list of uninspired 
soap-opera dilemmas. 
</P>
<P>
 Abandoned at age 3 by a free-spirited mother she's never heard from or 
forgotten, Angie, in her early 30s, is a Brooklyn working woman whose life has 
settled into a not unpleasant routine. She and best friend Tina (the feisty 
Aida Turturro) spend their days working in Manhattan. At night Angie goes to 
movies like "Cliffhanger" with the good-hearted Vinnie (James Gandolfini), a 
plumber who's been her boyfriend since ninth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Angie finds herself pregnant, very little stays the same. Vinnie, a 
stand-up guy, is ecstatic and eager for an immediate wedding, but Angie is not 
sure she wants to get married at all. Her pregnancy has brought to the surface 
a raft of discontents -- submerged dissatisfactions with her father (Philip 
Bosco), her meddling stepmother (Jenny O'Hara), even poor dare-to-be-average 
Vinnie. 
</P>
<P>
 Like any fairy-tale heroine, Angie is destined for other things. And another 
man. During a daring daylight visit to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, she 
attracts the notice of Noel ("The Crying Game's" Stephen Rea), a smooth 
Irishman who knows lots about art and ballet and isn't above sharing his 
knowledge with the forthright Angie. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Noel turns out to have a few wrinkles of his own, he is symptomatic of 
where "Angie" misfires. Even as fine an actor as Rea can't make something 
involving out of his stock character, the fantasy boyfriend, 
is-he-too-good-to-be-true division. And just about every situation Angie finds 
herself in is similarly schematic. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it's worrying about commitment and the demands of motherhood or making 
jokes about vibrators and gynecological exams, all of Angie's actions seem to 
come off some grand checklist of required female-friendly plot elements, there 
because they have to be, not because they fit. 
</P>
<P>
 And though the performances of Davis and Turturro and the writing behind their 
characters' wit go a ways to keep things lively, "Angie" ends up feeling like 
"Cliffhanger" in drag, a mechanical piece of work set in motion to push the 
buttons in women the way that the over-amped Sly Stallone vehicle tries to do 
for men.

MOVIE REVIEWS; 'OSCAR' A MOSTLY HIGH-QUALITY GROUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 "Oscar Shorts '93," composed of the three short documentaries and four of the 
five live-action shorts nominated for Academy Awards, opens today at the Monica 
4-Plex. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The quality of the documentaries is so high that it will take the wisdom of 
Solomon to to pick a winner among them. The live-action entries are another 
matter: only two were available for this program, and one is as outstanding as 
the other is dreadful. Those not shown are: Susan Seidelman's "The Dutch 
Master," Didier Flamand's "The Screw," and Peter Weller's "Partners." 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Cantor's 30-minute "Blood Ties: The Life and Work of Sally Mann" 
explores the predicament of Mann, a gifted and acclaimed photographer who has 
incurred the wrath of some because some of the countless photos she has taken 
of her three young children have depicted them in the nude. (The children, age 
6, 9 and 11, insist that their mother has never asked them to disrobe to be 
photographed.) Intent on standing up for her right of freedom of expression, 
Mann is clearly a serious, responsible artist, articulate in her own defense. 
There is nothing suggestive or titillating in her stunning, poetically 
beautiful work. 
</P>
<P>
 Elaine Holliman's warm and engaging 22-minute "Chicks in White Satin" 
introduces us to two young lesbians who have been lovers for eight years and 
who decide that they want a traditional marriage, with both of them wearing 
white gowns. This warm, graceful film becomes a dual portrait in courage as the 
women face rejection from some relatives and who, most important, must win over 
one of the women's mothers, who feels uneasy at the prospect of the ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be hard to imagine a film more effective in raising consciousness 
about the plight of battered women than Margaret Lazarus and Renner 
Wunderlich's 30-minute "Defending Our Lives," which intercuts the remarks of 
human-rights activist Stacey Kabat, herself a battered wife, with interviews 
with eight women who recite with absolute conviction their harrowing existence 
as the wives of husbands physically abusive to the extent of endangering their 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 The film points up how ineffectual police can be in protecting such women; 
Kabat states that in the United States, there are three times as many shelters 
for animals as there are for battered women. As fine as this film is, it would 
have been even stronger had it delved, even briefly, into the reasons why men 
brutalize women. 
</P>
<P>
 The presence of such pros as Jason Alexander and Edward Asner in Stacy Title's 
"Down on the Waterfront," a talky, boring 27-minute drama about a pair of young 
filmmakers meeting with union officials, is of no help whatsoever. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, German filmmaker Pepe Danquart's 12-minute "Black Rider" is 
a miracle of wit and economy, as a black man (Paul Outlaw) comes up with a 
deft, amusing revenge upon his streetcar seatmate, an older German who spouts 
nonstop hatred and contempt of Turkish, Italian and, especially, African 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Also being screened is last year's live-action short Oscar winner, Sam 
Karmann's eight-minute "Omnibus," which deals with a harried office worker 
(Daniel Rialet) who boards his usual commuter train only to find that the 
schedule has changed, a surprise he regards as catastrophic. No wonder this gem 
walked off with a top prize at Cannes as well as an Academy Award.

MOVIE REVIEW; FILM LEAVES FANS 'GREEDY' FOR MORE KIRK DOUGLAS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Kirk Douglas is so good in "Greedy" (general release) that you're tempted to 
forgive this wildly uneven satire its overkill script and often ponderous 
direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Douglas is cast as an aged but vigorous self-made scrap-metal tycoon whose 
declining health neither prevents him from going to work nor taking tremendous 
relish in watching his various nephews and nieces currying slavish favor in 
hopes of inheriting his $20-million fortune. 
</P>
<P>
 It is gratifying to see a great veteran star in a major role -- no cameo this 
-- in which he brings a lifetime of experience in a portrayal rich in sly, deft 
nuances and details. Douglas' sheer presence holds the film together when all 
else flounders. Ironically, with a tough-minded rewrite and a lighter touch, 
"Greedy" might have been as good as Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 What's wrong here is crystal clear from the start. Writers Lowell Ganz and 
Babaloo Mandel, who should have known better, load up Douglas with three craven 
nephews -- Ed Begley Jr., Phil Hartman and Jere Burns -- and an equally grabby 
niece, Colleen Camp, and caricature them to the extent that they don't seem to 
be in the same film with Douglas' long-lost grandnephew, Michael J. Fox, his 
girlfriend, Nancy Travis, or Douglas' gorgeous but honorable new companion, 
Olivia d'Abo. (Douglas, luckily, is able to play off them all.) 
</P>
<P>
 The relentlessly one-dimensional cousins and their awful spouses become 
tiresome and stupendously obvious even before they've completed their first 
scenes; one or two cousins would have sufficed. 
</P>
<P>
 There are moments when you wonder why anyone would pay to see a 
money-isn't-everything lecture from two of the most successful screenwriters in 
the history of the movies, and Ganz and Mandel's bursts of moralizing tend to 
overshadow their valid point of how even the nicest people -- i.e., Fox's 
none-too-successful pro bowler and d'Abo's decent care-giver -- can be tempted 
by vast sums without even realizing it. 
</P>
<P>
 The writers also don't overlook the tycoon's own responsibility in the 
degrading, endless manipulation of his relatives. The film doesn't shy away 
from the tycoon's darker side and neither does Douglas. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, however, director Jonathan Lynn cannot impose any kind of evenness 
of tone upon "Greedy," which wants too hard to be a ruthlessly honest and 
bouncy mainstream entertainment at the same time.  
</P>
<P>
 As with Douglas, Lynn and the writers do very well by d'Abo and especially 
Fox, who holds on to our sympathies even when his well-meaning character is in 
danger of selling out. Travis, who is able to be simultaneously funny and

MOVIE REVIEW; POST-WAR EAST GERMAN MYTHS REVEALED IN 'PROPAGANDA' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By PETER RAINER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The educational and instructional documentary footage in "Strictly Propaganda" 
(playing weekends at the Laemmle Monica Theaters) is chillingly funny. Wolfgang 
Kissel, who currently teaches at the Dresden Visual Arts School, assembled a 
cross-section of representative documentaries from the archives of DEFA -- the 
official state film studio of the now defunct German Democratic Republic -- 
ranging from the immediate postwar years to the last days of Erich Honecker in 
1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Kissel makes no attempt to "editorialize." He doesn't need to. The fascination 
of the footage is that, although it presents a sunny, upbeat view of post-war 
East Germany, the real story can't help breaking through the enforced 
joyousness. (It's as if you were watching two different movies: the one that 
was made and the one that wasn't.) The results are beyond satire. You can laugh 
at a scene like the one where a citizen is encouraged to take his vacation on a 
steamer cruise up the Volga, or the sequence where an honored party functionary 
praises Stalin as the prince of peace, but the laughter catches in your craw. 
</P>
<P>
 Documentaries are often mistakenly assumed to give us the "truth" but it takes 
a film like "Strictly Propaganda" to really undercut that bogus idea. It's 
difficult to imagine anyone in East Germany falling for much of what we see in 
this film, and yet, in their own crudely effective way, the DEFA filmmakers 
knew what they were doing. The repeated shots of blonde children romping and 
saluting are iconic in a way that is not so very different from the Aryan 
super-race imagery in Leni Riefenstahl's "Triumph of the Will." Only the 
uniforms, and the salute, are different. 
</P>
<P>
 As the years tick by in "Strictly Propaganda," slight rents in the social 
fabric emerge. The '60s introduced a more "questioning" student into the 
classroom, and so we're treated to an instructional documentary for teachers 
who attempt to defend the party line without alienating the class. There's also 
an instructional film for Berlin Wall border guards, including a re-enactment 
where a West German spy attempting to enter the country is tripped up by 
failing to recite the opening words of the Communist Manifesto. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an epic stretch from 1946 and the Soviet Occupation Zone to 1989 and the 
ascendancy of Gorbachev. What's eerie about "Strictly Propaganda" is that it 
never acknowledges the stretch. There's a weightlessness to the footage because 
it has so little connection to what was going on not only in East Germany, but 
in the rest of the world. The national portrait that emerges is "The Land That 
Time Forgot." Or more accurately, "The Land That Tried to Forget."

MOVIE REVIEW; NO-BRAINER RUNS OUT OF GAS IN 'CHASE'

<P>
 "The Chase" (citywide) is a no-brainer with the emphasis on the no . Charlie 
Sheen plays a wrongfully convicted bank robber running away from prison who 
inadvertently kidnaps an heiress (Kristy Swanson) and spends most of the movie 
speeding away from the police in her bright-red BMW. 
</P>
<P>
 Will a movie about a high-speed L.A. freeway chase satisfy an audience's 
fantasies for flight at a time when the freeways are cracked? Inquiring minds 
want to know. 
</P>
<P>
 The writer-director Adam Rifkin attempts to work some deep-think about tabloid 
media manipulation into this rollicking piece of movie road kill, but the film 
seems to be part of what it is attacking. It would take a more -- uh -- 
sophisticated touch to make the car flips and flame-outs in this film seem as 
hilarious as they are meant to be. Maybe Robert Altman, in his media-circus 
"Nashville" mode, could have done it. On the other hand, he would not have 
wanted to. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheen and Swanson go in for a lot of high-octane mugging but Josh Mostel, as 
one of the cops in pursuit, is fun, and there's a good bit involving cadavers.

<P>
 That figures.

MOVIE REVIEW; 'PEYOTE' A STRONG CASE FOR FREEDOM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KEVIN THOMAS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Peyote Road" (Saturdays and Sundays at 11 a.m. at the Sunset 5) is a dry 
but cogent, consciousness-raising documentary protesting the 1990 Supreme Court 
decision that denied First Amendment protection to the sacramental use of 
peyote by Native Americans in ceremonies that predate the Constitution by at 
least a millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 Filmmakers Fidel Moreno, Gary Rhine and Phil Cousineau, who made the 
award-winning "Wiping the Tears of Seven Generations," a documentary on the 
Bigfoot Memorial Ride, make their case easily that the Supreme Court's decision 
is so far-reaching that it jeopardizes freedom of religion itself. (One 
scholarly interviewee wonders whether the decision, which would take an act of 
Congress to overturn, could be used against circumcision and kosher 
slaughtering practices in Judaism.) 
</P>
<P>
 The documentarians marshal one Native American after another, many of them 
tribal elders and leaders, to explain to us that the use of peyote by many 
different tribes is a means of attaining a heightened awareness, as "a way of 
relating to the world" that "is done out of respect for the Creator." 
</P>
<P>
 Native American actor Rodney A. Grant, who appeared in "Dances With Wolves," 
guides us through a typical ceremony, which involves a circle of men -- women 
serve as water bearers -- sitting in a circle inside a tepee, staring at a fire 
in the tepee's center, meditating and praying for hours on end to the 
accompaniment of drumming and chanting. One participant states firmly that he 
had never had a hallucinatory experience nor has he ever known anyone who ever 
has. 
</P>
<P>
 This takes us to the heart of the matter, which is where the filmmakers slip 
up. They go to great and persuasive lengths to explain and defend the religious 
aspects of chewing peyote, harvested from a Southwestern cactus, and the 
cultural, political and legal implications of its use. However, they overlook 
scientific opinion, although one of their interviewees does cite a study 
showing that peyote doesn't harm our chromosomes or cause birth defects. Native 
Americans refer to peyote as a medicine or an herb rather than a drug, although 
Webster's, which refers you to the entry for mescal, mentions its 
hallucinogenic effect. 
</P>
<P>
 The opinions -- indeed, definitions -- from a couple of scientists would be 
most helpful here since we're being asked to regard peyote as the same as 
sacramental wine in Judeo-Christian rituals. But is this an appropriate 
comparison? The filmmakers may in fact be so caught up in preaching to the 
converted, assuming we know all about how peyote is prepared for consumption 
and how it is consumed and what its effects are, that they tend to overlook 
those of us who are open-minded and could be even more sympathetic to the 
freedom-of-religion aspects of their cause had they provided us with more 
precise, factual information about peyote use. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this not inconsiderable reservation, "The Peyote Road" does succeed in 
suggesting that the Supreme Court decision is yet another instance of the white 
man's ignorance and hypocrisy in regard to Native Americans.

MUSIC REVIEW; GUITAR GREATS MEET AT THE 'SUMMIT' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEF WOODARD 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was a diverse audience that filled the Ambassador Auditorium in Pasadena on 
Wednesday, for the first Southland stop of the definitively diverse Guitar 
Summit program. The message was clearly one of pluralism, bringing to one stage 
the disparate talents of guitar greats Joe Pass (jazz), Paco Pena (flamenco), 
Pepe Romero (classical) and Leo Kottke (Kottke-esque folk). 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, this was a Spanish-U.S. accord, reflecting styles from two cultures 
that have contributed greatly to the instrument's evolution. By nature a 
sampler, this program was no occasion for obscurity or chance-taking, but the 
overall musical substance of the three-hour concert had a powerful impact. 
</P>
<P>
 Kicking things off with the supple single line melody to "I Remember You," the 
self-effacing Pass wove his particular magic in the difficult realm of solo 
jazz guitar. Better than anyone on the scene, the self-reliant Pass mixes 
chordal and linear inventions and shifts between floating rhythm and an 
internal, propulsive sense of swing. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 From another improvisation-friendly musical style, Pena has mastered the 
flamenco vocabulary of scalar flurries, whisking arpeggios and percussive 
effects. Most importantly, he invests both precision and passion into his 
playing. In four characteristic pieces, Pena illustrated flamenco's bridge 
between serious and folk traditions. 
</P>
<P>
 True to the conservative nature of the program, Romero stuck to the stock 
stuff of "Romanza" and music by Tarrega, closing with "Fantasia," by his 
guitarist father, Celedonio. Behind a guitar, he exudes confidence and Spanish 
bravura, and boasts a mastery of tonal range. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways the most individualistic player of the evening, Kottke showed his 
uncanny ability to make folk music sound like capital-A art. His flowing brand 
of instrumental music, with his mumbling thumb and nimbly drawn swatches of 
melody -- both earthy and ethereal -- matches his trademarked droll 
between-song patter. In short, he's a virtuosic digressionist. 
</P>
<P>
 When the guitarists convened onstage at the end for a few tentative duets and 
one quartet piece, it didn't matter that they didn't exactly click together. 
This was a peace-keeping mission, setting aside differences and celebrating a 
few good masters. 
</P>
<P>
 The program moves to the Lobero Theater in Santa Barbara tonight, and to UCLA 
on Saturday. JOSEF WOODARD

RESTAURANT REVIEW; CHACO OFFERS A CONFUSING POTPOURRI

 The mineral water available is not the mineral water listed on the menu. The 
kitchen is often out of whatever wine is ordered. The service is earnest and 
friendly, but most of the staff seem generally baffled by their jobs. (To make 
two waiters understand that we want a quail egg on our salmon roe sushi, we 
draw a picture.) The language barriers are multiple -- so far as we can tell, 
the staff waiting on us speaks Spanish, Japanese, Tagalog. During each meal, at 
least one dish we order doesn't arrive. People are constantly coming up to us 
saying things we don't quite understand. The menu is complex and confusing. 
Food arrives in no discernible order. 
</P>
<P>
 At some point during each visit to Chaco in Beverly Hills, I had to take a 
deep breath and let go of everything I normally expect from a dining experience 
and sign on for the madcap ride. If the food weren't so wonderful, I might have 
been irritated. As it happened, I repeatedly wound up happy, if somewhat 
exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 Chaco, in the heart of the Beverly Hills shopping district, is a casual, 
smallish Japanese restaurant with a dining area, a sushi bar and an adjacent 
coffee bar. On the walls are posters of Godzilla and Mothra. Pink light 
emanates from recessed soffits. A vine, climbing up a pillar, is held in place 
with Scotch tape.  
</P>
<P>
 The menu offers a variety of fixed-price dinners, which come with soup, salad 
and dessert. There are sushi and sashimi dinners, tempura and teriyaki dinners, 
kushiaki dinners. ( Kushiaki are grilled skewered meats and vegetables.) There 
are two Westernized dinners, salmon or sea bass, and also larger, multicourse 
free-for-all dinners with names like Godzilla and King Gidora. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 One can also order a la carte. And there are individual sushi and kushiaki 
menus, to be filled out with a pen. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether we order dinners or a la carte or from the sushi and kushiaki menus -- 
or a combination of them all -- the food arrives in something of a pell-mell 
fashion, always prettily presented on a variety of interesting ceramics and 
lacquerware, and always missing some element -- a bowl of noodles, a small 
plate of fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 The sushi chef has a generous, loose style and, some nights, a heavy hand with 
wasabi. It's terribly fun to sit at the bar and mix sushi with kushiaki. The 
skewered meats are marinated, tender, full of flavor: I can't get enough of the 
beef short ribs and spicy pork. And I adore the vegetables wrapped in 
paper-thin bacon, the okra, asparagus, and best of all, little bundles of 
crunchy enoki mushrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Appetizers arrive any time during the meal -- and really, who cares? It might 
be nice to have a bowl of endagame , boiled fresh soy bean pods, while waiting 
for the first course -- one tends to eat them impulsively, like popcorn -- but 
they're just fine alongside soba noodles, too. 
</P>
<P>
 Agedashi tofu, pillowy cubes with a filigree of deep-fried crust, arrives in 
broth topped with weightless bonito flakes undulating in the steam: the tofu, 
delicately crisp on the outside, soft as custard within, is insanely 
pleasurable. When we order nasu dengaku , eggplant and shrimp, we receive nasu 
hasamiage -- eggplant with fish mousse. Explaining this to the waiter is far 
more daunting than just eating it, which is a complete delight; the fried 
eggplant has an addictive crunchy chewiness, a perfect backdrop for the 
cooling, smooth, slightly sweet fish mousse. 
</P>
<P>
 Noodles are supple, silken, full of personality. I love the thick udon in a 
soup with duck breast and an amorphous, phenomenally sticky blob of rice cake. 
Cold soba noodles, served naked on a nifty wooden slat, come with a light 
dipping sauce, scallions and ginger. More subtle are the inaniwa udon; a thin, 
seductive noodle in a lovely clear broth. Zosui , inaccurately described as a 
Japanese risotto, is more of a porridge and a bit salty; still the texture and 
an aromatic green leaf kept me spooning in. 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon-skin salad is uninspired; and a salad of fresh, lightly cooked tuna 
comes in a too-sweet miso. But a la carte fish dishes are diverse and good. 
Grilled mackerel is crisp, rich, juicy. Dramatically presented, a whole steamed 
sea bass is fluffy as clouds and topped with delicious fried chiles. 
</P>
<P>
 The perfect dessert for any and all of these dishes is the plate of fruit: 
kiwi, melon, oranges, dead-ripe strawberries. 
</P>
<P>
 * Chaco, 340 N. Camden Drive, Beverly Hills, (310) 247-1829. Lunch and dinner 
Monday through Saturday. Major credit cards. Valet parking. Beer and wine. 
Dinner for two, food only, $21 to $53.

JAZZ NOTES: MASTERS SERIES STUDIES AURAL TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Story of Jazz," the latest addition to BMG Video's Masters of American 
Music series, is a useful tool in helping the uninitiated unravel some of the 
mysteries of America's 80-year-old art form. 
</P>
<P>
 The 90-minute video, directed by Matthew Seig who also wrote it along with 
jazz journalist Chris Albertson, takes viewers from jazz's beginnings in 
ragtime through the eras of swing and be-bop up to the renaissance that is 
occurring today. 
</P>
<P>
 The video is built around interviews with musicians such as Billy Taylor, 
Dizzy Gillespie, Wynton Marsalis, Randy Weston and Wayne Shorter. Their remarks 
provide considerable insight not only into what jazz is about, but how it has 
grown and developed over the years. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also a good deal of musical performance footage, including pianist 
Willie (the Lion) Smith with a rousing stride rendition; Duke Ellington's 
orchestra playing "Mood Indigo" in the '30s; the only known clip of Charlie 
Parker appearing with Dizzy Gillespie in a 1950s TV show, playing "Hot House"; 
and Miles Davis, both with Gil Evans' orchestra and with his jazz-fusion band. 
</P>
<P>
 The video ends with the provocative statement that "jazz seems to (currently) 
be in a state of arrested development, but that doesn't lessen its 
significance. . . . It would continue to retain its importance." Many would 
argue that the fusion of jazz improvisation with various rhythmic forms, from 
hip-hip to Latin to African, is in fact resulting in a new direction for jazz 
that has only begun to be exploited. 
</P>
<P>
 That quibble aside, "The Story of Jazz" remains a first-rate addition to a 
fine collection of releases in the Masters of American Music series. Among 
other titles in the series are: "The World According to John Coltrane," 
"Thelonious Monk: American Composer," Count Basie: Swingin' the Blues," "Sarah 
Vaughan: The Divine One," and "Miles Ahead: The Music of Miles Davis." The 
series, which retails for $29.98 and $39.98 for laser disc, is available 
through Tower Video outlets and other stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Contract: Keyboard great Herbie Hancock and young trumpet star Roy 
Hargrove recently signed new recording contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock agreed to terms with Mercury/Verve. His unusual deal calls for the 
keyboardist to make pop/R&B/jazz albums for Mercury, and mainstream-leaning 
albums for Verve. 
</P>
<P>
 Hancock's first Mercury album is loosely scheduled for June, according to 
Verve's director of publicity, Jody Petlin. The as-yet-untitled album is in the 
pop-R&B direction, "with a lot of jazz," says Petlin. "It's very contemporary 
with some hip-hop beats, and Herbie plays both acoustic piano and electronic 
keyboards." Hancock's first Verve jazz album won't be out until some time in 
1995, says Petlin. 
</P>
<P>
 Hargrove's Verve debut, "When We Were One," will hit the streets in mid-May. 
The album places the trumpeter in the company of five top tenor saxophonists: 
Joe Henderson, Stanley Turrentine, Johnny Griffin, Branford Marsalis and Joshua 
Redman. The men dig into everything from Hargrove originals to the title track, 
a lush ballad by Griffin. 
</P>
<P>
 Bassist Christian McBride and trumpeter Nicholas Payton have also signed 
recently with Verve, but no first release dates have been scheduled. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue Note has been busy signing Jacky Terrason, the 1993 Thelonious Monk 
Institute International Piano Competition winner, along with saxophonists Sonny 
Fortune and Javon Jackson, trumpeter Tim Hagens and pianist Kevin Hays. No 
debut release date has been set for Terrason. Jackson, Hagens and Hays will 
have their initial albums on the streets in June as part of Blue Note's New 
Faces series. Critic's Choices: Marcus Roberts, whose performances range from 
elegant and meaningful to slightly stiff, plays solo piano Saturday in Thorne 
Hall at Occidental College. Roberts also appears Sunday at the Dunbar Hotel, as 
part of the Da Camera Society's Chamber Music in Historic Sites series. That 
concert is sold out. The historic sites series will continue in a jazz vein on 
April 24 at Union Station with a performance by Freddie Hubbard. Information: 
(310) 440-1351. . . . Madcap pianist-singer Mose Allison keeps things cooking 
at Vine Street Bar & Grill tonight and Saturday.

 Our great oceans are differently named but all run together in a vast unity 
covering nearly three quarters of the Earth's surface. No wonder they fascinate 
us as the elemental womb mother of the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 Hiroshi Sugimoto spent the last 14 years wandering the globe taking pictures 
of all this brine. He's looked at it as the Caribbean Sea from a bluff in 
Jamaica, at the English Channel from Fecamp, at the Arctic Ocean from Nordkapp. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugimoto was born in Tokyo in 1948 and works out of New York. Now his art has 
its L.A. debut as part of the Museum of Contemporary Art's ongoing "Focus" 
series. Organized by curator Kerry Brougher, the show consists of about 
two-dozen images Sugimoto derived from all his travels. 
</P>
<P>
 A reasonable person might well ask, "Why bother?" 
</P>
<P>
 The black-and-white pictures are all exactly the same size, bifurcated exactly 
in half by the horizon line. They could have been taken from the same spot on 
the same day from a camera on an affixed tripod to note the changes in light, 
tide and weather from dawn to dark. They could have been ascribed to the same 
exotic locales and nobody would be the wiser. So why go to all that trouble? 
</P>
<P>
 Well, if Sugimoto had cheated, his series would have been yet another ironic 
repetition of the idea that the camera can -- and does -- lie. That truism has 
been so oft repeated that photography, now aided by the deft manipulations of 
the computer, has grown to seem as cynical and artificial as the rest of the 
media world. 
</P>
<P>
 There is something very heartfelt about Sugimoto traipsing virtually from pole 
to pole, trying to make sure his pictures won't be mistaken for images that are 
just about themselves and their capacity to manipulate the viewer. 
</P>
<P>
 He wanted them to be about their subject, that wine-dark mystery of the 
timeless sea in conversation with the endless sky. That's the stuff of poetry 
and philosophy. It deals in questions so persistently profound and so 
fundamentally unanswerable that -- frustrated by our lack of wisdom -- we 
dismiss them as "Blue Sky." 
</P>
<P>
 We are all moved by the sea as if it had some control of our feelings. We are 
calm when it is. When it is agitated, so are we. Maybe that is because both of 
us have smooth visible surfaces that rest on uneven interior terrain. The 
bottom of the sea is not flat. It is a geography with its own Alps and chasms. 
Our inner structure is not a domesticated plain. It's a jagged terrain of 
memory as deep and unfathomable as the great waters. 
</P>
<P>
 Will anybody heed Sugimoto's invitation to honest meditation? Many a browser 
will retreat politely when their glance takes in another of those weird 
enigmatic art shows with no entertainment value. On to the Lichtenstein 
extravaganza where a person can have some fun. Who can blame them? Life is 
boring enough. 
</P>
<P>
 Those most likely to miss the point are the dedicated artniks. They will be 
too busy congratulating themselves on recognizing Sugimoto's resemblance to 
everybody from Monet to Ad Reinhardt to think about what he's trying to say. 
And who can fault that? Thinking about art excuses one from thinking about 
life. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a show for the occasional innocent who bumbles into arts sanctums with 
plenty of time and the naivete to ponder what this is really about.

THEATER BEAT: COLD WAR IS HOT AGAIN IN 'PACK OF LIES' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Wasn't it just yesterday that we celebrated the Berlin Wall's demise? Or was 
it just yesterday that Aldrich H. Ames sold Central Intelligence Agency secrets 
to Moscow? 
</P>
<P>
 The Cold War is hot again, but timing isn't what transforms the Actors Co-op's 
impeccable revival of Hugh Whitemore's 1983 espionage drama, "Pack of Lies," 
into such a spellbinding experience. 
</P>
<P>
 Like John Le Carre's novels, Whitemore's play is more than a mere spy 
thriller. And it's much more than a simple story of an ordinary family 
exploited by counterintelligence agents in the cause of national security. 
</P>
<P>
 It examines the nature of deceit, of how suspicion mutates into a dangerous 
psychological obsession. It asks a timeless question: "What's the difference 
between one lie and another?" Just as in classic Greek tragedy, global 
political struggles become family feuds. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on a true story, "Pack of Lies" is set in 1960s England. To tabloid 
journalists, this Jackson family might seem tediously normal. Scandal is 
spilled tea, adventure a teen-ager's forbidden motorcycle ride. Civil servant 
Bob (a superbly repressed Alan Johnson) likes a spot of tea after work. His 
wife, Barbara (an extraordinary Kristina Lankford), likes to pour his tea. 
Their daughter, Julie (Jennifer Manasseri, miscast), is obedient, cheerful and 
unassuming. Their best friends, the Krogers, live across the street and 
occasionally drop by. 
</P>
<P>
 That friendship ultimately ends the Jackson's domestic tranquillity. But are 
neighbors "Auntie Helen" (a richly ambiguous Sarah Rush) and her spouse (David 
Schall, equally mysterious) the problem? Or are the British Secret Service 
insinuations causing the damage? Discretions grow into deceptions. Being 
friendly at Christmas "adds to the pattern" of suspicion. Gradually, every 
innocent exchange appears freighted with ominous meaning, every simple word 
sounds like a potential lie. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Mark Henderson mutes the potential melodrama, subtly maintaining 
suspense around habitual routine. The production design is the equal of any 
Equity contract production. Tim Farmer's realistic kitchen and living room, 
Russell Pyle's suggestive lighting, and Alan Falkner's sound effects combine 
with a first-class ensemble to change the intimate Crossley Theatre into a 
house of secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Pack of Lies," Crossley Theatre, 1760 Gower St., Hollywood. 
Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 2:30 p.m. Ends March 27. $7-$12. (213) 
964-3586. Running time: 2 hours, 30 minutes. 'Hero in the House' Juggles Two 
Genres 
</P>
<P>
 For an act-and-a-half of "Hero in the House," playwright Brenda Krantz and 
director Chris DeCarlo successfully juggle genres. There's the 
marriage-in-trouble sitcom as emerging feminist wife (a compelling Suzanne 
Ford) is bored with her sofa-salesman spouse (Lee Ryan, brave in a weakly 
written role). There's the farce, as Napoleon Bonaparte returns from the Land 
of the Dead to help hubby regain command over the family. And there's even 
romantic comedy, as the resurrected Emperor courts the wife. 
</P>
<P>
 But just before reaching the climax, the Santa Monica Playhouse's fascinating 
artistic juggling act suffers a terrible accident: It tries to make sense of 
the nonsense. Until the futile attempt to inject significance, we've been 
entertained in the manner of contemporary spoofs like "I Hate Hamlet." Such a 
silly concept can provoke opportunity for outrageous comedy, as in a seduction 
scene where Napoleon's fetish for women's feet is uproariously spoofed. But 
taking this silliness seriously provokes embarrassment, not epiphanies. 
</P>
<P>
 Not even droll Nicholas Cascone's convincing portrait of Napoleon can defeat 
New Age cliches about our inner child. "Strong men express feelings" is both 
the play's message and its Waterloo. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Hero in the House," Santa Monica Playhouse, 1211 4th St., Santa Monica. 
Thursdays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7:30 p.m. Ends April 10. $16.50-$18.50. 
(310) 394-9779, Ext. 1. Running time: 2 hours. Ghost World' Fails to Haunt 
</P>
<P>
 James McClure must have a severe case of writer's block. How else are we to 
understand his latest effort, "Ghost World: The Coincidence"? A funny yet 
disturbingly derivative park-bench play, "Ghost World" resembles one of those 
glib warm-up exercises designed to oil the writer's lamp before undertaking 
more serious work. It may be McClure's homage to Samuel Beckett's "Waiting for 
Godot," but even at a mere 45 minutes the waiting feels repetitive. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet McClure is lucky at Theatre/Theater where "Ghost World" gets salvaged by 
exquisite acting and Jeff Murray's precise direction. 
</P>
<P>
 Will Utay portrays a successful playwright-screenwriter in Central Park trying 
to enjoy lunch while being shadowed by an absurd stranger in a ludicrous 
Day-Glo outfit. The stranger turns out to be Jackie Jack the Sturgeon King, a 
half-written character from one of his unfinished plays. Ritchie Montgomery 
brings Jack vividly to life with lunatic comic expressions. It's a treat to 
watch Utay and Montgomery Ping-Pong lines, but "Ghost World" is a sporadic hoot 
that fails to haunt. 
</P>
<P>
 The evening's curtain-raiser is a minor sketch by Utay called "The Agent." It, 
too, has its comic moments, thanks to the fierce performance by Howard George 
as an actors agent. It, too, is soon forgotten. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Ghost World: The Coincidence," and "The Agent," Theatre/Theater, 1713 N. 
Cahuenga Blvd., Hollywood. Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends 
April 3. $10. (213) 469-9689. Running time: 1 hour, 10 minutes. 'Doubt' 
Questions World of Artists 
</P>
<P>
 Those who witnessed the sensationally hyped 1989 staging of "Once in Doubt" at 
Los Angeles Theatre Center should be gratified by its latest revival. A spare 
production at the Nancy Silverman Gallery emphatically eliminates any lingering 
doubts about Raymond J. Barry's piece. Under Maria O'Brien's energetic 
direction, a trio of charismatic actors provides convincing proof of the play's 
staying power. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Scott Brush is the self-destructive artist struggling with the creative 
process. A devout abstract expressionist, he takes Jackson Pollock's 
drip-painting method to its logical dead end: splashing blood from his cut 
wrist over the canvas. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Joy Lind is the artist's accomplice, the wife whose rage somehow fuels 
his work. Michael Rollinson is the unsuspecting neighbor lured into the loft by 
their seductive games. Their repartee is fast, funny and demented, yet still 
manages to provoke serious questions about the art world. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Once in Doubt," Nancy Silverman Gallery, 1009 N. Madison Ave., Los Angeles. 
Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m. Ends March 14. $7. (213) 644-0955. Running time: 1 
hour, 40 minutes. Griffin's 'Voices' a Feminist Classic 
</P>
<P>
 Showcase theater has gotten a bad rap, automatically receiving dismissive 
comments from both theater professionals and critics. But sometimes 
unapologetic showcase work provides valid and valuable exposure to otherwise 
neglected plays and players. Case in point: a visiting production at the West 
Coast Ensemble of Susan Griffin's "Voices." 
</P>
<P>
 You know instantly why this show exists with a glance at the program. No 
biography of the playwright can be located. But there is extensive background 
information on each of the five actresses and the director, as well as a 
telephone number "for industry comps." 
</P>
<P>
 And yet none of that matters because Griffin's poetic examination of women's 
issues is a neglected feminist classic that rewards repeated viewings. The text 
reverberates like a musical quintet as the characters speak directly to the 
audience about their lives, weaving in-and-out of each other's stories, sewing 
a quilt of language. 
</P>
<P>
 This difficult sound collage requires a director with a conductor's touch, and 
Clair Sinnett orchestrates the voices with radio drama precision. The ensemble 
never misses a vocal beat and each actress deserves to be mentioned: Jody 
Carter, Sharon Corbett, Michelle Mikesell, Penny Peyrot, Anita Swanson. 
</P>
<P>
 But so does the playwright. After all, it's the show that best makes their 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Voices," West Coast Ensemble, 6240 Hollywood Blvd., Hollywood.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; THE KINGS: MORE THAN GYPSY TUNES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE HOCHMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a better world, everyone leaving the Gipsy Kings concert on Wednesday at 
the Pantages Theatre would have headed straight to a record store to further 
explore the wealth of musical styles brought together during the show. Maybe 
start with the North African Islamic music that's a foundation of the Gypsy 
band's flamenco-pop and can be heard clearly in singer Nicolas Reyes' raspy 
keening, or the Brazilian sambas hinted at in the percussive interplay of the 
Kings' acoustic guitar phalanx (as many as eight guitars at once). 
</P>
<P>
 But that wasn't likely, given that the success of the remarkably popular band 
seems largely based on how it homogenizes the styles rather than explores them. 
Still, the Kings did a fair share for the cause of world music in the opening 
portion of the show -- the first of four at the Pantages. A casual, intimate 
approach, with the guitarists backed by effectively subtle keyboard, bass and 
percussion, underscored the fact that this is truly Gypsy music, in the sense 
that it's pieced together from generations of nomadic life. 
</P>
<P>
 For the remainder of the show, though, the Kings turned up the bass, keyboard 
and drums and turned down the richness and passion. The music was superficially 
rousing -- the crowd stood and danced throughout -- but underneath it was bland 
and predictable, leaving the musical-cultural adventures of the opening an 
unfulfilled tease. STEVE HOCHMAN

HOME TECH / LASER BIN: 'NEW YORK' RELEASE NEEDS MORE SCORSESE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA SALTZMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A mbivalent may be the most appropriate adjective to describe Martin 
Scorsese's ambitious 1977 musical "New York, New York." That was the reaction 
of most critics and audiences 17 years ago, and it also may be the best way to 
describe MGM/UA's ambitious four-disc CAV wide-screen laser edition ($90) being 
released Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ambitious release comes complete with deleted scenes and outtakes, and a 
second analogue track with a commentary including much too little from director 
Scorsese and much too much from Philadelphia Inquirer critic Carrie Rickey 
underlying the now-2 1/2 hour-plus musical. That's the key problem of this 
otherwise flawless production. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the joys of a carefully constructed analogue track is to have the 
director comment on specific scenes as they come up on the screen. Any comment 
that has little to do with the moment at hand can be distracting and confusing. 
Even worse, the narrative track ends up competing with the film. There is no 
question that Scorsese is one of the most knowledgeable filmmakers working 
today, but too often he rambles on, saying whatever pops into his head whenever 
he thinks about it. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is chaos -- Scorsese giving the plot outline for "Blue Skies," or 
discussing some aspect of film that has nothing to do with what is being seen 
on the screen. That kind of information is better left for on-screen interviews 
at the end of the film. The producers should have sat Scorsese down in front of 
a monitor and had him comment on each scene and the creative process that went 
into each scene. If you want to see how it should be done, take a look at 
MGM/UA's "The Wizard of Oz" or Criterion's "The Player" or Fox/Image's "War of 
the Roses." 
</P>
<P>
 Since there obviously wasn't enough material from Scorsese, the producers 
include Rickey's comments that are scene-specific, but that offer nothing more 
than a simplistic and often pompous account of plot and character. Often this 
is insulting to the viewer and does little to replace the specific insights the 
director can offer. 
</P>
<P>
 The laser disc release includes the movie-within-a-movie number, "Happy 
Endings" (with Larry Kert), taken out of the film in 1977 for time and 
reinserted in 1981. Also part of the package is the intelligent teaser-trailer 
imaginatively framed around the Kander-Ebb signature song "New York, New York," 
as well as the original theatrical trailer, different in tone and touch, which 
makes for an interesting contrast. In addition, there are publicity materials, 
including beautiful stills in both color and black-and-white, and the initial 
script by Earl MacRauch and Mardik Martin, from which Scorsese and actors 
Robert De Niro and Liza Minnelli worked. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading the script shows how Scorsese and his actors improvised much of the 
film. Surprisingly, the original script has a happier ending -- De Niro and 
Minnelli walk off into New York City hand in hand. Thrown into the outtakes are 
two scenes that Scorsese shot of that happier ending before he decided to go 
with the more bittersweet finale.

NATIONAL VIDEO RENTALS ; SUSPENSE EDGES OUT 'SLEEPLESS' 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Once the romantic glow of Valentine's Day faded, so did "Sleepless in 
Seattle." Rentals briefly shot "Sleepless" into the top spot, but this week it 
slipped to No. 4.Seems renters are in an action/suspense mood these days, with 
four out of Top Five falling into that category. "In the Line of Fire," with 
John Malkovich's Oscar-nominated performance, moved to the top. "Last Action 
Hero" seems to have peaked, slipping a notch to No. 3--it's attracted 
considerable renter interest, in spite of its disappointing box-office 
performance, but has nowhere near the appeal of the usual Schwarzenegger action 
movie. The college-football drama "The Program," notorious for its macho, 
lying-in-the-road sequence (not included in the rental video), debuted at No. 
20. So far, "The Real McCoy," starring Kim Basinger, is no blockbuster, moving 
up just two notches to No. 19.  
</P>
<P>
 * In his directorial debut, Mel Gibson also stars, playing against his image, 
in "The Man Without a Face." This quiet little drama about a recluse with a 
scarred face, didn't earn Gibsonesque box-office numbers--its $23.1 million is 
about as much as a "Lethal Weapon" movie would make in its first week or so. 
The video opened at No. 14 and Gibson's star power should easily make it a Top 
10 rental--maybe even Top Five. Source: Billboard Publications Inc. 03,29,06,08

POP ALBUM CHART; GOOD HEAVENS! A 'SIGN' DISCO IS BACK

<TEXT>

 Is "The Sign" a sign of the times--that disco is rising from the grave? That's 
what disco die-hards are saying about Ace of Base's danceable album, which 
climbed from No. 9 to No. 3 on the pop chart. Some fans are buying it for the 
title song, which danced to the top of the pop singles chart. The Swedish 
group's album also includes its smash single from half a year ago, "All That 
She Wants," which is still selling (No. 24 on the pop singles chart). R. Kelly, 
who specializes in steamy songs, is bumping and grinding his way to the top of 
the charts. His "Bump 'n' Grind" single is No. 6 on the pop chart and his 
album, "12 Play," is No. 2. Tom Petty's "Greatest Hits" continues to be a 
strong seller (No. 9), thanks to a hit single "Mary Jane's Last Dance." Crash 
Test Dummies' "God Shuffled His Feet" jumped from No. 32 to No. 21 and seems 
destined for the Top 10. 
</P>
<P>
 * The soundtrack from the Winona Ryder movie is bounding up the chart, this 
week leaping from No. 57 to No. 17. The Knack's old "My Sharona" is one of the 
album's big songs, as well as Big Mountain's remake of Peter Frampton's "Baby, 
I Love Your Way." The soundtrack also features songs by U2, World Party and 
Dinosaur Jr.

THEATER REVIEW; EAST WEST 'MAIDS' A CLINICAL, SOLID OUTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD STAYTON, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "Skip the prelude," the servant elegantly commands. "Start the insults." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Welcome to "The Maids," Jean Genet's 1947 slap-in-the-face masterpiece. A 
seminal classic of French existentialism, the challenging text can still shock 
and insult polite society, as demonstrated in an impressive revival at East 
West Players. However, Genet's politically incorrect domestics with their 
sadomasochistic games can also resist empathy and arouse ennui, depending on 
how they're directed. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Alberto Isaac has chosen to faithfully strive for Genet's goal of a 
highly theatrical ceremony. When Madame is away, the maids play secret games in 
her bedroom, taking turns being master or slave. Sometimes the declamatory 
style resembles a Racine tragedy; at others, a Kabuki pantomime. But a 
difficult, delicate balance between ritual and realism must be maintained. If 
the maid's murderous schemes aren't believable, then tension dissolves into 
tedium. Isaac's restraint is admirable but somewhat bloodless. The drama flows 
from the intellect, not the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 And here style is character. But Emily Kuroda and Jeanne Sakata are superbly 
disciplined performers whose every gesture conveys a lifetime of abuse and 
self-denial. They become quintessential servants, the invisible messengers 
barely noticed in the background of countless movies. When Madame is present, 
their downcast eyes and whispered answers are devoid of emotion. But when 
Madame is away, their voices rage and their gestures turn epic. However, even 
when alone they resemble cadavers on display, hollow, drained by servitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Ayame Thomson's Madame is appropriately opposite in performance 
style. Her interpretation is burlesque, resembling a self-absorbed queen 
oblivious to her domestics. It's a more entertaining approach, but precarious 
in the context of this formal production. Rather than stepping from another 
class, this Madame sometimes seems like a fugitive from another play. 
</P>
<P>
 The stage is bordered by footlights, like a Boulevard comedy (and lit 
exquisitely by Rae Creevey), while the bedroom is impeccably detailed in 
funereal black-and-white tones by designer Francois Chau.

 There is no hint of social protest, no easy outrage over Asian Americans 
working at minimum wage for a selfish exploiter. Rich or poor, these women 
would remain obsessed with dangerous games. Missing is Genet's religious 
fervor. It's a cold dance of death. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, lured by Genet's vision, we can't take our eyes off this hypnotic 
autopsy.

HOME TECH / CD CORNER: 'JACKIE WILSON' OFFERS A SMALL, SWEET DEAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT HILBURN, TIMES POP MUSIC CRITIC 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 "The Very Best of Jackie Wilson" is the latest dividend in a series of CD 
compilations that offers much of the quality of a box set at a mid-line price. 
</P>
<P>
 Box sets are a collector's dream because the multi-disc packages give you a 
comprehensive look at an artist's work, plus illustrated booklets that contain 
essays and other historical information. 
</P>
<P>
 But what if you don't want 50 or more selections by a particular artist at a 
price between $30 and $50? 
</P>
<P>
 The alternative has generally been skimpy, single-disc "best of" packages with 
only 10 to 12 songs and the barest of accompanying information. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rhino Records' single-disc series features 16 songs and a mini-essay -- 
all for around $11. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to offer the casual fan a series featuring top-of-the-line 
sound, song selection and packaging," said Gary Stewart, who is vice president 
of A&R at the label. 
</P>
<P>
 "Many of the early 'best of' titles in the industry were simply transferred to 
CD from the old vinyl format," he added, "with no thought given to expanding 
and revising track selection, updating sound quality or adding historical 
perspective." 
</P>
<P>
 Rhino began moving toward this upgraded approach in late 1992 after entering 
into an arrangement with Atlantic Records to manage Atlantic's catalogue 
reissues. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of 1994, the label expects to have more than 20 titles in the 
mid-level series. Among the titles already available: "Very Best of" entries by 
the Drifters, the Rascals, Wilson Pickett and the Spinners. Among those to 
come: two volumes on Aretha Franklin, the Coasters and Manhattan Transfer. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jackie Wilson CD contains 16 songs, including such signature hits as 
"Lonely Teardrops," "Baby Workout," "Doggin' Around" and "(Your Love Keeps 
Lifting Me) Higher and Higher." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides being a gifted singer, Wilson was also a dynamic performer whose 
stylish dancing may have been as much an influence on such contemporary figures 
as Prince and Terence Trent D'Arby as James Brown's was. 
</P>
<P>
 In an accompanying essay, Robert Pruter, R&B editor of Goldmine magazine, 
focuses on that dancing. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one could forget the way Wilson floated across the stage," he writes. 
"Without missing a beat or note, he would perform elegant steps, classy spins, 
and at a high point do a crowd-pleasing split, lowering himself to the stage." 
</P>
<P>
 The vitality of those performances made the final years of Wilson's life all 
the more disheartening. After a heart attack in 1975, Wilson lay in a 
semi-comatose state for nine years before his death.

THEATER REVIEW; TV NOSTALGIA STIRS IN 'LET HIM SLEEP'; THE BREA THEATRE LEAGUE 
TUNES INTO THE AURA, TONE AND FLAVOR OF THE VERY SORT OF EARLY '50S SITCOM THAT 
PEG KEHRET'S COMEDY RECALLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 At the beginning of the Brea Theatre League's production of Peg Kehret's "Let 
Him Sleep 'Till It's Time for His Funeral," an obviously beleaguered television 
floor manager comes out and sets up the audience for a live broadcast of the 
popular "Sudsy Comedy Hour." An opening announcement is made over appropriately 
banal music, and a vocal group pipes an equally innocuous commercial for the 
sponsor, Sudsy Soap. 
</P>
<P>
 There's no indication in the program whether this setup was the playwright's 
idea. If it was, it provided her with a clever way to evoke the aura, tone and 
flavor of the very sort of early '50s sitcom that her play essentially is. If 
this was director Pattric Walker's inspiration, he found a sure way to make a 
dated and overly convoluted comedy work well. 
</P>
<P>
 Kehret has given us pretty insignificant froth about mistaken intentions, 
misinterpreted clues and skewed conclusions. Edna Dollefson frets over husband 
Harold's fear and anger at his approaching 50th birthday, plans a surprise 
premature funeral instead of a conventional party and invites all Harold's 
friends and co-workers so he can realize how loved and needed he is. 
</P>
<P>
 Harold discovers her notes about renting the funeral home, buying the casket, 
etc., and thinks she's planning to have him murdered for his insurance money. 
When Edna finds his one-way escape ticket to Mexico, she thinks he's meeting an 
inamorata south of the border. Sound like "I Love Lucy" or any of the other 
improbable early sitcoms that spawned today's equally improbable descendants? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 If Kehret meant it as an affectionate spoof, it works -- but only because 
director Walker means it that way too. His action is fast and furious, and 
about as surface as it can be. He doesn't allow his actors to take things too 
seriously. They certainly are serious in their manner, though, or the comedy 
wouldn't be there. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Neubauer as Edna and Jaye Wilson as her buddy Mille believe every moment. 
Gordon Marhoefer scores with his forthright sincerity as Mille's husband and 
Harold's best friend. Along with Ross Burton, as the representative of a 
"Heart's Desire Contest," they make all this really look like the kind of 
nonsense that kept America home 40 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Dan Rodgers as Harold and Leanna Rodgers as the Dollefson's 
contest-obsessed daughter allow themselves to go over the genre's limit, 
mugging and amplifying the comedy to little avail. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Walker's sense of style is impeccable, and if the one joke that keeps 
the whole thing together has begun to flag by the end, the energy with which 
Walker fuels it keeps it charming and often funny. 
</P>

THEATER REVIEW; 'RAINMAKER' CONJURES ERA OF IMAGINATION, DREAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We tend to love the con man, especially the traveling kind. Take Bill 
Starbuck. He strolls onto the drought-plagued Curry farm, spouts off like a 
Pentecostal preacher and promises he can bring rain in 24 hours. Nobody really 
buys his yarn in "The Rainmaker," N. Richard Nash's play that opened last 
weekend in a wobbly production at the Ensemble Theatre, but they're willing to 
take a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 For $100, they'll listen to his banter and bragging, his dreams and delights. 
Starbuck may not be able to bring rain, but he is pretty good at bringing a 
little excitement into the Currys' dull lives. He's especially good at juicing 
up Lizzie, the plain daughter resigned to spinsterhood. Her happy-ending 
evolution into an assured woman with options, including marriage, is gussied up 
like a gift from Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Rainmaker" was popular when it premiered in New York City in 1954; a film 
two years later, with Burt Lancaster in one of his more flamboyant roles as 
Starbuck, was also a success. These days, though, Nash's play can come across 
as a stagy bucket of corn, all melodrama and sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 Its lessons -- that it's important to have dreams, and that the imagination is 
a world unto itself -- are good ones, but Nash certainly doesn't offer them 
subtly. And women will probably cringe at Lizzie's predicament: Her ordinary 
looks (not-so-pretty face, bulky bod) are what everybody keeps fretting over. 
All the men agree that she does have her talents, however -- she's a great cook 
and housekeeper. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh well, it was a different time, and the play may be appreciated by some as a 
period piece. Director Herman Boodman clearly is aware that the story takes 
place at the turn of the century. With the help of set designer David Billman 
(who plays Starbuck) and costumer Andrew Otaro, he has given the small 
theater's stage an authentic, rough-hewn appearance. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Performances are uneven, but Rhesa Casaday stands out as Lizzie, conveying 
self-awareness of the character's handicaps and what they mean to her future, 
and the well of inner strength that lets the audience know that Lizzie can 
overcome any problems that pop up. 
</P>
<P>
 Casaday is fairly restrained, something that can't be said of Billman. His 
scenery-gobbling moves as Starbuck actually are sort of fun; you can't help but 
like his brashness, his bellowing voice, his king-size visions of what life can 
be. But there's something missing in the characterization. Billman just isn't 
persuasive enough. He has style, but too little charisma.

THEATER / JAN HERMAN; 'TWENTY-ONE' QUESTIONS; 'NIGHT AND HER STARS,' PREMIERING 
TONIGHT AT SCR, USES '50S GAME-SHOW SCANDAL TO EXAMINE SOCIETY'S OBSESSION WITH 
WINNERS AND LOSERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Walt Whitman heard America singing. Dan Enright hears America wanting. The 
time is the late '50s. The place is network television. The mood is prophetic. 
</P>
<P>
 America craves "the cash, the fridge, the camper, the car." But those are just 
appetizers. What America really hungers for is a main dish to envy and adore. 
</P>
<P>
 As the producer of "Twenty-One," NBC's answer to "The $64,000 Question" and 
"The $64,000 Challenge" on CBS, Enright is only too happy to appease the 
nation's hunger and the insistent demands of his sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
 He will supply that dishiest of dishes, a winning contestant who is "tall, 
graceful, brilliant, virile" and, perhaps most important, "deserving." 
</P>
<P>
 So begins Richard Greenberg's latest play, "Night and Her Stars," about the 
secretly rigged quiz shows that enthralled the public with get-rich fantasies 
during TV's cynical adolescence. It opens tonight, a world premiere on the 
South Coast Repertory Mainstage in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg, 35, is too young to remember the shows themselves or the scandal 
that burst their bubble. But his play sets out the essential facts, making use 
of real-life figures and raising serious questions about a society that feeds 
on the titillation of winners and losers cast as heroes and villains. 
</P>
<P>
 "I became interested in the subject because of the way people were enlisted to 
act out a pre-existing scenario," Greenberg recalled during a recent interview 
at the theater. "Instead of being part of a game, in which anybody could win 
based on skill, they had to enact a drama with predetermined roles." 
</P>
<P>
 The two most celebrated Enright recruits were Charles Van Doren and Herb 
Stempel, both plucked from obscurity and pitted against each other on 
"Twenty-One" in a bogus but dazzling showdown. Each was coached to make it look 
like a victory of the good guy over the bad guy. 
</P>
<P>
 Stempel, the show's reigning champ, was a short, stocky former GI who dreamed 
of becoming an actor and was working his way through graduate school at New 
York's City College. But for all his winnings, viewers were not smitten by him. 
He looked uncomfortable in clothes that didn't fit. He had a bad haircut. Far 
from inspiring confidence in the common man with a seemingly infinite fund of 
knowledge, he offered the unappealing image of a bundle of nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Enright decided Stempel would serve the show better as a loser. Van Doren was 
brought on to defeat the unlikable champ. 
</P>
<P>
 Tall, handsome and modest, Van Doren looked elegant and sounded 
self-deprecating -- everything you'd want in an Ivy League college instructor, 
especially one who came from a distinguished intellectual family. Not 
surprisingly, Van Doren was an overnight sensation. He spent 15 consecutive 
weeks on "Twenty-One," became a cultural icon and made the cover of Time 
magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 But as the Nancy Kerrigan-Tonya Harding saga so recently has reminded us, a 
national obsession with symbolic heroes and villains can have unexpected 
consequences. Stempel, who resented his inglorious treatment, became Van 
Doren's nemesis in reality. He went to the authorities and told what he knew, 
not so much to exonerate himself as to tarnish Van Doren. 
</P>
<P>
 "People didn't really care about Herb Stempel," Greenberg said. "He was seen 
as this terrible little man who envied Charles Van Doren and got angry that he 
didn't make as much money. So he created a lot of trouble." 
</P>
<P>
 When people found out the quiz shows were rigged, even down to such details as 
telling contestants when to hesitate or mop their brows, they were deeply 
shocked. Yet Van Doren maintained such an aura of innocence that his heroic 
status seemed untouched by the revelations. 
</P>
<P>
 Oddly, the playwright never had any particular interest in the quiz shows or 
the scandal that set off a congressional investigation. He only discovered the 
subject by accident a few years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was watching TV and saw the last 15 minutes of this documentary about what 
had happened. I was just killing time. I still haven't seen any more than that 
snippet. But I thought, 'These are my characters!' Charles Van Doren and Herb 
Stempel had the sort of antimony I'm always writing about." 
</P>
<P>
 Odder still, Greenberg believed at first that the subject would make great 
material for a musical. He and William Finn, the Tony Award-winning composer, 
were looking to do one together "and we needed a topic," Greenberg explained. 
"This was big. It had color, size." But they couldn't come to a meeting of 
minds. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill always wanted to do stuff I wasn't interested in. I always wanted to do 
stuff he wasn't interested in. He would suggest frothy, high-class farces. I 
would think, 'Please, never again as long as I live.' I would say things like, 
'Why don't we do "Goodbye, Columbus?" And he would say, 'I've written it 
already. It's called "Falsettos." ' 
</P>
<P>
 "So I wrote a few pages of this. Bill even set them (to music). Time passed. 
Then he said, 'There's no love story.' I was grateful, because by then I'd 
become so interested I wanted to be responsible for the whole thing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Once Greenberg began looking into the subject, he decided to do what he calls 
"ambient research." He drenched himself in the Zeitgeist of the '50s. Rather 
than load up on videos of the quiz shows or documentaries about them, he read 
reams of literature from the period. He took a special interest in the writings 
of the poet and critic Mark Van Doren, Charles' father. 
</P>
<P>
 But one thing that especially set Greenberg off was Charles Van Doren's own 
view of the quiz shows. A somewhat reclusive figure who to this day has never 
said much about them in public, Van Doren wrote an article for Life magazine 
some six months after his starring role on "Twenty-One," well before the 
scandal hit. 
</P>
<P>
 "You see him distancing himself from the quiz shows," Greenberg said. "He says 
the information on the shows doesn't count as real knowledge. He says real 
knowledge is more baffling and complex. It's curious, because he talks about 
the experience of the quiz show contestant abstractly, but it feels strangely 
confessional. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says, 'To the quiz show contestant, all is certainty. No questions are 
asked except those that have answers. And those answers are held on the cards 
in the emcee's hand.' You can't help thinking, 'If you hadn't been fixed, 
Charles, would it have been so certain to you?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Van Doren went so far as to suggest an outlandish theory of brain function 
that enabled the contestants to store encyclopedic amounts of data. In essence, 
he theorized that they created space in their brains for new data by erasing 
old data. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems so sadly, hideously ironic," Greenberg said. "Here was this man who 
was supposed to be promulgating a love of knowledge. That was one of his 
rationalizations. And he had submitted to this completely instrumental use of 
knowledge, this vulgarization of it, even using it as his defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why an investigator says to him, 'Do you ever miss what you've 
forgotten?' It shocks Van Doren for a moment into an awareness of what he has 
become." 
</P>
<P>
 And what of Stempel? 
</P>
<P>
 He never became an actor. But part of his Hollywood dream did come true. 
Nearly four decades after his appearance on "Twenty-One," he served as a 
consultant on the new movie "Quiz Show," directed by Robert Redford and due in 
September from Disney.

THEATER REVIEW; 'ORANGEFELD' MAKES UP NOTHING; A MOSTLY NEW BATCH OF CRAZIES 
DOES SOMETHING WITH A 'SEINFELD' SENDUP AND NEWS SATIRE, BUT ITS IMPROV IS 
WEAK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Just reading the papers and checking out the TV news and tabloid shows should 
tell you. But there's something about going to a comedy sketch show like the 
kind that the Orange County Crazies specialize in that really makes you realize 
that these are kooky times. (Even Dennis Miller, he of the Olympian demeanor, 
was shaking his head about current events on the "Letterman" show this week.) 
</P>
<P>
 Comics must be salivating these days with Tonya and Nancy and Lorena and Eric 
and Lyle and Michael to play with, and watching the Crazies' new show, 
"Orangefeld," is a good way to see a lot of the topical nonsense sifted and 
reshaped. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crazies have also reshaped themselves: With five new company members 
(Patty DeBaun, Phil Fleischmann, Patsy Fung, Kevin Peralez and young Lindsay 
Marie Verbage) and a few more recently added (Tom Collins, Carmen Garduno, Guy 
Nelson and Don Wood), it's almost an entirely new group from this time last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The freshness shows, in every sense. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps as an indication that the Sturm und Drang of recent tabloidized news 
is actually lighter than air, the running skit theme is a takeoff on 
"Seinfeld," and how the show's situations are essentially based on nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 For all its cleverness and cheeky smarts, "Seinfeld" is the perfect sitcom 
match for TonyaNews reality, in which New York Times reporters actually debate 
figure skating in prime time. 
</P>
<P>
 The Crazies push this only so far. Each "Seinfeld" skit segment uses audience 
suggestions but otherwise sticks closely to the original, from musical director 
Tom Zink's dead-on simulation of the show's thumpy music to some good casting 
(especially Garduno as Elaine). 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Halasz is no Kramer (there's more to Kramer than mere clumsiness), but 
Collins' George and Nelson's Jerry replicate these pals' weekly clashes. 
</P>
<P>
 What's grating is that the same joke -- playing on Jerry's line, "Why not make 
something out of nothing?" -- is repeated sketch after sketch. Two or three 
scenes of this is fine; six is relentless. And when topics and audience ideas 
(such as the Laguna fire) are inserted into the scenes, the action stops cold, 
a reminder that -- new or old -- this has never been a strong improv group. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a stronger idea group, deeply ingrained in tube culture. Some of the best 
skits ape and update classic TV, from a funny "Leave It to Menendez," to a 
"Twilight Zone" parody of corporate lying and a Vietnamese "Honeymooners" ("The 
Hong-Nguyen Mooners"). This last bit introduces a new, interesting twist in 
ethnic comedy, in which two Latino actors (Rich Flin and Garduno) play 
Vietnamese -- although Garduno is far more attuned to speaking a deliberately 
pig-Latin Vietnamese than Flin. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's marriage of current affairs with TV extends, of course, to 
infomercials (the funniest being Garduno's crazed Lorena Bobbitt hawking a 
slice-and-dice machine and Nelson pitching windup "kid companions," played by 
Verbage and Drake Doremus.) 
</P>
<P>
 The usual music-video segments are as smart as ever: Flin as Michael Jackson 
bemoaning his recent problems in "Had" and Derrick Henderson as Snoop Doggy 
Dogg singing "Scoop Doggy Poop" to a weak rap beat. 
</P>
<P>
 Two second-act, all-ensemble pieces range, under Cherie Kerr's direction, from 
an uncontrollably messy parody of an Orange County community meeting to a 
sometimes hilariously funny sendup of popsters benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 In this case, it's "Voice Aid," calling for cash to pay medical costs for the 
strained and shot voices of everyone from Springsteen to Yoko Ono (Fung, in the 
surprise of the evening). At times like this, the Crazies confidently shove a 
sharp satirical sword into bloated cultural icons, doing the job clowns are 
meant to do.

THEATER REVIEW; 'WILD HEARTS' OPENS VENUE AT BREWERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Venue is a new performance space in the Brewery, an artists' colony that 
has taken over a sprawling former brewery just northeast of downtown Los 
Angeles. It's an extremely urban-looking site. But the Venue is opening with a 
couple of productions about the Wild West. 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend show, "Wild Hearts," is a quartet of mostly two-character scenes 
by Rita Sioux Lilly. Despite the writer's name, they have nothing to do with 
Native Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Only one of the vignettes begins to rise above the level of an acting 
exercise. It features Diana Bellamy as a pregnant woman traveling west. Through 
a series of monologues that precede or follow the other playlets on the bill, 
we gradually see the woman's conditions going from bad to worse. Finally, her 
closing scene with a grave-digger (Daniel Riordan) serves as a fitting epitaph 
on the heroic struggles of the women who journeyed westward. 
</P>
<P>
 Bellamy's performance matches the dimensions of the role. She also does a sly 
turn as Belle (the name is evidence of the danger for stereotype here), the 
feisty proprietor of a saloon in a deserted mining camp who encounters romance 
in the form of an itinerant trapper (Jerry Wayne Bernard). This scene is cute 
but predictable. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Randol-Smith and Riordan share an even more predictable scene about an 
Irish washerwoman and the American soldier who done her wrong. But the worst 
scene comes earlier: a confrontation between an outlaw -- who's tiresome in her 
attempts to outrage -- and an aging sheriff. This one is most notable for the 
haziness of its exposition, including its purposefully opaque ending. 
</P>
<P>
 Allison Liddi directed with too generous a hand. As women-in-the-West shows 
go, this one can't keep up with the likes of "Going to See the Elephant" or 
"Abundance." Another show, "Movin' West," plays on Tuesdays and Wednesdays. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Wild Hearts," The Venue, 600 Moulton Ave., Studio 103-B, Los Angeles. 
Fridays-Saturdays, 8 p.m.; Sundays, 7 p.m. Ends April 24. $15.50-$17.50. (213)

'LOVE IN THE RUINS' EXPLORES THE IMPACT OF TENSIONS IN L.A.; ART: EXHIBIT IN 
LONG BEACH FOCUSES ON THE INSPIRING ASPECTS, FROM ETHNIC COMPLEXITY TO TECTONIC 
INSTABILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Riots, fires, floods, earthquake, 5,000 aftershocks. Max Almy and Teri Yarbrow 
of Encino have had no shortage of raw material for their newest artwork about 
life in a troubled urban paradise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely been inspiring," Almy says wryly. 
</P>
<P>
 "Utopia," the artists' interactive installation, features a darkly ironic, 
metaphoric video game in which players make high-stakes decisions while viewing 
footage of Los Angeles' yin and yang: Its blue swimming pools, palm trees and 
swanky shops; its homeless people, choked freeways, the recent fires, the 
Reginald O. Denny beating. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is part of "Love in the Ruins: Art and the Inspiration of L.A.," a 
multimedia group exhibit at Long Beach Museum of Art, which attempts to show 
the impact on 23 artists of L.A.'s multifaceted nature, from its evolving 
ethnic complexity to its tectonic instability. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't interested in identifying some kind of regional sensibility or 
style," said Long Beach museum curator Noriko Gamblin, who organized the 
exhibit. "I was interested in how the artists had internalized certain aspects 
of L.A.'s culture or environment and how that was showing in their work." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the show's artists now live or have spent long periods of time in L.A. 
Despite the premise of the show, however, not all are convinced that fact has 
shaped their creative output. 
</P>
<P>
 John Baldessari, the exhibit's elder statesman, hedged his bets. During a 
recent interview at the Santa Monica studio where he's worked for nearly a 
quarter of a century, the pioneering Conceptual artist said he "can't see" how 
or where his work reflects or is inspired by L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Two Chests: Heart and Soul," a previously unexhibited 1991 piece included 
here, a photograph featuring a bare-chested woman is placed above a photograph 
of a bare-chested man who appears to be lying in a hospital bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Both the man's face and woman's face are obscured, in typical Baldessari 
fashion, and both photographs are movie stills, which Baldessari has used for 
decades -- but never chosen for content or connection to Hollywood, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just that I wanted to find cheaply available photographs," said the 
artist, 62. "They could have been of anything. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always tend to think I could do my work anywhere," he said. "But, how does 
one know? There's no way to do a control experiment. I mean, I've seen other 
people change (their work when they leave L.A.), but I've seen other people not 
change. So, I just don't know." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Hudson of Sherman Oaks isn't so sure of L.A.'s effect either. A 
light-and-space artist who has constructed for the exhibit "Separate Spaces," a 
sight-specific work composed of a wafer-thin, suspended plexiglass sheet that 
divides one of the museum's galleries in half, she said recently that she's 
been keenly aware of L.A.'s "expansive space." 
</P>
<P>
 "When I'm driving on the freeways, I'm always mapping out how big the space in 
front of me is," she said. "When I'm in New York, I have to look up to see if 
the sky is still there between the tall buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Hudson said, she's chiefly interested in how her work transforms the 
light or space around it -- rather than drawing attention to the work itself -- 
thus her raw materials of light and space are obviously not linked to any of 
the cities, including L.A., in which she's worked. Nor, she said, has L.A.'s 
constant state of flux, both social and geographic, factored into her creative 
process. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just so happens that my work is extremely fragile and sometimes transient, 
both literally and conceptually, but I don't see that in relationship to L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 Almy and Yarbrow, who have lived in the city for more than a decade, do see 
clear-cut links. 
</P>
<P>
 The collaborators describe their piece as a nonliteral "conceptual poem," in 
which players must make split-second "ethical choices" by pulling the trigger 
of the gun to select one word from each of several dichotomous word-pairs 
briefly superimposed over the video's fast-paced photo montage. 
</P>
<P>
 The word pairs represent moral conundrums bombarding urban dwellers -- 
Obsession/Gratification, Inclusion/Exclusion, Progress/Decline -- or L.A.'s 
dual identity as sun-drenched Eden and land of natural disasters -- 
Order/Chaos, Heaven/Hell, Paradise/Utopia. Performance artist Rachel Rosenthal 
appears on screen to encourage players and assess their performance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I almost have to live in a place like this," Almy said, "because I'm very 
interested in the contemporary dilemma. L.A. is where you feel those tensions." 
</P>
<P>
 Adds Yarbrow, whose large round paintings of roiling magma -- symbolizing both 
psychic and geologic turbulence -- flank the installation: "The only other 
place I'd like to live is Santorini, a Greek island that is also prone to 
earthquakes and has two active volcanoes." 
</P>
<P>
 L.A. has likewise been a persuasive muse for painter Steven Criqui, who makes 
social commentary about such subjects as personal responsibility with his 
quirky, abstract depictions of the city's buildings, plants and signage. 
</P>
<P>
 The exhibit's youngest artist at 30, Criqui said he's been fascinated by this 
"built environment" since 1976, when he moved from the East to Southern 
California with his family. 
</P>
<P>
 "We pulled up into the driveway of this tract home in Orange County in our 
Ford station wagon," said the Santa Monica resident, "and I just couldn't 
believe how banal and ugly the building was." 
</P>
<P>
 Raised in an environment that, unlike much of Southern California, had more 
greenery than steel, stucco and concrete, he's been trying to make sense of 
various aspects of L.A.'s "practice of artifice" and "creation of fantasy" ever 
since. Home to Hollywood, theme parks galore and a powerful advertising 
industry, "L.A. is the magic kingdom" of all that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love the imaginative quality of all of it," Criqui said, "and I'm not 
looking down at it. There's this really rich iconography out there that says a 
lot about our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 * "Love in the Ruins: Art and the Inspiration of L.A." runs through May 22 at 
Long Beach Museum of Art, 2300 E. Ocean Blvd., Long Beach. Hours are Wednesdays 
through Sundays, 10 a.m . -5 p.m.; until 8 p.m. on Fridays. Admission, $1-$2.

 Grown-ups, don't try this: A few weeks ago we published a drawing of 
Beckjord's Cube, an earthquake protection bed with a pipe frame. We thought it 
was the end to our fears of living in seismic California. 
</P>
<P>
 The inventor, Jon Erik Beckjord, had been inspired by a story saying that 
actor Jerry Van Dyke apparently survived the 6.8 quake "due to (a) four-posted 
bed that propped up his falling room." 
</P>
<P>
 We had no reason to doubt the scientific credentials of Beckjord because he 
is, after all, the curator of the Crypto-Phenomena Bigfoot Museum in . . . 
well, it's currently homeless. Anyway, Beckjord offered the design for free. 
</P>
<P>
 Alas, now we hear from Grant High math teacher Harold Jacobs that "Beckjord's 
cube is not as practical as it might seem." Jacobs points out that 
"quadrilaterals, unlike triangles, are not rigid. Consequently, a cube made 
without any triangular braces has no real strength." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that it would make any difference to Bigfoot. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A hardcover Only: Jacobs, by the way, is the author of the textbook, 
"Mathematics: A Human Endeavor," which, we're proud to say, contains a mistake 
that first appeared in this column. No, it wasn't the time we mixed up a 
cockapoo with a cockatoo. This was a photo by reader Al MacInnes that showed 
the word only spelled with a reversed N on the pavement of a freeway off-ramp. 
Only in L.A. took it personally. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 This should be an exhibit in the Temporary Contemporary Museum: Edward Conklin 
notes that a never-say-die sign in Hermosa Beach just celebrated the eighth 
anniversary of the date on which it was supposed to be removed.

 Training for bras: We phoned up a Northern California artist named Nicolino to 
see how he was progressing on his majestic plan to stretch 10,000 bras across 
the Grand Canyon. There have been a few hitches, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolino, you may recall, traveled by train from San Francisco to L.A. to El 
Paso in December, asking for donations of bras at each stop. His artwork is 
intended to be a spoof on the preoccupation of Americans with their bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, he has amassed only 2,000 pieces of lingerie so far. (In case 
you were wondering, none of them appears to be the Madonna bustier that was 
stolen from Frederick's of Hollywood during the L.A. riots of 1992.) 
</P>
<P>
 Nicolino is planning once again to "whistle-stop for bras," as he puts it, 
pulling into L.A. near the end of April. 
</P>
<P>
 Although hundreds of people greeted him with bras in El Paso last time, 
Nicolino picked up only three during a two-hour stopover in L.A. He has a 
theory about that. "There's less to do in El Paso," Nicolino said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Not such a Grand idea: This just in! A fax from Nicolino announces: "After 
discussing this project with the Grand Canyon National park officials, Nicolino 
is now exploring an ALTERNATE PROJECT SITE. The project is becoming 
increasingly problematic . . . jeopardizing a successful permitting process." 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps our readers can offer, by letter or fax, (213) 237-4712, a site in 
L.A.

 * Thank you for the thoughtful editorial (Feb. 22) on uniform requirements for 
our schools. I think there is no question that we would see an immediate 
benefit in attitude and safe passage to and from campus. 
</P>
<P>
 If the remaining question is one of costs, I have what I feel is a realistic 
solution. We have always let license plates be made in our prisons, so why not 
move in some sewing machines? Just think, former gang members making clothing 
to preclude their younger siblings from joining them. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another beneficial byproduct. We would be offering training in the 
clothing industry for employment after their parole. This could serve to bring 
back some employment we currently lose to other labor forces. So far, I have 
never seen a master license plate maker gain work in the private sector.

MASSACRE IN MOSQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tragic events in Hebron on Feb. 25 mark a black day in the history of the 
Middle East. In the first instance this atrocity is, of course, a tragedy for 
the Palestinian people, but it is also a tragedy for the Jewish people. While 
some may attempt to depict the perpetrator as irrational and capricious, it is 
reasonable to assume that Baruch Goldstein operated with a clear understanding 
of the human scale and the historical significance of his horrendous deed. 
</P>
<P>
 First by choosing to act on the Jewish holiday of Purim, Goldstein was 
distorting the historical legacy and meaning of that festival. The scroll of 
Esther relates that on this day the Jews of Persia were empowered to defend 
themselves from the threat of annihilation. Goldstein exploited this account to 
justify his wanton destruction of the lives of scores of innocent victims -- 
worshipers in a sacred place on a sacred day. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, by choosing to undertake this massacre in Hebron, Goldstein was 
desecrating the memory of the Jewish martyrs of that city, themselves religious 
men and women who were mercilessly slaughtered in 1929 while preparing for the 
onset of the Shabbat. Although he may have thought himself an avenger of the 
1929 pogrom, Goldstein in fact was endangering the lives of Jews, Muslims and 
Christians in the Middle East, and undermining the prospects for peaceful 
coexistence in that region.

 * The massacre of Arabs at prayer in the mosque at Hebron by an Israeli 
settler -- and the continuing slaughter of Arabs by Israeli soldiers in the 
aftermath of the massacre -- may have been triggered by the act of a lone 
Jewish terrorist. But this horror is unquestionably the direct result of 
Israel's illegal occupation of Arab lands. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the ugliest of reminders that the true obstacle to peace in the West 
Bank and Gaza remains the Israeli occupation and, particularly, Israel's policy 
of expanding its borders by putting increasing numbers of Jewish settlers in 
occupied Palestine. 
</P>
<P>
 We remind our fellow Americans that Israel's occupation is illegal under 
international law, defies the United Nations, and contradicts repeatedly 
expressed U.S. policy regarding the conflict. For 46 years, we have sometimes 
watched but most of the time put our support behind the aggressor in the 
Israeli-Palestinian conflict. What America needs are a President and a Congress 
who, in the face of potent political pressure, will summon the courage to do 
what is right.

 * The reporting of the events surrounding the mosque massacre exposed a double 
standard in journalism. Absent in the articles are the terms "Jewish terrorism" 
and "Jewish fundamentalism," the probable sources of this and similar 
tragedies. The media, on the other hand, do not hesitate to label any violent 
acts committed by Muslims as terrorist with likely connections to an 
international conspiracy -- claims that are usually unsubstantiated.  
</P>
<P>
 Before the dead have been buried and mourned, the international community is 
reacting by increasing security against presumed fears of retaliation. It is as 
if they cannot tolerate the image of Muslims as victims but want to perpetuate 
the stereotype of Muslims as terrorists. 
</P>
<P>
 We condemn all violent acts committed against innocent civilians in the name 
of religion. We equally abhor the recent attack on Catholic worshipers in 
Lebanon. We call for increased security for the Palestinians who are largely 
defenseless against the armed settlers and an obviously biased Israeli army. 
This could be provided by U.N. soldiers who could at least protect worshipers 
at the mosques, churches and synagogues in the Holy Land. We support the desire 
of the Palestinians for self-determination and concur that progress cannot be 
made without addressing the issue of the settlements in the occupied 
territories.

<P>
 * The murder of dozens of Arab worshipers in Hebron was an atrocity. The Kach 
party's fascist ideology is a perversion and degradation of Jewish values. 
Nevertheless, despite our pain and shame, it is worthwhile to bear in mind 
these points: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin immediately, sincerely and without prompting 
condemned the killings as "a loathsome criminal act of murder." In contrast, 
Yasser Arafat still refuses to discipline or condemn Palestinians who attack 
Israelis, despite his obligation to do so under the Israel-PLO Declaration of 
Principles. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In view of the continuing Palestinian violence against Israelis, 
Palestinian demands that all settlers be disarmed cannot be taken seriously. 
Similarly, calls for expulsion of the settlers violate the principle that the 
final status of the territories remains subject to negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel yearns for peace, and continues to strive for peace. Peace can be 
achieved only if acts of violence and terror from any side are condemned by all 
sides. 
</P>
<P>
 PAUL KUJAWSKY

<P>

</P>
<P>
 * It is Israeli national policy to establish a Palestinian state and to live 
in peace with the Palestinians. But when a Jewish extremist commits an atrocity 
designed to subvert that policy, Paul Conrad responds by defiling the star of 
David (Drawingboard, March 1). Conrad does not respond by defiling the cross 
when a Catholic extremist commits an atrocity in Serbia, or by defiling the 
star and crescent when a Muslim extremist commits an atrocity in Iran, even 
though extremism is national policy in these nations. Compassion for the 
victims, not more extremism, is the appropriate response to the tragedy in 
Hebron. 
</P>
<P>
 Conrad's failure to recognize this is a scar on The Times.

DESIGNING THE 'NEXT L.A.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * In response to The Times' special report "The Next Los Angeles," Feb. 13: 
</P>
<P>
 I want to applaud your special section. The Northridge earthquake has indeed 
challenged our thinking about living in Los Angeles. However, one of the items 
in the "Idea File" is a lot closer to reality than the article indicates. 
Specifically, the satellite communications network described on Page T14 as 
"possible on a limited scale" will actually be available next year when 
American Mobile Satellite Corp. (AMSC) offers a service by which cellular 
subscribers can also make calls over a satellite. AMSC is not a "phone company" 
as indicated in your article, but an independent company licensed by the FCC. 
Hughes has a 27% interest in AMSC and is building its satellite. 
</P>
<P>
 AMSC's service would undoubtedly be invaluable during a disaster. However, its 
principal use is to extend cellular coverage from a city or region to anywhere 
in North America. Contrary to the article, no home dish is required. Users of 
certain models of a cellular phone simply install a satellite booster kit in 
their cars. Only one satellite, not many, is required for nationwide hookup. 
The cost of service will only be somewhat higher than cellular "roaming" is 
today.

 * As a member of the Los Angeles Police Department for 29 years and a deputy 
chief, I read with great anticipation your excellent special report. I 
approached this section with particular intensity because I had just read the 
extensive front-page story which indicated that crime was not only a 
significant concern but the most important concern among Americans and 
Angelenos, even to the point of surpassing the economy. Thus I expected to read 
in "The Next Los Angeles" considerable discussion, research, idea files, etc., 
about new ways of looking at this, the most pressing issue of our time. So I 
was disappointed, not in the quality of the special report -- it was great. The 
tone was upbeat and positive, and we all need large doses of positivity. It was 
simply to my expectation incomplete. 
</P>
<P>
 In finding its way to the next millennium, Los Angeles and all its stake 
holders need to maintain an open and extensive dialogue on all issues important 
to the people, especially the most important ones.

IT'S GETTING HOTTER IN WASHINGTON; WHITEWATER ROILS THE PRESIDENTIAL WATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sometimes the news media are too quick to judge, but if you hear or read the 
troubling term cover-up being applied to the Whitewater controversy more and 
more, it may not be the media's fault. The White House may have only itself to 
blame. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday President Clinton said that high-level briefings that took place 
shouldn't have. The sessions were held among top White House aides -- but did 
not include the President -- and featured an extremely questionable briefing 
last month by Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman. He is not only the No. 2 
Treasury official but also the acting chief of the Resolution Trust Corp. That 
is the government agency investigating the failure of Madison Guaranty Savings 
& Loan Assn. in Arkansas. Altman's briefing gave White House staffers an 
inappropriate advance peek at what the RTC was up to in its probe of the failed 
thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton were real estate partners with the head of 
that S&L in a development known as Whitewater, a 1980s land venture in 
Arkansas. The controversy centers on whether a sweetheart deal was arranged to 
benefit the Clintons and whether Clinton as governor kept at bay the regulators 
concerned about the thrift. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the White House has confessed to the sin of looking bad. It says that 
although it has done nothing wrong, it does itself no good when it does 
anything that appears to be blocking disclosure. That's the right position to 
take. White House officials must recuse themselves -- as Altman belatedly has 
done -- from all matters related to the Whitewater probe. What is at stake is 
not only their careers and their reputations -- serious matters in themselves 
-- but possibly this presidency. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington old pro Lloyd Bentsen understands this. The Treasury secretary has 
asked the independent Office of Government Ethics to probe the contacts between 
Treasury officials and the White House about the S&L. That was the proper thing 
to do. The government's integrity must not be in question. The appearance of 
misconduct can be as corrosive as actual misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
 The phrase Whitewater-gate is already making the Washington rounds these days. 
That's a little too glib. What Whitewater originally was, after all, was a 
financial deal of somewhat lesser magnitude than, say, a good-sized political 
payoff scandal. But if the White House or the President's allies orchestrate in 
any manner a cover-up, or even offer the appearance of a cover-up, then the 
gate suffix will be appended to Whitewater without objection. The White House 
is perilously close to that point. One more major misstep and it may have 
arrived.

A KNOCKING IN THE NIGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With a candor rare in government, federal officials in San Diego have admitted 
they made a terrible blunder when customs and drug agents broke into Donald 
Carlson's home in 1992 and shot him three times -- twice as he lay wounded. But 
we remain puzzled why so little has been done to punish the agents who 
recklessly relied on the dubious informant who fingered Carlson as being part 
of a drug ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is chilling in its detail. Asleep in his suburban Poway home, 
Carlson, 41, an executive with no criminal record, is awakened by pounding on 
his front door. When the intruders do not identify themselves, he fires two 
shots from a pistol. The agents break down his door, throw an explosive device 
at him and shoot him, leaving him permanently injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The agents, from the Customs Service and the Drug Enforcement Administration, 
found no drugs. It turned out that they had been conned by an informer who is 
now under criminal indictment for making false statements to federal agents. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the agencies and the Justice Department's Office of Professional 
Responsibility have completed internal investigations. The results have not 
been released because of the pending criminal case. But, astonishingly, nobody 
has been disciplined. 
</P>
<P>
 The Carlson case is not unique. Only two months after the San Diego shooting, 
federal, state and local officials acting on an informant's tip killed Donald 
P. Scott, a reclusive millionaire, at his ranch in the Santa Monica Mountains. 
The facts are murkier than in the Carlson matter, but there too no drugs were 
found. 
</P>
<P>
 The new U.S. attorney in San Diego, Alan D. Bersin, deserves praise for 
accepting responsibility and agreeing to pay damages to Carlson, the amount to 
be worked out later. He says the DEA and Customs have tightened their 
procedures as a result of the Carlson fiasco. He argues that most drug raids 
are conducted properly and that because of the "convoluted" facts of the 
Carlson case, failure to punish the agents was "not an unjust" result. "The 
more important lesson is to understand how the system failed," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 We disagree on that. No law-abiding American citizen asleep in his home should 
be subjected to such abuse, more appropriate to a police state. Somebody should 
pay a penalty, possibly criminal, for ruining Donald Carlson's life.

ABSURDITY WATCH; WASTE A MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The referendum on recalling state Sen. David A. Roberti is on the April ballot 
in large part because of his eminently sensible support for tighter gun control 
laws. That's why the gun lobby paid big bucks to gather signatures in Roberti's 
district to force a special recall election -- despite the fact that the Van 
Nuys Democrat is set to leave the Senate in December under term limits.Clearly, 
the recall is no more than a political vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
 It is illuminating to assess this taxpayer-financed venture in monetary terms. 
As Los Angeles County officials project a shortfall of $1 billion in the next 
fiscal year, a question arises: What else could be done with the $800,000 to $1 
million it will cost to conduct the recall election? 
</P>
<P>
 -- The money could buy quite a few books for the county library system. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could ease cuts in the district attorney's office or the Sheriff's 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could restore more than a third of the cutback in county monies needed 
to maintain and patrol county parks to keep them safe for visitors, such as 
your children. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could fund six months of the valuable work done by crossing guards at 
134 schools throughout the county. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could pay the salaries of 27 to 33 schoolteachers for a year. 
</P>
<P>
 -- It could restore all of the eliminated hours at the county Department of 
Animal Care and Control. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's enemies seem to be thumbing their noses at the taxpayer, flaunting 
an attitude of "what's a million here or there?" The only thing as bad as the 
motive behind this recall is the price tag.

THE POWER OF AN AMERICAN FILM; 'SCHINDLER'S LIST' SERVES AS BOTH ART AND A 
TEACHING TOOL FOR GERMANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There could be no more problematic audience for Steven Spielberg's powerful 
Holocaust movie, "Schindler's List," than the Germans. The film has now opened 
in Germany, to mostly solemn and respectful reviews -- and tight security. A 
special invited audience on Tuesday night in Frankfurt included President 
Richard von Weizsaecker and many other dignitaries. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 
sometimes accused of not taking a hard line against neo-Nazis, did not attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Postwar German leaders have confronted their country's Nazi past and its guilt 
in the attempted extermination of Europe's Jews with considerable honesty and 
courage. But the topic remains a difficult one for modern Germany. Certainly 
its youths should not be held accountable for the sins of their parents and 
grandparents -- but they are ignorant in many ways of the evils of Nazism, and 
a neo-Nazi movement has gained thousands of violent followers among young 
people born long after the death camps were shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 It's striking that it has fallen to foreigners like Spielberg, an American 
Jew, to use the popular media to help teach the German public about the 
nation's painful history. The German government had refused to back proposals 
to film the story of Oskar Schindler -- a Nazi credited with saving the lives 
of 1,100 Jews working at his wartime ceramics factory in Poland -- because, it 
said, financial success for such a motion picture was unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps an outsider had to do this project; a German-made film on the noble 
Schindler, a "good" Nazi, might have been dismissed as self-serving or 
self-justifying. And it is improbable that "Schindler's List" will convert many 
neo-fascists. 
</P>
<P>
 But no one who has seen this moving film can mistake its message about the 
evils of fascism and the capacity of humans to rise above such barbarism. Let 
us hope it gains a wide audience in Germany and that it helps encourage the 
great majority of Germans who want to put their past to rest and to root out 
the remnants of the evil that once sprouted in their soil.

THERE'S MONEY TO BE MADE FROM VIRTUE; CLEAN AIR: THE FEDERAL PLAN ISN'T A 
BURDEN FOR INDUSTRY; IT'S AN EXCITING, POTENTIALLY LUCRATIVE TECHNOLOGICAL 
CHALLENGE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TOM SOTO and CLIFF GLADSTEIN, Tom Soto is president of the Coalition for 
Clean Air. Cliff Gladstein is a member of the Board of the Coalition for Clean 
Air. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1972, when Johnny Nash released his classic, "I Can See Clearly Now," L.A. 
disc jockeys played it sardonically. Our air basin was the filthiest in the 
country, and smog and Los Angeles were synonymous. 
</P>
<P>
 Our air basin is still the nation's dirtiest, exceeding federal air quality 
standards 180 days a year on average, but it's a good deal cleaner than it used 
to be. Keeping us on this improving course is the purpose of the Environmental 
Protection Agency's federal implementation plan for air quality in Southern 
California. The plan offers a smorgasbord of regulatory measures to further 
reduce pollution from both industrial and residential sources, supplementing 
state and local measures. 
</P>
<P>
 The goal, of course, is improved health and air quality. Clean air will 
actually cut the death rate. And clean air means Los Angeles schoolchildren 
will no longer suffer a 20% reduction in lung capacity compared with children 
raised elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 There are some who argue that the new federal standards will cost too much and 
will hurt rather than help business. They argue that Los Angeles will lose 
cargoes to other ports, that railroads will require two sets of locomotives -- 
one for California only -- that airline operations may be restricted; in short, 
that we can't afford it. To the contrary, we can't afford the $9 billion a year 
in lost productivity that smog brings with it, or the $1 billion lost when 
commuters sit idle in traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 We also know that a clean-air plan has to offer more than blue skies to 
attract the support of the business community. California's environmental 
technology industry produced revenues of $18.2 billion in 1992 and employed 
nearly 150,000 people. It is the fastest-growing sector of the California 
economy. By the turn of the century the international environmental 
technologies market will be $300 billion a year, and California's clean-air 
entrepreneurs will be well-placed to capture much of that burgeoning world 
market. 
</P>
<P>
 Managed properly, the federal mandates could lead to a new wave of public 
works projects that would dramatically alter California's transportation 
infrastructure. Federal funds earmarked for pollution cleanup could be used to 
support non-polluting mass-transportation systems such as electric rail and 
trolley buses and for the development of an electric-vehicle industry using 
advanced transportation technologies created in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 The advanced transportation industry alone could yield as many as 24,000 jobs 
by 2003 and revive California as a high-tech manufacturing center, according to 
a study by the UCLA Lewis Center for Regional Policy Studies. By 2010, Project 
California predicts, an electric-vehicle industry could create 70,000 local 
jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Assn. of Governments also projects growth in the 
electric-vehicle industry, creating high-skilled, high-wage jobs. It's a an 
industry where equal opportunity has real meaning. A Rockefeller has yet to 
emerge in the field; it is open to all daring entrepreneurs. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to aiding creation of a new industry, the federal mandates can 
help justify continued federal support for the Alameda Corridor, the nonstop 
railroad route that will connect Los Angeles' seaports with Downtown, allowing 
increased, cost-effective movement of goods in an environmentally sound 
fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 We have an opportunity to make good on the promise of sustainable economic 
development. It is a chance to end the state's dependence on "imported" cars, 
whether from other countries or other states and break free of the oil industry 
monopoly on transportation fuels. Diversification will lead to competition, 
which will ultimately lead to higher efficiencies and lower costs. 
</P>
<P>
 None of this is to say that there will be no controversies, or even sacrifices 
in return for clean air. But this is our chance to form a new paradigm, in 
which clean air has a consensus value so high that businesses will voluntarily 
change to meet community needs. "I Can See Clearly Now" wouldn't have to be a 
joke.

A MAD RUSSIAN'S SERIOUS PLAN FOR WAR; ZHIRINOVSKY: IT'S AN OPEN BOOK, HIS 
VISION OF CONQUERING THE MUSLIM WORLD. FOR THE WEST, IT'S 1930, WEIMAR TIME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALEXANDER YANOV, Alexander Yanov is the author of The Russian Challenge and 
the Year 2000. He is working on a book about Zhirinovsky. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For anyone still in doubt that anti-democratic forces now dominate the Russian 
Parliament, the 253-67 vote granting amnesty to those who tried to overthrow 
Boris Yeltsin should be instructive. While U.S. pundits have been worrying 
about the future of market reform in Russia, the real issue facing Russians is 
who is most likely to inherit Yeltsin's mantle. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer, provided by an authoritative survey conducted in December, is 
Vladimir Zhirinovsky. When respondents were asked for whom they would vote if 
Yeltsin were not on the list of candidates, Zhirinovsky was an undisputed 
favorite, leaving far behind both the leading reformer, Yegor Gaidar, and the 
leading proponent of slow-paced reform, Prime Minister Viktor S. Chernomyrdin. 
</P>
<P>
 To date the American media have treated Zhirinovsky on the same anecdotal 
level as Hitler was viewed in the 1920s -- that is, as an enfant terrible of 
politics, a quarrelsome clown and a brawler rather than as a man who has a 
pretty good shot at determining one day the geopolitical course of a nuclear 
superpower. Once again, as 70 years ago, we prefer to think that the current 
Russian government's financial mismanagement, as in Weimar Germany, can only 
give the respectable reformers a chance to return to the helm -- and then we 
will support them more effectively than we did before. 
</P>
<P>
 But given the total collapse of Russia's industry, already equivalent to the 
devastation of the Great Depression (and which the reformers did not even start 
to address), it seems too late for such rosy scenarios. Instead, it is much 
more likely that any further mismanagement will only pave the way for 
Zhirinovsky. 
</P>
<P>
 If Zhirinovsky becomes president of Russia, it would mean another world war -- 
I personally do not doubt this. His Hitlerian geopolitical plan, worked out by 
the strategists of Moscow's general staff, is set forth in his book, "The Last 
March to the South." 
</P>
<P>
 First of all, Zhirinovsky does not believe that the current Russian crisis can 
be resolved in the domestic arena. Like Hitler, he sees the "salvation of the 
nation" in war and conquest. But not in a nuclear war, and not in one with 
either the West or with China. His quarrel is with the Muslim world (the only 
exception being his current friend, ally and financier, Saddam Hussein). Its 
riches, and especially its oil, he promises, would save Russia. He recognizes 
that "some people" in Tehran, Ankara or Riyadh may object to their countries 
becoming Russian provinces, "but the whole world should think that if Russia 
needs it -- it is for the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he notes, "the majority of mankind is interested in dissecting the 
Muslim world. The Muslim peril has to be eliminated." This would supposedly be 
Russia's greatest service to modern civilization. Moreover, the Russian army's 
"last march to the south would lead it to the shores of the Indian Ocean and to 
the Mediterranean, and mean liberation for 20 million Kurds, hundreds of 
thousands of Baluchis (and) Pushtuns." 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, this would be "the last redivision of the world and thus has to be 
done as a form of shock therapy -- suddenly, swiftly, effectively." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our army," Zhirinovsky continues, "is capable of this, all the more so since 
this is the only way of survival for the nation. And it will be the basis for 
the rejuvenation of the Russian army. The new military can be reborn only in 
the course of a military operation. An army degenerates in the barracks. It 
needs a goal, a great task. It needs to exercise its muscle. This would be 
purification for all of us. And the ringing of the Russian Orthodox bells on 
the shores of the Indian Ocean and the Mediterranean would be the sound of 
peace for the people of the region." 
</P>
<P>
 Such, in the briefest of outlines, is Zhirinovsky's "Mein Kampf." The first 
impression is certainly the same that one gets from reading Hitler's opus: The 
man is certifiably insane. It is as easy to discard Zhirinovsky's book in the 
1990s as it was to dismiss Hitler's in the 1920s. For one thing, what does he 
think the rest of the world would do while his armies marched to the oil fields 
of the Middle East in order to monopolize this vital strategic resource? 
</P>
<P>
 But wait. Zhirinovsky has a quite impressive answer to this. According to him, 
the rest of the world would do precisely what it did when Hitler's armies 
marched around Europe -- nothing. This is what Russia's "nuclear shield" is all 
about: to ensure a new Munich on the part of the West. And, indeed, would any 
Western government risk annihilation for the sake of Turkey, let alone Iran? 
</P>
<P>
 All other Russian leaders, beginning with Mikhail Gorbachev, have politely 
asked the world for aid. The results are evident: Russia is perishing. 
Zhirinovsky threatens to take what he needs by force. And if it means a world 
war, so be it.  
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the only, possibly fateful, blunder he has made is to let the world 
know too early what he has in store for it. "I see Russian soldiers preparing 
for their last march to the south. I see Russian commanders tracing on their 
maps the routes to the final destination. I see airborne planes in our southern 
regions. I see submarines coming to the surface at the shores of the Indian 
Ocean. I see our marines landing on these shores where the soldiers of the 
Russian army are already marching, and armored vehicles moving along with 
tremendous masses of tanks." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, in getting to the oil-rich Middle East, Russia's armies would have 
to march through the former Soviet Union's southern, largely Muslim, 
territories, and this is also something Zhirinovsky has very much in mind -- 
their reconquest, accompanied, no doubt, by a little ethnic cleansing. But 
here, too, in light of Europe and the United States' slow response to Bosnia, 
Zhirinovsky may be placing a shrewd bet.  
</P>
<P>
 There are still months, perhaps years, before this nightmarish vision becomes 
reality. Russia is only at about 1930 on the Weimar scale. The suicidal plan 
can still be derailed. But will the world read Zhirinovsky's "Mein Kampf" any 
more attentively than it did Hitler's? It may rather lull itself with a 
comfortable dream that reformers are somehow coming back to the helm in Moscow, 
without doing anything to make that happen.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; DOGGONE FED UP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Man's best friend is not always that for the mail carrier. Biting dogs long 
have been an occupational hazard for the men and women who walk the postal 
routes.If the elements cannot deter carriers from completing their appointed 
rounds, it is possible that a rendezvous with Rover will. 
</P>
<P>
 Pepper spray, described colorfully by one postal official as "glorified salad 
dressing," doesn't seem up to the job of deterrence. The dog problem persists. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend, mail carriers in Garden Grove decided that they had had enough. 
They marched in force, delivering a message on a Sunday morning. About 100 
protesters told their community: "Keep your dogs locked up, they bite." 
</P>
<P>
 The unusual protest was designed to increase public awareness of dog attacks 
on mail carriers. According to Postmaster Alyce Alford, six Garden Grove mail 
carriers have been bitten in the last six months. And these are not necessarily 
small inconveniences; one carrier had to be reassigned to a desk job in 1989 
after an attack left him having to use a cane. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not just Garden Grove's concern. In fiscal 1993, 2,733 carriers 
reportedly were injured by dogs nationwide. On the day Garden Grove carriers 
marched, some colleagues from nearby Huntington Beach joined in. 
</P>
<P>
 This demonstration should serve as a reminder that a wonderful pet that 
"wouldn't harm a fly" may respond differently to the approach of a mail 
carrier. The carriers' request seems reasonable enough: Keep dogs inside or 
otherwise secured during mail delivery hours.

TROJANS TURN IT AROUND ON DOWN-TURNED BRUINS; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: USC AVENGES 
29-POINT LOSS, 85-79. UCLA IS ONLY A .500 TEAM IN ITS LAST 10 GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 USC took out its season of frustration Thursday night by defeating archrival 
and No. 15 UCLA, 85-79, at the Sports Arena. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans played more like the team in the hunt for the Pacific 10 
Conference title than UCLA, as they received outstanding efforts from Brandon 
Martin, who finished with 19 points, and Mark Boyd, who had 17, to hand the 
Bruins their third loss in their last four games and their fifth in 10 games. 
</P>
<P>
 USC outshot, outrebounded and outhustled UCLA in avenging an earlier 29-point 
loss to the Bruins at Pauley Pavilion. USC (14-11, 7-9) now moves into position 
to gain an National Invitation Tournament berth after losing eight of nine 
games only a month ago. 
</P>
<P>
 After starting the season 14-0, UCLA looked like a troubled team against the 
Trojans, who had four players score in double figures. Instead of playing with 
momentum heading toward the NCAA tournament, the Bruins' frustration showed as 
Ed O'Bannon was ejected from the game for throwing a punch at USC's Tremayne 
Anchrum, who also was ejected, in the final two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 For Boyd, the victory made him the first four-year USC starter to finish his 
career with a winning record against UCLA. He finished with a 6-4 record 
against the Bruins. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA (19-5, 12-4), No. 1 in the country a few weeks ago, is now No. 2 in the 
Pac-10 to Arizona. 
</P>
<P>
 With backup seniors John Masdea and Damaine Powell in the starting lineup in 
their final college home game for USC, the first three minutes of the game were 
filled with turnovers and wild fouls. The Trojans gained the most from the 
sloppy play when UCLA point guard Tyus Edney picked up his third foul on a 
charge with 14:11 remaining in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of coming out of the game, Edney led a 6-0 UCLA run, with backup 
Cameron Dollar waiting to check into the game, as the Bruins took a 12-7 lead 
at the 12:45 mark. The Trojans then tied the score on five consecutive points 
by Martin, who scored 11 in the first half, before UCLA outscored USC, 8-1, to 
take a 20-12 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 That's when the Trojans went to work. With Tremayne Anchrum making three 
first-half three-pointers and Burt Harris adding five points, USC outscored the 
Bruins, 26-11, over the final eight minutes of the half. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA's halfcourt offense struggled with Edney on the bench, as Charles 
O'Bannon and Kevin Dempsey took turns missing three-pointers and the Trojans 
dominating on the backboards. UCLA shot only 32.1% from the field as the 
Trojans outrebounded UCLA, 22-19, in taking a 39-31 halftime lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Before completing its Pac-10 schedule, UCLA will play Louisville Sunday in a 
nonconference game at Pauley Pavilion. The Bruins, who defeated Louisville in 
their last meeting in the second round of the NCAA tournament in 1992, have 
defeated the Cardinals in 11 of their 16 games. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, the Bruins will pick up their drive to win their second Pac-10 
title in six seasons under Harrick with two road games next week at Oregon 
State and Oregon. UCLA swept the Oregon schools in January by an average of 25 
points at Pauley Pavilion. 
</P>
<P>
 With its NCAA tournament hopes long gone, USC can only hope for a second 
consecutive berth in the National Invitation Tournament. Last year, the Trojans 
advanced to the quarterfinals before losing at Minnesota, the eventual 
champion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans will also close with road games next week at Oregon and Oregon 
State, and they will need a sweep in order to keep their postseason quest 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in a desperate position," Raveling said. "Just like teams are chasing 
NCAA bids now, we're chasing an NIT bid. Just as teams are trying to finish the 
season right, we're trying to finish right.  
</P>
<P>
 "(Getting an NIT berth) is not the reward we started the season seeking, but 
it's the best we have awaiting us now. You don't always get to the party riding 
in a limousine. Sometimes you have to take a taxi, and that means the NIT." A 
Falling Out 
</P>
<P>
 With its loss to USC, UCLA dropped out of first place in the Pacific 10 
standings for the first time this season. A look at the conference standings:

BOSTON'S OFFENSE BEWILDERS KINGS; PRO HOCKEY: GRETZKY AND COMPANY GET NO 
RESPITE IN A 6-4 LOSS TO THE BRUINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Have the Kings forgotten how to ice the puck? 
</P>
<P>
 It might not have been the only reason they lost, 6-4, to the Boston Bruins on 
Thursday night, but their failure to get even a few seconds respite from the 
Bruins' relentless attack proved costly midway through the third period. 
</P>
<P>
 Boston was holding a 5-4 lead and was inspired after killing off defenseman 
Ray Bourque's tripping penalty. The Bruins started swarming and the Kings 
panicked, skating around with no clear plan of action. 
</P>
<P>
 In a span of 1:30, the Bruins had five shots on goal. The sellout crowd of 
14,448 got louder and the small confines of Boston Garden seemed to grow even 
smaller. Warren Rychel muffed a clearing attempt. Alexei Zhitnik coughed up the 
puck to Bruin forward Brent Hughes. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, forward Jozef Stumpel put the Kings out of their 90-seconds of 
misery, firing a shot from the left circle off defenseman Tim Watters' right 
skate that squirted between goaltender Robb Stauber's legs at 9:35 of the 
third. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruins 6, Kings 4. And that was the end of it. The only suspense left was 
whether Wayne Gretzky would inch closer to Gordie Howe's all-time goal record 
of 801. But Gretzky, who had one assist, remained three away from tying the 
record and had only one shot on goal, that in the first period. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bruins are headed in the opposite direction from the Kings, having lost 
only one of their last 11 games in an 8-1-2 stretch. The Kings, on the other 
hand, have won only once in their last 11 games and are five points behind San 
Jose, which defeated the Oilers, 4-2, Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Rychel accepted responsibility for the bad clearance that led to Stumpel's 
goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "I had the last chance to clear it," he said. "I was trying to get it out and 
it spun off (my stick). Then it goes off two legs and goes in. It was 
compounded by my mistakes and their bounces. I'll take the rap." 
</P>
<P>
 Watters talked about the Kings' inability to ice the puck. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make the perfect play all the time to get it out," he said. "It's 
not possible. You can't always do that. Everything happens so fast in these 
small buildings. You've got to use the boards and get the puck out of your 
zone." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings refuse to use the attention surrounding Gretzky's pursuit of Howe's 
goal record as an excuse. "A lot of things make me nervous -- this isn't one of 
them," King Coach Barry Melrose said. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Rychel: "This should be an exciting thing. Guys should pick up their 
play. We shouldn't be nervous and this shouldn't be a distraction." 
</P>
<P>
 Gretzky, of course, is used to disruptions of every sort. In his career, he 
has scored 21 times against the Bruins and said that relatively small number of 
goals, at least for him, has a lot to do with a bigger on-ice distraction -- -- 
Bourque. 
</P>
<P>
 "Probably the biggest reason is I've played a lot against 77," Gretzky said. 
"He's a pretty good hockey player. I've had a good playoff against them, but I 
haven't played well against the Bruins in the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's out there almost every shift I'm out there. Hopefully, Sunday I'll 
rebound." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings (22-34-9) are in Chicago on Sunday and return to Los Angeles for 
games against the Blackhawks on Wednesday and Buffalo on March 12. Gretzky, 
however, does not want this to turn into a prolonged vigil. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want it to be drawn out," he said. "I don't want this thing to drag 
on and put people out of their schedules following me. I want to score as badly 
as they want me to. So we can all go home." King Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Kings and Lakers are taking part in a "Tickets for Guns" program March 
5-12 that allows individuals to turn unloaded weapons in to the Inglewood 
Police Department in exchange for two tickets to selected Kings or Lakers 
games. The gun must be unloaded, must be locked in the trunk of a vehicle and 
must be removed only by a police officer.

CAHILL PULLS RANK ON ROSSET THIS TIME; TENNIS: AUSTRALIAN FOLLOWS UPSET OF 
IVANISEVIC WITH ANOTHER SURPRISING VICTORY TO REACH QUARTERFINALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 On Wednesday, he showed Goran Ivanisevic. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, he showed Marc Rosset. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not the 1,013th player in the world," Darren Cahill said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is according to the ATP Tour computer rankings, but that happens when 
you're sidelined for nearly three years because of a knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Newsweek Champions Cup at Hyatt Grand Champions, Cahill is a 
quarterfinalist after eliminating the 11th-seeded Rosset, 6-4, 5-7, 7-6 (7-5), 
only 24 hours after upsetting the fifth-seeded Ivanisevic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ivanisevic and Rosset, who are doubles partners, reacted similarly to being 
ousted, each grabbing his gear and storming off the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosset punctuated his exit by smashing his racket. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a close match, you know," Cahill said. "I would have been upset if I had 
lost -- maybe not to that extent -- but 7-6 in the third, it's just a point 
here or there. What can I say? I'm just happy to win." 
</P>
<P>
 The 28-year-old Aussie is happy just to be playing. 
</P>
<P>
 Cahill underwent the first of four operations on his left knee in April 1991 
and spent most of the next 2 1/2 years rehabilitating the knee and running the 
sports bars he co-owns in his native Adelaide with a lawyer, a cricket player 
and an Australian Rules football player. 
</P>
<P>
 Before he started practicing again about three months ago, he said, he hadn't 
hit a ball in more than 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 And although he won a doubles title with countryman Sandon Stolle at Sydney in 
early January, he hadn't won a singles match in four tour events before this 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, he lost in the first round of a qualifier. 
</P>
<P>
 But because his ranking was protected at No. 73 for purposes of entering six 
tournaments in the first six months after his return, Cahill was part of the 
56-man main draw in the Newsweek Champions Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 He won in the first round when Olivier Delaitre retired because of a back 
injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Now among the final eight, he'll play Stefan Edberg today. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprised? 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess a little," Cahill said. "My form's been good coming into the 
tournament, but to beat two guys of the caliber (of Ivanisevic and Rosset) . . 
. I'm a little surprised. But very happy about it." 
</P>
<P>
 A U.S. Open semifinalist in 1988, Cahill earned a career-high ranking of No. 
22 in 1989 and has won two tour singles titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Retirement from the tour, he said, was not a consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always working every day toward getting back on the tennis court," he 
said. "When I (was injured), I was only 25 years old. And now I'm only 28. I 
still think there's a good two or three or four years left in me. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were times when I got depressed, especially come Wimbledon, come the 
Australian Open -- all the Grand Slam times. You're sitting home watching on 
telly instead of getting out there playing. But, really, the first six or eight 
months were the most frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "After that, I looked at it as a challenge to get back on the court. It didn't 
really enter my mind about giving it away." Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Top-ranked Pete Sampras fired 17 aces in defeating MaliVai Washington, 7-5, 
6-2, to move into the quarterfinals. Sampras has won 26 matches in a row 
against U.S. players and is 7-0 against Washington. . . . Also advancing to the 
quarterfinals were third-seeded Stefan Edberg, 6-2, 6-3, over Fabrice Santoro; 
No. 8 Thomas Muster, 6-4, 6-4, over Jonathan Stark; No. 10 Petr Korda, 6-4, 
3-6, 6-2, over No. 7 Todd Martin; No. 12 Alexander Volkov, 6-4, 1-6, 6-3, over 
No. 6 Michael Chang; No. 16 Carlos Costa, 4-6, 6-4, 7-5, over Patrick Rafter, 
and unseeded Aaron Krickstein, 2-6, 6-4, 6-4 over Patrick McEnroe. . . . The 
temperature on the stadium court was 106 degrees at 11 a.m., 120 degrees five 
hours later, but none of the players complained. . . . For the record: Goran 
Ivanisevic, winless in his last four appearances in this tournament, won two 
matches at Grand Champions in 1990.

MORNING BRIEFING: AND HE THOUGHT HIS DAYS AS SECOND-STRINGER WERE OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 It was a big day for kindergartners at Ponderosa Elementary School in Post 
Falls, Ida., when quarterback Mark Rypien of the Washington Redskins came to 
visit. 
</P>
<P>
 Rypien entered the classroom with police officer Pete Marion, the school's 
Drug Awareness, Resistance and Education (DARE) officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Teacher Mary Rohlman asked, "Children, do you know who this is?" 
</P>
<P>
 The class shouted back in unison, "It's Officer Pete!" 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Who won the first GTE Classic on the senior golf tour and where 
was it played? 
</P>
<P>
 It's that time: You know baseball is in full swing, Phil Jackman of the 
Baltimore Sun notes, when "players' association honcho Don Fehr is beginning a 
tour of the camps to discuss antitrust hearings, revenue sharing, the new TV 
contract, the possibility of a late-season strike and all the other things that 
make this game great." 
</P>
<P>
 Name alike: The Mighty Ducks of the NHL are firmly established in Anaheim, but 
Joseph J. Lesko, a heating and plumbing contractor in Newport Beach, is 
sometimes confused with them. 
</P>
<P>
 Lesko's firm is called the Mighty Ducts. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference: Future Hall of Fame baseball star George Brett, in analyzing 
the chances of Michael Jordan playing major league baseball, had this to say: 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a lot harder than he thinks it's going to be. If you get 
three hits out of every 10 times up, you fail seven times. If you hit .300 you 
are a superstar. If you are a basketball player and you shoot 30% you don't 
have a job." 
</P>
<P>
 Cash-and-carry: Dave O'Brien, director of sports, athletics and recreation at 
Long Beach State, has issued an ultimatum to his coaches and staff: 
</P>
<P>
 "Effective immediately, you are not to order pizzas from Ave. No. 3 Pizza 
unless you have the cash on hand to pay," he wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 It seems that somehow they ran up a $1,200 tab of unpaid pizza bills. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice as much: Most golfers have trouble hitting one ball straight with an 
iron, but now Head Sports has come up with a new club, the Big Head Iron, that 
can allegedly hit two balls at once. 
</P>
<P>
 Why anyone would want to hit two balls at once is puzzling, but Bob Puccini, 
president of Head, introduced the new club at the PGA Show. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the golf course, the two balls fly side by side and land together," the 
company press notice stated. 
</P>
<P>
 What it didn't state was whether the two shots landed inbounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Long way off: If you want tickets to the 1995 Final Four in Seattle, it's time 
to make a move. Applications must be submitted by April 22, 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The tickets -- $70, $50 or $35 depending on location -- are for the NCAA 
semifinal and final basketball games April 1 and April 3, 1995, at the 
Kingdome. There will be a random computerized drawing, and applicants will be 
notified of the results about June 30.

Valley.

TV-RADIO / LARRY STEWART: GOLDEN, KRIKORIAN AGAIN SEE KMPC'S REVOLVING DOOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LARRY STEWART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the wacky world of sports-talk radio, you just never know what will happen 
next. 
</P>
<P>
 Word came late Thursday that KMPC has fired midday hosts Brian Golden and Doug 
Krikorian. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the second sacking for both. They were also fired last June in an 
apparent money-saving move by the station, but both ended up back on the air. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, they apparently were let go for something as trivial as not showing 
up to test drive a sponsor's car at Willow Springs Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden, a loyal trooper if there ever was one, was ill, and Krikorian was busy 
rehearsing for a bit part in a movie about Ty Cobb. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they had told me it was mandatory for me to be in Willow Springs, I would 
have gone," Krikorian said. "But I got approval to miss it. This is the 
damnedest thing that's ever happened to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Is this firing permanent? No telling. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden's and Krikorian's ratings have been increasing, and program director 
Scott O'Neil likes their work. 
</P>
<P>
 Calls to General Manager Bill Ward and O'Neil were not returned. 
</P>

<P>
 Down at XTRA, the new morning show so far is a bust. 
</P>
<P>
 Rick Schwartz, a relative newcomer to the talk-show business, had a great 
thing going at nights with Steve Mason. They called the gig, "Too Much Show," 
and it really was too much. 
</P>
<P>
 The program often veered away from sports, but rarely from being fun and 
entertaining. 
</P>
<P>
 They called their regular callers a dysfunctional family, and that's what they 
were. Ed from Anaheim, who would play his trumpet upon request, was a regular. 
So was Drew from San Diego, until the law caught up with him and jailed him for 
an alleged series of bank robberies. 
</P>
<P>
 The show was fun -- and always upbeat. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mason left the station in January, and now Schwartz has moved to mornings, 
hooking up with a couple of former FM disc jockeys, Mike Berger and Jeff 
Prescott. 
</P>
<P>
 With the popular "Loose Cannons" duo of Steve Hartman and Chet Forte having 
their time cut to two hours, it's now Berger, Prescott and Schwartz in the 
mornings on XTRA. 
</P>
<P>
 Sounds like a law firm. Might as well be. In a word, their show is 
B-O-R-I-N-G. 
</P>
<P>
 They still identify the station as "XTRA sports 690." But there are no sports 
on this show. On Tuesday, the main topic was smoking. On Thursday, it was junk 
mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz is positioned off by himself in XTRA's Woodland Hills studios. The 
other two are together in San Diego. This three-man show could be called "Too 
Many, Too Little." 
</P>
<P>
 "Too Much Show" was everything this show isn't. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz, always the optimist, isn't complaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a big promotion for a guy who's been in radio for only a year and a 
half," he said. "I'm now the station's morning guy in L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given time, I'm very confident that with the talent of Mike and Jeff, the 
three of us will put together a great show." 
</P>
<P>
 They've got a ways to go. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Schwartz, the son of a doctor, grew up in comfortable surroundings in Beverly 
Hills. He attended UC Santa Barbara for two years before transferring to UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz, who turned 31 Wednesday, said he has always been a positive thinker, 
but a visit to war-torn Yugoslavia in November of 1991 gave him a new outlook 
on life. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you stand over dead children and watch mothers looking for their sons in 
make-shift morgues, when you get pulled off a mine and you get shot at, you 
realize life is very short and very precious and you have to make the most of 
every day. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you see what I saw, you realize the everyday problems we have are not 
all that important." 
</P>
<P>
 When he returned home in January 1992, he decided to pursue his dream of 
becoming a sportscaster. He kept beating on XTRA's door until he got a weekend 
show, and the career took off from there. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, not long after returning from Yugoslavia, Schwartz was having dinner 
with friends at DC-3, a Santa Monica restaurant, when he noticed what he said 
was "the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen." 
</P>
<P>
 He went right up to her. "After what I had just been through in Yugoslavia, 
there was no way I was going to be scared to talk to a beautiful girl," 
Schwartz said. "I was in the fame of mind that you had to go after what you 
wanted." 
</P>
<P>
 The girl was Michelle Turley, a nationally known model. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz asked her to lunch, and she accepted. After the lunch date, they 
spent every day together for the next two weeks, then went to Las Vegas to be 
married.

 Betsy King's 71 was the only sub-par score of the day, and her 36-hole total 
of one-under-par 143 was good for a four-stroke lead Thursday midway through 
the $700,000 LPGA Tournament of Champions at Grand Cypress Resort in Orlando, 
Fla.

 Nancy Lopez, one of three golfers at 147, shot a 72 and was the only other

with the hearing.

 Harding's attorneys contend the USFSA has the authority to hold the hearing 
only after the criminal investigation of Harding is complete.

 In a case that affects numerous professional athletes, the state Supreme Court 
left intact a ruling requiring former Raider quarterback Marc Wilson to pay 
state taxes based on the time he spent in California during the football 
season. The case, a dispute over $119,000 in taxes, penalties and interest from 
1984 through 1986, involved the question of whether Wilson's contract required 
him to be on the job all year or only during the NFL season. Football

NHL ROUNDUP; BELFOUR KEEPS OPPOSITION AT BAY AS BLACKHAWKS WIN

<TEXT>
<P>
 Chicago goaltender Ed Belfour had to face only 17 shots Thursday, most from 
long range. 
</P>
<P>
 Who would want to get close? 
</P>
<P>
 Belfour was called for elbowing Calgary's Sandy McCarthy in the first period 
of the Blackhawks' 4-2 victory at Chicago, but it was a miscarriage of justice. 
Actually, Belfour hit McCarthy in the head with his stick. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the second period Belfour tripped Paul Kruse as he skated past the 
Chicago goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's my turf," Belfour said. "If they keep getting away with (muscling in 
on his turf), they're going to take advantage of it. The referees rarely see 
what happens out there." 
</P>
<P>
 At night's end, Belfour had his 28th victory of the season, and Chicago had 
only its fourth in its last 14 games at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Vancouver 4, St. Louis 0 -- Kirk McLean shut out the Blues for the second time 
and Pavel Bure scored two goals at St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 The Blues are 5-6-0 in their last 11 games. The Canucks are 3-1-1 in their 
last five games and 5-5-1 in their last 11. 
</P>
<P>
 McLean, who blanked the Blues on Nov. 16, stopped 33 shots to earn his third 
shutout of the year and the 16th of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks, who rank first in the league in power-play goals on the road, 
scored all their goals while St. Louis was short-handed. 
</P>
<P>
 New Jersey 5, Tampa Bay 4 -- John MacLean scored his team-leading 30th goal at 
3:04 of overtime, leading the Devils at St. Petersburg, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLean's goal, assisted by Bobby Holik, capped a comeback from a 3-1 deficit. 
</P>
<P>
 San Jose 4, Edmonton 2 -- Defenseman Sandis Ozolinish had a goal and an assist 
for the Sharks at San Jose, where they went three points ahead of the Mighty 
Ducks and five ahead of the Kings for the final playoff spot in the Western 
Conference.

NBA ROUNDUP; HAWKS, MANNING ON WINNING STREAK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Danny Manning said he wanted to play for a winner when he left the Clippers, 
and he's getting his wish with Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 So what if the Hawks were winners before he came to them? Thus far, he is a 
perfect fit in their lineup. And the Hawks are perfect with him. 
</P>
<P>
 Manning scored half of his 22 points in the fourth quarter Thursday night to 
lead Atlanta to its fifth victory in a row, 109-98, over Washington. Playing in 
his third game since being obtained from the Clippers, Manning also had 13 
rebounds and seven assists. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he came here, he said wanted to be a part of the team -- not the main 
person," Coach Lenny Wilkens said. "You don't come in and take over a winning 
team; you come in and fit in." 
</P>
<P>
 And sometimes take charge. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hawks had a one-point lead when Duane Ferrell scored on a dunk off a pass 
from Manning to spark an 8-0 run that made it 102-93 with 3:04 left. Manning 
had four points in the surge to help send the Bullets to their 14th loss in 
their last 17 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State 120, Phoenix 107 -- Chris Mullin scored 25 points and Avery 
Johnson made his last seven shots to finish with a season-high 23 points for 
the Warriors in a victory at Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State won its second consecutive game over Phoenix after enduring a 
six-game losing streak to the Suns over two seasons. Charles Barkley led all 
scorers with 26 points and had 11 rebounds for the Suns. 
</P>
<P>
 New York 97, New Jersey 86 -- Patrick Ewing had 28 points and 16 rebounds, and 
the Knicks opened the fourth quarter with a 15-0 run at New York to beat the 
Nets for the first time in four tries this season. 
</P>
<P>
 A midcourt three-pointer by Chris Morris at the third-quarter buzzer gave the 
Nets their only lead of the second half, 72-71, but they missed their first 11 
shots of the fourth quarter and the Knicks took an 86-72 lead with 5:59 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Cleveland 95, Philadelphia 87 -- John Williams had 20 points and 12 rebounds 
and Mark Price made two key defensive plays in the closing minute at Richfield, 
Ohio, as the Cavaliers won their ninth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Philadelphia lost its 11th in a row, its longest losing streak since it 
dropped 13 consecutive games during its 9-73 season in 1972-73. 
</P>
<P>
 Orlando 107, Dallas 94 -- Shaquille O'Neal had 43 points and 16 rebounds at 
Dallas, and the Magic won for the eighth time in nine games. 
</P>
<P>
 It was O'Neal's fifth 40-point game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Jackson scored 21 points for the Mavericks.

UC IRVINE PAYS PRICE FOR LETDOWN 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine managed to maintain the momentum from Saturday's upset of New Mexico 
State for much of Thursday's game against UC Santa Barbara.But the few minutes 
the Anteaters let down proved disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters (7-18, 4-13), after taking a nine-point halftime lead by forcing 
11 turnovers, reverted to their midseason propensity for going scoreless for 
extended periods, and were outscored, 16-0, in the first five minutes of the 
second half in losing, 81-77, in a Big West game before 2,259 at the Bren 
Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Brown (22 points) led a furious rally from a 20-point, second-half 
deficit before Santa Barbara (13-15, 9-8) held on to win. JOHN WEYLER

LONG BEACH FENDS OFF RALLY BY FULLERTON TO WIN, 96-87 
</P>

<P>
 Long Beach State overcame a sloppy first half and a late rally by Cal State 
Fullerton to defeat the Titans, 96-87, Thursday at Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach, 16-9 and 10-7 in the Big West, outscored Fullerton (7-18, 5-12), 
13-2, in a little less than two minutes midway through the second half to lead, 
70-56, with 9:10 remaining. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Juaquin Hawkins gave the 49ers a big boost, scoring seven points 
during the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton did not fold in the stretch, however, closing to within 86-81 with 
2:09 left on two free throws by James French. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach led, 33-32, by halftime, but was far from impressive. Neither team 
managed much in the way of consistency in a sloppy first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach's biggest lead was 8-4, but Fullerton switched from a man-to-man to 
a zone and the 49er lead didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton went on a 16-8 run to lead, 22-16, after two free throws by Fred 
Amos with 7:37 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's game was a far cry from the teams' last meeting, a 91-69 Long Beach 
victory Jan. 29. ELLIOTT TEAFORD

SWIMMING / PACIFIC 10 CHAMPIONSHIPS; STANFORD TAKES COMMAND; UCLA SECOND, USC 
THIRD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 It was an image that typified Stanford's dominance of the Pacific 10 
Conference men's swimming championships Thursday night at the Belmont Plaza 
Pool in Long Beach: 
</P>
<P>
 Five of the six men who took their marks for the finals of the 200-yard 
individual medley wore the red of the Cardinal. The only other finalist was 
from USC. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford won four of five swimming events, including the 200 IM, to take a 
commanding lead on the first of three nights of competition with 307 points. 
UCLA was second with 188 points and USC, boosted by Brian Earley's sweep of all 
three diving events last week, was third with 164 points. 
</P>
<P>
 But it is clear that the team race is for second place. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford, the two-time defending NCAA champion, is looking for its 13th 
consecutive Pac-10 title. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford Coach Skip Kenney is using the meet to build momentum for the NCAA 
championships. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford looked confident in winning the 400 medley relay in a meet-record 3 
minutes 11.93 seconds. In that race, leadoff swimmer Derek Weatherford swam his 
100-backstroke leg in 47.14, the fastest time in the nation this season in the 
100 backstroke. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanford's B squad finished second in the event in 3:15.05.  
</P>
<P>
 In other events, Weatherford, the defending NCAA champion in the 100 
backstroke, won the 200 IM in 1:45.81 seconds.  
</P>
<P>
 The only event Stanford did not win was the 500 freestyle, which Arizona's 
Chad Carvin won in 4:20.62, edging USC freshman Kent Johnson by 0.66 seconds.

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Southern Section is hoping a change of venue to the new Anaheim Arena will 
bring needed attention to its boys' basketball championship games this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been difficult for fans to follow the expanded format of 10 title games 
in recent years because they have been spread out at a variety of sites and 
times. 
</P>
<P>
 The section will hold six of its games at Anaheim Arena on Saturday, beginning 
at 9:30 a.m. with the Division III-A final between San Dimas and Garden Grove 
Pacifica and continuing through with the I-A game between Santa Ana Mater Dei 
and Huntington Beach Edison at 8:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The section's major-division title games have been played at the Sports Arena 
since 1986, but conflicts with the USC men's basketball team often caused havoc 
with the schedule. Before Anaheim Arena opened, the Southern Section was one of 
its first tenants. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a catch for fans, however. The section is splitting the games into 
two sessions. A ticket to the first session will cover the III-A, III-AA, II-A 
and II-AA championships. The arena will be cleared for the evening portion,

CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
<P>
 * Today's pairings (at Cerritos Gahr High): Boys' Division I -- Claremont 
(19-6-4) vs. Upland (22-4-4), 8 p.m.; Boys' Division IV -- Moorpark (26-2-1) 
vs. Calabasas (13-3-2), 4 p.m.; Girls' Division I -- Huntington Beach Marina 
(27-0-1) vs. Palos Verdes Peninsula (23-1-3), 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year's champions: Boys' Division I -- Redlands; Boys' Division V -- 
Santa Paula; Girls' Division I -- Claremont and Huntington Beach Marina 
(co-champions). 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Two days of championship games begin with finals in three 
divisions. There are some familiar faces, with the Calabasas boys and Marina 
girls making return visits. Calabasas lost to Santa Paula, 2-1, in last year's 
championship match. Marina tied Claremont, 1-1. Calabasas will face Moorpark, a 
team it trailed in the Frontier League this season. Marina takes on Peninsula. 
The boys' Division I final features surprising Baseline League foes Claremont 
and Upland, which finished behind La Verne Damien in league play and were not 
seeded in the playoffs. STATE WRESTLING CHAMPIONSHIPS 
</P>
<P>
 * Today's schedule (at University of Pacific, Stockton) -- First round, 9 
a.m.; second round, 1 p.m.; third round, 5 p.m. Saturday's schedule -- 
Semifinals, 10 a.m.; finals, 7 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 * Last year's team results -- 1. Santa Ana Calvary Chapel, 79 points; 2. 
Shingle Springs Ponderosa, 72; 3. Fresno Clovis, 65; 4. College Park, 56; 5. 
Montebello Schurr, 55. 
</P>
<P>
 * Outlook: Calvary Chapel edged Ponderosa to win the team title in an exciting 
State tournament last year, but it's not expected to be as close this time. 
Calvary Chapel should easily retain its title with eight wrestlers competing. 
Clovis qualified five, and Ponderosa is one of several teams with four. Three 
of Calvary Chapel's wrestlers, Shane and Dane Valdez and Ed Mosley, placed in 
State competition last year. Dane won the 119-pound weight class and will 
compete at 125 this weekend. Eric Guerrero of Independence (125) and Casey 
Strand of College Park (171) are two other returning champions. Each has moved 
up a weight class, with Guerrero wrestling at 130 and Strand at 189.

COLLEGE BASKETBALL ROUNDUP; ARIZONA GETS PAY-BACK, PRESSING WASHINGTON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Washington upset Arizona in February, the Huskies played close to a 
perfect game. They turned the ball over only 11 times. 
</P>
<P>
 Arizona had something to do with that and decided not to repeat its error 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Wildcats pressed Washington all over the McKale Center in Tucson, 
generating 11 Husky turnovers in the first 9:09, 19 in the first half and 30 in 
the 95-62 Pacific 10 Conference victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Ray Owes was one of the beneficiaries of that defensive intensity by 
eighth-ranked Arizona, scoring a career-high 25 points, many off steals and 
Washington mistakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Khalid Reeves had 28 points as the Wildcats (24-4, 13-3) won their seventh in 
a row since losing, 74-69, at Washington on Feb. 5. Reeves' backcourt mate, 
Damon Stoudamire, scored only three points, 15 below his average, but had 11 
assists and four steals. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington (5-19, 3-12) shot nearly 67% in the first half but was behind, 
50-32. 
</P>
<P>
 "Turnovers killed us," Husky Coach Bob Bender said. "Not only the number, but 
that they probably turned 60% of them into buckets. We can't turn it over that 
many times at this level and have a legitimate chance of winning." 
</P>
<P>
 No. 9 Purdue 86, No. 18 Minnesota 70 -- Glenn Robinson, the leading scorer in 
Division I, had 31 points at West Lafayette, Ind., where the Boilermakers kept 
their hopes for a Big Ten championship alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Robinson, who brought a 29.3 average into the game, added 12 rebounds in 
recording his 15th double-double of the season as Purdue (24-4, 12-4) moved 
within half a game of Michigan by beating Minnesota (19-10, 9-7) for the 12th 
consecutive time at home. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 12 Kansas 97, Iowa State 79 -- Richard Scott had a career-high 24 points 
to lead the Jayhawks, and Greg Ostertag broke Danny Manning's school season 
record for blocked shots with 73. 
</P>
<P>
 Three seniors, Scott, Steve Woodberry and Patrick Richey, made their final 
shots at Lawrence, Kan., for the Jayhawks (23-6, 8-5) in the Big Eight game. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Hoiberg had 24 points for Iowa State (13-12, 3-10), which has lost 28 of 
its last 30 games at Lawrence. 
</P>
<P>
 No. 20 California 82, Oregon 73 -- Jason Kidd surpassed the Pac-10 season 
record for assists and Lamond Murray scored 26 points for the Bears at 
Berkeley. 
</P>
<P>
 Kidd had five assists and has 249 this season, breaking the record of 247 set 
by Arizona's Russell Brown in the 1978-79 season. Kidd also had 25 points for 
California (20-6, 11-4). Orlando Williams scored 22 for Oregon (6-18, 2-13). 
</P>
<P>
 No. 24 Alabama Birmingham 84, Dayton 53 -- Robert Shannon scored 29 points, 
including five three-pointers, for the Blazers (21-6, 7-4, who beat the Flyers 
(6-19, 1-11) in a Great Midwest game at Birmingham. OTHER GAMES Dion Cross 
scored 16 points and Brent Williams and Darren Allaway each had 14 to lead 
Stanford (15-9, 8-7) to a 90-66 victory over Oregon State (6-18, 2-13) in a 
Pac-10 game at Stanford. . . . Fred Ferguson scored 21 points and grabbed 16 
rebounds, and Nathan Erdmann added 20 points as Washington State (18-9, 8-7) 
won, 80-71, at Arizona State (13-12, 8-8). . . . Greg Brown scored 34 points 
and Marlow White added 22 as New Mexico (22-5, 14-3) claimed its first WAC 
championship since 1978 with an 84-82 overtime victory over Brigham Young 
(19-7, 13-4) at Provo, Utah. . . . James Dockery scored 19 points and grabbed 
10 rebounds to lead New Mexico State (20-6, 12-5) to an 86-73 overtime victory 
over Pacific (16-12, 10-7), giving the Aggies the Big West Conference 
championship. . . . Ryan Hoover and Keith Kurowski combined for the final 11 
points for Notre Dame (11-17) in a 66-64 victory over Loyola of Illinois (8-18) 
at Rosemont, Ill.

SANTA ANITA; A BAD BAD DAY FOR BIEN BIEN IN BIG 'CAP DRAW 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The owners of Bien Bien paid a $5,000 entry fee Thursday to get what one of 
them said was the worst post position for Saturday's $1-million Santa Anita 
Handicap. 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien, an excellent grass horse who would be returning to dirt, a surface 
on which he has won only once in seven tries, drew the No. 2 post in an 
eight-horse field. Whether that, and the high weight of 120 pounds, are enough 
to keep him from running probably won't be known until race day. Owners of Big 
'Cap horses must pay another $10,000 to start, with first place in the 1 
1/4-mile race worth $550,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "We took a chance (on entering), and it didn't turn out too good," said Trudy 
McCaffery, who races Bien Bien with John Toffan. "I think we got the worst post 
position we could possibly have." 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien is surrounded by what little speed there is in the 57th Big 'Cap. 
Hill Pass will break from the rail, and The Wicked North is on Bien Bien's 
other flank. Bien Bien, who has six victories and five seconds in 15 races and 
earnings of $1.6 million, usually runs from slightly off the pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Bien Bien might be the high weight, but The Wicked North, winner of the San 
Antonio Handicap three weeks ago and in the money 11 times in 13 starts, has 
been made the 2-1 morning-line favorite by track oddsmaker Jeff Tufts. Region, 
third in the San Antonio, his first race in more than three months, is next at 
7-2, followed by Bien Bien at 4-1. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's the field, with jockeys, weights and odds: Hill Pass, Chris McCarron, 
115 pounds, 8-1; Bien Bien, Laffit Pincay, 120, 4-1; The Wicked North, Kent 
Desormeaux, 118, 2-1; Nonproductiveasset, Corey Nakatani, 116, 6-1; Myrakalu, 
Alex Solis, 113, 30-1; Stuka, Chris Antley, 115, 8-1; Region, Eddie 
Delahoussaye, 116; 7-2, and Kissin Kris, Jerry Bailey, 119, 8-1. 
</P>
<P>
 With a composite record of three victories in 16 starts this year, the field 
will not be an echo of 1988, when Alysheba beat Ferdinand by a half-length in a 
battle of Kentucky Derby winners; or of 1940, when Seabiscuit won the Big 'Cap 
with 130 pounds on his back. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, trainer Wally Dollase, who claimed Nonproductiveasset from Ted West for 
$40,000 at Hollywood Park last May, is thrilled to be in the race. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I got this horse, I sure didn't think I'd be here with him," Dollase 
said. "I'm overwhelmed to be in a race with such owners as Claiborne Farm 
(Region), John Franks (Kissin Kris) and Allen Paulson (Stuka)." 
</P>
<P>
 Nonproductiveasset, a 4-year-old gelding, races in the name of Richard 
Stephen, the Manhattan Beach owner of a $100-million-a-year women's apparel 
business, and his 2-year-old grandson. Before acquiring Nonproductiveasset, 
Stephen shared in some of Dollase's best bargain-basement purchases: Journalism 
earned more than $300,000 after Dollase bought him for $50,000; Supah Gem, a 
$110,000 investment, beat double Eclipse Award winner Paseana in last month's 
Santa Maria Handicap, and Boating Pleasure, a $40,000 claim, won the $100,000 
California Cup Juvenile in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Boating Pleasure wasn't really that good of a horse," Dollase said. "But he 
won the big race when it counted." 
</P>
<P>
 Of some concern to Dollase Saturday is that Nonproductiveasset might be 
another model of Itsallgreektome, a $75,000 yearling who ran second in both the 
1990 Breeders' Cup Mile and 1991 Breeders' Cup Turf. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a certain amount of second-itis to this horse, too," Dollase said. 
"But he's already got a good mile-and-a-quarter race under his belt, and that 
should help. He's not a good work horse, but I worked him with another horse 
the other day and he gave us a super work (1:01 4/5 for five furlongs). The 
Wicked North should give us something to run at. If a claiming horse won this 
race, that would really be history." 
</P>
<P>
 None of the Big 'Cap horses have won at 1 1/4 miles on dirt, but at least 
Nonproductiveasset was second, beaten by a nose by Diazo in the Strub Stakes. 
Diazo might have been favored Saturday, but he cracked a cannon bone in a 
workout last Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Not surprisingly, Corey Nakatani, Dollase's son-in-law, has opted to ride 
Nonproductiveasset. Nakatani also rode Region to three stakes victories last 
year and was aboard for the 5-year-old gelding's encouraging return in the San 
Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Nakatani's decision left trainer Richard Mandella with Eddie Delahoussaye to 
ride Region. 
</P>
<P>
 Delahoussaye, 42, might be 0 for 12 in the Big 'Cap, but his mounts have won 
eight $1-million races, including two in the Breeders' Cup at Santa Anita last 
fall.

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; ASTACIO CLEARED AFTER HEART TESTS

 Right-hander Pedro Astacio was cleared to pitch Thursday after undergoing 
tests this week because of a heart murmur. Team physician Michael Mellman said 
that he detected the murmur in Astacio during his routine physical at 
Dodgertown, Feb. 24 and 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "In retrospect, it was an innocent finding," Mellman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Astacio is expected to begin throwing again on Monday -- with the only holdup 
being a sore groin caused by one of the tests.

 Second baseman Delino DeShields, who suffered a broken left cheekbone 
Wednesday when he was hit by a bat, returned to the clubhouse and is expected 
to resume workouts today. DeShields had no swelling but said his face was sore. 
He can begin playing in games once he gets a protective mask, which should take 
about a week.

 With winds blowing near 35 m.p.h., Todd Worrell was hit hard in an intrasquad 
game Thursday, giving up a three-run home run to Tim Wallach, a two-run homer 
to Mike Piazza and a single and double to Eric Karros. Worrell said he felt 
fine, but said he was battling the wind. "I didn't really get anything out of 
it," Worrell said. "The wind was blowing so hard." Worrell gave up six runs, 
five hits and three walks in two innings. . . . It was 43 degrees with the 
wind-chill factor. . . . In DeShields' absence, Mike Sharperson, who is trying 
to make the team, started at second base for the regulars. . . . Kevin Gross, 
who is recovering from mild tendinitis in his right shoulder, threw to hitters 
for the first time this spring. He reported no discomfort and plans to pitch 
two innings in Tuesday's game. . . . The Dodgers open their exhibition season 
today with a game against the New York Mets at Port St. Lucie. . . . Former 
General Manager Al Campanis is visiting Dodgertown. MARYANN HUDSON

UCI REVERTS TO FORM IN LOSS; MEN'S BASKETBALL: ANTEATERS GO COLD, THEN FURIOUS 
RALLY FALLS SHORT, AND UC SANTA BARBARA WINS, 81-77. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 UC Irvine managed to maintain the momentum from Saturday's upset of New Mexico 
State for much of Thursday night's game against UC Santa Barbara. But the few 
minutes the Anteaters let down proved disastrous. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters' pressure defense forced the Gauchos into 11 first-half 
turnovers and they led by nine at halftime. But Irvine, reverting to its 
midseason propensity for going scoreless for extended periods, was outscored 
16-0 in the first five minutes of the second half and lost, 81-77, in front of 
2,259 at the Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine (7-18, 4-13 in the Big West) trailed by as many as 20 points (66-46) 
with 5:48 remaining, but summoned a furious rally down the stretch and Chris 
Brown came inches from tying the score when his three-point attempt rattled off 
the rim with 30.2 seconds left. 
</P>
<P>
 "We let another one slip away," Brown said. "I guess maybe we were a little 
relaxed. We didn't come out in the second half like we did at the beginning of 
the game. Then we really went strong in the last four or five minutes, but it 
was a little bit too late." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown, the nation's most prolific three-point shooter, made seven of 18 and 
finished with 22 points. But the Anteaters' outside game could not overcome the 
Gauchos' inside game. Center Doug Muse made seven of nine shots and nine of 11 
free throws for 23 points and Santa Barbara (13-15, 9-8) shot 59% from the 
floor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Gauchos' front-line players were 16 of 23 from the field and helped Santa 
Barbara to a 37-29 rebounding advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had a great deal of success with our press after we made baskets in the 
first half," Irvine Coach Rod Baker said. "But you need to make shots to get 
into the pressure and at the beginning of the second half we didn't make many 
shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara appeared on its way to rout after outscoring Irvine, 41-12, but 
the Anteaters scrambled back. Still, the Gauchos appeared to have a comfortable 
14-point bulge with 2:51 left to play. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Odsather single-handedly brought the crowd and the Anteater bench back 
into the game, however, scoring eight points in a seven-second span with a pair 
of three-pointers and two free throws. Brown followed a Shaun Battle dunk with 
a 25-foot three-pointer and then another over two defenders and Irvine trailed 
by only two (76-74) with 1:07 left. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillip Turner had a chance to seal the victory for Santa Barbara but missed a 
pair of free throws with 30 seconds left and then Brown's 18th three-point 
attempt was a little too strong and bounced off the hoop. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters are living and dying on the shooting fortunes of Brown these 
days and the junior guard is a marked man. The Anteaters believe he is being 
manhandled away from the ball and Brown drew is third foul near the end of the 
second half when he lashed out in retaliation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brown is our best outside shooter," Baker said. "I have no idea how many 
shots he took tonight or how many he made. But we're not only living and dying 
on Brownie's ability to shoot the ball, but on our ability to get into the 
press. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our offense hurt us a lot more than our defense. When we don't make our 
shots, we can't get into our pressure. And remember, they weren't twiddling 
their thumbs at halftime. They made some adjustments and got back into it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Anteaters awoke from their sleepwalk too late to recover, but early enough 
to put a scare into the Gauchos. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I see Phillip (Turner) miss two free throws, when I see our best 
free-throw shooter miss two, I started thinking maybe the basketball genie 
wasn't on our side tonight," Muse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Barbara didn't need a magic lamp, however, thanks to Muse. The junior 
center made four free throws in a row in the final 17 seconds.

AND EQUIPMENT PROBLEMS SLOW PLAY BEFORE 49ERS STAGGER TO 96-87 VICTORY.

 The shot clock went haywire. The coaches went ballistic. Passes went flying 
out of control. Shots went everywhere but in the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton and Long Beach State, two young teams bent on 
self-destruction, played a strange, sloppy game Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach seemed to maintain its poise a bit better, though, and stumbled 
away with a 96-87 victory in Titan Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 The 49ers (16-9, 10-7 in the Big West) shot better than the Titans (7-18, 
5-12) from the field and made their free throws down the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach's 13-2 run midway through the second half opened some breathing 
room and the 49ers held off the Titans in the final minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Overall, it was a good win in a tough place to play," Long Beach Coach Seth 
Greenberg said after the 49ers' first victory in Titan Gym since 1991, 
Greenberg's first season as coach. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is going to help us down the road." 
</P>
<P>
 Rod Hannibal had a game-high 18 points and reserve Juaquin Hawkins added 16. 
Hawkins, a sophomore, had seven of the 49ers' 13 points during a two-minute 
span in which Long Beach increased its lead from 57-54 to 70-56. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton didn't fold in the stretch, however, closing to within 86-81 with 
2:09 left on two free throws by James French. 
</P>
<P>
 But Long Beach made six of eight free throws in the game's final 1 minute 12 
seconds to seal the victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played impressively against an excellent team," Titan Coach Brad Holland 
said. "The only thing we missed was we couldn't knock down any shots. We had 
good open shots that we just didn't knock down." 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton shot 50% for the game, but only 39.3 in the first half and trailed 
by just one at the half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We played well enough to win," Holland said after the Titans lost to Long 
Beach for the 10th time in their last 14 meetings. "If only we could have hit a 
few shots." 
</P>
<P>
 French led the Titans with 17 points, all but two in the second half, and 
Winston Peterson had 16 points and 12 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 For the most part, it was a forgettable night for both teams and the 983 who 
watched the 66th game between the rivals. 
</P>
<P>
 Little went right, including a shot clock that malfunctioned four times in the 
second half, causing delay after delay. That served only to enhance the 
sluggish play. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Greenberg nor Holland was happy and vented their anger at lead 
official Jim Stupin. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach led, 33-32, by halftime, but was far from impressive. Neither team 
was very consistent in a sloppy first half. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach's biggest lead was 8-4, but Fullerton switched from a man-to-man to 
a zone and the 49er lead didn't last long. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton went on a 16-8 run to lead, 22-16, after two free throws by Fred 
Amos with 7:37 left in the half. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a far cry from the teams' last game. Long Beach opened up a 44-27 
halftime lead en route to an easy, 91-69, victory on Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, the halftime box score gave Long Beach 10 turnovers, which seemed 
low considering the errant passes flying in all directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, which had eight turnovers at halftime, shot 39.3% from the field 
(11 for 28), but still managed to stay close. Fred Amos, a reserve forward, 
gave the Titans a boost with eight first-half points.

COLLEGE DIVISION NOTEBOOK / MARTIN BECK: VANGUARDS HAVE EXCEEDED EXPECTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Southern California College women's basketball Coach Dean Cooper had fairly 
modest expectations for the Vanguards before this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, in his second year as SCC coach, looked at the schedule and figured 
winning 18 or 19 games would be a good finish for the Vanguards, who qualified 
for their first postseason appearance in 1992-93. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it would take three years at least to turn it around," Cooper said. 
"I felt there was a good nucleus here and if I could pick up a few more 
players, we could be decent." 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out the Vanguards are much better than that. They won their 20th game 
with four games remaining in the regular season and have gone on from there. 
Wednesday, the Vanguards (24-7) won their first playoff game in the 15 years of 
the school's women's basketball program. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded SCC beat Cal Baptist, 80-57, in the first round of the Golden 
State Athletic Conference playoffs Wednesday and play at No. 2-seeded Azusa 
Pacific in the semifinals today. No. 5 Point Loma Nazarene, which beat 
Concordia, 72-71, plays at top-seeded Fresno Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 The winners will play for the title March 9 at the home court of the team with 
the higher seeding. The conference champion receives an automatic berth in the 
NAIA national championship, March 16-22 in Jackson, Tenn. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 SCC split its games with Azusa Pacific (20-9), beating the Cougars, 71-48, at 
home and losing, 73-70, at Azusa. Azusa Pacific is a strong team that leads the 
conference is rebounding, so Cooper expects a physical game. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's going to be a tough ballgame," Cooper said. "Especially on their floor. 
They play pretty tough there, but I think we are certainly capable of beating 
them." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gitte Mejer, a senior center from Aarhus, Denmark, completed her four-year 
career at Concordia by scoring 29 points in the loss to Point Loma Nazarene. 
</P>
<P>
 Mejer, 6 feet 2, was named Golden State Athletic Conference player of the year 
for a third consecutive season after leading the conference in scoring (24.6) 
and shooting percentage (63%) and was second in rebounding (9.8). She was named 
conference player of the week four of the eight times it was awarded. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's just a step above everybody else," Concordia Coach Sharon Campbell 
said. "When we (conference coaches) voted Sunday night, we didn't even have a 
debate." 
</P>
<P>
 Concordia, which won the previous two conference titles (1991-92 and 1992-93) 
and advanced to consecutive NAIA national tournaments, started the season 
slowly, losing its first four games. But after some midseason adjustments by 
Campbell, the Eagles improved steadily but were hampered by several key 
injuries and illnesses and finished fourth in the conference with a 5-5 record. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Turns out Ila Borders wasn't the first woman to pitch in a college baseball 
game, USA Today Baseball Weekly reported this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the NCAA and NAIA had no record of anyone before Borders, the 
newspaper reported that Jodi Haller pitched in 1990 for St. Vincent's College, 
an NAIA school in Latrobe, Pa. Haller, also left-handed, has since transferred 
to Shippensburg (Pa.) State, where she was cut from the baseball team last 
fall. No statistics are available for her season with St. Vincent's. 
</P>
<P>
 So Borders is now believed to be the fourth woman to play collegiate baseball 
and the second to pitch.

COLLEGE BASEBALL ROUNDUP; SCC, BORDERS LOSE TO UC SAN DIEGO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Despite victories in her first two collegiate starts, Southern California 
College's Ila Borders still had something to prove. 
</P>
<P>
 Claremont-Mudd and Concordia, her first victims, aren't considered strong 
hitting teams, so some discounted her 0.57 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, Borders got her shot at a quality team, UC San Diego, ranked eighth 
in NCAA Division III, and lost a 4-3 decision in Costa Mesa. 
</P>
<P>
 Borders (2-1) gave up four runs on six hits in seven innings. UC San Diego 
(7-2) scored three in the third and one in the fourth off Borders. She struck 
out two, walked two and hit a batter. 
</P>
<P>
 The performance prompted a testimonial from SCC Coach Charlie Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is for real," he said. "I don't care what anybody says or any coaches say 
to me. She is for real ." 
</P>
<P>
 Borders, whose ERA jumped to 1.99, said she was more nervous about pitching 
against UC San Diego than she was before her first start. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't want to compare them to anybody, but they are an extremely good 
team," Borders said. "You can't make any mistakes out there or they will just 
spank it." 
</P>
<P>
 UC San Diego Coach Lyle Yates said his team traditionally has had trouble 
scoring at SCC's field, so the Tritons prepared by taking batting practice 
against one of their slower-throwing left-handed pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Tritons got solid hits off Borders, including Chris Miyake, who drove 
in two runs with an opposite-field double in the third and Dan O'Brien, who 
drove in the final run with an opposite-field triple in the fourth. But San 
Diego managed only one more hit against Borders before reliever Rick Homutoff 
took over at the start of the eighth. 
</P>
<P>
 SCC (6-8), which had only four hits off two Triton pitchers, scored a run in 
the second and two in the fourth. The Vanguards got the leadoff batter aboard 
in three of the last five innings, but reliever Kurt Luhrsen (2-0), who allowed 
only one hit after entering in the fifth inning, was able to snuff out any 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
 In an exhibition game: 
</P>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton 4, Waseda (Japan) University 0 -- Jeff Ferguson had two 
hits, including a home run, and Bret Hemphill had a double and home run for 
host Cal State Fullerton.

 Talk about the mysteries of finance. Strange as it is for most folks to 
understand, the strengthening U.S. economy is being blamed for the unsettling 
drop in stock and bond prices as interest rates have risen dramatically in 
recent weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Each day's good economic news seems to rattle the financial markets -- and 
Thursday was no exception. Government reports that unemployment claims fell 
while factory orders rose were cited by analysts to explain further declines in 
the value of bonds and stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 What is going on? Are we at a turning point, as some analysts believe, where 
fears of inflation and a fragile global financial system are about to send the 
markets -- and the economy -- into a long decline? 
</P>
<P>
 No, say the great majority of economic and financial experts. The markets, as 
they usually do, are reacting to fears that economic expansion will bring 
increased inflation and rising interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 But this time market fears appear to be overblown. What is really happening is 
that the U.S. economy is expanding in a very healthy way, with rising 
productivity and without more inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 And that healthy expansion could continue for some years, according to Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who surprised analysts a month ago when he 
raised short-term interest rates. The markets reaction to that move has been 
extraordinary, but analysts now believe that Greenspan's purpose may not have 
been the usual inflation-fighting action but part of a strategy to deflate the 
threat of an international speculative bubble. 
</P>
<P>
 The activities of major global investors, swinging massive amounts of borrowed 
capital in international securities and currency markets, threatened to become 
a destabilizing force. These so-called "hedge funds" made huge bets early this 
year that interest rates on Japanese and European bonds would continue to drop 
and that the Japanese yen would weaken. But their investments, more than $300 
billion by some estimates, distorted bond markets in Europe and Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 To counter this potentially dangerous speculation, according to a growing 
consensus among financial professionals, Greenspan raised U.S. rates, thus 
affecting European and Japanese markets. This caused the hedge fund bets to go 
wrong, with billions of dollars in losses. The resultant sell-offs of their 
holdings have contributed to market gyrations, many traders say. 
</P>
<P>
 That explains the violent reaction in U.S. stock and bond markets to 
Greenspan's small quarter-point hike in U.S. interest rates, to 3.25% from 3%. 
Since Feb. 4, nervous traders have driven up the rate on the U.S. Treasury's 
30-year bond, the instrument that influences most mortgages and business and 
consumer borrowing, to 6.83% from 6.3%. In the super-sensitive world of the 
financial markets, that's a dramatic rise, "one of the fastest in 40 years," 
according to John Isaacson, research director of Payden & Rygel, a Los Angeles 
investment firm specializing in fixed income securities. 
</P>
<P>
 But with ordinary home mortgages and mutual funds being affected by distant 
events, investors are worried. Many wonder whether this is a rerun of 1973 when 
a quadrupling in the price of oil sparked raging inflation and sent stocks into 
a long decline. Or is it 1987 all over again, when the markets crashed amid 
mounting trade tension and an overheating economy? 
</P>
<P>
 This time is not at all like those earlier periods. The U.S. economy and 
financial markets are not on the brink of a long decline. On the contrary, the 
economy has turned from its long recovery from the recession of 1990-91 into an 
expansion. Economists now predict 3.6% growth this year, or an additional $216 
billion worth of economic activity. California may not join fully in such 
growth until early next year, although a better national economy could quicken 
the pace here. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of economic growth creates jobs, and in fact most predictions are 
that this morning's unemployment report will be favorable. Yet increased 
inflation is not seen as a real threat because productivity, up more than 4% 
last year, is growing across the board. Both in manufacturing and services 
industries, U.S. business is getting more output per dollar of investment or 
hour of labor these days. And that means low or decreasing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, change is in the air, not decline. The economies of Europe and Asia are 
adjusting to the post-Cold War period, as the U.S. economy has been doing since 
1990. Though the effort to change Japan's has led to a very public dispute, it 
is not likely to upset an increasingly interdependent and growing world 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast with earlier periods of economic change and market volatility is 
dramatic. In 1973, the start of a bear market saw a quadrupling in the price of 
oil and the instability of Watergate in the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, then Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker was forced to bail out 
U.S. and international banks that had become overextended in the 
inflation-driven speculations in silver, oil and other commodities. He also had 
to take stern action, and trigger a recession, to break the back of 
double-digit inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan, who acted quickly to curb the market slide in 1987, may have made a 
timely move again. He stepped in to curb hedge fund speculation before banks 
and markets were truly threatened. Some financial professionals disagreed with 
his action, saying in effect that the normal workings of markets would have 
resolved difficulties. 
</P>
<P>
 But markets typically go to extremes before speculation is reversed, in a 
resounding crash with the collapse of brokerage houses and threatened failures 
of banks. It is when bank failure is threatened that economies are truly 
disrupted. As with Volcker in 1980, the Federal Reserve has to step in with 
emergency funds, distorting and inflating the economy. 
</P>
<P>
 No crash seemed imminent in the current situation, but there was a halt in 
trading Wednesday in the stock of Bankers Trust New York, one of the leading 
dealers in interest rates swaps and other mechanisms of what are called 
financial derivatives, so that reports of trouble could be dispelled. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even the fact that the economy could be threatened by excesses of hedge 
funds and deal making in obscure financial instruments like interest rate 
swaps, will strike most people as inexplicable. If hedge funds are a threat, 
why are they allowed at all? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that hedge funds are just a part of a new and still-emerging 
global financial system in which more than $1 trillion of securities, 
currencies and all manner of financial instruments are traded every day, with 
benefits for all. "The trading is maximizing the efficiency of capital 
movements, bringing together money that is available in one spot but required 
in another," says Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of J.P. Morgan & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, financing for the development of countries like Mexico, China and 
Indonesia is possible because this immense financial market allows risk to be 
spread, Weatherstone and others explain. 
</P>
<P>
 Risk is spread, typically, by swapping -- reducing the risk of a long-term 
loan to finance a factory in China, say, by trading it for a security that has 
a floating rate of interest. Trading it to whom? Perhaps to one of the hedge 
funds, which would accept the risk of long-term interest as part of its "bet" 
on the general direction of rates. 
</P>
<P>
 The dangers in this new world of finance are evident in the example: What if 
the factory doesn't get built on time, and its output is not then available to 
pay the loan? What if interest rates go against the direction bet on by the 
hedge fund?  
</P>
<P>
 "The consequence would be failure of the loan or bankruptcy of the hedge 
fund," says Patricia Klink, president of Advisers Capital Management, a New 
York-based investment firm. 
</P>
<P>
 That's acceptable so long as the bankruptcies don't get too large and their 
consequences don't spread too far. One reason for the volatility in stock and 
bond markets today is that Fed Chairman Greenspan stepped in to prevent things 
from going too far. 
</P>
<P>
 As the dramatic effects of his action play out, ordinary investors and 
mortgage holders are advised to keep an eye on the underlying strength of the 
U.S. economy and not be diverted by the froth on the top.

 PROXY VOTE? Democrats went outside the party for Saturday's keynote speaker at 
their state convention in Anaheim. He's UC Irvine writing teacher Thomas 
Keneally, who's hot this year as author of "Schindler's List," the Holocaust 
novel made into the Steven Spielberg movie. . . . Keneally is politically 
active in his native Australia, but he's not a U.S. citizen.Says his daughter 
Jane, however: "If my father could vote in the U.S., you can bet he'd be a 
Democrat."

 NAME GAME: "Night and Her Stars," which premieres tonight at South Coast 
Repertory (F31), takes its name from a phrase by Ralph Waldo Emerson. But its 
working title, "Ecstatic Air," almost made the marquee instead. SCR wanted to 
use it. Playwright Richard Greenberg didn't. . . . "I couldn't wait to get rid 
of it," he says. "It was totally pretentious. My definition of a working title 
is a title that doesn't work." The play dramatizes the TV quiz-show scandals of 
the '50s.

 THREE STRIKES: The state Senate has approved a version of the "three strikes 
and you're out" bill aimed at imprisoning repeat offenders (A1). . . . The bill 
proposes mandatory life sentences for third-time felons who have committed two 
prior serious crimes. It goes next to Gov. Pete Wilson, who has said he will 
sign it. . . . Some prosecutors, including Ventura County Dist. Atty. Michael 
D. Bradbury, prefer a different bill that does not count juvenile convictions. 
The Senate-approved bill "has some potential flaws," Bradbury said. "But it's 
certainly better than nothing."

"Rectilinear shapes are still very strong in architecture," said Catherine

SENATE REJECTS WILSON'S CHOICE FOR UC REGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Breaking a 125-year tradition, the state Senate on Thursday upheld the 
rejection of an appointee to the University of California Board of Regents when 
it closed the door on the nomination of the first Chinese American to serve on 
the powerful panel. 
</P>
<P>
 It was a setback for Gov. Pete Wilson, whose appointment of Lester Lee, a 
Saratoga businessman, to the university's 26-member governing board was 
rejected Monday by the Senate Rules Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the final day for action on the appointment, Senate Republicans 
sought to bring the nomination to a vote before the full Senate. But in a 
partisan vote, they could not withdraw Lee's appointment from the committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee is the first regents' nominee ever rejected by the Senate, according to 
university and Senate officials. Until this week, the only regents nominee who 
did not win confirmation was railroad magnate and politician Leland Stanford, 
who in 1883 withdrew his appointment in the face of Democratic opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 The spirited debate over whether the 62-year-old Lee should remain on the 
board mixed politics, race and the university's direction. 
</P>
<P>
 In opposing Lee, Democrats cited his willingness to go along with steep 
increases in students fees, which have jumped 113% to $3,400 a year since 1990, 
and raises for administrators. They contrasted his low-key style with another 
Wilson appointee, African American businessman Ward Connerly of Sacramento, 
whose nomination was approved Monday. Regents serve 12-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contrast was fairly dramatic," said new Senate President Pro Tem Bill 
Lockyer (D-Hayward). "They were both Republican contributors, friends of Pete 
Wilson but Connerly is willing to be critical of the university as an 
institution and Mr. Lee seems not to be willing to do that." 
</P>
<P>
 The rejection of Lee suggests that appointees of Republican Wilson, who is 
seeking reelection this year, will face a closer look by the 
Democratic-controlled upper chamber. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there is any change that this vote represents," Lockyer said, "(it) is 
that we do not intend to routinely rubber-stamp any governor's nominations, 
that we expect to offer some independent judgment about these appointments." 
</P>
<P>
 Although it was a setback for Wilson, it was a victory of sorts for Sen. Tom 
Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who for the past year has pressed his colleagues to 
make the regents more accountable for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's vote -- technically on a procedural question -- was a tough one for 
some Senate Democrats who face election this year in districts with heavy 
concentrations of Asian American voters. The upper chamber voted 19 to 15 to 
reject a request by Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno to withdraw Lee's 
name from the Rules Committee so the appointment could be considered by the 
full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, an immigrant, was named to the board a year ago and was allowed to serve 
for the full year without Senate approval. He earned a Ph.D. in mechanical 
engineering from Stanford University, and in 1970 started his own company, 
which supplies high-tech magnetic tape testing equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Trouble for his nomination began to surface last month when the California 
Federation of Teachers announced its opposition, maintaining that middle-class 
Californians might soon be unable to afford to send their children to the 
university. 
</P>
<P>
 The opposition, which apparently caught Republican legislators off-guard, 
prompted Lee to rally support among Asian American groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee could not be reached after Thursday's vote, but after Monday's action by 
the Rules Committee, he defended his support of a student fee increase, saying 
it was based on the university's overall budget plan allowing the system "to 
operate at close to current levels" and "for the best interest of the 
university." 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement, he said, "Everyone knows that Asians, especially Chinese, have 
been historically underrepresented. This action appears to be deliberately done 
by elected officials who hide behind partisan politics to deny a qualified 
Chinese American candidate from serving in the public interest." 
</P>
<P>
 University spokesman Mike Lassiter said that about 9% of the student body on 
all UC campuses are Chinese Americans. At least one other Asian American 
currently sits on the governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republican Leader Maddy voiced disappointment that Lee must step down 
from the board. 
</P>
<P>
 During a lively Senate floor debate, he hailed Lee as a superbly qualified 
appointee "who epitomizes the success that immigrants and racial and ethnic 
minorities can achieve in this country." 
</P>
<P>
 He said the board "cries out for a regent who knows first-hand how to overcome 
linguistic and cultural barriers" and who "represents a role model for all 
Californians, regardless of their ethnic or cultural background." 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden, a Democratic candidate for governor, however, criticized Republicans 
for raising the race issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we should be pushed into approving a regent on those grounds 
alone," he said. "And it strikes me as extremely odd that Republicans would use 
affirmative action as an argument. . . . I think the governor or Sen. Maddy 
trying to play the race card is a terrible mistake." 
</P>
<P>
 J. P. Tremblay, a Wilson spokesman, scoffed at the suggestion Republicans were 
injecting race into the debate. After Monday's committee vote, Wilson said the 
action left him dumbfounded, and cited the need for the regents to be more 
ethnically and racially diverse.

CONFESSION IN ABORTION DOCTOR'S DEATH DESCRIBED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The prosecution's final witness against a man accused of fatally shooting an 
abortion doctor testified Thursday that she overheard him admit that he killed 
Dr. David Gunn "to save a baby." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael F. Griffin confessed to his wife during a jailhouse visit the day 
after Gunn was shot and killed last March 10, said Escambia County Corrections 
Officer Brenda Fuqua. 
</P>
<P>
 She said Patricia Griffin asked her husband why he did it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said he didn't do it for any notoriety or any public recognition," Fuqua 
said. "He said he killed him because of his beliefs and convictions and, if he 
had to go to jail for the rest of his life to save a baby, it would be worth 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gunn, 47, of Eufaula, Ala., was shot three times in the back as he arrived for 
work at Pensacola Women's Medical Services as the clinic was being picketed by 
anti-abortion protesters. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense began presenting its case later in the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Fuqua said she did not report what she had heard until Feb. 17 -- 11 months 
after the crime -- because she was unsure whether it was privileged 
information. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense had objected to her testimony before the trial but dropped that 
challenge in exchange for a prosecution agreement not to seek the death 
penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 If convicted of first-degree murder, Griffin, 32, would be sentenced to life 
in prison without parole for at least 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Thursday, two prosecution experts testified that Griffin had a telltale 
element on his hands after the shooting, but they were unable to positively say 
it came from gunfire residue. 
</P>
<P>
 The level of antimony on his hands was significant but too low to be 
conclusive, said Daniel Radcliffe of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement 
and Irving Stone of Dallas County's crime laboratory in Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Windy conditions and the 33 minutes that passed between the time of the 
shooting and the swabbing of Griffin's hands in a police car probably reduced 
the antimony level, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 On cross-examination by defense lawyer Robert Kerrigan, Radcliffe agreed that 
it was possible that Griffin could have gotten antimony on his hands at the 
nylon manufacturing plant where he was a chemical worker.

 Rep. William H. Natcher's record of never missing a vote in his 40-year House 
career ended Thursday when the 84-year-old Kentucky Democrat was too sick to 
leave the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 His streak of 18,401 consecutive votes on the House floor has never been 
approached, and House Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) said it was a record "I 
believe will stand forever. Obviously this is a sad moment for all of us 
because of the unparalleled public service of Mr. Natcher." 
</P>
<P>
 House members gave a standing ovation for their absent colleague, who began 
serving in Congress in January, 1954, and is now chairman of the House 
Appropriations Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton visited Natcher's hospital room Thursday and presented him 
the Presidential Citizen's Medal, the nation's second-highest civilian award. 
</P>
<P>
 House Library records show that Natcher cast his first vote on Jan. 21, 1954 
-- in favor of establishing an Air Force academy. 
</P>
<P>
 The end came on a simple procedural vote that opened the House session 
Thursday. His last four votes Wednesday were his most difficult, with the frail 
octogenarian, suffering from intestinal and other ailments, being wheeled onto 
the House floor on a hospital gurney, complete with oxygen and intravenous 
tubes. 
</P>
<P>
 The day before, House leaders had agreed to suspend all legislative action at 
Natcher's request so the streak could be maintained. 
</P>
<P>
 Natcher has advised new members against trying to emulate him. "When you've 
been here as long as I have and never missed a day or vote, it's right around 
your neck," he once said. 
</P>
<P>
 Often it was not easy. His wife, Virginia, died in 1991 after 53 years of 
marriage. When she was seriously ill, he routinely flew home to be with her and 
then back to Washington the next day, day after day, to keep the streak going. 
Voting even kept him from making an appearance when President Jimmy Carter 
visited his district in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Natcher issued a statement Thursday that said after consulting with his 
physicians, "I have very reluctantly decided to remain at Bethesda Naval 
Hospital for continued treatment, and I will not be able to return to Capitol 
Hill today. 
</P>
<P>
 "Throughout my entire public service," he said in the statement, "I have never 
missed a single day of work, and during my tenure as a member of Congress, I 
never missed a day or a vote."

ANITA MORRIS; ACTRESS IN MUSICALS, FILM COMEDIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRNA OLIVER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Anita Morris, an actress best known for show-stopping performance in the 
Broadway musical "Nine" and as a femme fatale in the film "A Sinful Life," has 
died. She was 50. 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Morris died Wednesday of cancer at her home in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Growing up in Durham, N.C., Miss Morris quickly became known for her 
voluptuous figure, acrobatic dancing and flair for comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 She made her Broadway debut in "Jesus Christ Superstar," where she met her 
husband, director and choreographer Grover Dale. She went on to success in the 
musical comedies "The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas," "Sugar Babies," 
"Seesaw," "The Magic Show" and "Rachel Lily Rosenbloom." 
</P>
<P>
 She won stellar notice as she was approaching the age of 40 in Tommy Tune's 
"Nine," contorting in a sheer black lace body stocking to the humorously 
seductive song, "Call to the Vatican." Censors excised the act from the 1982 
Tony Awards telecast, but "Nine" still won the Tony for best musical and the 
number still won Miss Morris television and movie roles. 
</P>
<P>
 In his critique of "A Sinful Life" in 1989, Times reviewer Michael Wilmington 
said: "Dancer-actress Anita Morris, with her torrid red mane and outrageously 
voluptuous torso, comes close to being the human equivalent of Roger Rabbit's 
Jessica. She can turn herself into an incarnation of all-American pneumatic 
sex. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 'A Sinful Life,' " he wrote, "Morris has exactly the right kind of role. 
She plays a sexy, soused, self-parodying dream-goddess of chintzy lust." 
</P>
<P>
 Last year Miss Morris played the Contessa Laetita Gabetti in the NBC 
miniseries "Trade Winds." 
</P>
<P>
 Miss Morris' screen credits also include "The Happy Hooker" in 1975, "The 
Hotel New Hampshire" in 1984, "Ruthless People" in 1986 and the yet-to-be 
released "Radioland Murders." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to her husband, Miss Morris is survived by their son, James.

MIKE PENNER: EX-TITAN GETS HIS LIFE, LIVES OF OTHERS ON TRACK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Cut by the Oakland Raiders. Frozen out of the Canadian Football League. Cut 
again by the Buffalo Bills. Leonard King was down to his fourth and final shot 
at a career in professional football -- a tryout with the Oakland Invaders of 
the USFL -- and he was desperate. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't in shape," King remembers, "so I started training on steroids and 
cocaine." 
</P>
<P>
 Steroids to build his biceps, cocaine to amp his energy level for marathon 
bench-press sessions in the weight room. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was trying to go 24 hours, around the clock," King says. "I really wanted 
to make it this time." 
</P>
<P>
 Frank Merriwell never stocked his training table that way, and it didn't take 
long for King to discover why. King's tryout with the Invaders lasted less than 
a week, which ended with King lying in a hospital bed at San Francisco General. 
</P>
<P>
 "My liver almost burst," King says. "I barely could eat, I had so much liver 
damage. They kept me there under observation for a week, and after that, I had 
to go back for treatment for months." 
</P>
<P>
 A year later, in 1984, King was out of football. His career ended, in 
anonymity, as an offensive lineman with the semi-pro Orange County Rhinos, a 
far cry from his days as "King Pin" at Cal State Fullerton, where he earned 
all-conference honors for the tractor-sized holes he opened for 1978 NCAA 
rushing leader Obie Graves. 
</P>
<P>
 At 27, King was done with the football, but the drugs were just kicking in. 
King's cocaine habit followed him through four years as an assembly-line worker 
at Hughes Aircraft, through post-layoff unemployment, leading to his arrest and 
conviction for commercial burglary in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 King says he supported his $700-$800-a-week habit by selling stolen 
televisions and computers. "I had a friend who was a dispatcher for a freight 
company," King says. "He'd tell me when a truck was coming in and what 
different items were on it. I lifted what I wanted and sold them on my own." 
</P>
<P>
 It was then that King found a way to break his addiction. 
</P>
<P>
 Fifteen months in Soledad State Prison will do that for a man, King says. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been clean for 19 months now," King says. "The longest I've ever gone 
without a drink, a cigarette, smoking pot, whatever, since I was in college." 
</P>
<P>
 King was released from prison in December, but his life remains just as 
regimented. Up at 5:30 every morning. Pray from 6 to 7. Eat breakfast from 7 to 
7:30. Tend to chores after that. 
</P>
<P>
 King now serves as a work counselor for Home Free Ministries in Placentia, a 
recovery program for ex-drug offenders, ex-convicts and homeless men and women 
run by Pastor Vicente Esquivel of the Placentia Free Methodist Church. 
</P>
<P>
 Esquivel operates three recovery homes that currently house 37 men and nine 
women who, as King words it, "are not looking for a handout, but a hand up. We 
feed them, clothe them, give them a structured environment, help them get back 
on their feet." 
</P>
<P>
 The homes are supported solely by donations, Esquivel says -- whatever can be 
raised by weekly car washes and the one-day work programs King helps organize 
with Home Free members. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call them 'Soldiers,' " King says. "We go out in twos, sometimes in groups 
of four or six, and do whatever day jobs we can find. Like (Thursday), we did 
some work helping an electrician and helped another guy move in Irvine. We 
don't set a fee, we just do the work and take donations." 
</P>
<P>
 Life at Home Free is a Spartan existence, because the modest donations get 
spread fairly thin. "The Saturday car washes pay for the lights," King says. 
"And we eat beans and rice every day. A lot of beans and rice. Whenever we get 
a little meat in there, we're real happy." 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, King calls Home Free one of the best experiences of his life. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's been a real blessing," he says. "Who knows? Maybe without it, 
I'd be back on the street, back to that same old cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 And he knows where that cycle leads. King talks about one former Fullerton 
teammate who was shot to death in a drug deal a few years ago. He sees others, 
"Guys I played ball with, digging in trash cans now. Guys who got their 
degrees. You can see them now behind the Alpha Beta in Fullerton, digging 
through the trash." 
</P>
<P>
 King looks forward to the day when he can move back to his real home and 
repair his marriage. King and his wife, Benita, are separated, but Esquivel 
currently is counseling the couple. "She wants to make sure he's changed before 
they get back together," Esquivel says. "Leonard's doing good. Maybe another 
six months and then he goes home." 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, King gets out for a few hours every day, seeing that the work 
gets done, the word is spread and money is raised. (Donations and day jobs can 
be arranged by calling Home Free at (714) 579-7647 or (714) 632-3571.) 
</P>
<P>
 "The homes have a success rate of 75 to 80%," King says. "Of those who stick 
with the program, 75 to 80% go back to their families, get jobs and never 
relapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, that's one cut King believes he can make.

SALMON GOES TO HEAD OF CLASS; BASEBALL: HIS FOUR-YEAR, $7.5-MILLION CONTRACT 
WITH THE ANGELS IS THE RICHEST FOR A SECOND-YEAR PLAYER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB NIGHTENGALE, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Angel right fielder Tim Salmon prefers Jeeps to Mercedes. He'll take fast-food 
over candlelight cuisine. He wears jeans instead of Armanis. 
</P>
<P>
 But when a guy signs a four-year contract for $7.5 million, making him the 
richest second-year player in baseball history, you would think there would be 
some extra spending. 
</P>
<P>
 So just how did he plan to celebrate Thursday's historic signing? 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we're having leftovers," Salmon said. "Got a game tomorrow, you 
know." 
</P>
<P>
 Salmon, who immediately becomes one of the most unpretentious millionaires in 
the world, will be paid $600,000 in 1994, $900,000 in 1995, $2.5 million in 
1996 and $3.5 million in 1997. The contract also includes All-Star and MVP 
award bonus clauses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just winning the rookie of the year took the whole winter for that to sink 
in," Salmon said, "so this could take a while. Things have happened pretty fast 
since I got to the big leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never dreamed I'd be in this situation so soon." 
</P>
<P>
 In an unprecedented day that might forever change the Angels' penny-pinching 
image, Salmon was one of three players who received multiyear contracts. Center 
fielder Chad Curtis signed a three-year, $4.5-million contract and shortstop 
Gary DiSarcina received a three-year, $2.9-million contract. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know about past history, but this is the way the current 
administration wants to approach it," Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said. 
"We're very confident about their ability on the field, but you can't protect 
against everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Agent Ted Updike, who completed Salmon's contract after six hours of 
negotiations: "This is a change of philosophy, if you will. Mrs. (Jackie) Autry 
said she was doing something different than they had ever done with the young 
players. Hopefully, she said, it will set the tone of success that will follow 
on the field." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, trying to retain their nucleus without facing the perils of 
arbitration, have 10 players on their 40-man roster under multiyear contracts 
-- including five who are 26 years or younger. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a new era of open relations," DiSarcina said. "The cold war 
is over."

RAMS MAKE A DEAL WITH JIMMIE JONES; PRO FOOTBALL: FORMER COWBOY TACKLE SIGNS 
FOR $7.7 MILLION. QUARTERBACK IS NEXT PRIORITY, WITH MILLER HEADING LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams signed former Dallas Cowboy defensive tackle Jimmie Jones on Thursday 
night to a four-year contract for $7.7 million. Next in view: Atlanta 
quarterback Chris Miller, or possibly Green Bay's Brett Favre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams pursued Jones, who earned $385,000 in 1993, after hearing rumors that 
defensive end Robert Young might receive an offer sheet from the Pittsburgh 
Steelers. Jones, who will receive a $2-million signing bonus, spent Thursday in 
Chicago visiting with the Bears, but left in a hurry to travel to Anaheim after 
fielding the Rams' contract offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has signed and has already left L.A.," said agent Drew Rosenhaus. "He's 
the first Cowboy to leave. It's nice to win, but it's more important to pay the 
bills." 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great start," Coach Chuck Knox said of the 6-foot-4, 276-pound 
Jones, who scored a touchdown and made a couple of big plays in last year's 
Super Bowl victory over Buffalo. "This is a guy that we identified from the 
beginning who could help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones started only two games last season and had 5 1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, meanwhile, worked out for the Rams Thursday, and team physicians said 
his twice-injured knee is well on the mend and presents no significant risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who soured on Miami's Scott Mitchell after an early-week visit, were 
so impressed with Miller that they had Jay Zygmunt, senior vice president, fly 
to Stockton Thursday night to open negotiations with his agent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few days, the Rams talked about extending a $20-million, five-year 
offer sheet to Favre, who is a restricted free agent. His agent, Bus Cook, said 
Favre will be in Anaheim next week for a workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect very, very strongly that we will get an offer from the Rams," Cook 
told the Green Bay Press-Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams talked with Cook recently, but were left with the impression that 
Favre was not interested in talking about a move. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also disagreement among Ram coaches about Favre's overall 
effectiveness, and the team appeared to back away from Favre late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams extended an offer sheet to Favre and Green Bay chose not to match 
it, the Rams would have to surrender a first- and third-round pick in this 
year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
 They will have to give up nothing to sign Miller, and will have to offer him 
about $2.5 million to play here in contrast to the $4 million a year it would 
take to land Favre. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not written an offer sheet on any restricted player," said John Shaw, 
Ram executive vice president. "We're exploring the situation with a quarterback 
that would cost us a first- and third-round pick. But we're just talking." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams hope to wait a few days and look at Phoenix's Chris Chandler and 
Philadelphia's Bubby Brister next week before committing to Miller. There is 
still interest in Indianapolis quarterback Jeff George and Houston's Warren 
Moon, but the Rams are concerned that both might not become available via trade 
until the NFL draft late in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who was considered one of the game's best young quarterbacks before 
injuring a knee against the Rams in 1992, underwent a second knee operation a 
little less than five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to play for the Rams; I grew up a Rams fan," Miller said. "I was 
born in Pomona and lived in Claremont. My dad took me to see Roman Gabriel play 
when the Rams were just the blue and white. It would be a thrill to play for 
them."

A DECADE LATER, U.S. IS NO LONGER IN THE RACE; RUNNING: AMERICAN MARATHONERS 
HAVE FALLEN ON HARD TIMES SINCE THE DAYS OF FRANK SHORTER, BILL RODGERS AND 
ALBERTO SALAZAR.

 Frank Shorter was there when it began, so perhaps it was fitting that he was 
there when it ended. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 1984. A late August day in the Coliseum. The finish of both the Olympic 
Marathon and an era. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter was in street clothes, in the infield, watching and hoping for an 
American to carry the flame he had lit a decade earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 And what a fire that had been. Shorter's victory in the 1972 Olympic Marathon 
did for marathoning what Madonna did for blondes. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter, Bill Rodgers and Alberto Salazar -- all lonely long-distance runners 
who suddenly became household names. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter, Rodgers and Salazar -- Americans who dominated marathon running not 
just in this country, but the world. 
</P>
<P>
 It seemed as if it would go on forever. Then, on that late August day in 1984, 
Shorter looked up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the runners coming in and I realized, there were no Americans there," 
he recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Shorter stopped looking for names and instead focused on countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Portugal, Ireland, Great Britain, Japan, Australia, Tanzania, Kenya, Djibouti, 
Ireland, New Zealand. 
</P>
<P>
 When Peter Pfitzinger was the first American finisher in 11th place, Shorter 
knew something was terribly wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 When Salazar finished 26 seconds later in 15th place, he knew the fire had 
been extinguished. 
</P>
<P>
 "Alberto was getting older, and there was not much coming up behind him, and I 
thought, 'You know, things might be getting a little bleak,' " Shorter said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ten years later, even Shorter cannot believe how bleak.

<P>
 "It's like we've fallen off the face of the earth," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Spectators at the finish line of the ninth annual Los Angeles Marathon Sunday 
will probably agree. 
</P>
<P>
 An American has not won the marathon since Ric Sayre was the inaugural 
champion in 1986, when the race was still a novelty with 10,787 runners 
competing. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly twice as many are expected Sunday when, once again, the first runner to 
speak at the post-race news conference will probably require an interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 America's best male hope, Ed Eyestone, is rated sixth in the field. But among 
Americans, that is exceptional. Consider: 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1982, Salazar won the New York City Marathon and recorded the world's 
fastest time of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, no American male has won in New York City or finished a year with 
the world's fastest time. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1983, Americans took the top three spots in the Boston Marathon. No 
American has won the race since. 
</P>
<P>
 -- In 1983, 11 of the 50 fastest world marathon times were achieved by 
Americans. There have not been 11 top-50 times in the world from Americans in 
the last six years combined , according to Ryan Lamppa of the Road Running 
Information Center. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Americans recorded a first-, a second- and two fourth-place finishes in 
Olympic Marathons during the 1970s. No Americans have reached the top 10 in the 
Olympics since then. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm about to say will sound isolationist at best and racist at worst," 
wrote Joe Henderson, a Eugene, Ore.-based racing expert, in his Running 
Commentary newsletter. "When lead runners all have names we can't remember, and 
when they don't speak the language of the host country, the race suffers." 
</P>
<P>
 While American women haven't done much lately, still fresh are the exploits of 
Joan Benoit Samuelson. The American men are far more desperate in their search 
for a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 Here are three ideas why: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Long-distance running is the most competitive sport in the world. Athletes 
from the poorest countries can compete with the richest. 
</P>
<P>
 All you need is a pair of shoes. As some runners have proved, you don't even 
need that. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't have to be tall, you don't have to have a swimming pool, you don't 
need snow," said Bob Wood, agent for several top distance runners worldwide. 
"Unlike in other sports, our guys are competing against everybody on earth." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Because the prize money at U.S. races is so great, runners from poor 
countries can train for just two races a year, both marathons. Money won in one 
race can support them for six months until the next race. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the cost of living is so much higher here, the average American runner 
might compete in 25 races throughout the year, most of them shorter road races, 
just to make a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're feeding every top long-distance runner in the world," Wood said. 
</P>
<P>
 -- There is no emphasis in this country on coaching long-distance runners, who 
require years of nurturing, unlike sprinters. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say that of the top five American runners this year, only Bob 
Kempainen, who finished second in the New York City Marathon, has any sort of 
coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't see people training and working together here like in other 
countries," said John Mansoor, assistant to the executive director for USA 
Track & Field. "Once a runner leaves college, it's like he gets kicked out onto 
the street." 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of moaning about foreign competitors who will not disappear, many 
officials think that renewed emphasis should be placed on such coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 They say that this country's top long-distance runners should put aside petty 
jealousies and join together in a concerted effort, much like those Kenyan 
runners who are seen jogging across a desert in that athletic shoe commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 Who could lead them? Well, there is one former Olympic champion and current 
sportswear manufacturer from Boulder, Colo., who still runs and who would coach 
for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 But, well . . .

JORDAN'S DEBUT IS NO HIT; BASEBALL: HE GOES 0 FOR 3 WITH TWO STRIKEOUTS AND 
DROPS A FLY BALL IN RIGHT FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Had this been the debut of any other minor league player, it would have passed 
unremembered. Most would try to forget it.  
</P>
<P>
 Michael Jordan went hitless in three at-bats against virtual minor league 
pitchers Thursday, striking out twice in the Chicago White Sox's intrasquad 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 He nearly got a hit his first time up when he lined a fastball to left-center 
field against the best pitcher he faced, right-hander James Baldwin, but was 
robbed by Warren Newson's diving catch. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, if the crowd of 1,736 at Ed Smith Stadium remembers anything about 
Jordan's performance, it won't be his near hit, it will be his near catch. 
Jordan dropped a fly ball to short right field that scored the go-ahead run.  
</P>
<P>
 "I knew everyone was looking at me, and I didn't want to make any mistakes," 
Jordan said. "I've made a lot of mistakes -- I've made a lot of turnovers in my 
game -- but every little one is crucial in this game.  
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to catch the first one because everybody is sitting there thinking 
once they hit it to me, how will I respond? And I knew that, and I just didn't 
respond like I wanted. I'm glad I got another one hit to me so I left with 
people knowing that I can at least catch the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan was upbeat afterward, taking comfort that he was able to see pitches 
better, even if they were speeding by him. He was thrown a mixture of fastballs 
and breaking balls by three pitchers, including a left-hander. He called it a 
crash course in adjusting to pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 "Next time I play, I will feel more comfortable knowing that I made at least 
one mistake, and struck out already, and next time it won't be quite as 
embarrassing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 White Sox Manager Gene Lamont said it's too early to tell about Jordan. "The 
ball he hit today was probably the hardest one we hit," Lamont said. "He's 
improved a great deal, he's worked hard at it and that's why our players have 
accepted him. We will just have to see." 
</P>
<P>
 The longer this tryout continues, the clearer it becomes to those close to 
Jordan that it isn't about baseball, but is his way of grieving for his father, 
James, who was killed last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Jordan awakens each morning at 5 and arrives at the clubhouse while it's still 
dark, nearly two hours before the other White Sox players. On the drive in, he 
said he often looks over at the empty passenger seat and feels the presence of 
his father.  
</P>
<P>
 He even speaks to him. He tells his father that it's the two of them who are 
pursuing a baseball career together.  
</P>
<P>
 "He never grieved, and for all the criticism he is getting for doing this, if 
this is the way he's dealing with losing his father, then what's wrong with 
that?" said Bob Greene, a columnist for the Chicago Tribune who wrote a book 
with Jordan titled, "Hangtime." "He is down here doing this with his dad. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a pretty solitary endeavor for him, but he is really making an effort 
to fit in. He feels pretty much like an outsider. When I was over there (at 
Jordan's rented home), he borrowed my media guide and was putting names to 
faces, so he could learn everybody's name faster." 
</P>
<P>
 If he doesn't make the White Sox roster by the end of spring training, Jordan 
said he would go to the minors for up to two years, but no longer.  
</P>
<P>
 "I must go out and continue to improve and hopefully I can prove my critics 
wrong, but I can't let them get into my head and put doubt in my head, because 
then, I might as well quit," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were some good things that I saw today and I feel good about my skills 
and my chances, but I have to move forward and not let the critics set me 
back."

RAMS MAKE A DEAL WITH JIMMIE JONES; PRO FOOTBALL: FORMER COWBOY TACKLE SIGNS 
FOR $7.7 MILLION. QUARTERBACK IS NEXT PRIORITY, WITH MILLER HEADING LIST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Rams signed Dallas defensive tackle Jimmie Jones Thursday night to a 
four-year contract for $7.7 million, including a $2-million signing bonus. Now 
they have turned their sights on Atlanta quarterback Chris Miller, and possibly 
Green Bay quarterback Brett Favre. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams aggressively pursued Jones, who earned $385,000 in 1993, after 
hearing rumors that restricted free-agent defensive end Robert Young might 
receive an offer sheet from Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones spent Thursday in Chicago visiting the Bears, but left in a hurry to 
travel to Anaheim after agreeing to the Rams' lucrative offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has signed," said Drew Rosenhaus, Jones' agent. "He's the first Cowboy to 
leave. It's nice to win, but more important to pay the bills. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had 21 or 22 teams call to express an interest in him, but when the 
money's out there, you have to take it and run." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones, a 6-4, 276-pound defensive tackle, recovered a fumble for a touchdown 
in Super Bowl XXVII. He started only two games last season, however, and had 5 
1/2 sacks. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams intend to start Jones inside next to Sean Gilbert. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a great start," Coach Chuck Knox said. "This is a guy that we 
identified from the beginning who could help us." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller worked out for the Rams Thursday and team physicians said his 
twice-injured knee is mending and presents no significant risk. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who soured on Miami's Scott Mitchell after an early-week visit, were 
so impressed with Miller that they had Jay Zygmunt, senior vice president, fly 
to Stockton Thursday night to open negotiations with his agent. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few days the Rams talked about extending a $20-million, five-year 
offer sheet to Favre, who is a restricted free agent. His agent, Bus Cook, said 
Favre will be in Anaheim next week for a workout. 
</P>
<P>
 "I suspect very, very strongly that we will get an offer from the Rams," Cook 
told the Green Bay Press-Gazette. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams talked with Cook recently, but were left with the impression that 
Favre was not interested in talking about a move. Miller's workout and the 
positive reports on his left knee further cooled the Rams' interest in Favre. 
</P>
<P>
 There is also disagreement among Ram coaches to Favre's overall effectiveness, 
and the team appeared to back away from Favre late Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams extended an offer sheet to Favre and Green Bay chose not to match 
it, the Rams would have to surrender a first- and third-round pick in this 
year's draft. 
</P>
<P>
 They will have to give up nothing to sign Miller, and probably will have to 
offer him $2.4-$2.5 million to play here in contrast to the $4 million a year 
it would take to land Favre. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have not written an offer sheet on any restricted player," Shaw said. 
"We're exploring the situation with a quarterback that would cost us a first- 
and third-round pick. But we're just talking." 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have visits with Phoenix's Chris Chandler and Philadelphia's Bubby 
Brister scheduled next week. The team would like to look at both players before 
fully committing to Miller, but Kansas City also has expressed an interest in 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller, who was considered one of the game's best young quarterbacks before 
injuring a knee against the Rams in 1992, underwent a second knee operation a 
little less than five months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd love to play for the Rams; I grew up a Rams fan," Miller said. "I was 
born in Pomona and lived in Claremont. My dad took me to see Roman Gabriel play 
when the Rams were just the blue and white. It would be a thrill to play for 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important to me to play on grass and play on the West Coast. I think I 
got a hell of a lot left to offer. My knee's terrific and my arm's fresh." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller is not ready to play football, but he has assured the Rams he will 
remain here during the off-season for rehabilitation if the two come to terms. 
The Rams believe he will be ready in time to fully participate in training 
camp. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams remain interested in Indianapolis quarterback Jeff George and 
Houston's Warren Moon, but are concerned that both might not become available 
via trade until the NFL draft late in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw talked with Houston team owner Bud Adams four or five times about a trade 
involving Moon, but discussions have gone nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "At this point I'm not even sure he's up to be traded," Shaw said. "We 
expressed an interest and the response was if they were interested in trading 
him they would get back to us. That's been several weeks and there has been no 
contact back. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think we will seek to solve this quarterback issue quickly within the next 
week and we will not wait for teams to . . . I think we're going to operate on 
our timetable." 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, who is considered the top unrestricted free agent available, did not 
fare well after undergoing a physical examination with the Rams. Mitchell 
injured his shoulder last season, and the Rams were not impressed with his 
rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams met with Giant tackle Doug Riesenberg Thursday and will visit with 
Kansas City linebacker Lonnie Marts today.

VINCENT PROPOSAL BLASTS BASEBALL HIERARCHY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Former baseball commissioner Fay Vincent assails several owners and a former 
league president in a proposal for a book he plans to write. 
</P>
<P>
 Excepts from the proposal for "And the Horse They Rode In On: My Tumultuous 
Years as Baseball Commissioner," were published in today's editions of the New 
York Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent, who was forced to resign in 1992, makes the following comments, his 
strongest remarks on baseball's hierarchy: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bill White, the former National League president: a "good man" but 
"incompetent." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bud Selig, the acting commissioner and Milwaukee Brewer owner: a 
"small-town schlepper" who is the "emblem of baseball's decline." 
</P>
<P>
 -- New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner: "the most hated man in 
baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chicago White Sox owner Jerry Reinsdorf: "dangerous" and more to blame for 
the "poor state of baseball than anyone else." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Dodger owner Peter O'Malley: a "nitwit" and "bigot." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Cincinnati Red owner Marge Schott: the owner who "does the dumbest things." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Jackie Autry, the Angels' executive vice president and wife of owner Gene 
Autry: "mean-spirited and not bright." 
</P>
<P>
 Vincent said he "wouldn't put much stock in the tone" of the proposal, 
contending it was not in keeping with his style. When informed the excerpts 
would be published in the newspaper, he told the Times he would no longer write 
the book. 
</P>
<P>
 The Times said the 40-page proposal is being shopped to publishing houses by 
the William Morris Agency. After publishing rights are auctioned, the book 
would be written by Vincent and David Kaplan of Newsweek.

NHL UNION FOUNDER EAGLESON INDICTED; PRO HOCKEY: GOVERNMENT SEEKS TO REGAIN AT 
LEAST $2 MILLION IN SCHEMES INVOLVING MISUSE OF MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LISA DILLMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 R. Alan Eagleson, who rose to power as the founder of the NHL Players Assn. 
and agent of such star players as Bobby Orr, was indicted Thursday by a federal 
grand jury on charges of racketeering, fraud, obstruction of justice and 
embezzlement. 
</P>
<P>
 It was alleged in the 32-count indictment that Eagleson engaged in various 
criminal schemes by using his former position as executive director of the 
players' association and as a player agent for the purpose of acquiring 
personal wealth and profits. 
</P>
<P>
 The government wants Eagleson to turn over $2 million in cash and assets, 
money that would eventually be funneled back into the players' union. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was a misuse of trust that can't always be measured in dollars," U.S. 
Attorney Donald K. Stern said at a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Eagleson's lawyer, Jeremiah T. O'Sullivan issued a statement questioning 
whether the U.S. government had jurisdiction in the case since Eagleson is a 
Canadian citizen and the NHLPA is a Canadian labor organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "A quick review of the indictment reveals that it is remarkably vague . . . 
and contains nothing more than a rehashing of stories which have been 
circulated in the press for a number of years," said O'Sullivan, a former 
federal prosecutor. 
</P>
<P>
 Stern said that at times material to this indictment, a substantial majority 
of NHL teams were located in the United States. When Eagleson resigned in 
December 1991 as executive director of the NHLPA, there were 22 teams in the 
league and 15 were located in U.S. cities. 
</P>
<P>
 NHL Commissioner Gary Bettman said in a statement: "Throughout the grand 
jury's investigation the NHL and its clubs have cooperated fully with 
representatives of the FBI and the United States Attorney's Office. We will 
continue to do so. We are pleased that the grand jury's investigation 
apparently disclosed no misconduct by any NHL (official) or NHL club official. 
Since the charges against Mr. Eagleson are now before the courts, we will have 
no further comment." 
</P>
<P>
 A handful of NHL players were interviewed by authorities about Eagleson, 
including the Kings' Wayne Gretzky. Gretzky said he was interviewed "for about 
five hours" by the FBI last year. 
</P>
<P>
 It is expected that Eagleson, 61, could be arraigned within a couple of weeks. 
The trial probably would not start until this fall, Stern said. The charges 
carry different penalties. For instance, the count of racketeering could bring 
a maximum 20-year prison term and a maximum fine of $250,000. Each count of 
embezzlement of labor organization assets has the maximum of a five-year term 
and a $250,000 fine.  
</P>
<P>
 The FBI phase of the investigation into Eagleson focused on allegations that 
he defrauded the union and misappropriated funds from hockey tournaments, 
including the Canada Cup. A 1991 investigation by Russ Conway of the 
Eagle-Tribune of Lawrence, Mass., reported that of the $24 million the Canada 
Cup raised in revenues, 75 cents of each dollar went for expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 The indictment also included allegations that Eagleson: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Embezzled substantial NHLPA funds by claiming reimbursement for personal 
charges and expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Wrongfully converted NHLPA assets by lending out millions of dollars in the 
form of private mortgages on very favorable terms to close personal and 
business associates. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Received kickbacks and other things of value totaling more than $100,000 
from insurance brokers and others, in connection with his purchases of 
disability insurance policies on behalf of the NHL and NHLPA. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Obstructed and attempted to obstruct justice after the initiation of the 
investigation by causing a witness to alter and destroy various documents and 
records. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Defrauded two former NHL players, Glen Sharpley and Bob Dailey, and 
embezzled at least $5,000 from each in connection with the processing of 
disability claims on behalf of each player. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Made repeated, materially false representations to the NHLPA membership to 
conceal his unlawful activities.

ANAHEIM TRIES AGAIN TO KEEP RAMS IN TOWN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT and T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In an effort to prevent the Rams from being kicked out of their practice 
facility -- and possibly leave town entirely -- Anaheim city officials Thursday 
presented the team with a new lease for Rams Park, their home since 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they hoped the team would accept the offer before a March 
11 deadline imposed by the Magnolia School District, which issued the eviction 
ultimatum because it is frustrated by the lengthy negotiations for the practice 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Ram executive vice president, said he had not seen city's new offer 
and does not expect to have a decision until late next week. Shaw said team 
officials have no contingency plans for a practice facility if they leave Rams 
Park. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't really looked at it," he said. "I'm sure there are alternative 
sites. We're not restricted to practicing in Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over the practice facility has heightened concerns throughout the 
city that the Rams will move from Anaheim after next season. Team officials 
already have indicated they are exploring deals with other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Atty. Jack L. White said the Rams may be evicted if they don't 
decide on the lease by early next week. White said he has not heard from Shaw 
about the new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he has better things to do, like shopping his team across the country," 
White said. MATT LAIT and T.J. SIMERS

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; DISARCINA, CURTIS SIGN FOR SECURITY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Shortstop Gary DiSarcina needed only to look at his scarred right thumb. 
Center fielder Chad Curtis needed only to look at the projected numbers drawn 
up by his financial adviser. 
</P>
<P>
 That was enough for each to sign guaranteed three-year contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis, who looked Thursday as if he still wasn't sure he made the right 
decision, will earn $4.5 million over the next three years: $600,000 in 1994, 
$1.9 million in 1995 and $2 million in 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina, who was pleased but hardly ecstatic, received about $2.9 million, 
but did not want to divulge the details. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came into the negotiations asking for quite a bit more," Curtis said, "but 
my financial adviser showed me what $4.5 (million) can do for me the rest of my 
life. That was startling to me. 
</P>
<P>
 "Besides, how can I go back to Michigan during the off-season and complain 
that in the year 1996 I'm only going to make $2 million? 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to walk out of here jumping up and down. This is a good deal 
for the Angels. I want to come back in two years and say, 'I should have made 
more.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Angel General Manager Bill Bavasi said: "That's the way Chad works. He plays 
hard. He works hard. So he should negotiate hard. But I think all of the 
players have a reason to celebrate because they got good deals." 
</P>
<P>
 DiSarcina figured that he might also be short-changing himself until he 
stopped to consider the fragility of life. He broke his right thumb last Aug. 
26 when he was hit by a pitch thrown by Baltimore's Ben McDonald and missed the 
remainder of the season. He spent the off-season being fitted for five 
different casts, wondering if he would be able to return. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time I look at my thumb, and see that zipper on it, I think about how 
it could have hit my head," DiSarcina said. It's the first time I ever got 
seriously hurt and it scared me." BOB NIGHTENGALE

GIRLS' BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES; FINALLY, A TITLE SHOT FOR MATER DEI'S 
OTHER TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON H. REID, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Leticia Oseguera dropped the basketball and gazed at the large scarlet and 
gray banners adorning the walls of the Mater Dei High gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Oseguera was exhausted after a practice for the Mater Dei girls' basketball 
team, but she could not bring herself to leave. She studied every aspect of the 
banners, which are testaments to the supremacy of Mater Dei boys' basketball. 
</P>
<P>
 She was filled with envy. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone always goes to the boys' games and gives them a lot of support," 
Oseguera said. "I go to some of the games too, and I'm real happy for them, but 
I thought about how different it is for us. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wondered if some people even know we have a girls' team. I just wished we 
could play for championships like they do." 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes wishes do come true. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Oseguera, their standout senior center, the Monarchs play for their 
first Southern Section title tonight. Mater Dei meets defending-champion 
Ventura Buena in the Division I-A final at Ventura College. Tip-off is 
scheduled for 7:30. 
</P>
<P>
 Oseguera no longer longs for fan support. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is so exciting," Oseguera said. "Before, only our family and friends 
came out to watch us, but now the stands are full at a lot of our games. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's fun to have people out there rooting for you . . . to have people in 
school who know your name. The boys have stuff like this happen to them all the 
time, but this is something really new to us." 
</P>
<P>
 Success in boys' basketball at Mater Dei is as common as the jump shot. The 
Monarchs have won nine section titles and two State titles in the past 11 
seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Mary Hauser said that if the Monarch girls are to raise their first 
championship banner, Oseguera must lead them. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are now saying, 'Wow, Mater Dei really does have a good girls' 
basketball team too,' " Hauser said, "and Leticia has been a big reason for 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "You couldn't ask anything else of a kid. She's been the leader I expected her 
to be and more." 
</P>
<P>
 The role is one to which Oseguera has grown accustomed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach told me before the season that she needed me to be a leader because we 
were going to have a lot of young players on the team," Oseguera said. "There 
is always room for improvement, but I think I've done a good job." 
</P>
<P>
 Facts are facts. 
</P>
<P>
 Oseguera leads the South Coast League-champion Monarchs (24-3) in scoring and 
rebounding with averages of 18.4 and 8.4, respectively. Last season, Oseguera 
averaged 16 points and led the county in rebounding (16.4). 
</P>
<P>
 Hauser said that Oseguera's decline in rebounding is not a negative. 
</P>
<P>
 "Leticia improved her shooting and we have other people who can rebound this 
season, so she doesn't have to do as much," Hauser said. "She really has worked 
very hard to improve her overall game." 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Coach Joe Vaughan is also an Oseguera admirer. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is a very good player," Vaughan said. "She has good moves in the post and 
she goes to the basket well." 
</P>
<P>
 Cerritos saw Oseguera's complete repertoire in the semifinals -- and was not 
pleased. 
</P>
<P>
 Oseguera was scoreless in the first half, spending much of it on the bench 
because of foul trouble. But she took control after the break, scoring 18 of 
Mater Dei's 25 second-half points in leading the team to a 65-62 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm so proud of what our team has done this season," Oseguera said. "We all 
worked together to pull off something that we've never done before. 
</P>
<P>
 "No matter what happens (against Buena), I'm going to take a lot of good 
memories from my senior year."

GIRLS' SOCCER CHAMPIONSHIPS; MARINA COACH SAYS THE VIKINGS ARE WELL PREPARED TO 
MEET PENINSULA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN BECK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Marina girls' soccer Coach Bobby Bruch has many reasons to be confident that 
his team is ready for its Southern Section Division I title game against Palos 
Verdes Peninsula tonight at Cerritos Gahr High School. 
</P>
<P>
 -- The Vikings have been here before, tying Claremont for the title last 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 -- They haven't shown signs of wilting under the pressure of their 38-game 
unbeaten string. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bruch is using mental-preparation techniques that helped his college coach, 
Cliff McCrath of Seattle Pacific, win NCAA Division II championships with Bruch 
in 1985 and 1986. 
</P>
<P>
 But perhaps the best reason is in the way the top-seeded Vikings (27-0-1) are 
playing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You want to get hot right now and I think we are," Bruch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marina is led by junior forward Cassie Campbell, the Sunset League offensive 
player of the year, who has 28 goals and 12 assists. But she isn't the only 
weapon. Sophomore Jenny Benson has 13 goals and 15 assists and Rhiannon Tanaka, 
a USC-bound senior, has seven goals and 12 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Third-seeded Peninsula (26-1-3) counters with UCLA-bound Traci Arkenberg, who 
has 56 goals and 14 assists this season. Arkenberg scored both goals in 
Peninsula's 2-0 semifinal victory over Capistrano Valley. Marina handed 
Peninsula its only loss of the season, 3-1, in December. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the Division II title game at 2 p.m. Saturday, unseeded Esperanza (18-5-4) 
plays top-seeded Torrance Bishop Montgomery (20-2-2). 
</P>
<P>
 The Aztecs have been plagued by injury since pre-season. Two players who were 
expected to start in the midfield -- senior Dawn Chastain and junior Kerry 
Murray -- suffered season-ending knee injuries playing in club games. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the injuries, Esperanza Coach Phyllis Scarborough had expected the 
Aztecs to challenge for a section title. 
</P>
<P>
 "After losing our midfield, I didn't give us a prayer," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But younger players filled in and the Aztecs were 6-0-1 in the Empire League 
until another injury wave resulted in a 0-2-1 finish. They wound up second in 
the league behind Los Alamitos. 
</P>
<P>
 Now the Aztecs seem to be strong again, by their standards. Sophomore forward 
Tina Brescini is recovering from the flu, which slowed her in the semifinals 
Tuesday. She has scored four goals in the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense, anchored by senior sweeper Joy Lindsay, and senior goalkeeper 
Suzanne Benet, has been strong throughout. 
</P>
<P>
 Bishop Montgomery has a 17-game unbeaten streak, which started when it got its 
full team together after the girls' volleyball playoffs and college entrance 
exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore forward Michelle Kallas has 23 goals and 11 assists and senior 
midfielder Rachel Moseley has 13 goals and nine assists.

GIRLS' BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES; NEWPORT HARBOR HAS EXPERIENCE IN WINNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two teams, two paths, same destination. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda has been to the Southern Section championship game before. The 
Ladycats are athletic and, more important, true basketball players. They do the 
little things that separate great teams from very good teams. Three consecutive 
State titles are testimony to that. 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor has no true basketball players. The Sailors reached their goal 
this season by advancing a game further than last year, when they lost in the 
semifinals. They have never been on a gymnasium floor the last day of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Not in basketball, anyway. 
</P>
<P>
 But when they step on the court at 11:15 a.m. Saturday to tip off against the 
nation's second-ranked team, they should be on even emotional terms with 
Brea-Olinda (28-0). See, the Sailors have played plenty of big games before -- 
but in different sports. 
</P>
<P>
 The focus it took for Gina Heads to sink the free throws in the final seconds 
of Newport Harbor's 43-41 semifinal victory over Newbury Park came not from 
having made big free throws before, but from stepping up to a barbell and 
performing a clean and jerk that lifted her into the nation's elite for her age 
group. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda players concentrate year-round on basketball. Newport Harbor 
(22-6) has players whose primary sport is usually something else. 
</P>
<P>
 Heads has the potential to become a world-class weightlifter and reached the 
State finals in the shotput and discus. Melissa Schutz and Tina Bowman were on 
the nationally ranked volleyball team. Genevieve Evarts has competed in 
international piano competitions and played tennis for the Southern Section 
runner-up. Mandy Clayton was a section qualifier in the triple and long jumps, 
and Bowman took third in the State high jump for the track team, which won the 
Division II title. 
</P>
<P>
 The full team came together Dec. 6, three weeks after most began practicing, 
because of the volleyball team's success. The Sailors split their first eight 
games, but won 15 of their last 17. The two losses were to Woodbridge, which is 
playing for the Division II-AA title. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been able to persevere with a group of gals who have less opportunity 
to practice together because they've been in pressure games, pressure track 
meets, pressure this and pressure that; they've learned how to deal with that," 
Coach Shannon Jakosky said. "Parents and athletes are missing the boat when 
they encourage or limit an athlete to specialize in one sport." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past calendar year, various Newport Harbor players have competed for 
Section titles in basketball, cross-country, track, swimming, tennis and 
volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
 None of Brea-Olinda's players has played for a title other than basketball. 
Two have played for three State basketball titles, and eight have played for 
three section titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Jakosky said her team's non-basketball experience should help. Brea-Olinda 
Coach John Hattrup agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have as much experience in those types of situations as we do, except 
theirs is in different sports and ours is in basketball," Hattrup said. "They 
don't have any All-American basketball players, but they have All-American 
volleyball players. 
</P>
<P>
 "What those kids bring from other sports is that they go to the show; they've 
performed and they've won. If people think we're looking past Newport, they're 
crazy." 
</P>
<P>
 Newport Harbor should be mentally ready for the challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, Brea is a great team, but that has nothing to do with us," Jakosky 
said. "Half the battle of playing a team of Brea's caliber is conquering the 
emotional battle before you step on the floor, of not conceding the victory 
before you play. I have confidence our athletes won't do that. We're not here 
to be sacrificial lambs; we're here to play to the best of our ability."

GIRLS' BASKETBALL CHAMPIONSHIP GAMES; A FRESHMAN WOODBRIDGE CAN COUNT ON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Woodbridge High's Erin Stovall is only a freshman, but she's not overwhelmed 
by it. 
</P>
<P>
 She already has shown a penchant for playing beyond her years and has 
established herself as one of the county's best young clutch girls' basketball 
players. 
</P>
<P>
 Desperate moments provide her cues: 
</P>
<P>
 * Stovall's 17-footer in the final seconds put away Marina, 51-47; she scored 
six of her 10 points in the fourth quarter as Woodbridge outscored the Vikings, 
18-14, to win its fourth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 * She scored five points in the final 2 1/2 minutes as Woodbridge outscored 
Kirkland (Wash.) Lake Washington, 13-4, in a 43-39 victory, its ninth in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 * She had a team-high 12 points, and made two free throws with no time 
remaining to send the game into overtime, in the Warriors' 49-44 quarterfinal 
victory over Oxnard Rio Mesa, their 27th consecutive triumph. 
</P>
<P>
 * She scored a team-high 15 points, and made six of seven from the line in the 
fourth quarter of a four-point game, as Woodbridge held off Ocean View, 49-38, 
in the section semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 See a trend? Those are the closest games the Warriors have had this season. 
They are 28-0, one of only three unbeaten teams in the Southern Section. 
Stovall doesn't appear to be a flash in the game plan, either. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had about five outstanding freshmen in my 11 years here," Woodbridge 
Coach Eric Bangs said, "and I think Erin has made the biggest impact out of all 
of them -- as a freshman. Melanie (Pearson) did a great job last year but 
worked her way into the starting lineup. Erin was there from Day 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge has looked forward to Saturday since Day 1. When Stovall, Pearson, 
et al take the floor against Hemet (21-5) at 2:45 p.m. in the Division II-AA 
championship game, they will be trying to win the program's second Southern 
Section title. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get psyched up for the bigger games," she said. "It makes you feel like you 
have to step your game up another notch to come out on top." 
</P>
<P>
 Hemet won't be a pushover. The Bulldogs have won 11 in a row. They thrive on 
the inside with 6-foot-2 center Angela Darnell and 6-2 forward Jennifer Felger, 
and the penetration skills of 5-11 point guard Michelle Marshall. They get the 
most out of their defense, holding teams in the low-40 range. Every point will 
be an important one for the Warriors, especially those that come off defense -- 
Bangs said Woodbridge has to create points off turnovers -- and Stovall does a 
nice job of getting out in the passing lanes and disrupting opposing offenses. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's shown an uncharacteristic quality of stepping up at crunch time in some 
tight games," Bangs said. "Obviously last week, in both games, she was able to 
step up and make the free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like she surveys things and then steps up. When we're bogged down, 
she has the ability to slither through and create a shot for herself and draw 
the foul. She's shot almost twice as many free throws as anyone on the team." 
</P>
<P>
 The freshman has made 87 of 131 (66.4%). In the last two playoff victories, 
she is 19 of 23 (82.3%). And her big night at the line against Rio Mesa, when 
she buried the do-or-die free throws to send the game to overtime, came after a 
one-of-six shooting performance from the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I didn't want to be there because it was the deciding factor, but 
after I made them, I was glad I was at the free-throw line," Stovall said. "The 
key is to stay focused and keep your poise." 
</P>
<P>
 Two skills she learned at an early age.

CIF STATE WRESTLING CHAMPIONSHIPS; CALVARY CHAPEL FAVORED TO REPEAT PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 They are soft-spoken, humble and self-deprecating. Off the mat . 
</P>
<P>
 On the mat, once that two-minute whistle blows, Calvary Chapel's State-bound 
wrestling team is none of the above. 
</P>
<P>
 Today the Eagles begin their second State title bid when the two-day 
tournament commences this morning at Pacific's Spanos Center in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 The Division III Southern Section and defending State champion Calvary Chapel 
heads an impressive 31-strong Orange County contingent, 11 of whom are among 
the top four seeded wrestlers in their divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, when the small Santa Ana school won its first title, the Eagles did 
it with six wrestlers. This year they send eight, twice as many as Shingle 
Springs Ponderosa, the team the Eagles defeated for the 1993 title, 79-72. 
</P>
<P>
 Several county coaches have said Calvary Chapel needs only to show up to win 
its second consecutive title. The Eagles aren't making guarantees but know 
they're heavily favored to repeat last season's run. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every week, the level of interest goes up," said Dane Valdez, the top-seeded 
wrestler at 125 pounds and the defending State champion at 119. "We know we're 
capable of doing well. We're definitely peaking for (State)." 
</P>
<P>
 Eagles expected to finish well this weekend include Valdez and brother Shane 
(119), who was a State runner-up at 112 last year; Masters champions Josh 
Holiday (145) and Ed Mosley (152), who are seeded third and first; section and 
Masters runner-up and second-seeded Joe Calavitta (103), and section champion 
Mauricio Mora (135). 
</P>
<P>
 Division I section dual and team champion El Modena has the athletes to 
improve on its 12th-place finish in 1993. The Vanguards are represented by 
section champion and 1993 State runner-up Teak Sato (130), who transferred from 
Savanna in February, Masters champion Juan Alvarez (135), runner-up David Wells 
(140) and Chris Jaime (145). 
</P>
<P>
 Teams that could press Calvary Chapel are Ponderosa, and six-time State 
champion Clovis which qualified five wrestlers. San Diego power Poway sent 
three representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena Park qualified top-seeded Vince Virgen, who dropped to 130 pounds for 
the postseason and upset Sato at the Masters meet, and heavyweight Wali Sibrie, 
a runner-up here last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana is represented by Ronald Hernandez (130), Roger Santiago (103) and 
Miguel Valencia (125). Capistrano Valley sent section and Masters champion 
Terry Tuzzolino (171) and Alec Laidlaw (160). 
</P>
<P>
 The Orange County representatives: 
</P>
<P>
 103 -- Joe Calavitta (Calvary Chapel), Roger Santiago (Santa Ana); 119 -- Tim 
Lee (Woodbridge), Shane Valdez (Calvary Chapel); 125 -- Jonte Davis (Edison), 
Justin Meier (Irvine), Dane Valdez (Calvary Chapel), Miguel Valencia (Santa 
Ana); 130 -- Ronald Hernandez (Santa Ana), Tom Noel (El Dorado), Teak Sato (El 
Modena), Vince Virgen (Buena Park) 
</P>

 135 -- Juan Alvarez (El Modena), Mauricio Mora (Calvary Chapel); 140 -- Darryl 
Christian (Canyon), Alfred Frausto (Edison), Danny Robinson (Calvary Chapel), 
David Wells (El Modena); 145 -- Josh Holiday (Calvary Chapel), Chris Jaime (El 
Modena); 152 -- Ed Mosley (Calvary Chapel), John Witting (San Clemente) 
</P>
<P>

Tuzzolino (Capistrano Valley), Matt Van Hook (Calvary Chapel); 189 -- Jessy Liu 
(Woodbridge); Hwt -- Jim Ambriz (Saddleback), Wali Sibrie (Buena Park), Mark 
Zolikoff (Laguna Hills).

HOOKED IN OJAI; GTE MOVE TO NOT SPONSOR GOLF TOURNEY FAILS TO DETER PLAYERS, 
FANS 
</P>

 Anne Truhan of Camarillo Springs waited anxiously by the 15th green, clutching 
a pen and Thursday's program, ready to pounce on a living legend as soon as he 
finished putting. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't need a pen," tournament volunteer John Behne said from behind her. 
"Arnie's got one in his back pocket that he uses." 
</P>
<P>
 Moments later, clad in hand-pressed slacks and a bright purple golf shirt with 
a car company logo, Arnold Palmer knocked down a six-foot putt for par and 
headed straight for Truhan. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hundreds?" the professional golfer said, referring to the number of 
autographs he had signed. "That was in the first hour." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousands of people crowded the footpaths along 18 holes at the Ojai Valley 
Inn as the GTE West Classic golf tournament held its pro-am contest Thursday, 
the final round before the 54-hole Senior PGA event officially begins today. 
</P>
<P>
 Although GTE said Monday that it would no longer sponsor the tournament after 
the final round Sunday, the announcement did nothing to dampen the spirits of 
players or fans. The communications giant said it would be focusing its 
resources on new technology and downsizing its sports marketing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's hope it's coming back," said Palmer, perspiration dripping from his 
tanned forehead as he made his way to the 16th tee. "There are rumors to the 
effect that it may stay." 
</P>
<P>
 Like others bantering about the possibility of the Ojai Valley Inn attracting 
another sponsor and retaining the tournament, however, Palmer declined to 
speculate about its future. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this is a great place for an event like this," he said. "It would be 
a shame not to have a tournament here of the senior caliber." 
</P>
<P>
 Officially, the Senior PGA and Ojai Valley Inn are seeking a new corporate 
sponsor to replace GTE, but have not yet found one. GTE has sponsored the 
tournament since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 It costs between $1 million and $2 million to sponsor the event, according to 
Senior PGA estimates. GTE declined to say what it spent promoting the 
tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 Although dozens of other top-ranking senior golf pros will participate in the 
tournament over the weekend, Palmer is the most popular by far. Hundreds of 
fans -- known collectively as Arnie's Army -- followed him Thursday from hole 
to hole, cheering his triumphs and bemoaning his misses. 
</P>
<P>
 "The man is golf," Ventura chiropractor Ken Plaut said, just outside the 14th 
green. "No one would be here if it weren't for him. He made this tournament 
what it is. I've been following him all morning." 
</P>
<P>
 The $550,000 tournament will generate tens of thousands of dollars for local 
charities and even more for local businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the CREW, Interface and the Ojai Education Foundation will receive 
proceeds from the event. Nordhoff High School will get the revenues from the $5 
parking fees. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotels and motels have been booked solid for weeks, and downtown Ojai's 
restaurants and specialty shops are also brimming with out-of-towners. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the players' wives love it here," said Andrea Bloom, who owns Tottenham 
Court Ltd. in the Ojai Arcade. "Those wives shop in the best places in the 
world, so when they like our things, we consider that a compliment." 
</P>
<P>
 Tottenham Court was not the only shop with an increase in foot traffic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any time there is a tournament or a festival, business improves," said 
Virginia Layfield of Helga & Hellmut, a wearable art boutique just east of 
Bloom's store. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of people who hadn't been here come back," Layfield said. "We have 
women who shop here annually." 
</P>
<P>
 Not every business, however, is raking in tourist dollars as a result of the 
GTE West Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mass people, but not a lot of buyers," said Natasha Cordes, whose family owns 
the Cordes Four clothing and accessory shop. "I'm hoping the rest of this week 
and the weekend will be really busy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even without huge sales increases due to the tournament, merchants say losing 
West Classic would be a shame. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't bring us a horde of people, but it's fun," said Eric Zacher, 
manager of Rains, an Arcade fixture since 1916. "I'd really hate to see it go. 
It's part of the ambience of Ojai -- and not just from the business 
standpoint." 
</P>
<P>
 Several miles from the bustling downtown, where the 15th green meets the 16th 
tee at the Ojai Valley Inn, Truhan proudly grasped her Thursday program bearing 
a fresh ball-point autograph from Palmer. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so gracious," she said, still flustered from the encounter. "He smiled 
when I asked to take his picture. I was really thrilled." FYI 
</P>
<P>
 The GTE West Classic golf tournament begins today at the Ojai Valley Inn. 
Tickets for the first and second rounds cost $12 each and can be purchased at 
Ticketmaster locations or by calling 646-5796. Final round tickets for Sunday 
cost $15. Parking is $5.

SHERIFF'S DEPT. SUSPENDS PILOT AFTER COPTER FIRE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County Sheriff's Department has suspended and is considering 
firing a veteran pilot who was flying a $1.1-million helicopter when it was 
destroyed by fire last summer, according to the pilot and law enforcement 
sources. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Spangenberg, a Vietnam War combat pilot who for 14 years has flown 
rescue missions for the Sheriff's Department, said he was placed on paid leave 
Dec. 2 and was told the department intended to fire him. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department officials would neither confirm that they are considering 
firing Spangenberg nor would they comment on his assertion that the suspension 
was related to the loss of the department's newest and best-equipped 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter fire occurred as the aircraft was helping to start a controlled 
burn of brush in a canyon east of Thousand Oaks. At the time, sheriff's 
officials commended Spangenberg for making a heroic effort to save the 
helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Spangenberg, 49, declined to discuss details of the case, except to say he is 
fighting to keep his job. The pilot's Santa Monica attorney is trying to 
negotiate a settlement with the department that would allow Spangenberg to stay 
with the department and possibly to continue flying. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to fly the helicopter," said Spangenberg, who lives in Camarillo. "I 
want to continue doing the work that I think I do so well." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board into the 
accident's cause has not been released. But Scott Erickson, the lead 
investigator, said a device that dropped small incendiary devices from the air 
was the source of the fire's ignition. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal investigators found no evidence that the device malfunctioned, he 
said. Erickson declined to comment further on the cause of the fire. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bell 206 L-3 was destroyed June 30 during a controlled 500-acre brush fire 
in Cheeseboro Canyon east of Thousand Oaks. The helicopter had been helping to 
set the fire by dropping incendiary devices the size of golf balls throughout 
the morning. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10:30 a.m., the five-seat helicopter landed on a hill about half a mile 
from the burn area and the engine was in idle, Spangenberg told federal 
investigators. It was then that crew members noticed flames on the ground 
beside the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Crew chief Jeff Lawrence, 42, ran clear of the flames while Spangenberg tried 
unsuccessfully to lift off as flames engulfed the helicopter. 
</P>
<P>
 Spangenberg suffered first-, second- and third-degree burns on his face, arm 
and leg as he ran from the flames. He has undergone one set of skin grafts and 
may undergo another. 
</P>
<P>
 The helicopter has been replaced by a model costing about half as much. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's officials would not comment on the findings of their administrative 
investigation into the accident. But Lt. Mark Ball, who supervises the 
personnel department, said Spangenberg's job status does not hinge on the 
findings of the NTSB investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to Spangenberg's suspension, Lawrence has been reassigned from the 
Sheriff's Aviation Unit, a job that was considered a part-time duty, to the 
County Jail, according to an official with the unit. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Based at the Camarillo Airport, the unit assists in fighting brush fires, 
rescuing injured hikers and ferreting out marijuana crops in remote canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Spangenberg began his flying career in 1964 when he joined the Army and 
attended flight school. He flew combat missions in Vietnam in 1965 and 1966 and 
was discharged in 1968. 
</P>
<P>
 He joined the Sheriff's Aviation Unit in 1979 after attending the training 
academy and becoming a sworn deputy. In 1992, a national pilots association 
gave Spangenberg its highest award for rescues he made during severe floods in 
the county.

POLICE CONDUCT DOOR-TO-DOOR MANHUNT FOR ARMED ROBBERS; OXNARD: AS UNNERVED 
RESIDENTS WATCH, AN AREA OF 20 HOMES IN LA COLONIA IS SEALED OFF. BUT SUSPECTS 
IN JEWELRY HEIST ESCAPE. 
</P>

 Armed with automatic weapons, Oxnard police sealed off an area of 20 homes in 
the La Colonia neighborhood Thursday morning in a door-to-door search for two 
armed robbers who held up a jewelry store and were seen running into the 
residential area. 
</P>
<P>
 The manhunt -- watched by frightened residents for 90 minutes -- began after 
two suspects, one carrying a machine gun and the other a semiautomatic handgun, 
robbed Roberto Moita at his jewelry store at 537 S. A St. shortly after 10 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said they took a reported $10,000 worth of jewels before running across 
the 3rd Street bridge on Oxnard Boulevard and into La Colonia. 
</P>
<P>
 Approximately 15 police officers -- SWAT team members, a K-9 unit, detectives 
and even bike-patrol officers -- cordoned off a block-long area between 2nd and 
3rd streets and Roosevelt and McKinley avenues, where they believed the men 
were hiding, Sgt. Cliff Troy said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents peered out the windows of their small pink and yellow houses, while 
several others stood on the sidewalk watching the home searches. After 90 
minutes, however, officers determined that the suspects had escaped. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police knocked on my door and said they were searching for somebody," 
said Manuel Serros, 48, who lives on the corner of 2nd Street and Roosevelt 
Avenue. Serros said he offered to let officers search his home, but they 
declined. 
</P>
<P>
 "The police come over here, I welcome them," Serros said, adding that crime in 
his neighborhood is out of hand. "It's just a cesspool here." 
</P>
<P>
 Graciela Cortes, 40, who lives on McKinley Avenue, said she was frightened by 
the armed officers at the end of her street. 
</P>
<P>
 "We didn't see anything, just lots of cops around with their guns drawn," she 
said. "It's scary." 
</P>
<P>
 Moita said the robbery was the fourth at his jewelry store in the six years he 
has owned it. He was alone in his store when the two men walked in and asked 
for money and jewels, Moita said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say, 'If you don't put jewelry in the bag, we blow your head off,' " 
Moita said. The men, one wearing a stocking mask over his face, took $2,000 in 
cash and an estimated $8,000 in jewelry, including two diamond and ruby 
bracelets valued at $2,000 each, Moita said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the suspects left, Moita pressed a burglar alarm and officers from the 
Oxnard Police Department arrived about 15 minutes later, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents in the La Colonia neighborhood reported seeing the suspects, who 
were described as young Latino males, Troy said. One was wearing a mask and a 
white-and-black striped shirt and the other a black sweat shirt with a Raiders 
football insignia on the front, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Both of them were seen jumping a fence in a side yard at 2nd and Roosevelt," 
Troy said. Officers set up a perimeter in the area and started going through 
houses. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy said residents consented to the searches and none voiced any complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 An officer was injured during the search, bitten on the hand by a K-9 dog. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy said the dog "got excited" and bit Sgt. Randy Coates, coordinator of the 
K-9 unit, when he accidentally tripped. Coates was treated and released from 
St. John's Regional Medical Center for a minor cut, Troy said.

ON THE ISSUE: INFORMED OPINIONS ON TODAY'S TOPICS; WHEN IT ISN'T A MEDICAL 
EMERGENCY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID E. BRADY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Under a directive from Mayor Richard Riordan to cut costs and privatize some 
city services, the Board of Fire Commissioners gave preliminary approval 
Tuesday to use private ambulance companies to respond to non-emergency 911 
calls. The plan calls for private ambulances to be dispatched on about 17% of 
the department's 230,000 annual calls. Supporters point to a 1991 pilot program 
at a Canoga Park fire station as a successful example of privatization, arguing 
that the arrangement allows city rescue workers to respond to more serious 
calls. The plan now awaits the commission's final approval before the City 
Council and mayor consider it in April. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Should Los Angeles use private ambulance firms to handle non-emergency 911 
calls? 
</P>
<P>
 Donald Mauran, president of San Fernando-based Mauran Ambulance Service: 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to run calls for nothing. Somebody has to pay for us. Every 
time we run a call we have no guarantee the insurance is good. Only one in five 
has insurance. . . . If the person has no insurance, they go to the closest 
hospital to minimize the expense. We don't worry about your ability to pay. If 
we did, we'd never go out. . . . Yes, I think (the plan) would be successful. 
The Valley should not have to rely on the Fire Department for medical calls. 
That's why they're called the Fire Department." 
</P>
<P>
 Roger Gillis, Los Angeles City Fire Department battalion chief: 
</P>
<P>
 "The objective is to provide (the public) with quicker service, because there 
will be more resources available to handle emergency services. . . . With the 
resources we have, should we be going to some of these (non-emergency) calls? 
It lessens the chance we'll be ready for the call that does need us. . . . By 
the time (the program is) off and running, I don't think you're going to see a 
lot of dollar savings. The citizen gets a better service by allowing us to 
concentrate on emergency calls." 
</P>
<P>
 David W. Fleming, vice president of the five-member Board of Fire 
Commissioners: 
</P>
<P>
 "We lose people's lives because we get non-emergency calls and we can't 
respond. With limited resources, we have to concentrate on real emergencies and 
turn the non-emergencies over to private services. These are calls where the 
individual needing treatment could just as well take a cab. . . . We had a 
pilot program in the Valley and 90% of the people seemed happier (with the 
results). I think if you put it to a vote of the people, they'd overwhelmingly 
approve it. I don't know how many people have died in recent years because we 
couldn't get to them. We're not in the health care business, we're in the 
emergency services business." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Song Winner, fire commissioner who cast the board's sole vote against 
preliminary approval of the proposal: 
</P>
<P>
 "I voted against it because I don't have enough information to understand the 
impact on the public. I am looking for an analytical report on this recommended 
change. What I'm looking for is, what are the nature of these (non-emergency) 
calls? . . . I've seen how in some fire stations, the (emergency medical 
technicians) are incredibly busy. They are constantly, constantly going out. I 
think they sometimes go out on calls where perhaps it wasn't necessary. 
Sometimes people (call who) have no way of getting to available health care. 
Maybe sometimes it's not necessary to respond."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; SCHOOL UP FOR 'DRUG-FREE' PROGRAM HONOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MAIA DAVIS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Saticoy School in Ventura is one of seven California schools chosen to compete 
for a national award for its efforts to teach students about the dangers of 
drug and alcohol abuse. 
</P>
<P>
 Nominated by the California Department of Education, Saticoy is among 150 
schools nationwide vying to win an honor for having the best "Drug-Free" 
program in the United States. The national winner will be announced May 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Most elementary schools around Ventura County teach students about the dangers 
of drug and alcohol abuse in health classes and through programs taught by 
local police officers. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Saticoy, teachers and counselors weave their lessons about substance 
abuse into many school activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Students in the first through third grades learn about the risks of alcohol 
use through puppet shows performed by teachers or older students. The shows' 
scripts are written by a national alcohol-education association. 
</P>
<P>
 And the school offers support groups for children in the third through fifth 
grades who have a parent, sibling or other family member with an alcohol or 
drug problem. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the more unusual programs at Saticoy aims to help children who are 
particularly shy or quiet become bolder and more self-confident. 
</P>
<P>
 The idea, school counselor Dixie Rose said, is that young children who feel 
cut off from classroom or extracurricular activities may be at risk later in 
life of retreating into drug use or excessive drinking. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any child that has a different orientation to their school or to themselves 
or to their community is usually considered 'at risk,' " Rose said. 
</P>
<P>
 Funded by a federal grant, the program gives individual children one 30-minute 
session per week with an adult trained by the county's Mental Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 In a specially designated playroom at the school, the adult follows the 
child's suggestions for what the two should play or talk about. 
</P>
<P>
 "The person will follow the child's lead, whether it's in conversation, 
whether it's playing," Rose said. "It's trying to empower the child." 
</P>
<P>
 One measure of the program's success is that it has a waiting list, Principal 
Nancy Bradford said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Saticoy launched programs six years ago to educate students about drug 
and alcohol abuse, school officials had to convince some parents to allow their 
children to participate. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, she said, many parents ask school officials to help their child cope with 
various problems, such as having a family member who is alcoholic or addicted 
to drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 "They come to us," Bradford said. "Parents trust us to help their children."

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA PAULA; MAN GETS 8 YEARS IN GRAND THEFT, FRAUD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DWAYNE BRAY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge on Thursday sentenced a former Santa Paula man to eight years in 
prison in a fraud case that left a trail of victims in Ventura County and 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 A jury in December convicted 38-year-old Liam Russell of 36 criminal charges, 
including 28 counts of grand theft. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors had argued that Russell is a professional con artist who cheated 
several people out of their life's savings. One such case involved Ron's RV 
Sales of Santa Paula, which Russell attempted to buy. Russell gave partial 
payment to the owners and took control, then looted the company of more than 
$100,000, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also wrote a $250,000 check in July, 1991, as a down payment of a San Diego 
hospital, but the check bounced. He persuaded the hospital's board that he was 
wealthy, although he never had more than $8,200 in the account, according to 
trial testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Before sentencing, Russell told the court that he planned to appeal on the 
ground that his attorney was incompetent. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was as predictable as the . . . the sun comes up in the morning that he 
was going to blame his attorney," Ventura County Superior Court Judge James 
McNally said before imposing sentence. The judge also said Russell appears to 
have no skills other than cheating people. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. James D. Cloninger and probation investigators had 
recommended the eight-year sentence, which was the maximum. "It's in Mr. 
Russell's nature to cheat other people," Cloninger said. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Jonathan J. Kissell asked for probation and called a 
probation report "the toughest, hardest one I've ever seen in my life." 
</P>
<P>
 Kissell said Russell's only crime was that he is "a lousy businessman." DWAYNE

 Oxnard officials are staying out of a dispute over a neighborhood council 
election, saying the bylaws governing such groups provide little direction on 
how elections should be conducted, according to a report released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 An investigation into alleged improprieties in the election of La Colonia 
Neighborhood Council representatives has concluded that the city has little 
authority over such matters. 
</P>
<P>
 The report calls for the Inter-Neighborhood Council Committee to speed a 
review of its bylaws to clarify election procedures. The committee addresses 
issues common to the city's 25 neighborhood councils. 
</P>
<P>
 "Generally, the whole philosophy of the program is to have neighborhood 
councils function as autonomously as possible," said Community Services 
Director Jim Faulconer, whose office conducted the investigation. "Rather than 
getting into finger-pointing, I think it's time to move on and work toward the 
future." 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation started after La Colonia residents contended that council 
Chairman Carlos Aguilera rigged the Jan. 5 election by altering city-issued 
election flyers, improperly lobbying during the election and allowing 
under-aged voters to go to the polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, Aguilera's opponents contended that he used heavy-handed tactics to 
quash a recall attempt about a month later. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilera has denied any wrongdoing and a report issued by Faulconer's office 
concluded that "the election processes were conducted fairly and impartially." 
</P>
<P>
 The report also urged a quick end to the simmering feud. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is strongly recommended that both parties in La Colonia put aside their 
differences and work together in an unselfish manner to better the neighborhood 
and the city in a positive way," the report said. "Feuding with each other only 
creates divisiveness, mistrust, more feuding and ultimately leads to bad images 
and negative community results." FRED ALVAREZ

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; FUGITIVE SOUGHT SINCE 1983 IS ARRESTED

<P>
 After being charged with running a prostitution ring and fleeing federal 
authorities for more than a decade, a 47-year-old man has been returned to 
custody after being arrested for drunk driving in Oxnard, authorities said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's deputies in County Jail discovered Angel Enrique Tristani's status 
as a federal fugitive on Wednesday when they ran his fingerprints through a 
statewide identification system.The jailers had become suspicious when Tristani 
claimed to be an Oxnard resident, but held a Nevada driver's license. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the identification system, deputies discovered the man's real name was 
Tristani, not Dino Desetti as he had told Oxnard police. 
</P>
<P>
 John Kirk, a special agent with the FBI, said Tristani has been on a list of 
federal fugitives since he fled the District of Columbia in 1983 after being 
indicted on 15 counts related to prostitution, including pandering. The charges 
stemmed from incidents in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Tristani told authorities that since fleeing in 1983, he has lived in Florida, 
Michigan, Illinois, Alabama, Nevada and California. He said he moved to Oxnard 
about a month ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Kirk said Tristani will be taken back to Washington, D.C., to stand trial once 
his drunk-driving charge in Ventura County is resolved. He is being held in 
County Jail on $26,000 bail. JULIE FIELDS

 Police have concluded a two-month investigation into methamphetamine dealers 
in Ventura and Santa Paula with the arrest of three people and the seizure of 
five pounds of the drug, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramiro Juarez, 38, and Anna Prado, 30, both of Santa Paula, and Manuel 
Gutierrez were taken into custody about 3 p.m. Wednesday in a parking lot near 
the intersection of Seaward Avenue and Harbor Boulevard.Police did not know 
Gutierrez's age or hometown. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura Police Sgt. Bill Bogner said the three, who he described as wholesale 
traffickers, were in the parking lot waiting to sell the drugs to other 
dealers. 
</P>
<P>
 During the arrests, police found five one-pound packages of the powdered 
substance inside the car. The street value of the drugs was estimated at 
$200,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests were made without incident, Bogner said, with the help of about 18 
officers from Ventura, Oxnard and Santa Paula and agents from the U. S. Drug 
Enforcement Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 All three suspects are being held in federal custody in Los Angeles, Bogner 
said. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: VENTURA; REVIEW PANEL LEADER QUITS OVER FUNDING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TINA DAUNT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chairman of a citizens group studying problems in the Ventura County Fire 
Department resigned Thursday night in protest of a Board of Supervisors 
decision to exclude the department from Proposition 172 funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Esty, 83, told about a dozen group members that he is sharply opposed to 
the supervisors' decision earlier this week to bypass the Fire Department and 
give law enforcement agencies an expected $26 million in sales tax revenue 
raised through the voter-approved proposition. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was to go to all the public service departments," Esty said. "To give it 
all to one and nothing to the other doesn't seem reasonable or logical to me." 
</P>
<P>
 Esty also said he was disappointed that Fire Chief George Lund -- citing 
frustrations with the supervisors -- has opted to retire at the end of the 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've only known the gentleman for six months or so, but I found him to be 
very knowledgeable," Esty said.  
</P>
<P>
 Esty's decision to step aside will leave the citizens group in a state of 
flux. The panel -- which includes a variety of government, civic and community 
members -- was formed in October by the Board of Supervisors in response to a 
critical audit of the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The supervisors had hoped the group, which has been meeting twice a month, 
could come up with suggestions to make the department more efficient. The panel 
was expected to issue its findings to the board next month. 
</P>
<P>
 Supervisor Vicky Howard said Thursday that she is disappointed Esty stepped 
down. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a shame he's doing it," Howard said. "It would be much better if Bill 
and George stayed on and worked through this." 
</P>
<P>
 But Supervisor John K. Flynn said he believes the citizens panel should be 
disbanded because, he said, it has become a puppet of the Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been used by the Fire Department instead of being a committee to make 
independent recommendations," Flynn said. "They have become a rubber stamp."

EAST VENTURA: THOUSAND OAKS; MOTORCYCLIST DIES AFTER ACCIDENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Moorpark man died Thursday afternoon in Thousand Oaks after a car struck his 
motorcycle, pushing it into a third vehicle and throwing him to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Arthur Velador, 52, was pronounced dead at 3:10 p.m. at Westlake Medical 
Center, where he had been rushed after the 1:21 p.m. accident at Thousand Oaks 
Boulevard and Pierce Arrow Avenue, a hospital spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County sheriff's deputies reported that Velador was traveling east on 
Thousand Oaks Boulevard when he was struck by a car driven by Kathleen Gray, 
41, of Westlake as she drove out of the North Ranch Mall and across the 
boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 The force of the crash pushed Gray's car and Velador's motorcycle into a third 
car, driven by Laura Plourde, 36, of Port Hueneme. Plourde's car was stopped on 
Pierce Arrow Avenue waiting for traffic to clear, Senior Deputies Bill Therrien 
and Mike Christensen said in a report. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray and Plourde were uninjured, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
 Velador was taken to Westlake Hospital with multiple injuries and admitted in 
critical condition. He died less than two hours later, deputies reported. 
</P>
<P>
 There was no indication any of the drivers was intoxicated at the time, and 
deputies said they are still investigating the crash. MACK REED

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: D.A.'S OFFICE LAUDS NEW STATE GUN LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATTHEW MOSK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ventura County district attorney's office said Thursday that newly amended 
state gun laws would allow prosecutors to take a tougher stance against people 
misusing firearms. 
</P>
<P>
 Certain violations that were once considered misdemeanors can now be 
prosecuted as felonies and could result in a three-year prison sentence, said 
Kevin McGee, the chief deputy district attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're calling this a 'zero tolerance' policy, which for us is a euphemism for 
vigorous enforcement," McGee said. "We hope to send a strong message so that 
people will think twice about misusing a gun." 
</P>
<P>
 The tougher prosecutions will apply to four laws that prohibit people who have 
previously been convicted of crimes from brandishing or concealing a firearm. 
</P>
<P>
 "When criminals illegally possess guns, crimes invariably follow," said Dist. 
Atty. Michael D. Bradbury in a written statement released Thursday. "These laws 
are a step in the right direction. They will help to disarm those who have 
forfeited their right to use or possess firearms because of their prior 
criminal activities." 
</P>
<P>
 McGee said the D. A.'s office will favor felony prosecutions whenever possible 
and will prohibit plea bargains in such cases. MATTHEW MOSK

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: TRUSTEE CRITICIZES DISTRICT HIRING PLAN 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Bringing national politics once again to the monthly board meeting of the 
Ventura County Community College District, a trustee insisted that the 
district's revised affirmative action plan violates the U. S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 The new affirmative action plan was rewritten to bring the district up to 
state and federal standards.It forbids discrimination on the basis of sexual 
orientation, and it added disabled people to the list of underrepresented 
populations that the district should strive to employ and serve. 
</P>
<P>
 "My feeling is that we have hiring quotas," trustee Gregory P. Cole said. "I 
think it violates the 14th Amendment . . . and the spirit and letter of the 
federal Civil Rights Act of 1964." 
</P>
<P>
 Declaring that he could never vote for such a policy, Cole added: "I took an 
oath of office to defend the (U. S.) Constitution and I believe this is 
unconstitutional." 
</P>
<P>
 The plan will not come up for a formal board vote until April, but at Tuesday 
night's meeting, other trustees said they could not agree with Cole. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are not quotas, Dr. Cole, these are targets, and that's the principle 
of the affirmative action plan," trustee Pete Tafoya said. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Timothy Hirschberg said that even though he also opposes quotas, he 
liked the district's policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has strong language and philosophical statements that put the district 
on record as against discrimination," he said. CONSTANCE SOMMER

EAST VENTURA: SIMI VALLEY; QUAKE DAMAGE FORCES FUND-RAISER TO CANCEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Severe earthquake damage to a Simi Valley-area movie ranch has forced the 
city's YMCA to cancel its annual fund-raiser at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 Half of the 20 movie sets at Big Sky Ranch were destroyed in the Jan. 17 
earthquake and repairs to the remaining sets will not be completed in time for 
the fund-raiser, which was planned for the weekend of April 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, which last year drew 10,000 visitors and raised more than $20,000, 
helps pay for YMCA scholarships and youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a great financial boost and a great community event," said Jim King, 
Simi YMCA executive director. "We are desperately thinking of new ideas to 
replace this very special fund-raiser." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past seven years, the YMCA has held the weekend event at the 
9,000-acre ranch, which has been used as the site for television shows such as 
"Little House on the Prairie," "Dallas" and "Gunsmoke." 
</P>
<P>
 The event was the YMCA's second-largest annual drive, King said. The center 
raises the bulk of its funds through a telephone campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The 3,000-member Simi Valley chapter of the YMCA does not operate a gym, 
focusing its efforts on summer camps and licensed child-care centers. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations may be sent to the Simi Valley Family YMCA at 4680 Los Angeles Ave., 
Unit E, 93063. SARA CATANIA

EAST VENTURA: COUNCIL TO FINANCE BRIDGE REPLACEMENT

<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing safety concerns, the Moorpark City Council has agreed to spend about 
$2.5 million to replace an elevated portion of Spring Road that runs across the 
Arroyo Simi. 
</P>
<P>
 Council members voted 4 to 0 Wednesday to move ahead with design of a bridge 
to replace the existing two-lane structure built nearly 50 years ago.Councilman 
Pat Hunter was absent. 
</P>
<P>
 Another option was merely renovating the bridge, but officials decided that 
with $506,000 in federal funds available and another $567,000 toward the 
project already in a city account, replacement made more sense. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need to make a substantial investment in it anyway," Mayor Paul Lawrason 
said. "So I think it's just time to go ahead and do it." 
</P>
<P>
 The new bridge will initially be two lanes with a bicycle and pedestrian 
pathway but will be expandable to four lanes of traffic, council members 
decided. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of the additional $1.5 million needed to replace the bridge has yet 
to be determined, officials said. JAMES MAIELLA JR.

<P>
 Hoping to avoid gaps in the city's review of ordinances, the Moorpark City 
Council has adopted a procedure ensuring that all proposed local laws undergo 
the same scrutiny before they get to the council for action. 
</P>
<P>
 The policy ensures that every proposed ordinance receives a full review by 
staff members, the city manager and city attorney before winding its way onto 
the council dais. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just puts the whole thing into context and shows the flow of approvals and 
cycles," Mayor Paul Lawrason said of the new procedure. "I think this comes 
from the fact that some things have been brought to us that really weren't 
ready for City Council attention." JAMES MAIELLA JR.

RE-CREATING HISTORY; STUDENTS BUILDING REPLICA HONE CARPENTRY SKILLS, LEARN 
ABOUT PAST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Almost three years into planning and building a replica of the first 
schoolhouse in Newbury Park, the high school carpentry students doing the work 
have changed their plans slightly after hearing from a 78-year-old former 
student. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the students are pushing to meet a June completion date, they 
allowed for an alteration to correct a historical inaccuracy in the re-created 
Timber School off Ventu Park Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Margaret Bartel, a former Timber student, visited the construction site 
recently and said the replica correctly has two doors in the front. But there 
should be boys and girls cloakrooms separating the two entrances inside, Bartel 
said, so that change was made. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Josh Luster, who has worked on the one-room building since it was first 
conceived three years ago, said he watched as Bartel walked through the 
building and noted the missing cloakrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't understand the reason behind two different entrances, but like the 
lady said, it was improper for girls to take off a piece of clothing in front 
of guys, even if it was just a coat," said Josh, 17. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though students want to get the building done after months of delays, 
they don't mind the added work required by the changes, Josh said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to try and get it as close to the original as we can," he said. 
"We want to build it up exactly how it was." 
</P>
<P>
 The experience of building the replica as a permanent museum next to the 
historic Stagecoach Inn museum in Newbury Park has given the students more than 
construction experience and credits in shop class, they said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Not only are we building it, we're learning about history," said Shane Hale, 
17, a Newbury Park junior. 
</P>
<P>
 Constructed in 1888, the one-room schoolhouse at Newbury and Kelly roads 
housed first- through eighth-grade students for 30 years before it became the 
school district headquarters in the late 1920s, said Miriam Sprankling, curator 
of history at Stagecoach Inn. The school was torn down half a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum officials and organizers of the building campaign hope to dedicate the 
building this summer. To get the job done, students still need help from 
contractors willing to show them how to install a floor, drywall and 
insulation, teacher Randy Porter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also need a little more money, because I think all the kids who worked on 
this deserve to have a bronze plaque with their names on it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 About 12 to 15 students each year have worked on the building, spending a 
couple of hours every school day sawing, nailing and sanding. Heavy rains 
slowed construction in the spring of 1993; there is no work during summer 
vacation. 
</P>
<P>
 For materials, local Rotary clubs, the Conejo Valley Historical Society, 
Thousand Oaks officials, and the Conejo Recreation and Park District raised 
more than $29,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is certainly a part of our heritage in the Conejo Valley, and we are 
just trying to portray that, to show what it was like to go to school in the 
1880s," Sprankling said. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the museum adds the furnishings it has gathered -- including wrought-iron 
desks, slate boards and a potbellied stove -- the schoolhouse will come alive 
as an educational tool for children, said Dan Overton, a local tax professional 
and chairman of the committee organizing the school project. 
</P>
<P>
 "We already have bookings for student tours," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that people will appreciate the students' work for years to come adds 
a special dimension to the class, ninth-grader Jeremy Hanlon said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a lot easier to work on it knowing it's actually going to be used for 
something good," said Jeremy, 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Josh said he hopes to show the museum to his own children someday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be neat to take my kids here and show them something their dad did when 
he was in high school," he said.

TEACHERS RELUCTANTLY RATIFY 4% SALARY REDUCTION; THOUSAND OAKS: CONTRACT 
APPROVAL COMES AFTER A YEAR OF TALKS. SCHOOL OFFICIALS PRAISE THE DECISION, 
SAYING CUTS COULD NOT BE AVOIDED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Thousand Oaks teachers have given reluctant approval to a 4% pay cut for next 
year -- ratifying a two-year contract with the school district after more than 
a year of talks that led to an impasse requiring state mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he would not release vote totals, teachers' union President John 
Uelmen said Thursday the contract agreement easily won a simple majority among 
the more than 500 teachers who voted. But it did not represent a landslide, he 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a decisive yes, but it wasn't overwhelming," Uelmen said after leaders 
of the United Assn. of Conejo Teachers tallied the votes from balloting on 
Tuesday and Wednesday. "It was a reluctant yes vote," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials praised the teachers' decision, saying the painful cutbacks 
could not be avoided at a time of dwindling state money for education. The 
school board will vote on the agreement March 24, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not a wonderful thing to take less money and fewer benefits for 
employees who are so vitally important to our operation," Personnel Director 
Leann Nemeroff said. "You cannot pay enough to a good teacher." 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement only covers the current school year and next year, so the two 
sides will have to return to the bargaining table in less than 12 months, 
Nemeroff said. The negotiations will not get easier with time, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks as if we'll have to make additional (budget) cuts at that time," 
Nemeroff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Next year's pay cut reduces what a beginning teacher will make to $28,037 from 
a previous first-year level of $29,365, Uelmen said. At the top of the scale, 
teachers who have worked 14 years or longer with a master's degree will see 
their income drop from $52,982 to $51,109, Uelmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Linda Derahian, president of the Conejo Valley Parent-Teacher Assn., said both 
sides deserved credit for giving in a little. 
</P>
<P>
 For its part, the school district agreed to allow membership in the union to 
become mandatory. Membership now is voluntary, and about 569 of the district's 
683 teachers belong. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's certainly courageous of the teachers to agree to cuts without a 
strike," Derahian said. "I don't know what other alternatives there were." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to cutting pay by 3%, the contract agreement calls for shortening 
the work year by two days. The shortened schedule would lower teacher salaries 
an additional 1% for a total of 4%. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers also agreed to pay more of their health costs. If approved by the 
school board, the contract would raise the deductible for medical costs to $250 
from $150 per individual. Insurance coverage to dependents would be cut off at 
19, rather than the current limit of 25 for full-time students. 
</P>
<P>
 Teachers have been working under an expired three-year contract this school 
year while the two sides tried to work out a compromise. An impasse was 
declared in January, and two sessions with a state mediator in February led to 
the agreement.

CLINICAL LAB THAT EMPLOYS 516 WILL CLOSE; NEWBURY PARK: CITY OFFICIALS SAY 
DAMON FACILITY'S SCHEDULED CLOSURE BY SEPTEMBER WILL HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON THE 
LOCAL ECONOMY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Newbury Park clinical laboratory that employs 516 people will be closing its 
doors by September in a company consolidation that Thousand Oaks officials say 
should have only a limited effect on the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Headley, president and chief executive of Physicians Clinical 
Laboratory Inc., announced this week the slated closure of the Damon Corp. 
facility as part of his company's recent $51-million acquisition of Damon. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the closure would have little effect on the local economy 
because it would be offset by incoming business and planned expansions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday approved biotechnology giant Amgen's 
proposal to make room for 6,300 new workers over the next 25 years by building 
additional offices, warehouses, manufacturing plants and research labs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly glad that the city in their wisdom passed the approval of the 
Amgen Specific Plan so that they can make up the shortfall that we may feel 
from this closure," said Steve Rubenstein, president of the Conejo Valley 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're extremely lucky and blessed in our community in that we're a highly 
desirable place to live and there have been a number of companies looking to 
our area after the earthquake for their relocation purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Headley said his company plans to reassign workers from the Newbury Park 
facility and a PCL lab in Glendale to a newly built laboratory near Burbank 
Airport. He said, however, that some of the positions in Newbury Park and 
Glendale will be lost in the transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some downsizing," he said. "It's impossible for me to tell you 
how much at this point. Obviously when you put two large facilities together 
there will be some downsizing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 About 225 of the Damon workers live in the Thousand Oaks/Newbury Park area, 
company officials said, with the rest coming from both Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In mapping its future strategy, Headley said PCL had two reasons for deciding 
to close two of its facilities and build a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 Headley said combining the two facilities would make the business more 
efficient and centrally located. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second reason is that Newbury Park is substantially removed from the 
greater Los Angeles area, putting a lot of strain on courier routes. So, 
logistically, it doesn't make sense to maintain an area that far away." 
</P>
<P>
 PCL conducts 16,000 clinical tests daily statewide, and after the merger takes 
effect it will be conducting 25,000 tests daily, Headley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a clinical laboratory operation," Headley said. "We perform laboratory 
tests in support of doctors' offices, doctor groups, clinics and hospitals in 
quite large volume." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo said he was disappointed to hear of 
Damon's planned exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 "How depressing," he said. "We enjoy people moving in and we don't enjoy 
businesses leaving. I think that if the city can be involved in helping in some 
way to keep them here, that's one thing. But if it's a business decision to 
consolidate, I feel kind of helpless."

MIXING MEDIA; 'WORDS AND SYMBOLS' SPOTLIGHTS AGE-OLD ART ELEMENTS -- AND THE 
VARIED LANGUAGE OF THEIR COMBINATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY KAPITANOFF, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Nancy Kapitanoff writes regularly 
about art for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Within the visual language of art, words and symbols have established a secure 
place. 
</P>
<P>
 Symbols have been an important element since cave-dwellers left their marks on 
cave walls. The inclusion of words in art was not so prevalent until the early 
20th Century, when collage began to flourish. 
</P>
<P>
 In the exhibit "Words and Symbols," at Artspace Gallery in Woodland Hills, 
curator Scott Canty brings together the work of nine contemporary artists who 
use these elements to convey a broad range of ideas and emotions. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always been fascinated with artists who use symbols in their work," 
Canty said. Some of the symbols "are very personal, others universal." 
</P>
<P>
 In his curator's statement, he reflects on the progress of words and symbols 
in art from prehistoric times to present day, and writes: "In this exhibit we 
see how words become symbols and symbols become words. . . . Individuals have 
continued to develop a symbolic language in order to communicate their 
innermost feelings, thoughts and desires." 
</P>
<P>
 Michael McCall employs abstract and representational symbols to journey 
through the universe from the beginning of time to its end in "Alpha / Omega." 
With sand and acrylic, enamel and gold lacquer paints, his luminous grid (read 
left to right, top to bottom) takes us from the cosmos and the world's genesis 
through the advent of plant life, basic to complex animal life, human life, 
philosophy and religion. A money bag is followed directly by bombs, atomic 
energy and the end of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 In a decidedly more upbeat work, McCall presents the Japanese and Chinese 
symbols for "Long Life . . . Good Luck." The colors are bold, the characters 
sharp and alive in the four oil-on-canvas paintings that make up this piece. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Bouchard focuses on dual cultures in cast-paper works such as "Line in 
the Sand 6." Combining cast paper with sand, gauze and acrylic on canvas, this 
work juxtaposes Hebrew and Arabic in a peaceful coexistence. 
</P>
<P>
 "His early work dealt with peace and conflict with flags," Canty said. "Some 
had gone through war, were torn apart, but they were still flying. He's still 
taking the idea of flags as a way of identifying groups." 
</P>
<P>
 The X and the Y, symbols for female and male chromosomes, can be found in Tony 
Ramos' abstract mixed-media visions of dreams. The snake and the moon may also 
be there, or a dome with a half circle over it. 
</P>
<P>
 The latter symbolizes "a myth that relates to the aborigines," Canty said. 
"Ramos talks a lot about his roots in his work, and who we are on this planet." 
</P>
<P>
 Doug Cluff's steel and carved wood pieces covered with black varnish are 
manifestations of personal emotions. Canty explained that "Accumulation of 
Effect" was inspired by Cluff's reading of a book about a plague-affected 
village. We, the living, look in on the dead. The long, punching-bag-like forms 
represent bodies, the holes in them the wounds of disease, starvation and war. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicholette Kominos captures the simplicity, fragility and richness of life by 
setting objects from everyday life -- spoons, plates, cups, flowers -- against 
textured white backgrounds made from drywall and foam. "The drawings and the 
way the pieces are made seem to be very innocent, but they have a 
sophistication that a child couldn't do," Canty said. 
</P>
<P>
 In charcoal-on-paper drawings such as "Bust, Vessels" and "Infant Saviors," 
Brad Coleman renders familiar symbols of Christianity in dramatic, highly 
emotional ways. Dennis Hollingsworth uses words or parts of words to play with 
space. The letter forms of "Untitled (Flowers in Jail 2)" stand in front of the 
central image of the flower, giving the impression that there's a third 
dimension to this painting. 
</P>
<P>
 Though in one artwork the words may foster understanding of the piece, in 
another they could be the core of its mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 The writing in Kathi Martin's constructions and collages "carries you through 
the piece," Canty said. One "Game Table" contains Little Rascals images, 
another Tarot cards. "She attracts you with the images and color, and then hits 
you with a good one (with the narrative). They're more about the games in 
life." 
</P>
<P>
 One can try to pick out individual words in Barbara Romain's large mixed-media 
work, "Herstory and History," and succeed, but that would only suggest part of 
the story. The cacophony of words in these life-size images -- "History" done 
in blue, "Herstory" in pink, he somewhat bigger than she -- creates a frenzied 
aura that communicates the larger picture here. 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing her work, Canty said: "I feel like I'm in the midst of the busiest 
city with lights and neon, and everyone wants your attention. You are being so 
over-sensitized with all of this coming at you." WHERE AND WHEN 
</P>
<P>
 What: "Words and Symbols." 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Artspace Gallery, 21800 Oxnard St., Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: Noon to 5 p.m. Tuesdays through Saturdays. Ends April 16. Also, 
"Conversations With the Artists" begin at 1:30 p.m. March 12.

JUDGING BY THE GESTALT ; PETER LEFCOURT'S 'THE AUDIT' IS A NEW MORALITY PLAY 
THAT EXAMINES HOW A MAN'S LIFE IS EVALUATED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANICE ARKATOV, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Janice Arkatov writes about theater 
for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 "No one is just good or bad," Peter Lefcourt says. "In all of us, there's the 
capacity for goodness and evil. People are complex." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of Leonard Mills, the anti-hero protagonist of Lefcourt's 
"The Audit," making its world premiere tonight in Actors Alley's temporary home 
at Valley College's Horseshoe Theater. 
</P>
<P>
 "I based the character on my Uncle Leroy," the New York native noted. "He was 
quite a character. He made a million in real estate and lost it in the stock 
market -- or vice versa. He had several ex-wives. He was charming, warm, 
loving, flamboyant, a womanizer. . . . He led an up-and-down life. I've always 
been interested in people like that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefcourt -- who's shown a sly and whimsical touch in his previous Actors Alley 
outings: "Only the Dead Know Burbank" (1989), "Sweet Talk" (1991) and "La Ronde 
de Lunch" (1992) -- admits that this wasn't his smoothest effort; after penning 
the first act in 1991, he felt that he'd written himself into a corner and 
promptly shelved the script -- until Actors Alley artistic director Jeremiah 
Morris asked to read it and promptly put it on the schedule to launch the 
theater's season. 
</P>
<P>
 (The opening of that season -- and the company's long-in-the-works renovation 
of Actors Alley's new home, the El Portal Theatre in North Hollywood, was dealt 
a devastating blow by the Jan. 17 earthquake, canceling the planned Feb. 4 twin 
openings of "The Audit" and "The Male Animal." "Animal" will now open at Valley 
College's Little Theatre on April 8.) 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never worked so well or so happily with anyone," said director Morris, 
who also staged "La Ronde de Lunch." "It's the whole concept: 'What is a man's 
worth? What do you judge it by? What moment?' Of course, you don't do it by 
moments. You judge by the gestalt , the whole thing. Sure, doing this makes you 
think about your mortality. But I've been dealing with that for a long time -- 
since I had a heart attack at 40." 
</P>
<P>
 The play's central character is less fortunate: He doesn't recover. In Act 1, 
set in an intensive care unit, we meet the principal figures from Leonard 
Mills' life: his two ex-wives, father, son and daughter. Act 2 takes place in 
an unusual "auditor's" office, where the departed Mills undergoes "a 
Sartre-esque trial by computer," Lefcourt said. "The computer picks out random 
dates and times, and we go back and see what happened -- the actors play out 
the scenes." 
</P>
<P>
 Lefcourt, whose TV writing credits include "Eight Is Enough" and a 1984 Emmy 
for work in "Cagney & Lacey," is also the author of two highly praised novels, 
"The Deal" and "The Dreyfus Affair: A Love Story"; he hopes that the latter 
will soon go the movie route. Also upcoming: this summer's opening of "Sweet 
Talk" at Vermont's Oldcastle Theatre, and a spy movie with Roger Moore, written 
for CBS. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Audit," Lefcourt acknowledges, is a major switch of gears. 
</P>
<P>
 "Although there's a lot of comedy, it is my most serious play," he said. "It's 
a morality play, hopefully illuminating. I chose the metaphor of the audit 
because it's something that deals with profits and losses. Yet what we all want 
is a sense of judgment, of meaning -- not just a list of assets and 
liabilities. The irony of the title is, it doesn't do justice to evaluating a 
life. We tend to judge things by extremes. But people are so various, so gray." 
WHERE AND WHEN

MATURING GRACEFULLY; IN 'WOMEN OF MANHATTAN,' SHANLEY WROTE DIALOGUE THAT 
AFFECTIONATELY CAPTURES THE ESSENCE OF HIS PROTAGONISTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; T.H. McCulloh writes about theater 
regularly for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 John Patrick Shanley sidestepped his well-trodden path when he wrote "Women of 
Manhattan." Shanley aficionados shouldn't look here for the violence of "Danny 
and the Deep Blue Sea" or the deeply toned ethnicity of his plays and films 
about the Italian-American experience in New York. These women belong in Wendy 
Wasserstein country in Beth Henleyland. 
</P>
<P>
 What audiences may be pleasantly surprised to find in this effervescent 
production at the Little Victory is that Shanley can do what many other male 
playwrights can't, and that is write dialogue for women accurately and 
affectionately. 
</P>
<P>
 Shanley's three protagonists, successful college friends who are all replanted 
Manhattanites, bond and, refreshingly, believe in themselves as individuals, 
though never so fiercely as their male counterparts, nor so shallowly. 
</P>
<P>
 Their problems are distinctive. Rhonda has just been deserted by a guy named 
Jerry, but keeps his red sneakers in her living room, just in case. Billie is 
caught in an empty marriage and has affairs to fulfill herself. Judy can't seem 
to pick a guy who isn't gay, and her romantic desperation keeps bouncing off 
the closet. She is panicky over her frustration. 
</P>
<P>
 Does Shanley sound misogynistic at this point? Don't believe it. He feels 
empathy for his women and puts much of the blame on the men in their lives. 
Jerry was an unfeeling jerk. Billie's husband, Bob, is as emotionless and 
self-involved as an oyster. 
</P>
<P>
 Director Katherine Huston allows Shanley's humor to bubble around his insights 
into the female id while not ignoring the birthing pains of the women's 
maturity. And she makes it plain that, at the final curtain, they are very 
different from when we first meet them. 
</P>
<P>
 The men in their lives face problems just as explicit. If Billie's barbecue 
scene with her husband shows a couple as empty and uncommunicative as they can 
be, it's an honest look at why Billie strays. If the conversation in the 
restaurant scene in which Judy meets her blind date, one of Billie's 
unregenerate macho tricks, is disorganized and quirky, it's an insight into 
what may trigger Judy's emotional recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The performances also bubble. Of course David Salper's Bob is as interesting 
as a plate of glass, and Anthony Winters' blind date Duke is annoying as an 
unreachable itch. But that's the point of their being there, and they each have 
enough charm to make it logical that the women find them attractive. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's the women's show. Lisa Lund's Rhonda is a loving portrait of a woman 
who will be wise after life has worn her down a bit, and Diana Gunther's Billie 
grows from an insecure bimbo-like stereotype into a wife who finds her 
husband's uncharacteristic and momentary abuse a key to opening gates that have 
kept them apart. 
</P>
<P>
 Corny Koehl's Judy is at the center of Shanley's triptych, and Koehl makes her 
most difficult and opaque moments work like a charm. She is so honestly 
vulnerable she makes you want to hug her. It's a multihued performance that 
makes every facet of Shanley's writing shine. WHERE AND WHEN

JAZZ TUNES, LOCAL ROOMS; NEARLY TWO DOZEN VALLEY CLUBS FOCUS ON AROUND-TOWN 
TALENT, WITH A WIDE VARIETY OF ENTERTAINMENT. NAMES AREN'T BIG, BUT THE SOUND 
IS.

<P>
 Through the years, jazz has blossomed at venues scattered all over Southern 
California. Beginning with the Cotton Club in Culver City in the '30s up to the 
Catalina Bar & Grill in Hollywood today, jazz greats and near-greats have 
played to packed rooms. 
</P>
<P>
 One other clime has, for at least three decades, steadfastly offered listeners 
a wide variety of jazz entertainment -- the San Fernando Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Valley jazz clubs, which occasionally feature top-name traveling artists, have 
mostly been home to local residents. Take the Baked Potato, opened in 1970 by 
pianist Don Randi. Saxophonist Tom Scott's L. A. Express, a top '70s band, came 
together at the Potato, and L. A.-based guitarists Larry Carlton and Lee 
Ritenour developed themselves as performers there. 
</P>
<P>
 This focus on local talent remains the key strength of Valley clubs. The 
Potato still spotlights area artists, from Randi, an Agoura resident, to 
guitarist Frank Gambale of Sepulveda. Jax in Glendale showcases local 
mainstream jazz and jazz-pop musicians such as pianists Cecilia Coleman and 
Frank Strazzeri and saxophonists Sonya Jason and Jim Marentic. And the Room 
Upstairs at Le Cafe in Sherman Oaks has long been a supporter of such artists 
as Brazilian-based guitarist Ricardo Silveira and Latin-jazz keyboardist Clare 
Fischer. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, there are verging on two dozen Valley rooms that feature jazz on 
an at least once-a-week basis, making the area a main hub of Southern 
California jazz. And while you won't see the big names that often, you'll 
consistently get a solid sample of some of Southern California's jazz bedrock 
-- the players who often don't always get the wide exposure, but who frequently 
back up or appear alongside the headliners in recording sessions and live 
shows. These artists, names or not, provide the goods with outstanding musical 
performances. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clubs  
</P>
<P>
 Baked Potato, 3787 Cahuenga Blvd. West, Studio City. (818) 980-1615. 
</P>
<P>
 This 85-seat room has the honor of being Southern California's oldest 
continually operating jazz room. In the '70s, pianist Randi spotlighted more 
straight-ahead jazz. He's still the regular Friday-Saturday attraction, playing 
a foot-tapping mix of contemporary and mainstream jazz piano. But since the 
early '80s, the box-shaped room that offers excellent sight lines to the stage 
from just about anywhere has been given over almost entirely to 
leaning-toward-loud jazz-fusion bands, with players sporting plenty of electric 
instruments to get their message across. 
</P>
<P>
 Music from 9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. nightly. Cover varies, two-drink minimum. The 
menu consists mostly of -- oh, you guessed! -- a variety of meal-sized baked 
potatoes stuffed with everything from Cheddar cheese and spinach to steak. 
</P>
<P>
 Cafe Sierra, Universal City Hilton and Towers, 555 Universal Terrace Parkway, 
Universal City. (818) 506-2500. 
</P>
<P>
 Perched right in the front of this large, plant-laden room is a baby grand 
piano, on which various pianists play jazz 5 to 7 p.m. Mondays through Fridays. 
No cover. Full menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Casey's Tavern, 22029 Sherman Way, Canoga Park. (818) 992-9362. 
</P>
<P>
 This windowless joint -- discovered when you open a couple of plain metal 
doors that hide the treasures within -- has been the Valley's primary home to 
Dixieland jazz for more than a decade. Four nights a week, it's just a watering 
hole, with a big Miller Lite sign over the pool table, a long, angled wooden 
bar and such appointments as a mirrored sign for Paddy Irish whiskey hanging 
over drawings of pianist Willie (The Lion) Smith and soprano saxophonist Sidney 
Bechet. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Thursdays, Saturdays and Sundays, owner Lee Casey's crew pushes some 
back-of-the-room tables out of the way and in come the bands, with such names 
as the Jelly Roll Jazz Band, the Tin Pan Valley jazz band and the Great Pacific 
Jazz Band. 
</P>
<P>
 The clientele, according to bartender Bob Stoll, is animated, though not 
exactly youthful. "The average age of a Casey's customer is deceased," he 
cracked, "and that includes the bartenders." Even if there's no band, Casey's 
boasts a great jukebox, packed with such goodies as Erroll Garner's "Misty," 
Kid Ory's "St. Louis Blues" and Ella Fitzgerald's first hit, the 1938 
"A-Tisket, A-Tasket." 
</P>
<P>
 Music 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. Saturdays, 6 to 9 p.m. Sundays, and 8:30 to 11:30 p.m. 
Thursdays. No cover, two-drink minimum. Peanut snacks only. 
</P>
<P>
 Cha Cha Cha, 17499 Ventura Blvd., Encino. (818) 789-3600. 
</P>
<P>
 This restaurant, with its barnlike spaciousness, looks stunning. The pale wood 
walls are adorned with paintings that have a magical, childlike motif, and an 
ancient map of the Caribbean is painted on the polished cement floor. Mostly 
instrumental Latin and Brazilian jazz and reggae are offered, with regulars 
bassist Marco Mendoza and keyboardist Ottomaro Ruiz. 
</P>
<P>
 Music 9:15 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays. No cover or minimum. 
Caribbean cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Chadney's, 3000 W. Olive Ave., Burbank. (818) 843-5333. 
</P>
<P>
 The homey, 70-seat bar and lounge has been providing first-rate jazz for 
years. In the '70s, the establishment was called the Carriage House and hosted 
the vibrant duo of pianist Jimmy Rowles and bassist Monty Budwig. Now, as 
Chadney's, the room's jazz cache has grown under a booking policy implemented 
by Dennis Duke, who for years handled those duties at the nearby Money Tree. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuesdays through Saturdays, you'll find such artists as drummer Earl Palmer -- 
recently inducted into the R&B Hall of Fame for his work on New Orleans-based 
recording sessions with Fats Domino and others in the '50s -- trumpeters Bill 
Berry and Jack Sheldon, saxophonist John Bolivar and singer Dennis Rowland. 
</P>
<P>
 Music 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. Tuesday through Thursday, 9:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Friday 
and Saturday. No cover or minimum. Full menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Cobalt Cafe, 22047 Sherman Way, Canoga Park. (818) 348-3789. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz nights are Sundays and Thursdays at this coffeehouse. Bob Harsen, Mike 
Dubin and Brad Rabuchin are the regulars. Bands start at 9 p.m. No cover, 
one-drink minimum. Light fare, including vegetarian sandwiches and salads. 
</P>
<P>
 Common Grounds, 9250 Reseda Blvd., Northridge. (818) 882-3666. 
</P>
<P>
 The comfy 50-seat coffeehouse spotlights jazz on Mondays. Regulars are 
guitarist Rick Zunigar, Rob Van Jazz and the Weller Brothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Music from 9 p.m. to midnight. No cover, $2.50 minimum. Full menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Duet, 900 N. Central Ave., Glendale. (818) 240-0808. 
</P>
<P>
 This 250-seat restaurant serves more than modern California cuisine in its 
crisp environs. On Tuesdays, Duet features pianist Sydney Lehman, reed man 
Steve Carr and their guests, offering a selection of originals and jazz 
standards in the upstairs lounge. 
</P>
<P>
 Music 7 to 10 p.m. Tuesdays. No cover, no minimum. Full menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack's Cinnamon Cinder, 4311 W. Magnolia Blvd., Burbank. (818) 845-1121. 
</P>
<P>
 This good-sized joint -- it holds well more than 200 folks -- features country 
music every night -- and the decor shows it with its Western-style landscape. 
But around lunchtime each Tuesday and Thursday, a bunch from the nearby studios 
-- Kay Wade and Don Nelson among them -- plays Dixieland jazz. And on Sundays, 
except during football season, big bands led by the likes of Jimmy McConnell 
and Ladd McIntosh hold forth. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz from noon to 1 p.m. Tuesdays and Thursdays, 2 to 7 p.m. Sundays. No 
cover, no minimum. Full menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Jax, 339 N. Brand Blvd., Glendale. (818) 500-1604. 
</P>
<P>
 The room is skinny and long -- for just a second you might think you'd walked 
into that most hallowed of jazz bars: Bradley's in Manhattan. But then you look 
around, see the stained-glass windows over the bar, the trombones and clarinets 
tacked to the walls, the poster above one booth that hisses, "Hot Jazz." 
Obviously, Jax is not just a serious, subdued jazz room. People come here 
mostly to eat, talk, flirt and so on, and they get music tossed in in the 
bargain. 
</P>
<P>
 And a lot of good music emanates from the bandstand tucked into a niche at the 
end of the bar, though the sounds are sometimes hard to hear over the 
he-said-she-said clamor. The artists range from the new and exuberant -- Sonya 
Jason, Soma Quartet, Mindi Abair -- to the veteran and respected -- Mike 
Campbell, Frank Strazzeri, Bill Perkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Music from 9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Fridays and Saturdays, 7:30 to 11:30 p.m. 
Sundays, and 9 p.m. to 1 a.m. Mondays through Thursdays. No cover or minimum. 
Full menu. 
</P>
<P>
 J.P.'s Lounge, 3718 W. Magnolia Blvd., Burbank. (818) 845-1800. 
</P>
<P>
 This no-frills establishment is a neighborhood joint with a warm feel that 
features quality mainstream jazz and pop music. Guest musicians, egged on by 
down-home keyboardist Karen Hernandez and drummer Frank Wilson, carry on 
Thursdays through Saturdays in the anything-but-elaborate lounge room -- which 
has brick walls, mirrors surrounded by strands of little clear flickering 
lights and glass-topped tables. 
</P>
<P>
 Recently, Maurice Davis knocked out "It's All Right With Me" and "St. Louis 
Blues," and when Hernandez soloed, she made her keyboard sound like an organ. 
All right! 
</P>
<P>
 Singer Margaret Love, 9 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Wednesdays; Hernandez and Wilson 9 
p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Thursdays through Saturdays. No cover, one-drink minimum. 
Full menu. 
</P>
<P>
 J.P.'s Money Tree, 10149 Riverside Drive, North Hollywood. (818) 769-8800. 
</P>
<P>
 With its green Naugahyde booths, here-and-there reading lamps, fresh flowers 
on the tables and photographs of Louis Armstrong, Al Hirt and Charlie Parker, 
the Money Tree is the rich cousin of J.P.'s Lounge. The 100-seat room has been 
around for a couple of decades, and these days, the standard of the music is 
pretty high. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursdays through Saturdays, pianist Page Cavanaugh's trio (with guitarist Al 
Viola and bassist Phil Mallory) spiritedly deliver tunes you may never have 
heard of unless you were born in the '30s and '40s. But ditties like "Shootin' 
High" and "M'amselle" are fun, especially when Cavanaugh sings them in his 
scratchy tenor. The solos by the pianist and Viola -- a fine guitarist -- add 
to the party. 
</P>
<P>
 Sundays, Jack Sheldon does it all -- plays trumpet, sings, employs 
considerable wit -- and brings along pianist Ross Tompkins to boot. Mondays 
through Wednesdays belong to Karen Hernandez and Frank Wilson, and their 
followers. 
</P>
<P>
 Music seven nights, 9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. No cover or minimum. Continental 
cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Las Hadas Cantina, 9048 Balboa Blvd., Northridge. (818) 892-7271. 
</P>
<P>
 This open, tiled-floor Mexican restaurant, in the corner of a shopping center, 
on Wednesdays offers Joe Vento's ragged-but-occasionally-right Big Band 
All-Stars, with singer Susan Morse. 
</P>
<P>
 Music from 7:30 to 11 p.m. No cover or minimum. Full Mexican menu. 
</P>
<P>
 La Ve Lee, 12514 Ventura Blvd., Studio City. (818) 980-8158. 
</P>
<P>
 This low-ceilinged, low-lighted user-friendly spot, where music has been on 
tap for about seven years, used to focus on Brazilian jazz. Nowadays, owner 
Eddie Arbi really mixes it up, offering a smattering of R&B, jazz, blues and 
funk, as well as Latin and, yes, Brazilian jazz. The policy that Arbi and the 
room's booker, Olivier Vabois, employ obviously works, as the 100-seat room is 
regularly packed. There's a core crew of performers, among them singer Eliane 
Estevao, conga drummer Poncho Sanchez and R&B men Marco Mendoza and Bruce 
Conte, and such names as Armand Sabal-Lecco and Scott Henderson spice up the 
roster. The bands play pretty loud sometimes, but the people at the front 
tables don't seem to notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Music shows at 9:30 and 11:30 p.m. Tuesdays through Sundays. Cover $5 to $10, 
two-drink minimum. Mediterranean cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobby Bar, in the Warner Center Marriott, 21850 Oxnard St., Woodland Hills. 
(818) 887-4800. 
</P>
<P>
 Lounge on the comfy chairs and couches, surround yourself with lush greenery 
and enjoy the solid piano-bass-drums jazz trio called Smooth Tips. 
</P>
<P>
 Music 8 p.m. to midnight Fridays and Saturdays. No cover or minimum. 
Appetizers. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch's Java 'N' Jazz, 22722 Lyons Ave., No. 1, Valencia. (805) 254-7500. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitch McMullen opened this coffeehouse about a year ago, and is proud of its 
European atmosphere, down to the wooden walls and floors painted to look old. 
Jazz competes with folk, pop, reggae and gospel groups for space, with anything 
from Latin to fusion to mainstream on tap about three nights a week. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulars include young trumpet whiz Gilbert Castellanos, who plays with 
Black/Note, and pianist Johnny (Hammond) Smith. There's room for about 100 
patrons. 
</P>
<P>
 Music from about 7 p.m. to 1 a.m. seven nights. Cover $1 Thursdays through 
Saturdays; no cover other nights. One-drink minimum. Soups, sandwiches and 
desserts available, along with the typical cups of joe. 
</P>
<P>
 Moonlight Tango Cafe, 13730 Ventura Blvd., Sherman Oaks. (818) 788-2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The airy, bright room that features singing waitresses and waiters and a natty 
dance band on weekends goes for big bands on Tuesdays. The town's best large 
ensembles have played here, including bands led by Bill Holman, Frank Capp, Bob 
Florence and Ray Anthony. 
</P>
<P>
 Big band shows at 8 and 10 p.m. Tuesdays. Cover varies from $10 to $15, 
two-drink minimum. Continental cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Monteleone's West, 19937 Ventura Blvd., Tarzana. (818) 996-0662. 
</P>
<P>
 Walk into Monteleone's and you immediately feel the glow of the understated 
lighting, appreciate how the brass and wood appointments give the establishment 
a sense of quiet elegance. The cozy room -- the dining room-bar area seats 
about 75 -- has a comfortable ambience, which may be why owner Tom Monteleone 
has been a successful Valley restaurant and club owner for 23 years, with 13 at 
this location. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't a jazz club. It's really a supper club for people who want 
entertainment while they eat," says Monteleone. The musicians and singers who 
work here aren't always strictly jazz, but they all offer some classic pop 
material from the '40s and '50s. 
</P>
<P>
 Music 7 to 11:30 p.m. Sunday through Thursday, 9 p.m. to 1:30 a.m. Friday and 
Saturday. No cover, $15 minimum Friday and Saturday, no cover or minimum other 
days. Continental cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
 Muddy Moose Bar & Grill at the Sportsmen's Lodge, 12833 Ventura Blvd., Studio 
City. (818) 984-0202. 
</P>
<P>
 This room with contrasting decor -- a Southwestern motif in one room, 
everything from toboggans to metal divers' helmets on an upper shelf in another 
-- hosts various contemporary jazz groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Music from 8:30 to midnight Fridays and Saturdays. No cover or minimum. Full 
menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Red Vest Pizza Parlor, 12639 Glenoaks Blvd., Sylmar. (818) 362-1536. 
</P>
<P>
 This pizza house, decked out with the usual beer signs and three big-screen 
TVs, features Dixieland with the Jazzin' Babies Jazz Band each Wednesday from 
7:30 to 10 p.m. No cover, $5 minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 The Room Upstairs at Le Cafe, 14633 Ventura Blvd,, Sherman Oaks. (818) 
986-2662. 
</P>
<P>
 The Room Upstairs began 13 years ago as a place to sing for Lois Boileau, one 
of the owners of this restaurant-nightclub. As the music policy expanded from 
weekends to seven nights a week, the artists booked changed as well. For some 
time, the accent was on jazz-fusion bands. These groups played far too loudly 
in the tiny, 60-seat enclave that makes you feel as if the musicians are 
playing in your front room. 
</P>
<P>
 For the past couple of years, owner-booker Dale Jaffe has selected acts that 
better suit his space, from such singers as Sue Raney, Shelby Flint and Mare 
Winingham to Brazilian artists Ricardo Silveira and Bill Cantos. 
</P>
<P>
 Jaffe still goes for jazz people who play with energy -- saxman Evertte Harp, 
bassist Bunny Brunel -- and occasionally does it up big, booking an out-of-town 
surprise, such as the Brazilian vocal quartet Bova Livre. The variety, and 
ambience, have made the Room Upstairs one of the most important Los 
Angeles-area jazz haunts. 
</P>
<P>
 Music at 9 and 11 p.m. Friday and Saturday, 8 and 10 p.m. Sundays through 
Thursdays. Cover varies between $2 and $15, two-drink minimum. No food, full 
menu available downstairs in Le Cafe. 
</P>
<P>
 Shakey's Pizza, 26781 Bouquet Canyon Road, Saugus. (805) 296-8566. 
</P>
<P>
 Here's another pizza place that, besides the pies, the video games in the game 
room and the sports on two 27-inch overhead TVs, features jazz each week with 
the Good Time Band. 
</P>
<P>
 Music 7:30 to 10:30 p.m. Fridays only. No cover, no minimum. Full menu. 
</P>
<P>
 Skoby's, 20419 Devonshire St., Chatsworth. (818) 718-0433. 
</P>
<P>
 Skoby's mainly functions as a restaurant, but there's a small bar and lounge 
on the western side where pianist Michelle Farber's trio is a Saturday 
mainstay. 
</P>
<P>
 Jazz 8 p.m. to 12:30 a.m. Saturdays, no cover, two-drink minimum. Full menu.

HARD ROCK OF AGES; METAL HEROES BLACK SABBATH ARE STILL GOING STRONG AFTER MORE 
THAN TWO DECADES AND DRAWING A NEW GENERATION OF EUPHORIC, STAGE-DIVING FANS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE APPLEFORD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Steve Appleford writes regularly 
about music for The Times. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The front row at a recent Black Sabbath tour stop offered the seminal hard 
rock outfit a glimpse of the future. At the head of the crowd: a 5-year-old boy 
and his father rocking in tandem to the band's pounding Gothic rhythms. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that was pretty wicked, to have this young kid bopping away with 
his dad there," singer Tony Martin said with a laugh, calling from a Chicago 
hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin was a bit worried that the boy might cushion a fall by one of the 
euphoric stage-divers who greet Sabbath's every gig on this tour, which arrives 
tonight at the Universal Amphitheatre with guests Motorhead and Morbid Angel. 
</P>
<P>
 The band is crossing those kinds of generational boundaries these days, after 
more than two decades as towering metal heroes and critical pariahs. 
</P>
<P>
 Black Sabbath's reputation rests on its creation of such roaring rock anthems 
as "Iron Man" and spawning the career of founding vocalist and rock funnyman 
Ozzy Osbourne. But the British rockers are now also cited as a key influence on 
such new grunge-masters as Nirvana. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the road, a lot of bands are coming up and saying, 'Without you, I 
wouldn't be here, I wouldn't be playing,' " said guitarist Tony Iommi, who 
founded the band with his Birmingham, U. K., schoolmates Osbourne and bassist 
Geezer Butler in 1968. "That's a great feeling, to know that you've done 
something and made somebody's life better." 
</P>
<P>
 The current tour ultimately takes the band to Japan and Europe, and offers 
fans a mix of songs from Sabbath's new "Cross Purposes" album, with material 
spanning the band's grinding repertoire. That's because Martin, who joined in 
1987, wanted to mark his fourth world tour with the band by demonstrating "the 
fact that Sabbath has got a lot of history, and it is well worth putting it out 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 The new album is the band's third for IRS Records and follows a short-lived 
reunion in 1992 with singer Ronnie James Dio, who replaced Osbourne in 1979 
before leaving for his own solo career a few years later. The latest break 
between Dio and Sabbath came last year with the band's decision to perform with 
Osbourne at a special onetime concert in Costa Mesa. Dio was invited to 
participate, but refused. 
</P>
<P>
 For the others, Iommi said, the show was a pleasant reunion of the band's 
original members, who had last performed together in 1985 at the Live Aid 
benefit. And soon Osbourne suggested embarking on a full tour together, then a 
live album, followed by a possible new studio album. 
</P>
<P>
 "After eight months of negotiations, everybody agreed to do a tour. We signed 
our deal and sent it to Ozzy's office," Iommi said. "Then we got a fax back 
from Ozzy's office saying, 'I'm not ready to do it yet.' And that was it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I still don't know the reason really because I haven't spoke to Ozzy since, 
for some reason. We'll see in the future." 
</P>
<P>
 Martin didn't appear to mind all these reunion projects with other singers and 
even encouraged the Osbourne reunion. That original lineup had performed at one 
of the first concerts he'd attended as a youngster in Birmingham. 
</P>
<P>
 And while Sabbath recorded its "Dehumanizer" album with Dio in 1992, Martin 
recorded a distinctly non-metal solo album called "Back Where I Belong" with 
Queen guitarist Brian May and such elements as a gospel choir and horns. The 
album was released on Polydor last year in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very English rock, Eric Clapton-type stuff," Martin said. "That's what 
happens when I sort of write by myself." 
</P>
<P>
 For all his metal history, Iommi considers himself a fan of everything from 
Frank Sinatra to the hardest of rock (although none of "that techno stuff"), as 
long it is played well. He survived a mid-'80s creative crisis that had him 
questioning the direction of his music, ironically at the height of that 
decade's metal explosion, to finally lead the band toward its third decade.

 "I've been through a lot of ground over the last 25 years, and you've just got 
to believe in what you do and stick to it," Iommi said. "Over the years, there 
have been record company people and management saying, 'Why don't you try a 
different sort of music?' In 1983, they tried to get us to make some singles. 
And we're not really a singles band. You can only write what you believe in. 
</P>
<P>
 "The band has always meant such a lot to me, and it's been a major part of my 
life. I put everything I can into the band. I enjoy it a lot more now. I take 
things a little lighter, but I'm still concerned with what we do. I'm really 
having a great time." WHERE AND WHEN

OUT OF AFRICA; BASSIST ARMAND SABAL- LECCO'S STAR HAS BEEN RISING SINCE LEAVING 
CAMEROON. HE'S WORKED WITH PAUL SIMON, AMONG OTHERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Zan Stewart writes regularly about jazz 
for The Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Armand Sabal-Lecco, the 28-year-old bassist and composer from Cameroon, has 
performed and recorded with Paul Simon, the Brecker Brothers, Herbie Hancock, 
Stanley Clarke, John Patitucci, Vanessa Williams and many others. 
</P>
<P>
 All this was never supposed to happen. 
</P>
<P>
 His father, Felix Sabal-Lecco, was once vice president of the Republic of 
Cameroon, on the western coast of Africa, and later its ambassador to France 
and Italy. He hoped his son would follow in his footsteps. "I was supposed to 
be a lawyer, a politician," Sabal-Lecco said. 
</P>
<P>
 But like his brothers Felix, a drummer, and Roger, a bassist, Sabal-Lecco was 
driven toward music and, at 13, switched from drums to bass. He also acted the 
madcap on skateboards all around Yaounde, the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was not the proper attitude for a diplomat's son, and he was sent to 
live with a sister in Paris when he was 15. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father felt that I had to leave, go where nobody would know me," he said 
with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Sabal-Lecco has thrived, becoming one of the music world's most 
in-demand bassists. He plays Saturday at La Ve Lee in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 Many people wrongly assume, Sabal-Lecco says, that he plays only African 
music. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm a guy who lives iA., who lived in France, who lived in Rome, who's from 
Cameroon, and who grew up playing funk, rock and straight-ahead jazz," said 
Sabal-Lecco, a tall, striking-looking man with a quick, winning smile. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started playing African music only after I moved to Paris. In Africa then, 
it wasn't hip to play African music. So my music is a mix of all those 
different things." 
</P>
<P>
 There's definitely a jazz core to the music that Sabal-Lecco plays at La Ve 
Lee, where his band includes such upper-echelon L. A. jazz journeymen as David 
Goldblatt on keyboards and Steve Tavaglione on saxes and electronic wind 
instrument. 
</P>
<P>
 The tunes, open and loose, are melodically diverse, variously underpinned by 
popping back beats and more fluid, African-based rhythmic patterns that allow 
plenty of room for soloing. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabal-Lecco, who avoids affixing labels to his music, calls this stuff 
"Leccology." 
</P>
<P>
 "Our band likes to play with the songs like Miles used to do at the beginning 
of the '80s," he said. "We have the frame, the shape of the song, but we play 
with it. It seems like we're as relaxed as in a jam, but everything is pretty 
set and written." 
</P>
<P>
 That relaxed attitude typifies Sabal-Lecco's approach to music in general. 
"I'm a formally self-taught musician, so how I learned music was from what I 
was feeling, not from what I was reading," he said. And those feelings 
determine the outcome of his performances, he added. 
</P>
<P>
 "How I play depends on who's playing with me, who's listening, the reaction of 
the crowd. And I want my band to play that way. Some musicians are so involved 
in how a tune has been written that there's no communication within the band on 
stage, and with the audience. I need musicians who can communicate." 
</P>
<P>
 Sabal-Lecco is succeeding, and his band sounds great, says Olivier Vabois, 
who, with owner Eddie Arbi, books La Ve Lee. "Armand's music is challenging, 
sometimes really difficult music, but it feels good," Vabois said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Paris in the late '80s, Sabal-Lecco had just finished a two-week tour with 
Xamahal, a band he and his brother Felix led, when destiny, in the form of Paul 
Simon, called -- many, many times. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew of Paul, but I'd never met him and, when I came home, he'd left a lot 
of messages" -- close to 100, the bassist said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabal-Lecco recalled thinking, "What is this? Maybe it was a friend of mine 
playing a joke." 
</P>
<P>
 So when Simon's manager called, asking him to come to New York for a session, 
he did what any of us would do with what we think is a crank caller -- he hung 
up. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, Sabal-Lecco called the New York number Simon had left on a 
message, reached the manager he had hung up on, apologized, and was hired to 
perform a number of tunes on Simon's then-upcoming, now classic album "Rhythm 
of the Saints." 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, Sabal-Lecco's star has been glowing. He's toured with Simon and 
Art Garfunkel. He's had his tunes recorded by fellow bassists Clarke and 
Patitucci, with whom he wrote "Another World," which was nominated for a 1993 
contemporary jazz instrumental performance Grammy. All this, and he's just 28. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's been a blessing to move here and make it," he said. "For a lot 
of people, it's very, very hard. I'm very fortunate." WHERE AND WHEN

 Law-and-order guys like Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren are proud of having guts -- and 
there his were, spilling gruesomely across a page of VideoGames magazine, whose 
February issue expressed its opinion of Lungren's campaign against violent and 
graphic video games by illustrating its open letter with a video image of 
Lungren, decapitated and fileted. 
</P>
<P>
 From Lungren's response (after finding out about the article from his 
10-year-old nephew): "Why not explore new ways to challenge, educate and 
entertain our youth rather than resorting to the cheap, mindless, misleading 
and dangerous thrill of video game violence."  
</P>
<P>
 Editor in Chief Chris Gore wrote: "It's a foregone conclusion that in 30 or 40 
years there will be someone in the White House who played video games. 
Hopefully, he or she will have honed his or her problem-solving skills from 
those challenging games."

 Amid urban fears of high crime, the 10 counties listed below recorded the

 Only 17% of 1,779 questionnaires were completed by selected Capitol reporters, 
lobbyists, staffers and legislators, rating the solons by intelligence, 
integrity, effectiveness, potential, energy, problem-solving and overall 
qualities.

<P>
 The publication admits right off that it's non-scientific, which is small 
consolation to last-place finishers Sen. Milton Marks (D-San Francisco) and 
Assemblyman Willard H. Murray Jr. (D-Paramount).

 Back-to-back 1992 and 1993 sweepstakes winners: Democrats Phillip Isenberg, 
the Sacramento assemblyman, and Sen. Pat Johnston of Stockton. Top-rated 
Republicans, both in fourth-place: Assembly leader Jim Brulte of Rancho 
Cucamonga and Sen. Marian Bergeson of Newport Beach. Bergeson was also the 
Senate's highest-rated woman; in the Assembly, Jackie Speier of Burlingame made 
that cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Of note: Democratic Assembly Speaker Willie Brown ranked high in everything 
but integrity, where he came in 74th, two ahead of recent felon Pat Nolan. And 
gubernatorial Democratic candidate Sen. Tom "No Retreat, No Surrender" Hayden 
ranked next to last in effectiveness.

 One is not enough: Until they absolutely, positively have to choose on the

two offices at once.

 Democratic Sen. David Roberti, facing a recall election April 12, is 
considering the state treasurer's job and District 4 of the State Board of 
Equalization. Ditto Democrat Gwen Moore for her own Los Angeles Assembly seat 
and secretary of state. Republican Dean Andal has a foot in his own Assembly 
race in Stockton and in Board of Equalization District 2. 
</P>
<P>
 Most spectacularly, Board of Equalization Chairman Brad Sherman, whose old 
district, like Gaul, was divided into three new ones, has declared his 
intentions in all three (one of them the same one Roberti has since cast his 
eyes upon) and for the state controller's job. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt I provided the political world with enough entertainment (opposing) 
the snack tax a few years ago and haven't done so since then," Sherman says, 
"so I thought filing for a record number of offices would do the trick." 
</P>
<P>
 All four will have until 5 p.m. on March 11 to weigh the odds and the 
opposition and then . . . take a Sherman on all but one campaign.

 Sweet Sue: Yet another memorably acronymed group: CALA, Citizens Against 
Lawsuit Abuse, hopes to educate people to what people probably already suspect, 
that "lawsuit abuse costs us jobs, raises the price of products and services 
like health care, and discourages companies from developing new products," says 
CALA Chairman Bill Bloomfield, who is not an attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Coincidence? CALA made its debut a mere fortnight after Los Angeles radio 
station KBIG settled a lawsuit by entertainer Barry Manilow, who took exception 
to the station's using his name without authorization in a "falsely 
disparaging" ad pointing out that KBIG does not play Manilow songs. Are you

CSUN BATTLES EARLY, SUCCUMBS LATE TO UCLA IN VOLLEYBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was early in the third game of Thursday night's Mountain Pacific Sports 
Federation men's volleyball match between Cal State Northridge and UCLA, yet 
one spectator had seen enough to predict that the Matadors were bound for a 
three-game loss. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA had come from behind to win the first two games, but after watching Kevin 
Wong and Jeff Nygaard execute a textbook double block of Jason Hughes' kill 
attempt to give the Bruins a four-point lead, the spectator turned to a friend 
and said, "This game is over, Bro." 
</P>
<P>
 It took another 15 minutes to make UCLA's 15-12, 17-15, 15-4 victory before 
1,016 official, but the match could have been called when the Bruins extended a 
6-2 lead in game three to 13-2 with Nygaard serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Nygaard, a 6-foot-8 junior All-American outside hitter, had three service aces 
during the run and three other serves that the Matadors had so much difficulty 
handling that they over-passed the ball to the net, leading to three easy kills 
-- and points -- for UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know if it's inexperience or what, but we played (poorly) from the 
start of game three," Northridge Coach John Price said. "It was a 0-0 score to 
start the third game, but these guys were either thinking too much about what 
might have been or getting down on themselves because we came so close to 
winning the second game, but they sure didn't play with any enthusiasm. I guess 
they decided they only wanted to play two games." 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA, the No. 1-ranked team in the nation, swept Northridge in last year's 
NCAA title match, but it looked as though the rematch might go four or five 
games as 11th-ranked Northridge held a 14-12 lead in game two before losing, 
17-15. 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA tied the score, 14-14, but Oliver Heitmann (30 kills, .659 hitting 
percentage) blasted a kill out of bounds off a UCLA block to give the Matadors 
a 15-14 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 The ensuing serve by Peter Piexoto was wide right, however, and UCLA got two 
points to take a 16-15 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 After a pair of sideouts, UCLA (11-1, 9-0 in conference matches) clinched the 
match when Wong blasted a ball that Piexoto couldn't handle. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong had 15 kills and 13 digs for the Bruins, who were led by Nygaard's 36 
kills, which equaled his career high. Nygaard had 17 kills in the first game 
alone. 
</P>
<P>
 Hughes had 15 kills for Northridge (7-5, 3-3). Collin Smith and Piexoto added 
11 and 10 kills for the Matadors. Piexoto also had 14 digs. 
</P>
<P>
 After falling behind, 5-0, in the first game, Northridge battled back to take 
a 12-11 lead, but UCLA scored the game's final four points to win, 15-12.

FOCUSED CALABASAS NOT BUFFALOED IN 4TH TRY AT FRONTIER OPPONENT

<P>
 When top-seeded Moorpark faces Calabasas today, it will mark the second year 
in a row the Southern Section Division V boys' soccer championship match will 
feature two Frontier League teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Santa Paula defeated the Coyotes in the title match, the third time 
since 1986 that Calabasas lost in the final to a Frontier opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 Calabasas Coach John Reich was asked if he felt any special sense of urgency 
to win this matchup at Gahr High. 
</P>
<P>
 "You mean I may be the Marv Levy of high school soccer coaches?" he said with 
a laugh, referring to the coach of the Buffalo Bills, three-time Super Bowl 
losers.  
</P>
<P>
 "No, the focus has been to play as well as we can. We are very comfortable 
that we can play with Moorpark." 
</P>
<P>
 The Musketeers (26-2-1) and the Coyotes (13-3-2) met twice this season.  
</P>
<P>
 Moorpark, the Frontier League champion, won the first meeting, 2-0, and the 
teams tied, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coyotes are led by senior defender Jeff Toms, senior forward Shayne 
Ferber, senior midfielder Bhret Haessig and junior goalkeeper Mike Freedman 
(eight shutouts). 
</P>
<P>
 Junior forward Pat Russo leads Moorpark with 28 goals. Senior forward Curtis 
Silverest has 19 goals, senior midfielder Brody Trejos has 18 and senior 
midfielder Paul Dojo has 14.

THE BIZ / ALAN CITRON: SOLO PRODUCERS MILCHAN, VAJNA HOPE TO TAKE SUCCESS 
PUBLIC 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN CITRON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In Hollywood circles, few independent producers command more respect than 
Arnon Milchan and Andy Vajna. Now they're poised to find out whether 
institutional investors feel the same way. 
</P>
<P>
 Both of the producers are in advanced discussions about taking their companies 
public, according to knowledgeable sources, who say Milchan and Vajna are 
looking to capitalize on the excitement generated on Wall Street by the 
$10-billion Paramount Communications takeover battle. 
</P>
<P>
 Milchan is said to have retained Goldman Sachs in New York to advance an 
offering in his Regency Enterprises, which is best known for hit movies such as 
"Under Seige" and "J.F.K." While Milchan declined to comment on the 
discussions, sources say he hopes to raise $100 million or more. 
</P>
<P>
 Vajna, a co-founder of Carolco Pictures who went on to produce "Tombstone" and 
"Medicine Man" through Cinergi, is said to be seeking substantially less than 
that. Sources say he has retained Los Angeles-based Seidler Cos. to go out with 
the offering as early as April or May. 
</P>
<P>
 The deals would give both producers a stronger financial footing as they move 
to expand their production slates. But Wall Street analysts say public 
offerings in small entertainment companies may remain a tricky proposition, 
since many people are still smarting from such 1980s-era failures as Weintraub 
Entertainment Group, Vestron and De Laurentiis. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would say that Wall Sreet is quite skeptical and that these deals will have 
a hard time being done," said one New York analyst who asked not to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics say new offerings may also be stalled by concerns that Hollywood is 
already producing too many movies, with Disney expanding its slate, MGM on the 
road to recovery, Viacom gearing up to run Paramount, cable mogul Ted Turner 
expanding his Hollywood operations and Savoy Pictures just coming into its own. 
</P>
<P>
 In the case of Milchan and Vajna, they're also known more as entrepreneurs 
than the kind of professional managers who put investors' minds at ease. But 
analysts say that may be offset by their impressive track records and the fact 
that both are aligned with major studios. 
</P>
<P>
 Milchan's Regency Enterprises is based at Warner Bros. and functions under a 
complex array of financing deals. Its latest investor is Australian media mogul 
Kerry Packer, who recently purchased a "significant" interest in Regency. 
</P>
<P>
 Milchan has said he wants to increase production from five to 15 pictures a 
year by 1995 -- which may be the best explanation for his interest in an 
offering. 
</P>
<P>
 Vajna, by comparison, is just getting Cinergi rolling. "Tombstone," which took 
in an impressive $52.8 million at the domestic box office, will be followed by 
"The Color of Night," a psychological thriller starring Bruce Willis, and 
"Renaissance Man," a comedy directed by Penny Marshall and starring Danny 
DeVito. 
</P>
<P>
 Disney has North American and Latin American distribution rights to Vajna's 
films through 1995, but Vajna controls the remainder of the world, financing 
much of his work through the same type of pre-sale agreements he helped devise 
at Carolco. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts say other entertainment company offerings will surely follow if 
Milchan's and Vajna's succeed. Several companies already have feelers out. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a scarcity value in these companies," said one analyst. "Plus, you 
have a whole new group of successful independent filmmakers out there." 
</P>

 A Frans-less festival: Frans Afman, a colorful figure on the film festival 
circuit, was said to be a no-show at the just-concluded American Film Market in 
Santa Monica. Organizers could not explain his absence and said it was the 
first time in memory he has not attended. 
</P>
<P>
 The affable Dutchman became known as the "banker to the stars" in the 1980s, 
when he oversaw hundreds of millions of dollars in loans to independent 
production companies as the entertainment czar for French bank Credit Lyonnais. 
Many of those companies later collapsed, and Afman left Credit Lyonnais in 
1991. He subsequently became a consultant to International Creative Management, 
but that relationship ended last year. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Cannes Film Festival last May, Afman said he had centralized his 
operations in Amsterdam and was actively lining up off-balance-sheet financing 
for films and TV shows. But industry sources say they've heard little of him 
since then.

 Little Big Horn revisited: European audiovisual commissioner Joao de Deus 
Pinheiro must have felt like Custer when he ventured into the American Film 
Market, just one week after calling for the dismantling of United International 
Pictures, one of Hollywood's biggest overseas distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Pinheiro, who was quoted as saying that he opposed an antitrust waiver 
extension for UIP, struck a more conciliatory tone in a series of meetings and 
appearances tied to AFM. But some worry that the commissioner will go back on 
the offensive when he returns to Europe, where anti-Hollywood sentiment remains 
strong among many filmmakers and exhibitors. 
</P>

 Stand-tall time: That's how some Paramount executives are referring to Monday 
morning, when Viacom Chairman Sumner Redstone and Chief Executive Frank Biondi 
will visit Paramount Pictures for the first time since winning the takeover 
battle for its parent company. The Redstone-Biondi wake-up call comes at 9 a.m.

PARENTING; PRESERVING CREATIVITY FOR THE AGES; CHILDREN'S SPECIAL ART PROJECTS 
ARE OFTEN CHERISHED. BUT PAPER CAN TEAR AND YELLOW, SO IT MAY BE WISE TO TAKE 
STEPS TO PROTECT THOSE WORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Sometimes a parent knows the minute the masterpiece is pulled out of a child's 
backpack that it is something to save for all time. Or a child's artwork may 
gradually become more dear after months of display on the front of the 
refrigerator. 
</P>
<P>
 As kids grow, parents begin to realize that special art projects may have 
almost an archival value years from now. But paper can yellow, tear and change 
over time, so conservationists strongly suggest that parents use care in their 
efforts to preserve meaningful remnants of childhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Christine Allen, archival sales and marketing manager for University Products 
Inc. in Holyoke, Mass., a firm that specializes in conservation materials, 
recommends that, whenever possible, parents give children fine quality, 
acid-free paper to draw on. Inexpensive paper of the type commonly used in 
schools contains a high acid content, which makes it more susceptible to 
yellowing and tearing, she said. Tacks, paper clips, tape and rubber bands also 
contribute to the rapid deterioration of artwork and should be avoided. 
</P>
<P>
 If a cherished project has been done on inexpensive paper, however, it can be 
sprayed, Allen suggested, with a de-acidification solution, such as Wei T'o, a 
nontoxic aerosol that helps preserve the paper and prevent discoloration. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally, a child will bring home a piece of art that marks a 
developmental turning point or an unexpected flash of talent. For those works 
that merit framing, Allen encourages the use of acid-free mounting board, and 
glass or acrylic that does not touch the artwork. To store several sheets of 
unframed artwork in a paper container, she recommends using an acid-free box 
and placing acid-free paper between the sheets.  
</P>
<P>
 "Don't be cheap when you're choosing a storage box," Allen said. Flat 
acid-free corrugated storage boxes cost about $6 each through archival material 
distributors. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob McGiffin, chief conservator at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum in 
Los Angeles, suggested that parents also consider properly protecting some of 
their children's clay sculptures. While clay is an inert material that will not 
be changed by heat or light, it is, of course, breakable, a fact brought home 
to many during the Northridge earthquake. To prevent artwork made of clay from 
falling and shattering, McGiffin recommends using a special museum wax -- a 
blend of microcrystalline wax and mineral spirits -- to attach the art to a 
surface such as a mantel or shelf. 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Adams, co-owner of Conservation Materials in Sparks, Nev., said the 
wax, used by museums internationally, will not harm or alter any surface, and 
it can be easily loosened and removed with a string of dental floss. 
</P>
<P>
 For storing clay pieces, Allen recommends acid-free collection boxes with 
individual compartments that protect against breakage and discoloration. 
</P>
<P>
 Joan Rapoport of Van Nuys, an artist and mother of two daughters now in 
college, still has a crayon drawing on the refrigerator that one daughter did 
10 years ago. She tried to save a couple of art projects every year for each 
child, and then re-evaluated the growing stack of drawings and paintings from 
time to time to see what still seemed worth keeping.  
</P>
<P>
 Rapoport understands the value of saving children's art for those to follow. 
Her daughters especially treasure a framed picture of a lute that she painted 
back in high school, and a drawing she made on a Mother's Day card almost half 
a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've gotten a kick out of the art my mother saved," she said.

PARENTING; TOPPING THE 'PAGE-TURNERS'; * CHILDREN'S BOOKSTORE OWNERS OFFER 
ADVICE ON COMPILING A READING LIST FOR YOUNG MINDS.

 Coaxing children to read more is often a matter of putting the right books in 
their hands. But while parents will remember beloved titles from their past, 
they may need help navigating today's juvenile market. Children's bookstore 
owners who review thousands of books each year are ideal sources for advice on 
what to buy. Not only will they happily recommend their own favorites, but they 
can also tailor a reading list to the age and interests of a particular child. 
</P>
<P>
 A survey of owners of four Valley children's bookstores yielded the following 
selections, all newly released. 
</P>
<P>
 For the under-3 crowd, Judy Collins, co-owner of Creative Play Resources in 
Northridge, chooses "The Little City" and "The Little Country" board books 
(Random House, hardcover, $3.25 each). Written by Katherine Ross and 
illustrated by Edward Miller, the books capture the excitement of city life and 
the beauty of the country. Among the scenes depicted are a morning rush hour 
and night city panoramas as well as children catching bugs and feeding ponies. 
"These books convey wonderful, first-time experiences for children," Collins 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 For the same age group, Bernice Anikstein, owner of Educative Toys and 
Supplies in Van Nuys, recommends "Baby Monkey" (Viking, hardcover, $3.99). 
Written and illustrated by Patrick Yee, this board book features a young monkey 
who is saved by its mother from various mishaps. According to Anikstein, "It 
helps little kids understand that mom is always there to offer security and 
guidance."  
</P>
<P>
 Darlene Daniel, owner of Pages Books in Tarzana, suggests "What Is Your 
Language?" (Dutton Books, hardcover, $12.99) for youngsters from ages 2 to 6. 
Author Debra Leventhal and illustrator Monica Wellington created this picture 
book about a boy who visits many countries, asking questions of children he 
meets. "The book graphically shows the similarities and differences of children 
around the world," Daniel says. 
</P>
<P>
 For a similar crowd, ages 3 and older, Christy Meisner, who owns the Secret 
Garden in Burbank, likes "My Working Mom" (Morrow Junior Books, hardcover, 
$14.95). Written by Peter Glassman with illustrations by Tedd Arnold, the story 
focuses on a mom who works in a scientific laboratory, creating experiments 
"that keep her whole family jumping," according to the book's promotional 
material. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel recommends "Max Found Two Sticks" (Simon and Schuster, hardcover, $15) 
for the 3-8 set. Written and illustrated by Brian Pinkney, the story centers on 
a boy who uses a pair of sticks to mimic the sounds of life around him: the 
noise of the subway, pigeons flying, insects buzzing. 
</P>
<P>
 Anikstein's choice for the same age group is "Too Many Babas" (Harper/Trophy, 
paperback, $3.50), with text and illustrations by Carolyn Croll. When a crowd 
of grandmothers attempts to make a pot of stew, they learn a lesson about 
teamwork, Anikstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 Older children, Anikstein feels, will appreciate "What Good is a Tail?" 
(Cobblehill/Dutton, hardcover, $13.99). Writer Dorothy Hinshaw Patent and 
photographer William Munoz got together on this book for 8- to 12-year-olds, 
which highlights the many uses of animals' tails. "It's great for kids who are 
having trouble reading because the print is large and non-threatening," 
Anikstein says. 
</P>
<P>
 Also for this group, she suggests "My Escape: Shipwrecked" (Pocket Books, 
paperback, $2.99) by Judy Donnelly and Sydelle Kramer. "The book has a great 
historical base and includes all the right elements for a good page-turner," 
says Anikstein of this true story about a mother and her children lost at sea 
during World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 From Daniel, another "page-turner" pick, for 8- to 14-year-olds, is "Song of 
the Gargoyle" by Zilpha Keatley Snyder (Bantam Books, paperback, $3.99). The 
story of a medieval boy's quest to determine why his father has disappeared, 
the book, Daniel says, is loaded with adventure. 
</P>
<P>
 Along similar lines, Collins recommends "Martin, the Warrior," by Brian 
Jacques with illustrations by Gary Chalk (Philomel, hardcover, $17.95). 
</P>
<P>
 Set in a mythical medieval country, this good vs. evil adventure for 10- to 
14-year-olds reveals how Martin the mouse warrior earned his title and fame. 
</P>
<P>
 The same readers, Meisner says, might also go for "Bruce Coville's Book of 
Aliens: Tales to Warp Your Mind" (Scholastic, paperback, $2.95), an anthology 
of scary stories compiled by Coville, who also wrote most of them. "Kids love 
scary books," Meisner maintains. 
</P>
<P>
 "My son just finished one that he couldn't put down. He read it in two nights 
-- that's two nights without TV. I was happy."

PARENTING; THEIR ACTION IS THE ATTRACTION; * MIGHTY MORPHIN POWER RANGERS MAY 
BE SHALLOW, BUT KIDS LOVE THEM. ADULTS ARE BEWILDERED.

<P>
 In case you've been visiting Mars lately, there's a raging new fad among the 
elementary school set. It's the Fox Net work TV show "Mighty Mor phin Power 
Rangers," about a group of teen-agers who turn into karate-chopping 
super-athletes when provoked, then morph into big mechanical monsters ("zords") 
to finish off their enemies.  
</P>
<P>
 The show spawned a feeding frenzy for Power Rangers dolls that reached a 
crescendo before Christmas. Stories circulated about parents driving all night 
and crossing state lines to get the colorful figurines. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month a Power Rangers personal appearance at Universal Studios caused a 
ruckus. Parents and kids clamored to get to the show, turning the Hollywood 
Freeway into a parking lot extending to downtown. Police finally had to close 
off freeway exits in an effort to control the record crowds. 
</P>
<P>
 What's going on? What could possibly be so great about Power Rangers? 
</P>
<P>
 As the mother of a Power Rangers aficionado, I confess total bewilderment. And 
I'm not alone.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything new or unique about the show," says Gretchen Garrett of 
Van Nuys, whose son Timmy tries to rearrange family activities around "Power 
Rangers" episodes. "It's stylized, like the old Batman TV show. It's got 
karate, but so do Ninja Turtles and lots of other shows." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike some shows, however, "Power Rangers" avoids realistic blood and guts, 
which pleases Char DeMott of Studio City. "I also like the way each show 
focuses on a positive theme -- say teamwork or tenacity," she says, "and 
illustrates it through the plot." 
</P>
<P>
 The characters are so shallow, they'd fit in a petri dish. But who cares? 
Certainly not kids. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst thing you can say about "Power Rangers" is that it's formulaic. My 
main complaint is that it has temporarily replaced "Roundhouse" (Nickelodeon's 
bright, satirical revue) in my daughter's affections. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Others have more strenuous objections. 
</P>
<P>
 A whole school of thought in child psychology says all shows that teach 
aggression as the solution to problems increase aggression in society at large. 
But psychologist Kathleen Welch of the Juvenile Offense Program at the San 
Fernando Valley Child Guidance Clinic disagrees. 
</P>
<P>
 "If your child's already aggressive and acting out, you might want to limit 
their viewing of TV shows that feature violence," she says. "But you should 
also be taking more positive steps. Those kids need to learn more pro-social 
ways of dealing with anger. Just limiting their exposure to violence isn't 
going to teach them new skills." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Herbert Blaufarb, who oversees outpatient treatment services at the 
clinic, agrees. "The real sources of aggression in children are genetic and 
environmental," he says. "When I get a child in here who's acting out 
aggressively, I look first to the family environment. Next I look at his or her 
personality since birth. Some people are simply born with more aggressive 
personalities." 
</P>
<P>
 Viewing habits and exposure to violent movies or TV shows are, in Blaufarb's 
opinion, negligible factors in the development of violent habits in children. 
</P>
<P>
 "I question how much influence the media have at all, not just negatively but 
positively," Blaufarb said. "For instance, the theory that these shows provide 
'super-heroes' who help kids work out their fantasies of power and relieve 
feelings of persecution. I don't think it's as important as it's been made out 
to be." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 How does this theory about the media's impact on psychosocial development hold 
up against more lurid fare such as "Mortal Kombat" (the graphically violent 
video game) and "Night Trap" (the computer game so vicious that Toys 'R' Us 
removed it from its shelves)? 
</P>
<P>
 "Again," Blaufarb said, "to parents worried about the effects of these games, 
I would say, 'Look at how you've reared your child before he or she got to play 
these games. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you haven't been asleep at the wheel and you've set appropriate guidelines 
for social conduct, you don't have to be concerned about the child using his 
aggressive impulses destructively.' " 
</P>
<P>
 If your child is starting to show aggressive tendencies, Blaufarb advises, 
"Ask yourself what you can do to help them use those aggressions productively. 
Aggression isn't bad per se. Civilized people just use it appropriately." 
</P>
<P>
 Ken Nagayama, owner of a martial arts studio in Burbank, suggests one strategy 
for handling aggression. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've had success using karate to lower aggression in angry children," he 
said. "We teach control, so that when our students kick they use their anger, 
but in a controlled fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 "The anger is expressed, but no one is hurt."

PARENTING; FITNESS FOR YOUNGSTERS; * REGULAR EXERCISE IS VITAL FOR THE GOOD 
PHYSICAL AND MENTAL HEALTH OF CHILDREN.

<P>
 Even in sunny Southern California, the weather outside can be frightful. 
</P>
<P>
 And with those some times rainy winter months still ahead, parents will need 
to find ways to keep kids busy when they're stuck inside and whining, "I'm 
BORRRED!" and bouncing off the walls. Or worse, when they are vegging in front 
of the TV. 
</P>
<P>
 There is another option. Kids can expend their energy and keep fit (and you 
can stay sane) even during the worst weather. Several Valley gyms cater to 
children, offering everything from basketball to ballet. Kids can learn modern, 
jazz, hip-hop and tap dances; practice cheerleading, gymnastics and aerobics; 
master judo and karate; swim laps; or play with Frisbees, jump ropes or on 
trampolines. 
</P>
<P>
 And since it's all indoors, they'll stay warm and dry while they work out 
(unless they're in the pool, that is). 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids need to move around," said Karen Lynn O'Brien, wellness director of the 
Mid-Valley YMCA in Van Nuys and mother of 5-year-old triplets. "Especially now 
that a lot of schools are cutting out PE, this is where children learn to take 
care of their bodies. I take my triplets here and have them do everything." 
</P>
<P>
 During inclement weather, Calabasas parent Penny Erickson, a pediatric 
occupational therapist, encourages daughter Lindsay, 4, to jump rope in the 
house and play on an indoor hopscotch mat. She has also enrolled her child in a 
local gym. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lindsay had all this endless energy that wasn't being focused," Erickson 
said. "But since joining the gym, she learned to focus and work as a team 
player. She's developed self-confidence, and she feels good about what she is 
doing. And when she gets her exercise, she sleeps better at night." 
</P>
<P>
 But little Lindsay is in the minority when it comes to working out. Studies 
show that most youngsters do not get enough exercise. Less than half of the 
nation's children participate in 20 minutes of vigorous activity three times a 
week -- the minimum required to maintain adequate fitness. 
</P>
<P>
 Year-round physical exertion is important, even for very young children, 
according to Encino pediatrician Pejman Salimpour. "The sooner children get 
started with physical activity, the better," he said. "People who are active 
are more energetic, full of life and happier, and there are health risks in 
having a sedentary lifestyle." 
</P>
<P>
 Benefits of exercise extend beyond the playing court to the classroom and 
home, said preschool gymnastics specialist Connie Thornbury, an instructor at 
Junior Elite Training Center in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 But Salimpour cautions parents: "Young children should do what they are 
physically capable of doing, but they should not be pushed into it because they 
will resent it, they will learn to hate physical activity and exercises." WHERE

PARENTING; FINDING THE RIGHT FIT; * EXPERTS ADVISE VISITING SCHOOLS TO 
DETERMINE IF THE TEACHING PHILOSOPHY MATCHES YOUR CHILD'S STYLE OF LEARNING.

 Five-year-old Garrett Edell wanted to learn to read and write, but academic 
subjects were not stressed at the private school he attended. So his parents 
transferred him to a nearby public school, where he studies the three Rs in his 
kindergarten class. He even has homework. 
</P>
<P>
 "Garrett's brain is ready to be a sponge," said his mother, Elaine Edell of 
Sherman Oaks, "and I wanted him in a learning environment. We felt the public 
school is more scholastically inclined than the private school." 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Gayla Kraetsch-Hartsough, also of Sherman Oaks, is trying to decide 
which kindergarten her son Jeff should attend in the fall. Unlike the Edells, 
Kraetsch-Hartsough is more interested in a school's TLC than its didactic 
methods. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know Jeff will learn regardless of how the school teaches reading," she 
said. "I am more concerned that he be in a nurturing environment that makes 
every child feel special." 
</P>
<P>
 Edell and Kraetsch-Hartsough may seek different kindergarten experiences for 
their offspring, but they both want their children to attend a school that 
meets their social, educational and emotional needs. With a wide array of 
public, private and parochial schools in and around the San Fernando Valley, 
parents who are willing to devote time to the search can usually pinpoint a 
facility that will be a good match for their child. 
</P>
<P>
 But does it really matter? After all, we are talking about kindergartners -- 
not college-bound scholars. Is there anything wrong with sending a youngster to 
the neighborhood school? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In many cases, the answer to both questions is "no," according to Cal State 
Northridge education professor Susan A. Wasserman. 
</P>
<P>
 "Almost any child can do well in any well-run school that has the interests of 
children as its focal point -- as most schools do," she said. "I don't think 
there is just one school for each child, and to try to find the perfect match 
may be a utopia. The best school for your child may very well be just around 
the corner where he can be with his neighborhood friends." 
</P>
<P>
 But Chris Holabird, director of Los Encinos, a private elementary school, 
notes that some children perform better in a setting that caters to their 
needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some kids can go to any school in town and do just fine," he said. "But 
equally talented kids may have a particular learning style. For example, some 
kids thrive on pressure; other kids don't perform as well under pressure, 
especially in the formative learning years. 
</P>
<P>
 "To get off to a good start, it is very important that kids feel successful. 
If everyone in a class moves at the same speed -- and it turns out not to be 
the child's pace -- it can do a lot of damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Prof. Adele Gottfried, who chairs the educational psychology department at 
CSUN, suggests that parents find out how schools deal with students' individual 
strengths and weaknesses. "Every child has peaks and valleys," she said. "If 
your child is able in certain areas, look for a school that emphasizes those 
skills or talents. If your child has special needs, ask how the school will 
accommodate them." 
</P>
<P>
 Gottfried adds that schools should have a low student-teacher ratio, a solid 
academic program that includes a variety of subjects such as art, music and 
physical education, and a broad range of extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is very important that children learn to love learning," she said. 
"Schools should provide everything to develop the child. There should be 
opportunities for creativity throughout all grade levels. Children are happier 
if attention is paid to their emotional life and artistic side." 
</P>
<P>
 Cost is, of course, also a factor in school selection. Tuition as high as 
$10,000 a year or more is not uncommon at some private institutions. 
</P>
<P>
 Edell, who is pleased with her son's public school progress, believes that you 
don't always get what you pay for. "The facilities might be nicer or newer, but 
that doesn't mean your child will learn any more or less." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, it's always nice when schools are equipped with fancy computer labs 
or new athletic facilities, but such amenities should not sway a parent's 
decision, according to Wasserman. 
</P>
<P>
 "The priority should not be on things, but on the people within the school, 
their philosophy and how they operate," she said. "Is it a 
sit-down-and-be-quiet school, or is it a hands-on school where children have 
room to grow and develop?"  
</P>
<P>
 The task of assessing public schools is made easier with "report cards" 
(called School Accountability Reports) that rate each facility's performance in 
areas including student achievement, class size, safety, services, counseling 
and attendance. The reports, mandated since 1990 under voter-approved 
Proposition 98, are available at all California public schools. 
</P>
<P>
 But the only way to be sure that a school is right for your child is to spend 
time there, according to Holabird. 
</P>
<P>
 "Brochures have a way of all sounding alike," he said. "They all claim to be a 
nurturing place that promotes self-esteem. But one school's way of translating 
that goal into action may be quite different from another school's. It is 
essential that parents visit the school and the classrooms and use their own 
best judgment." HOW TO CHOOSE A SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 1. Start early. Begin your search up to two years in advance. Many schools 
have already closed off applications for fall. 
</P>
<P>
 2. Compile a list of likely choices. Talk to parents for firsthand information 
about the pros and cons of individual facilities. Preschool directors are 
another good referral source. 
</P>
<P>
 3. Attend school events. Most schools offer open houses, tours and 
orientations to parents of prospective students. Such events help familiarize 
you with the campus and staff. 
</P>
<P>
 4. Make an appointment to visit the school while it is in session to observe 
classrooms, chat with teachers and meet with principals. It's a good idea to 
stop in several classrooms throughout the grades. 
</P>
<P>
 5. Introduce your child to the school. After you have narrowed your choices, 
bring your child to the school to see his or her reaction to the playground and 
classrooms. PICK A SCHOOL, ANY SCHOOL 
</P>
<P>
 So you want your child to attend public school. Now you have another decision 
to make. Which school? 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to two new state laws, parents can enjoy greater choice than ever 
before in selecting a public school for their child. By July 1, students -- no 
matter where they live -- may enroll in any school within their district. 
Assembly Bill 1114, also known as the "open enrollment law," specifies that: 
</P>
<P>
 Schools that receive more requests for admission than they have room for must 
select students at random -- not according to academic or athletic ability. 
</P>
<P>
 School districts have the authority to continue to maintain racial and ethnic 
balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who now live in the attendance area of a particular school will not 
be displaced by those transferring from other areas. 
</P>
<P>
 But your choices don't end at the district's borders. A related 
"inter-district choice" law (Assembly Bill 19) allows -- but does not require 
-- school districts to accept a limited number of students from other districts 
as part of a five-year pilot program. 
</P>
<P>
 Students wishing to transfer to public schools in other districts must apply 
before Jan. 1 of the preceding school year. MARYANN HAMMERS

PARENTING; WHEN THE 1ST BELL RINGS; * EMOTIONAL AND ACADEMIC DEVELOPMENT SHOULD 
DETERMINE WHEN TO ENROLL A CHILD IN KINDERGARTEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARBARA BRONSON GRAY, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES; Barbara Bronson Gray writes 
regularly for The Times.

<TEXT>
<P>
 For parents of children born in the kindergarten cut-off season -- from late 
August to December, depending on the school -- deciding whether to start them 
in elementary school or wait a year can be tough. Are youngsters better off 
being the oldest or the youngest in their class? Is intellectual readiness 
enough, or must a child demonstrate a certain degree of emotional maturity as 
well? 
</P>
<P>
 Children who have already spent two or more years in preschool may seem ready 
for a change, but an academically oriented kindergarten can be quite a leap. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a very individual issue and depends a lot on the child's development," 
said Judy Jacobsen, director of the Westminster Presbyterian Preschool in 
Westlake Village. 
</P>
<P>
 One place for parents to start, of course, is with the school of their choice. 
If it's a public school, the state Education Code is clear about cut-offs, said 
Susan Thompson, an administrator with the California Department of Education's 
child development division in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 To begin kindergarten, children must be 4 years and 9 months old by Sept. 1, 
or 5 years old by Dec. 1, although a little-known provision of state law allows 
districts to admit students with slightly later birthdays as soon as they turn 
5. 
</P>
<P>
 Private schools differ in their cut-off dates, but generally suggest that 
kindergartners be 5 by Oct. 1. 
</P>
<P>
 Even going by the dates may not help much, however, according to Elizabeth 
Crane, professor of educational psychology and counseling at Cal State 
Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Crane maintains that the cut-offs have no basis in specific educational 
research or recommendations. "All it amounts to is that some administrator 
somewhere has put an arbitrary date down," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such entry dates differ widely, she added. In other countries, such as 
England, children are simply admitted when they turn 5, even if this means 
having them begin school in the middle of the academic year. 
</P>
<P>
 As any parent can testify, there's a wide divergence among the maturity levels 
of 5-year-olds. So moms and dads should consider their child and the various 
kindergarten programs carefully before making a decision. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past decade, theories about what kindergarten should be have changed 
drastically. Thompson said that in 1987, the state's school readiness task 
force concluded that public school kindergarten was becoming too academic and 
that some children were being left behind. As a result, in 1988, the Department 
of Education published a booklet, "Here They Come: Ready or Not!" (California 
State Department of Education, 1988, $5.50), encouraging what educators call 
developmentally appropriate curricula. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bottom line is that kindergartens have to be ready for the child, and 
receptive to the fact that children are going to be at all different 
developmental levels," Thompson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because not all schools -- especially private schools -- agree with this 
philosophy, the key, experts say, is to visit the class to make certain the 
teacher will gear the curriculum and the pace to the individual child. 
</P>
<P>
 This has become more important in recent years, according to Jacobsen, because 
more parents have been choosing to hold their children back. The result is that 
a kindergarten class can fill up with a broad range of ages, including many 
older students, which can put a much younger child at a disadvantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Marlene Frantz of Topanga Canyon decided to enroll her October-born son, 
Kieffer, as soon as he was eligible. She has sometimes been frustrated seeing 
how children who were held back affect the class. "Bored, huge egos, advanced 
skills on the playground -- these can be problems for the others," she said. 
Kieffer, however, has done well. In Frantz's view, "holding him back a year 
would have been a sentence for boredom." 
</P>
<P>
 At Valley Beth Shalom, which has an academically oriented kindergarten, the 
biggest challenge, headmaster Steve Bogad said, is having to coach resistant 
parents to hold a child back. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's lots of ego involved," he said. "But I think a child belongs where he 
or she belongs. If a child is born in August and yet is developmentally ready, 
don't leave him out. It works both ways." 
</P>
<P>
 Crane conceded that the downside of a bad decision is daunting. "To be pushed 
into a situation of experiencing inferiority or incompetency can have a 
long-term effect," she said. Yet to be bored with the basics can create other 
problems.

PARENTING; THE QUESTION OF GOD; * CHILDREN'S WONDERMENT CAN POSE A DILEMMA FOR 
THOSE WHO AREN'T RELIGIOUS OR WHOSE FAMILIES COMBINE BELIEFS.

<P>
 Sandy was sitting in a crowded McDonald's restaurant when her 5-year-old son 
asked in a booming voice, "So who was this Jesus Christ guy anyway?" 
</P>
<P>
 In the hush that followed, Sandy -- who asked that her real name not be used 
-- replied: "He was a man who lived a long time ago, a kind of teacher. People 
who call themselves Christians believe in what he taught." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the answer satisfied the boy briefly, other questions quickly 
followed: What are Christians? How are they different from other people? What 
are we? 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner or later, whether their parents are prepared or not, children begin 
asking about God. They do it, according to Rabbi Steve Tucker of Temple Ramat 
Zion in Northridge, because it gives them a feeling of belonging and "a sense 
of a larger community." 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids want to know, who am I in the world?" Tucker said. "Religion helps the 
child process the world and provides the community, which the parent alone 
can't provide. That's extremely important." 
</P>
<P>
 Important or not, it can pose a dilemma for parents who either aren't 
particularly religious or whose marriage combines two different traditions of 
belief. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Sandy, who grew up in a non-religious home, is nevertheless reluctant to 
deprive her son of the comforts of faith. "Although I don't believe in God or 
organized religion," she explained, "I wanted to give him information in case 
that is what he wanted to believe." 
</P>
<P>
 Eric Mason, youth pastor for East Whittier Friends Church (a Quaker group), 
says he thinks that it's important for children to believe in something. The 
alternative, he says, is that "they'll believe in anything," good or bad, that 
comes along. In his words, "there's an empty space inside that longs to be 
filled." 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Spence of North Hills reports that going to church not only brings her 
family together, but also gives her children more security, especially in times 
of stress such as the aftermath of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The feeling extends to the grown-up Spences too, she says. She cites an injury 
her son suffered as the event that made a churchgoer of her husband: "He 
realized he can't always protect his children and started going because he felt 
maybe God could help protect them." 
</P>
<P>
 Even adults who aren't observant can bring an element of religion into family 
life. Anyone "can be religious without believing in a deity," said Father Allen 
DeLong, president of Chaminade College Preparatory, a Catholic school in 
Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Julie Price, a Studio City mother of two, agrees, adding that without benefit 
of institutional guidance, "I taught (my children) to be good to others, to be 
kind and honest, to give to charity." 
</P>
<P>
 Some clerics, however, believe that such messages may be more powerful when 
presented in the context of faith. 
</P>
<P>
 "Religion teaches absolute morality," said Tucker, "that you don't cheat, not 
because you might be caught, but because it is wrong, period." 
</P>
<P>
 While that may sound gratifyingly simple, parents often find it far from 
simple to talk to children about God. Tucker offers his own answer to a young 
one's question, Who is God?: "I tell them God is a force that we can't see but 
we know its effects, like the wind. God is what makes mommies love daddies, 
parents love children. How did you know to love your dog? No one taught you; 
you just do." 
</P>
<P>
 Religious leaders agree that in marriages of mixed faiths, problems arise not 
only over concepts of God, but over the rituals of faith. DeLong advises 
parents to discuss ahead of time how they plan to raise their children and 
avoid making faith an arena of conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob and Barbara Tarlau of Northridge resolved the issue before they even got 
married. Bob, who is Jewish, told Barbara, who is Catholic, that since her 
faith was stronger than his, she could be in charge of their future progeny's 
religious upbringing. Said Barbara, now the mother of a 4-year-old son: "We 
both felt it was important to have the moral guidance that religion provides." 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever choice parents make, DeLong maintains, if they attend services, their 
youngsters should go along. Sure, they'd rather play than go to Sunday school, 
he says. They'd rather play than do their homework or clean their rooms, too. 
"But these are part of the responsibilities of parenting. This is part of 
bringing a child to maturity." 
</P>
<P>
 The message to convey, Tucker said, is that "this is just something this 
family does; this is part of who we are. It brings meaning to our family." 
</P>
<P>
 DeLong admits that many services are boring, and said the onus is on clergy to 
"make it appealing . . . to win their hearts." 
</P>
<P>
 The bottom line, though, says Mason, is that whatever rituals you follow, you 
can't force a child to believe in something. If they don't believe, he advised, 
"you just love them anyway."

PARENTING; RADIO DRAMAS TUNED TO KIDS; * A FATHER AND DAUGHTER CREATE A 
30-MINUTE CASSETTE THAT LETS YOUNGSTERS READ ALONG WITH THE SCRIPT AND JOIN IN 
THE ACTION.

 "Close your eyes and picture a fluffy teddy bear named Honey," the woman tells 
the youngsters gathered at her feet. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do you see it? Can you imagine it?"  
</P>
<P>
 A dozen heads, eyes covered with little hands, bob up and down.  
</P>
<P>
 "What does he look like? Look, there's a clown and a jack-in-the-box . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 The scene is Creative Play Resources, a Northridge toy store and children's 
bookshop, and the woman, dressed as a green grasshopper, is Tammy Glenn. Before 
an awe-struck group of little ones, Glenn and her father, Sam, are performing 
excerpts from an old-fashioned radio drama they created last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Aimed at getting children excited about reading, Radio Drama for Kids is a 
30-minute cassette that allows youngsters to read along with the script and 
join in the action. When the Glenns perform it live -- as they do periodically 
in area bookstores and libraries -- they sing, finger a keyboard and play parts 
of their tape, all of which is just a little more dramatic than the experience 
of the tape alone. 
</P>
<P>
 And unlike traditional storybook tapes, which are usually narrated by a single 
voice, the Glenns' radio drama features antic sound effects, sing-along songs 
and characters who talk to each other. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a fun way for children to listen to a story," says Tammy, 27, a graphic 
designer with a journalism degree from Cal State Northridge. "The idea is to 
encourage kids to use their imaginations and to read." 
</P>
<P>
 Children are accustomed to having stories read to them, she says, but with the 
added effects of radio drama, "there's so much more going on. When I close my 
eyes, I can visualize all these characters dancing around and talking to each 
other. I can see doors opening and closing, cash registers jingling. It's all 
made up in my head."  
</P>
<P>
 For her father, Sam, 57, radio drama was a big part of childhood. Saturday 
mornings, he recalls, would find him "by that radio without fail," listening to 
a show called "Let's Pretend," which dramatized stories and fairy tales. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The genesis of Radio Drama for Kids goes back 25 years to when Sam and his 
wife, Cathy, who died in 1992, began making up bedtime stories for little 
Tammy. Cathy wrote the stories and Sam, a former L.A. studio musician, wrote 
music to go with them. The couple eventually turned these tales into 
Storybook-in-a-Box, a do-it-yourself project in which children use stickers to 
illustrate pre-printed stories, color the background and put pages together to 
create their own book. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, wanting to incorporate Sam's music into the project, Sam and his 
daughter added sound to the storybook and created Radio Drama for Kids. The aim 
of both projects, he Glenns say, is not only to entice children to read, but to 
make them part of the creative process. To date, they have completed four books 
(each available in a preschool version and one for children 6 and older) and 
one cassette. More are in the works. 
</P>
<P>
 In the radio drama, Tammy, who as a child performed in commercials and once 
sang with Bernadette Peters on a TV special, does the voices of several 
characters, while Sam, a.k.a. "Daddy Jazz," provides music and sound effects. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Peters, who owns Creative Play Resources with a partner, likes the 
creativity of Radio Drama for Kids because "you have to use a bit more 
imagination and can interact a little more. You have to fill in the picture. 
Children still like to pretend." 
</P>
<P>
 During the Saturday story session at Peters' store, youngsters sit attentively 
while Tammy -- dressed in green shoes, green tights, green skirt and a green 
and yellow vest -- introduces some of the characters: Ka Ba Zoo the camel 
(Brenda Kraniak) and Honey and Mrs. Pinchnose (Greg Thompson). 
</P>
<P>
 Sam concedes he got a kick watching children "hear" his drama. "When you see 
some kids really enjoying your project and being really intent," he says with a 
grin, "that's the greatest thing." WHERE TO GO

BARGAINS / GERI COOK: FEEDING WEDDING GUESTS FOR LESS; KAY'S GOURMET CATERING 
IN WESTLAKE VILLAGE OFFERS BUDGET DEALS ON FOOD AND SUPPLIES FOR RECEPTIONS. 
</P>

<P>
 If you've been checking around and discovered that it's going to cost a lot 
more than the $25 or so you expected to feed one guest at a wedding reception, 
you're not alone. This is the most expensive item in wedding planning -- and 
the one that often causes the most difficulty. 
</P>
<P>
 Kay's Gourmet Catering has a budget wedding package that comes in at $15.95 
per person, plus $100 for the chef, who prepares the pasta on site to guests' 
requests. There is a 25-person minimum. 
</P>
<P>
 You can choose two out of three fancy displays, either fancy fruit with melon 
carvings, fancy vegetables with sculpted flowers and dip or a fancy cheese 
display. 
</P>
<P>
 For appetizers, you can choose six from more than 240 hors d'oeuvres. One 
sample menu could include teriyaki beef, sesame chicken with honey dip, 
mini-quiche (Lorraine, spinach or seafood), crab-stuffed mushrooms, sweet and 
sour meatballs, and shrimp and avocado ka-bobs. 
</P>
<P>
 A pasta bar offers two pastas, Alfredo and marinara, with a choice of 
broccoli, green onions, sliced mushrooms, zucchini, garlic, grated cheese, and 
shrimp, clams or chicken. This is where the chef makes each guest's pasta to 
order. 
</P>
<P>
 Caesar salad and garlic bread can be added for $1.95 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 If you need to be even more budget-conscious, there's the wedding sandwich 
buffet for $12.50 per person. You get a choice of two hot hors d'oeuvres, 
petite rolls filled with roast beef, chicken salad and ham, and topped with 
lettuce, tomato and mayonnaise. For salad, there's a choice of potato, pasta or 
macaroni salad, coleslaw, tossed green salad or a swan-shaped pineapple cream 
cheese mold, plus a fancy veggie and relish display with ranch dip. Coffee, 
including decaf, and tea are included. 
</P>
<P>
 Both packages come with a wedding cake in your choice of 12 flavors and 
fillings, but all wedding packages may be purchased without the cake at 50 
cents less per person. You always get fruit punch, nuts, coffee or tea, buffet 
tables, silver candelabra with candles, silver punch bowl and ladle, paper 
goods ($1 per person charge for china) and tablecloths for serving tables. Plan 
on two uniformed servers -- at $125 apiece -- if you use paper goods, four for 
china. 
</P>
<P>
 I have used Kay's Gourmet Catering on many occasions and have been very 
pleased. At several culinary events I have attended, the longest lines always 
seem to be at Kay's booth. Kay Corning, founder and owner, was recently elected 
vice president of the Western region of the Culinary Federation of America, 
which means that next year she will become the group's first woman president.

LET THEM EAT CAKE; CO-OWNED BY SOPHISTICATED DUO MITCHELL AND SUSAN FRIEDER, 
THE LANCASTER EATERY IS PROBABLY ANTELOPE VALLEY'S BEST RESTAURANT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 People are eating better and better these days in the Antelope Valley, in no 
small part due to Mitchell and Susan Frieder, co-owners of Downtown Cakes and 
Company. 
</P>
<P>
 Chef Mitchell once cooked with Ken Frank at Hollywood's much-praised (and 
much-missed) La Toque; baker Susan formerly worked for the Il Fornaio chain of 
bakeries. Together this sophisticated pair run what is probably the Antelope 
Valley's best restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 The woodsy, high-ceiling cafe, illuminated during the day by a central 
skylight, looks bigger than when I first visited it nearly three years ago, 
because the bakery section has been transformed into a banquet and function 
room. (The baking -- mostly breads, cakes and cookies -- is now done in the 
enlarged kitchen.) In those days, of course, it wasn't Downtown yet, but just 
plain Cakes and Company. 
</P>
<P>
 At dinner, when Mitchell Frieder cooks a mixture of creative specialties and 
simple American fare such as fried chicken with biscuits, the restaurant is 
patronized mostly by people from the neighborhood. At lunch and brunch, the 
meals I feel really define this restaurant, the place can get quite busy. 
</P>
<P>
 So brunchers should come early on Sunday, because the place fills up fast. 
What the brunch menu calls company hash is one reason; it may be off limits to 
a Weight Watcher, but it's one of the most delicious ways I know of to start a 
day. Imagine a finely minced homemade corned beef hash, pan-fried to a crunchy 
brown, topped with two delicately poached eggs and served with homemade bread, 
apricot jam and big pieces of melon, grapefruit and orange. 
</P>
<P>
 Brunch also features fluffy oatmeal, flecked with bits of dried apricot and 
what appear to be swollen currants. There are wonderfully light pancakes called 
heavenly hots, which get their fluffy texture from plenty of sour cream in the 
batter. One of my more moderate friends has made an entire brunch out of the 
pear and walnut salad, which balances the fruits and nuts with green and red 
leaf lettuce, crumbled blue cheese and lots of smoky bacon. I have found myself 
stoking up on the Frieder's sizzling patties of country sausage and baking 
powder biscuits. 
</P>
<P>
 At lunch (weekdays plus Saturdays), the sandwiches and main dishes are solid, 
but the best things to eat are probably the appetizers. They include a colorful 
version of humus, flooded with tahineh sauce and served with chopped cucumber 
and tomato and spiced wedges of pita toast. The Asian-inspired pot stickers, 
with their light minced chicken-and-vegetable filling, are delicate and exotic. 
From the other end of the map comes a Swiss-style potato cake ( rosti ) topped 
with sour cream and golden caviar.  
</P>
<P>
 Those sandwiches come in all shapes and sizes, on a variety of breads baked 
right here. A slice of peppery meatloaf is served on whole wheat with onions 
and barbecue sauce. An unusual grilled prawn sandwich garnishes the prawns with 
rosemary onions, shredded lettuce and scallion mayonnaise, all on a homemade 
baguette. This is one of the few places in the vicinity where you can get a 
cheese steak: five ounces of top sirloin with melted cheese, served on a 
buttermilk roll. There's even plain old turkey, but the meat is baked on the 
premises, rather than sliced off a processed turkey roll. 
</P>
<P>
 You'll also find pastas, pizzas, a fish du jour and several saute dishes on 
the lunch menu. The most interesting entree is probably prawns del rey , 
sauteed in a spicy, smoky tomato sauce redolent of Southwestern spices and 
roasted pepper. The best pasta is penne with rosemary, spinach, capers and 
Bulgarian feta. 
</P>
<P>
 You knew there were going to be desserts from the name of the restaurant, but 
you probably never guessed at the variety of them. The more serious desserts 
include a crusty blueberry cobbler topped with a baking powder biscuit; 
California cake, which is spongecake with a lemon curd filling and a rum butter 
cream frosting; and chocolate death -- a chocolate layer cake with chocolate 
mousse and a chocolate glaze frosting. One of my Antelope Valley friends 
prefers the classic strawberry tart, where sliced strawberries rest on a 
circular crust topped with rich vanilla cream.  
</P>
<P>
 And there are always homemade biscotti , chewy pumpkin cookies and various 
shortbreads on hand to accompany your espresso. Metrolink passengers may want 
to buy their cakes to go, to help down their coffee on that long train ride 
into the Basin. WHERE AND WHEN

NEWS ANALYSIS; TURBULENT MARKETS SEEN MASKING HEALTHY ECONOMY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES FLANIGAN and TOM PETRUNO, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For millions of Americans, something scary is happening. For three years, they 
have poured record amounts of their savings into stock and bond mutual funds, 
in effect betting on a healthy U.S economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But now that the economy is finally rolling along, they are seeing sudden and 
serious declines in the value of the investments they have made for retirement, 
college tuition and other long-term goals. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, rising interest rates have made mortgages more expensive, 
cutting into one of the great benefits for U.S. homeowners and buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 What is going on? Markets in part are responding to fears that things are too 
good, analysts say. The fear is that economic growth will surge at such a pace 
that it brings back the corrosive inflation of the 1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 But there are new and different forces at work. High-rolling global 
speculators, who also have pumped vast amounts of money into stocks and bonds 
worldwide over the past year, have been forced by sudden turns in the markets 
to stampede for the exits. 
</P>
<P>
 The situation may look perilous, but many financial and economic experts say 
the markets' reaction in recent weeks is overblown and does not threaten the 
healthy long-term outlook for the economy, inflation and investments. They 
advise ordinary investors and mortgage holders to keep an eye on the underlying 
strength of the U.S. economy and not be diverted by short-term swings. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's way too much concern," says Charles Clough, chief investment 
strategist for the giant brokerage Merrill Lynch. "The story remains that U.S. 
industry is increasingly efficient and competitive worldwide." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said as much last month when he 
surprised Wall Street by raising short-term interest rates slightly, the first 
official hike in five years. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan, who described the U.S. economy as being in its best shape in 30 
years, made clear that his intention was to keep a moderating hand on the 
expansion while countering speculative excesses -- two goals that Wall Street 
normally would cheer. But the Fed's action has had dramatic unintended 
consequences, sending mortgage rates surging and stock prices tumbling 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason for those consequences was the extent of speculation in global 
markets, where mega-investors like London-based George Soros have placed 
massive amounts of borrowed capital in international securities and currency 
markets. These so-called "hedge funds" made huge bets early this year in Europe 
and Japan. But their investments, more than $300 billion by some estimates, 
have gone sour as a result of Greenspan's action to raise interest rates and 
defuse the speculative threat. 
</P>
<P>
 This selloff has been a major cause of the market gyrations and led to fears 
that the U.S. economy and financial markets are now on the brink of a long 
decline, reminiscent of the crash of 1987 and the bear market of 1973. 
</P>
<P>
 But most financial experts say the current environment is not at all like 
those earlier times. On the contrary, the U.S. economy has turned the corner 
from recovery to expansion. Economists now predict growth of 3.6% this year, or 
an additional $216 billion worth of economic activity. California may not join 
fully in such good times until early next year, although a better national 
economy could quicken the pace here. 
</P>
<P>
 That kind of economic growth creates jobs. In the latest surveys, companies 
throughout the economy say they plan to hire more people in the second quarter 
of 1994. Corporate profits are rising, especially for companies that supply 
machinery and services to industry overseas, such as Caterpillar Inc. and 
General Electric. 
</P>
<P>
 This is the basis for sustained economic growth that will produce rising 
profits and ultimately a return of rising stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, increased inflation is not seen as a real threat because 
productivity -- output per hour of labor or dollar of investment -- is rising 
more than it has in years. It is increasing across the board, in both 
manufacturing and service industries. And that means low or decreasing 
inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the economies of Europe and Asia are adjusting to the 
post-Cold War period, as the U.S. economy has been doing since 1990. Though the 
effort to change Japan's has led to a very public dispute, it is not likely to 
upset an increasingly interdependent and growing world economy, most economists 
agree. 
</P>
<P>
 The contrast with earlier periods of economic change and market swings is 
dramatic. In 1973, the start of a major market downturn saw a quadrupling in 
the price of oil and the instability of Watergate in the U.S. government. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1980, then Federal Reserve Chairman Paul A. Volcker was forced to bail out 
U.S. and international banks that had become overextended in the 
inflation-driven speculations in silver, oil and other commodities. He also had 
to take stern action, and trigger a recession, to break the back of 
double-digit inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan, who acted quickly to curb the market slide in 1987, may have made a 
timely move again. He stepped in to curb the threat of inflation and 
speculation before the system was pushed to the brink. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, even the fact that the nest eggs of the average American investor could 
be threatened by excesses of esoteric financial concepts like "interest rate 
swaps" and "currency futures" will infuriate and puzzle most people. If such 
things are a threat, why are they allowed at all? 
</P>
<P>
 The answer is that hedge funds and other financial exotica are part of a new 
and still-emerging global financial system in which more than $1 trillion of 
securities, currencies and all manner of financial instruments are traded every 
day, with many benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 "The trading is maximizing the efficiency of capital movements, bringing 
together money that is available in one spot but required in another," says 
Dennis Weatherstone, chairman of J.P. Morgan & Co., one of the world's leading 
banks and a leader in these markets. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, he notes that such markets make loans and other capital much more 
available for building factories and power plants in countries like Mexico, 
China and Indonesia -- developments that bring profits and jobs to American 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, these markets are a reflection of how American money has become so 
tightly linked to other countries and economies around the world. And this is 
why average mutual fund holders in the United States find their savings 
affected by hedge fund investments gone awry. 
</P>
<P>
 There are dangers in this system and the consequence of bad investment 
decisions could mean the failure of a developing country's loan or the 
bankruptcy of a speculative fund. 
</P>
<P>
 But most experts accept such risks for the benefits that a global market 
brings, so long as the bankruptcies don't get too large and their consequences 
spread too far.

L.A. SAYS DEVELOPER HAS CUT IT OUT OF SHARE IN MALL; BUSINESS: CITY EXPECTED 
EVENTUAL PROFITS FROM BALDWIN HILLS CRENSHAW PLAZA. BUT FIRM SAYS IT WAS SOLD 
AT A LOSS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN L. MITCHELL, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Alexander Haagen, a mall developer who has received millions in public funds 
to build shopping centers in financially risky areas, has cut the city of Los 
Angeles out of what it sees as its share in the Baldwin Hills Crenshaw Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 The plaza, the first major U.S. mall built in a predominantly African American 
community, was constructed under a 1984 agreement between Haagen and the 
Community Redevelopment Agency in which the city was to receive half of any 
profits. 
</P>
<P>
 But Haagen angered CRA commissioners by selling the mall to a real estate 
investment trust that he controls and pulling the plug on his 10-year 
partnership with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has spent $50 million in developing the gleaming, art deco shopping 
center. But because the mall was sold at a loss, Haagen company officials 
contend, there were no net proceeds to share with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen officials say the sale, conducted as part of a public stock offering, 
does not violate their agreement with the CRA. They insist that the city has 
already benefited from taxes, new jobs and increased economic activity in the 
Crenshaw community. 
</P>
<P>
 The mall has been losing money since it opened in 1988, but it is expected to 
begin turning a profit when a $12-million theater deal is completed with former 
Laker Earvin (Magic) Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials say Haagen used the sale as a way of maneuvering around his 
agreement with the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very troubling," said Shelby Jean Kaplan Sloan, a CRA commissioner. "We 
put in so much money and now we are just stripped. It's very distasteful." 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas, whose district includes the mall, said the 
matter will have to be negotiated with Haagen. "They can say what they wish, 
but the final word has not been delivered on this," he said. "The city's 
interest will be protected without killing any projects, for example, the 
theater deal." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute revolves around interpretation of the agreement between the CRA 
and Haagen, a Manhattan Beach developer. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's our position that what occurred was a legal sale," said Fred Bruning, a 
vice president of the new Alexander Haagen Properties Inc. "If you look at the 
documents, it says in event of a sale, the city has no ongoing interest." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the developer went public in late December, the CRA has been scrambling 
to determine how to interpret the move, which may eventually be settled in 
court. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are looking at it now to see if those rights (to the mall) can be 
transferred to a new entity," Sloan said. "We're trying to determine legally 
what our rights are. . . . This isn't the end of this." 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, at the same time that Haagen was ending the partnership, he was 
also urging the CRA to approve a $1.5-million loan for Johnson's 12-screen 
theater deal. The Johnson project would create the largest black-owned cinema 
in the nation.  
</P>
<P>
 But because of the dispute with Haagen, the agency has put the theater deal on 
hold. "Now why should the city invest in the theater if we no longer have a 
stake in the mall?" asked a CRA official who did not want to be named. 
</P>
<P>
 The theater deal is a separate arrangement, Bruning said. The city's loan 
would be backed by an $8-million investment from Haagen and $2 million from 
Johnson. The project would include a multiplex theater and a parking garage. 
"Without the loan from the city," Bruning said, "the deal is too thin to work." 
</P>
<P>
 Before the 1984 deal was struck, then-Mayor Tom Bradley had to personally 
lobby the Broadway and May Co. not to close their Crenshaw stores, which were 
the anchors of the old Crenshaw Shopping Center, the nation's first regional 
mall. Haagen, who has built three successful inner-city shopping centers in the 
Los Angeles area, was the only bidder to emerge after a national search for a 
developer of a larger, enclosed mall. In addition to keeping the May Co. and 
Broadway committed to the project, the developer brought in Sears, a Lucky 
supermarket and other stores and restaurants. 
</P>
<P>
 Both Haagen and the city invested millions in the project in an effort to 
assure its success. But the profits have yet to come. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shopping center opened, the developers were still seeking to attract 
tenants. National retailers were skittish at first about putting stores in a 
largely black, middle-class community. 
</P>
<P>
 In the last few years, the recession has been an added strain on Haagen, who 
like many shopping center developers has become burdened with debt and strapped 
for cash. Haagen refinanced his operation by selling the mall and most of his 
other holdings to a newly formed real estate investment trust, a publicly 
traded company that he controls. 
</P>
<P>
 At its initial public offering, Alexander Haagen Properties offered 10.8 
million common shares at $18 a share. The trust is listed on the American Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
 The move put Haagen among a growing list of real estate developers who have 
turned to the public marketplace to obtain capital to purchase property or make 
loans, typically investing in shopping centers, medical buildings, apartment 
buildings and mortgages on commercial properties. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Haagen Properties now owns the plaza, the Burbank Media City Center 
and 34 other Haagen properties. Haagen is the new company's board chairman and 
chief executive officer. Bradley is one of the members of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen's jump into the market has caused concerns in Burbank, where the 
developer also had a long-term joint partnership agreement for the mall, which 
still operates in the red. But under different contract language in its 
agreement with Haagen, Burbank retains its 50% interest in the Media City 
Center mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruning said no such protections were written into the agreement in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Haagen turned to the real estate investment trust to raise money after 
traditional lending sources had soured. The developer expected to retire more 
than $200 million in debt and finance such projects as a new theater and 
parking structure at the plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruning said it is wrong to think that the city has not received a fair return 
on its investment in the mall. In addition to increased tax revenues, the mall 
has generated more than 900 jobs and is home to 92 businesses, of which 25 are 
minority-owned. 
</P>
<P>
 He said there are still a lot of questions to be answered, but in the end 
everyone will be satisfied. "I believe when the dust settles and the smoke 
blows away everyone will agree that this is a good deal for the city, the 
project and a good deal for the community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Commissioner Sloan said the city will try to determine what 
went wrong, if anything. No one currently on the board was serving when the 
documents were approved. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it's because of a loophole, then perhaps we didn't make certain that the 
document had the language that could have prevented the sale without our 
approval," she said. "In the future we want to make sure that we are 
protected," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are things you can anticipate and things you can't. It could have been 
a mistake, an oversight or just 20-20 hindsight."

U.S. REIMPOSES LAW TO ALLOW TRADE SANCTIONS ON JAPAN; MARKETS: THE MEASURE, 
CALLED SUPER 301, PERMITS PUNITIVE TARIFFS AGAINST NATIONS FOUND TO DEAL 
UNFAIRLY. TOKYO STRONGLY PROTESTS, SAYING ACTION VIOLATES GATT.

<P>
 Triggering a storm of protests from Japanese leaders, President Clinton on 
Thursday reinstituted a provision of U.S. trade law that will allow the United 
States to retaliate against Japanese imports if Japan fails to open its markets 
to American goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure will allow the Administration to impose trade sanctions, such as 
punitive tariffs, against any country found to engage in unfair trade practices 
that keep U.S. products out of its markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Delays built into the process, as well as the Administration's plan to 
gradually turn up the pressure on Japan, make it unlikely that the measure, 
known as Super 301, would have a tangible impact on the cost of Japanese 
products in this country unless the trade dispute continues to fester until the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, there is significant symbolic impact in the decision, which U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced after Clinton spoke earlier in the 
day by telephone with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's action followed the breakdown of trade talks between 
President Clinton and Hosokawa last month. It brought a warning of trouble to 
come from Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the top government spokesman, said 
today that this kind of "unilateral" measure is "explicitly prohibited" by the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Japan, he said, "strongly hopes that 
the government of the United States will act in a sensible manner," but also 
"recognizes the need for a restrained response." 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura noted that the government has recently "reaffirmed its intention to 
advance voluntary measures toward further market opening." 
</P>
<P>
 Super 301 expired in 1990, two years after Congress enacted it as part of 
comprehensive trade legislation. But the Administration has said that it has 
the authority to reinstate it by presidential order. 
</P>
<P>
 During its earlier use, it provoked deep opposition among the Japanese. 
Although sanctions were never applied, U.S. officials said that, with varying 
degrees of success, it pushed Japan into increasing purchases of U.S. 
satellites, some wood products and supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
 The toughened trade regulation, which is to remain in effect through 1995, is 
one in a series of steps contemplated by the White House to pressure the 
government in Tokyo to open its markets to U.S. products. In 1993, Japan ran up 
a $59.3-billion trade surplus with the United States, and a $131-billion global 
trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously with the new trade action, the Clinton Administration moved to 
use antitrust measures to combat Japanese practices judged to inhibit sales of 
American goods in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to the Japan Society in New York, Anne Bingaman, assistant 
attorney general for antitrust, said the Administration would take legal action 
against monopolistic practices in Japan and by Japanese companies operating in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingaman noted that Japan has promised for years to stop organizing industry 
cartels that exclude foreign competitors. "But, after all is said and done," 
she said, "the question still remains whether there has really been any 
meaningful change in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the decision to reinstate Super 301, it represented a clear signal to 
Japan, in the wake of the breakdown in trade talks, that the Administration 
will make it more and more costly for the Hosokawa government to back away from 
an agreement its predecessor made with Clinton last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Japan agreed to negotiate a system by which progress could be 
measured in opening the Japanese market to the United States in four areas: 
automobiles and auto parts, telecommunications, medical equipment and 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations fell apart Feb. 11, hours before Clinton and Hosokawa met at 
the White House, and the prime minister is said by aides to be preparing an 
import-promoting trade proposal to be announced at the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's procedure, spelled out in an executive order that 
the President signed Thursday, would work this way: 
</P>
<P>
 * Each year the trade representative would send to Congress a National Trade 
Estimate Report, which would list trade barriers -- quotas, tariffs and other 
procedures that countries follow to keep out foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
 * By Sept. 30, the Administration would identify the nations on the list with 
the most egregious barriers, setting in motion a short investigation after 
which tariffs, or taxes on imports, could be levied. The tariffs could be as 
high as 100% of the value of a specific import. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a list of specific countries or industries, it is impossible to 
determine where the tariffs would be applied. But a senior Administration 
official pointed out that "autos and auto parts are front and center" in the 
agreement that brought about the disrupted negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedure, Kantor said, "is a flexible instrument" that permits him "to 
send our trading partners an early warning that certain of their practices may 
be identified in the future if they are not eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Clinton said that his order will help to "open markets 
that will create better jobs and increase wages at home and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Japan, Hosokawa told Parliament that he hopes the United States will 
"take sensible action based on a sensible judgment." 
</P>
<P>
 Hiroshi Kumagai, minister of international trade and industry, warned at a 
news conference that the kind of "unilateral" approach embodied in Super 301 
would lead to "a shrinkage of global trade through mutual retaliation among 
trading partners." 
</P>
<P>
 Kumagai said the United States and Japan should remain calm to avoid falling 
into a "vicious spiral of sanctions and retaliation." At the same time, he 
said, Japan should make its utmost efforts to cut its huge trade surplus and 
improve foreign access to its markets. 
</P>
<P>
 The rising tensions over trade brought a further strengthening of the yen and 
a chill to Tokyo stocks. Foreign-exchange traders were betting that Washington 
would favor a stronger yen, which makes Japanese exports more expensive in 
dollar terms and thus harder to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar closed Thursday in Tokyo at 103.92 yen, down 0.9% in the two days 
since it was reported that the trade provision would be revived. But it 
rebounded to 104.60 in trading today in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese officials and others questioned whether the unilateral actions 
contemplated in the President's order would be permitted under the 
international trade agreement completed in Geneva in December after a series of 
negotiations known as the Uruguay Round. 
</P>
<P>
 "The European Union will be examining carefully . . . these measures and 
checking whether their implementation would be contrary to the United States' 
trade obligations, including those agreed in the Uruguay Round," said Leon 
Brittan, the European commissioner for external economic affairs. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Geneva, an official of GATT, which oversees the rules of international 
trade, has indicated that the organization would look favorably on a complaint 
that tariffs were being applied unfairly and without adherence to the 
organization's procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, international economist Jagdish Baghwati of Columbia University said, 
"nothing unites the world against the United States as much as 301." 
</P>
<P>
 But in Washington, the measure was applauded by members of Congress, where 
pressure has been building for the Administration to take concrete steps in 
response to the failure of the so-called framework talks with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerstenzang reported from Washington and Holley from Tokyo. Times staff writer 
Scot Paltrow in New York contributed to this story. Bringing Out the Big Stick 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration, frustrated by Japan's failure to buy U.S. goods, wants to 
force Japan to open its markets by reinstating a provision of trade law known 
as Super 301. What Is Super 301? 
</P>
<P>
 Under the provision, the U.S. trade representative prepares a list of 
countries that have erected the most egregious trade barriers against American 
products. After further investigations, the Administration has the power to 
impose retaliatory tariffs of up to 100%. Consumer Impact 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely the measure would have a tangible impact on the cost of 
Japanese products in this country unless the dispute festers until the end of 
the year. But U.S. companies, primarily autos and auto parts, stand to achieve 
major gains if markets open. U.S. Trade Deficit with Japan

HOUSE LEADERS STUDY SLOWER HEALTH REFORM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAREN TUMULTY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 House Democratic leaders, in their first tacit concession that major 
components of the Clinton health plan are unlikely to pass, are considering a 
more gradual approach that would not impose immediate cost controls or require 
Americans to join government-organized purchasing cooperatives. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo.) said Thursday that 
Democratic leaders do not believe that they can abandon another controversial 
element of the President's proposal -- a requirement that employers buy health 
insurance for their workers. Unless employers are involved, Clinton's basic aim 
of assuring that all Americans have health coverage is in jeopardy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt's comments were the most explicit by any Democratic leader to date 
about the need to revise central elements of President Clinton's plan. 
</P>
<P>
 His remarks were also significant in their timing. The health care debate "has 
just been blather up until now. Now, you're getting down to serious business," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 With polls showing the public increasingly uneasy about the specifics of the 
Clinton plan, a growing chorus of its opponents are declaring it doomed. In his 
comments to a small group of reporters, the majority leader seemed to concede 
the point in hopes of moving the debate forward to other alternatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's been wanting to pronounce dead or alive the Clinton bill, and I 
don't think that's relevant," Gephardt said. "The question is, is there a way 
to get a bill that reflects their goals through the Congress and on his desk, 
and I think there is." 
</P>
<P>
 The House initially had been considered a far more hospitable environment for 
the President's plan than the Senate. But House Democratic leaders are finding, 
to their dismay, far more opposition to various parts of the plan than they had 
expected. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one key House subcommittee has abandoned any effort to agree on a 
version of the proposal. The Energy and Commerce Committee announced Wednesday 
that it will take the unusual step of bypassing its health and environment 
subcommittee to attempt to write the bill at the full committee level. But the 
panel's Democratic membership is heavily weighted toward the more conservative 
end of the party. 
</P>
<P>
 Gephardt said survival of the health plan in the House is riding on the Ways 
and Means Committee, whose health subcommittee is scheduled to begin work next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can get out of the Ways and Means Committee, I think you may have a 
bill that can get 218 votes (a majority) in the House," the majority leader 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Two approaches now appear to be taking shape among Democrats on the Ways and 
Means health subcommittee. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Pete Stark (D-Oakland), the panel's chairman, is putting together an 
alternative that would establish a new Medicare program to cover the uninsured, 
require employers and employees to pay for health insurance and impose cost 
controls on premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Another faction of the subcommittee is trying to fashion a version with less 
regulation than the Clinton plan. "We're striving to see if we can find that 
balance that six of us can vote for," said Rep. Sander M. Levin (D-Mich.), who 
is among those striving for the latter plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside the committee, however, a growing number of Democrats and Republicans 
apparently favor the idea that the best approach is a minimal one -- and one 
that does not assure guaranteed health coverage for all Americans. These 
lawmakers advocate combining such widely agreed upon reforms as making coverage 
portable from one job to another and preventing insurance companies from 
denying policies to people who have serious illnesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty House members -- 15 from each party -- introduced such a bare-bones 
approach Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's get started with the foundation. We can build the house later," said 
Rep. Bill Zeliff (R-N.H.), a co-sponsor of the legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gephardt argued that, until everyone has health insurance, the only thing 
that marginal reforms will produce is higher insurance premiums. That is 
because the costs of medical care for the uninsured would continue to be 
shifted onto people who have coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 Some argue that costs would rise even faster because insurance companies would 
be forced to offer coverage to sicker people, whose care is the most expensive, 
but would do so without receiving premiums from healthy people who choose to 
remain without coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 "The minimalist approach to me makes no sense," Gephardt said. "It will 
denigrate the name of reform because most people's premiums would go up with no 
benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 Many objections to the Clinton bill have centered on its intent to force more 
than 70% of the population into purchasing cooperatives, known as alliances. 
Some contend that mandatory alliances would inject too much big government into 
the health care system, and others have suggested that the elaborate structure 
is too complicated to work. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you can make alliances less mandatory; you can adjust the way they 
work and still achieve the goals," Gephardt said. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said it may not be necessary to impose government controls on the 
growth of health insurance premium costs: "A lot of objective observers believe 
that, if you have real competition, everybody (covered), you will get real cost 
constraint." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Gephardt said he did not see any means of achieving universal 
coverage without "some eventual way of requiring that all employers and 
employees be involved in health care." 
</P>
<P>
 He suggested that there might be significant room for compromise from 
Clinton's proposal, which requires most companies to pay 80% of their workers' 
premium costs. Among the options he cited: phasing in the mandate over a longer 
period, lowering the employer share or exempting smaller firms while giving 
their workers government subsidies to pay for their own insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats also are keeping a wary eye on a group of Senate and House 
Republicans who left Thursday for a Maryland retreat at which they will attempt 
to find more consensus in their party, where a strong conservative faction is 
arguing against a bill far-reaching enough to cover everyone. 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. John H. Chafee (R-R.I.), author of a comprehensive health plan sharing 
many of the Clinton goals, will attempt to convince his more conservative 
colleagues that universal coverage is crucial to any reform effort.

STAFFS TO BE REPLACED AT 3 SAN FRANCISCO SCHOOLS; EDUCATION: CLEAN SWEEP, WHICH 
NEEDS COURT OK, TARGETS PROBLEM CAMPUSES. BUT MANY TEACHERS AND STUDENTS 
OBJECT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEAN MERL, TIMES EDUCATION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a radical bid to rejuvenate troubled schools, education officials here plan 
to remove the entire staffs at three problem campuses -- teachers, cafeteria 
workers, everybody -- and start over from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
 If a federal court gives approval, as expected, for the "reconstitution" plan 
at the low-achieving schools, the three principals and about 200 other staff 
members could be transferred to schools throughout San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Denounced by critics as a misguided, meat-ax approach to school reform but 
hailed by others as a proven tool to improve the educational lot of the 
hardest-to-reach students, the San Francisco Unified School District's plan is 
being widely watched. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not complicated, it's not costly, and the idea of being able to start 
over with people (the schools) choose and people who have chosen to be there is 
attractive," said James Guthrie, a director of Policy Analysis for California 
Education, a Berkeley-based think tank. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is not a panacea, but it is not a bad thing to try," Guthrie added. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials of the 63,000-student San Francisco district say their plan is 
neither new nor untried but grew out of a long, court-sanctioned effort to 
desegregate its schools. Court approval is needed under a 1982 consent decree 
that mandated integration in the schools and a boost in academic achievement, 
especially for disadvantaged blacks and Latinos. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, a progress report concluded that while the district had largely 
achieved its desegregation aims, it had "not realized the goals for academic 
achievement for the overwhelming majority of African American and Hispanic 
students." 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, nine schools were given extra help and told they had until the 
middle of this school year to show improvement. Last month, Supt. Waldemar 
Rojas said Bret Harte Elementary, Visitacion Valley Middle School and Woodrow 
Wilson High School had not made the grade and he would seek court approval for 
their reconstitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Employees could reapply for their old jobs -- and officials said at least some 
would return to their schools -- and all will be guaranteed jobs somewhere in 
the district. But those assurances have done nothing to blunt the outcry at the 
targeted schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is superficial and disruptive, and it is not going to work," said Hene 
Kelly, who has taught health and English for 17 years at Wilson High. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with mounting complaints, the San Francisco school board held an 
emotional special meeting on the plan this week and got an earful, mostly from 
employees and students at the schools. Speaker after speaker criticized the 
process for judging the schools, questioned the success of two previous 
reconstitution programs and accused the superintendent of sacrificing the 
schools in order to please the court. 
</P>
<P>
 Many also said they were not given the extra help they were promised by 
district officials, and they asked for more time to turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one is proposing any real changes, and there are many needed at Wilson," 
student Leroy Hawkins, 17, told the board. "If you take the teachers out of the 
school, the students will have no one to bond with." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials defended their evaluation methods and said too much time 
already has been lost.  
</P>
<P>
 "Unfortunately, success doesn't happen equally at every place," Rojas said. He 
acknowledged that the idea has flaws but said the success at some other schools 
where similar steps were taken warrants moving ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "What it does boil down to in the end is whether the (Latino and African 
American) achievement rate in this district is tolerable," Rojas added. 
</P>
<P>
 For Fannie Jo Peagler, the black principal of Visitacion Valley, such remarks 
are particularly galling. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have worked hard to see that African American students get a fair shake 
and a quality education here," Peagler said, guiding a visitor through the 
halls of "Vis," an imposing three-story structure perched atop wooded, hilly 
parkland in one of the city's roughest neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we have a long way to go, but we have done a lot of work and we are 
beginning to make gains," said Peagler, who complained that Rojas has never 
visited the school and said the team making the decision spent only an hour 
there. 
</P>
<P>
 Slightly more than a third of the school's 520 students are black and about a 
fifth are Latino; the other major ethnic groups are Chinese (17%) and Filipino 
(13%). A majority of the students speak little or no English. About 14% are in 
special education classes. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of the students are poor enough to qualify for the free lunch 
program, and three-fourths scored below the 40th percentile on standardized 
tests.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've become social workers in this school," Peagler said. "We hope that 
finally we are at a point where we can spend as much time on academic skills as 
we did on getting these students coming to school ready to learn." 
</P>
<P>
 The school's timeworn halls are clean, their display cases full of classroom 
projects. The students are orderly, and staff members say the weapons, racial 
fights and drugs that plague many other urban campuses are absent from Vis. 
Student attendance is up, and outreach counselor James Love said he helps keeps 
it that way by providing incentives to come to school and do well there. 
</P>
<P>
 But test scores remain among the lowest in the district, and suspension rates, 
especially for blacks and Latinos, are unacceptably high, officials said. Most 
of the names on the honor roll posted outside the main office are those of 
Asian students. 
</P>
<P>
 In pushing the reconstitution plan, district officials are saying they believe 
that the students who still are struggling academically will have a better 
chance to succeed with a new staff. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Maria Ordona, whose son, Raymund, is an eighth-grader at Visitacion 
Valley, has mixed feelings about the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the teachers there are really doing good," Ordona said. "It would be 
unfair to them, and it might leave the students with another adjustment that 
might put them behind. 
</P>
<P>
 "But Raymund is my fifth child to go through Visitacion, and I think it used 
to be better a few years ago."  
</P>
<P>
 Charles Kerchner, an education professor at Claremont Graduate School who has 
written about school reform efforts, said there is great interest around the 
country in this kind of reform. Several districts have reconstituted staffs at 
struggling schools with good results, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually reconstitution has come through cooperation with employee unions, he 
said. In San Francisco, the effort is opposed by the two local unions with the 
assistance of the California Teachers Assn., which is monitoring the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea has a lot of appeal, but the downside of it is that you've got to 
have a better idea than the people who were there before," Kerchner said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Declaring a crisis and being willing to go in and seize the reins is one 
thing. Knowing what to do with them is entirely another matter."

'THREE STRIKES' BILL CLEARS STATE LEGISLATURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAN MORAIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Casting aside questions about cost and effectiveness, the Senate gave final 
legislative approval Thursday to a bill that would impose life sentences on 
habitual felons, and Gov. Pete Wilson said he will sign it as early as Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he signs the "three strikes and you're out" measure, it will become law 
immediately. The bill approved Thursday is virtually identical to a proposed 
voter initiative that may qualify for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 In a separate action, the Senate delayed action on four other bills, all of 
which would mandate life sentences for three-time losers. The bills will return 
to legislative committee, where they will be put into an anti-crime package, a 
process that could take a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the similarities of his initiative and the bill the Senate passed, 
Mike Reynolds, the proponent of the "three strikes" ballot proposition, vowed 
to press ahead to qualify the measure for the November ballot by submitting 
600,000 signatures by Monday, the legal deadline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to submit. There is no question about it," Reynolds said by 
phone from Fresno, where he works as a photographer, and where his 18-year-old 
daughter, Kimber, was shot to death in 1992 by a repeat felon. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he had said he would not push his measure if the Legislature approved 
the bill and it was signed into law by Monday, he said he concluded after 
Thursday's action that legislators could weaken it when they work on the other 
bills later. 
</P>
<P>
 The one way to ensure that third-time felons are imprisoned for life is for 
the electorate to approve his initiative in November, Reynolds said. Public 
opinion polls show the "three strikes" initiative is supported by more than 80% 
of the voters. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've held (the four other bills) like a trump card. They've forced our 
hand," Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate approved the legislation by Assemblymen Bill Jones (R-Fresno) and 
Jim Costa (D-Fresno) on a 29-7 vote, despite contentions by opponents that it 
could plunge the state into a long cycle of deficit spending. Many county 
prosecutors also favor one of the alternative bills because they believe they 
would be more effective than the Jones/Costa bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no military solution to the deepening quagmire of crime," Sen. Tom 
Hayden (D-Santa Monica) said, adding that the measure will be fiscally 
debilitating and will "harden our souls." 
</P>
<P>
 Sen. Lucy Killea, an independent from San Diego who also voted against it, 
compared the politicians who were supporting the measure to lemmings, and said 
that the bill's passage means "we can't call ourselves leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 The construction cost of housing the additional felons who will be imprisoned 
by the Jones/Costa bill -- and the initiative if it passes -- will be almost 
$22 billion, spread over the next 30 years. By then, the annual additional cost 
of operating the 70 new prisons to house the additional prisoners will be $5.7 
billion, the Department of Corrections estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Several proponents, including most Democrats who voted for the measure and 
some Republicans, acknowledged it will cost billions in years to come, and may 
not significantly reduce crime. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to vote for these turkeys because my constituents want me to," Sen. 
Leroy Greene (D-Carmichael) said. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote came even as the politics of the anti-crime movement took an ironic 
twist. Joe Klaas, the grandfather of the murdered 12-year-old Polly Klaas, 
lobbied to kill the Jones/Costa bill. It would cost far too much, Joe Klaas 
said, and, because of ambiguous wording, might endanger the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Polly's kidnaping and murder last year shocked the public and gave momentum to 
Reynolds' signature-gathering effort to place his "three strikes" initiative on 
the ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Joe Klaas and the Polly Klaas Foundation have embraced a competing bill by 
Assemblyman Richard K. Rainey (R-Walnut Creek). To give Rainey's bill added 
political power, Rainey and his backers renamed the measure the Polly Klaas 
Memorial Habitual Offender Reform Act. 
</P>
<P>
 Rainey's bill would impose sentences of life in prison without parole for 
people who commit a third violent or serious crime. It lists 15 violent crimes, 
such as murder, rape, armed robbery and some types of arson. 
</P>
<P>
 The Reynolds-backed bill headed to the governor's desk would impose life 
sentences with the possibility of parole after 20 years for criminals who have 
committed two violent or serious crimes and then commit any felony on their 
third offense. There are more than 500 felonies on the books in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The Jones/Costa bill, and the initiative it reflects, would result in more 
than 100,000 additional prisoners serving long prison terms by 2001, according 
to the Department of Corrections. Those additional felons would be in addition 
to the 170,000 expected to be imprisoned under the current laws. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Department of Corrections estimates that 20 additional prisons, 
each costing $500 million, will have to be built by the turn of the century to 
house the additional felons who would be imprisoned under the bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Those 20 prisons would be in addition to the 28 that exist already and the 12 
that must be constructed by 2000 to house the prison population expected under 
current laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer (D-Hayward) said he intends to work out 
details next week about how the remaining "three strikes" bills will be 
handled. The process should be completed by the end of this month, he said. He 
added that whatever emerges will not water down the Jones/Costa bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe when (the Jones/Costa bill) is behind us, we can move on to a more 
comprehensive discussion of crime in a less impassioned or less political 
atmosphere," said Lockyer, who voted for the measure even though he opposes 
much that is in it.

COLUMN ONE; OLYMPIC COMES OFF THE ROPES; IT WAS UGLY AND DIRTY, BUT IT WAS A 
GREAT PLACE TO WATCH A FIGHT. AFTER YEARS OF NEGLECT, THE LEGENDARY BOXING 
PALACE WILL REOPEN, WITH HOPES OF REVIVING A LANGUISHING SPORT. 
</P>

 The old fighter, who raged through the Olympic Auditorium when both he and the 
building were younger and stronger, faces forward, staring at the ring and the 
walls and the seats and the ceiling. Yes, Mando Ramos says, he remembers 
fighting at the Olympic when fighting at the Olympic was everything. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he turns from the ring and looks up into the balcony and deeper into 
his memory, pointing a finger straight at one single seat. "When I was a kid, I 
sat right up there ," says Ramos, 45, a two-time lightweight world champion and 
one of the greatest fighters Los Angeles has produced. "I was 11, 12, 13 years 
old. That's where I watched those great boxers. . . . I learned that boxing was 
beautiful. It's a ballet." 
</P>
<P>
 In that balcony seat, and in thousands of others, the lore of boxing was 
passed from father to son for nearly 70 years. In this building at 18th and 
Grand, boxing and Los Angeles were tied together during a long, boisterous era 
of wild fights -- and occasional riot nights. Jack Dempsey dedicated the 
Olympic in 1924, and thousands of good and lowly fighters consecrated it 
through the years. 
</P>
<P>
 But when Aileen Eaton -- the Olympic's major promoter and, without question, 
its heart, soul and mastermind -- retired in 1980, the building was gradually 
abandoned amid the squalor of its own disrepair and the brokenness of the 
neighborhood around it. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after nearly a decade sitting unused and in limbo, the Olympic is 
springing back to life -- but into a future that remains uncertain. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time in nearly eight years, big-time boxing is scheduled at the 
renovated Olympic Auditorium, beginning with Saturday night's card featuring 
Oscar De La Hoya. 
</P>
<P>
 Many had predicted that developer Jack Needleman would level the place after 
he bought it in 1980 from the Los Angeles Athletic Club, its longtime owner. 
"Tear it down? Never," Needleman says. "I could've sold it a hundred times. But 
we have a destiny here." 
</P>
<P>
 "The Olympic has been through fire, through earthquakes, through everything 
that has happened to Los Angeles in 70 years, and she still stands," says Luis 
Magana, the Olympic's Spanish-language publicist, whose ties to the building go 
back to 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 "She is still beautiful." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the building is freshly painted, clean and sparkling. 
</P>
<P>
 But left unanswered is this: Does the reopening of the Olympic mark the 
rebirth of boxing, or is it the last shadow of its passing? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Except for random concerts and movie shoots, the Olympic shut down in 1987 
because of boxing's dissipation as a major sport and the dilapidation of 
Downtown. The tickets weren't selling, the sport was perceived as crooked and 
the auditorium and the area around it were deteriorating. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a major modernization, the Olympic simply could not host big-time 
boxing. Without a sure audience, no one with major boxing ties would move into 
the building. 
</P>
<P>
 But to fight fans, closing the Olympic was akin to shutting Boston's Fenway 
Park to baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 In the vast and often preposterous history of boxing, the Olympic Auditorium 
has always been a gem, the largest showcase ever built specifically for the 
sport. The seats were tight and close, and the walls thundered with noise. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you there was an atmosphere -- it was unlike any other fight 
arena," says Eaton's matchmaker Don Chargin, whose reputation for pairing 
fighters earned him the nickname War-a-Week Chargin. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second that you would walk in, something would come over you. Your heart 
would start beating and you just knew that you were in strictly a fight arena. 
There's never been anything like it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just wondering if it's still going to be the same. If you get that same 
feeling." 
</P>
<P>
 Murals of past champions once covered the lobby walls, Jimmy Lennon served 
more like a master of ceremonies than a ring announcer, and the distinct smell 
of beer and urine swept through the hallways. 
</P>
<P>
 Dempsey's picture, long since painted over, towered on an exterior wall from 
which now hangs a huge canvas painting of De La Hoya. The dressing rooms were 
buried deep in the belly of the building, dark and suffocating. 
</P>
<P>
 "They must've been maybe 6-(feet)-by-6," says Lou Filippo, a referee now, who 
often fought at the Olympic. "They were dingy. You didn't want to be there for 
very long. You wanted to go out and fight." 
</P>
<P>
 The building has undergone a $5-million renovation in the last four months. 
New floors, doors, seats, dressing rooms and a capacity lowered several 
thousand to 7,600 were prompted by promoter Bob Arum's two-year commitment to 
bring 25 fight cards a year to the Olympic. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum, who looked to Eaton as a mentor during his early days as a promoter, 
says the Las Vegas casino-high roller blase that currently sustains boxing is 
also killing it. 
</P>
<P>
 It's in local hotbeds such as Los Angeles and New York where boxing really 
lives and breathes and where fans are born, the Las Vegas-based Arum says. 
</P>
<P>
 Without enticing future fans -- especially from the Latino community -- with 
the scent, glimmer and romance of old palaces like the Olympic, Arum says, the 
market for boxing will evaporate. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the auditorium's physical face lift is complete, creating a new fan 
base will be harder, Arum admits. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the years, boxing has faded in popularity and has been pushed to the 
corners of mainstream America: pay-per-view and cable TV. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum is concentrating on reaching the core audience that supported the Olympic 
in its salad days: the Latino community. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the Depression, the Olympic has been a sporting haven for many Mexican 
immigrants and their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Olympic Auditorium was the only entertainment we had," says Magana, who 
also hosted TV broadcasts from the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "No soccer, no nothing. What we had was boxing, wrestling and roller derby at 
the Olympic, every week. To the Mexican people, the Olympic Auditorium was 
L.A." 
</P>
<P>
 The demand is still there, Arum says, noting the high pay-per-view numbers in 
Latino neighborhoods for many bouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was no secret the tried and true formula of the Olympic for years was to 
end up getting local Mexican fighters against fighters from Mexico," Chargin 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 But once Eaton left, there was no one to keep that formula alive. Still, the 
Olympic did not close only because she was gone. 
</P>
<P>
 The Forum, the area's only other major boxing venue, for years has put on 
about two cards a month -- also with a heavy Latino influence. The neighborhood 
around the Olympic is not the best. The list of big-name ticket-selling 
fighters is not long. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm friendly with Bob Arum, and if anybody can bring it back, he can," 
Chargin says. "But boxing's changed. The way society is now, do people want to 
go down there at night? I guess we're just going to have to find out." 
</P>
<P>
 Arum's second show this month will feature several lesser-known Latinos. In 
April, South African heavyweight Francois Botha is scheduled to headline. 
</P>
<P>
 "(The dream of revitalizing the Olympic) is impossible," says Bennie Georgino, 
who managed fighters at the Olympic and was one of its last promoters before it 
closed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not drawing the people they used to draw in boxing unless you have a 
special interest fight, like a De La Hoya, who won a gold medal. And how many 
of gold medalists do you have? 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, it's a tourist crowd," he says. "A nephew of mine called, he wants 
four tickets, he's paying $1,000. He says it's history, he wants to bring his 
kids, show them. But will he go again? No. It's a landmark, it's really 
established itself as one of the great places of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it's past now. I don't think they could ever bring back the atmosphere." 
</P>
<P>
 Arum, though, is an imposing figure and a harsh negotiator who badly wants to 
move much of his operation to Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 He cut a deal for the promotional rights, even though Van Nuys-based Dan 
Goossen had first crack at the Olympic. 
</P>
<P>
 Arum has negotiated American and Mexican TV deals. He's got De La Hoya to open 
the place with glitz and has a broad stable of fighters to fill future cards. 
</P>
<P>
 He also has had a weekly fight series on ESPN for 14 years, but those bouts 
are spread throughout the country. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there are plenty of good fighters," Arum says. "Can we sustain them? 
No question. Do I have to bring some fighters from the East Coast? Yeah. Do I 
have to bring other ethnic fighters other than Hispanics? Yes, but that was 
always my goal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Out there, I think, is a new Mando Ramos. They just need the opportunity and 
the nurturing." 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel (reopening the Olympic) can save boxing on the West Coast," says 
Goossen, who says he could not provide a large-scale schedule. "There's enough 
talent out there for both the Forum and the Olympic." 
</P>
<P>
 When talks with Jack Needleman stalled last summer, Arum found it easier to 
deal with sons Steve and Dennis Needleman. Eventually Jack Needleman turned the 
building over to them. Arum agreed to a deal that apparently does not put him 
at risk for any of the $5 million in improvements. Other terms are not known. 
</P>
<P>
 "I frankly don't know if we can recapture the old-time atmosphere," Arum says. 
"I don't think you can, so many years later. But I think that what we'll be 
presenting will be as close as you can get. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believe if it can be done anywhere, it can be done here. This may 
very well be my last great accomplishment." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Built in 1924, the auditorium acquired its name not from the street about a 
mile away, but from the 1932 Los Angeles Olympic committee, which was seeking a 
venue for wrestling and boxing and lent its financial help to founder Jack 
Doyle during construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Olympic came into its own only when Eaton arrived. Promoter Cal Eaton sent 
his former secretary (then Aileen LeBell) to rescue the struggling operation as 
its business manager in 1942. She became its promoter in 1945, married Eaton in 
1948 and dominated the building, then owned by the Los Angeles Athletic Club, 
until she retired in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you, there's nobody that had the patience, that would stay there 
through thick and thin like she did," Chargin says. "Not Arum, not anybody. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was the Olympic. I stayed there after she left, but it was never the 
same." 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton, who died in 1987, evoked warmth from her employees and fighters, anger 
from those who disagreed with her and fear from those she confronted. 
</P>
<P>
 She vainly tried to get boxers to save their earnings, she cut off anybody who 
wronged her and, in a sport full of determined souls, she was the most 
determined person anyone around her can remember. 
</P>
<P>
 When boxing went through bad times, Eaton booked professional wrestling and 
roller derby. In the 1950s and '60s, Gorgeous George Wagner, Enrique Torres and 
other wrestlers drew thousands to the Olympic. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Thunderbirds roller derby team sold out whenever it played the 
rival San Francisco Bay Bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 And when things were going well in the ring, when Mando Ramos or Art Aragon or 
Don Jordan were blasting away in front of packed houses, Eaton made sure other 
fighters were in the system, blooming under them. 
</P>
<P>
 Sugar Ray Robinson, Joe Frazier and other greats also dropped in for 
occasional fights, but the heart of the enterprise was local. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our philosophy was to develop fighters and keep moving them up," Chargin 
says. 
</P>
<P>
 The fans were not averse to fights -- and, occasionally, riots. In 1964, when 
Alacron Torres of Mexico lost a split decision to Hiroyuki Ebihara of Japan, 
the enraged crowd rampaged through the building, causing more than $150,000 in 
damage. "I don't want to say rowdy, but it was always a robust crowd," referee 
Filippo says. "They tore up seats, broke the TV monitors, tried to burn down 
the seats. That was part of the scene then." 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 7, 1970, Mando Ramos and Ultimo (Sugar) Ramos staged a monumental 
battle of attrition. Mando Ramos took a bloody decision victory. With the 
Ramos-Ramos fight, a bout Chargin says was "the greatest fight I ever saw, and 
I think any of the 10,000 people there would agree," the Olympic almost 
certainly reached its zenith. 
</P>
<P>
 That fight had everything: boxers who appealed to the local crowd, an 
incredible pace, a pulsating audience. Afterward, as in many fights at the 
Olympic, everyone was exhausted. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hey, it wasn't anything like the seats were so great, or the paint was so 
great, or anything like that," says Jackie McCoy, who managed and trained five 
world champions who fought at the Olympic, including Mando Ramos. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a good place to fight." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Ghosts? The Olympic Auditorium has no ghosts. It has Luis Magana, and a 
handful of others, who walk through it as if they are keepers of a flame they 
fear has burned out for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never thought it was going to open again," Magana says. "I never thought 
there was going to be anybody with the capability and the resources to run it 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I think Bob Arum can make it. Bob Arum is a man of boxing, he knows his 
business, he knows who can draw and who can't draw. Arum, he's not a 
Johnny-come-lately, you can see it." 
</P>
<P>
 Chargin is promoting a fight card in Sacramento this week, so he won't be 
attending the Olympic reopening. But, almost whispering, he says he probably 
couldn't bring himself to show up either way. 
</P>
<P>
 "To this day I can't ride by, I go way out of my way to avoid it," Chargin 
says. "I'm glad they're fixing it up, starting again. I wish it a lot of luck. 
I am curious about it. I just hope I can get over this. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure I'll go later on. But I doubt if I would've been able to go to this 
one. There's just too much. . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 There's too much of himself, Chargin concedes, left in the old building. Too 
many people to miss. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure, there's a lot of pressure to try to match the quality of the Chargin 
fights," says Bruce Trampler, the man who will be the site's new matchmaker. 
"But it's funny, in talking to Jackie McCoy now, he says he thinks (young 
fighter) Carlos Hernandez can be better than Mando Ramos. And he's not slamming 
Mando. It just shows Jackie's rejuvenated now. 
</P>
<P>
 "The excitement, it spreads, it's contagious." 
</P>
<P>
 As always at the Olympic, the past, present and future blend into one. 
</P>
<P>
 Memories become predictions. Age becomes youth. Mando Ramos becomes Carlos 
Hernandez, who might have sat in the balcony to see the fights as a child not 
long ago, leaning forward, learning that boxing was beautiful. That it was a 
ballet.

SENATE REJECTS WILSON'S CHOICE FOR UC REGENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK GLADSTONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in the University of California's 125-year history, the 
state Senate has rejected an appointment to the 26-member UC Board of Regents. 
</P>
<P>
 In a setback Thursday for Gov. Pete Wilson, the Senate turned down his choice 
of Lester H. Lee, a Saratoga businessman and the first Chinese American to be a 
member of the governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 Until this week, the only gubernatorial choice for the board to fail to win 
confirmation was railroad magnate and politician Leland Stanford, who in 1883 
withdrew from consideration in the face of Democratic opposition. No regent had 
been rejected by legislative action, according to legislative and university 
officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats said they opposed Lee because of his willingness to go along with 
steep increases in student fees. But the decision was made against a continuing 
debate about the diversity of those who serve on the board. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson has been criticized for appointing friends and wealthy campaign 
contributors to the board. Democrats, who have demanded more racial and ethnic 
diversity, were criticized Thursday for blocking an Asian American from 
serving. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, 62, voiced disappointment "because I was trying to do an honest job" and 
said he was surprised to have run into a partisan roadblock. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Senate voted along party lines," Lee said in a prepared statement, 
"rather than naming the most qualified" and a minority representative "who can 
offer independent judgment and fiscal responsibility without regard to 
political consequences." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision suggests that new Senate President Pro Tem Bill Lockyer 
(D-Hayward) may set a tougher, more partisan tone in his dealings with 
Republicans than his predecessor, Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys). 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate had one year to act on Lee's nomination. The clock ran out Thursday 
when the upper chamber refused to overturn a decision by the Rules Committee, 
which had rejected Lee on Monday on a 3-2 vote along party lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Democrats cited Lee's willingness to accept large increases in student fees, 
which have jumped 113% to $3,400 a year since 1990, as well as raises for 
administrators. They contrasted his low-key style with another Wilson 
appointee, African American businessman Ward Connerly of Sacramento, whose 
nomination was approved Monday. Regents serve 12-year terms. 
</P>
<P>
 "The contrast was fairly dramatic," Lockyer said. "They were both Republican 
contributors, friends of Pete Wilson, but Connerly is willing to be critical of 
the university as an institution and Mr. Lee seems not to be willing to do 
that." 
</P>
<P>
 Lockyer added, "If there is any change that this vote represents (it) is that 
we do not intend to routinely rubber-stamp any governor's nominations, that we 
expect to offer some independent judgment about these appointments." 
</P>
<P>
 The decision was a victory of sorts for Sen. Tom Hayden (D-Santa Monica), who 
for the past year has urged his colleagues to make the regents more accountable 
for their actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Hayden and other critics have said the board was stacked with wealthy white 
men appointed by Republican governors. Hayden last year championed the 
opposition to the appointment of John Davies, Wilson's personal lawyer, to the 
regents. 
</P>
<P>
 Davies was confirmed but the debate over his nomination probably set the stage 
for the showdown over Lee. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's vote -- technically on a procedural question -- was a tough one for 
some Senate Democrats who face campaigns this year in districts with heavy 
concentrations of Asian American voters. The upper chamber voted 19 to 15 to 
reject a request by Republican Leader Ken Maddy of Fresno to withdraw Lee's 
name from the Rules Committee so the appointment could be considered by the 
full Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee, an immigrant, was named to the board a year ago and was allowed to serve 
for the full year without Senate approval. He earned a doctorate in mechanical 
engineering from Stanford, and in 1970 started his own company.  
</P>
<P>
 Opposition surfaced last month when the California Federation of Teachers 
announced its opposition, maintaining that middle-class Californians might soon 
be unable to afford to send their children to UC schools. 
</P>
<P>
 The strength of the opposition apparently caught Republican legislators 
off-guard and prompted Lee to rally support among Asian American groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee defended his support of a student fee increase, saying it was "for the 
best interest of the university." 
</P>
<P>
 University spokesman Mike Lassiter said Chinese Americans make up about 9% of 
the student population in the UC system. At least one other Asian American is a 
member of the governing body. 
</P>
<P>
 Maddy voiced disappointment that Lee must step down from the board. During a 
lively Senate floor debate, he hailed Lee as a superbly qualified appointee.

CLINTON VOICES 1ST ETHICS CONCERNS OVER WHITEWATER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID LAUTER and JAMES RISEN, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton on Thursday said for the first time that he is concerned 
about the appearance of impropriety stemming from meetings between White House 
and Treasury Department officials on the Whitewater controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 The statement came as Treasury's second-ranking official cut all ties to the 
continuing investigation of the role of then-Gov. Clinton and his wife, Hillary 
Rodham Clinton, in the failed Whitewater Development Corp. in Arkansas. 
</P>
<P>
 The White House -- hearing growing cries of "coverup" from congressional 
Republicans and others -- stepped up damage control efforts to try to keep 
Whitewater from blowing up into an uncontrolled political problem once again. 
</P>
<P>
 Senate Republicans, seeking to keep the issue alive, called for an 
investigation into the meetings between White House and Treasury officials and 
threatened to hold up confirmation of the Administration's choice for a senior 
banking regulatory position unless hearings are conducted. 
</P>
<P>
 As those efforts continued, pressure built on the White House official who has 
direct responsibility for avoiding ethical lapses -- White House Counsel 
Bernard Nussbaum. Despite widespread speculation inside the White House and on 
Capitol Hill, officials denied reports that Nussbaum intends to resign, saying 
that such rumors are premature. 
</P>
<P>
 But two officials conceded that Nussbaum has been widely blamed for Clinton's 
renewed difficulties. "Nussbaum may be a smart guy," said one former 
Administration official familiar with Whitewater issues. "But he's tone deaf." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Treasury Secretary Roger Altman met last month with three White House 
officials to brief them on a Whitewater-related investigation by the Resolution 
Trust Corp., of which Altman is the acting director. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior Administration officials said Thursday that Altman officially will 
remain the RTC's acting director until the end of this month but has now 
canceled all RTC-related meetings and activities. 
</P>
<P>
 Last fall, Treasury officials met twice with White House aides to discuss 
Whitewater-related matters. Officials at Treasury and the White House insisted 
that those meetings involved nothing other than efforts to respond to inquiries 
from reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday afternoon, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen issued a statement saying 
that he had ordered Treasury officials to have no further contact with the 
White House about Whitewater-related issues and had asked the independent 
Office of Government Ethics to examine the earlier meetings "to ensure that all 
ethical guidelines were followed." 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons invested jointly in Whitewater in 1978 with James B. McDougal, 
who owned Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan. They have said that they lost about 
$69,000 when the development failed. Special counsel Robert B. Fiske Jr. is 
investigating the Clintons' role in the real estate venture, whether funds from 
Madison -- which also failed -- might have been used to help pay off Clinton 
campaign debts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration containment effort on Thursday started with Clinton, who, 
in sharp contrast with his recent practice, gave reporters a lengthy answer 
when asked whether he is concerned about the appearance of improprieties in the 
case. 
</P>
<P>
 "The answer is yes, I'm concerned about that," he said. "As nearly as I can 
determine, no one has actually done anything wrong or attempted to improperly 
influence any government action, but I think it would be better if the meetings 
and conversations hadn't occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 Noting the several investigations of Whitewater-related affairs, Clinton said 
that "it's very, very important that, while all this is going on, that the 
activity around it should be handled in such a way as to avoid even the 
appearance of a conflict. In addition to what the rules are, what I want the 
people here to understand is never mind what the rules are, bend over backwards 
to avoid the appearance" of a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton's remarks were in sharp contrast to earlier statements by him and top 
aides on Whitewater. Until Thursday, they had brushed aside complaints about 
appearances, insisting that, because no one has been proven to have engaged in 
wrongdoing, allegations about appearance problems are politically motivated. 
</P>
<P>
 That earlier approach remained at the Justice Department, however, where Atty. 
Gen. Janet Reno dismissed questions about Associate Atty. Gen. Webster Hubbell, 
a longtime Clinton friend from Arkansas. The Washington Post reported earlier 
this week that Hubbell's former law firm, the Rose Law Firm of Little Rock, 
Ark., was investigating allegations that Hubbell had overbilled clients. 
Hubbell has denied any overbilling. 
</P>
<P>
 Reno gave Hubbell a strong vote of personal confidence, saying: "I have been 
extraordinarily impressed with his honesty, his candor, his professionalism and 
the sacrifices he's making to serve the American people. 
</P>
<P>
 "He advised me that he had not overbilled or done anything wrong. At this 
point, I have no substantiated information that Mr. Hubbell is doing -- has 
done anything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 But Reno said that she had not asked anybody in the department to look into 
the matter. "At this point, all I know is that some unnamed source says that 
the law firm is looking at allegations of wrongdoing," Reno said. "All I know 
from substantiated sources of any kind is that the law firm is reviewing the 
matter, they've asked Web questions, he's answering the questions, and they're 
resolving partnership issues." 
</P>
<P>
 Whether either Hubbell or Treasury officials actually have done anything wrong 
remains in considerable doubt. In Hubbell's case, for example, a former senior 
partner at the Rose firm said Thursday that he knew of no indication of 
overbilling by Hubbell or of an actual "investigation" by the firm.

BOXER DISPUTES WILSON FIGURES ON IMMIGRANTS; FINANCES: SHE CALLS FOR U.S. 
SCRUTINY OF GOVERNOR'S ESTIMATED COST OF SERVICES TO UNDOCUMENTED RESIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Lashing out at Gov. Pete Wilson for relying on the federal government to pay 
the state $2.3 billion in illegal immigration expenses, Sen. Barbara Boxer 
(D-Calif.) said Thursday that she has asked the General Accounting Office to 
study the governor's cost estimates. 
</P>
<P>
 Boxer said the state's congressional delegation needs an objective analysis of 
the Wilson Administration's figures before seeking full reimbursement in 
Washington. Although Wilson is right to push for the money, it was 
irresponsible of him to count the $2.3 billion as anticipated revenue to 
balance his 1995 budget proposal, Boxer said during a breakfast meeting with 
The Times Washington Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you have to have a degree in graduate government studies to see 
what he's doing," Boxer said. "He wants to blame somebody else for the problems 
of the state, and that means all the problems." If the problem is crime, "he'll 
blame the Democrats. If it's his budget deficit, he'll blame the feds and 
(President) Clinton." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson Administration officials declined to respond to Boxer's remarks. The 
governor has been criticized by Clinton officials and some California House 
Democrats for inflating the state's cost of federally required services to 
illegal immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week Boxer plans to huddle with GAO officials to discuss how they will 
assess conflicting estimates of immigration costs. On April 28, the Wilson 
Administration is scheduled to meet with leaders of the California 
congressional delegation in an attempt to arrive at a consensus on how much 
money to pursue. 
</P>
<P>
 In a wide-ranging discussion, Boxer predicted an "ugly, horrible, brutal" race 
for governor this fall. She said she believes that California's unprecedented 
election in 1992 of two women senators will help Democrat Kathleen Brown 
because voters are getting accustomed to women serving in high political 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are more used to it," Boxer said. "They're excited at the thought. 
Just think about it. History, we can make even more history. We've already made 
history. Let's make more history. It's exciting. Let's do it. Then no one can 
catch up with us in California." 
</P>
<P>
 Although she and Feinstein have not yet offered to make joint campaign 
appearances on Brown's behalf, Boxer said she was certain it would be 
discussed. She added that she will help Feinstein's reelection effort this year 
"to the greatest extent that I can." 
</P>
<P>
 On the emotional immigration issue, Boxer reacted coolly to legislation 
offered by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) that would cut off 
federal funding for undocumented immigrant students from kindergarten through 
high school. She called the measure unconstitutional. 
</P>
<P>
 But Boxer said she did not oppose another Rohrabacher proposal that would 
require schools to report the number of illegal immigrant students, along with 
counting students who are legal residents but have one or more undocumented 
parents. Boxer said schools would have to be paid to compile the statistics, 
which would be used to help calculate the much-disputed costs of illegal 
immigration. 
</P>
<P>
 A budget battle is expected to develop between border states and the Clinton 
Administration over the federal government's obligation to pay states for 
providing services to undocumented immigrants.  
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration set aside no specific funds in its 1995 budget for 
the reimbursement Wilson is seeking. Budget Director Leon E. Panetta has said 
the Administration will seek to identify the cost of imprisoning undocumented 
felons -- a figure that Wilson says amounts to $300 million a year.

FAMILY CLAIMS WOMAN WAS VICTIM, NOT CAUSE, OF FUMES; MEDICINE: A RIVERSIDE 
COUNTY SPOKESMAN REPLIES THAT DOCTORS DID ALL THEY COULD TO SAVE HER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 The family of the woman whom authorities believe was the source of toxic fumes 
that forced evacuation of Riverside General Hospital's emergency room said 
Thursday they are angry that she has been cast as a "toxic monster" and blamed 
the hospital for her death. 
</P>
<P>
 "Whatever killed her is something she breathed at the hospital," said David 
Garcia, the brother-in-law of Gloria Ramirez, who died in the emergency room 
Feb. 19. 
</P>
<P>
 County spokesman Tom DeSantis bristled at the charge, saying the emergency 
room staff "heroically" continued their efforts to save the woman even as their 
colleagues collapsed around them. 
</P>
<P>
 Six emergency room attendants fainted -- one remains hospitalized -- after 
breathing what they characterized as ammonia-like odors coming from Ramirez's 
blood after they drew a sample into a syringe. In the ensuing confusion, two 
people unaffected by the fumes tended to her as she went into full cardiac 
arrest. Within minutes, the 31-year-old woman -- suffering from cervical cancer 
and weakened by nausea -- died. 
</P>
<P>
 Riverside County and state health officials and toxic specialists say they 
still have no idea what caused the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the Riverside City Fire Department hazardous materials team said 
they found nothing unusual in the emergency room when they took air samples, 
and are themselves baffled. 
</P>
<P>
 Results of an extraordinary autopsy -- in which pathologists and technicians 
donned special safety suits inside a specially built examination room -- are 
pending. The Riverside County coroner's office said preliminarily that she did 
not die of natural causes. 
</P>
<P>
 But the family said they are sure Ramirez was not responsible for the fumes. 
"We think toxic fumes came up from under her bed or somewhere, affected the 
staff and killed Gloria," Garcia said. "We're angry and outraged by all this 
cold speculation that characterizes Gloria as a toxic monster." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said his sister-in-law had been suffering from nausea because she was 
taking painkillers for her cancer. The side effects had left her dehydrated and 
short of breath, prompting the 911 call that resulted in her being taken to 
Riverside General Hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 At the hospital, a diagnosis of cardiac distress was made, and treatment for 
it began. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the ambulance attendants or paramedics who tended to Ramirez in the 
ambulance complained of illness or odors, even after they inserted an 
intravenous line that caused some blood to spill. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia speculated that a cleaning agent, perhaps containing a large amount of 
ammonia, was brought momentarily into the room, and the medical staff 
unwittingly inhaled it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Someone out there knows exactly what happened and now we want them to come 
forward, for the sake of Gloria's children," Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 He complained that the ensuing media attention given the incident has "turned 
into a science-fiction entertainment fiasco." 
</P>
<P>
 "If people are going to speculate, then let's think of all the possibilities, 
including that the fumes came up from beneath her, and not from her body," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ronald Schwartz, an attorney representing the Ramirez family, speculated 
Thursday that the syringe used in the blood sample might already have been 
contaminated by an unknown substance, and its reaction to the blood sparked the 
incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It could be something as simple as the syringe, or some kind of toxic waste 
in the emergency room or in a basin -- but whatever it was, she didn't bring it 
in there with her," Schwartz said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a Riverside Fire Department log and other reports, nurse Susan 
Kane drew a blood sample, remarked that it smelled unusual, and fainted. In 
quick succession, five others fell ill. 
</P>
<P>
 At about the same time, Ramirez went into full cardiac arrest and help was 
summoned. Dr. Huberto Ochoa, who heads the emergency room staff, arrived at 
Ramirez's side, ordered the evacuation of the emergency room and took charge of 
efforts to revive her. 
</P>
<P>
 He said later that he was not affected by whatever had stricken his colleagues 
but said he noticed white crystals in the syringe containing Ramirez's blood. 
"I'd never seen anything like it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The six people affected said they experienced various symptoms including 
dizziness, breathing difficulty and muscle spasms. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Julie Gorchynski, the most seriously affected, remains hospitalized in 
good condition at Loma Linda University Medical Center, recovering from muscle 
spasms and breathing difficulties, said spokeswoman Anita Rockwell. 
</P>
<P>
 Ramirez had been to Loma Linda twice to prepare for cancer treatment, Rockwell 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Schwartz, the family lawyer, said he was frustrated that the county has not 
been more forthcoming in providing results of its investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 County spokesman DeSantis said investigators are moving forward as quickly as 
possible. He said the syringe containing the blood sample "has been accounted 
for and is being analyzed."

ASSEMBLY PANEL OKS QUAKE BOND PLAN; RECOVERY: BUT DEMOCRATS AMEND PROPOSAL SO 
REJECTION BY VOTERS WOULD TRIGGER QUARTER-CENT SALES TAX HIKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A legislative committee reversed itself Thursday and approved Gov. Pete 
Wilson's proposed $1.05-billion bond issue to help California pay its share of 
repairing the damage from the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 But in doing so, majority Democrats on the Assembly Ways and Means Committee 
injected a new element in the financing plan that the governor opposes -- an 
amendment by Speaker Willie Brown that would automatically impose a 
quarter-cent temporary sales tax increase if voters reject the bond issue June 
6. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who is seeking reelection, has said he will not agree to a tax 
increase during this recessionary time to pay any of the state's $1.9-billion 
share of earthquake reconstruction efforts. Instead, he has offered the bond 
measure, which would finance about half of the state's obligation. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee action complicates the state government's response, but is not 
expected to cause any slowing of the rebuilding effort. The funds at issue are 
to be used for reimbursement of federal funds that are being spent now. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson's bond issue and Brown's proposed tax increase would require approval 
of two-thirds of each house of the Legislature -- at this point an unlikely 
outcome with Wilson, along with fellow Republicans, and Democrats sharply at 
odds over the tax issue. 
</P>
<P>
 However, both sides indicated that they may be willing to negotiate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Moving as expeditiously as we can far outweighs differences of tax policy 
that may split us," said Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys), who is carrying 
the governor's bill. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure will be debated before the full Assembly, probably next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson complained through a spokesman about the addition of Brown's tax 
provision, but did not declare a solution to be out of reach. "We are not 
backing away from the bond measure and feel there is still an opportunity to 
have a clean bond bill come out of the Legislature," said deputy press 
secretary J. P. Tremblay. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and other Democrats have criticized the Republican governor for failing 
to advance a contingency plan to finance earthquake recovery in case the voters 
reject his bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mine is the responsible plan," Brown said Thursday of his amendments to 
Wilson's bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The governor's bond issue was unexpectedly rejected by Democrats on the Ways 
and Means Committee on Wednesday, chiefly on the grounds that it did not 
contain a temporary tax increase for recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 The committee, at Brown's urging, called a special meeting Thursday to 
reconsider the issue. Democrats reversed themselves and approved the bond issue 
but inserted into it the Speaker's amendment calling for the temporary tax 
increase if voters killed the bond issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown is the author of a bill pending in the Senate that would raise $1.4 
billion over the next two years by increasing the statewide sales by 
quarter-cent on the dollar.

WILSON'S VETO OF DEPORTATION BILL STANDS AS OVERRIDE FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CARL INGRAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Senate on Thursday narrowly overrode Gov. Pete Wilson's veto of a 
bill to deport illegal immigrant felons from California prisons, but the 
Assembly declined to follow suit. 
</P>
<P>
 No veto has been overridden by both houses since 1979, when Democrat Edmund G. 
(Jerry) Brown Jr. was governor, according to legislative records. The last time 
either house voted to override was in 1984, when the Senate objected to 
then-Gov. George Deukmejian's veto of a school lease-purchase bond issue. That 
effort also failed in the Assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate voted for the override despite a stiff lobbying effort by Wilson to 
uphold his veto of a bill by Sen. Art Torres (D-Los Angeles). The vote was 
27-12, the exact two-thirds margin required in the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
 All 22 Senate Democrats, two independents and three breakaway Republicans -- 
freshmen Rob Hurtt of Garden Grove, Maurice Johannessen of Redding and Phil 
Wyman of Tehachapi -- voted for the override. All the votes supporting the veto 
were cast by Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
 Minutes after the Senate vote, the Assembly took up the override. But minority 
Republicans and a sprinkling of majority Democrats refused to give permission 
to debate the issue, leaving the veto intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday was the legislative deadline to act on the override. Torres' aides 
said, however, that a rule change will be proposed next week to extend the 
deadline 15 days. 
</P>
<P>
 Torres, who is running for state insurance commissioner, said his bill would 
save California taxpayers about $350 million a year in prison costs by turning 
over undocumented immigrant criminals to U.S. authorities for deportation. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill cleared the Legislature last summer without a dissenting vote as 
political pressure mounted for legislators to take action against illegal 
immigrants. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson, who has made illegal immigration an issue in his reelection campaign, 
said he agreed with the concept of Torres' bill. 
</P>
<P>
 But he said the bill was so technically flawed it could have the unintended 
consequence of freeing thousands of criminals in Tijuana "only to (have them) 
promptly return illegally to California to harm new victims."

DEFENSE; A-4 SKYHAWKS TO PATROL SKIES OF ARGENTINA; THE FALKLANDS STILL FRESH 
IN THEIR MINDS, THE BRITISH OBJECTED. IT'S A GOOD DEAL FOR BUENOS AIRES, AND 
U.S. AEROSPACE FIRMS WILL SEE SOME BUSINESS REFURBISHING 36 JETS.

<P>
 Over British objections, the United States is selling Argentina 36 A-4 
Skyhawks with advanced radar to replace some of the jet attack planes lost by 
the Argentines in their 1982 war against Britain over the Falkland Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina will get the used American planes cheap -- $200,000 to $300,000 
each, according to one source -- but it will spend hundreds of millions of 
dollars to have them refurbished and refitted. 
</P>
<P>
 The work will include installation of a Westinghouse radar system, classified 
as sensitive military technology, which Washington authorized despite the 
British opposition. Lockheed Aircraft Service Co., an Ontario-based subsidiary 
of the Lockheed Corp., is offering to do a major share of the refurbishing, as 
well as operate an aircraft manufacturing and maintenance plant in Argentina. 
</P>
<P>
 The Skyhawk deal signals growing U.S. trust in Argentina nearly 12 years after 
it invaded the Falklands, claiming sovereignty over the islands, which are a 
British possession. 
</P>
<P>
 Since taking office in 1989, President Carlos Saul Menem has emphasized a 
policy of harmony with the United States and its Western allies. Argentina has 
participated in U.N. peacekeeping missions, dismantled its only missile plant 
and signed the Tlatelolco treaty against nuclear arms in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
 Menem has also pledged repeatedly that Argentina will never again use force to 
back its historic claim to the Falklands, which Argentines call the Malvinas. 
</P>
<P>
 Argentina lost 60 to 70 aircraft, mostly Skyhawks, in the two-month war. For 
the last two years, it has been negotiating with the United States for the 36 
replacement planes, A-4M Skyhawk IIs. 
</P>
<P>
 The A-4M is a sub-sonic, single-seat aircraft with a Pratt & Whitney jet 
engine. An upgraded version of the A4A first built in the 1950s by McDonnell 
Douglas, it can be fitted with 20- or 30-millimeter cannon and can carry 10,000 
pounds of bombs, rockets, missiles or torpedoes. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Argentine officials say they want the planes and radar mostly for training 
purposes. U.S. officials say they will help Argentina respond to "legitimate 
defense needs" without upsetting the military balance in southern South 
America. Brazil and Chile, Argentina's biggest neighbors, have expressed no 
concern. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Argentina invited McDonnell Douglas, Lockheed and British-based 
Smiths Industries to submit bids for refurbishing the planes, which had been 
used by the U.S. Marines. Smiths won the competition and planned to contract 
the work under U.S. Navy management. 
</P>
<P>
 Total cost was estimated at $250 million. The planes are to be given new 
engines, avionics systems and radar fire-control systems. 
</P>
<P>
 In early February, Argentina said it wanted to give Lockheed a new chance to 
participate in the refurbishing. The Argentines are hoping to combine that deal 
into a package that would include reviving a military airplane factory at 
Cordoba, 400 miles northwest of Buenos Aires. 
</P>
<P>
 The Cordoba plant had been building Pampa jet trainers, but with no current 
sales contracts, it has fallen idle. Lockheed has proposed using the plant not 
only for refurbishing Skyhawks, but also as a permanent regional maintenance 
and repair center. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Lockheed might use the plant to service more than 100 C-130 
Hercules transport planes operated by South American armed forces. Argentine 
officials also hope that they eventually can sell Pampas to the U.S. armed 
services. Argentina's New Weapon 
</P>
<P>
 At $200,000 to $300,000 each, according to one source -- the American A-4 
Skyhawk come cheap. But Argentina will spend hundreds of millions to have them 
refurbished and refitted. 
</P>
<P>
 A-4 SKYHAWK Introduced: 1956 Speed: 670 m.p.h. Crew: One Range: 2,400 miles 
Length: 41 feet Wing span: 28 feet Builder: Douglas Aircraft, a division of 
McDonnell Douglas Mission: Light, single-jet aircraft is used in attack 
squadrons. Well-suited to destroying surface targets in support of landing 
force.

ARREST ORDERED FOR 83 VENEZUELANS IN BANK FAILURE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Eighty-three Venezuelan businessmen, including a member of one of the world's 
richest families, have been ordered arrested on suspicion of theft and 
swindling in the collapse of the nation's second-largest bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The order by a Penal Court judge late Wednesday suggested criminal wrongdoing 
was in part behind the closure of Banco Latino and not just managerial 
ineptitude and poor federal regulation, as authorities had initially suspected. 
</P>
<P>
 Banco Latino closed its doors in January after authorities removed it from the 
national check-clearing system for failing to meet commitments. 
</P>
<P>
 A government-appointed panel has been overseeing the bank and studying ways to 
pump money into it so it can be reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those ordered arrested was Ricardo Cisneros, a Banco Latino director and 
minority shareholder, whose billionaire family has vast holdings in banking, 
the news media, mining and food industries.

NEWS ANALYSIS; PEACE WOULD BE RABBIT OUT OF SALINAS' HAT; MEXICO: REBEL 
DELEGATES HEAD BACK TO JUNGLE TO PRESENT PACT TO COMMUNITIES. PRESIDENT'S TERM 
MAY NOT END IN DISASTER AFTER ALL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 As rebel delegates headed back to the jungle Thursday to present the peace 
agreement they negotiated with the government to their communities, the effects 
of the pact were beginning to ripple through Mexican politics. 
</P>
<P>
 The likelihood of a peaceful end to the conflict that began Jan. 1 is another 
rabbit pulled out of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari's top hat. His 
six-year term may not end in disaster after all. 
</P>
<P>
 But the magician could pay a high price for this last trick. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement addresses the rebels' complaints but provides no commitments 
from them, not even a hint of the conditions under which they might be willing 
to lay down their arms. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the conflict -- and agreement -- put in evidence several 
uncomfortable facets of Mexican politics and public life. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the sectors that have most ardently supported Salinas' free-market 
economic reforms are those most leery of the kinds of political reforms 
contained in the agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the pact was announced, business leaders worried it might signal a 
turn to populism, always a strong possibility during a president's last year in 
office. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing would be more dangerous than to leave the process of economic 
modernization incomplete," warned Ricardo Dajer, president of the National 
Chambers of Commerce Federation. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Salinas' willingness to consider breaking up large land holdings as 
part of the agreement cannot be comforting to agribusiness, which has already 
proven reluctant to invest in troubled Mexican farming. 
</P>
<P>
 But the most serious indictment of national politics may be the clauses of the 
agreement -- the great majority -- that are not controversial: Most of the 
government's reply involves promises to provide health care, teachers, 
electricity and clean water. 
</P>
<P>
 These are all services it was supposed to furnish all along. 
</P>
<P>
 The agreement proves the point of Commander Juan, one of the rebel delegates 
to the talks, who said: "The Zapatista National Liberation Army took up arms 
against misery and bad government." 
</P>
<P>
 As one government source observed: "The neglect makes you angry." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the people responsible for the neglect are the same people who 
have delivered the state of Chiapas' votes, election after election, to the 
Institutional Revolutionary Party, or PRI, which has ruled Mexico for six 
decades. 
</P>
<P>
 The redistricting plan in the government proposal would probably put those 
people out of power in an election scheduled for the same day as the 
presidential poll: Aug. 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Combined with the federal election reform now under discussion, those changes 
will increase the pressure on PRI candidate Luis Donaldo Colosio, whose 
campaign is already suffering from two months in the shadow of the Chiapas 
revolt. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite Salinas' repeated statements of support for Colosio, rumors are still 
rampant in the Byzantine corridors of Mexican politics that the candidate who 
registers for the PRI on March 15 will be not Colosio, but the government's 
peace negotiator, Manuel Camacho Solis. 
</P>
<P>
 But beyond the threats of political scheming -- inevitable at any time and 
rampant in an election year -- Salinas appears to be emerging from the conflict 
relatively unscathed. 
</P>
<P>
 No other groups have actually taken up arms, although the threat of "joining 
the Zapatistas" has become a popular cry for everyone with a gripe, from street 
vendors to farmers with loans coming due.

UKRAINE LEADER ARRIVES IN U.S. TO GOOD NEWS: DOUBLING OF AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOYLE McMANUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton, encouraged by Ukraine's agreement to dismantle nuclear 
weapons and its cautious turn toward economic reform, has decided to more than 
double U.S. aid to the strategically important country, officials said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton plans to announce the boost, from $330 million to about $700 million, 
after he has lunch at the White House with visiting Ukrainian President Leonid 
Kravchuk today.  
</P>
<P>
 The quick increase reflects heightened interest by the Clinton Administration 
in Ukraine, the second-largest republic of the former Soviet Union and, with 
more than 1,600 nuclear warheads on its territory, the owner of the world's 
third most powerful atomic arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're bullish on Ukraine," a White House official said. "Kravchuk has made a 
remarkable turnaround in the last few months, on both nuclear weapons and 
economic reform." 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, Ukraine does not look like a sure thing. Its economy is in 
hyper-inflation, the ethnic Russian citizens of its Crimean peninsula have 
voted to secede, and Kravchuk himself -- the one man who seemed able to hold 
the country together -- announced last week that he does not plan to run for 
reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 But the picture may not be as bleak as it looks, U.S. officials insisted. "For 
the first time in two years, we now have a normal relationship with Ukraine, 
and we hope this is the start of something much better," the official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, aides said, the United States needs to help Ukraine precisely because 
it has problems -- and because its collapse could provide an excuse for Russian 
nationalists next door to reassert Moscow's claim to control. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, critics of the Administration have been complaining that the 
President has put too much emphasis on his relationship with Russian President 
Boris N. Yeltsin and too little on the other post-Soviet republics. "This 
should make senators of both parties feel better," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Kravchuk, on his three-day stay in Washington, will not get one thing he 
wanted: stronger assurances that the United States and the West will guarantee 
Ukraine's security against Russian military attacks or economic pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton promised him assurances when he stopped in the Ukrainian capital of 
Kiev in January to collect Kravchuk's agreement to dismantle his nuclear 
arsenal. But Kravchuk still has not succeeded in getting his Parliament to 
ratify the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty, as Clinton asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the aid increase to be announced today was unveiled in January. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials have scraped more millions of dollars together for Kravchuk's 
visit, including a major increase in the funds available to help dismantle the 
nuclear arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
 Kravchuk arrived in Washington on Thursday. His delegation included Olympic 
figure skating champion Oksana Baiul, a Ukrainian, who is to meet Clinton 
today.

YELTSIN TALKS TOUGH ON CRIME; DON'T FLOUT AMNESTY, FOES TOLD; RUSSIA: EMBATTLED 
LEADER FAULTS HIS GOVERNMENT AND COURTS FOR ALLOWING CRIMINALS TO RAMPAGE WITH 
IMPUNITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SONNI EFRON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bruised by recent political disaster, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin 
reprimanded his administration Thursday for failing to act decisively against 
organized crime and warned his political foes that they will find themselves 
back behind bars if they step out of line. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking fit and ready for a fight, Yeltsin took the unusual step of summoning 
television cameras to a meeting of the Russian National Security Council to put 
his enemies on notice. 
</P>
<P>
 "If those granted amnesty by the Duma decision start any activities 
threatening Russia's security, they will again be arrested in accordance with 
the law," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reinforcing the get-tough theme he struck in his State of the Nation speech to 
Parliament last week, Yeltsin warned of a "consolidation" of organized crime 
and faulted his government's ineffective law enforcement and court systems for 
allowing criminals to rampage with impunity. 
</P>
<P>
 His move seemed aimed at showing himself strong and determined after a series 
of political setbacks that have left many wondering whether Yeltsin is losing 
control of the government. 
</P>
<P>
 He has had a hellish two weeks. He was outmaneuvered by the conservative Duma, 
or lower house of Parliament, which declared an amnesty for the hard-liners who 
tried to topple the government in 1991 and 1993. Worse, Yeltsin was 
mouse-trapped by his very own, vaunted constitution, which made the amnesty 
legal. 
</P>
<P>
 Next, two trusted aides refused to carry out Yeltsin's orders to delay the 
hard-liners' release from prison. 
</P>
<P>
 After Former Supreme Soviet Chairman Ruslan I. Khasbulatov walked out of jail 
Saturday, he declared himself disgusted with politics. 
</P>
<P>
 But fired Vice President Alexander V. Rutskoi immediately let it be known 
through aides that he plans to run for president in 1996. The former Afghan War 
hero, who grew an Old Testament-style beard during his five months in Lefortovo 
prison, called for peace and national accord and promised to "do my utmost to 
prevent enmity and antagonism." 
</P>
<P>
 Rutskoi has not elaborated on his plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the parliamentary amnesty, on Wednesday a court dismissed proceedings 
against the hard-line leaders accused of plotting to overthrow Soviet leader 
Mikhail S. Gorbachev in August, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 It was an ignominious historical footnote to Yeltsin's finest moment, when he 
climbed atop a tank in front of the White House to defy the Communist junta. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 2 1/2 years later, the trial of the putschists had disintegrated 
into a soapbox from which Yeltsin's enemies denounced him for destroying the 
Soviet Union and wrecking the Russian economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the dismissal of the treason case against the coup-plotters was a 
symbolic blow to a president who can ill afford more bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 "The situation is beginning to smell not of elections in 1996, but of 
gunpowder and bloodshed here and now," said gloomy economic guru Yegor T. 
Gaidar in a newspaper interview Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the president was clobbered on the domestic front, he fared only a little 
better on the international stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Moscow scored a victory for its newly assertive foreign policy by persuading 
Radovan Karadzic, the visiting Bosnian Serb leader, to agree to reopen the 
Tuzla airport to humanitarian shipments. 
</P>
<P>
 But relations with the West have worsened because of the Aldrich H. Ames 
espionage case and its acrimonious aftermath. The damage continued to pile up 
Thursday, when the Federal Counterintelligence Service disclosed yet another, 
though far less significant, espionage arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the agency said Thursday that it had arrested two men for 
allegedly trying to sell the United States secrets about a top-secret T-82 tank 
manufactured at the Uralvagonzavod plant in the Ural Mountains city of Nizhny 
Tagil. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the men contacted a U.S. Embassy official, identified as Kelli Ann 
Hamilton, in Moscow in January, 1993, and offered to sell her secrets, 
spokesman Alexander G. Mikhailov said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the case against the two men was dropped in December, 1993, after they 
confessed and after it was determined that their actions had not damaged 
Russian national security, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia's hard economic times have triggered "a whole flow of such proposals" 
to trade information for hard currency, Mikhailov said. "In a country that is 
big, but hungry and poor, patriotism is difficult."

GERMANS PRESSED TO ADOPT ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAWS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARJORIE MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Germans must accept that their country has become a melting pot with at least 
6.5 million immigrants, and they must adopt anti-discrimination laws to fight 
racism, the government's representative for immigrant affairs said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite a number of fatal extreme-rightist attacks on foreigners in recent 
years, immigrants are moving to Germany in growing numbers and staying longer, 
Cornelia Schmalz-Jacobson, the representative for the interests of foreigners, 
told reporters. "We should recognize that we are an immigrant country," 
Schmalz-Jacobson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Issuing her first in-depth report, "The Situation of Foreigners in Germany," 
she said that more than half of all immigrants have lived in Germany for at 
least a decade; 25% have been here for more than 20 years. 
</P>
<P>
 For that reason, she said, Germans should quit calling them foreigners and 
start referring to them by what she called the more acceptable term migrants . 
</P>
<P>
 Immigrants have been assimilating into German society over the last 20 years, 
climbing the educational and professional ladders and marrying Germans in 
ever-greater numbers. Yet they remain subject to discrimination in housing, 
jobs, insurance coverage and even entrance to restaurants and discotheques. 
</P>
<P>
 Her report says anti-discrimination laws "could bring fundamental 
improvements" in these areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Violent attacks on foreigners have decreased in recent months, but 
Schmalz-Jacobson said that, according to a government poll, almost half of all 
immigrants live in fear of such an attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is intolerable for a democratic country that a part of the population has 
to worry for their lives," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 She renewed her longstanding call for a liberalization of Germany's 
citizenship laws. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign-born adults now must live in Germany for 15 years before they may seek 
citizenship; children born in Germany of foreign parents must wait 10 years and 
relinquish any other citizenship. 
</P>
<P>
 Schmalz-Jacobson's report states that it represents her own views as an 
adviser to Chancellor Helmut Kohl and that of the center-right coalition that 
has ruled Germany for 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 The government's figure of 6.5 million legal immigrants -- 8% of the 
population -- is from 1992 and presumably is larger now. 
</P>
<P>
 The government also estimates that there are 300,000 illegal immigrants in 
Germany -- a figure some consider low.

U.N. OFFICIALS URGE MORE BOSNIA TROOPS; BALKANS: MILITARY, CIVILIAN LEADERS 
PLEAD FOR A DOUBLING OF FORCE. CEASE-FIRE IN SARAJEVO AT RISK, THEY SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANICA KIRKA and CAROL J. WILLIAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The civilian and military heads of the U.N. peacekeeping mission for the 
Balkans appealed Thursday for a near doubling of the troops deployed to 
Bosnia-Herzegovina, warning that a precarious cease-fire in Sarajevo could 
collapse without swift reinforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 As Sarajevo endured scattered mortar and machine-gun fire in violation of a 
U.N.-brokered truce that is 3 weeks old, Yasushi Akashi, the U.N. Protection 
Force chief, called on the United States and other NATO countries to send 
10,650 troops, 500 civilian police and 150 military observers to bolster the 
12,000 U.N. troops already in Bosnia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This window of opportunity which has opened in Bosnia-Herzegovina, including 
Sarajevo after so many months of efforts and anxiety, might close in the 
absence of additional resources," Akashi warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Gen. Jean Cot, the French military commander of the 29,000-strong U.N. 
Protection Force, targeted the United States in his appeal for troops that 
could be deployed quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I need is to have troops available immediately, and those nations which 
are in a position to send troops immediately can be counted on the fingers of 
one hand," Cot said, apparently referring to the United States, Britain and 
France. "As for the rest, it's dreaming. It's for next year." 
</P>
<P>
 The appeals by Akashi and Cot were directed at the United States, which has 
repeatedly stated it will not send ground troops to Bosnia unless a peace 
agreement is negotiated and endorsed by all three warring factions. Cot 
criticized the American position as "not very courageous." 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, Cot redeployed hundreds of troops that had been patrolling 
Serbian-occupied areas of Croatia and Bosnia into Sarajevo as a stopgap measure 
to monitor compliance with a NATO ultimatum that all heavy artillery be 
withdrawn by Feb. 21 from a 12-mile radius of the Bosnian capital, be placed 
under U.N. control or face punitive air strikes. 
</P>
<P>
 Cot stressed that the redeployments were an emergency measure and warned that 
leaving the troops' original posts uncovered invited a rekindling of fighting 
in those areas and a general escalation of the Balkan conflict. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did what one does in case of a fire: We sent people there as quickly as we 
could," Cot said. "But this also means taking away troops from Croatia . . . 
which could imply some risks that could not be borne for too long." 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the reassignment of almost 1,000 more troops to the Bosnian capital, 
where 3,000 U.N. peacekeepers operate a humanitarian airlift and observer 
mission, the job of securing and dismantling the hundreds of Serbian artillery 
pieces still within the exclusion zone has overwhelmed the U.N. mission. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasing numbers of cease-fire breaches have been reported each day over the 
last week, posing the risk of a return to artillery shelling of the capital 
where more than 10,000 people have been killed since Serbs began their armed 
rebellion against Bosnian independence in March, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 So desperate was the appeal for reinforcements that Akashi said the United 
Nations is now willing to accept troops from Turkey and other countries 
previously deemed to be too burdened with historical or religious ties to the 
region. 
</P>
<P>
 Turkey had offered to send troops in the past, but objections were raised by 
Serbian rebel forces that continue to resent that country for its 500-year 
occupation of the Balkans and accuse it of partiality toward Bosnian Muslims. 
</P>
<P>
 "We should not be as stringent as we used to be as to choice of nations," 
Akashi said. In Washington, State Department spokesman Mike McCurry said there 
is no change in the Administration's refusal to send ground troops to Bosnia 
before the warring factions agree to a durable peace.

BACKLASH AGAINST ARAFAT SWEEPS OCCUPIED WEST BANK, GAZA; MIDEAST: PALESTINIAN 
ANGER IS DIRECTED AS MUCH AT THE PLO CHAIRMAN AS AT ISRAEL AND THE SETTLER WHO 
KILLED 48 MUSLIMS.

 Carrying Palestinian flags and black banners to mourn the massacre of 48 
Palestinians last week in a Hebron mosque, the 400 youths moved in a phalanx 
through the main street here Thursday, chanting, "Arafat, Arafat, where is your 
peace? Arafat, Arafat, where is your peace?" 
</P>
<P>
 Their anger was directed as much at Yasser Arafat, chairman of the Palestine 
Liberation Organization, as it was at Israel and the Jewish settler who had 
gunned down the Muslims as they prayed. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat, Arafat, they are killing us!" they repeated in rhythmic Arabic. 
"Arafat, Arafat, they are killing us! Arafat, Arafat, why are you deceiving us? 
Arafat, Arafat, you are killing us!" 
</P>
<P>
 An emotional backlash is sweeping the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip a week 
after the Hebron massacre, and the Palestinian rage that first focused upon the 
Israeli occupiers and Jewish settlers is now trained upon Arafat, once the 
unifying symbol of Palestinian politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mood is ugly after this atrocity, as you would expect, but not really in 
the ways you would expect," Mahmoud Abdul Fattah, a local grocer, said as he 
watched soldiers disperse the noisy demonstration with volleys of tear gas 
grenades. "People want to go out and kill settlers in revenge, or so they say, 
but they also want to kill Arafat. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "Why is Arafat to blame for the massacre? Sure, he didn't pull the trigger -- 
a Jewish settler did -- but Arafat failed to prevent it. He promised us peace, 
if we put down our arms and accepted this agreement. But we are getting more 
deaths. People have lost faith in Arafat, in the agreement, in the whole peace 
process. It has all failed." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the massacre, doubts were growing among Palestinians about 
Arafat's deal with Israel on self-government for the Gaza Strip and later for 
the West Bank. As the autonomy plans became bogged down in tedious 
negotiations, the doubts hardened into bitter cynicism and a strong resentment 
of Arafat, who was seen as giving in again and again to Israeli demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "The massacre lets the critics say, 'We told you so,' and supporters then have 
to agree -- it is as simple as that," said Jamal Aboulhawa, a high school 
science teacher. "How can those who supported the agreement as the road to 
peace argue against this? How can they believe themselves? Everyone feels 
betrayed, first of all by Arafat." 
</P>
<P>
 This anger, evident throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, will make it 
even harder for Arafat to reach the compromises necessary to implement the 
original agreement, local political leaders say; the popular demand now is for 
major Palestinian gains, such as dismantling some Israeli settlements, as an 
immediate goal, should negotiations resume. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are sick and tired of us talking peace," senior PLO negotiator Saeb 
Erekat commented. "They want something. . . . Any negotiations that don't have 
the future of the Israeli settlements high on the agenda will be senseless." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Zakaria Agha, the Gaza leader of Fatah, the principal group within the 
PLO, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The most important thing is to cut out these cancerous settlements," Agha 
said. "After the massacre in Hebron, this is the No. 1 issue for our people, 
and no Palestinian negotiator can ignore it. In Gaza, we are losing the street 
to those opposed to the peace process." 
</P>
<P>
 But other Palestinian observers argue that the sheer volatility of the 
political mood could quickly restore faith in Arafat and support for the 
autonomy agreement -- if there were significant gains in negotiations with 
Israel. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Arafat will get a few pennies from Israel and then maybe some dollars -- 
real ones -- from the U.S. and Europe, he can turn everything around 
overnight," Jerusalem businessman Nabil Feidy said. "With $200 million, Arafat 
can have a construction program that will put everyone to work in Gaza, and he 
will be a hero again." 
</P>
<P>
 Israeli leaders, taking the shifts into account, appear to have decided that 
Arafat does indeed need help. But not too much and not too soon. Under Israeli 
calculations, the promise of compromises on key issues should bring Arafat back 
to negotiations in two weeks or so -- after Eid-al-Fitr, the feast that ends 
the Islamic holy month of Ramadan. The negotiations then, they say, must be 
wrapped up quickly, even at the cost of substantial Israeli concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Arafat is a survivor, and we need him to survive this crisis too," a senior 
Israeli official said. "But he is in real trouble on the street. How far (Prime 
Minister Yitzhak) Rabin is willing to go, I don't know. But Arafat is the 
partner in this venture, the only partner Rabin has." 
</P>
<P>
 A more immediate worry is Fatah's loss of control over street-level politics, 
for it could lead, local PLO leaders say, to the formation of secret cells 
intent on avenging those murdered in Hebron with attacks on Jewish settlers, 
or, worse, renewing the armed struggle against the Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 "Until the massacre, we were able to maintain sufficient political discipline 
so that, with a couple of exceptions, there were no attacks by Fatah on 
Israelis," a PLO official here commented. "I cannot guarantee that any longer. 
On the contrary, I expect such attacks." 
</P>
<P>
 The radicalization of Palestinian politics is already evident. When Faisal 
Husseini, the Fatah leader on the West Bank, came to Hebron to offer 
condolences to bereaved families, he met open hostility. When he tried to calm 
angry crowds at Jerusalem's Al Aqsa Mosque, he was stoned. 
</P>
<P>
 In Hebron, Fatah and the Islamic Resistance Movement, known as Hamas, ended 
their rivalry after the massacre; a similar trend is developing in the Gaza 
Strip and other parts of the West Bank as moderates and radicals re-establish 
the unified leadership structure they used through most of the intifada, the 
six-year rebellion against the Israeli occupation. 
</P>
<P>
 Daoud Kuttab, a prominent Palestinian commentator, said the PLO leadership's 
greatest fear is that a radical faction -- perhaps Marxist, more likely Islamic 
-- will execute a daring military operation that will pull away Fatah's 
remaining supporters. "This situation demands that the Palestinian leadership 
realize two aims at the same time," Kuttab said. "First, to find a way of 
gathering the Palestinians under its canopy. Second, to find tangible solutions 
to bring back the feeling of security and guarantee that such massacres will 
not be repeated." 
</P>
<P>
 That is the point, Kuttab argued, of the three conditions that the PLO set in 
Tunis for resumption of the negotiations with Israel: disarming the settlers, 
removing settlements in Palestinian population centers and stationing 
international observers on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

RABIN TALKS TO RIGHT WING TO STRENGTHEN COALITION; MIDEAST: ISRAELI LEADER SAYS 
MASSACRE WEAKENED GOVERNMENT. BUT TSOMET PARTY OPPOSES PLO AGREEMENT ON 
SELF-RULE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin said Thursday that he is negotiating with the 
right-wing Tsomet Party in an effort to broaden his coalition government, even 
though the party opposes the agreement he signed with the Palestine Liberation 
Organization on Palestinian self-government. 
</P>
<P>
 "I see it as an urgent necessity to broaden the coalition basis of the 
government, and I intend to take action to reach that goal," Rabin declared, 
asserting the massacre of 48 Palestinians in a Hebron mosque last week left his 
minority government even weaker than before. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Tsomet's incorporation in the Cabinet would bring the government five 
more seats in Parliament, giving it a one-vote majority, the party's staunch 
opposition to the autonomy agreement and to withdrawal from any occupied 
territory would throw into question Rabin's ability, even his willingness, to 
proceed with peace negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 The left-wing Meretz Party, a member of the governing coalition with Rabin's 
Labor Party, voiced its strong objections to Tsomet and threatened to pull out 
if Rabin brought it into the Cabinet. 
</P>
<P>
 Founded in 1987, Tsomet is committed to holding all of the biblical Land of 
Israel, to increasing Israeli settlements on the occupied West Bank and to a 
tougher line on security issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the severe circumstances that developed following the massacre in Hebron, 
Tsomet's joining (the government) will be seen as a negative message to our 
Palestinian partners in negotiations, to Israeli Arabs . . . and to the peace 
process in general and its chances for advancing," Meretz warned. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin said the coalition needed a "strong base" and it was "unthinkable" 
for crucial decisions on peace to be made by a minority government. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabin now has 56 of 120 members of the Knesset, Israel's Parliament, in his 
coalition; 44 come from Labor, 12 from Meretz. Five legislators from Arab and 
Communist parties outside the government also back him. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Hebron massacre makes reliance on as wide as possible a coalition in 
Parliament all the more important," Foreign Minister Shimon Peres said. "We are 
talking about Tsomet joining, in effect without changing the (government's) 
guidelines. We will definitely regard this as an important and welcome 
addition." 
</P>
<P>
 Ahmed Tibi, a senior adviser to PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, nonetheless warned 
that Tsomet's inclusion in the Cabinet would "cast a shadow over the future of 
the peace process" and would run counter to the basic agreement between Israel 
and the PLO. 
</P>
<P>
 Tsomet leader Rafael Eitan is best-known as the army chief of staff who led 
Israel's 1982 invasion of Lebanon, a campaign now regarded as a disastrous 
military adventure. He has opposed any withdrawal from territory -- whether the 
West Bank, Golan Heights or Gaza Strip -- that Israel captured in the 1967 
Middle East War. 
</P>
<P>
 Before retiring from the army in 1983, Eitan boasted to a parliamentary 
committee: "When we have settled the land, all the Arabs will be able to do 
about it will be to scurry around like drugged cockroaches in a bottle." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Israeli press reports of the negotiations with Rabin, Eitan would 
become police minister in charge of Israel's internal security. He would accept 
the accord on Palestinian self-government with the explanation that he could 
better serve Israel now by joining the Cabinet to ensure minimal damage was 
done in its implementation. 
</P>
<P>
 But Rabin's discussions with Eitan may be a feint to force Meretz to make 
compromises necessary to lure Shas, an ultra-Orthodox religious party, back 
into the government where it has opposed liberal human rights legislation that 
is a Meretz priority. 
</P>
<P>
 "We in Meretz are committed to this government, and this government has done 
many great things for peace," Environment Minister Yossi Sarid said. "It still 
has great challenges ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 "We must be able to distinguish between what's important and what's less 
important," Sarid continued, suggesting that Meretz was prepared for 
compromises on key issues, such as women's rights, where it quarreled with 
Shas. 
</P>
<P>
 Arye Deri, the Shas leader who resigned from the Cabinet when indicted for 
corruption, confidently predicted Thursday evening that not only his party 
would return to the government within a week but that a small, three-member 
parliamentary group that recently split from Tsomet would also join, leaving 
Tsomet in the opposition. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Israel released 400 more Palestinian prisoners in a goodwill 
gesture intended to halt the violent protests that followed the Hebron mosque 
massacre and to persuade the PLO to return to the negotiations on implementing 
the autonomy agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 But B'Tselem, a leading Israel human rights group, accused the army of 
arresting nearly as many Palestinians as it freed in suppressing anti-Israeli 
demonstrations on the West Bank and Gaza Strip. 
</P>
<P>
 About 40 people were injured Thursday in clashes with troops.  
</P>
<P>
 Israeli authorities also continued their crackdown on extremist Jewish 
settlers, issuing orders for the detention of five more of their leaders and 
banning 18 others from entering Palestinian areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Settler leaders declared that they will not turn in their army-issued weapons 
if ordered and will resist other measures against them.

JAPANESE LAWMAKERS FINALIZE ENACTMENT OF POLITICAL REFORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SAM JAMESON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With the support of Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa's coalition and 
opposition Liberal Democrats, Parliament's upper house today made final the 
enactment of Japan's most drastic political reforms since the post-World War II 
occupation era. 
</P>
<P>
 The laws enacted today fill in enforcement dates omitted from an 
eleventh-hour, stop-gap passage of the bills Jan. 29. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to favor larger parties, the new system is expected to force an 
amalgamation of the hodgepodge of 10 political parties that now exist into two 
or three groups and facilitate changes of government. 
</P>
<P>
 Until rebels bolted the Liberal Democratic Party last summer, the former 
ruling party had held power for 38 years. 
</P>
<P>
 One more step remains before a general election can be conducted under the new 
system, which provides for voters in each district to elect a single 
representative, instead of an average of four, to the lower house. Parliament 
must approve a bill establishing boundaries for 300 single-seat districts, to 
be drawn up in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 In all, the new lower house will have 500 seats, with voters casting a second 
ballot for political parties to choose 200 seats through proportional 
representation. 
</P>
<P>
 In exchange for limiting annual corporate donations to individual politicians 
to $4,800, the government, for the first time, will donate $297 million each 
year to political parties in proportion to the seats they hold in the lower 
house. 
</P>
<P>
 The new system should be ready to go by early next year. Should Hosokawa 
dissolve the lower house before then -- an action that is not expected -- 
balloting would be conducted under the old system of multi-seat districts.

SOMALIA CASTS SHADOW ON U.S. FOREIGN POLICY; AFRICA: ANALYSTS SAY THE MISSION 
MAY PROVE AN EXCEPTION TO THE PATTERN OF U.S. ACTION ABROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBIN WRIGHT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The U.S. intervention in Somalia, once heralded as a sequel to the Persian 
Gulf War against Iraq in shaping the new world order, may turn out instead to 
be the exception rather than a precedent for U.S. policy in the post-Cold War 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 In a low-key, anticlimactic end to the lifesaving drama launched by President 
George Bush 14 months ago under the glare of television lights, the United 
States on Tuesday began the final month of withdrawing its troops. 
</P>
<P>
 The Defense Department says it hopes to have virtually all American ground 
forces -- 3,273 of them were still left as of Thursday -- out of the country by 
March 25, six days before the deadline set by Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 The haunting initial images of stick-thin women and children have been 
replaced by pictures of dead American soldiers dragged through the streets of 
Mogadishu. And the anarchy and wanton violence that elicited intervention in 
the first place appear to be returning now that U.S. and European troops are 
leaving. 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the Somali experience has become Exhibit A in the case for staying 
out of foreign quarrels, no matter how heart-rending. 
</P>
<P>
 It is casting shadows over U.S. intervention in Bosnia-Herzegovina and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will clearly influence and make the United States more reluctant about 
decisions to undertake missions of this kind elsewhere in the world,' former 
Defense Secretary Frank Carlucci said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most analysts differentiate, however, between the U.S.-led Operation Restore 
Hope, a humanitarian mission that lasted five months, and the subsequent 
U.N.-directed operation, which pursued more ambitious goals over the last nine 
months. 
</P>
<P>
 "In terms of the humanitarian mission, I'd say it achieved its initial 
purpose," Carlucci said. "But when the mandate changed to nation-building -- an 
impossible task, especially for a multilateral organization -- I'd have to give 
it an 'F.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Mohammed Sahnoun, U.N. envoy to Somalia before the U.S. intervention, agreed 
that Operation Restore Hope succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 "It established a security framework for emergency relief and demonstrated 
that a well-organized endeavor by the United States for humanitarian purposes 
can have a positive impact," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Somalia also offers several other lessons: 
</P>
<P>
 * Overseas missions need more precisely defined goals. 
</P>
<P>
 This was easy during the Cold War, when most foreign operations centered on 
the singular goal of containing Communist influence. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, Somalia symbolizes the absence of answers to basic questions, 
including long-term U.S. goals and the boundaries and rules of intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somalia was set up for failure by the terms of reference," former U.N. 
Ambassador Donald McHenry said. "Anyone who was naive enough to believe we 
could go in and simply feed people and then pull out was fooling themselves. To 
follow that course would have ensured the same conditions that forced us to go 
in would reoccur." 
</P>
<P>
 When the United States intervened in Somalia, analysts said, it failed to look 
ahead to how it would get out. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need greater selectivity and care in defining missions and to make sure 
they're finite," said Robert Oakley, U.S. special envoy for Somalia and a 
former ambassador to that country. 
</P>
<P>
 * The United Nations cannot be counted on as an alternative or fall-back when 
unilateral involvement does not work, and the United States and United Nations 
must redefine their relationship to fit the post-Cold War world. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somalia was the first test for U.N. leadership in these kinds of crises of 
failed states, and it overreached," Oakley said. "The objective in Somalia 
became too encompassing and too intrusive and more than the United Nations 
could handle." 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, the United Nations has launched 17 peacekeeping missions around 
the world, compared with 13 during the entire four decades of the Cold War. Its 
capacities, manpower and finances are now stretched thin. 
</P>
<P>
 The stickiest issue in the U.S.-U.N. relationship is an international force. 
</P>
<P>
 "If we don't want to be the policemen of the world, and we don't want to take 
criticism for the failure of action in places like Somalia or Bosnia, then we 
have to come up with some kind of credible international force as an 
alternative," McHenry said. 
</P>
<P>
 This means that the United States must face up to such uncomfortable 
situations as putting U.S. forces under foreign command and contributing to a 
U.N. reserve fund to meet crises as they develop, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, he added, the United States is blocking movement toward an 
international force, even though such a force is in the U.S. interest. 
</P>
<P>
 * The longer the delay in doing something about the kind of crises represented 
by Somalia, the higher the costs. 
</P>
<P>
 "In these kinds of crises, the international community needs to get in early," 
said Michael Clough, senior fellow at the Council on Foreign Relations. 
"Somalia would never have happened if attention had been paid at the time 
(former President Mohamed Siad) Barre fell in 1990. Everyone saw the total 
collapse of order coming. But everyone cut and ran. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it would have taken is a little serious political involvement and sending 
the right signals to the players on the ground. Instead, the reverse message 
was sent: Fight it out and whoever wins gets to be the government. So it took 
off." 
</P>
<P>
 * As cases of crumbling states increase, the United States should not be seen 
to take sides. 
</P>
<P>
 The neutrality of the U.S.-dominated U.N. force was compromised after 
confrontations between U.N. troops and gunmen believed to be supporters of 
Somali warlord Mohammed Farah Aidid. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. envoy Jonathan Howe, a retired U.S. admiral and former deputy national 
security adviser to Bush, ordered an ultimately unsuccessful manhunt for Aidid, 
complete with a reward. 
</P>
<P>
 Singling out Aidid, Sahnoun said, inadvertently boosted his image and 
following within Somalia and changed the dimensions of the operation. And the 
U.N. mission was seen to be assuming sovereign powers rather than allowing 
Somalis to judge and settle their problems. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the post-Cold War world, U.S. leadership or preeminence can be a 
liability in high-profile military operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to have to play a major role," McHenry said. "But to the extent 
the operation is seen as an American operation, we will be the one embroiled in 
political difficulties when they arise, whether internationally or locally."

CIA'S MOLE PLOT OPENS LAYERS OF DECEIT; ESPIONAGE: TAKE THE BIZARRE CASE OF KGB 
DEFECTOR YURCHENKO. HE WAS DEBRIEFED BY AMES. DID THEY KNOW THAT WE KNEW . . . 
THEN THEY . . . ? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It was at the same time one of the CIA's greatest Cold War coups and most 
humbling embarrassments, and it has only been recently, after nearly a decade, 
that the agency has managed to come to terms with it. 
</P>
<P>
 But now, with the arrest of a suspected CIA mole for the Russians, the bizarre 
case of KGB defector Vitaly Yurchenko is posing a new riddle for the 
international intelligence community, provoking tormented speculation and 
re-examination of what really happened. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and counterintelligence experts are checking out the newest twist for 
signs that there may have been another hidden layer of deceit in this John Le 
Carre-style mystery. 
</P>
<P>
 Was Vitaly Yurchenko a defector who had second thoughts? Was he a 
double-agent? Or was he some more complicated mutation? 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you start back down this road, it becomes: 'If they knew what we knew or 
thought we knew, then they. . . .' And it does sound like Le Carre," says one 
former senior U.S. intelligence official. 
</P>
<P>
 This former official still believes that Yurchenko was a genuine defector who 
changed his mind and returned to the Soviet Union. But he concedes that the 
discovery of accused CIA mole Aldrich H. Ames, who dealt with Yurchenko after 
his defection, is prompting second thoughts. 
</P>
<P>
 In August, 1985, Yurchenko, a KGB colonel with direct knowledge of spies 
working in the United States and Canada for the Soviets, defected to the U.S. 
Embassy in Rome. CIA Director William J. Casey hailed it as a huge intelligence 
windfall. 
</P>
<P>
 In CIA debriefing sessions, Yurchenko provided information that led to the 
discovery of two spies who had turned over vital intelligence secrets to the 
U.S.S.R. 
</P>
<P>
 One was former National Security Agency employee Ronald W. Pelton, who now is 
serving a life sentence for informing the Soviets that the United States had 
secretly broken into a main undersea communications cable. 
</P>
<P>
 The other was Edward Lee Howard, a former CIA operative who had been trained 
for assignment in Moscow and had knowledge of highly sensitive sources and 
methods. After the agency decided not to send Howard, he managed to elude FBI 
pursuers and, relying on his CIA training, made his way to Moscow, where he now 
lives. 
</P>
<P>
 Yurchenko, however, became unhappy with his treatment by the agency, which was 
pressing him for further information. He also was disappointed over the failure 
of a romantic liaison with the wife of a Soviet diplomat in Canada -- an affair 
that the agency had tried to facilitate. Dining at a French restaurant in 
trendy Georgetown, Yurchenko left behind his CIA guard and made his way to a 
Soviet compound a mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 He later charged he had been kidnaped, tortured and drugged by the CIA and 
that the story of the spurned love affair was a CIA fabrication. 
</P>
<P>
 Exhaustive intelligence assessments of the baffling affair and any Soviet 
gambit it may have involved now are being tested by the arrest of Ames, a 
31-year veteran of the CIA, on espionage conspiracy charges. As chief of the 
agency's Soviet counterintelligence branch in the Sovet-East European division, 
Ames took part in debriefing Yurchenko. At the same time, however, Ames is 
suspected to have begun spying for the Soviets. 
</P>
<P>
 The discovery of Ames' suspected role raises the possibility that he fed his 
alleged Soviet handlers the information that Yurchenko revealed in the 
debriefing sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 It also raises questions about whether Yurchenko, because he had been a Soviet 
spymaster, knew that he was being questioned by a recently enlisted KGB spy. If 
so, why didn't Yurchenko finger Ames, as he did Pelton and Howard? 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of Yurchenko's defection, a former counterintelligence official 
recalled, "there was a theory that he came here to take us off the scent" of an 
agency mole. 
</P>
<P>
 Yurchenko told CIA questioners that he knew of no CIA mole other than 
"Robert," which turned out to be the code name for Howard, who had left the 
CIA. Thus, Yurchenko could have been trying to lead U.S. counterspies away from 
Ames by giving them clues to spies who had already outlived their usefulness. 
</P>
<P>
 A former senior intelligence agency official said that Yurchenko could have 
been deliberately "holding back" on revealing Ames' suspected spying. 
</P>
<P>
 "This (exposing a well-placed mole in the CIA) is his currency," the 
ex-official said. "Once we have it, (a defecting spy) can't set the price any 
more. When you run out of assets, you've lost your clout," the former official 
said. "I don't find that inconsistent with (his) being a bona fide defector." 
</P>
<P>
 But the ex-counterintelligence official, who declined to be identified, said 
that he did not then and does not now buy the theory that Yurchenko was a 
deliberate plant to mislead U.S. counterspies. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather, he favors the explanation that Yurchenko -- who government sources 
said was never alone with Ames -- did not know he was being questioned by a 
Soviet mole. 
</P>
<P>
 A former senior official with knowledge of the case said it is entirely 
plausible that he did not know. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's do a mirror-image analysis," he said. "If we had an agent like Ames 
(working as a KGB mole), there would be no more than three or four people in 
the entire agency who would know his identity. I mean, that would be the crown 
jewel." 
</P>
<P>
 A former intelligence official said it could be that Ames had not yet been 
"tasked" -- given the KGB's wish list for his spying -- by the Soviets and that 
his existence was "so closely held in the KGB that only a very few people 
knew." 
</P>
<P>
 Or it could have been that Ames' bona fides had not yet been established to 
the Soviets' satisfaction, who were concerned about his being a "dangle," a 
double-agent still loyal to the United States and seeking to gather information 
about Soviet operations. 
</P>
<P>
 The FBI complaint and affidavit allege that Ames and his wife, Rosario, began 
their espionage conspiracy in 1985 but the documents did not specify a month. 
Yurchenko stayed only three months in the United States that year, re-defecting 
in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The detention hearing Tuesday for the couple shed no light on when they may 
have begun spying.

FOSTER FILE AT ROSE FIRM REPORTED SHREDDED 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A courier for the Rose Law Firm in Little Rock, Ark., said in secret testimony 
that he was told to destroy a box of documents from the files of the late White 
House lawyer Vincent Foster, the New York Times reported in today's editions. 
</P>
<P>
 Quoting unidentified people familiar with the testimony, the newspaper said 
the employee told a federal grand jury Feb. 16 that he and a colleague used an 
office shredding machine in late January to destroy papers from Foster's 
file.The request to do so came from a clerk at the firm, the unidentified 
courier was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
 The courier said that he did not know precisely what he had shredded but that 
the papers were separated by binders marked with the initials "VWF," the firm's 
abbreviation for Foster, the newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
 It said the Rose firm denied in a statement that any of Foster's papers had 
been shredded.

VIRGINIA HOUSE OPPOSES STATE SONG 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By The Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a symbolic break with the past, the Virginia House of Delegates voted 87 to 
9 Thursday to repeal "Carry Me Back to Old Virginia" as the official state song 
because of its racially offensive lyrics. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was a milestone in the former capital of the Confederacy.After more 
than two decades of debating the propriety of a song that waxes nostalgic about 
the days of antebellum slavery, neither house of the General Assembly had ever 
agreed to do away with it until Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The House version now goes to the Senate, where its fate is unclear. Last 
month the Senate voted to rewrite the lyrics to remove some troubling words, 
but black lawmakers Thursday said that was not good enough.

CLEAVER MAY HAVE BEEN BEATEN, ROBBED, POLICE SAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Former Black Panther Party leader Eldridge Cleaver, who remains in serious 
condition in a hospital here, may have suffered his serious brain injury during 
a robbery and assault, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Berkeley police, who arrested the critically acclaimed author on drug charges 
Tuesday, said his wallet, watch, keys and 1977 Chevrolet pickup are missing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been investigating the suspicious circumstances of this case, and we 
believe one possibility is that he was the victim of a crime," Lt. Michel de 
Latour said. 
</P>
<P>
 Best known for his book "Soul on Ice," Cleaver, 58, was taken to the hospital 
early Tuesday after he fell ill while being booked on suspicion of public 
intoxication and possession of cocaine and drug paraphernalia. 
</P>
<P>
 He underwent five hours of emergency surgery at Alta Bates Medical Center. He 
regained consciousness on Thursday, but doctors say it is still too early to 
make a prognosis. 
</P>
<P>
 A CAT scan revealed that Cleaver had a subdural hematoma, a type of brain 
hemorrhage sometimes suffered by boxers. A hospital spokeswoman said such 
injuries can only be caused by some sort of recent trauma, such as a fall or a 
blow to the head. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Cleaver suffered no such trauma during his arrest shortly before 4 
a.m. Tuesday. De Latour said two officers responding to a report of a prowler 
found a dazed Cleaver in the back yard of an apartment, tapping on a window. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was no fighting, no resisting, no confrontation and no contact of any 
kind except to handcuff him," De Latour said. Cleaver was disoriented, spoke 
slowly and had difficulty standing, but he did not complain of head pain or 
have any visible wounds, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty minutes later, Cleaver began vomiting in a detoxification cell. He said 
he was on medication for diabetes, and police, believing that he might be 
having a diabetic reaction, called paramedics. 
</P>
<P>
 De Latour said the department's investigation would continue. 
</P>
<P>
 An ex-convict and one-time presidential candidate, Cleaver joined the Black 
Panthers in 1967.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent years, he has become a Republican and championed landlords' rights 
in Berkeley.

WHITE HOUSE FRENCH CHEF QUITS; MAKES WAY FOR DOMESTIC FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From the Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The White House chef and three other members of the White House kitchen staff 
will resign effective at the end of the month, the First Lady's office said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Neel Lattimore, a spokesman for Hillary Rodham Clinton, said executive chef 
Pierre Chambrin and the three other members of the kitchen staff submitted 
their resignations Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lattimore said Chambrin left because his specialty is French cuisine and the 
Clintons prefer American cooking. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a really wonderful French chef, and when the Clintons came in they said 
they were really going to showcase American cuisine," he said. "Pierre was 
really great and prepared wonderful menus" using American cooking, Lattimore 
said. But "he wanted to give the Clintons an opportunity to have someone whose 
specialty or expertise is American cuisine. His first love is French cuisine." 
</P>
<P>
 Three other members of the kitchen staff also submitted their resignations in 
order to give the new chef an opportunity to put together his own team, 
Lattimore said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lattimore said the pastry operation will continue under the direction of 
Roland Mesnier.

NEW JERSEY SENATE VOTES TO CUT TAXES 5% 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state Senate voted Thursday to cut income taxes by 5% retroactive to the 
beginning of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assembly had already approved the cut, and Gov. Christine Todd Whitman was 
expected to sign it into law on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Whitman said at a news conference after the vote that she has not ruled out 
municipal or school aid cuts in her 1994-95 budget but promised to reduce state 
requirements that drive up towns' and schools' costs. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the tax cut would be funded next year by reductions in government 
operations, but she also must make other cuts to account for $1 billion in 
one-time revenues used this year and $1.2 billion in looming expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Though sharply critical during her campaign of the practice, she said she 
would have to include one-time revenues in her budget.

NORTHEAST GOES 15TH ROUND OF WINTER STORMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Wire Services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The 15th storm to pound the northeastern United States this winter dumped more 
than two feet of snow, snarled air and commuter traffic and cut off New Jersey 
island towns from the mainland Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy snow fell in New England and portions of northern New York and eastern 
Pennsylvania the day after the storm made its way up the Atlantic 
Coast.Burdett, N.Y., had 27 inches of snow on the ground Thursday, while Lock 
Haven and Lovelton in Pennsylvania each received 24 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 New York City received another five inches of snow, putting the season's total 
at 50 inches, the highest snowfall figure in 16 years. 
</P>
<P>
 High storm tides eroded beaches and cut off access to barrier islands on the 
New Jersey shore, leaving Ocean City and other popular summer resort towns cut 
off. The tides also flooded downtown Atlantic City and closed many roads near 
Delaware beaches. 
</P>
<P>
 New York area commuter train lines experienced delays of up to an hour 
Thursday, with one New Jersey line shut down by power problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Air travelers were among the hardest hit. The New York area's three major 
airports, La Guardia, Kennedy and Newark, all experienced flight delays and 
cancellations. About half of the flights were canceled at Philadelphia 
International Airport, and periodic runway closures were reported at Boston's 
Logan Airport because of the storm. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of minor accidents were reported in the Boston area as near-whiteout 
conditions blanketed major highways. Schools were closed across Massachusetts 
and many universities canceled classes. The National Weather Service said up to 
eight inches of snow was expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The previous winter storms have dumped a total of 87.3 inches of snow on 
Boston, and another heavy snowfall would break the record of 89.2 inches set 
during the winter of 1947-48, officials said.

OLYMPIC AUDITORIUM HISTORY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are some key dates in the life of the Olympic Auditorium, which will 
reopen Saturday.

PROMOTER REMEMBERED FOR HER IRON FIST, WARM HEART 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Aileen Eaton did not build it or buy it, but in every other way, the Olympic 
Auditorium was her unchallenged fiefdom. 
</P>
<P>
 She made the Olympic what it was, and it made her who she was. 
</P>
<P>
 "Aileen Eaton was a visionary," says publicist Luis Magana, who worked with 
her during her 38 years at the Olympic. "She was a wonderful woman and she was 
loved by many and hated by many." 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton, who died in 1987, was promoter Cal Eaton's secretary when she noticed 
how poorly the auditorium was being managed and told Eaton that she could do 
better. 
</P>
<P>
 He shocked the local boxing community by hiring her as the building's business 
manager in 1942. Six years later, she had married him, become the Olympic's 
promoter and had boxing and wrestling booming there. 
</P>
<P>
 Aileen Eaton ruled the Olympic with an iron fist and, her longtime employees 
say, a warm heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "She loved boxing and she loved the people in it," says her last matchmaker, 
Don Chargin. "Oh yeah, she was tough. But her toughness was exaggerated a lot. 
She was an easy tough. The amount of fighters and managers she helped was 
amazing." After she retired, she often said launching and developing the career 
of former welterweight champion Carlos Palomino was one of her greatest 
achievements. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Los Angeles Athletic Club put the Olympic up for sale in the 1970s, 
Eaton tried to buy it. But in 1980, the auditorium was sold to developer Jack 
Needleman for $3 million, a price Eaton later said she could have matched if 
the club had allowed her to. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in her 70s, shortly before her retirement and seven or so years before 
her death, Eaton commanded a certain majesty. 
</P>
<P>
 Jack Needleman's son, Steve, now the building's chief executive officer, 
remembers sitting next to her at ringside during a particularly brutal fight. 
</P>
<P>
 "This one kid laid this right cross, and this mouthpiece -- blood, spit, 
everything -- came flying and landed right in her lap," Needleman says. "And 
I'm cringing. I'm having a rough time here. 
</P>
<P>
 "And this woman did not flinch. She picked that thing up and just threw it 
right back into the ring with a big smile on her face." 
</P>
<P>
 As an example of Eaton's influence, the athletic club included a codicil in 
the building sale that forbade Needleman to fire her as promoter without her 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 Eaton retired in 1980 because of declining health. The Olympic was never the 
same.

SUSPECT DENIED BAIL IN ATTACK ON 15 HASIDIM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN J. GOLDMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 28-year-old Lebanese cabdriver was ordered held without bail Thursday after 
being arraigned on 15 counts of attempted murder in an assault on a van packed 
with Hasidic students on the Brooklyn Bridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Two students were gravely wounded in the attack Tuesday and one was declared 
brain-dead by doctors in a Manhattan hospital. Two others in the van received 
lesser wounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Rashad Baz, a Beirut native who entered the United States on a student visa in 
1984, was silent during the arraignment. But law enforcement sources said he 
told detectives that the bloody incident stemmed from a traffic argument and 
that students in the van opened fire on him first. 
</P>
<P>
 The sources said there were witnesses to rebut Baz's version of events. They 
said that the attack on the van was unprovoked and that no traffic incident 
preceded the shooting. Police said Baz fired at the vehicle with two guns, one 
of them an automatic weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 "The district attorney in a rapid attempt to bring this case to a . . . close 
may have arrested the wrong individual," the defendant's lawyer, S. Michael 
Musa-Obregon, charged. 
</P>
<P>
 But prosecutors told Criminal Court Judge Albert D. Koch that Baz was 
identified by witnesses in two lineups and that he had given statements during 
questioning. Koch scheduled a hearing in the case for Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 Two other suspects, Jordanians living in Brooklyn, were held in lieu of 
$20,000 bail on charges of weapons possession and hindering the prosecution of 
a crime. Investigators believe that they helped Baz hide the car and the guns 
used in the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Several callers gave tips that allowed detectives to make arrests in the case 
within 30 hours. A driver who was on the Brooklyn Bridge at the time of the 
incident used a cellular phone to describe what had just happened and how the 
gunman had just shot a window out of his own car. Others on the bridge 
furnished further descriptions of the gunman's auto -- a blue Chevrolet. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, a caller reported seeing the car at a Brooklyn auto repair shop and 
further callers furnished license plate information. Detectives staked out the 
body shop, the private cab service where Baz worked and his home. 
</P>
<P>
 The motive for the attack still was under investigation.

NEWS ANALYSIS; SOME SAY PENALTY PROCESS IMPEDES TRADE TALKS; MARKETS: 
EX-NEGOTIATOR CALLS SUPER 301 A PROVOCATION TO TARGETED NATIONS. BUT OTHERS SEE 
IT AS JUST WHAT IS NEEDED TO SPUR JAPANESE CONCESSIONS.

 The only other time the American government tried to get tough with its 
trading partners through the so-called Super 301 provision of the U.S. trade 
law, the effort backfired and made talks even harder, a George Bush 
Administration negotiator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 That may contain a lesson for the Clinton Administration, which is renewing 
the controversial provision that sets in motion a lengthy process that 
ultimately could result in sanctions against nations that do not open their 
markets to U.S. goods. 
</P>
<P>
 S. Linn Williams, a Washington lawyer and former deputy trade representative, 
said that, when the provision was first invoked in 1989 against Japan, India 
and Brazil, it did not help. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has all of the tools necessary to investigate trade practices 
and remedy them without Super 301," he said. "What it does is add a poke in the 
eye, which in 1989 caused a delay in the negotiating process." 
</P>
<P>
 Trade retaliation "is a club more effective when it's not used than when it 
is," noted Michael Smith, former deputy trade representative in the Ronald 
Reagan and Bush administrations. 
</P>
<P>
 Not everyone agrees. Some experts say Super 301 is just what is needed to spur 
the Japanese into concessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Clyde Prestowitz, president of the Economic Strategy Institute in Washington 
and former counsel to the secretary of commerce under Reagan, argues that Super 
301 succeeded in 1989 and will do so again in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it provides an impetus, creates some pressure for negotiation," he 
said. "Japan may scream about it and others may pound their chests . . . but 
that's largely letting off steam." 
</P>
<P>
 If the provision does lead to U.S. trade sanctions against Japan, it could be 
the opening round of a trade war that would be devastating to two nations whose 
economies are closely intertwined, analysts said. Sanctions, which are at least 
a year away, would likely be in the form of high tariffs or other barriers on 
consumer products made in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Bush Administration invoked the provision in 1989, it never resulted 
in sanctions. Negotiations ended successfully within 12 months, said Williams, 
who was the point man in talks with Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Williams said, he favored the provision as a way to gain leverage 
in negotiations to open Japanese markets to U.S. satellites, supercomputers and 
wood products, to win intellectual property protections in Brazil and to open 
Indian markets to U.S. insurance firms. 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, he said he believes, invoking the provision was unduly 
provocative. The targeted nations protested at having to conduct negotiations 
under duress and Williams said he expended a lot of effort getting around those 
protests. 
</P>
<P>
 "As a tactical matter, a negotiating matter, it was a waste of time," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In making the announcement Thursday, U.S. Trade Representative Mickey Kantor 
carefully avoided mention of any specific nations or trading practices to be 
targeted, saying a final list will be issued Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 Some observers said they believe that the delay is meant to give the United 
States and Japan time to work out their differences before Super 301 is 
actually set into motion. 
</P>
<P>
 But others said they believe that Japan's reaction may be so forceful that it 
will only harden its position in the meantime. 
</P>
<P>
 "All it adds is rhetoric and a deadline," Williams said. "It's seen as 
deliberately provocative in Japan and therefore will politicize and irritate a 
negotiating process that now requires a degree of calmness and pragmatism." 
</P>
<P>
 The action could also create problems for the United States under the General 
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, the worldwide trading regime that prohibits 
unilateral trade actions by member nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This piece of legislation is not well liked . . . by any other country in the 
world. . . . The danger of Super 301 is it leaves the United States open to 
charges of unilateralism," said Smith, who is now president of SJS Advanced 
Strategies, a trade consulting firm in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Paula Stern, a senior fellow at the Progressive Policy Institute in Washington 
and former chairwoman of the U.S. International Trade Commission, said it is 
hard to say whether the provision will help or hurt. 
</P>
<P>
 On the one hand, the provision "is part of a war of nerves . . . part of the 
effort to ratchet up the pressure on Japan for change," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 On the other hand, the confrontational provision could stall reformist moves 
within Japan to deregulate the economy and make it more open to imports. "I 
don't think (Super 301) will necessarily advance Japan's initiatives," she 
said.

COURT OVERRULES BAN ON SOME TUNA IMPORTS; ENVIRONMENT: EMBARGO ORIGINALLY 
APPLIED TO 20 NATIONS WITH FLEETS THAT KILLED DOLPHINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal appeals court Thursday overruled a ban on U.S. imports of tuna from 
four nations that bought tuna from countries with fleets that killed dolphins. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals did not address the question of whether 
the embargo was required under a U.S. dolphin protection law, but said an 
environmental group had filed the suit in the wrong court in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
 The embargo, ordered in 1992, originally applied to 20 nations, including such 
major exporters as Thailand, but now covers only Costa Rica, Spain, Italy and 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 None of those four previously sold significant amounts of tuna in the United 
States, said David Phillips, executive director of Earth Island Institute, 
which filed the suit. 
</P>
<P>
 The trade ban was sought under provisions of the Marine Mammal Protection Act 
that limit U.S. imports of tuna from nations whose tuna fleets kill dolphins. 
Dolphins swim above yellowfin tuna in the eastern tropical Pacific and large 
numbers of them have drowned when caught in tuna nets. 
</P>
<P>
 One part of the law prohibits importing tuna from any nation whose 
dolphin-killing exceeds a standard set by the U.S. government. The two nations 
now covered by that law are Mexico and Venezuela. Chief U.S. District Judge 
Thelton Henderson ordered an embargo against them in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 That embargo, a sensitive subject in U.S.-Mexico relations, was not discussed 
in Thursday's ruling, leaving its status uncertain. The Bush Administration's 
unsuccessful appeal of Henderson's 1990 order did not challenge the judge's 
authority to hear the case. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal basis of that embargo will be strengthened in June when amendments 
to the Endangered Species Act take effect, said Brian Gorman of the National 
Marine Fisheries Service. The amendments will prohibit the sale in the United 
States of "any tuna that has not been certified dolphin-safe."

PLAN TO COUNT IMMIGRANTS IN SCHOOLS FAILS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL ROSS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Capping a highly emotional debate in which the specter of Nazi Germany was 
raised by angry Democrats, the House voted overwhelmingly Thursday to defeat a 
proposal to require public schools to document the number of illegal immigrants 
in their classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 A narrow majority of Republicans joined with Democrats to kill the legislation 
sponsored by Rep. Dana Rohrabacher (R-Huntington Beach) by a decisive 329-78 
vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Offered as an amendment to a $12.4-billion education projects bill, 
Rohrabacher's proposal would have required schools receiving federal funds to 
provide the Department of Education with enrollment figures for both their 
undocumented immigrant students and for lawfully resident pupils whose parents 
are in the United States illegally. 
</P>
<P>
 Arguing that the nation can no longer afford "to spend billions of dollars 
providing free education to people who are here illegally," Rohrabacher said 
his amendment would have allowed state and federal authorities to calculate the 
costs that illegal immigration imposes on the educational system in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
 In California and elsewhere, "the flood of illegal aliens is breaking the bank 
. . . and we have to get control of it," Rohrabacher argued. "It is essential 
for Congress to know how much it is costing to educate illegal aliens." 
</P>
<P>
 But while most lawmakers acknowledged that illegal immigration is a serious 
problem, they also agreed with Majority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) that it 
made no sense "to turn every school official in this country into an 
immigration officer," burdening educators with bureaucratic responsibilities 
"that are no part of their jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't believe it's right to have little children in public schools 
enlisted to be spies against their parents," said Rep. William Ford (D-Mich.), 
chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the outcome was never in doubt, the vehemence with which Democrats 
rose to attack the proposal inflamed tempers as the debate quickly degenerated 
into a shouting match filled with emotional allusions to Nazi Germany and 
accusations of racism. 
</P>
<P>
 Pounding the podium with his fist, Rep. Neil Abercrombie (D-Hawaii), denounced 
the amendment as "a contemporary 'Schindler's List.' " It was "insane" even to 
suggest the amendment given "what we learned about Nazi Germany in the period 
before World War II," Ford added. 
</P>
<P>
 "This amendment," thundered Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.), "was conceived in 
darkness and born of intolerance and division." 
</P>
<P>
 Rohrabacher said afterward that he was upset by tone of the rhetoric used 
against him. "If I were ever to even suggest that someone had communist 
sympathies because he opposed something I was pushing, the reaction (in 
Congress) would be outrage. . . . Yet we have to sit there for hours listening 
to people calling us Nazis because they oppose doing anything about this 
issue," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say we can't take care of everybody is not being mean spirited," 
Rohrabacher added. "We just don't have the money to provide free education and 
other services to everybody in the world who comes here illegally."

</P>
<P>
 Defeat of the proposal was met with relief and elation among local educators 
and activists. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would have created a subclass of illiterate adults that America would 
have to pay for in the long run," said John Palacio, an official with the 
Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. "It is in America's 
interest that immigrant children who reside in this country be afforded the 
educational opportunities so they can become productive members of society. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think elected officials saw it for what it was -- political posturing and 
nothing other than that," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Art Montez, state director of urban affairs for League of United Latin 
American Citizens, said the proposal violated both the Constitution and moral 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm finally glad that in the hollow chambers of Congress, there's still the 
light of hope and intelligence," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County Board of Education Vice President Elizabeth Parker said at the 
very least, the proposal would have proved a devastating financial blow to 
schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "This would have been an additional financial burden without any money 
attached," she said. 
</P>
<P>

 Tellers believes the league will be tough this season, but with 10 returning 
starters, he also thinks his team can weather the storm. "Our returning players 
have lots of playing experience, but pitching will be the key," Tellers said. 
Although he thinks the Raiders will do well on offense and defense, he admits 
his team will need luck on its side if it is going to make a title run. Last 
year, the Raiders finished last (3-12), but still managed to place four players 
on first and second all-league teams. Although Sonora lost two key players in 
Todd Vorrell and Peter Lythgoe to graduation, Tellers has a feeling this team 
might surprise some people. "We didn't get much (luck) last year," he said, 
noting that eight games were lost by one run. "It's tough to lose by one . . . 
but eight games?" Nevertheless, Tellers will try to keep the team focused and 
hope for some good pitching.

 Meggison, a fourth-year coach, knows the feeling of having to start rolling 
that rock up the hill again. For him, it's called a rebuilding year. From being 
close to the top of the heap, to being at the bottom. "We lost some very 
important people last year," said Meggison, whose team finished second in 
league in 1993 with a record of 18-6, 10-5. "A big loss for us was Alfredo 
Garcia, who was MVP of the Freeway League, all-county, All-Southern Section, 
MVP of the Orange County All-Star game and led the county in earned-run 
average. "It's hard to replace someone of that caliber." Also graduating was 
all-league pitcher Alfonse Flores and shortstop Jason Cabral. In all, seven 
starters are gone. Nevertheless, Meggison is straight forward about the 
situtation. "When you have 10 freshmen and 11 sophomores, you have no illusions 
about things," he said. That's not to say this year will be a waste. Far from 
it, he said, noting that rebuilding is part of the grand scheme. He does expect 
some good things from Greg Cabral, Jason's younger brother. Meggison expects 
Cabral to be one of his key players at shortstop. The league will be tough with 
Troy, Fullerton and La Habra. "We've got some young kids this year. And I'm 
sure we'll make lots of mistakes. But in time these kids will learn and get 
better. We'll be back."

 German thinks his team might have a good chance to show something this year. 
And you can't blame the first-year coach for his positive outlook. He has a 
veteran team returning, including senior and first-team all-league selection 
Huff at catcher and second-team all-league pick Shadle at third base. German 
has some legitimate reasons for believing his team can improve upon its 
fourth-place finish from last year. "We have some good experience returning, 
which is always a plus," he said. However, before the band begins to play, 
German realizes one key element must be present. "Pitching will be the big 
question mark," he said. Right now, junior Payne, who started last year, and 
senior Perez could battle it out for a place in the rotation. "Fundamentals 
should keep us in every game. But we will need some pitching if we want to go 
further."

 Ilertsen calls the Freeway League "well balanced," and said any team could 
make the playoffs. But don't be fooled by the humble fifth-year coach. Among 
the opposition, all agreed that Troy will once again be the team to beat. For 
starters, the Warriors have a strong contingent of returning starters, 
including Logan at catcher, Richey at third base, Ruzzi in center field, 
Downing in right field and all-league pitcher Parmenter. Troy easily took the 
league title last year and placed three players on the all-league first team 
and three more on the second. And though Troy stumbled in first round of the 
Southern Section Division II playoffs, losing to Redondo Beach Redondo Union, 
9-7, in extra innings, the fact that Redondo eventually lost to champion Lompoc 
made the defeat a little easier to take. But this year, Ilertsen said his team 
might go all the way. Along with the core of returners, he is expecting some 
help from several newcomers, including outfielder Elliott, pitcher/shortstop 
Gray and second baseman Brown.

 Before any predictions, Elliott wants to make it clear Troy will be great, 
Sonora and Fullerton should battle for first and La Habra will be improved. 
Now, moving on to his team. Like Buena Park, the Lancers will feature several 
new faces this season. And like the Coyotes, Sunny Hills has lost some key 
players to graduation. Six starters are gone, which for any team is a big loss. 
But every team has to go through a rebuilding stage, and this time it's Sunny 
Hills' turn. But Elliott isn't pulling out his hair. The Lancers have some good 
returning players in juniors Hochgesang at shortstop, Monson at second base and 
senior Wescott, who is moving from outfield to play third base. On paper, the 
Lancers shouldn't be as far removed from the race as Elliott makes it sound, 
and with senior pitcher Herrera back, this could also be a important factor in 
giving the Lancers strength at a position which for now is an unknown.

 Though the Indians finished fifth in league last season, Hes believes his team 
will be more competitive this year. "We have quite a few starters coming back 
and the chemistry seems to be there," Hes said. First-team all-league selection 
Ginter will return, along with Golisamo, whom Hes called the team's ace. "I 
think we have the talent to be competitive," he said, adding that the team also 
has good depth, which could be a factor later in the season. Hes points to the 
younger members of the team, in particular Brickell, who plays third and 
catches, and Almonza, an outfielder and pitcher, as ones to watch. "Of course, 
Troy will be the team to beat. But we hope that we'll at least be in the 
running."

CHEVALIER LEAVES HIS MARK IN FINAL GAME; COLLEGE BASKETBALL: SENIOR GUARD 
SCORES 38 TO SET SCHOOL RECORD IN NORTHRIDGE'S 95-87 VICTORY OVER SAN DIEGO 
STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 They didn't pinch Andre Chevalier. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, they dumped a cold bucket of water on him. 
</P>
<P>
 Nope, it wasn't a dream. He actually did get wet. 
</P>
<P>
 On a night when everything went right for him, a postgame ice bath did little 
to cool off Cal State Northridge's senior point guard. 
</P>
<P>
 He was hot and happy. 
</P>
<P>
 Needing a career-high point total to become Northridge's all-time scoring 
leader, Chevalier got it -- and then some -- to lead the Matadors to a stirring 
95-87 victory over San Diego State Thursday night in a nonconference basketball 
game before 1,339 at Peterson Gym. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier, who needed 29 points to break Jim Malkin's 32-year old record of 
1,301, poured in 38 -- including 26 in the second half when Northridge shot a 
blistering 63.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 "My last game couldn't have been better," said Chevalier, a 6-foot senior. 
"Everything was perfect. The coaching -- everything." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed it was. Perhaps especially the coaching. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier had only 12 points with 18 minutes to go, then exploded for 14 
points in a span of a little over five minutes as Northridge coaches relayed 
plays calling his number. 
</P>
<P>
 What appeared a concerted effort in fact was exactly that. "They wanted to get 
the record out of the way so I could concentrate on the game," Chevalier said. 
</P>
<P>
 And take a rest. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier broke the record on a free throw that completed a three-point play 
with 7:08 left. He immediately looked toward the Northridge bench, furiously 
patting his head with his right hand. 
</P>
<P>
 No, he wasn't signaling that he had risen to the top of the scoring charts. 
</P>
<P>
 He was asking out. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge Coach Pete Cassidy, who promised Chevalier as many minutes as the 
player could muster in his final college game, quickly obliged. 
</P>
<P>
 Cassidy said he didn't know how many points Chevalier had at that juncture, 
but the rest of the bench certainly did. There were high-fives all around. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier said teammates on the bench were keeping him abreast of his 
progress, but even then he temporarily lost track during his flurry of 
second-half points. 
</P>
<P>
 "The points were coming so fast," Chevalier said. 
</P>
<P>
 Career point 1,302 put Northridge up, 73-68, but San Diego State went on a run 
to tie the score, 77-77, on a layup by Terrence Hamilton with 3:57 to play. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the Aztecs made only three more field goals -- the final two with 
less than 30 seconds to go and Northridge holding a nine-point lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier, whose point total set a Northridge Division I single-game record, 
tacked on nine more in the final 3 1/2 minutes to help the Matadors pull away 
in their final game of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego State (10-15) got 25 points and nine rebounds from Carlus Groves, 16 
from Derric Croft and 14 from Hamilton. 
</P>
<P>
 For Northridge, Brooklyn McLinn backed Chevalier with 16 points. Peter Micelli 
added 14 and Ryan Martin had 10. 
</P>
<P>
 Chevalier made 13 of 23 shots and 12 of 15 free throws. His previous high for 
shots was 16 against Southern Utah in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if he had to shoot 30 times he was going to get (the record)," McLinn 
said. "It was just as important to me and the team as it was for Andre to get 
that record." 
</P>
<P>
 McLinn, who also completed his career, just missed getting a record for 
himself. He had four steals to give him 61 for the season, just one shy of the 
Northridge record set by Derrick Gathers in 1989-90. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the former nonscholarship walk-on said the final memory of his senior 
season will be a pleasant one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like you want to cry in times like these of happiness," McLinn said. 
"But we've had so much sorrow this season I don't think I could get up a tear 
right now." 
</P>
<P>
 McLinn was referring not to Northridge's 18 losses -- but losses off the court 
from the Jan. 17 earthquake, the death of Micelli's father, Nicholas, and 
season-ending maladies suffered by seniors Chris Yard and Brent Lofton. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm very happy, just ecstatic for the players," Cassidy said. "They've been 
through a lot. . . . We have to be pleased, and I am."

ELBOW SURGERY PUTS KEMPTON OUT FOR SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Northridge senior right-hander Keven Kempton, an iron man who 
completed 13 of his 15 starts last year, will undergo reconstructive surgery on 
his right elbow Monday and will miss the remainder of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior, Kempton was 10-4 with an earned-run average of 3.99. He was 
expected to be the Matadors' top pitcher this season, but has struggled in each 
of his four appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton will have surgery performed Monday by Dr. Ronald Glousman of the 
Kerlan-Jobe Orthopaedic Clinic in Inglewood. He learned of the elbow damage 
Wednesday and a follow-up exam Thursday confirmed that he has torn a tendon. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he told me, tears rolled down my cheeks," Kempton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton was 0-3 with an ERA of 7.71 and surrendered 38 hits in 25 2/3 innings. 
Opponents were batting .330 against him. In his last outing, Northridge was 
battered by Florida, 14-2, in a performance that he called "embarrassing." 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton, a transfer from East L.A. College, said rehabilitation is expected to 
take nine months, but his career isn't necessarily over. He might be granted a 
medical redshirt season by the NCAA. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton, who never used his redshirt year, was told by a Northridge athletic 
administrator that he likely will be eligible next year since he has not played 
in more than 20% of the Matadors' games this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior right-handers Rick Orr (0-1, 3.00 ERA) and Aaron D'Aoust (2-0, 2.13) 
are the favorites to take Kempton's place in the three-man starting rotation, 
joining senior Marco Contreras (1-3, 4.50) and junior John Najar (2-2, 5.59). 
</P>
<P>
 For the Matadors, this is familiar territory. Last season, No. 1 starter 
Steven Morales missed the season because of elbow problems, forcing Kempton and 
his mates to pick up the slack. 
</P>
<P>
 Kempton said he is committed to making a complete comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 "When God gives you lemons, you make lemonade, right?" he said. "If I could 
have had the surgery done (Thursday), I would have done it. I'm going to grow 
up because of this. I'm as determined as a guy can be." 
</P>
<P>
 The loss of Kempton -- who beat four of six nationally ranked opponents he 
faced last season -- marks the team's second blow. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, the Matadors lost first baseman Andy Shaw to knee surgery. Shaw was 
expected to provide power in the middle of the lineup.

TOSSING OUT THE OLD IN FAVOR OF NEW; GIRLS' BASKETBALL: CHANNEL ISLANDS' 
HOTCHKISS CHANGED FOR BETTER AFTER PLAQUE-THROWING INCIDENT, ON-CAMPUS FIGHT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNEDY COSGROVE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Channel Islands High guard Shawanda Hotchkiss will be at Buena's Division I-A 
championship game -- but not as a player. As a reluctant spectator. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotchkiss had burned to play in this game against the Bulldogs -- a 
second-round loss to Cerritos dashed her hopes -- and her motivation went 
beyond winning a championship or upsetting Buena, a nearby rival and 
perennially one of the state's top teams. 
</P>
<P>
 "It'll be hard watching them play knowing we should have been there," she 
said. "It's a total heartbreaker. That would have been the best thing in my 
career." 
</P>
<P>
 A Channel Islands-Buena game would have been a public confirmation of her 
turnaround, a chance to show how much she has matured since the last meeting 
between the teams. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotchkiss received plenty of notoriety that day in December, 1992, when her 
outburst turned a traditional postgame glad-handing into an "incident." 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands had just lost to the Bulldogs in the championship game of 
Buena's annual Kiwanis Club holiday tournament. Hotchkiss, then a junior and 
livid at the defeat, approached a Kiwanis member to receive a runner-up plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 Rules of decorum normally apply. Shake the hand, smile -- even through tears, 
if need be -- and return quietly to your seat. 
</P>
<P>
 The smiling man handed her the plaque. 
</P>
<P>
 Hotchkiss flung it against the gym wall. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone went, 'Oooooh ,' " she says. "I didn't care. I just walked off." 
</P>
<P>
 Channel Islands' fate was sealed with a Hotchkiss. Buena Coach Joe Vaughan 
dropped the Raiders from the tournament this season and refused to play them in 
summer league. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Channel Islands Coach Don Salado: "I don't blame him." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaquegate received attention in local newspapers for three days. Hotchkiss 
says she was criticized for several days at school and is still reminded of it. 
</P>
<P>
 So does she regret it? 
</P>
<P>
 "Honestly? No." 
</P>
<P>
 No? 
</P>
<P>
 "People say I should regret it, but I was young and when you're young you do 
things like that," she says. "It will never happen again. I learn from my 
mistakes." 
</P>
<P>
 After several years that featured lackadaisical effort in school, delinquent 
behavior and emotional outbursts that she was unable or unwilling to control, 
Hotchkiss pronounces herself a changed 17-year-old. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've finally figured out what high school basketball is all about," she says. 
"It's not about just being out there and playing. It's about going to school, 
getting grades and -- if you want -- going to college and doing bigger and 
brighter things." 
</P>
<P>
 As everyone who knows her is proud to point out, such talk is not mere spin 
doctoring. It has substance. 
</P>
<P>
 On the court, the 5-foot-7 shooting guard was more disciplined this season, 
more diligent and easier to coach. She averaged a team-best 16 points a game, 
was named the league's co-player of the year and led the Raiders (23-4) to the 
Marmonte League championship and a top 10 state ranking. 
</P>
<P>
 She is skilled enough to play at the NCAA Division I level and has attracted 
interest from USC, among others. But she has not yet scored the requisite 700 
on the Scholastic Aptitude Test in order to be immediately eligible for NCAA 
athletics. If she doesn't, she will attend an area junior college. 
</P>
<P>
 More striking is Hotchkiss' quantum leap in her non-basketball life, in which 
she was formerly a classic underachiever -- except when it came to getting in 
trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 The senior with the frank, lively face and dangling braids freely talks about 
ways she used to spend time: "Fighting, mouthing off, roaming the campus when I 
wasn't supposed to be." 
</P>
<P>
 Her sophomore and junior years were her worst, riddled with academic 
difficulties and discipline problems, including the infamous plaque toss and 
culminating with an on-campus fight for which she was suspended from school and 
forced to pay restitution for the other girl's visit to the doctor. 
</P>
<P>
 "That really shocked me," said her mother, Faye Jackson. "And I think it made 
her look in the mirror." 
</P>
<P>
 She did and saw her life in a jumble, as fragmented as broken glass. So she 
began putting the pieces back together. 
</P>
<P>
 She joined the track team and excelled in the triple jump. Salado, who coached 
the boys' team, watched her respond to the positive attention she received from 
the coaches. 
</P>
<P>
 Salado took over the girls' team last summer. He was the only one, she says, 
who didn't deride her for throwing the plaque. But he did ask her to write a 
letter of apology to Vaughan. She did. 
</P>
<P>
 Says Salado: "I can honestly say I haven't had one problem with Shawanda. Her 
complete change has made me respect her a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Hotchkiss also took school more seriously and improved her grade point average 
a full point. Assistant principal Wayne Lamas says she hasn't received 
detention or been in trouble this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really turned it around," Lamas says. "You wish every kid sees the 
light like she did." 
</P>
<P>
 Hotchkiss helps young players during park league practices and games. She also 
has turned counselor, telling anyone who will listen not to go astray. 
</P>
<P>
 "If I had a chance to go back in time, I would erase all that stuff," she says 
with a somber but intense look in her brown eyes. "I regret everything I did, 
and it's not cool." 
</P>
<P>
 She realizes that keeping her cool is cool. 
</P>
<P>
 She was named to the All-Gold Coast tournament team in December, and the 
announcer called her to midcourt to hand her the award. The crowd applauded as 
she accepted the trophy. She turned toward Salado with a mischievous look and 
reared back as if to hurl the trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "No!" yelled Salado, who now laughs at the memory. 
</P>
<P>
 The new Hotchkiss burst out laughing. Only kidding.

BONEBRIGHT HOPING TO END HIS CAREER ON POSITIVE NOTE; WRESTLING: THOUSAND OAKS 
SENIOR, WHO STRESSES THE MENTAL APPROACH, IS THINKING ABOUT A STATE 
CHAMPIONSHIP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tim Bonebright is a gripping example of the power of positive thinking. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks High senior stretches mentally and physically before a big 
wrestling match. As he goes through his warm-up routine, he repeats to himself 
two simple messages: 
</P>
<P>
 You can beat this guy. Give it your all, and you will win.  
</P>
<P>
 Those thoughts turned to truth in the Marmonte League finals and the Southern 
Section Division I championships, as Bonebright took titles at 145 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Last weekend at the Masters tournament, Bonebright said he wasn't mentally 
ready for the final, and lost, 15-7, for only the third time all season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just wasn't into it and I wrestled terribly," he said. "Maybe it was 
because I had already qualified for state." 
</P>
<P>
 By making the final Bonebright achieved a season-long goal, qualifying for the 
state championships which begin today in Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Positive thinking is part of a persona change whenever Bonebright steps onto 
the mat. Normally quiet, he becomes intense and aggressive. 
</P>
<P>
 In the league finals three weeks ago, Bonebright avenged two earlier losses to 
Simi Valley's Jesse Holt and celebrated with a victory lap around the mat. Then 
he jumped into Coach Larry Mortensen's arms. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonebright repeated the post-match celebration after an 11-5 victory over 
Kevin Young of Hueneme in the Division I final. 
</P>
<P>
 He will have plenty of incentive for the state tournament. One loss and he's 
eliminated from the field of 32. 
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen believes Bonebright will recapture the intensity he needs to wrestle 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a down-to-earth kid and I think he was disappointed in himself last 
week," Mortensen said. "His goals were to place in CIF, Masters and State and I 
don't think he's satisfied with two of three." 
</P>
<P>
 The coach is somewhat surprised that his star pupil made it as far as the 
state tournament in the first place.  
</P>
<P>
 Mortensen wanted Bonebright to wrestle over the summer, but Bonebright chose 
to work out in the weight room instead.  
</P>
<P>
 But once the season started, Bonebright had the advantage of two teammates, 
Parry Wu and Fred Birckhead, who were comparable in weight and ability to 
Bonebright.  
</P>
<P>
 The threesome pushed each other and became the Lancers' best wrestlers. Wu was 
a Masters qualifier at 135 pounds and Birckhead was a league runner-up. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim works really hard in practice," Wu said. "He's intense and can get really 
mad when he's frustrated." 
</P>
<P>
 Bonebright is one of 13 area wrestlers advancing to the state championships. 
Alemany's James Casteneda (119 pounds), who finished fifth at 103 pounds last 
year, placed second in this year's Masters, suffering his first loss of the 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 Agoura's Chad Payne (125 pounds) finished third in the Masters. Other Southern 
Section wrestlers qualifying are Rio Mesa's Tom Nelford (152 pounds) and

BUENA MAKES FIFTH STRAIGHT APPEARANCE IN TITLE GAME; GIRLS' BASKETBALL: AFTER 
LOSING THE FIRST THREE, BULLDOGS FOCUS ON REPEATING AS CHAMPIONS.

 The Buena High girls' basketball team's march to a Southern Section final is 
almost commonplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs play Mater Dei tonight at 7:30 p.m. at Ventura College in the 
Division I-A championship game, Buena's fifth consecutive section appearance in 
a title game. 
</P>
<P>
 Winning the championship, though -- that's been another matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bulldogs lost three consecutive championship games, from 1990 through 
1992, before breaking through last season with a dramatic 44-43 victory over 
Thousand Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Senior forward Laura Dahl, who along with teammate Michelle Giordano were the 
first freshmen to play on the Buena varsity, wants to continue that tradition. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even though this is our fourth time (in a final), we've only won it once, and 
I want this season to be the best," Dahl said. "I think this year our chances 
are better than they have been the past few years to win (the section) and 
state championship." 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano is Buena's leading scorer, but her teammates are a talented group 
that by their own account play as more of a team than last year's squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Dahl averages 9.3 points a game, and Buena employs a three-guard lineup. 
</P>
<P>
 Junior Kara Newman averages 5.8 points and 3.5 assists, but the key for Buena 
could be the sophomore tandem of Eboni Conley and Kori Sebek, both of whom 
followed in the Giordano-Dahl tradition and played on the varsity as freshmen. 
</P>
<P>
 Conley, a 5-foot-8 point guard, is Buena's most versatile player. She averages 
10.5 points, 5.8 rebounds and 5.6 assists a game. Sebek adds 10.5 points and 
3.8 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 They will have to contend with Mater Dei's 6-foot center Leticia Oseguera 
(18.4 points, 8.4 rebounds) and guard Melody Peterson (15.1 points).

GIORDANO AGAIN WILL PUSH BUENA THROUGH FINAL HOOP; GIRLS' BASKETBALL: SENIOR 
WHO MADE WINNING FREE THROWS A YEAR AGO LEADS BULLDOGS INTO DIVISION I-A TITLE 
GAME. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Michelle Giordano was living a basketball shoe commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 "Fouled at the buzzer! No time left, down by one point, shooting two free 
throws to win the championship!"  
</P>
<P>
 It was the stuff of dreams, if not advertising copy writers. Buena High's 
Giordano -- as every youngster who ever shot a basket has done -- had imagined 
such a wildly tense moment, the kind of situation that makes you a hero. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, everyone wants that. (And those free throws are so easy to make in 
a fantasy.) 
</P>
<P>
 But it's another world actually being there, alone on the court, teammates and 
opponents waiting on the bench because there will be no rebound to grab. 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand of eyes dissecting you. Sound cascading in your ears, adrenaline 
coursing through your body. So easy, almost tempting, to give into nerves. 
Failure is so irrevocable. So public. 
</P>
<P>
 Who wants that? 
</P>
<P>
 In last year's Southern Section Division I-A championship against nemesis 
Thousand Oaks, Giordano was fouled at the buzzer, her team trailing by one 
point. 
</P>
<P>
 Buena had lost to Thousand Oaks in the championship game the past two years. 
Miss the free throws, and Giordano becomes Excuse No. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 She calmly sank both shots, and was buried under jubilant teammates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rate it as one of the great moments in our program," said Buena Coach Joe 
Vaughan, whose Bulldog teams have won over 450 games, three section titles and 
two state championships in his 19 years. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are people that still mention it as the most exciting game they ever 
had a chance to watch." 
</P>
<P>
 Tonight, Giordano will lead Buena into its fourth consecutive section 
championship game. The Bulldogs (23-2) take on Mater Dei (24-3) tonight at 7 
p.m. at Ventura College in the Division I-A final. 
</P>
<P>
 The spotlight will shine on Giordano, the 6-foot senior who averages 17.9 
points and 7.8 rebounds a game and has signed with Arizona. And that's just 
fine with her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I love big games like this," she said. "I like to play under pressure; it's 
just if everybody else can handle it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a rare person who can shrug off tension like she did. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had all the pressure on her shoulders, and she just relaxed and shot them 
like she did in practice," Buena forward Laura Dahl said. "It's such an odd 
situation to have to perform at a normal level." 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano said people still approach her to talk free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody always asks me, 'Were you scared? Were you nervous?,' " Giordano 
said. "I say, 'I don't know, I didn't even really think about it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 The play stands as a defining moment in her stellar career, but it is not the 
only time she faced a difficult situation with aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, Giordano and Dahl were the first freshmen to earn spots on 
the Buena varsity. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Giordano said she was talented enough to start, she came off the bench. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Vaughan didn't want to put the pressure on of having a freshman start," 
she said. "It was new for him too." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Vaughan: "I thought she was mature beyond her years, not only physically 
but mentally and emotionally." 
</P>
<P>
 The experiment was a smashing success. Giordano played an integral part of 
Buena's advance to the I-A title game. 
</P>
<P>
 As a sophomore and junior, she used her deadly medium-range jump shot and 
physical play to come into her own. She averaged 15.4 points as a sophomore and 
17.5 as a junior. She was the Channel League's most valuable player and a 
Times' All-Ventura County selection each year, and a Division I All-State 
selection last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's definitely one of the top five players we've ever had in our program," 
Vaughan said. "I'm not into rating players, but I'm comfortable saying that." 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano is the second all-time leading scorer in school history, behind 
Teresa Palmisano. 
</P>
<P>
 But her chance to break Palmisano's record was derailed when she sustained a 
knee injury Jan. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 "A Rio Mesa player landed on my leg after she shot and popped my knee out," 
she said. "It was my first major injury. I was worried I had torn my anterior 
cruciate ligament. I knew if you did that you were out forever." 
</P>
<P>
 Fortunately, she only sprained the medial collateral ligament in her right 
knee, and missed five games. She plays wearing a bulky brace that limits her 
mobility but has not affected her shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 The team lost one game during her absence, but was well-served by Vaughan's 
emphasis on balance and team play. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of teams, if they had someone like her, that's all they would go to," 
he said. "But I think that limits you in the long run." 
</P>
<P>
 Buena has played well since Giordano's return, breezing through the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it is expected of us to get to the CIF finals," Giordano said. "If we 
lost, there would have been a big to-do." 
</P>
<P>
 Giordano likes Buena's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year the team is exceptionally close," she said. "We're better friends 
so we play like more of a team. And that just makes it so much easier." 
</P>
<P>
 Easier to play well, to win and to deal with the pressure -- though Giordano 
doesn't need much help with that.

APPLICANTS FOR BURROUGHS COACHING POSITION WARY OF A REPEAT; HIGH SCHOOL 
FOOTBALL: SHODDY PROCESS USED TO PICK BURBANK COACH WORRIES FONG, DOS REMEDIOS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Richard Fong said he nearly canceled his interview. Robert Dos Remedios said 
he was finished dealing with the Burbank Unified School district before he was 
prodded by a booster. 
</P>
<P>
 But despite being also-rans in the bizarre and controversial hiring of John 
Hazelton as football coach at Burbank High last month, both have become 
candidates for the Burroughs football coaching position vacated by Gary 
Bernardi. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong and Dos Remedios, hoping for better luck a second time around, will give 
the Burbank school district a second chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them I won't even think about this unless it's an open thing," said 
Dos Remedios, 27, an assistant coach at Glendale College. "I just want it to be 
open." 
</P>
<P>
 Dos Remedios and Fong, The Times' Valley Coach of the Year at St. Genevieve in 
1993, were finalists for the Burbank job. Days before they were scheduled to be 
interviewed by a selection committee, a Burbank school trustee said Hazelton 
would be hired. 
</P>
<P>
 "The day before I interviewed I called and asked if it was a done deal," Fong 
said. "After I talked to them, I was still thinking about not going. But I 
wanted to do the interview." 
</P>
<P>
 Fong said his interview was delayed for one hour, and while he waited he heard 
loud arguing on the other side of the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Hazelton eventually was hired. But in the aftermath, Fong and Dos Remedios 
were troubled by two notions: 1) that Hazelton's selection was a foregone 
conclusion, and, 2) that dissension ran rampant within school district. 
</P>
<P>
 Fong and Dos Remedios said certain Burbank High administrators picked them but 
were overruled by a majority vote of the selection committee. The voting 
procedure -- being used for the first time since a new trustee changed the 
rules -- took the hiring authority away from the school principal and gave it 
to the school board. 
</P>
<P>
 The principal was reduced to committee member. The committee consisted of 
parents, administrators and high school athletes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Feb. 16, the night the school board chose Hazelton, Burbank Principal Keiko 
Hentell was demoted to English teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm almost positive she voted for me, and that was part of the reason she got 
fired," Dos Remedios said. "She decided to tell the committee, 'This is who the 
administration supports.' But she was getting swarmed." 
</P>
<P>
 Burroughs Principal Tim Buchanan said there will be no infighting when the 
12-member committee, of which he is a part, starts interviews Monday. He 
supports the new selection format. 
</P>
<P>
 "We won't vote," he said. "We will get a consensus. We will have a ranking 
system (that measures qualifications of candidates)." 
</P>
<P>
 But it remains to be seen if this less personalized approach will reduce a 
pre-interview favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 "Somebody saying it was a done deal before I interviewed made the district and 
the school look silly," Dos Remedios said. 
</P>
<P>
 A done deal? The same anonymous school district official who paraded Hazelton 
said Burroughs' boosters are seeking former San Fernando Coach Tom Hernandez. 
Hernandez, who has been employed for 15 years with the Los Angeles Unified 
School District, said Wednesday he was negotiating for tenure with Burbank 
district officials. "It has to be the right situation where I don't lose a lot 
of money," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 The application deadline is today. Buchanan said Thursday that Hernandez has 
applied. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Dunivant is the one district trustee who would figure to have a keen 
interest. He taught at Burroughs for 32 1/2 years and was football coach for 
25. Yet Dunivant, who is not a member of the committee, said he'll mind his own 
business and advises other board members to do the same. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't have a recommendation, and I don't think any board member should be 
sticking his nose in (the committee's) business," Dunivant said. "All we're 
going to do is rubber stamp who the committee selects. 
</P>
<P>
 "And check references."

COACH RATES LATE-BLOOMING CANTRELL AMONG HIS BEST; HIGH SCHOOL BASKETBALL: 
REMARKABLE IMPROVEMENT OF SENIOR FORWARD SURPRISES EVEN VETERAN LOU 
CVIJANOVICH, IN HIS 36TH SEASON WITH SANTA CLARA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Lou Cvijanovich, the boys' basketball coach at Santa Clara High, has seen his 
teams win 720 games.  
</P>
<P>
 He's twice seen them win more than 80 Frontier League games in a row. 
Cvijanovich is in his 36th season coaching the Saints. He was coaching when 
"Louie Louie" was a hit record on Billboard's charts. 
</P>
<P>
 He's been around long enough to see everything, but not long enough to get a 
surprise. The emergence of senior Damian Cantrell this season caught 
Cvijanovich off guard. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell, a 6-foot-4 guard/forward, has risen from sixth-man status into the 
irrepressible standout who has helped put Santa Clara (19-7) into today's 6 
p.m. Southern Section Division IV-A championship game against Verbum Dei at UC 
Irvine's Bren Center. 
</P>
<P>
 "To be honest, I didn't know how good Damian would be," Cvijanovich said.  
</P>
<P>
 "You don't expect any of them to improve that much. Some of them do. Some of 
them play basketball until they're dead and they never get better." 
</P>
<P>
 But here is Cantrell, being named Frontier League tri-player of the year along 
with Nordhoff's Mark Sebek and Santa Paula's Manuel Escamilla.  
</P>
<P>
 Here is Cantrell, averaging 21.6 points and 8.4 rebounds. 
</P>
<P>
 There was Cantrell, taking away the spotlight from Duke-bound Ricky Price by 
scoring 21 points and grabbing 13 rebounds in a 47-33 victory over Serra on 
Tuesday night in the semifinals.  
</P>
<P>
 And talking about respect and recognition for Santa Clara afterward. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody's talking (Serra's) Ricky Price -- he's going to Duke," Cantrell 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's what drives me. It was all Ricky Price the whole week." 
</P>
<P>
 Here's Cvijanovich, suddenly comparing Cantrell with Shon Tarver and son Stacy 
Cvijanovich -- the best of 3 1/2 decades. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a real fierce competitor," Cvijanovich said. "He's been tremendous all 
year." 
</P>
<P>
 And in 12 months he went from role player to pacesetter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He grew three inches over the summer and he played 30 summer league games," 
Cvijanovich said of Cantrell.  
</P>
<P>
 "And he went to clinics. I thought he was a pretty good player at 6-1, but he 
needed that three extra goddang inches." 
</P>
<P>
 He can dunk, and his accuracy from three-point range is 43%.  
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell has exploded onto the scene with point totals of 30, 29, 30, 27, 27, 
32, 31 and 26 while playing for a team that likes to keep the pace slow and 
point totals low. 
</P>
<P>
 Cantrell is the latest Saint to be groomed for Division I by Cvijanovich.  
</P>
<P>
 But Cvijanovich won't say which teams are recruiting him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He says I've been getting lots of letters, but he won't tell me from who 
until after the season," Cantrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 That might not be for another week or two.  
</P>
<P>
 Regardless of how Santa Clara fares against top-seeded Verbum Dei (23-2), the 
Saints have an automatic berth in the state tournament.

TWO O.C. DEFENSE FIRMS CRITICIZED FOR EXPENSES; AUDIT: GAO SAYS SPARTA, SRS 
TECHNOLOGIES BILLED U.S. FOR ALCOHOL, TRIPS TO MEXICO, CARIBBEAN AND HAWAII. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Orange County defense companies were criticized Thursday for billing the 
Pentagon hundreds of thousands of dollars in illegal or questionable expenses, 
including trips to exotic resorts for executives, excessive company car 
expenses, alcohol and unexplained consultant costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparta Inc. in Laguna Hills and SRS Technologies in Newport Beach were part of 
a group of eight defense contractors whose government billing practices were 
audited by the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the report does not publicly break down specific questionable 
expenses company by company, a congressional source identified those incurred 
by the Orange County firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the questionable but legal expenses, the GAO found that Sparta sought 
government reimbursement for a $46,000 trip to Grand Cayman Island; $102,000 
for a trip to Jamaica; $49,000 for a trip to Puerto Vallarta; and $135,000 for 
a trip to Hawaii. The trips were reportedly for annual management and business 
meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 On the trip to Jamaica for which the company sought $102,000 in 
reimbursements, according to the GAO, the company sent 151 employees to Montego 
Bay to attend its annual stockholders meeting. The employees brought 112 
spouses or guests, the report said. The report doesn't say how much of the trip 
or which expenses were billed to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip was "intended to promote a corporate cohesiveness via both social and 
business interaction," the GAO report said. The company reportedly contended 
that the costs of meetings in resort areas are a form of incentive 
compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report said: "While we do not argue with the need to have legitimate 
business meetings, when the business trip takes on the character of a vacation, 
such as in the above instances, we question whether the government should pay 
for contractor employees to attend business meetings at resort locations." 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report did not specify whether the Pentagon had requested the return 
of any of the questioned expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparta is also being questioned about billing the Pentagon for $2,300 in meals 
for spouses; $27,500 for personal use of a company car; $1,400 for alcoholic 
beverages; and $102,000 in inadequately documented consultant fees, according a 
congressional source familiar with the government audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Sparta and SRS Technologies declined to comment Thursday evening 
about the report or to provide explanations at a congressional hearing held 
Thursday in Washington to discuss the findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Even after Sparta was notified in 1992 of an investigation by congressional 
investigators, GAO analyst David E. Cooper told the committee Thursday, company 
officials billed the government for $229,000 for a trip to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 SRS Technologies is also being questioned about the legality of billing the 
government for $10,000 for the personal use of a company car; $1,400 for 
alcoholic beverages; $37,000 in consultant costs that were not adequately 
documented; and $14,700 to cover the company's legal costs in a lawsuit against 
the government. 
</P>
<P>
 SRS Technologies also allegedly billed $44,000 in costs for a trip that 40 
employees and one consultant to the company took to the Elbow Beach Hotel in 
Bermuda. The GAO said it considered this cost questionable but not forbidden in 
regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, this is not Donald Trump's Visa bill," said Sen. Jim Sasser, D-Tenn., 
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, in remarks prepared for the hearing. 
"It's the tab the American taxpayers are picking up for what defense 
contractors euphemistically call 'overhead.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Sparta is one of the most secretive defense contractors in Orange County. 
Sparta President Wayne Winton once told a reporter that any employee who talks 
to the press about the company is fined. On occasion, however, the company 
talks to the media regarding its role in various government contracts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparta is a key contractor in various contracts related to ballistic missile 
defense, known in the past as Star Wars, as well as other classified 
engineering projects. The company has grown to 640 employees and $79.6 million 
last year, according to Dun & Bradstreet. 
</P>
<P>
 SRS Technologies has 370 employees and sales last year estimated at $30 
million, according to Dun & Bradstreet, which gathers market research data. 
Most of the employees are spread out in offices around the country, with only 
28 in Newport Beach.  
</P>
<P>
 SRS Technologies specializes in testing and evaluating weapons systems. The 
company tested the Patriot missile defense system that was used during the 
Persian Gulf War against Iraqi Scud missile attacks. It has also participated 
in Star Wars ballistic missile defense research. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsa Boggs, assistant to President Mohindar S. Sandhu at SRS Technologies, 
said the president was traveling Thursday and had no immediate comment. Patty 
Smith, an assistant to Sparta's Winton, said he, too, was not available. 
</P>
<P>
 Two GAO audits turned up a total of $4.9 million in costs that were 
questionable or illegal. That amount was in addition to $4.4 million in charges 
that the Pentagon's own contract watchdog agency had rejected. 
</P>
<P>
 The first study of six small contractors, including SRS Technologies and 
Sparta, found $2 million in illegal or questionable expenses in addition to $1 
million rooted out by Pentagon contract auditors.  
</P>
<P>
 The other companies are Foster-Miller Inc. in Waltham, Mass.; Sippican Inc. in 
Marion, Mass.; Electromagnetic Sciences Inc. in Norcross, Ga.; and MA-COM Inc. 
in Wakefield, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 The second GAO study examined two large contractors. Here, auditors identified 
$2.9 million in illegal or questionable charges in addition to $3.4 million 
uncovered earlier by the Pentagon. The two larger companies were E-Systems Inc. 
of Dallas and McDonnell Douglas Corp. of St. Louis. Sparta Inc. at a Glance

QUAKE RENEWS DEBATE OVER VERTICAL THRUST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Of all the brutal surprises of the Northridge earthquake, its intense vertical 
motion has been one of the most discussed. The quake's strong upward heaving 
has become a popular explanation for the failure of parking garages and other 
structures that were fortified only against lateral force. 
</P>
<P>
 To underscore the unexpected power of the quake's upward motion, some owners 
and designers of trashed buildings have noted that the Uniform Building Code, 
adopted as law by California cities and counties, does not significantly 
address vertical thrust as a cause of structural failure. 
</P>
<P>
 But more than two decades ago, an official with the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration wrote that the Sylmar earthquake of 1971 "produced 
evidence of vertical accelerations far in excess of any ever recorded 
instrumentally." 
</P>
<P>
 And a committee of the Oakland-based Earthquake Engineering Research 
Institute, discussing the effects of the Sylmar quake, cited "strong evidences 
of severe vertical accelerations which could contribute to increased damage." 
</P>
<P>
 Similar descriptions of the Northridge quake may be a case of "short-term 
engineering memory," as one government seismologist put it. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the Northridge temblor, engineers involved in the code-revision 
process say the significance of vertical motion -- on the back burner since the 
Sylmar quake -- deserves another look. 
</P>
<P>
 But as if to illustrate that little about an earthquake is simple, some 
experts still doubt that vertical thrust played a primary role in structural 
failures. These authorities fear the vertical explanation is being oversold and 
may divert attention from what they consider to be a more pervasive problem -- 
strong cost-cutting pressures that can lead to inadequate designs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always nice to blame Mother Nature," but blame is "as much on the human 
side as the nature side," said Helmut Krawinkler, co-director of the John A. 
Blume Earthquake Engineering Center at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not in the group that's ready to jump on the vertical bandwagon," said 
Wilfred D. Iwan, director of Caltech's Earthquake Engineering Research 
Laboratory and chairman of the state Seismic Safety Commission. "But everywhere 
I go I hear people using this to explain the poor performance of certain 
structures." 
</P>
<P>
 As currently written, the building code reflects the prevailing view that the 
risk of structural collapse in a big quake stems from sideways shaking. 
</P>
<P>
 That consensus survived the Sylmar quake, at least partly because the 
significance -- and even the accuracy -- of its high vertical-thrust recordings 
were a matter of dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Centered beneath the San Gabriel Mountains, the Sylmar quake had a magnitude 
of 6.4. At the time, only a few strong-motion accelerographs were deployed in 
the immediate quake area. These instruments measure the lateral and vertical 
ground motion at specific points as a fraction of the force of gravity -- 
expressed as 1.0g. 
</P>
<P>
 One instrument at Pacoima Dam above Sylmar recorded extraordinarily sharp 
vertical peaks of .5g to .75g. But many experts were not impressed, and when 
the code was strengthened in 1974, the revisions did not reflect this finding. 
</P>
<P>
 "People tended to discard that record (at Pacoima Dam) as unrepresentative," 
said Filip Filippou of the Earthquake Engineering Research Center at UC 
Berkeley. It "always had some kind of aura of unbelievability to it because it 
was just one. . . . Maybe it explains a little bit why we haven't done 
anything, if you want to call it that." 
</P>
<P>
 Some questioned the accuracy of the reading, believing that the instrument's 
perch atop a steep ridge above the dam made it vulnerable to topographic 
effects. Debate continued for years on whether the readings were valid or 
"aberrations due to instrumental error . . . because the strong-motion 
recording instruments don't always work," said Bob Chittendon, chairman of the 
seismology committee of the Structural Engineers Assn. of California. 
</P>
<P>
 Chittendon's organization is largely responsible for the code updates 
published every three years, drafting changes for the International Conference 
of Building Officials, which administers the code. Chittendon and others 
described code revision as a ponderous, consensus-building process in which 
changes often take years to effect. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a tremendous inertia in the profession," said Vitelmo Bertero, a 
research engineer with the Earthquake Engineering Research Center in Berkeley. 
Engineers, like other people, tend "to forget very soon the bad things," so 
that "if something is not done after two or three years after an earthquake, 
they forget about it," Bertero said. "This is the real problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Bertero and others said vertical motion deserves a new look based on the 
record of the Northridge quake. Still, several experts noted that the temblor's 
vertical thrust was not as remarkable as the intensity of its ground motion 
generally. 
</P>
<P>
 "This earthquake stands out, both in its horizontals and verticals, as being 
high," said Paul Somerville, an engineering seismologist with Woodward-Clyde 
Consultants in Pasadena. "It looks like ground motion you'd expect from a 
larger (than magnitude 6.8) earthquake." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Somerville and others said that the vertical accelerations at most 
sites were about two-thirds of the horizontal thrust, as is typical. "I don't 
see anything unusual about the vertical ground motion," Somerville said. "In 
relation to the horizontal motions, the vertical motions weren't exceptional." 
</P>
<P>
 At one site in Tarzana, an accelerograph recorded an extraordinarily high peak 
horizontal force of 1.8g -- nearly twice the force of gravity -- and a vertical 
acceleration of 1.2g. Pacoima Dam again recorded the highest readings, 
including horizontal and vertical accelerations as strong as 2.01g and 1.6g 
respectively. At least three other sites in the quake area -- in Newhall, 
Sylmar and Arleta -- experienced vertical thrust of more than .5g, according to 
data from the state Division of Mines and Geology's strong-motion 
instrumentation program. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly silent on the question of vertical motion, the building code assumes 
that the ability of structures to hold their own weight, with a margin of 
safety, is sufficient to prevent collapse from upward earthquake thrust. In 
post-mortems on the collapsed parking structures at Cal State Northridge and 
the Northridge Fashion Center, engineers involved in designing those projects 
suggested that the blind spot in the code accounted for the failures. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts said long-span structures such as parking garages, bridges and 
roadways may be particularly vulnerable to vertical thrust. "Personally, I 
think we need to address the vertical accelerations," Chittendon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, including Ron Hamburger, a member of the seismology committee 
of the structural engineers association, believe the vertical explanation may 
be diverting attention from poor design. 
</P>
<P>
 "It may eventually be found that vertical ground motion was a factor in some 
collapses," Hamburger said. "But based on my own observations, the structures 
which performed poorly generally had significant problems in their lateral 
load-resisting systems and would probably have done poorly even if no vertical 
ground motion had occurred." 
</P>
<P>
 With respect to sideways motion, experts said the code requires structures to 
successfully resist earthquakes with lateral accelerations of .4g, but they 
said well-designed buildings should stand up to considerably greater loads. 
</P>
<P>
 "There should be almost no chance of collapse at .4g," Hamburger said. "The 
(code's) intent is that you will not collapse for any earthquake you will ever 
see." 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, accelerograph recordings during the Northridge earthquake show that 
peak horizontal motion was well above .4g at some locations. "This is probably 
the first event . . . that really tested the code at probably the upper limit," 
said Bill Holmes, a member of an Earthquake Engineering Research Institute 
reconnaissance team that inspected quake damage. 
</P>
<P>
 There was "very intense shaking right under a populated area, so many 
code-designed structures were tested, and with the exception of parking 
structures that collapsed, one could make the argument . . . that most of the 
structures were successful," Holmes said. 
</P>
<P>
 Holmes and others noted that earthquake stress on buildings is more complex 
than what is reflected in ground-motion readings. Both seismic waves and 
buildings have frequencies, and the building will not take the full wallop of 
energy unless the frequency of the strongest waves are roughly matched with the 
frequency of the building. Thus, large peak ground motion, if carried on 
high-frequency waves, may trigger little shaking in a building of much lower 
frequency. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Northridge quake came within months of a scheduled code update, 
most major revisions will have to wait until 1997. As has been the case in the 
past, the aim of code improvements will not be to prevent building damage -- 
which is forecast in major quakes -- but to avert life-threatening collapses. 
</P>
<P>
 But code improvements are only half the battle, some experts say, due to a 
tendency to design buildings to the raw edge of the code. 
</P>
<P>
 "The code is not the maximum. The code is the minimum," Chittendon said. "You 
need to do things in addition to the code." 
</P>
<P>
 But as Krawinkler put it: "If you provide more safety . . . it doesn't come 
for free. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you tell me money is no object, I could guarantee you that I can design a 
building so that it will not collapse in any conceivable earthquake," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But "money is always an object." 
</P>
<P>
 * RELATED STORIES: B1 Earth's Moves 
</P>
<P>
 Faults are fractures in the earth's crust along which vertical and horizontal 
movements have taken place. The Northridge quake occurred on a thrust fault, 
causing more vertical movement than it would have on a strike slip fault. 
Strike Slip Fault 
</P>
<P>
 Movement is along adjacent horizontal planes and the fault plane, the rocks 
affected by faulting, is nearly vertical. The two sides slide past each other 
horizontally during a quake, causing sideways movement. The San Andreas fault 
is the largest such fault in California. Thrust Fault 
</P>
<P>
 Movement is characterized by upward motion and the fault is inclined, usually 
dipping between 25 and 60 degrees. The block sitting on top of the plane moves 
up and past the block below the plane, causing both horizontal and vertical 
motion. Vertical motion during the Northridge quake was six to nine feet at the 
depth of the fault, about 11 miles below the surface, according to experts. 
</P>
<P>
 A fault at a 45-degree angle would produce about equal horizontal and vertical 
movement; one at more than 45 degrees would produce more vertical and less 
horizontal movement. 
</P>
<P>
 The previously unknown fault that caused the Northridge quake is believed to 
be about 35 degrees, producing a bit more horizontal than vertical movement.

VAN NUYS PUBLIC HEALTH CENTER IS CONDEMNED; AFTERMATH: QUAKE-DAMAGED SUPPORT 
BEAMS FOUND ON FOURTH INSPECTION FORCE CLOSURE OF THE KEY COUNTY FACILITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Employees and patients arrived at the San Fernando Valley's largest public 
health center Thursday to find that it had been condemned because of earthquake 
damage -- more than a month after three inspections deemed it safe enough to be 
used as a medical command post during the post-disaster relief effort. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was allowed inside the five-story Mid-Valley Comprehensive Health 
Center in Van Nuys, which was cordoned off with yellow tape. Card tables were 
set up in the parking lot under the 80-degree sun, from where surprised 
patients were referred to other Los Angeles County health clinics that offer 
free or low-cost medical services. 
</P>
<P>
 The sudden condemnation came late Wednesday after a fourth inspection revealed 
four cracked support beams on the top floor of the 34-year-old health center, 
county officials said. They said the building in the 7500 block of Van Nuys 
Boulevard will be closed for at least 18 months and possibly as long as two 
years, displacing 140 employees and forcing patients, who visited the center 
93,000 times last year, to seek medical care elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 "The building has to be able to hold up the weight of the roof and, at this 
point in time, it's not strong enough," said Jan Pollard, a county spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, the county is exploring ways to continue providing medical 
services in Van Nuys, including renting a nearby building or setting up tents 
and trailers in the parking lot of the damaged health center. 
</P>
<P>
 The belated condemnation angered some county employees, who believed that the 
building was a safe haven because the county had used it as the local 
headquarters of the post-quake medical relief effort. From the conference room 
on the top floor -- the same one where the cracked beams were found -- county 
officials deployed doctors and nurses to determine health needs at local parks 
and shelters. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very concerned that it was a danger to us for all that time," said one 
county employee, who asked not to be identified. "They should have found out 
sooner." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said they do not yet know whether the damage was overlooked 
during the first three inspections or whether it was sustained during the 
aftershocks that followed the Jan. 17 Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollard described the first three inspections as quick checks for obvious 
damage. 
</P>
<P>
 "They looked for things you could see easily, like cracks in the walls," she 
said. "We were trying to cover all our facilities immediately. The kinds of 
things they ultimately found aren't the kind of things that you see on a first 
inspection." 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the quake, the health center was closed for four days 
because it had no water and power, and that also gave crews time to clean up 
water damage from a burst main. 
</P>
<P>
 Before reopening Jan. 21, the building was inspected twice -- on Jan. 18 and 
20 -- by employees of the county's Internal Services Department, Pollard said. 
The department then paid $30,000 to have the independent structural engineering 
firm of Hill International double-check the building and dozens of other county 
facilities, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 All three inspections found no significant structural damage, she said. So 
employees of the health center, who had either been assigned to other county 
health clinics or providing some medical services in the building's parking 
lot, moved back inside. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, the fourth inspection was commissioned by the Department of 
Health Services as part of a complete review of all 44 of the county's 
remaining clinics and health centers. (A 45th facility, the San Fernando Health 
Clinic, had been immediately condemned as a result of quake damage and remains 
closed indefinitely.) 
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to be doubly sure things were OK," said Toby Staheli, a health 
department spokeswoman. The reports are also necessary to obtain reimbursement 
from the Federal Emergency Management Agency for earthquake damage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 28 of the clinics have been inspected, with damage found only at the 
Van Nuys health center, Pollard said. The remaining 16 buildings are in such 
areas as Long Beach and Hawaiian Gardens, which sustained little earthquake 
damage, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The fourth inspection of the Van Nuys health center was conducted by the 
structural engineering firm of Daniel, Mann, Johnson & Mendenhall, which 
charged the county $47,500 to check 17 county clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The inspection began Feb. 23. The next day, the engineers noticed a problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were walking on the roof and it was a little softer than would be 
expected," said Dick Erickson, an administrator with the company. "We don't 
know if it wasn't noticed the first few times or not. It could well have been 
the aftershocks." 
</P>
<P>
 The following day, engineers removed part of the ceiling on the fifth floor 
and found a cracked support beam, Pollard said. Tuesday, they discovered an 
additional cracked beam after tearing out drywall and ceiling tiles. That 
discovery caused evacuation of the fifth floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, two more cracked beams were discovered, and the building was 
condemned at 6:45 p.m. -- too late to inform most of the employees and all of 
the patients, Pollard said. 
</P>
<P>
 Some patients were fairly sanguine about being turned away Thursday from the 
large health center's 11 clinics, which provide such services as prenatal care, 
dentistry and pregnancy tests. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not their fault -- it's the earthquake's," said Raquel Gonzales, 35, who 
needed a tuberculosis test and immunizations for her two toddlers. 
</P>
<P>
 But others were annoyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Carla Saturno, 18, showed up to pick up the results of her test for HIV, the 
virus that causes AIDS. She was told that she would have to take the test again 
at another clinic because her records were stuck in an office in the building. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't believe I have to go through this whole thing again," said Saturno, 
who admitted being extremely anxious about the results. "I feel like I took the 
test for nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 The overnight closure was vexing for employees too, because medical records 
and equipment were stuck inside the condemned building, at least temporarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is terrible," said Vickie Harris, the nurse in charge of the 
immunization clinic. "The people here really need us. One little boy was in a 
lot of pain with his teeth. She (the mother) had an appointment to have (the 
tooth) filled, but I had to send her to Olive View (Medical Center in Sylmar). 
She'll have to wait all day there, and then they'll just pull the tooth." 
</P>
<P>
 For many, the situation was reminiscent of the first few days after the quake, 
when employees had turned the parking lot into an outdoor clinic. 
</P>
<P>
 "Here we are again, only this time, we've had practice," said Gretchen 
McGinley, the health center's chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sweat poured out from under her T-shirt, which read "Earthquake 1994." "I feel 
like writing 'Return of' in big letters on my shirt," she said, laughing 
ruefully as she prepared to order two truckloads of drinking water.

U.S. REIMPOSES LAW TO ALLOW TRADE SANCTIONS ON JAPAN; MARKETS: SUPER 301 
MEASURE PERMITS PUNITIVE TARIFFS AGAINST NATIONS FOUND TO DEAL UNFAIRLY. SUCH 
ACTION COULD DEVASTATE O.C., WITH JAPAN ITS BIGGEST TRADE PARTNER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Triggering a storm of protests from Japanese leaders, President Clinton on 
Thursday reinstituted a provision of U.S. trade law that will allow the United 
States to retaliate against Japanese imports if Japan fails to open its markets 
to American goods. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure will allow the Administration to impose trade sanctions, such as 
punitive tariffs, against any country found to engage in unfair trade practices 
that keep U.S. products out of its markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Delays built into the process, as well as the Administration's plan to 
gradually turn up the pressure on Japan, make it unlikely that the measure, 
known as Super 301, would have a tangible impact on the cost of Japanese 
products in this country unless the trade dispute continues to fester until the 
end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 That is good news in Orange County, where business leaders stress that Japan 
is the county's single largest trade partner and warn that a wide-scale trade 
war could be devastating to the fragile local economy, which is only just 
beginning to recover. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not sure this will go that far," said Donald Miller, president of the 
World Trade Center Assn. of Orange County. "Anything (Administration officials) 
do, I hope, will be minor." 
</P>
<P>
 Like other business leaders monitoring the growing trade dispute, Miller said 
Clinton was right to point out disparities in trade with Japan and to try to 
work toward solving longstanding issues. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would agree they need to open up their market to certain products to create 
a more level playing field," Miller said. 
</P>
<P>
 He quickly added, however, "I don't think this is the best way to do it." 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Wilck, past president of the Orange County Chamber of Commerce, agreed 
that Clinton inevitably had to "raise the ante" by reinstituting Super 301. 
</P>
<P>
 "The chamber is certainly in favor of supporting free trade," Wilck said. But 
he echoed Miller in saying he hopes that, for the sake of Orange County's 
economic future, Super 301 is never used. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, there is significant symbolic impact in the decision, which U.S. 
Trade Representative Mickey Kantor announced after Clinton spoke earlier in the 
day by telephone with Japanese Prime Minister Morihiro Hosokawa. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's action followed the breakdown of trade talks between 
President Clinton and Hosokawa last month. It brought a warning of trouble to 
come from Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 Chief Cabinet Secretary Masayoshi Takemura, the top government spokesman, said 
today that this kind of "unilateral" measure is "explicitly prohibited" by the 
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Japan, he said, "strongly hopes that 
the government of the United States will act in a sensible manner," but also 
"recognizes the need for a restrained response." 
</P>
<P>
 Takemura noted that the government has recently "reaffirmed its intention to 
advance voluntary measures toward further market opening." 
</P>
<P>
 Super 301 expired in 1990, two years after Congress enacted it as part of 
comprehensive trade legislation. But the Administration has said that it has 
the authority to reinstate it by presidential order. 
</P>
<P>
 During its earlier use, it provoked deep opposition among the Japanese. 
Although sanctions were never applied, U.S. officials said that, with varying 
degrees of success, it pushed Japan into increasing purchases of U.S. 
satellites, some wood products and supercomputers. 
</P>
<P>
 The toughened trade regulation, which is to remain in effect through 1995, is 
one in a series of steps contemplated by the White House to pressure the 
government in Tokyo to open its markets to U.S. products. In 1993, Japan ran up 
a $59.3-billion trade surplus with the United States, and a $131-billion global 
trade surplus. 
</P>
<P>
 Simultaneously with the new trade action, the Clinton Administration moved to 
use antitrust measures to combat Japanese practices judged to inhibit sales of 
American goods in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 In a speech to the Japan Society in New York, Anne Bingaman, assistant 
attorney general for antitrust, said the Administration would take legal action 
against monopolistic practices in Japan and by Japanese companies operating in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Bingaman noted that Japan has promised for years to stop organizing industry 
cartels that exclude foreign competitors. "But, after all is said and done," 
she said, "the question still remains whether there has really been any 
meaningful change in Japan." 
</P>
<P>
 As for the decision to reinstate Super 301, it represented a clear signal to 
Japan, in the wake of the breakdown in trade talks, that the Administration 
will make it more and more costly for the Hosokawa government to back away from 
an agreement its predecessor made with Clinton last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Japan agreed to negotiate a system by which progress could be 
measured in opening the Japanese market to the United States in four areas: 
automobiles and auto parts, telecommunications, medical equipment and 
insurance. 
</P>
<P>
 The negotiations fell apart Feb. 11, hours before Clinton and Hosokawa met at 
the White House, and the prime minister is said by aides to be preparing an 
import-promoting trade proposal to be announced at the end of March. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration's procedure, spelled out in an executive order that 
the President signed Thursday, would work this way: 
</P>
<P>
 * Each year the trade representative would send to Congress a National Trade 
Estimate Report, which would list trade barriers -- quotas, tariffs and other 
procedures that countries follow to keep out foreign products. 
</P>
<P>
 * By Sept. 30, the Administration would identify the nations on the list with 
the most egregious barriers, setting in motion a short investigation after 
which tariffs, or taxes on imports, could be levied. The tariffs could be as 
high as 100% of the value of a specific import. 
</P>
<P>
 Without a list of specific countries or industries, it is impossible to 
determine where the tariffs would be applied. But a senior Administration 
official pointed out that "autos and auto parts are front and center" in the 
agreement that brought about the disrupted negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Apart from that statement, Administration officials have yet to single out 
specific industries, prompting executives at several Japanese-owned companies 
with U.S. headquarters in Orange County to say they are uncertain what effect 
Thursday's decision will have on their operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Under Super 301 terms, U.S. trade negotiators could pick and choose which 
Japanese products would face steep tariffs or be banned from entering the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 If, for instance, the Clinton Administration decides not to focus on 
electronics parts, companies such as Mitsubishi Electronics America Inc., based 
in Cypress, and Toshiba America Inc., in Irvine, would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's hard to say how the Administration will use the powers," said Tom 
Chapman, a Mitsubishi spokesman. "Hopefully, they won't have to use it at all." 
</P>
<P>
 But Kantor explained that the procedure "is a flexible instrument" that 
permits him "to send our trading partners an early warning that certain of 
their practices may be identified in the future if they are not eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
 In a written statement, Clinton said his order will help to "open markets that 
will create better jobs and increase wages at home and abroad." 
</P>
<P>
 That goal in mind, some Japanese companies with production facilities in 
Southern California have been hedging their bets. 
</P>
<P>
 At Toshiba America, for instance, the company is moving closer to complete 
independence from the parent firm in Japan, said Toshiba spokesman Bob 
Wittenberg. 
</P>
<P>
 Toshiba makes its computerized notebooks in Irvine using many locally produced 
parts, and manufactures television sets in Tennessee using picture tubes made 
in New York. Such practices protect multinational companies in the event of a 
trade war, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's important for us to have a high level of local procurement," Wittenberg 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in Japan, emotions were high. Hosokawa told Parliament that he 
hopes the United States will "take sensible action based on a sensible 
judgment." Bringing Out the Big Stick 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration, frustrated by Japan's failure to buy U.S. goods, wants to 
force Japan to open its markets by reinstating a provision of trade law known 
as Super 301. What Is Super 301? 
</P>
<P>
 Under the provision, the U.S. trade representative prepares a list of 
countries that have erected the most egregious trade barriers against American 
products. After further investigations, the Administration has the power to 
impose retaliatory tariffs of up to 100%. Consumer Impact 
</P>
<P>
 It is unlikely the measure would have a tangible impact on the cost of 
Japanese products in this country unless the dispute festers until the end of 
the year. But U.S. companies, primarily autos and auto parts, stand to achieve 
major gains if markets open. U.S. Trade Deficit with Japan

QUAKE JOLTS FAITH IN STEEL FRAME BUILDINGS; DISASTER: ABOUT 20 ARE NOW KNOWN TO 
HAVE BEEN DAMAGED. ENGINEERS CALL FOR INSPECTIONS TO SEARCH FOR HIDDEN FLAWS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With the tally of steel frame buildings found to have suffered cracked girders 
and welds in the Northridge earthquake continuing to rise, experts Thursday 
called for random inspections to assess the nature and scope of the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The number of buildings where steel frame elements failed in the Jan. 17 quake 
is now thought to be about 20 and is growing as more owners order in-depth 
reinspections. Engineers said the potentially dangerous cracks may not be 
visible unless parts of walls and fireproofing material around steel columns 
and beams are removed. 
</P>
<P>
 Engineers also told a meeting of the state Seismic Safety Commission in 
Burbank that, because the internal failures caused by the recent quake were 
often obscured, steel frame buildings in the San Francisco Bay Area should be 
checked for damage that might have occurred in the 1989 Loma Prieta earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Steel frame buildings are supposed to bend with the forces of an earthquake 
without breaking and, if properly designed and constructed, are still thought 
to be among the safest of modern structures. But engineers say a number of 
these buildings, ranging geographically from West Los Angeles to the Santa 
Clarita Valley, did not perform as expected in the Northridge quake.  
</P>
<P>
 "There's no reason to push the panic button," said Helmut Krawinkler, a 
Stanford University expert on steel frame buildings and earthquakes who 
stressed that none of the damaged buildings came close to collapsing. "We don't 
have a disaster, but we have a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Krawinkler said three types of steel frame buildings that together comprise a 
majority of the commercial structures and high-rises erected in recent decades, 
had girders and welded connections that fractured in the quake. The damage to 
so-called moment-resisting frames was the most widespread and the most 
surprising, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know how many (damaged steel frame buildings) are out there," said 
Krawinkler, who was part of an engineering reconnaissance team that studied the 
effects of the quake. "That is our immediate concern." 
</P>
<P>
 At the least, he said, all steel frame buildings that suffered any damage 
should be thoroughly checked, even though each inspection would be "very, very 
time consuming and expensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Fratessa, an Oakland-based structural engineer who serves on the 
commission, said the cracked frames do not represent an immediate threat to 
safety, but he endorsed the call for more inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 If initial findings indicate a need for a systematic study, Fratessa suggested 
that banks, insurance companies, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and 
building owners could help pay for it. "As opposed to taxing the people of 
California to do something for a few select owners, I think it will be in the 
interest of the owners themselves . . . to do this," Fratessa said. 
</P>
<P>
 Several engineers have suggested that badly designed beam-to-column 
connections or poorly executed welds could have caused the cracks. And others 
have said that the quality of the steel involved may be suspect. For now, 
however, the focus is on determining the extent of the damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Charles C. Thiel Jr., a Bay Area structural engineer who heads the California 
State University system's seismic review board, said that as many as five new 
or nearly new steel frame buildings on the Cal State Northridge campus may have 
cracked girders or welds. But officials there did not even begin looking for 
the problem until there had been several aftershocks. 
</P>
<P>
 The aftershocks caused disproportionate damage to the Oviatt Library, so 
engineers began searching for hidden weaknesses in the building. That is when 
they found that numerous four-inch-thick steel plates at the base of columns 
had split. Now cracks are showing up in the engineering, student union and 
education buildings, which are still under construction. 
</P>
<P>
 "What is so troubling about this is that it's much more insidious," Thiel 
said. "The normal signs of damage are not there."

HEARINGS SET ON LAPD SEX HARASSMENT; POLICE: COUNCILWOMAN GOLDBERG SAYS SHE HAS 
HEARD COMPLAINTS FROM MANY OFFICERS. SHE WILL LAUNCH A PUBLIC INQUIRY INTO 
ALLEGATIONS MARCH 16. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Alarmed by reports of extensive and entrenched sexual harassment in the Los 
Angeles Police Department, City Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said Thursday that 
she will launch public hearings later this month to assess the scope of a 
problem that LAPD officials acknowledge is serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am holding these hearings because anecdotally, the number of women officers 
and male officers who have called this office, who have complained, is 
sufficient for me to be absolutely convinced there is a problem," said 
Goldberg, who heads the council's Personnel Committee. "That and the fact that 
the leadership of the department doesn't deny that a problem exists." 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg's comments came a day after The Times -- citing court records, 
internal police documents and interviews with police officers and others -- 
reported that sexual harassment has until recently received little attention 
from department management. Among other things, The Times reported that in the 
last five years, there have been at least eight cases of female LAPD employees 
alleging sexual assaults by co-workers. The Times also reported that the LAPD 
only began last year to compile records of sexual harassment cases, logging 43 
complaints, five of them for alleged assaults. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said she expects to begin the hearings March 16, adding that she 
believes Police Chief Willie L. Williams and leaders of the Los Angeles Police 
Protective League will testify. She also expects current and former officers to 
describe alleged incidents of harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg and her staff already have conducted a number of preliminary 
interviews. During those sessions, Goldberg said, she had been told "that there 
is an extensive and entrenched problem with sexual harassment, that large 
numbers of women officers believe it is not useful to complain because the 
people they complain to are buddies of the people they complain about, that an 
environment hostile to women is tolerated in the department (and) that Internal 
Affairs investigations frequently are simply a whitewash." 
</P>
<P>
 "These are the things we are being told," Goldberg said. "Can I tell you I 
know this all to be true? No. That is why we are having the hearings." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite widespread complaints of a department culture that has tolerated 
harassment, a number of officers -- men and women alike -- say that it is 
partly due to a collision of old ways and changing cultural expectations. One 
management expert said some friction could be expected when women assume larger 
roles in a once-predominantly male institution such as the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the department's 7,600 officers, about 1,200 are women. 
</P>
<P>
 "PrimeTime Live," an ABC News program, aired interviews Thursday night with 
two of the female LAPD officers who allege that they were raped by male 
officers. "I tried to do everything I could," one of the female officers said 
on the program. "But he was much bigger and stronger than me. . . . Never did I 
think another officer would hurt me, but he did." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, two members of the Los Angeles Police Commission said they would 
support Williams' call for a special unit to investigate harassment and 
discrimination complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to see it up and running yesterday," said Gary Greenebaum, president 
of the five-member civilian commission, adding that he believed the proposal 
would be approved by the entire commission. "I've learned that everything in a 
department such as this takes time . . . but I would hope that within a few 
months we could have this in place." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Wednesday, Williams said he would recommend that the unit be 
given the authority to investigate complaints of harassment, discrimination or 
bias. It would conduct its inquiries separately from the LAPD's Internal 
Affairs Division, which has traditionally handled such complaints. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm extremely supportive of the concept," said Art Mattox, another member of 
the commission. "I certainly think that it would be a very positive way to send 
a message that no harassment based on gender, ethnicity or sexual orientation 
will be tolerated in this department." 
</P>
<P>
 Based on research and interviews conducted by the councilwoman and her staff, 
Goldberg said she does not believe the 43 LAPD cases -- or the six settlements 
of sexual harassment lawsuits reported by the city attorney in the last several 
years -- reflect what is occurring in the department. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am telling you that the number of cases does not represent the depth of the 
problem," Goldberg said. "First of all there are many cases in the wings 
waiting to be filed. We know that from law firms contacting this office." 
</P>
<P>
 Further, Goldberg said, interviews suggest that officers, male and female, are 
discouraged from filing complaints of harassment. "So I would say they (the 43 
cases) represent a much larger number of (incidents) . . . because these are 
women who know what happens to women who complain and are still willing to 
complain." 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department, which has about 
20% more employees than the LAPD, reported 32 complaints of sexual harassment 
last year. Sheriff's officials said none of the cases involved rape or sexual 
assault. 
</P>
<P>
 Commending the LAPD for its recent audit of the West Los Angeles station, 
Goldberg on Tuesday urged the council to authorize similar sexual harassment 
audits of every city department. That proposal will come before the council 
Tuesday. And regardless of its fate, Goldberg said, she will hold hearings on 
sexual harassment within the LAPD. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make clear to everybody that sexual harassment is not acceptable 
in the LAPD," she said.

FEMA SEEKS FORECAST

<P>
 The Federal Emergency Management Agency has asked scientists to estimate 
future seismic shaking in Los Angeles, Orange and Ventura counties to help the 
government decide where to spend money devoted to earthquake mitigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Buck, a FEMA official, said Thursday the estimates will be used to 
decide how much money should go toward strengthening public buildings that were 
damaged in the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 No repair projects will be scrapped even if the estimates show a high 
probability of future quake damage, he said. But decisions on earthquake 
mitigation measures that go beyond code requirements would be affected, Buck 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthquake scientists who have been working since 1992 to calculate the 
probability of future quakes are participating. Their reports will be used to 
help analyze the benefits and costs of specific repair projects. A Sacramento 
consulting firm, Goettel & Horner, will do the analysis. 
</P>
<P>
 This is apparently the first time that the panel of scientists from various 
California universities and the U.S. Geological Survey, working under the 
auspices of the Southern California Earthquake Center at USC, has prepared 
probability estimates that will have a direct effect on how a government agency 
chooses to spend money on stemming quake hazards. 
</P>
<P>
 The project was revealed at a Thursday news briefing at the Earthquake Center. 
Many of the scientists have said that the probability of big earthquakes in the 
Southland has been increased by the 1992 Landers quake and the Northridge 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneth Goettel, a geologist who is a partner in the Sacramento firm, said the 
study will provide estimates on the quake risks in 65 zones of urban Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you only have money to mitigate hazards in one building, you may do it 
where the highest risk is," Goettel said. "But you might decide to move the 
building to a less risky area, or that the risks are too high to justify the 
costs." 
</P>
<P>
 Goettel and FEMA emphasized that perceived quake risks would not be the only 
factors used in allocating the mitigation money. Political factors, including 
the desires of local officials to emphasize certain projects, such as seismic 
reinforcement of the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, are also considered. 
</P>
<P>
 "We also ask how many lives will be saved by mitigating hazards at specific 
locations," Buck declared. "That is one method of determining what is most 
worth spending money on."

RIORDAN NAMES 2 DEPUTY MAYORS TO COMPLETE STAFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles Mayor Richard Riordan appointed a former Bill Clinton fund-raiser 
and an Eastside business owner as deputy mayors Thursday, filling out the top 
posts in his fledgling Administration. 
</P>
<P>
 The appointments of Mary Leslie as deputy mayor for economic development and 
Sofia Garcia-Conde Zuckerman as deputy mayor for finance and administration 
bring to six the number of deputy mayors reporting to Riordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Mayor Tom Bradley had just two deputy mayors, although his overall 
staff was larger. 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie, an official with the U.S. Small Business Administration and a 
fund-raiser for President Clinton during the 1992 campaign, will coordinate 
local business recruitment, retention and expansion. She fills a vacancy left 
by Al Villalobos, who resigned in December after six months on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 Riordan's campaign pledge to invigorate the city's business climate has 
emerged as one of his toughest tasks, complicated by the lingering recession 
and a large city budget deficit. Leslie will also use her Washington contacts 
to assist Riordan in his dealings with the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 "Economic development is a critical area," said Jack Kyser, chief economist 
for the nonprofit Economic Development Corp. of Los Angeles County. "It is not 
just luring big firms here, but it also means retaining your business base and 
helping existing entrepreneurs thrive." 
</P>
<P>
 Zuckerman, a successful furniture store owner who supported Riordan during the 
campaign, becomes the highest-ranking Latino in the Administration. Four of 
Riordan's six deputy mayors are women; African Americans, Latinos and gays are 
also represented. 
</P>
<P>
 Zuckerman, who was appointed by Riordan to the Recreation and Parks Commission 
last year, will advise the mayor on budgetary and fiscal matters and handle the 
paperwork routed through the mayor's office from the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The increased staffing comes after a tumultuous period in which a handful of 
Riordan aides resigned or were asked to leave, a turnover that Riordan 
characterized as typical for a new organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "This pretty much rounds out the Administration," William McCarley, Riordan's 
chief of staff, said of the new appointments. "But that doesn't mean that we 
won't continue to evolve in the years ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Other staffing announcements include three new assistant deputy mayors: 
Reginald Jones-Sawyer, a city employee who was past president of the Los 
Angeles Assn. of Black Personnel; Caprice Young, a former aide at the 
Metropolitan Transportation Authority; and David Michaelson, an attorney and 
former aide to Los Angeles County Supervisor Ed Edelman. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Fidel Vargas, the 24-year-old mayor of Baldwin Park, will become 
a senior policy analyst for public safety, and Kimberly Dupree, an attorney, 
will join the mayor's field staff in south and central Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Next week, a new press secretary will join the staff. Noelia Rodriguez, who 
had worked in the communications office of Southern California Edison, replaces 
Annette Castro, who became chief deputy to Councilman Richard Alarcon.

SOUTH GATE PARENTS OUTRAGED BY ARREST OF POPULAR TEACHER; EDUCATION: SUPPORTERS 
SAY RAYMOND JETT JR. IS THE VICTIM OF FACULTY RIVALRIES. HE IS CHARGED WITH 
MAKING THREATS TO CO-WORKERS AFTER BEING ACCUSED OF HAVING A HANDGUN IN HIS 
CAR. 
</P>

<P>
 There were expressions of outrage when South Gate parents gathered Thursday 
outside a kindergarten classroom whose teacher has been charged with 
threatening to gun down his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents aren't angry with teacher Raymond Jett Jr., though. They are furious 
at those who have accused him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jett, 36, was arrested last week on suspicion of having a handgun in his car 
at the Montara Street Elementary School faculty parking lot. After posting 
bail, he was arrested again after allegedly making threats to co-workers he 
felt were responsible for turning him in. 
</P>
<P>
 The parents contend Jett is innocent of those criminal charges and is the 
victim of unbridled rivalry among teachers at the Montara Street campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think this could be a setup," said Maria Hernandez, whose 6-year-old 
daughter was taught by Jett two years ago. "Ever since I've known him they've 
been trying to get rid of him." 
</P>
<P>
 Jett was known for the good rapport he maintained with both pupils and parents 
at the mostly Latino campus, said Sonia Duran, whose 5-year-old son wrote a 
letter Thursday to send to the jailed teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a great teacher," she said. "I think the other teachers are jealous of 
him." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez and Duran were among a dozen parents who paused outside the campus 
gates to talk about the misfortune they say has befallen Jett. 
</P>
<P>
 Several complained that school officials have refused to discuss Jett's arrest 
for fear of causing a backlash among parents. Jett's 32-pupil kindergarten 
class is on a year-round school schedule that goes on a lengthy vacation break 
starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "They won't tell us anything. They're just leaving us guessing," said Duran. 
"We asked at the school office, they said we'd get a letter in the mail. I 
still haven't gotten it." 
</P>
<P>
 Jett was arrested Feb. 24 after someone apparently told Principal Juliana 
Dawson that he had a handgun in his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Jett was released later that day on a $20,000 bond. But that 
night he telephoned a substitute teacher at the school and threatened to "mow 
down" those responsible for his arrest, according to prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
 He was rearrested a week ago and remains in jail in lieu of $750,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 But accusations that Jett threatened to kill anyone ring hollow with the 
kindergarten parents who say they know Jett best. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lies! Lies! Lies!" is the way Carmen Lopez put it. 
</P>
<P>
 "He wouldn't even let the children bring toy guns for Christmas presents. He 
wouldn't let them in the classroom," said Maria Villarreal. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our hearts, we know he's right. He's not a bad man at all." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Jett has been described by others as a war enthusiast who collects 
guns and sometimes re-enacts Civil War battles, the kindergarten parents 
characterized him as a gentle man who was unruffled even by noisy young 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very loving and caring, a father figure," Hernandez said. 
</P>
<P>
 "He gave me his home number in case my son had problems with homework," Duran 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it wasn't for Mr. Jett, my boy wouldn't be speaking English," Maria 
Gutierrez said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And if Jett had a handgun in his car, there was probably a reason for it, 
added Maria Ovalle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he needed to defend himself. This can be a rough area," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 As their parents defended their teacher, 5-year-olds Sergio Duran, Jesse 
Ramirez, Carlos Hernandez, Vanessa Cabrera, Ricardo Villarreal and Elizabeth 
Melgoza milled about, clutching drawings and letters they had prepared for 
Jett. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, they ran to the school fence and began shouting in unison: "We want 
Mr. Jett! We want Mr. Jett!" 
</P>
<P>
 Inside, Dawson declined to discuss what she characterized as "an ongoing 
police investigation." 
</P>
<P>
 The parents said they are not finished yet, either. 
</P>
<P>
 They plan to travel together to court March 14 to show their support for Jett. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want him back," Duran said.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; GARDENER 
GETS LIFE TERM IN MURDER OF WOMAN, 78 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A part-time gardener was sentenced to life in prison Thursday for robbing and 
murdering an elderly South-Central woman who had hired him to do her yard work. 
 
</P>
<P>
 The sentence imposed on Huey Ferguson Jr. by Superior Court Judge J.D. Smith 
was automatic after a jury convicted him of the Jan. 22, 1993, murder of Ruth 
Isabel Roberts.Because the panel found true the special circumstance 
allegations of murder committed during a robbery and murder committed during a 
burglary, Ferguson could have faced the death penalty. But prosecutors chose 
not to pursue it and instead settled for life in prison without the chance of 
parole.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors contended during the weeklong trial in January that Ferguson, who 
worked for Roberts as a part-time gardener, went to the woman's home about 7 
p.m. the night of the murder. A neighbor testified he saw Ferguson pacing back 
and forth in front of the woman's home about half an hour or so before worried 
neighbors entered the residence and found her body.  
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson, who was convicted of a Louisiana armed robbery in 1974 and a 
drug-related offense, had been doing yard work for Roberts for about two years 
and had worked for her on the day of the murder.  
</P>
<P>
 The 78-year-old woman, known affectionately in the neighborhood as "Baby 
Ruth," was stabbed and hit in the face and then strangled.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN FERNANDO VALLEY; NO 
DRUGS FOUND IN BODY OF YOUTH AFTER FATAL RAMPAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Troubled teen-ager Christopher Golly was not under the influence of drugs or 
alcohol when he shot his father to death and then ambushed Los Angeles police 
with a military-style rifle, killing rookie Officer Christy Lynne Hamilton, the 
county's top medical examiner said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Golly killed his father, called police to his Northridge home by calling 911 
to report the slaying, and then opened fire on them before ultimately killing 
himself early Feb. 22.After Golly's suicide, there was widespread speculation 
among friends and classmates that the youth's rampage was the result of his use 
of methamphetamine, a drug that can cause users to become violent and 
temperamental. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles County's chief medical examiner-coroner, Dr. Lakshmanan 
Sathyavagiswaran, said blood tests indicated that the 17-year-old had no 
alcohol or drugs of any kind in his system -- not even residual levels -- on 
the day of the shootings.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: 2 LAPD OFFICERS PLEAD 
NOT GUILTY TO FIRING ON CHP OFFICER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two Los Angeles police officers pleaded not guilty Thursday to charges they 
shot at a California Highway Patrol officer last month while he wrote a 
speeding ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers Michael Herrera and Ted Teyechea, both 30, stood silently with their 
hands clasped in front of them during the afternoon hearing.Their pleas were 
entered by their attorneys. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys admit the pair shot firearms to "let off steam" while 
driving in a pickup truck along a freeway, but deny that they aimed at CHP 
Officer Scott Wall. "It will be found to be a reaction to pent-up stress over a 
long time that came out when they were drunk," attorney William Hadden, who 
represents Herrera, said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
 "Absolutely they're sorry, they're embarrassed, they're scared to death," said 
Barry Levin, who represents Teyechea. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Susan Steinfeld called the case "as serious as it gets, 
taking two semiautomatic weapons and firing them 16 times on a crowded freeway 
in the afternoon." 
</P>
<P>
 Wall reported that he was fired on by someone in a passing pickup Feb. 9 while 
he was writing a ticket to a motorist on the Harbor Freeway in Gardena. No one 
was injured. The officers were arrested after their pickup became mired in a 
traffic jam on the Artesia Freeway.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: COMPTON; 4 RAP ARTISTS 
TO PERFORM AT BENEFIT FOR HIGH SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Four gangsta-rap artists have agreed to perform at a benefit concert later 
this month at Centennial High School in Compton to help the school pay for the 
upcoming yearbook and various extracurricular activities. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert was announced this week by Compton Mayor Omar Bradley, who has 
criticized rap lyrics that have obscenities and negative depictions of blacks 
and women.Bradley said he hopes to arrange other fund-raising concerts in the 
area if the Centennial effort is successful. Tickets are $10 per person. 
</P>
<P>
 The rappers who will perform at Centennial at 7 p.m. on March 23 are Deon 
(Dee) Barnett and Kelton (K.K.) McDonald of the group 2nd II None; Crawford 
(Hi-C) Wilkerson, and David (D.J. Quik) Blake. All are Centennial alumni. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley praised the rappers for giving back something to the community. "We 
want people to know that gangsta rap has made a slight turnaround," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 At a City Council meeting last October, Bradley criticized rap artist Eric 
(Eazy-E) Wright, who sought a permit to produce a local video. The next day, 
Bradley announced an agreement in which Wright would produce a video giving 
Compton a positive image.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES COUNTY; 
APPLICATIONS FOR QUAKE AID TOP 400,000 MARK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The record number of applications received for local, state and federal 
disaster assistance programs in the wake of the Northridge earthquake has 
topped the 400,000 mark, it was announced Wednesday.  
</P>
<P>
 According to the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the previous record for 
the most applications for assistance in a single U.S. disaster was 304,000 
after Hurricane Hugo in 1989.To date, the Jan. 17 earthquake has generated 
403,492 applications. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has issued 121,000 checks totaling more than $330 million in grants for 
temporary housing and emergency repairs. More than $2.5 million has been 
provided through the California State Individual and Family Grant program, 
which provides emergency funds to people who are not adequately covered by 
insurance or other aid programs. 
</P>
<P>
 The Small Business Administration has approved low-interest disaster loans 
totaling nearly $216 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, because of the high volume of requests for help, Friday's 
application deadline for the federal and state Mobile Home Minimal Repair 
Program has been waived. The sign-up period was extended until further notice. 
The program applies to mobile-home owners whose units were damaged or destroyed 
by the quake or its aftershocks. Call (800) 887-4253 for English assistance or 
(800) 997-4253 for Spanish.

DELAYED MAGNET SCHOOL FORMS RAISE ANXIETIES; EDUCATION: APPLICATIONS FOR THE 
PRIZED PROGRAMS ARE OVERDUE BECAUSE OF CHANGES AFFECTING GRADE LEVELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BETH SHUSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A rite of spring in the Los Angeles Unified School District -- receiving and 
returning applications for the highly prized magnet schools -- will be delayed 
a month, prolonging the tension for parents and students and complicating plans 
for next fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay is due to a snafu over a district plan to regroup grade levels at 
many schools. The Board of Education, which already approved a plan in 
principle to make grade-level changes, needs to vote on specific schools -- 
including many magnets. The vote is scheduled for next week. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district typically issues its magnet application brochure -- called 
Choices -- to parents no later than Valentine's Day. Parents would have a month 
to apply and would be notified of acceptance by mid- to late May. This year, 
however, parents probably will receive the brochure by March 18, the 
application deadline will be mid-April, and acceptance notices won't be out 
until mid- to late June. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnet school principals say they are getting calls from parents who are 
nervous about not having received the applications and about the late 
notification. 
</P>
<P>
 "The birds come, the leaves come out and the Choices brochure comes," said Bob 
Reimann, the principal at Sepulveda Middle School, which has a magnet for 
gifted and high-ability students on its campus. "Everyone's anxious because the 
time has been delayed. We're getting eight or 10 calls a day about it." 
</P>
<P>
 The district has 108 magnet schools, many of which offer specialized 
educational programs and racially integrated settings. About 37,000 of the 
district's 640,000 students attend magnet schools. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the district expects to receive about 38,000 applications for 
10,000 openings in magnet schools. But students already in the program get 
priority, as well as students who have been on the waiting list.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents say they are worried about the late notification. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all feeling anxious because it may be into summer before we know," said 
Diane Siegel, a Northridge parent who has two children in Balboa Elementary's 
Gifted/High Ability Magnet. Siegel's son will be in seventh grade next year, 
and she is looking for a middle school magnet program. 
</P>
<P>
 For parents who are considering other opportunities for their children, the 
June notification will conflict with private school deadlines. 
</P>
<P>
 "The longer things drag out, the longer other deadlines will intrude on this," 
said Steve Schneider, a parent with a child at the Sepulveda magnet. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Michaud, headmaster at the John Thomas Dye School in Bel-Air, said the 
elementary school typically receives about 250 applications for 50 openings. 
About half of those applicants are parents in the Los Angeles Unified School 
District. And John Thomas Dye, along with about a dozen other private schools 
in the area, have April deadlines for parents to formally enroll their children 
in the school. 
</P>
<P>
 Other private schools have later deadlines -- but most require parents to 
commit before June. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials say they needed to iron out the details of the grade level 
changes before they could put out the application brochure.  
</P>
<P>
 "There is such volatility around this that we don't dare make any mistakes," 
said Richard Battaglia, the district's magnet school coordinator. "It's not 
ideal, but there was no way we could put out something incorrect." 
</P>
<P>
 All district schools will eventually be reconfigured so elementary schools 
serve kindergarten to fifth grades and middle schools serve sixth to eighth 
grades.

CULTURAL DEFENSE IN WIFE'S DEATH; COURTS: ATTORNEY SAYS IRANIAN IMMIGRANT 
SNAPPED BECAUSE HIS SPOUSE CHALLENGED HIS MANHOOD. BUT PROSECUTION PORTRAYS HIM 
AS A CALCULATED KILLER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Trapped by his culture in a dysfunctional marriage and psychologically abused 
for decades, Iranian immigrant Moosa Hanoukai snapped and killed his wife in a 
crime of passion, his defense attorney said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the opening of Hanoukai's trial in Van Nuys Superior Court, prosecutors 
portrayed him as a calculating killer who deserves life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake is whether Hanoukai, 55, spends the rest of life behind bars or is 
guilty of manslaughter, which carries a maximum penalty of 11 years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney James E. Blatt said he will use a cultural defense and show 
that Hanoukai's wife challenged her husband's manhood for 25 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Browbeaten by his wife, forced to sleep on the floor and prevented from 
getting a divorce, Hanoukai erupted at his Woodland Hills home March 20, 1993, 
Blatt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense considers this case a tragedy of a married couple involved in a 
dysfunctional relationship," Blatt said. "Due to cultural and religious 
grounds, they were unable to get a divorce." The relationship, he added, 
"finally ended in a night of tragic violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Although he apparently tried to cover up the slaying, Hanoukai soon confessed 
to an acquaintance that he bludgeoned his wife, Manijeh, prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 Blatt said he plans to present evidence showing that Manijeh Hanoukai violated 
norms of the tightly knit Iranian Jewish community of which she and her husband 
were members, and will show the psychological abuse Hanoukai endured. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense is confident that we can present our witnesses and this homicide 
will be shown to be a manslaughter -- that it was in the heat of passion, that 
it was not premeditated or with malice," Blatt said. 
</P>
<P>
 In her opening statement, Deputy Dist. Atty. Kathleen M. Cady painted a 
picture of a man who went out of control after a domestic dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her injuries were many skull fractures," Cady said, describing the beating 
the victim received. "She died because her body lost so much blood." 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy determined that Manijeh Hanoukai died of blunt-force trauma to the 
head, but no murder weapon was found, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The prosecutor promised the jurors that they would hear testimony indicating 
that after beating his 100-pound wife to death, Hanoukai completely dressed the 
corpse, stuffed it in a trash bag and left it in the garage of their Margarita 
Drive home. 
</P>
<P>
 While admitting the couple had a stormy relationship, Cady said Hanoukai would 
not turn himself in to police until he had consulted an Iranian attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple's 25-year-old daughter, Delaram, testified that her parents were 
unhappy throughout their relationship, and that her mother controlled the 
family's finances. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have said that Manijeh Hanoukai controlled several bank accounts -- 
totaling well over $200,000 -- and her daughter was named as the beneficiary of 
the bank deposits and a life insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Delaram Hanoukai told the jury about one fight between her parents in the 
family's Huntington Park clothing store, where Moosa Hanoukai shook his wife 
and threatened "to smash her head."

SHERIFF'S DEPUTY ARRESTED IN PURCHASE OF COCAINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who had been under surveillance for 
about a month was arrested after trying to buy a kilogram of cocaine from an 
undercover officer on a Downtown street, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 William Barr, 25, a 4 1/2-year veteran of the department, was arrested about 
2:15 p.m. Wednesday near Alameda and Macy streets, said Deputy Larry Mead, a 
Sheriff's Department spokesman.Detectives later found two 9-millimeter 
semiautomatic handguns in Barr's car, Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his arrest, Barr worked as a jail deputy at the North County 
Correctional Facility, one of five jail facilities that house more than 10,000 
inmates at the sprawling Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic, Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal unit had learned through an anonymous tip that Barr had inquired 
about a possible cocaine purchase, Mead said.  
</P>
<P>
 Barr was booked on suspicion of possession of cocaine for sale and was being 
held on $100,000 bail, Mead said.

 Nothing sleepier, nothing dreamier than a lazy afternoon in a suburban mall. 
This is where aimlessness is an art form, idle reflection passes for mental 
gymnastics and forgetting about the outside world is a God-given right. 
</P>
<P>
 By all outer appearances, that's how it was Thursday afternoon at The City 
Shopping Center in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 And yet, it is still in the air. It would be too melodramatic to call it fear. 
This isn't one of those "Terror in the Mall" dramas. You probably can't even 
call it despair. No, it's more just a sense that here's one more place that you 
can't absolutely, positively guarantee will be free from violence. 
</P>
<P>
 It was just last Sunday night that 23-year-old Dagoberto Carrero was gunned 
down inside the Century City Center Theatres. The theater complex is outside 
the mall, and Carrero was working as a private security guard -- a job that is 
supposed to be no more complicated than controlling crowds and keeping 
loiterers away. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a job that paid him seven bucks an hour. Seven bucks an hour and he died 
over it. 
</P>
<P>
 Police think they have the man who shot him. The cops say the killing was in 
retaliation for something Carrero said or did to the guy a few weeks earlier at 
the theater. 
</P>
<P>
 A shooting inside a movie lobby isn't the way we like to picture our world. 
</P>
<P>
 David is a ticket-taker at the theater. He says that although some employees 
still are shaken by Carrero's death, things are getting back to normal. 
</P>
<P>
 But normalcy has a new definition from now on. "I've been here five years and 
the worst thing we've ever had is somebody threw a rock through the window," 
David says. "Now it's gone from throwing a rock to somebody getting shot." 
</P>
<P>
 I mention that Carrero died for not much more than minimum wage. "My thing is 
that he lost his life over a dollar-fifty," David says, referring to ticket 
prices. "What it was, (Carrero) probably threw the guy out and asked him to 
leave. For a buck-fifty, this is sad." 
</P>
<P>
 In another part of the mall Thursday, security guards Tim Elder and John 
Garzone talked about the changing nature of their job. "You just can't trust 
anybody anymore," Elder says. "It seems like everybody wants revenge." 
</P>
<P>
 Garzone said the days when mall security could take the safety of their jobs 
for granted is gone. "Sometimes when you go up to people, you've got to wonder 
what's going to happen," he says. "It makes me think twice because you just 
don't know what's going to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 The guards at The City are unarmed, which is how Elder wants it. He says he 
would probably quit if the job required him to carry a gun. 
</P>
<P>
 By any measure, the Orange mall is relatively trouble-free, they say. The 
biggest concerns are with shoplifters or the occasional rowdy youngsters. It 
used to be that just seeing their security guard uniform would be enough to 
thwart troublemakers; now, unarmed guards like Elder and Garzone have to make 
snap judgments on whether to force the issue with someone or not. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Bancroft, who owns the Patrol One security firm that employed Carrero, 
recognizes that dilemma, too. Since Carrero's death, he says, he has retained a 
psychologist to help his employees with techniques to keep troublemakers from 
turning a situation into a personal vendetta. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does that make a difference with one guy with a gun?" Bancroft asks. "I doubt 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 It's not lost on Bancroft that his employees have additional burdens in 
today's social climate. "They look like authority figures (with the uniforms), 
like a police officer. Therefore, they're a target for people of the mentality 
of the guy who shot Carrero. And yet, they're unarmed -- for their protection 
and the public's. They are target status but with no defense to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Bancroft says his firm has logged 5 million hours of guard work in the last 20 
years "and there's been nothing even resembling this (Carrero's shooting). The 
slaying, he says, is "statistically insignificant, but personally and humanly 
very significant." 
</P>
<P>
 I think Bancroft put his finger on the mood we all have nowadays. 
</P>
<P>
 Intellectually, we know theaters and malls and restaurants and churches and 
schools are safe. Statistically, that is. 
</P>
<P>
 But while we know crime doesn't occur everyplace , it can occur anyplace. It 
doesn't happen all the time but it can happen any time . 
</P>
<P>
 And that's what makes us nervous. 
</P>
<P>
 It's what makes Carrero's death all the more maddening. By any rational 
yardstick, it should never have happened. But can any of us can say we're 
shocked that it did? 
</P>
<P>
 We're left with the sad-but-true summation of David the young ticket-taker at 
Century City, as he reflects on the shooting: "It'll probably never happen 
again," he says.

ANAHEIM STING DELIVERS THE GOODS; LAW ENFORCEMENT: A SIX-MONTH UNDERCOVER 
INVESTIGATION CULMINATES IN DOZENS OF ARRESTS FOR TRAFFICKING IN STOLEN 
MERCHANDISE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Police raided dozens of homes, apartments and motels Thursday and arrested 24 
people in the culmination of a six-month undercover investigation targeting 
stolen-goods merchants, burglars, auto thieves and other street criminals. 
</P>
<P>
 Dubbed GNAT Catcher -- for "Gang Nuisances and Thieves" -- by the Anaheim 
Police Department, the operation recovered more than $450,000 in stolen goods, 
police said. Also, 49 arrests were made before Thursday and 30 people already 
in custody were charged with additional crimes, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers had been posing since last fall as "fences," or buyers of stolen 
goods, making contact with more than 100 people who were willing to sell stolen 
merchandise, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope that this sends a message to the crooks that they need to be careful 
about who their fence is," said Sgt. Craig Hunter, the operation's supervisor. 
"If they know they can't trust anyone to be their fence, maybe they'll stop 
stealing." 
</P>
<P>
 Almost all of those arrested are "professional thieves" who might have made 
tens or hundreds of thefts before being caught and could account for a good 
portion of the $24 million in goods stolen in Anaheim annually, Hunter said. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you work an operation like this, you learn that stealing is the sole 
source of income for these people," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The raids began early Thursday morning. Anaheim police, assisted by officers 
from Garden Grove, the Orange County Sheriff's Department, the county probation 
and parole departments and the state Department of Corrections, hit locations 
in West Anaheim, Garden Grove, Westminster and Midway City. 
</P>
<P>
 At one hotel in Westminster, police were looking for Cody Hildreath, 35, who 
authorities said had agreed to meet an undercover officer in the parking lot to 
sell him a stolen Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
 As officers gathered behind a moving van parked outside his room and prepared 
to barge inside, Hildreath came strolling out, his denim jacket flung over one 
shoulder. Officers, their guns drawn, ordered him to the ground. After 
handcuffing Hildreath, officers sat him against a wall and, to confirm his 
identity, compared his face to a mug shot they had with them. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cody, my man, you've shaved," Anaheim Officer Lee Smith said, noticing that 
the cleanshaven Hildreath had a beard in the photo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Looking good!" Smith said, slapping Hildreath on the shoulder as if they were 
good friends. "By the way, you're under arrest." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know," Hildreath mumbled. 
</P>
<P>
 The police on Thursday also got some unexpected arrests, or "freebies," as 
Hunter called them. 
</P>
<P>
 In one instance, the girlfriend of a man arrested in the sweeps earlier in the 
day called the undercover officer who had been posing as his fence. Not knowing 
he was a police officer, she told "the fence" that she needed bail money for 
her boyfriend and had a stolen flatbed truck she wanted to unload for $500. 
</P>
<P>
 The undercover officer agreed to make the deal in a parking lot at Beach 
Boulevard and Lincoln Avenue around noon. 
</P>
<P>
 A few minutes after noon, the truck pulled into the lot. The undercover 
officer spoke to the two men inside, inspected the truck and then gave the 
signal for other officers to swoop in. The two men and the woman, who was at a 
nearby motel, were arrested. Police said the truck had been stolen in Orange. 
</P>
<P>
 When someone expressed surprise that the suspects had been willing to part 
with a truck worth at least $10,000 for a fraction of that price, Hunter noted 
that it happens all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "If they complain, we say, 'How long did it take you to steal it? Ten 
minutes?' " Hunter said. " 'If we pay you $500, that's the equivalent of $3,000 
an hour.' Crooks buy that all the time."

YOUTHS STEER STRAIGHT WITH PRIDE, KAYAKS; SANTA ANA PROGRAM BUILDS ESTEEM AND 
SKILLS THROUGH RECREATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALICIA DI RADO, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 David Eucevio was soaking wet after an hourlong kayaking workout, and his 
slender, 11-year-old body was covered in goose pimples brought on by a chilly 
wind whipping through Newport Bay. 
</P>
<P>
 Did he want a sweat shirt? "No," he said. Did he want to join his friends 
rowing back to shore? "No." He shook his head. 
</P>
<P>
 At the risk of freezing, David wanted to get back in the water and paddle a 
few extra laps before he had to go home. 
</P>
<P>
 David and his seven or eight friends, who attend Santa Ana intermediate 
schools, trek to Newport Beach by van twice a week to perfect their abilities 
at a sport they once thought they'd never do: kayaking. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths come from neighborhoods where they're exposed to gangs, so they 
have been recruited to join a Santa Ana after-school program called Project 
PRIDE, or Parks and Recreation Inspire Dignity and Esteem. The project 
encourages them to stay in school and away from gangs.  
</P>
<P>
 Free kayaking sessions for the youths started in July. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is their first exposure to anything like this," said Lucy Santana, 25, 
one of the program's coordinators.  
</P>
<P>
 Youths gain role models through the program, and they can channel their 
competitiveness and energy into sports instead of gangs, said Santana, who grew 
up in Santa Ana.  
</P>
<P>
 The participants can also hone their balance, test their reflexes and meet 
other teen-agers from across the county in occasional weekend competitions on 
the placid waters at Newport. 
</P>
<P>
 On a recent afternoon, several staffers from PRIDE and the Newport Aquatic 
Center boarded a motorized launch to follow the kids who paddled from the 
center -- located between Upper and Lower Newport bays -- southwest to the 
Coast Highway bridge for a warm-up. 
</P>
<P>
 Francisco (Paco) Morales, 20, stood on the side of the speeding launch to 
watch the youths rowing near him. He noticed Maribel Pineda's shiny, white 
kayak was constantly tilting to her left, so he cupped his mouth to yell: 
"Maribel! Move over." 
</P>
<P>
 She flipped her short black hair and shot Morales a glare, but scooted a few 
inches to balance her craft.  
</P>
<P>
 "That's it, get angry!" Morales said in Spanish, teasing 12-year-old Maribel 
for pouting. Maribel, a Willard Intermediate student, tried to hide a smile and 
picked up speed, cruising by the two-story pink stucco homes and palm trees 
that overlook the water.  
</P>
<P>
 Sam Couch, a Newport Beach athlete who trains at the aquatic center, 
volunteers on Mondays and Wednesdays to put the youths through repeated 
minute-long sprints on the water. They pump the oars quickly, stopping only for 
breath before heading off again. 
</P>
<P>
 "Catch and glide! Catch and glide!" Couch urged as he skippered the launch 
beside them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Kayaking isn't just about playing, noted 26-year-old Gus Garcia of Santa Ana, 
who encouraged the youths as he cut across the murky water on a surf-ski. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not all fun all the time," Garcia said. "It's about being responsible 
for going up and washing the boats afterward -- they know it's all part of 
their fun time." 
</P>
<P>
 When the youths fall out of the kayaks, water enters the boats. There's no 
choice but to swim and drag them back to shore to empty them out. 
</P>
<P>
 "They get frustrated when they fall," but it builds discipline and motivates 
them to avoid falling the next time, Garcia said. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales, a part-time second-grade teacher at James M. Guinn Elementary School 
in Anaheim, said he likes to mentor the youths. Occasionally, he playfully 
teases them. When Morales encouraged Jose Jimenez, 13, to stand up in his canoe 
and lift his oar above his head, Jose tumbled into the water with a splash. 
</P>
<P>
 "Paco! Look what you made me do," Jose gurgled. 
</P>
<P>
 Morales laughed: "He always says that." 
</P>
<P>
 Because Jose has mastered the kayak, he's now trying his hand at the canoe -- 
a more difficult craft that demands strength and balance. "Jose would tip over 
the canoe for weeks when he just started," Morales said. But through 
persistence, he got over the hard part, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I won first place in my race last weekend" among junior canoe paddlers, Jose 
said. "I'm the only one that can do this." 
</P>
<P>
 Although David is the smallest of the group in stature, he's the biggest 
competitor and is trying to catch up to Jose's skill level so he can paddle a 
canoe too. He's only 11, but he tells people he's 12 because he wants to seem 
older and better. "I want to beat that guy," David said, pointing to another 
kayaker. 
</P>
<P>
 During a recent race at Newport, David didn't stop when he passed the finish 
line -- he kept going until he reached the Coast Highway bridge. That earned 
his older friends' respect. 
</P>
<P>
 "He always wants to do more than anybody," Morales said. "When he learns 
something, he wants to learn more."

JURY VOTES DEATH IN SEX-MURDER; COURTS: TIMOTHY DEPRIEST, WHO KILLED A YOUNG 
FOUNTAIN VALLEY MOTHER, ALREADY FACES A LIFE SENTENCE IN HIS HOME STATE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RENE LYNCH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County jury recommended the death penalty Thursday for a Missouri 
drifter with a history of sexual assaults and violence who savagely beat and 
then murdered a young Fountain Valley mother while stealing her car. 
</P>
<P>
 Timothy DePriest, 33, already faces a life sentence in his home state for 
shooting a police officer and sexually assaulting a woman. He showed no emotion 
Thursday, bowing his head as the jury of seven women and five men concluded 
that he should die for his crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Described by a prosecutor as a "predator and bottom feeder" who earned the 
death penalty with his savagery, DePriest was convicted earlier this month of 
robbery, attempted rape and murder in the December, 1989, slaying of Hong Thi 
Nguyen, 26, who worked as a bridal shop seamstress in Garden Grove. 
</P>
<P>
 Nguyen was on her way home to breast-feed her infant daughter when DePriest 
targeted her at random, Deputy Dist. Atty. Christopher J. Evans said. 
</P>
<P>
 DePriest beat Nguyen in the face and head before dumping her nude body 
alongside a trash bin behind a Garden Grove pharmacy. 
</P>
<P>
 After shooting Nguyen once in the head, DePriest took the woman's car -- which 
still contained her baby's car seat -- and drove to Missouri, paying for the 
cross-country trip with checks and credit cards he found in Nguyen's purse. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors, who began deliberating late Tuesday, said their decision was a 
difficult one. They said they felt sympathy for DePriest -- who was physically 
abused as a child and had drug problems -- but his crimes convinced them death 
was the appropriate punishment. "It was pretty tough," said Frank Cota of 
Garden Grove. But in the end, he said, "it was the escalation of his exploits" 
that swayed the jury's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was hard to see remorse, that was the crux of it," Cota said. "The young 
lad had a hard life, but we've all had tough times." 
</P>
<P>
 Jury foreman Alan D. Baker said DePriest's criminal history was a key factor 
in their decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did feel those things were heinous and led us to the decision we made," he 
said. "The crimes were just so egregious." 
</P>
<P>
 During closing arguments, defense attorneys pleaded with jurors to spare 
DePriest's life. They told jurors that he was abandoned as a child by his 
mother, an alcoholic who cared little for her son's welfare, and even used 
drugs with him. 
</P>
<P>
 DePriest's fate now lies in the hands of Orange County Superior Court Judge 
Everett W. Dickey, who must decide whether the jury's recommendation is 
appropriate. He scheduled sentencing for May 27. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender William G. Kelley said he wants the judge to set aside 
the jury's decision and said he believes there are several issues that can be 
pursued on appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's hurting, he's down," Kelley said of his client. 
</P>
<P>
 Kelley and Deputy Public Defender Lewis W. Clapp had argued to jurors from the 
start that DePriest was not guilty of the charges against him, and instead 
blamed the murder on another man. 
</P>
<P>
 DePriest's wife, who met and married him after his incarceration, wept when 
the jury's verdict was announced, and declined to speak to reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 DePriest has a long criminal history. At the time of Nguyen's murder, he was 
on parole for a rape conviction in California. He also had committed an earlier 
rape, Evans said. While in Missouri after Nguyen's murder, he attacked a woman 
and then injured a police officer who tried to capture him. He was sentenced to 
life in prison plus 57 years for those crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorneys citing the cost and court time had criticized prosecutors 
for seeking the death penalty against a man who already faced life in prison. 
But Evans said there is always the possibility DePriest could be paroled. 
</P>
<P>
 Outside of court, Evans said the jury's decision confirmed his feelings that 
DePriest deserved the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt from Day 1 the jury would see the case this way," said Evans.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: NEWPORT BEACH; CITY TO HOLD PUBLIC MEETING AT LIBRARY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB ELSTON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council will hold a special public meeting March 11 in the Newport 
Center Library's community room to discuss the city's budgetary outlook, city 
officials said Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will begin at 8 a.m. and last all day, City Manager Kevin J. 
Murphy said, adding that it is a continuation of the special meetings held Jan. 
14 and 15 at the Balboa Bay Club. 
</P>
<P>
 Those Balboa Bay Club meetings have caused a minor controversy among at least 
two residents who have claimed that the city did not properly notify the 
public. Murphy said that the council had publicly adjourned the Jan. 10 meeting 
to the Balboa Bay Club four days later and then held the meeting at the club 
with "the door wide open and the agenda at the back" of the room. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was not a secret meeting," Murphy said. "Far from it." BOB ELSTON

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; BROADCASTS OPEN WORLD OF SCIENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Estancia High School freshman Melissa Inouye temporarily traded the sunny, dry 
fields of Costa Mesa for a catwalk high in the humid treetops of a rain forest 
in Belize. 
</P>
<P>
 She is part of an international project designed to excite students about 
science and technology. 
</P>
<P>
 The 14-year-old honor student is to arrive in Belize today to help scientists 
collect insects in the rain forest and measure minerals in cave water as part 
of the fifth annual Jason Project. 
</P>
<P>
 The project, the brainchild of Robert D. Ballard of the Woods Hole Institute 
in Massachusetts, conducts live broadcasts of educational scientific 
expeditions via satellite to nearly a half million students in the United 
States, Canada, the United Kingdom and Bermuda. 
</P>
<P>
 "Science is my favorite subject," Inouye said as she thumbed through a thick, 
black binder stuffed with information about the lizards, snakes, frogs, iguanas 
and other critters she will encounter in her 10-day stay in the jungles of 
Belize, which border Guatemala and Mexico's Yucatan peninsula. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I'm going to see some maggots (too)," she said, crinkling her nose.  
</P>
<P>
 Inouye is one of 25 students chosen to participate in the project, and is the 
only one in this year's group from the West Coast.  
</P>
<P>
 Her main task will be to set bug traps and to study caterpillar larvae that 
burrow through leaves to create their homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Other students will help excavate an ancient Mayan township and study a coral 
reef off the coast of Belize where scientists believe increased exposure to 
ultraviolet rays are "bleaching," or killing sections of the reef. 
</P>
<P>
 Students have the chance to talk with the scientists via computer linkups, and 
the answers are broadcast to viewers.  
</P>
<P>
 In Laguna Niguel on Thursday, 11-year-old Darren Chadra of Niguel Hills Middle 
School stepped up to a computer at the Edwards Ocean Ranch Cinema and asked an 
archeologist what items were most commonly found in the dig at the Mayan ruins. 
</P>
<P>
 The 300 children at the theater and others around the world watched and 
listened as the archeologist in Belize described the pots, jars and other 
household items his team had discovered at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great way to see science," Chadra said of the interactive video 
broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 His classmate, Tim Sampson, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was kind of cool because you got to see all this stuff that you 
don't really get to see around Southern California, like frogs and stuff."  
</P>
<P>
 The broadcasts will continue through March 12 and are open to the public, said 
John Tobiczyk of the Orange County Marine Institute, which is sponsoring the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 "It looks like something from the future," Tobiczyk said of the approximately 
40 video monitors used to transmit the broadcasts. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives students the opportunity to experience the absolute latest in 
technology," he said. MARY LOU PICKEL

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LOS ALAMITOS; TRUCK BAN FAILS TO SATISFY RESIDENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The City Council has approved a ban on heavy trucks along certain sections of 
Catalina and Cherry streets. 
</P>
<P>
 But residents say the action was not enough to solve the traffic and noise 
problems in their neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Trucks weighing more than four tons will also be barred from portions of Pine 
and Reagan streets to minimize traffic in a residential neighborhood that abuts 
a light-industrial area. The ban is expected to lessen truck traffic by 60%, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs will soon be posted to alert truck drivers, officials said. The council 
unanimously approved the ban this week. It will take effect in 30 days, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is not a complete solution," said Mayor Anthony R. Selvaggi. "But it's 
the first step to find a solution. This is better than doing nothing." 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two years, residents have complained about noise, dust and 
traffic created by trucks owned by Barr Lumber Co. and Trend Offset Printing. 
</P>
<P>
 Two residents, Lew Petix and Russ Iiams, sued Trend Offset Printing and the 
city of Los Alamitos in August seeking $2.5 million in damages for what they 
contend were disruptions to their lives and the city's failure to enforce city 
codes. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit is pending in Orange County Superior Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Petix and Iiams were among half a dozen residents who complained Monday that 
the ban did not include an area on Cherry and Catalina streets used by heavy 
trucks and forklifts from Trend Offset Printing. 
</P>
<P>
 Trend produces TV Guide, other magazines and government forms in an 
eight-building compound on Cherry and Catalina streets, near where Petix lives 
and Iiams owns a property. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want the trucks out of Cherry Street," Petix said after the council 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 According to a recent city traffic study, Trend creates about 40% of the truck 
traffic. Barr Lumber Co., at Los Alamitos Boulevard and Catalina Street, 
dispatches an average of 35 trucks a day, the study indicated. 
</P>
<P>
 The ban will not affect the operations of Trend or Barr, officials said, but 
it will limit the number of heavy trucks passing through the surrounding area. 
</P>
<P>
 Police will be asked to enforce the ban, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, residents said it was not good enough. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't agree with a 90% solution," said Leticia Aguilar. "I believe the 
trucks should be eliminated 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said the intention is to ease traffic congestion without 
hurting the businesses in the area. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; 2 STUDENTS' DRAWINGS APPEAR IN CALENDAR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Drawings by two Irvine students appear in the Metropolitan Water District's 
1994 "Water Is Life" calendar. 
</P>
<P>
 Both students' drawings, selected from hundreds of submissions, deal with the 
importance of water conservation. Lisa Wright, a fourth-grader at Santiago 
Hills Elementary School, has her work on the March page of the calendar. Turtle 
Rock Elementary School sixth-grader Quang Vang's artwork appears in the 
calendar's introduction. 
</P>
<P>
 The Metropolitan Water District selected a total of 23 drawings for the 
calendar. Students from Ventura to San Diego submitted materials. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think it's something to have two winners from Irvine," said Marilyn Fisher, 
community education coordinator for the Irvine Ranch Water District, which 
passed along Wright and Vang's drawings to the MWD.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; PARENTS TO GET OPEN ENROLLMENT LEAFLETS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JON NALICK 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To better inform parents about new open enrollment options, the Garden Grove 
Unified School District will be distributing brochures describing the 
application procedures. 
</P>
<P>
 The brochures, written in Spanish, English, Vietnamese and Korean, will 
explain how open enrollment will work during the coming school year. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Education revised district attendance boundaries in January and 
under the new rules, parents may choose which schools their children will 
attend next September. These choices are subject to space availability and 
other conditions, said spokesman Alan Trudell. 
</P>
<P>
 The pamphlets will include application deadlines, student transfer procedures, 
and appeal steps. Students may attend any school in the district that has space 
so long as no neighborhood children are displaced. Children will be receiving 
the brochures at school and will bring them home within the next few weeks, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Requests for transfers within the district must be submitted to the Child 
Welfare and Attendance Office by May 1. 
</P>
<P>
 If the number of requests exceeds the available space at a campus, a random 
drawing will determine priority and space on a waiting list. Parental choice 
applications submitted after May 1 will be placed on the waiting list in the 
order received, Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Students will be permitted only one transfer selection each school year. 
However, the district will accept additional transfer requests for reasons 
relating to child care, parent employment location, and providing a child with 
a specific instructional program not offered at the local school. Those 
transfer requests will be given priority provided they are submitted by May 1, 
Trudell said. 
</P>
<P>
 No district transportation will be provided for students attending schools 
through transfers. 
</P>
<P>
 The Garden Grove School District serves most of Garden Grove and portions of 
Santa Ana, Anaheim, Westminster, Cypress, Stanton and Fountain Valley. 
</P>
<P>

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; MAN ARRESTED AGAIN IN MOTHER'S MURDER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG HERNANDEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The son of a 76-year-old woman found dead in her San Clemente home 18 months 
ago has been arrested -- for the second time -- in connection with her murder, 
the Orange County Sheriff's Department announced Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford L. Burgess, 45, who has a history of mental illness, was arrested a 
few hours after the Sept. 6, 1992, slaying of Mary Burgess but was released the 
following day due to lack of evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 But forensic evidence recently uncovered has linked Burgess to the crime, 
Sheriff's Lt. Dan Martini said. Burgess surrendered to authorities Wednesday 
and will be arraigned today for the murder, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The case has always continued to be under investigation," Martini said. 
Burgess "apparently had remained in the area. There wasn't any intention on his 
part to hide." 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess called police dispatchers on Sept. 6, 1992, and told them he had found 
his mother dead. He also said he had tried to commit suicide after finding her. 
When officers arrived at the house, in the 200 block of Avenida Cabrillo, they 
found blood throughout the home. Burgess, who had cut both of his wrists, was 
arrested but never charged, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 An autopsy determined that Mary Burgess had died of suffocation, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clifford Burgess' attorney, Jack Earley, said Thursday that his client has a 
long history of severe depression and has been in and out of mental hospitals 
since his mother's death. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a very tragic case," Earley said. Burgess "has severe emotional and 
psychiatric problems and was depressed at the time of the slaying. There had 
been a number of crises in his life." 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities would not detail the new evidence but said it was collected at the 
scene and re-evaluated after the merger last year of the San Clemente Police 
Department and the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 Between his arrests, Earley said, Burgess had cooperated with the police and 
the district attorney's office, making himself available for physical tests and 
surrendering this week. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been hard for him to go on with his life not knowing when or if he was 
going to be taken into custody," said Earley. 
</P>
<P>
 Earley said he expects to enter a not-guilty plea on behalf of his client at 
the arraignment today in Orange County Municipal Court. 
</P>
<P>
 Burgess is being held at Orange County Jail on $250,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 "Obviously, there is ample evidence in this case, and it is probably a classic 
case of not guilty by reason of insanity," Earley said.GREG HERNANDEZ

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; 20 SHERIFF DEPUTIES OUT WITH 'BLUE FLU' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT LAIT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 About 20 sheriff's deputies participated in a "blue flu" job action Thursday 
to protest an eight-month-long contract dispute with the county over wages and 
benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for rank-and-file deputies called the demonstration a success and 
promised similar protests every week until the county improves its contract 
offer. 
</P>
<P>
 "The county needs to get the message," said Robert MacLeod, general manger of 
the Assn. of Orange County Deputy Sheriffs. "This shows them that the deputies 
are dissatisfied." 
</P>
<P>
 County officials said the job action did not affect police service and would 
not affect negotiations. Currently, the Sheriff's Department has no plans to 
investigate the deputies for improper use of sick leave, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The action had no effect on our protection of the communities. If there was 
any impact it would be financial," said Lt. Dan Martini, noting that the 
department had to pay overtime to deputies filling in for those who called in 
sick. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies have been working without a contract since last October. 
Negotiators from the association and county have been meeting since August to 
reach a new contract. 
</P>
<P>
 MacLeod said the protest was kept small because the deputies did not want 
their actions to have "any adverse impact on the public." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a quarrel with the public. We believe they support us," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The protest occurred during the day shift and was held in the department's 
North Division, which includes Rossmoor, Midway City and Lemon Heights. Eleven 
patrol deputies and 10 detectives called in sick. The deputies were told to 
call in sick several hours before their shifts so the department would have 
enough time to replace them in the field, MacLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's 1,300 members overwhelmingly supported the job action, 
MacLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
 The deputies are asking for a three-year contract with a 3.5% pay raise for 
the second and third years. The deputies are not asking for a raise in the 
first year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to be sympathetic to the county's alleged financial plight," 
MacLeod said. 
</P>
<P>
 The county has offered 3% raises for the second and third years. Additionally, 
MacLeod said, the county is not sufficiently funding the deputies' medical and 
other benefits. 
</P>
<P>
 Judy Davis, chief of employee relations, declined to discuss the negotiations. 
She said that union officials have not formally rejected the county's offer but 
acknowledged that Thursday's protest was "definitely an indication" of their 
displeasure.MATT LAIT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; STUDENT PAPER CHAIN IS ONE FOR THE BOOKS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TERRY SPENCER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jessica Cramer and the 560 other students at Albert Schweitzer Elementary 
School stretched their chain of paper links through and around the school 
Thursday until the school was surrounded. 
</P>
<P>
 And while stretching the chain wasn't much of an accomplishment, what went 
into making the chain was.Each of the chain's 11,983 links represented a book a 
student or teacher had read since the beginning of the school year. 
</P>
<P>
 Katie Radomski, the school's reading specialist, said the project's goal was 
to challenge the students to read without giving them a material reward. In the 
past, students have received pizzas and even money for reading. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to get them to read for the sake of reading," Radomski said. "We want 
to show them that reading can be fun." 
</P>
<P>
 She also said the chain showed the students how much reading other people do. 
</P>
<P>
 "After we stretched out the chain, we had the students walk the entire length 
of the chain so they could see just how many books were read," Radomski said. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jessica, a 10-year-old fourth-grader, is an example, Radomski's plan 
worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best part (of the project) was that it was fun reading the books and 
seeing the chain grow around the classroom," she said.TERRY SPENCER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; WASTE SITES CLEANUP TERMED NO THREAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERT ELJERA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Col. Guido Portante, commander of the Los Alamitos Armed Forces Reserve 
Center, assured residents this week that the cleanup of potential waste sites 
inside the base does not pose a health threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Portante said that a preliminary study has identified 12 sites where soil 
contamination exists, but hazardous substances have not been found and there is 
no contamination of drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 About 35 residents living around the 1,300-acre base attended Wednesday's 
meeting at Los Alamitos High School to hear Portante and other base officials 
discuss the cleanup plans. 
</P>
<P>
 Portante said that federal law requires military installations across the 
country to comply with environmental guidelines set by the U.S. Environmental 
Protection Agency.  
</P>
<P>
 "It seems like good housekeeping," said Shirley Baily, president of the 
1,200-member Rossmoor Homeowners Assn. The base "is trying to provide better 
pollution management, and we're supportive of what they're doing," Baily said. 
</P>
<P>
 In a report mailed to residents of Los Alamitos, Rossmoor, Seal Beach, Garden 
Grove, Cypress and Westminster, environmental planner Troy Hardin said the 
cleanup sites include buildings and landfills that have not been used for some 
time. Among them are underground storage tanks, a waste water treatment plant 
closed in the 1960s, a rifle and pistol range and an area near the airfields 
used for aircraft maintenance, washing and fuel storage. 
</P>
<P>
 Hardin said a consulting firm, Clayton Environmental of Cypress, has been 
hired to investigate the waste sites. The investigation may take a year to 
complete, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a slow and complicated process," Hardin said. "We want to be thorough 
because we don't want the EPA to order us to do it all over again." 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Michael Wells, the project manager, said that preliminary studies have 
cost $300,000 so far, but he could not say how much the cleanup will cost. He 
said costs will depend upon the extent of the contamination, which won't be 
known until after the investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, Wells said, there is no indication of leaks from the 
contaminated sites. 
</P>
<P>
 The base was used for 30 years as a naval air station, providing training for 
fighter and bomber units. In 1972, it became the Armed Forces Reserve Center, 
operated by the California Army National Guard. 
</P>
<P>
 It houses the Governor's Office of Emergency Services, which responds to 
natural disasters, and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Medfly Project.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FOG TO HANG AROUND AGAIN THIS MORNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK I. PINSKY 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The early morning fog that blanketed coastal Orange County on Wednesday and 
Thursday is expected back today, according to WeatherData, which provides 
forecasts for The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 An area of low pressure about 700 miles to the southeast is creating an 
onshore flow of moist marine air, according to meteorologist Bruce D. Thoren of 
WeatherData.As the night air cools, the moisture in the air condenses and fog 
develops, he said. The fog may continue through the weekend, Thoren said.  
</P>
<P>
 The forecast for today calls for morning clouds and patchy fog, giving way to 
partly sunny skies, with some low cloudiness, later in the afternoon. Farther 
inland, Thoren said, particularly in the canyons, the morning fog should 
diminish. 
</P>
<P>
 In Newport Beach, this morning's low is expected to be 50 degrees, with an 
afternoon high of 61. Santa Ana is expected to have a morning low of 49, with 
the mercury rising to 76. MARK I. PINSKY

 Connie Hines, co-star of the "Mr. Ed" television show, will be a celebrity 
judge at the first Tails and Whales Wag-a-Thon. 
</P>
<P>
 The event, to be held in conjunction with the Festival of Whales on Saturday, 
will benefit the Animal Rescue Foundation, a local group that helps find homes 
for stray pets. 
</P>
<P>
 There will be two-kilometer and four-kilometer walks. Walkers with pledges of 
more than $200 will qualify for a drawing for a trip to San Francisco. Several 
other prizes, ranging from hotel packages to dinners and entertainment passes, 
will be given away. 
</P>
<P>
 Participants can either walk their favorite pet or walk alone. Event 
organizers noted that surrogate pets can be found for anyone who wants a 
partner for the walk. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'll provide a pet for anyone who needs one," said event co-chairwoman Mary 
Obenberger. "And the pet can be taken home after the walk."

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FULLERTON; CROSSWALK WHERE 2 DIED WON'T CHANGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY LOU PICKEL

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A crosswalk where two trick-or-treaters were killed in October will remain 
unaltered, in spite of petitions by residents asking the city to install 
flashing yellow lights or a stop light for safety. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents of the area and schoolchildren collected about 1,000 signatures 
calling for a change after the accident claimed the lives of two girls who were 
hit by the driver of a pizza delivery car at the intersection of Orangethorpe 
Avenue and Pacific Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 A city commission studied the traffic flow at the intersection and recommended 
that the city remove the crosswalk markings from the street to discourage 
pedestrians from crossing there. 
</P>
<P>
 But resident Lena Maddox appealed the recommendation. She said the crosswalk 
markings should stay as they are, since many children and adults cross at 
Pacific Drive to go to a nearby school, bank and supermarket. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel that we should have something. Just don't take it away from us," 
Maddox said of the crosswalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Other residents told the City Council on Tuesday that children at Orangethorpe 
Elementary School regularly cross the street at Pacific Drive and will continue 
to do so whether there is a crosswalk or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's children crossing there daily," said resident Michelle Cooper. 
"Taking the crosswalk out is not going to make anything better." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper added that the street is dark at night and needs a street light. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation and Circulation Commission reviewed the traffic flow and 
pedestrian traffic at the intersection and determined on Jan. 10 that a 
stoplight was not necessary because the volume of cars and people was too low, 
Fullerton traffic engineer Paul Smith said. The council agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Oct. 31 accident, there has been one other accident at the 
intersection in the past five years, Smith said. That accident occurred in 1992 
and involved a skateboarder who suffered minor injuries when hit by a car, he 
said. MARY LOU PICKEL

 A man suspected of stealing a motor home Thursday and later taking a car at 
knifepoint was arrested after a chase and crash, Brea police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerald William Maston, 25, of Costa Mesa was taken to the jail ward at Western 
Medical Center-Anaheim for observation after the stolen Honda Civic he was 
driving along Santa Ana Canyon Road hit a tree, left the road and landed upside 
down in an eastbound lane of the Artesia Freeway, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident began when Brea police found a motor home that had been reported 
stolen earlier in Huntington Beach. It was abandoned and stuck in the sand at 
Featherly Regional Park. 
</P>
<P>
 While Officer Dave Wearp was investigating the motor home, a woman in a nearby 
home reported to police that a man with a knife had entered her home and forced 
her to give him cash and the keys to her Honda. Wearp said he saw a Honda 
driving by the park and pursued it along Gypsum Canyon Road. The Honda turned 
onto Santa Ana Canyon Road and accelerated before swerving into the tree. MARK

MANISCALCO JURY DELIBERATES SOME MORE; MURDER TRIAL: ONE DAY AFTER TELLING A 
JUDGE THEY WERE UNABLE TO REACH A VERDICT, THE MEMBERS TRY AGAIN AND ARE 
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TODAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Jurors in the triple-murder retrial of a biker gang leader resumed 
deliberations on Thursday -- one day after telling a judge they were unable to 
reach a verdict in Orange County's longest-running criminal case. 
</P>
<P>
 The Superior Court jury has been deliberating since Feb. 7 in the trial of 
lawyer Thomas Maniscalco, 48, who has been in custody 10 years, longer than any 
other defendant in Orange County history. 
</P>
<P>
 This is Maniscalco's second trial. In the first, the members of the jury 
deliberated 26 days in 1990 before concluding that they were hopelessly 
deadlocked. 
</P>
<P>
 On Wednesday, jurors in the second trial sent a message to Superior Court 
Judge Kathleen E. O'Leary saying they were having trouble reaching a unanimous 
decision. The judge sent jurors back into the jury room Thursday, and the 
members are expected to continue deliberations today. Attorneys in the case 
declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco is accused of masterminding the slaying of Richard (Rabbit) 
Rizzone, 36; Rizzone's bodyguard, Thomas Monahan, 28; and Rizzone's girlfriend, 
Rena Miley, 19, on Memorial Day, 1980, at Rizzone's home in Westminster. Miley 
also was raped. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors allege that Maniscalco ordered the execution-style killings 
because Rizzone was skimming profits from narcotics and counterfeiting 
operations run by Maniscalco. 
</P>
<P>
 But defense attorneys for Maniscalco, who is also the co-founder of a 
motorcycle gang, say their client is being framed for crimes he did not commit. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco graduated from law school in 1973 and started a law practice with 
his father -- a former New York Police Department sergeant -- to represent 
"counterculture people" in Orange County who claimed they were being harassed 
by the police. 
</P>
<P>
 During his time in custody, Maniscalco has made a name for himself by giving 
inmates pointers on their cases and lobbying for prisoner rights.  
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco's case has been delayed by a separate trial for a co-defendant, by 
appeals, by changes in judges and attorneys and by other proceedings. 
</P>
<P>
 Maniscalco originally was charged along with Daniel M. Duffy, 51, in the 
killings. Duffy was convicted of the murders in 1992 and sentenced to life in 
prison without parole. Prosecutors were seeking the death penalty against Duffy 
but abandoned that after jurors failed to reach a unanimous verdict on 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors have, therefore, also decided not to seek the death penalty 
against Maniscalco. If convicted, he would face life in prison without parole.

CYPRESS COLLEGE PRESENTS 9 WITH AMERICANA AWARDS; EVENT: THOSE WHO CONTRIBUTED 
TO THEIR COMMUNITY ARE HONORED AT BANQUET. IT WAS EXPECTED TO RAISE MORE THAN 
$100,000 FOR SCHOLARSHIPS.

<P>
 They weren't celebrities or sports figures, these nine honorees at the Cypress 
College Foundation's annual Americana Awards banquet Thursday night. 
</P>
<P>
 In years past, the college's annual celebration of American culture has 
featured such personalities as Roy Campanella, Gene Autry and Edgar Bergen as 
its special guests of honor. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year the spotlight shone instead on nine Orange County citizens who 
had fed the homeless, comforted the elderly or otherwise contributed to their 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The black-tie affair, with 650 guests and $150 seats, was expected to raise 
more than $100,000 for Cypress College scholarships, said Don Bedard, the 
foundation's executive director. 
</P>
<P>
 The college's Americana Awards were first presented in 1976 as part of the 
country's bicentennial celebration, Bedard said. The college hosted 
entertainers, considering them icons of American culture, as well as 
humanitarians. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1985, however, the foundation has honored lesser-known but deserving 
citizens who have made significant contributions to their community, while 
placing greater emphasis on using the occasion for raise funds for college 
scholarships. The event has grown so big that it had to be moved from the 
college campus to the Grand Ballroom at Disneyland Hotel in Anaheim, where 
Thursday's gathering took place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even in these difficult economic times, this event continues to be extremely 
successful," said Bill Wood, chairman of the foundation board. "These people we 
are honoring tonight represent hundreds and thousands more throughout the 
county. Many did not get the opportunity to be honored this way. But they are 
very important." 
</P>
<P>
 Peter and Mary Muth were honored as Americana 1994 Man and Woman of the Year 
for their donations to more than 75 nonprofit organizations and to Mater Dei 
High School in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're delighted," said Keith Nelson, foundation board president. "Peter and 
Mary are wonderful people. All the recipients have given so much that there is 
no way to put a dollar amount on their contributions. 
</P>
<P>
 "More and more people are coming to the front to volunteer for their 
community," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Also honored were seven members of communities served by Cypress College: Ned 
Snavely of Anaheim, Bea Botelho of Buena Park, Andrew Lachina of Cypress, 
Barbara Sulzbach of Garden Grove, Tito Romero of La Palma, Murl Fast of Los 
Alamitos and Mary Navarrette of Stanton. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you've been in a community for so long, it gives to you, and you give 
back," said Fast, who expressed surprise at being honored. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainment included the Orange Empire Chorus, an ensemble of 50 barbershop 
quartet-style singers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom K. Harris, president of the college, said of the program: "It continues to 
mature and gain support. The money we've raised is very significant in helping 
students complete their education."

RAMS GET NEW PRACTICE FIELD OFFER; SPORTS: ANAHEIM SUBMITS LEASE PROPOSAL IN 
EFFORT TO KEEP TEAM FROM BEING EVICTED BY THE SCHOOL DISTRICT THAT OWNS THE 
SITE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In an effort to prevent the Rams from being kicked out of their practice 
facility, city officials Thursday presented the team with a new lease proposal 
for the site, which is owned by a school district. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials said they hope the team will accept the offer before a March 11 
deadline imposed by Magnolia School District officials, who issued the eviction 
ultimatum because they have become frustrated with the lengthy negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
 Rams officials, however, said a quick decision on the new proposal is 
unlikely. 
</P>
<P>
 John Shaw, Rams executive vice president, said he had not seen the city's new 
offer and does not expect to have a decision until late next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still have eight days," Shaw said. "That's a long time." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said team officials have no contingency plans for a practice facility if 
they leave Rams Park, formerly Juliette Low Elementary School. 
</P>
<P>
 "We haven't really looked at it," Shaw said. "I'm sure there are alternative 
sites. We're not restricted to practicing in Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute over the practice facility has heightened concerns throughout the 
city that the Rams will move out of Anaheim after next season. Team officials 
already have indicated that they are exploring deals with other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the Rams will notify the city officially on May 3 that the team 
intends to exercise an escape clause in its Anaheim Stadium lease agreement. 
That notification allows the Rams to look elsewhere to play, but does not 
prohibit them from continuing to negotiate with Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Magnolia School District Supt. Paul Mercier said earlier this week that he 
thought the team was stalling in the practice lease negotiations until it was 
certain about its future. He said the lease essentially was completed several 
weeks ago, but the Rams have refused to sign it. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, however, said there were still several significant obstacles to overcome 
before the team would consider signing a new lease. He said the team is 
concerned over provisions in the lease that require the team to pay restoration 
costs if it leaves the practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 He also said the $250,000 penalty the team would have to pay to break the 
lease is unreasonable. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, he said the city has reneged on an offer to upgrade the practice 
facility. City officials said they have met all their obligations to the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have felt for a number of years that this facility is basically 
inadequate, and we've been led to believe that the city would look for a newer 
facility or make improvements here," Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, he said he thought a deal eventually could be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have remained optimistic over the last four years that we would resolve 
this issue. I still remain optimistic," he said. "It's hard to imagine that 
they would evict us from this facility, but I've been wrong before." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim City Atty. Jack L. White said the Rams may be evicted if they don't 
decide on the lease by early next week.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're taking a big risk," said White, who noted that to beat the district's 
deadline, the lease must be approved by the City Council on Tuesday, several 
days earlier, before the district could officially accept it. 
</P>
<P>
 Under a complicated arrangement, the city leases the property from the 
district and then sublets it to the Rams. The team has practiced at Rams Park 
since moving to Anaheim in 1980. The lease on the site expired Dec. 31, but was 
extended for one month while the parties worked to renew it. White said that if 
the Rams don't sign the proposed lease next week, "it will be out of the city's 
control." 
</P>
<P>
 White said he has not heard from Shaw about the new proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he has better things to do, like shopping his team across the country," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although White would not disclose all the details of the new proposal, he 
confirmed that it is a 10-year lease with a five-year extension option. The 
Rams could get out of the lease with six-month notice and a $250,000 payment to 
the district. The rent on the facility would be $250,000 a year, with the city 
subsidizing $120,000.

BABIES BEAR OUT NEW FERTILITY TECHNIQUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Staff reports and wire services 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Babies were recently born to two women who apparently are the first in Orange 
County to conceive using new fertility treatments that involve the injection of 
sperm directly into an egg, hospital officials reported Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Nicole Joy Tigner was born to Terry and Diana Tigner of Orange on Feb. 12 at 
Hoag Hospital in Newport Beach.The baby was the first birth at the hospital 
resulting from a variation of the technique called micro-manipulation, 
spokeswoman Maureen Mazzatenta said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're very enthusiastic because the procedure opens up a whole new level of 
fertility treatment for couples," said Dr. Lawrence Werlin, medical director of 
Hoag fertility services. 
</P>
<P>
 On Monday, a woman who had conceived using a newer micro-manipulation 
procedure at the UCI/Saddleback Center for Reproductive Health in Laguna Hills 
gave birth in her home country of Mexico, said Dr. Jane Frederick. 
</P>
<P>
 Both procedures, which have been in use for two to five years, involve holding 
the microscopic egg with a very fine pipette, a small pipe or tube, while a 
second pipette with the thickness of a human hair is used to inject or "drop" 
sperm through a small slit in the egg's outer membrane. 
</P>
<P>
 The procedures try to duplicate the fertilization process that occurs 
naturally when sperm penetrates an egg, Mazzatenta said. Fertilized eggs are 
then transferred to the woman's Fallopian tubes and allowed to continue.

COACH ACCUSED OF HAVING SEX WITH GIRL, 14 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A 29-year-old San Clemente High School coach has been arrested on suspicion of 
child molestation for allegedly having sex with a 14-year-old girl, authorities 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Andrew Earl Malone of San Clemente, who coaches baseball and basketball at the 
high school and is a geology instructor at Saddleback College, was arrested by 
county sheriff's deputies during baseball practice on Tuesday afternoon, 
according to Sheriff's Department Lt. Dan Martini. 
</P>
<P>
 The alleged victim, a San Juan Capistrano resident who does not attend San 
Clemente High, told police investigators she had sexual intercourse with Malone 
at his home in February, Martini said. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone is not a member of the high school faculty and was hired last August as 
a "walk-on" coach, said Principal Chris Cairns. Malone coached the sophomore 
basketball team last fall and was coaching the freshman baseball team when he 
was arrested at the Bonita Canyon Park ball field on Tuesday, Cairns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cairns said the players were not aware that Malone had been arrested. Malone 
has been placed on administrative leave and "will not be back on the field with 
the students until the investigation is concluded," Cairns said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cairns said he does not know Malone well, but added, "I know he was well 
thought of by the athletes, parents and other coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 Malone couldn't be reached for comment Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 He is a graduate of San Clemente High School, UC Santa Barbara and Indiana 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 He has been a part-time instructor at Saddleback College since the fall 
semester and is teaching Geology 1 this semester, a college spokeswoman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Malone appeared briefly Thursday in Municipal Court in Laguna Niguel, and his 
arraignment on one charge of child molestation was set for March 11. He is 
being held in Orange County Jail on bail of $25,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Police have asked anyone who has any information on the case to call 
Investigator Wayne Quint at (714) 647-7467.

 Trying to explain the extraordinary upheaval in global financial markets over 
the past month, some Wall Streeters are posing an intriguing question: 
</P>
<P>
 Were world stock and bond markets riding atop a dangerous speculative bubble 
before this -- and did the Federal Reserve Board understand this and vote to 
willfully prick that bubble? 
</P>
<P>
 On the surface, the Fed's decision to boost short-term interest rates by a 
quarter-point on Feb. 4, the first such credit tightening in five years, was a 
function of the U.S. economy's robust growth. The Fed wanted to preempt the 
rising inflation that often follows economic booms. 
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, the central bank was obviously aware of the 
unprecedented flow of dollars plowing into foreign stocks and bonds over the 
past six months, driving share prices up 50% to 100% and bond yields way down. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of that money, from both professional "hedge funds" run by heavily 
leveraged global traders and from mutual funds flush with dollars from average 
Americans, was increasingly being targeted at extremely high-risk emerging 
markets, from Southeast Asia to Latin America to Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Fed and other global central bankers have been quite vocal about 
their concern over the mushrooming use of often-shadowy derivative securities 
worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 Derivatives, which include options, futures and a host of related "synthetic" 
securities, allow traders to make bets on stocks and bonds with little money 
down, or to hedge themselves against market declines and thus maintain bigger 
positions in stocks and bonds than they otherwise might. 
</P>
<P>
 If Fed Chairman Alan Greenspan wanted to send a signal that would prompt big 
investors to tone down their level of speculation in red-hot markets around the 
world, including in the United States, nothing would be more effective than a 
move to tighten credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Higher U.S. interest rates, after all, immediately boost the cost of leverage 
-- the billions in borrowed bank dollars used by hedge funds and others to 
magnify their market bets. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, higher U.S. rates would be expected to stem at least some of 
the tremendous dollar flow to overseas markets, by making U.S. money market 
instruments and bonds more attractive. If the Fed were concerned about keeping 
the U.S. economy's recovery on track, one key would be to avoid sudden 
artificial shortages, including shortages of capital. 
</P>
<P>
 Did the Fed believe a bubble was forming in financial markets? Greenspan 
hasn't said so publicly, but perhaps he didn't have to. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows we've been pushing the envelope with valuations" in bond 
markets around the world, says Christopher Baker, whose C.P. Baker & Co. in 
Boston manages a small hedge fund. The Federal Reserve "was aware that people 
were drunk with this stuff." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, while the hedge funds have been blamed for sparking the dramatic 
selloffs in bond and stock markets since the Fed's rate hike, many other 
investors -- including many mutual funds -- in retrospect had made far larger 
bets than they should have on long-term bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 Just last fall, investors snapped up 100-year fixed-rate bonds from companies 
such as Walt Disney. The logic of being willing to accept a relatively low, 
fixed interest rate for the next 100 years, with all the unquantifiable 
economic risks in the interim, escaped many pros. 
</P>
<P>
 But some investors were so willing to believe the story that inflation was 
dead, and that long-term interest rates would continue to decline from what 
were already 20-year lows last fall, that the greater risk seemed to be in not 
buying bonds with the rest of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, betting on further interest rate declines in the 
recession-wracked economies of Europe and Japan appeared to make perfect sense. 
</P>
<P>
 In their defense, investors who loaded up on bonds can say that they did so 
fully expecting that the Fed would raise short-term interest rates eventually. 
In theory, by taking a preemptive strike against inflation, the Fed should have 
helped bring long-term yields down further, not push them up. That's because 
long-term yields are supposed to respond to inflation expectations, not to the 
relative level of short-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It hasn't worked out that way, of course -- at least not so far. The yield on 
30-year Treasury bonds has surged from a low of 5.79% last fall to 6.83% now as 
investors have bailed out. In Europe, bond yields have risen more than 
three-quarters of a point just since year's end, also amid wild selling. 
</P>
<P>
 Interest rates also have skyrocketed in emerging economies, even though there 
has been no change in the improving fundamentals of many of those economies. 
Ashwin Vasan, a portfolio manager at Oppenheimer Management in New York, 
calculates that Argentine fixed-rate bonds now yield 5.3 percentage points more 
than long-term U.S. bonds, compared to about 3 percentage points more a month 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 And formerly red-hot global stock markets have tumbled as bond yields have 
jumped. Hong Kong's Hang Seng stock index has plunged from 12,599.23 early this 
year to 9,802.03 now, a drop of 22%. In the United States, the Dow industrials 
have slid nearly 4%, virtually all of that drop occurring since the Fed's move 
Feb. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 In effect, even if the Fed didn't want to prick the global markets bubble, it 
now has, and perhaps with more dislocation in the world's financial system than 
the central bank, or anyone else, might have expected. It's not helping, 
either, that America and Japan are waltzing toward a trade war, further 
chilling the mood of some investors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think they (the Fed) wanted to slow down the speculation," says David Hale, 
economist at Kemper Securities in Chicago. "But I don't think they wanted to 
see a 1-percentage-point rise in long-term interest rates." 
</P>
<P>
 Which raises a disturbing question: With the bubble burst, and investors of 
all stripes suddenly looking for reasons to sell, has the Fed set off a chain 
reaction of market declines worldwide that will go much farther than logic 
would dictate? 
</P>
<P>
 Two aspects of the stock and bond markets turmoil give some veterans pause 
today: 
</P>
<P>
 * First, one of the selling points for international diversification over the 
past year was that world markets generally don't correlate -- that is, 
Americans should invest overseas because those markets often rise when the U.S. 
market falls. 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, virtually all stock and bond markets on the globe are 
slumping in value. That could cause individual investors to reconsider the 
wisdom of sending so much money overseas, the hot trend since last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 * Second, a major reason U.S. bond yields continue to rise is simply because 
the majority of investors have succumbed to the "deer-in-the-headlights" 
syndrome -- they're so stunned by what has occurred in such a short time, 
they're afraid to step up and buy, for fear of being buried under another 
avalanche of bond dumping by hedge funds and other desperate sellers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rates can't rise forever, of course. Some bond pros now say foreign bonds in 
particular are screaming buys. But in the mammoth U.S. bond market, there is no 
sign yet that enough investors are willing to bet that the process of wringing 
out speculation has fully run its course. The Jump in Yields

 Source: Merrill Lynch & Co. Trying Times on Wall Street The current tailspin 
in the world's stock and bond markets -- triggered in part by the Federal 
Reserve's raising of short-term interest rates on Feb. 4 -- has drawn attention 
to key policy makers, market players and trading strategies that may have 
contributed to the down-spiral. KEY PLAYERS 
</P>
<P>
 Alan Greenspan: The move by the U.S. Federal Reserve chairman on Feb. 4 to 
raise the so-called federal funds rate is widely seen as signaling the end of a 
period of falling U.S. interest rates and triggering the current market 
sell-offs. 
</P>
<P>
 Banks and securities houses: Big "money-center" banks such as Bankers Trust 
and J.P. Morgan that had loaned money to hedge funds also were trading on their 
own, and are said to have suffered huge losses. Big securities firms such as 
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley also have had huge trading positions. To cut 
their losses, these traders may have unloaded more of their securities, thus 
contributing to the downslide. Hedge funds: These multibillion-dollar private 
investment groups made huge bets early this year that U.S., Japanese and 
European bond yields would continue to drop and the Japanese yen would weaken 
against the dollar. But those bets have proved ill-timed, leading to billions 
of losses and heightening market volatility. Because they often borrow most of 
their money and invest in derivatives, such as futures and options, the funds 
are highly leveraged and must sell huge amounts quickly to protect their 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
 Big speculators: George Soros is perhaps the world's best known international 
market speculator and hedge fund operator. His trading operation is said to 
have lost $600 million in recent weeks. But two years ago he reportedly made $2 
billion betting against the British pound. Michael Steinhardt, another 
prominent speculator, is said to have lost hundreds of millions of dollars in 
recent weeks. WHAT TO WATCH 
</P>
<P>
 Yields: Yields on U.S. Treasury securities have risen sharply since Feb. 4., 
discouraging cuts in foreign bond yields that hedge funds had been betting on. 
Further gains in yields could snuff out the U.S. recovery and lead to further 
sell-offs in stocks. Growth: If the economy continues to grow fast -- the 4th 
quarter of 1993 saw expansion at an 7.5% rate and many analysts expect 3.6% 
growth this year -- fear of inflation will obligate the Fed d to tighten 
further by increasing short-term interest rates. That would lead to higher 
rates for some mortgages, bank CDs and other loans and investments. The markets 
respond best to slow, steady growth with minimal inflation. DOW JONES

TURMOIL IN THE MARKETS; Q&A; WHAT IT MEANS FOR INVESTORS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 What does the tumult in the stock and bond markets mean for individual 
investors? What should you do with your money? Here are some answers to these 
and other questions: 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What is happening to the financial markets? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A There's been a major selloff in both the stock and bond markets, which is 
mainly attributed to a rise in interest rates and inflation fears, triggered 
when the Federal Reserve Board on Feb. 4 opted to hike a key short-term 
interest rate (the federal funds rate) by a quarter of a percentage point. 
</P>
<P>
 Falling rates -- which helped stimulate economic growth while reducing the 
attractiveness of alternative investments such as savings accounts and money 
market funds -- had been a key reason for an almost continuous three-year rise 
in stock prices. Falling rates had also created profits for bond investors, 
because it made their bonds -- issued at higher yields -- more valuable. 
</P>
<P>
 But for many investors, the Fed's action signaled an end to three years of 
falling interest rates. And investors have been further spooked by signs of 
rising inflation, which could lead to further interest rate hikes by the Fed. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, big investors, including so-called hedge funds, have been unloading 
bonds, putting further pressure on bond prices to fall and yields to rise. 
(Yields and prices move in opposite directions.) 
</P>
<P>
 Interestingly, however, the U.S. economy is on a roll, posting strong growth 
that is reflected in higher corporate profits, consumer spending, home and auto 
sales -- factors that should boost stock prices. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Is this the start of a long slide in stock prices a so-called bear market -- 
or is this a buying opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Market experts are divided. Some say today's market is as much as 50% 
overvalued; they expect the Dow Jones industrial average to drop below 3,000 
before the correction is over. 
</P>
<P>
 Others maintain that while the market is likely to remain volatile in the near 
term, longer-term prospects look bright because the economy is gaining steam. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, nearly everyone believes this market bears close scrutiny. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q What should I do now? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A The answer depends, in part, on your investment horizon. 
</P>
<P>
 If you've got lots of time before you'll need your money, you should look 
beyond today's volatility and ask yourself two questions: Are U.S. companies 
likely to grow and prosper over the next decade, just as they have grown and 
prospered throughout the nation's history? If so, are the companies or mutual 
funds that you invested in likely to share in the positive effects of that 
growth? 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you've invested in poorly managed funds or companies, the answer is 
probably yes. In that case, don't panic. You can afford to ride out the current 
tumult. 
</P>
<P>
 But if you'll need your money within five years and cannot afford to risk any 
loss of principal, the issues are different. Seriously consider cashing in some 
investments and putting the proceeds in a bank or money market fund. The 
markets may do well over the long haul, but in the short run they can be highly 
volatile. You don't want to be in a position where you're forced to sell at a 
bad time. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q I'd like to stay invested in mutual funds and individual stocks and bonds. 
Should I adjust my mix? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Do a portfolio review, taking a realistic look at your investments to 
determine whether the fundamental reasons that you invested still hold. 
</P>
<P>
 Some stocks are likely to do well over the coming months, even if the Dow 
Jones industrial average dives. That means looking at the revenue and earnings 
prospects of companies in which you hold stock; looking at the investment 
objectives of your mutual funds, and considering the yields, credit quality and 
maturity dates of your bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q Are there any investments that look good right now? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A Some experts believe the op portunities are good in mortgage-backed 
securities. "Ginnie Mae" mutual funds look particularly attractive because the 
underlying mortgages in these funds are insured by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 When rates are falling, these funds look risky because of something called 
"prepayment risk," which boils down to mortgage borrowers paying off their 
loans early and giving you back your principal at a time when your reinvestment 
opportunities are limited. But when interest rates are rising, prepayment risk 
is slight, says Peter Van Dyke, managing director of T. Rowe Price in 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Individual stock investments may also be sound as long as investors choose 
carefully, says Richard Bernstein, manager of quantitative analysis at Merrill 
Lynch in New York. Look for companies that will do well in an improving 
economy, such as manufacturers, industrial concerns and conglomerates, he says.

GARAMENDI FAULTS INCONSISTENCIES IN HOME COVERAGE; INSURANCE: HE CALLS PREMIUM 
INCREASES EXCESSIVE AND CITES DISPARITIES IN CALCULATING REPLACEMENT COSTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Homeowners insurance in California is often unfair to consumers because of 
wide variations in how insurers calculate the cost of rebuilding a home 
following a fire or disaster, state Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, he said, some companies apply "excessive and inconsistent" yearly 
inflation figures to their policies, resulting in unauthorized increases in 
premiums. "The replacement cost and inflation cost factors for homeowners 
insurance are as mysterious and often as unfair as the scoring for Olympic 
figure skating," Garamendi said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi, a Democrat who is running for governor, pledged to investigate 
whether some companies' rates ought to be lowered, adding, "There is a strong 
possibility that some premiums are far higher than they need to be."  
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi also said he will develop new regulations requiring insurers to 
disclose their calculations to the Insurance Department and tell policyholders 
in their annual renewal notices how much the inflation and replacement-cost 
factors have increased their premiums. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the Jan. 17 Northridge quake, victims have been complaining to the 
Insurance Department, consumer advocates and the media that the policy limits 
on their homeowners coverage have ballooned dramatically in the last year or 
two, pushing up their earthquake insurance deductibles. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi's statement was based on an Insurance Department study of the 
state's 10 largest homeowners insurers, released Thursday, that shows wide 
variations in the way they calculate replacement cost and annual inflation. 
</P>
<P>
 Using an actual three-bedroom, 1,600-square-foot house in Canoga Park as a 
test case, the department generated replacement cost estimates that ranged from 
$94,000 to $205,000. Had such a home sustained quake damage, the standard 10% 
earthquake insurance deductible would have varied by as much as $11,100. 
</P>
<P>
 "This wide difference in assessments means many policyholders are paying too 
much or have an undervalued home," Garamendi said.  
</P>
<P>
 David E. Fountain, a spokesman for the Personal Insurance Federation of 
California, a trade group, said insurers are damned if they do and damned if 
they don't. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Oakland firestorm of 1991, Garamendi "complained and complained 
about underinsurance," Fountain said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the fire, insurers rushed to adjust their coverages upward to reflect 
actual replacement costs, and now they're being criticized for that, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In his remarks Thursday, Garamendi was particularly critical of State Farm, 
California's largest insurer. 
</P>
<P>
 The company used an inflation factor, supplied by a private consulting 
service, that pushed up home replacement costs 44% from 1988 through 1993, 
Garamendi said. Government economic data analyzed by Insurance Department 
investigators indicated that the actual inflation in construction costs was 
only 15% to 17% during those five years, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for State Farm said Thursday that the company did not obtain a 
copy of the Insurance Department study until late in the day and had not had 
time to analyze it.

TCI GOES WITH MICROSOFT ON INTERACTIVE TV; TECHNOLOGY: THE CABLE GIANT WILL 
FIELD-TEST A SYSTEM LATER THIS YEAR. THE COMPANIES HOPE TO LAUNCH IT 
COMMERCIALLY BY 1996. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Microsoft Corp. won a major endorsement of its approach to interactive 
television Thursday when cable giant Tele-Communications Inc. announced that it 
has chosen the software firm's system for field tests beginning later this 
year. The two companies said they hope to have a fully functioning commercial 
system running by 1996. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came just a week after the planned merger of TCI and Bell 
Atlantic Corp. collapsed, a development characterized by the parties involved 
as slowing progress toward an infrastructure of two-way communications networks 
capable of providing services such as movies on demand. 
</P>
<P>
 The TCI test, which begins in the fourth quarter of this year, will initially 
be limited to a few hundred TCI and Microsoft employees in Seattle. The tests 
will be expanded next year to include a larger base of TCI customers in Seattle 
and Denver and to test-market services. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope to play a leading role in (setting) the standard," said Craig Mundie, 
vice president of Microsoft's Advanced Consumer Technology group. "It will be 
as in personal computers: At first there will be many offerings, but after a 
short period the market will focus on a subset." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Microsoft has been criticized for being late in getting into the 
game, the company says recent developments support its more cautious approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Time Warner Inc. said Wednesday that its planned launch of an interactive 
network in Orlando, Fla., is being delayed by several months because of 
problems with equipment suppliers. 
</P>
<P>
 It is still far from clear how much consumer interest there is in the 
capabilities that interactive television can offer. Microsoft executives have 
suggested, for example, that the system might enable sports fans to pull up 
statistics on any player in the middle of a baseball game. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI's decision could have a big impact on the market for "video servers," 
systems that store and deliver movies to customers. Analysts say the market 
could be worth as much as $5 billion by 1997. While companies such as American 
Telegraph & Telephone, Oracle and IBM are working on video-server systems that 
use large, powerful computers, Microsoft's system, based on its NT Windows 
operating system, takes advantage of cheaper personal computer technology. 
</P>
<P>
 TCI is involved in an interactive services trial in Littleton, Colo., with 
AT&T and US West. Since that trial is aimed at testing demand rather than the 
technology itself, it uses a bank of videotape recorders operated by humans 
rather than computers.

 T-Bill Rates Up: Interest rates on 52-week Treasury bills rose to their 
highest level in nearly two years.The average discount rate was 4.03%, up from 
3.59% at the last auction a month ago. It was the highest rate since 52-week 
bills averaged 4.07% on May 28, 1992. The bills will carry an equivalent coupon 
interest rate of 4.22%, with each $10,000 in face value selling for $9,592.50. 
Sales totaled $16.52 billion out of bids of $43.98 billion.

 California Will List $3.3 Billion in Bonds: The state next week will become 
the first municipal bond issuer on the New York Stock Exchange in decades, 
according to state Treasurer Kathleen Brown.Most municipal bonds are traded 
through brokers, not on exchanges. Brown said the move will lead to greater 
price and credit disclosure, which regulators have been pushing. The idea is to 
make California's bonds more accessible to investors, which might lower the 
state's borrowing costs.

futures contracts on unregistered exchanges.

 Chrysler Gets Certification of Cherokees in Japan: The auto maker was awarded 
a blanket certification of its Cherokee vehicles by the Japanese government, 
enabling it to avoid one-by-one inspections of the cars sold in Japan, the 
Transport Ministry said. The U.S. auto industry has criticized the cost and 
paperwork involved in meeting Japanese certification standards, which a recent 
study found added 2.7% to 5.4% to the cost of Big Three cars sold in Japan.

 Toyota Says It Will Set Targets to Buy U.S. Parts: Toyota Motor Corp., Japan's 
No. 1 auto maker, said it is willing to set voluntary targets to buy U.S. auto 
parts, provided the United States doesn't resort to retaliatory trade measures. 
Toyota is considering a target of $6 billion worth of U.S. parts by its 1996 
fiscal year. That would include parts sold to its assembly plants within the 
States.

STOCKS FAIRLY STEADY DESPITE NEW RATE RISE

<P>
 Bond yields took another leap higher Thursday, but the stock market held 
relatively firm, boosted by buying of heavy-industry issues and smaller stocks. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's benchmark 30-year bond zoomed 
to 6.83%, the highest since mid-June, from 6.77% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow industrial average, however, closed off just 7.32 points at 3,824.42, 
and indexes of smaller stocks gained slightly on the day. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders said the latest selloff in the bond market was sparked by another 
round of inflation worries, this time triggered by the threat of U.S. trade 
sanctions against Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors fear that any U.S. action that raises the cost of Japanese exports 
to America could boost inflationary pressures in the already robust U.S. 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But even discounting the U.S.-Japan issue, it isn't surprising that potential 
bond investors continued to avoid the market Thursday, experts say: The 
market's deepest fear is that the Federal Reserve Board will soon boost 
short-term interest rates a second time, to demonstrate its resolve to rein in 
the domestic economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fed's hand could be forced by today's report on February employment. A 
larger-than-expected gain in jobs could give the central bank the excuse it 
needs to tighten credit another notch. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the bond market should eventually cheer the idea of a cooled-down 
economy, many traders say investors are showing no signs of stepping up to buy 
bonds, despite the surge in yields over the past month. 
</P>
<P>
 In the stock market, however, bargain hunters were out in force for a second 
day Thursday, providing hope that stock investors are beginning to look more to 
the positive aspect of rising corporate profits than to the negative of higher 
interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
 Losing issues outnumbered winners by just 5 to 4 on the New York Stock 
Exchange on Thursday, versus a 2-1 margin Wednesday. And in the Nasdaq market 
of mostly smaller stocks, winners actually edged losers Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyers focused on some heavy-industry issues that should fare best in a 
stronger economy. Winners included Bethlehem Steel, up 7/8 to 21 1/4; Scott 
Paper, up 3/4 to 45 3/4; Bearings, up 3/4 to 33 1/2; Fluor, up 2 3/4 to 47 1/2, 
and Clark Equipment, up 1 5/8 to 61 5/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Auto stocks closed mixed after rallying early on news of strong recent car 
sales. Chrysler rose 5/8 to 58, but Ford slipped 1/4 to 63 5/8 and GM was 
unchanged at 60 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * A rally in technology stocks helped buoy the Nasdaq market. Intel surged 1 
3/8 to 68, Dell Computer zoomed 2 1/8 to 27, Cisco Systems gained 1 1/2 to 76 
3/4 and Xircom was up 3/4 to 26 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * Energy stocks also saw demand. Chevron rose 1 1/2 to 88 3/4, Unocal added 
1/2 to 27 3/4, Ashland Oil gained 1 to 42 and Sonat rose 1/2 to 30 1/2. 
</P>
<P>
 * On the downside, many financial stocks continued to decline, victims of 
rising interest rates. Federal National Mortgage fell 1 1/4 to 80 7/8, Bankers 
Trust slid 2 to 76 1/2, Merrill Lynch lost 3/4 to 40 and NationsBank dropped 
3/4 to 47 1/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Among Southland issues, Cheesecake Factory plunged 3 5/8 to 29 3/8 after the 
restaurant chain reported disappointing earnings. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, DEP Class A shares closed unchanged at 4. The personal products firm 
sued S.C. Johnson & Son, alleging that Johnson wrongfully altered its marketing 
and sales practices prior to the closing of its sale of the Agree and Halsa 
trademarks to DEP last August. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, markets tried to stabilize. London's FTSE-100 index eased 1.6 points 
to 3,246.5. Frankfurt's DAX index gained 17.57 points to 2,037.90. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index closed off 0.75 point to 2,561.93, despite an 
early rally. 
</P>
<P>
 In commodity markets, President Clinton's threat to impose trade sanctions 
against Japan reverberated through the grain markets Thursday, sending prices 
to three-month lows. 
</P>
<P>
 At the Chicago Board of Trade, March wheat futures fell 2.75 cents to $3.39 
1/4 a bushel, the lowest prices since Nov. 10. March corn dropped 4.75 cents to 
$2.78 3/4 a bushel, and March soybeans lost 10.75 cents to $6.65 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 In currency trading, the dollar fell against the yen, slipping to 103.77 in 
late New York trading from Wednesday's 104.20, on worries about trade 
relations.

 Arco's Cleanup Fund May Be $1 Billion Short: Atlantic Richfield Co., in a 
disclosure made to satisfy new securities regulations, estimates that 
environmental cleanups could cost $1 billion more than it has set aside for 
that purpose.Many analysts expect other industrial giants will be forced to 
follow Arco's lead. Arco has already set aside $648 million to clean up a broad 
range of polluted plants. Service stations, refineries, oil terminals, chemical 
plants and landfills are among the 123 sites on the company's cleanup list.

GAO CITES CONTRACTORS' EXPENSES AS QUESTIONABLE; DEFENSE: TWO ORANGE COUNTY 
FIRMS ARE INCLUDED IN REPORT THAT ALLEGES OVERBILLING OF PENTAGON, INCLUDING 
FOR RESORT TRIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Two Orange County defense companies allegedly billed the Pentagon for hundreds 
of thousands of dollars in illegal or questionable expenses, including trips to 
exotic resorts for executives and spouses, alcoholic beverages and unexplained 
consultant costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparta Inc. in Laguna Hills and SRS Technologies in Newport Beach were two of 
eight military contractors whose government billing practices were audited by 
the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm of Congress. 
</P>
<P>
 While the report does not publicly break down the specific questionable 
expenses by company, a congressional source identified those incurred by the 
Orange County firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparta allegedly sought government reimbursement for trips to the Caribbean, 
Mexico and Hawaii. The trips reportedly were taken for annual management and 
business meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 On a trip to Jamaica for which Sparta sought $102,000 in reimbursements, 
according to the congressional sources, the company sent 151 employees to 
Montego Bay to attend its annual shareholders meeting. The employees brought 
along 112 spouses or guests, but the report does not say whether their expenses 
were billed to the government. 
</P>
<P>
 The company reportedly claimed the costs of meetings in resort areas as a form 
of incentive compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 The GAO report questions whether the government "should pay for contractor 
employees to attend business meetings at resort locations." 
</P>
<P>
 It does not specify whether the Pentagon had requested the return of any of 
the questioned expenses. 
</P>
<P>
 Sparta is also accused of illegally billing the Pentagon for meals for 
spouses, alcoholic beverages and for inadequately documented consultant fees, 
according a source familiar with the audit. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Sparta and SRS Technologies would not comment on the report 
Thursday evening and did not appear at a congressional hearing Thursday.  
</P>
<P>
 Even after Sparta was notified in 1992 of the scrutiny by congressional 
investigators, a GAO analyst said, company officials billed the government for 
$229,000 for a trip to Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
 SRS Technologies is accused of illegally billing the government for the 
personal use of a company car, alcoholic beverages, inadequately documented 
consultant costs and the company's legal costs in a lawsuit against the 
government. 
</P>
<P>
 It also allegedly billed $44,000 for a trip that 40 employees and one 
consultant to the company took to a Bermuda resort. The GAO said it considered 
this cost questionable but not forbidden by regulations. 
</P>
<P>
 "No, this is not Donald Trump's Visa bill," Sen. Jim Sasser (D-Tenn.), 
chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said in a statement. "It's the tab the 
American taxpayers are picking up for what defense contractors euphemistically 
call 'overhead.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Two GAO audits turned up $4.9 million in questionable or illegal expenses. 
That amount was in addition to $4.4 million in charges that the Pentagon's own 
contract watchdog agency had rejected.

KUDLOW QUITS BEAR STEARNS FOR NATIONAL REVIEW POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Washington Post 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Lawrence A. Kudlow resigned Thursday as chief economist of the Wall Street 
investment firm Bear Stearns & Co., saying he would take a position as 
economics editor of National Review magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 Kudlow, 46, who often writes and speaks on political and economic issues, said 
he has also been encouraged to run for the U.S. Senate seat held by Daniel 
Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.), whose term expires this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement of Kudlow's resignation came in a one-page statement saying 
that Bear Stearns and Kudlow "agreed that it is in Mr. Kudlow's best interest 
to resign." The wording sparked speculation that the firm was unhappy about his 
outside activities -- most recently, his decision to appear in TV commercials 
for Cadillac. 
</P>
<P>
 "Larry has a lot of energy and just spreads himself thin," said one analyst, 
who requested anonymity. "In today's kind of market, with things as competitive 
as they are, a guy cannot do two jobs at once. They probably told him he had to 
choose one or the other." 
</P>
<P>
 Kudlow said his decision to leave was reached mutually and that the firm had 
been "very generous and very good" to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "In some ways this is a surprise," he said. "A surprise always generates 
surprise, and people are always looking for hidden meanings. This was an 
amicable departure." 
</P>
<P>
 Before joining Bear Stearns, Kudlow was the chief economist in the White House 
Office of Management and Budget under President Ronald Reagan.

2 LAWYERS FIGHT SETTLEMENT IN PRUDENTIAL CASE 
</P>

 Two lawyers for investors in one of Prudential Securities' largest partnership 
programs have challenged a settlement in a class-action lawsuit, alleging 
Thursday that Prudential's witnesses misled the judge who approved the 
$90-million pact. 
</P>
<P>
 The settlement involves the Prudential Energy Income Funds, a group of oil and 
gas limited partnerships sold to 130,000 investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Depending on whether a stay is granted while a U.S. Court of Appeals considers 
the case, lawyers said, the appeal could significantly delay payments to 
investors. Prudential had said payments were to go out beginning in early 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Prudential spokesman William J. Ahearn said the brokerage had no comment on 
the appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The latest court action was filed by attorneys Stuart C. Goldberg of Austin, 
Tex., and Jeff D. Ferentz of Newport Beach on behalf of two former Prudential 
customers. The lawyers contend that the settlement is inadequate. 
</P>
<P>
 Goldberg said the lawyers will argue in the appeal that Prudential's expert 
witnesses lied to a federal judge in a hearing on the fairness of the 
settlement. U.S. District Judge Marcel Livaudais Jr. in New Orleans approved 
the settlement after the January hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time, Goldberg argued that there was evidence of systemic fraud by 
Prudential Securities in sales of the partnerships. Prudential witnesses denied 
the allegations. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldberg said in an interview Thursday that he since has obtained new 
evidence showing that the witnesses' testimony wasn't truthful.

 Wells Fargo Reportedly Rebuffed: Los Angeles-based First Interstate Bancorp 
rebuffed an offer to merge with Wells Fargo & Co. last week, ending speculation 
about what could have been one of the largest U.S. banking mergers, according 
to a published report.Despite First Interstate's rejection of the proposal, 
talks continued at the end of last week on possible transactions short of a 
full-fledged merger, the American Banker newspaper reported. Wells Fargo and 
First Interstate declined to comment. First Interstate, the nation's 
13th-largest bank with, $51.5 billion in assets, operates in 13 western states. 
San Francisco-based Wells Fargo, the nation's 12th-largest, with $52.5 billion 
in assets, has branch banking operations only in California.

CONSUMER AFFAIRS / DENISE GELLENE: YOUR MONEY; PAYING DEARLY UNDER RENT-TO-OWN 
PLANS

 Rent-to-own purchasing plans can more than double the cost of new appliances, 
according to a survey released Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, a trade group for the rent-to-own industry, which caters mostly to 
people with poor credit, said prices are higher in part because they include 
delivery and repair costs over the life of the contract. 
</P>
<P>
 The new survey, conducted by the California Public Interest Research Group, 
found that rent-to-own stores charge up to five times more than retail stores 
for the same item. The survey found that terms of the rental contracts implied 
an average interest rate of more than 100%, compared to an average credit card 
rate of about 18%. 
</P>
<P>
 As an example, the survey cited prices at a Rent-a-Center store in Berkeley. 
The store charged $961.26 for a 19-inch Zenith television set over 78 weeks: 
$607.93 for the set and $353.33 in rental charges. A Good Guys electronics 
store nearby charged $259 for the same set. 
</P>
<P>
 The Assn. for Progressive Rental Organizations called the survey misleading 
and offered its own comparisons. It said that when financing costs, delivery 
charges and warranty costs are included, the price gap closes a bit. The 
association said an El Paso shopper financing the purchase of a 25-inch console 
TV over 21 months would pay $1,132.95 at a rent-to-own store and $877.50 at 
Sears, Roebuck & Co. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, a Sears shopper has the option of paying $549 cash for the set and 
refusing additional delivery and warranty charges. 
</P>
<P>
 The surveys come amid a legislative battle. Rep. Henry B. Gonzales (D-Tex.) 
has introduced a bill supported by consumer groups that would regulate 
rent-to-own rates and prices. Rep. Larry LaRocco (D-Ida.) has introduced an 
industry-supported bill that would require rent-to-own stores to disclose terms 
of the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Contractor reforms: As earthquake repairs gain steam in Los Angeles, the 
Legislature is considering a slew of measures that would correct perceived 
shortcomings in how the construction industry is regulated in California. The 
legislation results from Assembly committee hearings on the industry last year. 
</P>
<P>
 The measures so far are unopposed, although that could change. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are getting a lot of questions from contractors, and some of that could 
turn into opposition," said Michael Miller, an aide to Assemblywoman Jackie 
Speier (D-San Mateo), chairwoman of the committee on consumer protection, 
governmental efficiency and economic development and author of two of the 
bills. 
</P>
<P>
 A summary of the legislation: 
</P>

 * A bill by Assemblyman Mickey Conroy (R-Orange) would require home 
improvement contractors to tell customers about license suspensions or 
revocations, complaints or legal judgments against them. Contractors who fail 
to do so would face fines. 
</P>
<P>
 * Assemblywoman Debra Bowen (D-Marina del Rey) proposed three bills that would 
eliminate waivers from the state contractor's license exam for people who have 
worked for a contractor for five years, require contractors who have had their 
licenses suspended or revoked to carry bonds greater than the $5,000 bond 
already required, and prohibit subcontractors from placing liens on homes when 
general contractors fail to pay them. 
</P>
<P>
 * A bill by Assemblywoman Diane Martinez (D-Rosemead) would tighten 
arbitration rules in contracting disputes. Arbitrators would be required to 
tape-record hearings in construction disputes and keep them for three years and 
provide written decisions based on those hearings. People employed in the 
construction industry could not serve as arbitrators. 
</P>
<P>
 * Speier proposes, among other things, to increase the size of the bond 
contractors must carry to $10,000 from $5,000 and to extend bonding coverage to 
"any home improvement contract" from "a homeowner's personal residence." A 
separate measure would extend the statute of limitations for the Contractors 
State License Board to investigate complaints about latent construction defects 
to 10 years, from the current three years.

 Brand watch: Procter & Gamble is slashing the price of its Joy dishwashing 
liquid in yet another concession to value-conscious consumers. 
</P>
<P>
 P&G said it is lowering the price of Joy by 12%, stripping it of its premium 
image to compete with cheaper "value-priced" brands. The price cut takes effect 
in mid-March. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the last year or so, P&G has steadily slashed prices on consumer goods to 
compete with lower-priced brands and store labels. Last April, it slashed 
prices on its Pampers and Luvs disposable diapers, remaking Luvs as a 
"value-priced" diaper. P&G has also eliminated some of its weaker brands, such 
as Top Job household cleaner. 
</P>
<P>
 Joy dishwashing liquid has been having a rough time. Sales in supermarkets 
fell 25% last year to $39.7 million, according to A.C. Nielsen, putting it far 
behind P&G's Dawn and Ivory, Colgate's Palmolive and Lever Bros.' Sunlight. 
Sales of dishwashing liquid overall fell 6.5%.

 Odds and ends: The gift that keeps you giving: To assist in record-keeping, 
MasterCard suggests people use credit cards when making charitable donations. 
But people who don't pay balances immediately will also be making interest 
payments to credit card issuers. . . . The color of money: First Consumers Bank 
of Oregon is introducing a credit card aimed at Irish Americans. It features 
the colors of the Irish flag.

THIS DOVE'S A HAWK IN THE SPOKEN-WORD AUDIO FIELD; MEDIA: BEVERLY HILLS FIRM 
REMAINS A STRONG INDEPENDENT IN AN INDUSTRY INCREASINGLY DOMINATED BY 
BEHEMOTHS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Ex-record producer Michael Viner never won a Grammy for his work on behalf of 
performers such as Sammy Davis Jr. But his luck improved when he changed 
professions. 
</P>
<P>
 Viner and his wife, actress Deborah Raffin, captured their second spoken-word 
Grammy this week as the heads of Dove Audio. The award for "Audrey Hepburn's 
Enchanted Tales" was the latest in a series of successes for Beverly 
Hills-based Dove, the largest independent producer of spoken-word tapes and 
compact discs in the country, with $22 million in retail sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry watchers say it's largely because of Dove's aggressive style that 
spoken-word audio has grown in this decade from a publishing sideshow known as 
books on tape to a mainstream media phenomenon that is expected to reach $1 
billion to $1.4 billion in sales this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Michael is an idea man like I've never known," said audio publisher Jessica 
Kaye, who founded Publishing Mills after working as Dove's vice president of 
business affairs. "He went out there and made a lot of noise about it while 
everyone else was clearing their throats." 
</P>
<P>
 Spoken-word recordings have existed for decades, but it wasn't until the 
mid-1980s that the market mushroomed. Major New York publishing houses such as 
Paramount's Simon & Schuster, Bertelsmann-owned Bantam Doubleday Dell, Advance 
Publications' Random House and News Corp.'s HarperCollins launched audio 
divisions, and independents such as Dove began to spring up. 
</P>
<P>
 National retail sales of spoken-word audio have grown exponentially since 
then, rising 37% in 1992 and 40.3% last year, according to the 
Connecticut-based Audio Publishers Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Dove, founded in 1988, has grown apace -- though some wonder how long the 
growth can continue as competition increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Dove is 63%-owned by Viner and Raffin, with the rest held by private 
investors, including their friend and international best-selling novelist 
Sidney Sheldon. Sales have risen an average 25% annually for the last few 
years, Viner said, adding that profit has averaged in the "mid- to high six 
figures." 
</P>
<P>
 Viner, who is also a film and television producer, and Raffin are known for 
bringing a sometimes bruising Hollywood approach to a fairly mannered industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Viner says he still uses lessons learned in the record industry. 
</P>
<P>
 "As with recording artists, we care more about the relationships with the 
readers (who narrate the books) and, of course, the writers," he said. "And we 
will promote much harder than anyone else in the business." 
</P>
<P>
 In one demonstration of that aggressiveness, Dove quickly snapped up the audio 
rights to Robert James Waller's "The Bridges of Madison County," which was 
published by Warner Books and was a potential hot property for Time Warner's 
8-month-old Audiobooks division. 
</P>
<P>
 The book, narrated by Waller, went on to become Dove's biggest seller, at 
about 190,000 copies to date. The digital two-cassette recording sells for 
about $17.95. The book, by comparison, has sold more than 4 million copies. 
</P>
<P>
 At $24.95, Stephen J. Hawking's four-cassette release of "A Brief History of 
Time" is the company's star earner, generating nearly $4.5 million in retail 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Viner says Time Warner tried to buy Dove when it re-entered the audio book 
business last June (after selling off a unit in the early 1980s). Time Warner 
declined to comment. While Viner said he is not interested in selling Dove now, 
some observers say companies like his will eventually have to sell out as 
multimedia behemoths such as Time Warner vie for a bigger share of the 
business. 
</P>
<P>
 One way Dove distinguishes itself is in its close ties to Hollywood 
celebrities. Meryl Streep and Dustin Hoffman are among those who have narrated 
books for the company. In one of its most ambitious projects, the company 
recently hired Gregory Peck to read the Bible. The 12-cassette edition is due 
out soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Dove added about 100 titles to its library of more than 800 fiction 
and nonfiction offerings. The list includes literary classics, children's 
books, compilations of National Public Radio shows, comedy, self-help and 
educational material, as well as more than 100 works in Spanish. 
</P>
<P>
 In spite of its rapid expansion, the industry is still young and relatively 
small. A widely predicted "explosion" has yet to occur. Observers say one key 
to growth is a movement into music and video stores. For that to happen, Viner 
said, books on tape will have to evolve into books on CD. 
</P>
<P>
 Dove was the first audio publisher to make its products widely available on 
compact disc. It distributes limited editions of its bestsellers -- Al Gore's 
"Earth in the Balance" and the 1994 Grammy-nominated "Mr. & Mrs. Bridge," read 
by Paul Newman and Joanne Woodward -- to Wherehouse Entertainment, Tower 
Records, Blockbuster Music and Musicland stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Some bookstore owners caution that because CDs themselves are such a young 
market, the venture is too risky for audio publishers. Viner concedes that CD 
sales remain slight. A bestseller on CD means 3,000 units, compared to 180,000 
or so for a best-selling cassette. "We hope to break even on CDs at the moment 
. . . but they are the future," he says.

TWO CONSUMER BILLS TARGET CONTRACTORS, BOND COMPANIES; CONSTRUCTION: MEASURES 
WOULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR HOMEOWNERS TO COLLECT DAMAGES FOR SHODDY WORK AND 
TIGHTEN REQUIREMENTS ON BUILDERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ERIC BAILEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Flooded with complaints about unscrupulous operators in the building trades, a 
state lawmaker has introduced two bills designed to protect homeowners from 
shoddy or illegal work by contractors and from problems with construction bond 
companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Jackie Speier (D-Burlingame) introduced the legislation in 
response to complaints by several disgruntled Orange County residents and 
dozens of others from across the state during hearings last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Those special sessions revealed myriad problems with the Contractors State 
License Board, which is responsible for disciplining the 275,000 builders it 
licenses in California, and prompted a series of administrative changes to 
improve consumer protections. 
</P>
<P>
 Speier's bills would broaden the reach of those reforms by making it easier 
for homeowners to collect damages for shoddy work and tightening requirements 
on contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 One measure would increase the likelihood that surety bond companies pay for 
contractor errors. Under current law, the bond firms can avoid paying claims 
for a contractor's failure to perform if it was not "deliberate" or "willful." 
Speier's bill would remove those conditions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The companies liberally apply that standard to a point where it's very 
difficult for legitimate claims to be collected upon," said Michael Miiller, a 
senior consultant with the Assembly's Consumer Protection Committee, which 
Speier chairs.  
</P>
<P>
 The bill would also increase the minimum bond amount to $10,000 from the 
current $7,500. In addition, it would require that surety bond companies pay 
claims if the Contractors State License Board finds a builder at fault. 
</P>
<P>
 Speier's second bill would hit unscrupulous builders on a variety of fronts. 
It would prohibit California's contractor board from approving licenses for 
builders suspended by another state. "We've seen a couple of cases where a 
contractor moved to California after committing offenses in Arizona or Oregon 
and then committed similar offenses here," Miiller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill also would require contractors to provide Social Security numbers and 
other identification on licenses so they could be tracked down more easily by 
wronged clients. In addition, it would extend the statute of limitations for 
the license board to investigate violations; the board would have 10 years 
instead of the current three years to look into defects. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, the bill would require that residential construction contracts 
disclose in writing that homeowners waive any right to a jury trial by 
accepting binding arbitration to resolve disputes with a builder. During the 
hearings last year, several homeowners complained that they were unaware of 
that legal reality. 
</P>
<P>
 Miiller said it remains unclear what kind of reception the bills will receive 
but said the Legislature and Gov. Pete Wilson have received "a ton of 
complaints" from residents unhappy over problems with contractors. 
</P>
<P>
 Dugald Gillies, a lobbyist representing a regional surety bond firm, said he 
has yet to consult with his client but guesses that Speier's legislation will 
not be warmly embraced. 
</P>
<P>
 Surety firms will likely be troubled by efforts to remove the requirement that 
construction bonds be paid only for willful or deliberate actions by a 
contractor, he said. Moreover, a requirement that bonds be paid if the license 
board rules against a contractor means the agency is "taking the place of a 
court," Gillies said. "Issues of due process have to be explored." 
</P>
<P>
 But the construction industry may be a bit more receptive. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bills are probably not going to be a problem at all," said Paul P. 
Gladfelty, a lobbyist for the Associated General Contractors of California. "We 
like to believe we represent a membership of the white hats, the guys who do a 
good job. To the extent this can clean up some of the bad actors, it certainly 
benefits the construction industry." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Contractors State License Board has yet to take a stand on 
Speier's bills, the agency's top executive predicted that the board will 
welcome them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe, in principle, the board would support these proposed changes," 
said Mickey Matsumoto, the agency's acting director. "I think the assemblywoman 
has identified some specific areas that can be strengthened to provide better 
protection."

ORANGE COUNTY NEWSMAKERS: FORMER STATE REGULATOR JOINS PLAZA HOME MORTGAGE BANK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEAN TAKAHASHI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 William D. Davis, a former state thrift industry regulator, has been appointed 
vice chairman of Plaza Home Mortgage Bank, FSB, the mortgage banking subsidiary 
of Plaza Home Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to serving in the newly created post, Davis also serves as a 
director on the boards of two other subsidiaries, Plaza Home Mortgage Bank, 
FSB, and Option One Mortgage Corp. 
</P>
<P>
 "Bill Davis has played an active role on three of Plaza's boards," said Jack 
French, Plaza chairman and chief executive. "He played an integral part in the 
start-up of our Option One Mortgage subsidiary." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, 57, said the appointment will enable him to be more active and keep the 
board better informed in monitoring the complicated business. But he added that 
he has no plans to become involved in day-to-day management. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been in this industry since 1962 and I've seen it evolve," he said. "I 
saw 65 thrifts close in my time as a regulator. The industry will continue to 
consolidate." 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza faces the challenge of continuing its growth as home refinancings have 
begun to cool as interest rates have risen. Under its Option One subsidiary, 
which Davis helped begin in January, 1993, Plaza has focused on making home 
loans in the "less than A mortgage rating" market -- to borrowers with less 
than top-notch credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Davis joined the Plaza Home Mortgage Bank board in October, 1992. Before that, 
he was chief operating officer of Guardian Savings in Huntington Beach, where 
he worked under his former boss, William J. Crawford. 
</P>
<P>
 Crawford was commissioner of the California Department of Savings and Loans 
from March, 1985, to May, 1991. During that stormy period of the thrift 
industry's worst financial crisis, Davis was deputy commissioner. After 
Crawford retired in 1990, Davis took over as commissioner for one year. 
</P>
<P>
 After Crawford became chairman of Guardian Savings, he brought aboard Davis in 
May, 1991. Their efforts to turn the thrift around were short-lived. Federal 
regulators seized the S&L in June, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair were quietly forced to resign in September of that year, shortly 
after Crawford tried to persuade regulators to allow him to turn the thrift 
into an employee-owned, minority-controlled operation. The Resolution Trust 
Corp. now operates Guardian. 
</P>
<P>
 Plaza Home Mortgage, with 35 offices in 13 states, is a mortgage banking 
company specializing in making home loans for one- to four-family residences. 
It is the ninth largest home mortgage lender in California and the 19th largest 
nationwide.

FLUOR CORP. PROFITS UP 23%, BETTERING ANALYSTS' FORECASTS; EARNINGS: 
COMBINATION OF COLD WINTER BOOST TO COAL SUBSIDIARY AND COMPLETION OF LUCRATIVE 
PROJECTS CITED.

<P>
 A cold winter and the completion of several unusually profitable projects 
contributed to 23% higher first-quarter earnings for Fluor Corp., the company 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor reported profits of $44 million, or 53 cents per share, for the quarter 
ended Jan. 31, compared with $36 million, or 43 cents per share, during the 
corresponding period a year earlier. Revenues rose 14 percent, from $1.8 
billion to $2.1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The earnings were 3 cents to 5 cents higher per share than analysts had 
predicted. 
</P>
<P>
 Shares of the international engineering, construction, maintenance and 
technical services company rose $2.75 in New York Stock Exchange trading 
Thursday, to close at $47.50. 
</P>
<P>
 Operating profits for Fluor Daniel, the company's core engineering and 
construction business, advanced nearly 20% over the same period a year ago 
because of an increase in work completed and higher profit margins, the company 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A.T. Massey, Fluor's low-sulfur coal subsidiary, delivered more than 20% 
higher operating profits, because of high demand for heat during the unusually 
bitter winter in the northern and eastern United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts warned that both the weather and the higher profit margins can change 
from quarter to quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was just a good mix of business completed during the quarter," said John 
N. Simon, a senior vice president with Seidler Cos., an investment bank in Los 
Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 Flour said separately that its chairman and chief executive officer, Les 
McCraw, has an excellent chance of full recovery after cancer surgery last 
week. McCraw had a low-grade prostate tumor removed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 In another announcement, the company said that a Chevron-Conoco joint venture 
had awarded it a $330-million contract to design and build an onshore 
processing plant for natural gas from the North Sea's Britannia field. 
</P>
<P>
 Fluor's quarterly results showed that new engineering and construction awards 
were $2.3 billion, up 14% compared with the first quarter of 1993. Its backlog 
of work was $14.8 billion compared with $14.9 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The company has repeatedly warned that its backlog might shrink, and the fact 
that it has held steady is a good sign, said Herbert E. Hart, an energy 
consultant with British brokerage S.G. Warburg & Co.'s San Francisco office.

STOCK DIPS AFTER PRESLEY POSTS $51-MILLION LOSS FOR 1993; FINANCES: THE NEWPORT

 Fiscally troubled Presley Cos. on Thursday reported a loss for 1993, and the 
news, though expected, pushed down the company's already depressed stock price. 
</P>
<P>
 The Newport Beach home builder reported an annual loss of $51 million, or 
$2.75 a share, which included a $33.3-million write-down related to its real 
estate holdings. That compared to a loss of $10.5 million, or 57 cents a share, 
for 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 In Thursday's trading on the New York Stock Exchange, Presley's stock dropped 
12 cents a share to close at $2.75. 
</P>
<P>
 The company had said in January that it would post an annual loss and was 
launching a major restructuring. 
</P>
<P>
 In a statement Thursday, Presley said plans for a debt-for-equity swap to 
restructure a $340-million credit line would reduce stockholders' equity by $79 
million, at least $9 million more than the amount estimated by the company in 
its Jan. 24 announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before, it was an estimated number. Now it's final. It's not that material a 
difference," said Craig Manchester, spokesman for Presley. "The majority of the 
shareholders are already aware of these changes." 
</P>
<P>
 If approved by Presley shareholders, the swap would convert $95 million of the 
debt into 43.16 million shares of common stock, equal to 70% of the outstanding 
shares. The swap would give Presley's lenders, mostly investors rather than 
banks, greater control. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, however, the company said there is still no signed letter of 
understanding with its lenders, and the restructuring is still being discussed. 
 
</P>
<P>
 Presley builds planned communities in California, Arizona and New Mexico. The 
company has become a victim of its own aggressive land acquisition policy in 
the late 1980s, when it purchased most of its properties with loans. The 
company bought vacant real estate at the top of the market and since then has 
seen land values plummet. 
</P>
<P>
 On a positive note, the company said Thursday that its home closings were up 
29% to 1,475 units during 1993 from 1,144 for the previous 12 months. Presley

 A $29-million loss in the fourth quarter, ending Dec. 31, contributed to 
Presley Cos.' fiscal year $51-million decline. The company attributed the 
quarterly loss to a $20.2-million write-down of its real estate assets, 
declining margins and changes in interest capitalization. Figures in millions

 On Top of It: Kaufman & Broad was the top-selling home builder in Orange 
County last year, capturing the majority of total new home sales, according to 
the Meyers Group, a real estate consulting firm in Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman & Broad accounted for 9.5% of all new home sales, quite a shift from 
1992 when the company ranked 11th in the county and only sold 2.42% of the 
county's total new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Reeb, president of the Meyers Group, said the largest builders in the 
county continued to dominate home sales, mostly because "the big builders are 
the ones who get the financing and can continue to build out existing projects 
and open up new ones." 
</P>
<P>
 The Fieldstone Co. captured the No. 2 spot again in 1993, recording 6.34% of 
Orange County's total home sales. The Irvine Co.'s home-building arm, Irvine 
Pacific, which ranked No. 1 in 1992, placed third in 1993. An Irvine Co. 
subsidiary, fourth place-ranked California Pacific Homes, formerly the Bren 
Co., had quite a year in 1993, selling 328 homes, contrasted with only 95 homes 
sold in 1992.

HOWARD ROSENBERG: NANCY, HOW COULD YOU? THE HALO COMES OFF; MEDIA: AFTER THE 
PRESS CREATED AN ICE ANGEL, KERRIGAN COULD NEVER LIVE UP TO EXPECTATIONS. NOW 
THEY'RE READY TO BURN HER AT THE STAKE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Nancy Kerrigan never said she was an angel. In fact, Kerrigan never said much 
of anything, aside from asking reporters to leave her alone and let her prepare 
for the Winter Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the bulk of the media that did the talking, relentlessly comparing the 
regal, graceful, balletic, endorsement-rich Kerrigan with her accused nemesis 
-- the shrill, inelegant Tonya Harding. It was classic good vs. evil, Snow 
White on blades vs. the surly ice witch, with many in the media typically 
ignoring the shadings and complexities of life by setting up Kerrigan as a 
genteel, wholesome heroine with milk running through her veins. 
</P>
<P>
 Inevitably, though, as the milk began to sour, the worms began to turn. 
</P>
<P>
 Typical this week was the following newspaper headline over an Associated 
Press story: "Kerrigan May Be Tarnishing Her Golden Image." The golden image 
polished by the media. 
</P>
<P>
 It's getting easier and easier to dislike Kerrigan. One reason is the constant 
exposure, the cover-girl publicity, the commercial after commercial. Her 
reported $2-million contract with Walt Disney Co. and the coming TV movies will 
only add to that exposure. Another reason, though, is that Kerrigan hasn't met 
our expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 The media's expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 It always seems to happen. We build them up, tall and shining, so that we can 
take them down -- do to them on the airwaves and in print what Kerrigan's 
assailant did to her with a steel baton. The media take it upon themselves to 
set impossible standards for someone; then, when those standards predictably 
aren't met, the backlash begins. 
</P>
<P>
 So, as Harding at least temporarily fades into the wings, Kerrigan is heard on 
television saying something snippy about Ukrainian gold medalist (and media 
icon-in-waiting) Oksana Baiul. So, while the media expect her to act with 
purity of heart, Kerrigan crassly chooses to attend a Disney World parade and 
float ride with Mickey Mouse over the Lillehammer closing ceremonies. So, in 
the presence of one of America's cartoon heroes, she's overheard applying 
"corny" and "dumb" either to the parade or, as she insists, to her mother's 
insistence that she wear her silver medal during the parade. The media's 
celebrity watchers will be debating that epic issue for the rest of 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as it was earlier deemed coarse and "unladylike" for Harding in January 
to publicly say she planned to "kick her (Kerrigan's) butt" on the ice, it's 
now deemed "unKerriganlike" for America's media-manufactured saint to display 
human flaws. She's imperfect. The gall of her. The nerve. For shame.  
</P>
<P>
 Yes, well, let's can it, all right? Let's stop this foolishness of 
automatically transforming star athletes into objects of worship. Kerrigan was 
the unfortunate victim of an attack. She recovered. Showing grit, she skated 
beautifully in Lillehammer, earning a silver medal. That means she's a tough, 
world-class performer on ice and a future multimillionaire, not Mother Teresa. 
The higher expectations are our mistake, not hers. 
</P>

 BLABBING FOR DOLLARS: After all the steamy hot blab about Roseanne Arnold and 
Mariel Hemingway smooching in a gay bar on a so-called controversial episode of 
ABC's "Roseanne" . . . 
</P>
<P>
 This was it? 
</P>
<P>
 I purposely waited to write about it until the episode had aired, not wanting 
to contribute to the hype. It was exactly that, wasn't it -- a shrewdly devised 
strategy to ensure that Tuesday's "Roseanne" retain its usual big audience 
(which it did) and clobber the Grammy Awards telecast on CBS? A stunt that ABC 
and executive producers Roseanne and Tom Arnold cooked up, knowing most of the 
media would not only buy it but also feast on it? 
</P>
<P>
 Given what was on the screen, what else could it have been but a publicity 
scam? 
</P>
<P>
 Surely no one at ABC, from the mail room to top management, was legitimately 
troubled by the physical contact on this episode. Why, lesbian-dating 
entrepreneur Howard Stern must have been laughing himself silly. You get as 
much kissing during the luge. 
</P>
<P>
 If you saw the episode, you get the drift. As someone who really enjoys 
watching lesbians kiss -- but is too cheap to subscribe to the Playboy Channel 
-- I was anxiously looking forward to this episode on free television. 
Heterosexual Roseanne Connor (Arnold) and her sister would accompany their 
lesbian friend, Nancy (Sandra Bernhard), and her girlfriend, Sharon 
(Hemingway), to a gay bar just for kicks. I'd heard about Sharon misreading 
Roseanne's playfulness and planting a wet one on her lips. This was going to be 
a big moment for me. I even made popcorn. 
</P>
<P>
 But no lip magic, no tongues? Just a puny five-second kiss that you couldn't 
even see because it was shot from behind Sharon's head? This was going to 
indoctrinate or confuse America's youth? This was going to turn America's 
little girls into junior lesbians and future guests on "Sally Jessy Raphael"? 
After months of Michael Jackson and Lorena Bobbitt, this is what ABC was so 
frantic about? 
</P>
<P>
 You just have to doubt it. 
</P>
<P>
 The parental advisory that ABC attached to Tuesday's "Roseanne" was probably 
part of the propaganda plan. If the network was so fearful that it felt a need 
to warn viewers, this had to be really hot, right? Not necessarily -- but it 
didn't detract from the program. Labeling, although inconsistently applied, 
makes a parent's task easier at 9 p.m. Some parents surely wouldn't have wanted 
their kids to watch this. 
</P>
<P>
 The kiss alone didn't make "Roseanne" worthwhile. It was merely a device, and 
not a gratuitous one. Much more arresting than this tepid display of physical 
affection was Roseanne's nervous reaction to it -- she was much more intrigued 
by the kiss than she wanted to admit -- and the incident's impact on her 
husband, Dan (John Goodman). It sexually aroused him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was very funny. But the point? Sexuality is complex, and even though many 
of both genders give lip service to being repulsed by homosexuality, their 
actual feelings may be more ambiguous. 
</P>
<P>
 No series on TV matches "Roseanne" when it comes to combining humor and depth. 
As it turned out, Tuesday's episode was rather extraordinary precisely because 
it wasn't exploitative. Its honesty, subtlety and sophistication were rare for 
television. Its hype was not.

STEVEN SEAGAL'S BOX-OFFICE SMASH SCORNED IN ALASKA; MOVIES: NATIVE AMERICANS 
AND OIL EXECUTIVES AGREE, 'ON DEADLY GROUND' GOT EVERYTHING DEAD WRONG. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANTHONY NEWMAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While the rest of the country has been stuck in an endless winter of frigid 
temperatures, record snowfalls, earthquakes and flooding, Alaska residents are 
enduring a disaster of a different sort: the latest from Steven Seagal. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Deadly Ground" is the movie that's offending just about everybody here. 
While that, in itself, may not be unusual for a Hollywood picture, what is 
interesting is that this film, which has been No. 1 and No. 2 the last two 
weekends at the box office, earns a spontaneous raspberry from Alaskans who 
often find themselves diametrically opposed to one another: massive oil 
corporations, Native cultures and headstrong environmentalists. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Warner Bros. release, Seagal plays Forrest Taft, a cigarillo-chomping 
maverick who apparently works as an oil-rig trouble-shooter. When Forrest 
learns that his boss is cutting ethical corners to build, in Alaska, "the 
biggest oil rig and refinery on the face of the planet," oil-company goons are 
dispatched to kill him. 
</P>
<P>
 Forrest thwarts their attempt and is rescued by a group of primitive Eskimos. 
A few disjointed spiritual discussions and visions unfold, followed by many 
explosions, fistfights and shootings, until Forrest finally punts his boss into 
a tub of crude. Then, in a bewildering coda, he travels to the Alaska State 
Capitol to lecture on alternative energy sources to a group who appears to 
include not only Alaska Natives but Africans and Norwegian sammis as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "On Deadly Ground," which Seagal also directed, was universally panned by 
critics (the New York Times called it "sludge"), but has nonetheless taken in 
$21.3 million so far at the box office. 
</P>
<P>
 What audiences are seeing, in the words of Anchorage columnist Mike Doogan, is 
a film that "gets absolutely everything wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 The oil industry has obvious reasons to dislike "On Deadly Ground." Michael 
Caine's corporate exec is as slippery as Prince William Sound, and will do 
anything -- lie, murder, swear a lot -- to maximize his profits. 
</P>
<P>
 Tom Gallagher, a spokesman for British Petroleum, decried the portrayal in the 
film. "Any conception of the oil industry as having no regard for the Natives, 
their beliefs, or the environment, and being only profit-motivated . . . is 
clearly a misconception," said Gallagher, who is assistant director of local 
government and community affairs for BP in Anchorage. Other oil company 
representatives declined to comment. 
</P>
<P>
 You might think the movie's drubbing of Big Oil would make the film a big hit 
among Alaska's environmental groups. But phone calls to the state's 
conservation groups revealed that hardly anyone had seen the film, perhaps, 
suggested one environmentalist, because conservationists tend to be pacifist 
types who don't approve of Seagal's brand of bone-splintering violence. Those 
who have seen the film have been turned off by its oversimplification. 
</P>
<P>
 Pam Miller, a staff biologist for Greenpeace, said she, for one, didn't like 
the film. "It was so simplified and hokey. In real life, the industry is much 
more subtle and slippery," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But Native Alaskans may be the most justified in their criticism. Apanguluk 
Charlie Kairaiuak, a Yup'ik Indian actor in Anchorage who was hired as a 
"cultural adviser" for the film, said, " 'On Deadly Ground' is loaded with 
inaccuracies and misrepresentations of Alaskan native culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The term Eskimo has fallen out of favor among indigenous Alaskans, who now 
prefer to be known as Inuits or, better yet, by their tribal names -- Yup'ik, 
for tribes from the Bering Seacoast, and Inupiat, for those living along the 
Arctic Coast, where the Natives that rescue Seagal in the movie supposedly 
live. 
</P>
<P>
 Kairaiuak was able to correct some details, such as when the filmmakers began 
building a village of igloo homes: Kairaiuak told them that if they insisted on 
building a primitive village (most Native Alaskans now live in modern homes and 
cabins), the homes should be constructed of sod, not snow and ice. 
</P>
<P>
 They listened to this suggestion, but ignored many others. What's left is a 
conglomeration of anthropology from the past and present, taken from indigenous 
cultures all over the Arctic and the Lower 48. The Natives -- most played by 
Japanese and Korean American actors -- wear furs and skins and carry spears, 
even though most inhabitants today wear coats of modern materials and hunt with 
high-powered rifles. The native village is set in the middle of Inupiat 
territory, but the actors are speaking the Yup'ik language. 
</P>
<P>
 The filmmakers also decorated their tribespeople with jewelry that belongs on 
Native Americans from the Great Plains, borrowed raven mythology from the 
Tligits of Southeast Alaska, and included generic Mother Earth spiritualism 
from who knows where. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Steven Seagal's native love interest, played by Chinese American 
Joan Chen, jumps on a horse. "You ride good?" Seagal's character asks. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course -- I'm a Native American," she says, galloping off. In fact, horses 
are rarely used for transportation in Alaska, and certainly not by North Slope 
Inupiats, Kairaiuak said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although he chuckles over some blunders, it's clear others aren't funny. 
Kairaiuak walked off the set when filmmakers insisted on setting up a prayer 
circle that he felt wasn't appropriate. One sequence, in which two Natives 
"throat chant" while nubile topless dancers sway to the music, is a combination 
of two native rituals that have nothing to do with each other. Moreover, 
"throat chanting was never done topless or naked. It was always done with 
clothes on," Kairaiuak said. 
</P>
<P>
 Outsiders may consider these minor issues, but to Kairaiuak and Diane Benson, 
a Tlingit Indian and casting agent who provided assistance with the film, these 
errors reinforce stereotypes that make indigenous Americans cringe. Both say 
the filmmakers led them to believe that much more of the focus of the picture 
-- which was originally titled "Rainbow Warrior" -- would be the Natives and 
their culture. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, "they put us in for 10 minutes so they can justify two hours of 
violence," Benson said. Native Alaskans whom she knows who appeared in or have 
seen the film have been "heartbroken" by it, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the ultimate irony revealed by the film is that it shows what a 
complicated place Alaska is. Although the movie's ads claim that Steven Seagal 
is here to "save the Alaska wilderness and protect its people," a number of 
residents consider the oil industry their real savior. They include many 
Natives, who benefit immensely when they sell the rights for development of oil 
and other natural resources on their land.

HICKS: LOSS OF AN UNCOMPROMISING ARTIST; APPRECIATION: THE TALENTED PERFORMER, 
WHO DIED SATURDAY, HAD FOUND MYRIAD OUTLETS IN RECENT MONTHS, INCLUDING TV, 
BOOK PUBLISHING, MAGAZINES AND CDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 When Calendar runs a piece acknowledging the passing of a significant artist 
or entertainer -- like comedian Bill Hicks, who died of pancreatic cancer 
Saturday at age 32 -- it's typically authored by a writer with particular 
expertise, not a member of that person's management team. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with my partner, Colleen McGarr, I managed Hicks for the better part of 
a year, but before going into management a half decade ago, I spent several 
years covering comedy for The Times and other publications. So I may be in a 
singular position to reflect on Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
 I had long felt Hicks was one of the two or three best comedians to take a 
stage in the last decade, an uncompromising artist of enormous intelligence, 
insight and command of language -- a provocateur with a razor-sharp point of 
view, shot through with irony, and one whose performances were consistently 
inspired and inspiring. 
</P>
<P>
 I became a bona fide fanatic years ago, seizing every opportunity to see any 
Hicks show I could. For those who were less fanatical, a Hicks show could be 
trying, and on any given night some percentage of the audience would walk out, 
outraged by what they heard. For many years -- he started doing stand-up at 15 
-- that was because portions of his act involved formulating explicit treatises 
that heartily embraced the sexual and the scatological. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Within the last year or so, as he further honed his vision, that element 
played a smaller and smaller role. This is hardly to suggest that he became a 
cuddly, user-friendly, dime-a-dozen comic trafficking in glib observations 
about airline travel and fast-food joints. Virtually any type of hypocrisy 
became target for a Hicksian smart bomb. While now only traces of his material 
were X-rated, his modus operandi was every bit as challenging to the audience 
as he tackled such topics as anti-abortion activists, Fundamental Christianity 
and the Waco siege.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, on any given night, the most common audience response was to beget a slew 
of new Hicks fanatics, from college students to their grandparents. 
Professional reviewers expressed considerable enthusiasm. Gerald Nachman, 
theater critic for the San Francisco Chronicle, wrote in a July review that 
"he's as original, caustic and challenging as were Lenny Bruce, Mort Sahl and 
Richard Pryor in their day." Critic John Lahr was only four sentences into a 
nine-page profile of Hicks in the Nov. 1 issue of the New Yorker before calling 
him "an exhilarating comic thinker in a renegade class all his own." 
</P>
<P>
 But these and plenty of similar superlatives didn't even hint at the breadth 
of Hicks' talent, which finally had found myriad outlets in recent months. He 
had created "The Counts of the Netherworld," a show for England's Channel 4 
that he would write and star in, and that surely would have been viewed as a 
pioneering piece of television programming. A fistful of publishing houses were 
courting him. He had been asked to start contributing columns to the Nation. He 
had written a few screenplays, was in the midst of a provocative new script and 
already had the ideas together for the next one. He was a gifted 
guitarist-songwriter, and while he had released two conventional comedy CDs, he 
had recently recorded two more, but these featured the innovation of a musical 
score that he composed and played. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And while it shook him deeply last October to have his 12th "Letterman" 
appearance entirely censored, it almost seemed to redouble his interest in 
exploring alternative ways to present his primary art: There were discussions 
with John Magnuson, who directed the Lenny Bruce concert film -- and who, upon 
seeing his first Hicks show in July had become a fanatic -- about doing a 
similar movie with Hicks. 
</P>
<P>
 As these things were coming together, his dream became to buy a house where he 
could hole up and write the book, screenplay and columns, compose and play 
music, work on his records and get a dog named Lester. As dreams go, it was a 
relatively simple one, and Colleen and I desperately wanted to make it come 
true, especially when it appeared he was making a medically unprecedented 
triumph over the cancer. 
</P>
<P>
 People liked to be around Hicks, to do things for him. I was drawn to him just 
as much personally as professionally. For as extraordinary and inspirational as 
Bill Hicks was as an artist, he was equally so as a human being: uncommonly 
bright, intuitive, perceptive, emotionally direct, charming, amazingly 
well-read, insightful and capable of tremendous warmth and love once he trusted 
you. If he liked and trusted you, and you had an endearing quirk or two, so 
much the better. 
</P>
<P>
 It turned out that over the months we worked together, he had noticed -- I 
hadn't -- that when he delivered some weird or wild news, I had a tendency to 
respond by saying, "Oh my God," in something resembling a Valley Girl 
inflection. Once he pointed out this tendency, I naturally became quite 
self-conscious and tried to resist saying the phrase, while he subtly tried to 
bait me into saying it. One of the last times we spoke, he called rather 
discouraged about something career-related. And when he told me, I was shocked, 
and I did say it. He instantly perked up, gleefully noting, "I got an 'Oh my 
God' out of you!" It made him so happy. 
</P>
<P>
 I'd give anything for him to still be able to bait me that way. There were so 
many things he didn't have the opportunity to do. He didn't even have a chance 
to get the dog. 
</P>
<P>
 I'm pretty sure Lester would have thought Bill Hicks was amazing and would 
have loved him intensely. I know we all did.

A PINCH HITTER STEPS UP TO THE PLATE AT OPERA PACIFIC; OPERA: JANE EAGLEN WILL 
SING BRUNNHILDE ROLE IN 'DIE WALKURE,' WHICH OPENS TODAY IN COSTA MESA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS PASLES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In 1949, Maria Callas made the history books by singing Elvira in Bellini's "I 
Puritani" only three days after she sang Brunnhilde in Wagner's "Die Walkure." 
That kind of vocal versatility -- shifting from Wagnerian breadth and weight to 
bel-canto high extension and coloratura -- hadn't been heard since Lilli 
Lehmann in the 1890s. 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Eaglen had a little more time. She got about two weeks between singing 
Bellini's Norma for the Seattle Opera and coming to Costa Mesa to sing 
Brunnhilde for Opera Pacific, starting today. 
</P>
<P>
 Callas had been substituting for an ailing colleague when she took over the 
role of Elvira. Eaglen was brought in at the last minute for both roles -- 
replacing Carol Vaness, who withdrew from "Norma" because of a back ailment, 
and Ealynn Voss, who withdrew from "Walkure" for personal reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess it's a big deal, but I don't really think about it," the former 
member of the English National Opera said over lunch at her hotel here. "I just 
sing the things that seem right at the time and which seem to be right for my 
voice. I think I sing Brunnhilde and Norma very differently without consciously 
thinking, 'Oh, this is such and such, I must sing it like this.' By responding 
to the style and the nature of the music, it just kind of happens." 
</P>
<P>
 She sang her first Brunnhilde with John Mauceri and the Scottish Opera in 1991 
(Mauceri will conduct the Opera Pacific dates) following a 10-week rehearsal 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Valkyries were on stilts, so they had to have the 10 weeks. It looked 
fairly impressive, I must say. . . . But it was hard not to want to kill people 
by the end of 10 weeks. It was just too long." 
</P>
<P>
 There won't be any stilts in Costa Mesa but, in another departure, the whole 
opera will be done behind a scrim. 
</P>
<P>
 "They say it looks very beautiful," Eaglen said doubtfully. "Sometimes, it can 
give a kind of mystical sort of quality to it. From a performer's point of 
view, however, you always feel that you're cut off somehow." 
</P>
<P>
 She envisions Brunnhilde as "about 15 years old. I like to try to portray her 
as a young girl who has a lot of growing up to do before the end (of 'Der Ring 
des Nibelungen'). You have to think that the character actually progresses much 
more than just in this opera -- though in this opera she really has to be seen 
to have a long way to go. She has to grow up considerably by the end." 
</P>
<P>
 This point of view, she said, has led to some friction with stage director 
Roberto Oswald. "I have to be careful here. . . . He and I haven't really got 
on. I think he had a problem with me from the start because he thought I was 
very young. I'm 33. Feb. 15 marks my 10th anniversary as a professional singer. 
In that time I think I've done something like 28 roles. I said to him, 'I think 
you think I'm very young and inexperienced. I'm actually neither.' But for me 
to say to him, this is what I think about her. . . . He's actually not 
interested in listening." 
</P>
<P>
 But she doesn't expect that "the production will be affected in the end" 
because "everyone is very good at his or her role and everyone's very 
professional and gets on with it and does the job." 
</P>
<P>
 Eaglen was born in England to a family which, she said, "had nothing to do 
with music." She began studying voice at the University of Manchester with 
Joseph Ward, who has remained her sole teacher. Even then, Ward predicted that 
someday the soprano would sing Brunnhilde and Norma. 
</P>
<P>
 Her role models included Birgit Nilsson and Callas. "I think Nilsson is just 
the greatest voice, ever. And I think that basically Maria Callas was way up 
here and then opera singers are about down here. For the drama of it, Callas 
would be first every time. 
</P>
<P>
 "But it can be dangerous to listen to too many records," she added. "You just 
end up, without even consciously meaning to, doing an impression of them. I 
just prefer getting it from the score, really." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Callas, who eventually dropped the heavier repertory, Eaglen wants to 
continue singing it and the bel-canto heroines. "I think in probably 10 years 
time, I'll be quite happy to sing Isolde, Brunnhilde, Turandot -- and Norma. I 
hope I'll always keep that in there to keep the flexibility in the voice for as 
long as possible." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Isolde as a stage role has eluded her, although she did sing Isolde's 
Liebestod under Mauceri in July at the Hollywood Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm desperate to sing Isolde now," she said. "That's on the horizon." 
</P>
<P>
 * Eaglen will sing Brunnhilde in Wagner's "Die Walkure" for Opera Pacific at 
the Orange County Performing Arts Center, 600 Town Center Drive, Costa Mesa, 
Friday and March 10, 12 and 18 at 7 p.m. and March 20 at 2 p.m. $15 to $75.

KCBS' LATE-NIGHT NEWS GETS A PUSH FROM OLYMPICS; TELEVISION: GAMES PROPEL 11 
P.M. SHOW TO A RATINGS VICTORY BUT THE STATION BADLY TRAILED ABC AND NBC IN 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY-MORNING VIEWING DURING SWEEPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Winter Olympics on CBS helped propel KCBS-TV Channel 2's 11 p.m. news to 
its first victory in a ratings "sweeps" period in at least 10 years, but the 
whopping audience interest in the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan saga and other 
Olympic happenings did not rub off on the station's other news programs. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, KCBS again badly trailed its two network-owned rivals in the 
afternoon and early-morning news periods with numbers that, despite the Olympic 
fever, were lower than for the same period last year, according to data for the 
February sweeps released Thursday by the A.C. Nielsen Co. 
</P>
<P>
 KABC-TV Channel 7 continued to lead all Los Angeles-market rivals in news at 
4, 5 and 6 p.m., and it even beat the longtime early-morning news champ, 
KNBC-TV Channel 4, at 6 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 KABC, however, finished third at 11 p.m., and its news numbers in most time 
periods, though comparable to those posted during last November's sweeps, were 
down slightly from those of February, 1993, when stormy local weather, the 
bombing of the World Trade Center and the Branch Davidian stand-off in Waco, 
Tex., inflated news ratings at all stations. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC finished second behind KABC in most news time periods, but the station 
closed the huge gap of a year ago as its 5 p.m., 6 p.m. and 11 p.m. newscasts 
grew by about 10%. 
</P>
<P>
 February is one of four ratings periods each year that help stations determine 
advertising rates. But local television executives caution that while these 
totals are important for bragging rights, most ad buys are made to target 
specific demographic groups and not simply to reach the most households. 
</P>
<P>
 KABC continued to benefit from the huge advantage provided by "The Oprah 
Winfrey Show" at 3 p.m., which more than doubles the audience of any of its 
competitors, including KNBC's "Sally Jessy Raphael." Channel 7 won the 4 p.m. 
news battle over KNBC by a margin of more than 135,000 households.  
</P>
<P>
 At 5 p.m., however, KNBC's audience picked up, closing Channel 7's lead to 
just over 55,000 homes -- last year KABC lead by almost three times that much 
-- with KCBS another 125,000 homes behind. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 p.m., Channel 7 led KNBC by about 75,000 homes and KCBS by about 140,000 
households. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Among the networks, CBS easily won the February sweeps in prime time, grabbing 
an average 35% of the available audience, compared to 17% for ABC, 16% for NBC 
and 11% for Fox. During its 16-day coverage of the Olympics, CBS averaged an 
incredible 42% share of the prime-time audience, which increased the network's 
audience for the month some 48% over totals last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Thanks to CBS' Olympics bonanza, KCBS' 11 p.m. news audience leaped 60% over a 
year ago, winning the time period with an average of 500,000 households each 
night. KNBC was second with about 360,000 homes and KABC was third with 330,000 
homes.  
</P>
<P>
 During the two weeks without the Olympics, however, the standings reverted to 
form as KCBS lost 40% of its audience to fall into third. KABC was first. 
</P>
<P>
 Among independents, KTLA-TV Channel 5 continued to shine. Its morning news 
easily beat the three network morning shows from 7 to 9 a.m., and it more than 
quadrupled the audience of KTTV-TV Channel 11's upstart local program. And at 
10 p.m., Channel 5 hung on to its longtime lead in news with an average of 
about 265,000 homes each night. KTTV was second with about 200,000, KCAL-TV 
Channel 9 was third with about 130,000 and KCOP-TV Channel 13 was fourth with 
an average of 105,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest winner during last month's ratings period was KTTV's 
children's show, "The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers," which improved the 
station's numbers about 45% over its programming in the 5 p.m. time period last 
year. "The Power Rangers," which has become a national phenomenon in the 
tradition of the Ninja Turtles and He-Man, won the 5 p.m. time period over all 
local newscasts -- the first time in years that a non-news program has taken 
that honor. 
</P>
<P>
 In what seemed like the greatest month in tabloid TV history, KABC's old 
reliables, "Jeopardy" and "Wheel of Fortune," nonetheless captured the 
important 7- to 8-p.m. hour. 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC's "Entertainment Tonight" was second behind "Jeopardy" at 7 p.m., 
followed by KCBS' "Real Stories of the Highway Patrol" which scored almost 
twice the audience the station drew last year with Bill Cosby's "You Bet Your 
Life." KCAL's "Inside Edition," which reportedly paid more than $500,000 for 
the interviews with Harding it aired last month, ended up in last place in the 
time period, losing 33% of its audience from a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
 At 7:30 p.m., KNBC's "Hard Copy," which sent co-anchor Terry Murphy to Norway 
to cover the Harding-Kerrigan soap opera, finished a strong second to "Wheel of 
Fortune," but KTTV's "A Current Affair," which focused heavily on the criminal 
investigation of Harding and scored paid-for interviews with her ex-husband, 
Jeff Gillooly, lost audience from a year ago and finished sixth in the time 
period. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Late Show With David Letterman" on KCBS also benefited from the Olympics, 
winning the late-night battle with 21% of the audience, compared to 14% for 
both "Nightline" and "The Tonight Show" and 8% for "The Arsenio Hall Show."  
</P>
<P>
 Also thriving last month was KCOP's "The Ricki Lake Show," which, despite the 
heavy competition from "The Power Rangers" at 5 p.m., was the highest-rated 
daytime talk show other than "Oprah." Lake averaged 255,000 homes each 
afternoon, while Winfrey drew nearly 450,000. 
</P>
<P>
 KMEX-TV Channel 34 captured 65% of those watching the three area 
Spanish-language stations between 9 a.m. and midnight daily. KVEA-TV Channel 52 
attracted 20% and KWHY-TV Channel 22 received 15% of that audience. KMEX also 
dominated in local news, pulling in about 150,000 households at 6 p.m. compared 
to KVEA's 60,000, and another 85,000 at 11 p.m. to KVEA's 45,000. KWHY does not 
broadcast news. 
</P>
<P>
 Surprisingly, the big audience for the Winter Olympics did not make Channel 2 
the most-watched station around the clock last month. That gold medal went to 
Channel 7 with a 7 rating (where each point represents about 50,000 homes) for 
each 24-hour period. KCBS was second with a 5.6, followed by KNBC's 5.2, KTTV's 
4.3, KTLA's 3.8, KCOP's 3.3 and KCAL's 2.5.

IS O.C. READY TO SUPPORT MORE FOLK? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The pickings in Orange County are usually slim for fans of traditional folk 
music, but two upcoming concerts could indicate whether the market is ready for 
a bigger menu of folk offerings. 
</P>
<P>
 With help from Shade Tree Stringed Instruments, the little guitar shop that 
has been the county's steadiest venue for traditional folk concerts, the Coach 
House in San Juan Capistrano is presenting its first-ever bluegrass show, an 
April 11 performance by celebrated banjo player Ralph Stanley and his band, the 
Clinch Mountain Boys. 
</P>
<P>
 On a smaller scale, Kenneth Zwick, a Costa Mesa lawyer and guitarist, will 
launch what he hopes will become a monthly series of concerts with shows 
Thursday and March 11 by the English-Irish duo of Steve Tilston and Maggie 
Boyle -- the first at the Rose & Crown British Pub & Restaurant in San 
Clemente, and the second at the Rose & Crown's second location in Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 The Shade Tree, in Laguna Niguel, was the host of two sold-out shows by 
Stanley in February, 1992. The bluegrass pioneer wanted a return engagement on 
his current tour, but Shade Tree owners Greg and Margie Mirken decided that 
Stanley was too big an act for them to handle again in a mom-and-pop shop that 
seats no more than 60 people for concerts. 
</P>
<P>
 Not wanting to deprive Orange County fans of a chance to see Stanley, the 
Mirkens approached Coach House owner Gary Folgner about booking him. Folgner 
agreed to take a gamble on bluegrass. Margie Mirken said that the Coach House, 
which seats about 500 people, is assuming all the financial risk for the show, 
but will rely on Shade Tree to promote it via its own 3,000-name mailing list. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without the Shade Tree, we're not doing this show," said Ken Phebus, the 
Coach House concert director. "I'm glad to see this happening. Hopefully, with 
(the Mirkens') help, we can develop something here." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Phebus said it helped that Stanley came highly touted to the Coach House by 
Dwight Yoakam, the country star who has played several times at Folgner's club. 
"Gary and Dwight have talked about this act, and Dwight raves about him." 
</P>
<P>
 Yoakam raved to the whole nation about Stanley during last Tuesday's Grammy 
Awards telecast. "Miner's Prayer," a Yoakam-Stanley duet from Stanley's album 
"Saturday Night (& Sunday Morning)," was nominated for a Grammy as Best Country 
Vocal Collaboration. Adam Duritz, singer of the hot young rock band Counting 
Crows, also gives Stanley's album a plug in the current issue of Rolling Stone. 
</P>
<P>
 Stanley, a 67-year-old Virginian, began performing professionally in 1946 with 
his brother, Carter (who died in 1966), and has since presided over bands that 
included future country stars Ricky Skaggs and Keith Whitley. 
</P>
<P>
 Mirken, who ranks Stanley second in importance in bluegrass history only to 
Bill Monroe, sees the Coach House show as a test of local fans' willingness to 
support bluegrass music. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a crapshoot. It's 50-50 whether (Folgner) will get enough people to 
make it worth his while," she said. "If this works, we're in the pipeline" to 
do Coach House shows by other major bluegrass acts, such as Alison Krauss & 
Union Station and the Nashville Bluegrass Band. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Zwick's plunge into folk-concert promotion began by accident when he attempted 
to track down a hard-to-find album by Tilston through the mail and wound up 
getting a transatlantic call from the artist himself. 
</P>
<P>
 When he learned that Tilston and Boyle, a husband-and-wife duo who record for 
Green Linnet Records, had not been able to find a Southern California booking 
for their upcoming American tour, Zwick took matters into his own hands. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their own albums, Tilston and Boyle have recorded with 
Brit-folk veterans John Renbourn and Bert Jansch, and Boyle's singing can be 
heard under the opening and closing credits on the "Patriot Games" movie 
soundtrack. 
</P>
<P>
 Zwick first approached the Shade Tree, which, along with the Living Tradition 
series in Anaheim, has been the county's main stage for touring traditional 
folk talent. The Mirkens were fully booked but suggested that Zwick try 
promoting a show himself. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been complaining a long time to my friends about having to go to 
McCabe's (in Santa Monica) or go up to Riverside" for folk music, said Zwick, 
who plays in the acoustic band Evening Muse and has a local practice in 
entertainment law. "So I was saying to myself, 'What the heck, why don't I see 
what I can do about putting on something here?' " 
</P>
<P>
 Zwick turned to friends who own the Rose & Crown pubs, which each can seat 
concert audiences of about 100 people. He hopes the Tilston & Boyle shows will 
prove to be the kickoff for a monthly series. While Zwick mentions such Shade 
Tree veterans as Dan Crary, Laurence Juber and Martin & Jessica Simpson as acts 
he would like to book, he has no intention of competing with the 
better-established folk venue. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may put on some of the same people (as the Shade Tree) but not at the same 
time, so there's at least a few months' break" between their Orange County 
appearances. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's not a lot of money to be made in this whole thing," Zwick continued. 
"It's for the love of the music, and in my case, making some connections with 
people who might want to use me in my other capacity (as a lawyer)." 
</P>
<P>
 Any increase in local outlets for folk music is fine with Margie Mirken -- 
whether through small gatherings run by Zwick or big-name bills booked by the 
Coach House. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of a sudden (traditional folk) could be a cool thing, and you could get 
out of that incestuous world of (drawing) people who only go to folk concerts," 
she said. "The more you have, the better it is." 
</P>
<P>

Coach House, 33157 Camino Capistrano, San Juan Capistrano. $15. (714) 496-8930.

STORE HAS SAFETY FOR SALE; GLENDALE GALLERIA'S NEW DISASTER PREPAREDNESS SHOP 
OFFERS EVERYTHING TO SURVIVE QUAKES AND OTHER NASTY EVENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 If you're looking for sturdy Velcro strips to keep your artwork from flying 
around during an earthquake or a special putty that holds china in place during 
the shaker, a trip to the Glendale Galleria might be in order.  
</P>
<P>
 Located on the mall's lower level, the shopping center's newest store has all 
that and other equipment to help survive a big temblor -- or other natural 
catastrophes, for that matter. 
</P>
<P>
 It's hard to miss the Disaster Preparedness store. A yellow caution road sign 
that says "Be Ready Store" sits next to a large white banner with red letters 
that reads "Disaster Preparedness." 
</P>
<P>
 A window display has "Earthquake" in large orange letters and everything from 
a fire escape ladder to large blue barrels of drinking water, propane fuel and 
emergency first aid kits. 
</P>
<P>
 The walls of the relatively small, 1,500-square-foot interior are hung with 
large fluorescent banners labeled for practically every disaster -- flood, 
hurricane, tidal waves, nuclear war and, of course, earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 This place is a definite attention-grabber in these times of frazzled nerves. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know about this store, but when I came in from the parking lot, it 
was the first thing I saw, so I came in," said Rodney Pick, who recently moved 
to Burbank because his Santa Clarita house was severely damaged in the Jan. 17 
quake. "It's the greatest thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Pick bought two home security lights -- for $19.95 each -- that plug into 
outlets and go on automatically in a power outage. They're very popular these 
days -- 500 were sold in one week, store owner Al Cabacungan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Many of the store's other items are also in demand. The two-person, three-day 
survival kits -- at $49.95 each -- are moving at the rate of about 40 a day, 
said Janie O'Neill, the store manager. The kits include 12 water packets, two 
food bars, two ponchos, two light sticks and a flashlight, radio and first aid 
supplies. 
</P>
<P>
 Other big sellers are two-story ladders ($79.95 apiece), all kinds of water 
containers and first aid kits. Oh, and let's not forget Quake Grip. Every two 
inches of the Velcro strip holds about 40 pounds. A pack of four 2-by-2-inch 
strips sells for $11. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're completely sold out of that," Cabacungan said. "A lot of people had 
stuff damaged because it flew around, so they want to secure it and that's the 
stuff to use." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've had people come in here and throw their credit card on the counter and 
say, 'I wasn't prepared. What do I need to get to be prepared?' Everyone has a 
story to tell," said Cabacungan, who, with his business partner Adolf Singh, 
opened the Glendale store two weeks ago after receiving a call from a woman in 
charge of leasing the mall's outlets. Cabacungan and Singh had met her at the 
small Oceanside mini-mall where they had opened a disaster-preparedness store 
three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were looking for preparedness items for our own families, and we had to go 
to about 15 different stores to get all the stuff we needed," said Singh, who 
is Cabacungan's brother-in-law. "So we thought it would be great to have just 
one place where the average person could pick stuff up." 
</P>
<P>
 Many places sell some of the items found in the Disaster Preparedness store 
and the Yellow Pages list several mail-order companies with the same 
merchandise. But so far, this is the only shop with a retail outlet in the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 In about 48 hours, Cabacungan, Singh and several friends set up the Glendale 
store, which they plan to keep open until at least April 1. 
</P>
<P>
 "We came in on Wednesday to an empty place and people insisted on getting in 
while we tried to put the store together," O'Neill said. "It's unbelievably 
incredible the amount of people we've had every day." 
</P>
<P>
 She said an average of 700 people go through the store daily and twice that 
amount come on Saturday and Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 A mall information officer said he fields about 20 calls a day inquiring about 
the earthquake store. 
</P>
<P>
 "And it's always busy," said the officer, who asked that his name not be used. 
"It's the busiest store in the mall right now. Everyone is in there." 
</P>
<P>
 Cabacungan, who is staying with a relative in Torrance while running the 
Glendale operation, said sales in Oceanside are consistently good but not as 
high as here. About four times as much merchandise was sold during the first 
week in Glendale than an average week in Oceanside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our place out there is about 500 feet bigger, but the traffic is 20 times 
less," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 There's nothing like a natural disaster for business. So do these 
entrepreneurs sit around hoping that another big earthquake hits? 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course not," Cabacungan said. "People joke all the time and say, 'Hey, do 
you guys pray for a disaster?' Well, ha-ha, it's a joke, but hey, we're going 
to be the life of the party. Literally." WHERE TO SHOP 
</P>
<P>
 What: Disaster Preparedness store. 
</P>
<P>
 Location: Store 2245, next to Mervyn's on the lower level of Glendale 
Galleria, between Central Avenue and Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 Hours: 10 a.m. to 9 p.m. Mondays through Saturdays, 10 a.m. to 7 p.m. Sundays.

VALLEY VOGUE / CINDY LAFAVRE YORKS; TRACKING TRENDS FOR STYLE MAVENS; THE WEST 
COAST PIPELINE, A PRICEY NEW 'ZINE, HELPS THE FASHION AND BEAUTY INDUSTRIES 
STAY ABREAST OF HOW TO LOOK AND WHERE TO BE SEEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CINDY LaFAVRE YORKS, Cindy LaFavre Yorks covers fashion regularly for The 
Times. 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Attention hipsters: The latest in street fashion, sports, nightclubs, music 
and interior design are yours for the perusing inside West Coast Pipeline, a 
Woodland Hills-based trend 'zine. 
</P>
<P>
 Information is compiled by a handful of reporters who cover the cutting-edge 
scenes "from the Bay to the border." Because of the ad-free journalism and 
$100-a-year price, the magazine is geared primarily to buyers, manufacturers 
and retailers in the fashion and beauty industries. The first couple of issues 
look promising. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the haute spots in the San Fernando Valley mentioned in recent issues: 
Ground Zero, a Burbank coffeehouse (and groovy hangout for 'zine staffers), and 
Spazz, a Reseda newsstand. While publisher Caroline Lettieri says she travels 
over the hill in search of information, she finds plenty to write about in the 
Valley. From Burbank's funky resale areas to teen-packed Sherman Oaks Galleria, 
she and staffers track the trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "Melrose is groovy, but I get much more inspiration looking around the malls 
here," said Lettieri, who believes that Woodland Hills is mounting a cultural 
renaissance. She is finding that a lot of young designers of surfing and 
snowboarding fashions are moving here to start out. In spite of the Jan. 17 
earthquake, Lettieri is optimistic about the Valley's continuing role as an au 
courant spot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm still very much in love with the Valley, and nothing's going to change 
that," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 OH MY, THIGHS: Who would have thought that the dreaded thigh would rise like a 
phoenix to become the season's fashion focal point? Unbelievably, that is 
exactly what is happening. Thigh highs, also known as over-the-knee stockings, 
are pulled up just above the kneecap and made to slouch a bit to show off the 
thigh. Natch, only the truly toned need apply. 
</P>
<P>
 Designers such as Ralph Lauren, Betsey Johnson and Gianni Versace are not only 
showing thigh-high styles with their spring fashions, they are selling them in 
their signature boutiques. Closer to home in the Valley, pairs of thigh-high 
hose are "walking" out of Albert's Hosiery in Media City Center in Burbank, 
says manager Joyce Abdulaziz. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not just teen-agers who are buying them, but younger women in their 20s 
too," she said. Opaque thigh highs, the most popular of the new leg looks, are 
made to stay up by themselves. Sheer styles, available in a variety of colors, 
may be worn with garter belts for a racier evening look. Most are solids, but 
maverick designers like Johnson prefer a kind of Raggedy Ann-inspired striped 
thigh high, with vertical and even horizontal striped styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Textured and solid opaque styles in black are offered this spring by Hot Sox, 
a New York-based manufacturer whose leg wear is sold at Bullock's and 
Nordstrom. The basic shade, says the company's marketing director, Gayle 
Goodman, is an ideal complement to the season's neutral-colored jumpers, hot 
pant-style shorts and the short skirts making a comeback. 
</P>
<P>
 CHILLING NEWS: The spring beauty forecast is calling for a frost. Fortunately, 
the metallic glitz isn't as blinding as the chilling wave that blew through the 
'60s and '70s, says Mary Jo Price, owner of Mary Jo's Beauty Boutique in 
Sherman Oaks. Price, who carries a variety of cosmetics from Clarins to Cover 
Girl, says shimmer is the accepted term for frost in the '90s. She welcomes the 
newer, subtler frosts in blush, lipstick, eye shadows and nail polishes over 
the preceding makeup trends. 
</P>
<P>
 "The darker, extreme colors popular in recent years are so difficult to wear, 
they really didn't translate well to the street," Price said. "These new looks 
are much more wearable, and not just for the younger girls but older women, 
too." Shades that are light years away from the darker hues: OPI Nail Lacquer 
in Pompei purple for the hands and Cover Girl goldspun mauve for the lips. 
</P>
<P>
 Women who want a little shimmer on their faces might try Sebastian's Naked 
Gilt, an opalescent gel designed to add a bit of shimmer to cheekbones or all 
over the face, even cleavage. Another alternative is Fuse, a cream designed to 
add a touch of shimmer to lips or under the brow. Both Gilt and Fuse are 
available at Sebastian Salons, where Trucco Cosmetics are carried, as well as 
at Profumeria, the company's store in its Woodland Hills compound.

ROBERTI ATTACKS RECALL DRIVE'S RAFFLE OF GUNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN SCHWADA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A raffle -- featuring firearms as prizes -- to help finance the campaign to 
recall state Sen. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) was attacked Thursday by the 
embattled senator as fresh evidence that his foes are gun zealots. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, the legality of the raffle -- or "donation drawing," as 
supporters have termed it -- is being questioned by Roberti, who faces an April 
12 recall election. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter, Roberti has asked Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti to determine if the 
fund-raising effort, sponsored by Californians Against Corruption, a Signal 
Hill-based group, complies with state laws regulating raffles and the transfer 
of firearms between parties. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, the raffle created a new public relations problem for recall 
organizers as they try to portray themselves as good government reformers and 
not, as Roberti has contended, gun fanatics seeking retribution because the 
senator authored a 1989 assault-weapons ban.  
</P>
<P>
 "The problem is that the anti-tax and victims rights groups are part of the 
recall movement, but they don't give money," said recall leader Russ Howard. 
"These guys (in the Second Amendment rights groups) will mortgage their houses 
to get Roberti. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that if you want to oust David Roberti you're insane not to hit 
up the Second Amendment rights people," Howard said. "And if you do, you have 
to offer them something they like (as prizes)." 
</P>
<P>
 Recall leaders acknowledge that opposition to Roberti's gun control position 
motivates many of their supporters but say that others are equally angry at 
Roberti as a soft-on-crime, big government liberal who has ruled the state 
Senate during a period of unprecedented corruption and does not even live in 
the district. 
</P>
<P>
 The recall appeared to gain a new level of legitimacy when it was endorsed 
unanimously last weekend by delegates to the state Republican Party convention. 
That boost came after a setback suffered when it was reported that 15 weapons 
had been stolen from the home of recall movement leader William Dominguez. 
</P>
<P>
 But news of the raffle has put recall leaders on the defensive again. "Yeah, 
it came at a bad time," said Howard, a Palos Verdes Estates financial 
consultant. "We should have seen this coming." 
</P>
<P>
 A flyer advertising the raffle has gone to several thousand CAC supporters in 
the past 10 days and fell into the hands of Roberti, who released it to the 
media. 
</P>
<P>
 Howard said he had no firm estimate of how much money the raffle has raised so 
far. "It could be as much as $10,000," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 The drawing for the winning tickets is to be held March 15. "You can help dump 
Senator David Roberti and have fun winning while he loses!" the flyer states. 
</P>
<P>
 The total value of the prizes -- all donated -- runs about $4,000, Howard 
said. Donors include firearm manufacturers such as Calico, a Bakersfield-based 
gun maker; Turner's Outdoorsman, a sporting goods chain; and a central 
California outfitter who donated a one-day wild pig hunting excursion. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the top prizes is a Calico M951 Carbine, a legal semiautomatic assault 
rifle. The Calico M950, a virtual twin of the M951, was one of the weapons 
singled out under the ban that Roberti helped write. However, the outlawed 
weapon was slightly altered by its manufacturer, renamed and put back on the 
market again legally as the M951. 
</P>
<P>
 Also offered as prizes are six pocket-sized Derringer pistols, a 9-millimeter 
pistol, a bullet reloader and subscriptions to Soldier of Fortune, and Guns and 
Ammo magazines.  
</P>
<P>
 The flyer identifies CAC as a "citizens watchdog group" that "fights financial 
corruption such as bribes, and political corruption such as lying, promoting 
election fraud or supporting laws that violate our civil rights.

LIVE AT FOREST LAWN!; MICHELANGELO PORTRAYALS PACK THE MAUSOLEUM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID COLKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You don't have to be dead to see actor Pablo Marz's one-man show, but it does 
help you get a good seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice a year, Marz, 41, portrays the artist Michelangelo before crowds packed 
into the main room of the Great Mausoleum at Forest Lawn Memorial-Park in 
Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 He has already heard all the jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know how many times I've heard, 'Must be a dead crowd out there,' " 
Marz said Thursday morning as he pulled on a pair of gray, green and red tights 
that are part of his rented Renaissance costume. He was dressing in a small 
rotunda outside the Hall of Commemoration, one of the many crypt-filled 
hallways in the imposing mausoleum. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearby and out of sight, about 250 schoolchildren were taking their seats in 
the Memorial Court of Honor where Marz would perform his "A Visit with 
Michelangelo" show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I also get 'Knock 'em dead' a lot," Marz continued, shaking his head. He was 
fitting breeches over the tights. "But when they hear what this is all about, 
they are impressed. 
</P>
<P>
 "For an actor, this is a good gig." 
</P>
<P>
 And it draws a good crowd. The Michelangelo show, presented just four days a 
year, is free to school groups but has to be booked far in advance. 
Reservations have already been made for the next presentation of the show in 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of the program, which began in 1988 at the park (Forest Lawn 
officials never say cemetery ), is to teach the students a bit about 
Michelangelo's sculptures, several copies of which sit in the Memorial Court. 
The program is also supposed to instill in the students some appreciation for 
the artwork. 
</P>
<P>
 Marz had his work cut out for him. 
</P>
<P>
 Out in the audience sat Michael Player, 10, who was part of the group bused in 
for the show from Ventura Missionary school in Ventura. Michael had heard of 
Michelangelo. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sure," he said, "he's one of the Teenage Ninja Turtles." 
</P>
<P>
 Backstage in the marble-lined rotunda, Marz put on a leather doublet, then a 
gold cape. Park soundman Milan Ubovich, who had filled the court with Italian 
Renaissance choral music for the incoming crowd, came backstage to hook up a 
wireless microphone on the actor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Darling, you look good in a cape," Ubovich told Marz with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 Marz, a veteran of numerous local theater shows, checked his makeup -- which 
included a broken nose like the one Michelangelo got in a childhood fight -- in 
a restroom off the rotunda. He ran water into his only prop, a metal wine 
goblet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have to get dressed in the men's room, my wine goblet is filled with tap 
water and no one brings me coffee," he said with a smile. "It's the life of an 
actor." 
</P>
<P>
 It was show time. From the front of the court, Education Affairs Director J. 
Carol Winn gave him an enthusiastic introduction. 
</P>
<P>
 "Let's give a big hand and welcome to Michelangelo!" she told the kids. They 
clapped politely and Marz entered the court, his cape trailing. 
</P>
<P>
 " Bonjourno !" he called out in an Italian accent, took a drink from the 
goblet and asked the students how many were artists. About 20 hands shot up. 
</P>
<P>
 "An artist does not just paint," Marz proclaimed. "If you dance, make music, 
act, then you are also an artist. Everyone has a gift, inside, to create." 
</P>
<P>
 He told them of Michelangelo's early years in Florence and of the boy's father 
objecting to art as a profession. From the many biographies and reference books 
Marz had studied, he told them of Michelangelo's financial struggles at a time 
when only the church and the rich could afford to commission art. 
</P>
<P>
 Marz's performance never delved into the cutesy asides and condensation too 
often present in children's shows. He instead held the attention of the room 
with his acting ability and passion for his subject. 
</P>
<P>
 As Marz came to each statue in the room, he explained why it was a great work. 
"In my time, this scene was portrayed always as very sad, very painful and 
mournful," he said, pointing out "La Pieta," the famous scene of Mary holding 
Christ's body after the Crucifixion. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to change that; I wanted to show how Christ is finally at peace," he 
said, pointing out Mary's serene expression.  
</P>
<P>
 Marz never imagined when he took up acting as a student at Los Angeles City 
College, then with a variety of coaches, including Nina Foch, that he would end 
up doing a show for students in a cemetery. 
</P>
<P>
 He recently acted in a couple of action films for a small production company, 
but those movies are headed straight for video. And he has not appeared on any 
of the major stages of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 His name will probably never be so well-known as that of Clark Gable, Carole 
Lombard, Jean Harlow and others at rest in this very mausoleum. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Michelangelo program and the other small productions he does for 
children keep him going while he strives for higher-level acting jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 He told youngsters of the three months the artist spent in a 33-by-9-foot room 
where he hid during a time of political oppression and of the drawings he made 
on the walls during that time. "All I could do to maintain my sanity is to 
draw," he said. "I found out that it is not enough to create art just to sell, 
it makes me a human being." 
</P>
<P>
 The youngest students were starting to stir, but Marz was nearing the end of 
his presentation. Outside the hall, the next group of students was gathering. 
Marz will do three shows this day and three more the next. 
</P>
<P>
 "You all can make art and create. You cannot let anyone take that from you," 
he told them. "You must nurture that, feed it, let it blossom like a flower." 
</P>
<P>
 The applause was rousing.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SAN FERNANDO; CHAMBER TO HOLD 2 CANDIDATES FORUMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 In what is considered the official kickoff of the election season, the San 
Fernando Chamber of Commerce on Wednesday will hold two forums for City Council 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 All eight contenders for three at-large seats in the April 12 election will 
outline their platforms and answer questions during a noontime forum at the 
Odyssey Restaurant in Granada Hills. Reservations are required. 
</P>
<P>
 The candidates also will appear from 7 to 9 p.m. in the San Fernando City 
Council Chambers to make statements and answer questions from the chamber and 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
 Questions at the evening forum will be screened by a panel of the San Fernando 
Chamber of Commerce, according to chamber Vice President Bruce Cohen. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're only screened for redundancy and unnecessary attacks on character," 
Cohen said. "But some tough questions do get asked." 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents include Mayor Dan Acuna, 53, a realtor seeking his third 
consecutive term; Doude Wysbeek, 54, owner of an electric shop, seeking a third 
term, and Dr. Jose Hernandez, 63, an urban studies professor at Cal State 
Northridge seeking his second consecutive term. 
</P>
<P>
 They are being challenged by Edward Guzman, 37, a state employment counselor 
and member of the city's Transportation and Safety Commission; John Becker, 41, 
a service representative of the Automobile Club of Southern California and a 
Transportation and Safety Commission member; Joanne Baltierrez, 36, a program 
associate for the Coro Southern California nonprofit educational foundation; 
Arthur Kay, 53, a workers' compensation attorney, and Raul Godinez, 31, an 
engineer. 
</P>
<P>
 All of the candidates have filed brief statements and qualification forms with 
the city clerk. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious issue to emerge in the campaign has been the City Council's 
response to the earthquake-related rupture of an oil pipeline that runs through 
San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 As members of the Transportation and Safety Commission, Becker and Guzman have 
pressed the council to move part of the pipe that runs beneath the schoolyard 
of O'Melveny Elementary School and investigate why the crude oil that spilled 
just outside the city boundaries and beside the school erupted in flames. 
Baltierrez also has rallied residents and pressed the issue with the council. 
</P>
<P>
 Acuna, Wysbeek and Hernandez have noted the council's refusal to grant another 
franchise agreement to the pipeline owner, based on safety concerns. The 
franchise expired in 1989, although the Four Corners Pipeline Co. continued to 
pump oil during negotiations. GEOFFREY MOHAN

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: ARLETA; PAIR SAY IT'S THEIR PLACE TO HONOR VETERANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 On a busy section of Osborne Street just west of the Golden State Freeway, in 
the middle of a row of small stucco houses, stands a house with yellow shingles 
that look like tattered pieces of paper -- casualties of time as much as the 
recent earthquake. The house looks like many of the others, except for the 15 
American flags on tall poles staked out in the front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 "In memory of all veterans that have served their country in its time of 
need," reads a large white sign out front. 
</P>
<P>
 The rather imposingly named U.S. Veterans Remembrance Memorial is a small 
monument comprising the flag stand and a veterans memorabilia room established 
by two veterans, Joseph A. Crowley and William F. Knuth, at their home at 13645 
Osborne St. more than 10 years ago. Crowley, 71, is a World War II Army veteran 
who was wounded in the Battle of the Bulge. Knuth, 57, served as an Air Force 
medic in Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 They set up the memorial in 1983, in response to the suicide bomber attack 
that killed 241 American Marines and sailors at Beirut International Airport on 
Oct. 23, 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, the memorial has become something of a landmark that catches the 
eye of commuters who whiz by day after day.  
</P>
<P>
 In the year of its inception, the memorial drew visits from Olympic athletes, 
gifts of flags from Dan Quayle and Wayne Gretsky, and thousands of people 
during a veterans remembrance parade for which Osborne was blocked off from 
Canterbury to Arleta avenues. 
</P>
<P>
 In the front room, visitors can see the hat of a sailor who had been on the 
battleship New Jersey, which sped to Lebanon after the 1983 bombing. 
</P>
<P>
 Other mementos include medals, two brass artillery shells with "Verdun" -- the 
name of a famous World War I battle -- hand-tooled into their sides, and 
helmets from the two world wars. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley and Knuth have played host to few visitors since the earthquake 
damaged their home. 
</P>
<P>
 Crowley estimates earthquake damage to the house at $32,000. The floor in some 
rooms sunk as much as three inches, cracks appeared on exterior and interior 
walls, and the ceiling of the sun room buckled and split. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to their main activity -- flying flags for deceased military 
veterans -- the veterans also run up Old Glory for police officers and 
firefighters who have been killed, and recently honored those who died in the 
earthquake.  
</P>
<P>
 "They were a part of our Valley, and we are a part of theirs," Crowley says. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Crowley and Knuth collect and distribute clothing, food and toys 
for veterans and needy people in their neighborhood. KAY HWANGBO

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; TEEN CENTER HOPES TO REOPEN BY AUG. 1 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JENNIFER OLDHAM 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Community leaders have rallied to the aid of the Glendale Teen Center, which 
closed earlier this week due to lack of funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Founder Sheila Ellis said she has received numerous calls from individuals and 
organizations wanting to donate time, space and money to the 16-month-old 
center, a nonprofit facility that provides a place for teen-agers to come after 
school to socialize, study and participate in a variety of programs. 
</P>
<P>
 One resident wrote a $1,000 check after hearing of the center's financial 
woes. The YWCA has donated meeting space for the center's 12-member youth 
council, and the Oakmont League Juniors plan to make a cash donation. Realtor 
Ante Trinidad has volunteered to find space for the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis, who said the board was forced to choose between closing the facility 
and incurring debt to keep it open, emphasized that residents can pledge money 
without actually writing a check. When the board reaches its $100,000 goal -- 
the amount needed to operate the center for one year -- it will "call in" the 
pledges, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The center's board has set an Aug. 1 target date to reopen the center, pending 
receipt of $100,000 for operating costs or the donation of space to house the 
center. The board pays $24,000 each year to rent the current facility at 115 E. 
Lexington Drive. 
</P>
<P>
 The center, which provided more than 275 ninth- through 12th-graders with a 
place to study, socialize and have fun each month, was created after students 
pointed out the need for after-school activities in the city, Ellis said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Lt. Jack Bilheimer voiced concern about teen-agers loitering around 
city facilities such as the library because they can no longer visit the center 
after school. 
</P>
<P>
 "The name of the game from a crime standpoint is to keep kids busy; they need 
somewhere to go after school," said Bilheimer, a center board member. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Larry Zarian said he will volunteer to help center operators develop a 
long-range strategy to reopen the facility. "It will be all of our roles to 
make sure that this organization doesn't fall by the wayside," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Daily High School Principal Ted Tiffany agreed, saying it's difficult for 
nonprofit organizations to rely solely on private donations to keep afloat in 
recessionary times. 
</P>
<P>
 Ellis is upbeat about the center's future, saying the youth council voted 
Wednesday to continue operation of a conflict resolution program by offering it 
to community groups that need to resolve arguments among teen-agers. The 
council plans to hold events to raise money to reopen the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time that the community has come together to assist in 
the five-year effort to bring a teen center to Glendale, Ellis said. More than 
$40,000 in contributions were made several years ago to renovate the present 
facility, she added. JENNIFER OLDHAM

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: BURBANK; HIGH SCHOOL OFFERS REAL WORLD LEARNING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Educators at John Burroughs High School have designed a new program to give 
students the flexibility of going straight into the working world or on to 
college. 
</P>
<P>
 The Industrial Technology and Engineering Academy will take students with a 
variety of interests, from printing, graphics and auto repair to computer 
drafting and engineering, and give them the experience they need. 
</P>
<P>
 But the academy, which is scheduled to begin operations in the fall, will also 
be a college-preparatory program in which students take advanced academic 
classes. They also will be able to work with professionals in the jobs they are 
interested in. 
</P>
<P>
 For Keith Myatt, who oversees specialized programs at Burroughs, the reason 
for such a program became clear on a recent field trip, when about 30 students 
visited an engineering firm in Irvine. 
</P>
<P>
 A staffer told them: "Five years ago, I was where you are now. You really have 
a future doing this," recalled Myatt, who watched as the students took the 
words in. "It really was a magical moment." 
</P>
<P>
 The Tech Academy, as it will be commonly called, will join two other academies 
already established at John Burroughs, a Cinema and Video Academy, run with the 
help of Warner Bros., and a Business Academy. Educators are also planning two 
other academies, one for health sciences, run with the help of Thompson 
Memorial Hospital, and a Travel and Tourism Academy. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think that a 14th-grade education is pretty much going to be a minimum," 
Myatt said. ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: LAKE VIEW TERRACE; GLITCHES WARNED IN METHANE CONVERSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GEOFFREY MOHAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city-hired consultant has warned that an unexpected glitch may make a 
planned methane-to-electricity plant at Lopez Canyon Landfill unprofitable. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the plant will be powered by the methane gas produced by decomposing 
trash buried in the 392-acre landfill in Lake View Terrace, it will require a 
natural gas "boost" to keep the generator operating at peak efficiency because 
the amount of methane seeping from below ground decreases over time, according 
to Drew Sones, manager of the Los Angeles Bureau of Sanitation's Recycling 
Division. 
</P>
<P>
 The consulting firm CSI Resource Systems Inc. of Boston has said the cost of 
natural gas will escalate at too steep a rate, eventually eating up any profit 
margin, Sones said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is not so much the initial price of the gas, Sones said, but a 
price escalation of 4.5% per year. The price of the electricity to be sold by 
the plant only escalates at 2.5%. "At some point, those two will cross," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants predict that profits won't become losses until about 15 years 
into the plant's expected 30-year life span, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even so, the company attempting to build the plant, Lopez Canyon Energy 
Partners L.P., now must attempt to get a better deal on the natural gas, 
possibly by offering a natural gas company some stake in the plant, according 
to Sones. 
</P>
<P>
 Tudor Williams, a member of the partnership and project manager for the plant, 
said Thursday that he is negotiating with at least one gas company and may have 
resolved the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 The plant itself is expected to generate very little profit, if any, Williams 
said. But federal tax incentives offer its owners lucrative credits worth $12 
million to $14 million over the lifetime of the project, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city administrative office and Bureau of Sanitation have been examining 
the proposal since September to ensure that it is technologically and 
financially feasible, said Richard Hart, principal administrative analyst. 
</P>
<P>
 At stake for the city are about $1 million per year in revenues or reduced 
costs, cheaper electrical rates and a chance to convert an air pollution 
nuisance to good use. 
</P>
<P>
 Faced with complaints from nearby residents and fines from environmental 
agencies, the city three years ago began channeling and burning off the methane 
seeping from trash buried at the landfill, slated for closure in February, 
1996. Methane is a natural byproduct of trash decay. 
</P>
<P>
 The city plans to buy all of the electricity generated by the 30-megawatt 
plant and also receive at least a 21% royalty on all plant revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Hart said he should complete his analysis of the project, with the 
partnership's response to the gas price issue, within a few weeks. It then goes 
to the mayor's office and City Council. GEOFFREY MOHAN

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; CSUN STUDENTS LEARN LESSONS AT GRADE SCHOOLS 
</P>

 The Jan. 17 earthquake ousted thousands of Cal State Northridge students from 
their regular classrooms, leaving many of them frustrated, disoriented and 
inconvenienced. But for about 250 education methods students, who now take 
their classes in spare classrooms on elementary school campuses, the disaster 
proved to be a lesson in disguise. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a breath of fresh air," said Glenn Robertson, 22, of Chatsworth, who 
takes his classes at Calahan Street Elementary School just blocks from the CSUN 
campus. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact that we are at an elementary school helps us more than anything. You 
get to see the kids, learn what a schedule is like, watch how teachers organize 
their classes." 
</P>
<P>
 When the earthquake ravaged the department's regular classrooms, professors in 
the education department called on their connection with elementary schools to 
find space for their students. The 18-month program already included 
student-teaching at local elementary schools, but prior to the earthquake, 
methods classes were always at CSUN. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, the arrangement that came about spontaneously in eight elementary schools 
as a solution to a space problem, seems to many principals, professors and 
students, a logical, natural situation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would love to do this all the time," said Brenda Lakin-Clapp, a 22-year 
veteran professor of education at CSUN, during a break in her class at Calahan. 
"It makes more sense to be in this environment. There are some things you just 
can't teach in the confines of a university classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 In light of the disaster, the Los Angeles Unified School District waived the 
fees that would normally be attached to use of the classrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The CSUN students sit at children's desks raised to their maximum height and 
use bulletin boards and chalkboards to practice teaching methods. They hear the 
bells ring and see children walking to and from recess and lunch. At most of 
the schools there is not yet any direct interaction between the schoolchildren 
and the CSUN students, but principals and professors say the possibility for 
such cooperation is enormous. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sets a wonderful precedent," said Rick Wetzell, principal of Calahan. 
"It's endless what they could do." SUSAN BYRNES

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: JUDGE CONVICTS DEAF MAN IN GANG KILLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Concluding an unusual and complicated case, a hearing-impaired judge on 
Thursday convicted a deaf man of second-degree murder in the shooting of 
another deaf man during an apparent gang-related dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Stalling what promised to be a lengthy trial with a host of sign language 
interpreters, Val Lamar Smith, 23, of South-Central Los Angeles agreed Tuesday 
to waive his right to a trial and let a judge decide his fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Going into Thursday's brief hearing, Smith understood that he would almost 
certainly be convicted in a procedure technically called a "submission on 
transcript," but generally known as a "slow plea." 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing transcripts and other documents, Van Nuys Superior Court Judge 
Michael J. Farrell, who has less than 50% hearing in both ears, found Smith 
guilty in the Jan. 10, 1992, slaying of James E. Powell Jr., 27, in a Van Nuys 
apartment. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge sentenced Smith to 15 years to life, and then asked the defendant to 
take advantage of any opportunity he finds in state prison. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to think there's a lot of good in you and you can build on that," 
Farrell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith agreed to the seldom-used "slow plea" because he plans to appeal the 
case based on a key evidentiary ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defendant admits nothing," defense attorney Tony Bryan said. "It is 
understood the court was probably going to convict." 
</P>
<P>
 As a jury waited in the hallway Tuesday for opening statements, Smith said he 
would forgo a trial after Farrell ruled that a damaging confession given to 
police could be admitted as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Bryan fought for seven days to keep the videotaped statement out of court, 
arguing that Smith clearly invoked both his right to remain silent and his 
right to a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Farrell agreed that Smith asked for an attorney, but he ruled that police did 
not understand his request because of "an ambiguity" created by a sign language 
interpreter. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith eventually told police that he fired two shots into Powell's leg and 
body, but insisted that he did not fire the fatal shot to the victim's head. 
</P>
<P>
 The defense attorney maintains that the American Sign Language interpreter 
needed a second interpreter to translate Smith's use of sign language slang.

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: TOPANGA; STATE RETURNS SIGNS PROTESTING PROJECT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Caltrans workers have removed about 100 homemade signs from Topanga Canyon 
Boulevard but returned them after community members tracked the placards to a 
Caltrans storage site. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got over a 100 complaints from as far away as Santa Barbara," Dennis 
Cutting, a state Department of Transportation maintenance supervisor, said 
Thursday about the signs, which were posted to protest a proposed housing 
development. "So we took them down." 
</P>
<P>
 The plywood signs came in all different sizes and had dotted the road from 
Mulholland Drive to Pacific Coast Highway. Because the project involves funding 
connected to the Walt Disney family, the signs read "Please don't Mickey Mouse 
around with our canyon," "We don't need Di ey here" and "The night we drove Ol' 
Disney down." 
</P>
<P>
 They were placed to protest the proposed Canyon Oaks Estates housing 
development in Topanga, which would include a private golf course and 97 custom 
home sites on 257 acres at the top of Topanga Canyon, about three miles south 
of the Ventura Freeway. The project is funded by the trust fund of the late 
Sharon Disney Lund, daughter of the late Walt Disney. 
</P>
<P>
 The project "has really triggered artistic Angst," said Colin Penno, editor of 
the Topanga Messenger, a local newspaper. "At first, it was three or four 
(protest signs), then more went up." 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Snyder, a Caltrans spokesman, said the signs were taken down because 
they were on state property. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will continue to be removed if they are put on the state right of way," 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Signs cannot be placed on state property unless an encroachment permit is 
obtained, but Snyder said residents can place the signs on private property. 
</P>
<P>
 Rebecca Barkin, a 14-year resident of Topanga, said a friend with a cellular 
phone called from the Caltrans storage lot near Castellammare Drive to report 
sighting the infamous signs, and she sped over to see if she could retrieve 
them. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a really funny sight," Barkin said. "The workers were putting them out 
carefully because I think they respected what the canyon families are standing 
for." 
</P>
<P>
 Barkin said the signs were a way for Topangans to express their feelings about 
the impending housing project and will probably go back up this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 A few signs were made by children, such as Barkin's 11-year-old son, Zack, at 
Topanga School to give them an outlet for their feelings. 
</P>
<P>
 "We tried to think up ways that the kids could have their say (about the 
project)," Barkin said. "After all, it is our children who aren't going to have 
the open space." JEANNETTE REGALADO

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTHRIDGE; SCHOLARSHIPS OKD FOR 2 KILLED IN QUAKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A student-sponsored effort to set up scholarships in honor of two students who 
died in the Northridge Meadows Apartments complex in the Jan. 17 earthquake has 
borne fruit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Associated Student Senate on Tuesday approved a measure that would set up 
two scholarships of at least $1,000 annually in the names of Jaime Reyes and 
Manuel Sandoval, two Cal State Northridge students who lost their lives when 
the apartment complex collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Sixteen people died when the second story of the complex, located a short 
distance from the campus, crashed into the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandoval, 24, a computer science major born in Mexico, had recently moved into 
the apartment with Reyes, 19, and Reyes' girlfriend, Myrna Velasquez, 18, who 
also died in the collapse.  
</P>
<P>
 Reyes apparently died while trying to shield Velasquez from the rubble. A 
fourth roommate survived the collapse.  
</P>
<P>
 The scholarship resolution was sponsored by student senator Tadzio Garcia, a 
senior in music, who said he introduced the measure to assuage his own feelings 
of fear after the quake. He said the deaths of Sandoval and Reyes struck a deep 
chord with CSUN students, many of whom also live in multi-story apartment 
complexes near the epicenter.  
</P>
<P>
 Associated Student administrators said the first scholarships will likely be 
awarded next semester through the campus financial aid office. The money will 
come from student fees.  
</P>
<P>
 CSUN students pay fees to the Associated Students each semester. A portion of 
the fees go for financial aid. That portion was recently raised from $1 to $2 
per student per semester, increasing the amount available for scholarships.

REPORT FINDS NO DRUGS IN YOUTH'S BODY; CORONER: NORTHRIDGE BOY WHO KILLED HIS 
FATHER AND AN OFFICER BEFORE SHOOTING HIMSELF WAS NOT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF 
ALCOHOL OR NARCOTICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Troubled teen-ager Christopher Golly was not under the influence of drugs or 
alcohol when he fatally shot his father and then ambushed Los Angeles police 
with an assault rifle, killing rookie cop Christy Lynne Hamilton, the county's 
top medical examiner said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher killed his father, beckoned police to his Northridge home by 
calling 911 to report the slaying, then opened fire on them before ultimately 
killing himself early on the morning of Feb. 22.  
</P>
<P>
 After Christopher's suicide, there was widespread speculation among his 
friends and classmates that the youth's rampage was the result of his use of 
methamphetamine, a drug that can cause users to become violent and 
temperamental. 
</P>
<P>
 But Los Angeles County's chief medical examiner-coroner, Dr. Lakshmanan 
Sathyavagiswaran, said blood test results indicated that the 17-year-old had no 
alcohol or drugs of any kind in his system -- not even residual levels -- on 
the day of the shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "All we can say is it was not present, that there was no evidence that he had 
taken it in the recent past," Sathyavagiswaran said. He said the blood tests 
were taken the day after Christopher killed himself as an elite unit of Special 
Weapons and Tactics officers waited outside the Amestoy Avenue home where he 
had just killed his father, Steven, 49, with an AR-15 semiautomatic assault 
rifle. 
</P>
<P>
 Methamphetamine stays in the bloodstream between 12 and 36 hours, but once a 
person dies, whatever level was in the blood at the time of death remains 
constant, Sathyavagiswaran said. Christopher is believed to have killed himself 
shortly after shooting his father in the head, calling 911 and then opening 
fire on Hamilton and other officers as they responded to calls of shots fired 
at the house. 
</P>
<P>
 Sathyavagiswaran said the tests, which were "more or less final," also looked 
for drugs such as cocaine, narcotics and angel dust, or PCP. 
</P>
<P>
 When told the test results Thursday, a woman who lives in the Golly home said 
she knew "all along" that drugs were not the root cause of Christopher's bloody 
rampage. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it made a difference at all," said Connie McGovern, 21, who was 
present when the boy killed his father, before fleeing the house. "Either way, 
he would have done it." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why Christopher killed his father and lured police into an ambush, 
McGovern said his frequent use of methamphetamine, or speed, for about a year 
may have been a contributing factor, but other factors also were at play. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only Chris knows why he did it," McGovern said. "When you're young, everybody 
dislikes police. You aren't mature enough to respect what they are doing." 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton had graduated from the Los Angeles Police Academy just four days 
before answering the call to go to the Gollys' house, and had been on the force 
for just a month before becoming only the second female Los Angeles police 
officer to die in the line of duty. She was shot once, just above the armhole 
in her bullet-resistant vest, after getting out of her squad car. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton died about an hour later at a Northridge hospital, with her father -- 
a retired Los Angeles police detective -- and Police Chief Willie L. Williams 
at her side. Her death has attracted national attention and calls by gun 
control advocates for curbs on the kind of military-appearing semiautomatic 
rifles that Christopher used to kill her.

CON ARTIST USES CHARM AND LIES TO STEAL CAR, POLICE SAY; CRIME: MAN WHO CLAIMS 
TO BE AN ASSISTANT TO A ROCK STAR ALSO DISAPPOINTS A GROUP OF QUADRIPLEGICS.

 A charming scam artist claiming to be an assistant to rock guitarist Eddie Van 
Halen successfully used his chicanery in the San Fernando Valley this week, 
convincing a nurse to give him the keys to her convertible, police said 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the man not only stole the car but disappointed 22 quadriplegics, whom he 
had promised the musician would visit and possibly play for. 
</P>
<P>
 The thief, calling himself Steven Brokaw, briefly checked himself into St. 
John's Regional Medical Center in Oxnard Monday night, complaining of chest 
pains. 
</P>
<P>
 While there, he won over staff members by saying that he was an assistant to 
Van Halen and that he was going to get them all tour jackets, said Detective 
Tim Wisenhunt of the Los Angeles Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 During a conversation, the man told Carol Balta, a nursing supervisor at the 
hospital who also works with quadriplegics at New Start Homes in Chatsworth, 
that he would give her and her daughter tickets to a Janet Jackson concert. He 
also promised that he would ask Van Halen to stop by Tuesday to meet the 
quadriplegics and maybe play a few songs. 
</P>
<P>
 True to his word, the man arrived at New Start about 9 a.m. Tuesday, but 
without Van Halen. Nevertheless, he assured Balta that the guitarist would 
arrive later. In the meantime, he offered to take her red convertible, which he 
noticed was dirty, to a nearby carwash, claiming he knew the owner. He never 
returned, Wisenhunt said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I really believed him," Balta said. "He followed through. He had the kind of 
personality where he could sell the Man on the Moon. But I can see now he had 
it all planned." 
</P>
<P>
 The man left a Camaro in the parking lot. After checking the car's license 
plate, Wisenhunt discovered it was stolen and quickly realized this was not the 
first victim of the scam. 
</P>
<P>
 Two weeks earlier in Antioch, near San Francisco, a hospital nurse had given 
the keys to her car to a man who came to the facility complaining of chest 
pains. 
</P>
<P>
 "He actually took her out on a date, then took her car," Balta said. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman told police that she was too embarrassed to cooperate with them. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was captured on videotape by St. John's surveillance cameras, and 
police plan to distribute his picture to the public, Wisenhunt said.  
</P>
<P>
 According to people who had come in contact with him, the man had an 
exceptional knowledge of the Valley and police suspect that he was or is an 
area resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Van Halen's manager denied that the man worked with the rock star and said 
that Van Halen is considering playing for the kids, according to Balta, an 
Oxnard resident. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was so smooth and so good," she said. "I just want this guy caught."

CONSOLIDATION TO CLOSE VENTURA COUNTY CLINICAL LAB; JOBS: COMPANY PLANS TO 
REASSIGN DAMON CORP. WORKERS TO A NEW LABORATORY NEAR BURBANK AIRPORT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JAMES MAIELLA JR., SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Newbury Park clinical laboratory that employs 516 people will be closing its 
doors by September in a company consolidation that Thousand Oaks officials say 
should have only a limited effect on the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Nathan Headley, president and chief executive of Physicians Clinical 
Laboratory Inc., announced this week the slated closure of the Damon Corp. 
facility as part of his company's recent $51-million acquisition of Damon. 
</P>
<P>
 Local officials said the closure would have little effect on the local economy 
because it would be offset by incoming business and planned expansions. 
</P>
<P>
 The Thousand Oaks City Council on Tuesday approved biotechnology giant Amgen's 
proposal to make room for 6,300 new workers over the next 25 years by building 
additional offices, warehouses, manufacturing plants and research labs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm certainly glad that the city in their wisdom passed the approval of the 
Amgen Specific Plan so that they can make up the shortfall that we may feel 
from this closure," said Steve Rubenstein, president of the Conejo Valley 
Chamber of Commerce. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're extremely lucky and blessed in our community in that we're a highly 
desirable place to live and there have been a number of companies looking to 
our area after the earthquake for their relocation purposes." 
</P>
<P>
 Headley said his company plans to reassign workers from the Newbury Park 
facility and a PCL lab in Glendale to a newly built laboratory near Burbank 
Airport. He said, however, that some of the positions in Newbury Park and 
Glendale will be lost in the transition. 
</P>
<P>
 "There will be some downsizing," he said. "It's impossible for me to tell you 
how much at this point. Obviously when you put two large facilities together 
there will be some downsizing." 
</P>
<P>
 About 225 of the Damon workers live in the Thousand Oaks/Newbury Park area, 
company officials said, with the rest coming from both Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties. 
</P>
<P>
 In mapping its future strategy, Headley said PCL had two reasons for deciding 
to close two of its facilities and build a new one. 
</P>
<P>
 Headley said combining the two facilities would make the business more 
efficient and centrally located. 
</P>
<P>
 "The second reason is that Newbury Park is substantially removed from the 
greater Los Angeles area, putting a lot of strain on courier routes. So, 
logistically, it doesn't make sense to maintain an area that far away." 
</P>
<P>
 PCL conducts 16,000 clinical tests daily statewide, and after the merger takes 
effect it will be conducting 25,000 tests daily, Headley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are a clinical laboratory operation," Headley said. "We perform laboratory 
tests in support of doctors' offices, doctor groups, clinics and hospitals in 
quite large volume." 
</P>
<P>
 Thousand Oaks Councilman Frank Schillo said he was disappointed to hear of 
Damon's planned exodus. 
</P>
<P>
 "How depressing," he said. "We enjoy people moving in and we don't enjoy 
businesses leaving. I think that if the city can be involved in helping in some 
way to keep them here, that's one thing. But if it's a business decision to 
consolidate, I feel kind of helpless."

PACOIMA RESIDENTS PRESS FOR INCLUSION IN 'EMPOWERMENT ZONE'; ECONOMY: 
SOUTH-CENTRAL, EAST L.A. ALSO LOBBY COUNCIL PANEL. THE DESIGNATION COULD MEAN 
$100 MILLION IN AID.

<P>
 Vying for limited benefits, Pacoima residents and business owners urged a City 
Council panel Thursday to include the economically depressed community in a 
federal "empowerment zone" to take advantage of grants, tax breaks and job 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 But dozens of representatives from South-Central, East Los Angeles and the 
harbor area also lobbied to be included in the proposed 20-square-mile zone, 
making it likely that some neighborhoods will be left out. 
</P>
<P>
 "The northeast Valley has been ignored for many years in receiving the kind of 
benefits the empowerment zone provides," said Penny Flynn, a spokeswoman for 
the Valley Industry and Commerce Assn., which represents 350 businesses in the 
San Fernando Valley. "It's time the Valley got its fair share." 
</P>
<P>
 Lenora Ramirez, a representative of VOICE, an association of religious groups 
in the Valley, added that Pacoima should be included in the zone because it 
suffers from gang violence, high unemployment and a housing shortage. 
</P>
<P>
 The testimony was heard at a joint meeting of the council's economic 
development and housing committees, which will make a recommendation to the 
full council on which neighborhoods should be included in an empowerment zone 
application to the federal Housing and Urban Development Department. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting, which was the first public hearing in Los Angeles on the 
formation of an empowerment zone, attracted about 100 residents and business 
owners. 
</P>
<P>
 Empowerment zones are an idea championed by President Clinton as a way to 
revive troubled inner-city neighborhoods. Each zone will receive up to $100 
million in special aid and various tax breaks. In addition, smaller zones, 
called "enterprise communities," can receive about $3 million in grants for 
social services programs. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the zones can be no larger than 20 square miles and contain a 
population of 200,000. That represents only 4.4% of the city's area and only 
5.7% of its population. The zone does not have to be contiguous. 
</P>
<P>
 At times in the testimony, the representatives of some of the city's most 
economically depressed communities began a contest of "one upmanship" to 
demonstrate that they lived in the most needy neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know what Watts is and looks like: a garbage dump," said a representative 
of a Watts community group. 
</P>
<P>
 A businesswoman from San Pedro created a stir among some audience members when 
she said: "We have persistent needs, but we didn't riot" in the 1992 civil 
disturbances. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Rita Walters, who represents an area hard hit by the riots, said 
the city will select the communities for the empowerment zone based on need and 
"regardless of what their past activities were or were not." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the northeast Valley is already included in a state "enterprise" zone 
that offers tax credits to businesses that hire workers who were receiving 
government assistance, and tax credits for sales tax paid on machinery. 
</P>
<P>
 The area is also included in a "revitalization" zone established after the 
riots that uses tax incentives to promote business renewal. 
</P>
<P>
 If Pacoima is included in an empowerment zone, businesses in the area can 
benefit from the tax breaks provided by all of the special zones.

SHERIFF'S DEPUTY ARRESTED IN DRUG STING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A Los Angeles County sheriff's deputy who had been under surveillance for 
about a month was arrested when he tried to purchase a kilogram of cocaine from 
an undercover officer on a downtown street, authorities said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 William Barr, 25, a 4 1/2-year veteran of the department, was arrested about 
2:15 p.m. Wednesday near Alameda and Macy streets, said Deputy Larry Mead, a 
Sheriff's Department spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as he exchanged the money and took possession of the cocaine, 
undercover guys moved in," Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives later found two 9-millimeter semiautomatic handguns in Barr's car, 
Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his arrest, Barr worked as a jail deputy at the North County 
Correctional Facility, one of five jail facilities that house more than 10,000 
inmates at the sprawling Peter J. Pitchess Honor Rancho in Castaic, Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives assigned to the department's Internal Criminal Investigations 
Bureau, which conducted the operation, did not indicate whether Barr planned to 
sell drugs to inmates at the facility, Deputy Rich Erickson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The internal unit learned that Barr had inquired about a possible cocaine 
purchase through an anonymous tip, Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Barr was booked on suspicion of possession of cocaine for sale at the Men's 
Central Jail in Downtown Los Angeles, and was being held on $100,000 bail, Mead 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is jailed in a section of the facility reserved for defendants of high 
profile cases and those whose lives would be endangered if they were placed 
with the general jail population, Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 He is scheduled to be arraigned at the Criminal Courts Building at 8:30 a.m. 
today, Mead said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rickey Ross, an 18-year veteran of the department, is now on trial for 
allegedly attempting to purchase 22 pounds of cocaine from a federal drug 
agent.

EARTHQUAKE / THE ROAD TO RECOVERY; SEISMIC EXPERTS DIFFER ON PACOIMA DAM; 
TEMBLOR: CALTECH PROFESSOR SAYS IT MIGHT NOT HAVE HELD IF FULL. OFFICIALS 
MARVEL AT MASSIVE GROUND MOTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Pacoima Dam survived a pounding by the Northridge earthquake, but the huge 
ground motions recorded there Jan. 17 should cause dam builders and operators 
in seismic zones worldwide to re-examine the safety of their structures, a dam 
expert said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Appearing in Burbank before the state Seismic Safety Commission, Caltech 
engineering professor John F. Hall said he believed the 365-foot-tall dam in 
the San Gabriel Mountains, which will require costly repairs, might not "have 
remained intact" if the quake had struck on one of the rare occasions when its 
reservoir was full. 
</P>
<P>
 But Vernon H. Persson, state dam safety chief, said he believed the massive 
impoundment would not "have failed even if full." 
</P>
<P>
 While noting that area dams came through the quake without a single failure, 
commissioners and earthquake experts marveled at the enormous ground 
accelerations measured at Pacoima Dam, which reached a peak level of twice the 
force of gravity. 
</P>
<P>
 When "people around the world involved in dam engineering see the records, 
they're just going to be amazed," Hall said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say the quake caused shaking far stronger than would be expected in a 
6.8 quake. Ground motion recordings also confirmed that there is something 
about the setting of the dam -- perhaps involving the steep canyon walls -- 
that amplifies earthquake shaking. Ground motion recordings were so high there 
during the 1971 Sylmar quake that some experts attributed them to instrument 
error. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall, who led a quake reconnaissance team for the Earthquake Engineering 
Research Institute, said ground motion readings at the dam should not be 
dismissed as a local anomaly because many dams bridge steep canyons. 
</P>
<P>
 Persson, chief of dam safety for the state Department of Water Resources, said 
that dams, in general, did well in the quake. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 108 state-supervised dams in the quake area, only five, including Pacoima, 
sustained enough damage to need detailed inspection and repairs -- and Persson 
said even those pose no immediate threat to public safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The state lacks jurisdiction over about a dozen federal dams in the region, 
and a commission staff member said the Army Corps of Engineers had declined a 
request to address the panel. Persson said corps officials had inspected the 
area's federal dams "and said they were in good shape." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles County Department of Public Works, which uses Pacoima Dam for 
flood control, has hired consultants to assess damage to the 65-year-old 
structure -- once the tallest concrete arch dam in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 The quake created a two-inch gap between the top of the dam and a massive 
concrete block connecting it to the canyon wall. It also caused that concrete 
connection to move about a half-inch downstream relative to the dam's crest. 
</P>
<P>
 Damage from the Sylmar quake was similar, although less severe, and the dam 
was repaired and strengthened at a cost of about $3 million. Ken Swanson, a 
supervising engineer with the public works department, said officials hope by 
the end of the month to have a preliminary estimate of repairs needed after the 
Northridge quake. 
</P>
<P>
 As a precaution, the reservoir pool is being kept at a maximum elevation of 
1,884 feet -- 66 feet below the spillway -- where it was when the earthquake 
struck. 
</P>
<P>
 For several years after the Sylmar quake, state officials restricted water 
levels behind the dam, until convinced it had been adequately repaired and 
strengthened. 
</P>
<P>
 The four other dams include the Los Angeles Reservoir in Sylmar and two old, 
adjacent dams now used as storm drains, according to Mitchell Sakado, an 
engineer with the city Department of Water and Power, who said repairs to the 
structures will cost more than $1 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The fifth dam, built in 1888 and empty, is on Porter Ranch Development Co. 
property at the western end of Chatsworth Street.

 Police are seeking a driver whose vehicle struck a motorcyclist and his 
passenger, who were lying in the roadway after crashing into a van, said a 
California Highway Patrol spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 Grant Gray, 40, and Mary Krone, 38, both of Granada Hills were pronounced dead 
at the scene of the 10:21 p.m. Wednesday crash on the Golden State Freeway near 
Rye Canyon Road in Santa Clarita. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, Gray's motorcycle rear-ended a van traveling 55 m.p.h. 
south on the freeway, CHP Officer Wendy Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray and Krone, both wearing helmets, were struck by at least one car after 
being ejected from the motorcycle, Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't know if they were killed when they hit the pavement or when they 
were struck by another car," Moore said. 
</P>
<P>
 The coroner's office has not released the cause of death. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the van, Carlos Carrillo, 32, of Dinuba was treated at the scene 
for minor injuries. 
</P>
<P>
 Police are investigating the incident as a hit-and-run.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; INMATE SHOT BY GUARD IN STABLE CONDITION 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An inmate at the state prison here remained hospitalized Thursday in stable 
condition recovering from a gunshot wound to his shoulder, a prison spokesman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sergio Ayala, a maximum-security inmate, was shot by a guard Wednesday after 
an undetermined number of inmates began fighting with "manufactured weapons" 
and refused orders to stop, said spokesman Kenn I. Hicks.Ayala, 21, was serving 
a life sentence for first-degree murder and robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 Two other inmates suffered superficial wounds in the fight and were treated by 
prison medical staff. One, identified as Kevin Broussard Barrs, 27, was 
convicted on five counts of robbery. The name of the other inmate injured in 
the altercation was withheld, pending family notification. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday's incident is the third shooting of an inmate by a guard in the past 
month and the fourth since the state prison opened 13 months ago. 
</P>
<P>
 As with all such incidents at the prison, Hicks said an investigation will be 
conducted to determine the facts surrounding the shooting. Staff and inmates 
will be interviewed to determine what precipitated it. 
</P>
<P>
 Although few details of the shooting were available, Hicks said a 
control-booth officer fired a single round from a 9-millimeter rifle, hitting 
Ayala in the left shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials with the state Department of Corrections said guards are permitted 
to shoot inmates to disable them "when absolutely necessary." SHARON MOESER

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; RUNNERS FACE NEW HURDLE AT TRACK; ATHLETICS: 
QUAKE DAMAGED COLLEGE OF THE CANYONS RUNNING TRACK AND STADIUM. UNCERTAINTY 
OVER REPAIRS MAY AFFECT PRACTICE AND COMPETITIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Track and field athletes at College of the Canyons have an additional hurdle 
to clear this season because of the Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 The temblor cracked the stadium's running track and the base of the 
surrounding seating section, leading college officials to declare the area 
off-limits to the public for weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "The track had buckled pretty seriously in some areas, and there was damage to 
the bleacher concrete area," said Sue Bozman, public information officer for 
the college. 
</P>
<P>
 Runners consider the track at College of the Canyons an excellent one because 
of the solid footing it provides, according to members of the Santa Clarita 
Runners Inc., a local running club. 
</P>
<P>
 "The track is probably the best in the valley, based on the type of materials 
they used. You've got consistent conditions all the way through. You're not 
going to have dirt or surface runoff with lower and higher areas," said Dan 
Powers, a club member. 
</P>
<P>
 Track and field season runs February through May, and damage has interrupted 
practice for the college team and scheduled competitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although team members can now use the undamaged section of the facility, that 
only clears the way for events such as high jump, javelin and shotput on the 
interior part of the field. Hurdles and various running events are still 
off-limits. 
</P>
<P>
 "All of the track meets at the college have been relocated," said Joe Gerda, 
college athletic director. "It's a little more complicated than a lot of the 
other damaged areas we're dealing with. The damage isn't as apparent for us." 
</P>
<P>
 School officials are still tallying the damage to the stadium and how much it 
will cost to prevent additional cracking in the event of another quake. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an expensive job," Gerda said. "If they have to redo the facilities, 
that's a $400,000 job -- and that's just the track." 
</P>
<P>
 Gerda said it could take up to six months to fix the damage. If repairs drag 
on, it may cause difficulties for the Santa Clarita high schools that plan to 
use the stadium for graduation ceremonies in June and for football games in the 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The campus is believed to have incurred more than $3 million in damage from 
the Jan. 17 earthquake. Start of the spring semester was delayed a week due to 
the quake, and most of the 6,500 students found themselves taking at least one 
class last month in a set of 21 tents erected on the campus's upper practice 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 As of this week, all displaced students have been moved into portable 
classrooms, Bozman said.

<P>
 The parquet floor didn't matter. The mystique is gone, leaving Boston Celtic 
remnants who last won in January. 
</P>
<P>
 Mark Price led five teammates in double figures Wednesday night as Cleveland 
won its eighth game in a row, 110-96, over the Celtics, who stretched a losing 
streak into a second month and a 13th game. 
</P>
<P>
 Price, who had 32 points and 10 assists, had 13 points in the first quarter. 
Boston never led after Robert Parish scored the first basket of the game on an 
eight-foot jump shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was hot. And when you feel that way, you just go with it," Price said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sherman Douglas had 25 points and Jimmy Oliver 17 for the Celtics, who have 
been as cold as a New England winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Tyrone Hill scored 22 points, Gerald Wilkins 14 and John Williams 13 for 
Cleveland. 
</P>
<P>
 After Parish's jump shot, the Cavaliers scored the next nine points to take 
the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 "Price had an all-world game," Celtic Coach Chris Ford said. "Our defense was 
lacking early in the game. They were hitting wide-open jumpers and taking the 
ball to the basket. 
</P>
<P>
 "You'd expect things to be different at home after our road trip, but they 
weren't." 
</P>
<P>
 Portland 131, Detroit 107 -- Clyde Drexler scored 20 of his 28 points in the 
second half when the Trail Blazers outscored the Pistons, 73-43, at Auburn 
Hills, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory was the seventh in eight games for Portland. 
</P>
<P>
 Utah 106, San Antonio 96 -- Karl Malone scored 24 points and Jeff Hornacek 23 
at San Antonio, where the Jazz continued its recent success against top teams 
and won its seventh in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 Miami 108, Minnesota 100 -- Steve Smith scored eight of the Heat's 11 overtime 
points as Miami blew a 12-point lead in the fourth quarter but won at 
Minneapolis.

BEHIND THE WHEEL / PAUL DEAN: HI! PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Promotional gushing over the 1995 Plymouth/Dodge Neon isn't much ado about a 
nothing automobile. But it is certainly a lot of hype about something not too 
extraordinary. 
</P>
<P>
 During the Super Bowl and Winter Olympics, the breezy new subcompact starred 
in more television commercials than the Coca-Cola polar bears -- although the 
benign lines and looks of Neon aren't as cuddly. 
</P>
<P>
 Automobile magazine fell prey prematurely to the adulation when it named Neon 
its 1994 Car of the Year. That was several months before the vehicle went on 
sale -- and before Chrysler made a liar out of the magazine by advancing the 
car's maiden model year to 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 With an $8,975 sticker for the starter kit -- which includes the bonus of 
double air bags as standard equipment -- Neon has been touted as the biggest 
bargain since Manhattan. Yet that's without basic add-ons. Just automatic 
transmission and air conditioning will bump the price of a basic Neon to 
$11,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Our test vehicle was a mid-range Neon Highline -- Base is the beginner car and 
Sport the top of a three-model lineup -- with bare necessities, crank windows, 
a remote trunk lid that didn't work, chintzy cloth seats and a five-speed 
manual. Its starting sticker: $10,690. 
</P>
<P>
 A $1,851 package bought air conditioning, power locks and mirrors, and less 
consequential goodies. Anti-lock brakes and cruise control added $789 to the 
bill. Less $599 for something called a Dodge Discount -- for a virgin car, 
that's a sales gimmick clumsier than a Fire Clearance Sale sans fire -- and the 
final cost was $13,333. Or competitive with others in the small-car field. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, 1,300 initial Neons were recalled when condensation threatened the 
engine management system. That came two weeks after a recall for a faulty seal 
on cars equipped with anti-lock brakes. 
</P>
<P>
 Tiny problems, and neither threatened the safety of vehicle nor occupants. 
Nobody cried "Pinto." And both recalls were enacted by Chrysler as 
precautionary moves. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, a recall is a recall and a messy business building buyer heartburn and 
media speculation that maybe Neon isn't the car to replace Saturn as the 
darling of America's economy-car motorists. 
</P>
<P>
 Strangely, where the capable Neon really glows has been only marginally 
advertised. The engine for all models is a 2.0-liter, 132-horsepower 
firecracker more powerful than anything from Ford, Toyota, Mazda, Subaru, 
Mitsubishi and others in the subcompact business. 
</P>
<P>
 It will dissolve even the most stubborn belief that subcompacts are 
underpowered, underbuilt and usually under GM. 
</P>
<P>
 And the marriage of Neon's responsive, gutsy four-banger with manual or 
automatic transmissions, multi-link suspension and stiffer chassis sets a new 
standard of engineering and assembly. 
</P>
<P>
 The cab-forward design -- pushing wheels into the corners of a vehicle to 
increase interior space -- that Chrysler has used effectively on its New Yorker 
and Vision-Concorde-Intrepid series, transforms Neon into a subcompact with 
compact room. 
</P>
<P>
 This also is the most economical economy car since the days when that meant 
driving something with three wheels. Fuel consumption is between 15% and 20% 
better than Plymouth Colt, Subaru Impreza and Ford Escort. Even several sips 
better than Saturn. 
</P>
<P>
 Neon gets 29 m.p.g. in town and a genuine 38 m.p.g. on the highway. That drops 
the petrol bill for the typical Angeleno's average daily commute of 20 miles to 
about 75 cents. 
</P>
<P>
 So in fine focus, hacking through all the hyperbole, see Neon as a spirited, 
capable car with a large amount of living room on a relatively long wheelbase 
only two inches shorter than Ford Taurus. It also is thoughtfully designed 
transportation that offers optimums of comfort, performance, safety and a 
modicum of stylishness for minimums of price and monthly maintenance. 
</P>
<P>
 That makes Neon just about the perfect vehicle for errant offspring, fleet 
purchasers, first-time buyers, two-car families and anyone sweltering beneath 
three mortgages. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite subtleties hallmarking the cab-forward silhouette -- a higher, rounded 
rear passenger compartment and sharply raked windshield -- Neon's looks are 
uninspired. The trunk is squared off, the front end shaved low, and that's 
uncomfortably close to Hyundai's Elantra, even the Korean-built Kia Sephia 
that's almost ready for market and slowly slithering into our sights. 
</P>
<P>
 For the consumer challenge, for the investment in its new positivism, Chrysler 
could have tried a little harder with a touch of chrome or a little less 
body-colored molding. And the choice of wheel covers, all grapefruit bulges 
with color-contrasting inserts by Fisher-Price toys, is a touch that reduces 
inexpensive and acceptable to cheap and nasty. 
</P>
<P>
 So do the plastic decals front and back for the Dodge, Plymouth and Neon 
logos. How much would chrome badges cost wholesale? Eight bits apiece? 
</P>
<P>
 The Neon Sport -- with its visually lightening touches of fog lights, vaned 
wheels and contrasting molding -- is much closer to ideal. But that will 
require a $14,000 visit to your credit union. 
</P>
<P>
 Neon's interior has comfortable, supportive bucket seats and plenty of head, 
leg, hip and wriggling room front and back. The upholstery, however, is 
ghastly. Ours was gray with pink and green flecks, like sprinkles on a 
Christmas cookie. 
</P>
<P>
 The back seat cushions are twin inserts folding down and flat for full or 
partial access to the trunk. They also form a temporary, fuzzy, level surface 
for whatever needs occur in a back seat. Such as changing baby's diaper or 
spreading out your FEMA forms. 
</P>
<P>
 Instruments are basic -- from left: temperature, fuel, speedometer, tachometer 
-- clustered in a single cowl. All controls are visible and reachable. During 
the day. At night, telling air direction and temperature knobs apart is 
impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 We also tried figuring out why one fan switch turns in opposing directions for 
hot or cold. We gave up on the seventh day. And fitting the key into the 
ignition is a constant fumble and wince. 
</P>
<P>
 Life and soul of this rascal, however, is performance. The lusty, 
bantam-weight engine -- soon to be puffed into a 150-horsepower version and 
dropped into the Neon Sport -- does everything well: accelerate, run hard with 
the wind, and do either with a growling rumble that once more spits in the eye 
of the subcompact genre. 
</P>

 The manual shift was superb with just enough grab for feeling gears, yet 
smooth enough for swift changes. Steering did exactly as it was told, stayed 
there, and brought the front-driving wheels back in line the second it was 
time.

CURVES AHEAD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Curves are cool. Right angles are square. 
</P>
<P>
 Look, and you'll see a world going round. Automobiles, appliances, 
electronics, furniture and housewares with undulating lines and soft shapes 
have been replacing the sharp-cornered designs of recent years. 
</P>
<P>
 Shoe box-shaped only a decade ago, cars have become roly-poly jelly beans 
(Toyota Previa) and muscle-bulging beasts (Dodge Viper). Boom boxes, once as 
solidly rectangular as a brick, look like knackwurst. Remote controls with all 
the grace of a 3-by-5 card have been transformed into palm-sized ovoids. And 
overstuffed couches -- slipcovered in antique fruit-print dish towels -- are 
far more fashionable than sleek, black leather sofas. 
</P>
<P>
 This new generation of curvy products is popular with consumers, who find the 
look sophisticated yet comforting, designers say. A soft edge is more 
humanistic than a hard one. "People want friendlier products," explains Martin 
Smith, chairman of product and industrial design at the Art Center College of 
Design in Pasadena. 
</P>
<P>
 But what really drives the curves is economics. Curvilinear shapes look new, 
and new shapes sell old products. Computer-aided design makes sinuous shapes 
easy to conceive and affords a more intricate end product. And because these 
curvy shapes require complicated tooling, manufacturers have fewer problems 
with cheap imitations flooding the market, says Herbert Tyrnauer, chairman of 
design department at Cal State Long Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Although designers' infatuation with curves has been cresting for several 
years, it shows no signs of slacking off. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most product design periods run four to five years," says Tim Brown, director 
of the San Francisco branch of IDEO, an international product and industrial 
design firm. "Whenever it is just a design trend, it will reach a high point 
and fade away. If there is a sound reason for the trend, it can last longer."  
</P>
<P>
 Several products with soft edges have already found their way into product 
Valhalla, the Museum of Modern Art in New York. The Photura camera from Canon, 
a 1989 entry, has been chosen for the museum's permanent collection. So has a 
computer pointing device, or mouse, designed last year by Steven Kaneko for 
Microsoft. While most pointers are shaped like cigarette packs, the Microsoft 
mouse is rodent-like. 
</P>
<P>
 Even in the design schools, where students' imaginations are unfettered by 
such pesky details as budgets, hypothetical products are getting the treatment. 
</P>
<P>
 Darrek Rosen, a student at the Art Center, recently conceived a round camera 
with the heaviest parts under the lens, in the area grasped by the hand. His 
easy-to-hold design reduces the chances of a fuzzy picture or an accidental 
drop and makes a smooth switch from vertical to horizontal. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts cite another camera, the 1985-issue T90 instamatic by Canon, and the 
Mazda Miata, out in 1989, as the forerunners of the change of form. Where other 
cameras and cars were sharply square, these were sensuously bulbous. 
</P>
<P>
 "Japan is where it all got started," Brown says. "It started off in automotive 
design, and was clearly obvious in Japanese consumer electronic products." 
</P>
<P>
 In the past, products were shaped by their internal mechanics. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the '40s and '50s, most products were mechanical. In the '60s and '70s, 
they were electrical and mechanical. The '80s and '90s saw things become 
digital. . . . The mechanical nature no longer dictates the shape," Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
 The digital electronics that run answering machines, coffee makers and 
portable telephones also aid the manufacturing process. Because product parts 
no longer have to fit a universal standard, companies can produce novelty 
designs in small quantities without going broke. 
</P>
<P>
 The low start-up costs and quick turnaround of computer-aided design and 
computer-aided manufacturing open the door for bright colors and unusual sizes, 
shapes and hybrid combinations. A telephone, for example, could take the form 
of a hot-pink plastic high-heel pump or a curvaceous compact desktop 
fax/answering machine/telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 Where digital technology liberated designers, CAD/CAM freed manufacturers. 
They can now indulge in making secondary products to advertise their primary 
wares. 
</P>
<P>
 Go Video, a Scottsdale, Ariz., electronics firm, recently introduced a 
dual-deck VCR system -- a model that could copy videotapes. But the 
accompanying remote control was too complicated.  
</P>
<P>
 "We needed something simple," says Ed Brachocki, vice president of marketing 
for the company, "something that would work with our VCR, have a broad 
application and would appeal to the mass market."  
</P>
<P>
 Translation: An inexpensive remote for the channel surfer -- one with an 
on-off control, volume regulator and channel changer -- that would work with 
the Go system and others. This product would put the name of the new company in 
many hands. 
</P>
<P>
 The company contacted Doug Patton, an Irvine-based industrial/product/software 
designer who had created a pen-shaped remote for Mitsubishi. He considered more 
than 50 designs, looking at every possible shape.  
</P>
<P>
 "When I design, I think about the design 24 hours a day. Everything I look at 
it has possibilities. It's a design tool called forced linking. 
</P>
<P>
 "One day when I went surfing, I was sitting on the beach picking up ocean 
rocks and skipping them. I thought, 'Hey, this shape feels good.' I took a 
bunch of the rounded rocks and started sketching." The result was a palm-sized 
remote control that resembles a flattened egg. 
</P>
<P>
 Louie Jones also breaks the box at every opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's rare that you ever see anything with a straight line in my collection," 
says the Laguna Beach furniture designer, who sells his work through 
Archipelago in Los Angeles. His $4,000 chest of drawers is like a flame, a 
bright, red, twisting teardrop that flicks the ceiling. A one-of-a-kind, 
eight-foot-tall birch highboy resembles more a viola than a piece of furniture. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is something sexy about curves. Adding curves to pieces gives them a 
life form," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 If nothing else, the shape of a product should make the user feel good, or the 
shape should feel good as it is being used. Evoking the warm-fuzzies is now 
part of the design criterion, designers say. 
</P>
<P>
 "When the form is set free, products can have a sense of emotional content," 
Smith says. 
</P>
<P>
 This is where the new and useful will stand out from the merely clever. Over 
the long haul, the practical and easy-to-use products, no matter what their 
shape, will outlast gimmicky ones, such as shoe-shaped phones.  
</P>
<P>
 "Design has moved beyond just designing tools for functionality," Brown says. 
"Tools are about experience. They have to give value to our lives. People don't 
change much from decade to decade. Products that connect to people last longer 
than ones that are merely a design trend."

BIG TIME; TALK ABOUT DIALING FOR DOLLARS. WHEN A WRISTWATCH PUTS ITS BEST FACE

SWEEPING STATEMENT IN A SECOND. TICK FOR TOCK, IT'S STATUS TO BEAT THE BAND.

 Wristwatches not only tell time, they speak volumes about the wearer's 
personality, tastes and cash flow. There are sporty watches that do almost 
everything but take one's blood pressure, avant-garde watches with minimalist 
faces for art lovers, prestige watches for corporate conservatives and flashy 
jeweled watches for those who like to show their wealth on their wrist. There's 
a watch for every fetish, from gambling to golf. Meeting with your bridge 
buddies? Impress them with a watch adorned with playing cards on its face. Love 
animals? There are cow watches, cat watches, dog watches and various other 
nature watches. Feeling holier-than-thou? Strap on a watch with a dial that 
bears a religious symbol. Such styles are among the more than 150 fashion 
watches at Keeping Time in Brea Mall. The store specializes in low-price 
watches that revolve around holidays, hobbies and professions. 
</P>
<P>
 "These watches are for people who just want to have fun and not spend a lot of 
money," says John Chu, owner of Keeping Time. "They're what Seiko would never 
do." 
</P>
<P>
 Music lovers can find a watch with a tiny bow and violin for hands. 
Cat-fanciers can sport a watch with a cat and mouse that run around the dial. 
Barbers and beauticians favor the watch with Edward Scissorhands. There's even 
a watch for watch collectors; its second hand looks like a tiny wristwatch. 
</P>
<P>
 Dinosaurs, playing cards, fish, golfers, hunters, cartoon characters, a 
miniature Van Gogh, seasonal themes such as Christmas and Valentine's Day -- 
all can be found on a watch face. These fun watches don't pretend to take the 
place of fine watches. Rather, at $15 to $30 each, they're designed to round 
out one's watch wardrobe. 
</P>
<P>
 For those with bigger budgets, wearing a prestigious, higher-end watch is 
still the way to say, "I've arrived." 
</P>
<P>
 "A watch is a sort of power play," says Robert Penner, owner of the Watch 
Connection in Costa Mesa. "If a guy comes in wearing a $1,200 suit with a $30 
watch, it looks stupid. He might as well wear a dirty shirt." 
</P>
<P>
 Penner's choice for the businessman who wants to impress a client: a cutting 
edge $1,300 Philippe Charriol with an 18-karat gold bezel and band made of 
stainless steel cables -- the same kind found on aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are starting to recognize the importance of what they wear on their 
wrist," says Anthony D'Ambrosio, executive director of Tourneau, a retailer of 
fine Swiss watches in South Coast Plaza, Costa Mesa. They "realize a watch 
tells as much about them as their clothes or automobile. Even more importantly, 
it's something they wear every day, all day long." 
</P>
<P>
 Rolex and Cartier are still kings of the status watches, Ambrosio says. While 
their names might not be as familiar to some, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet 
and Vacheron Constantin are also among the leading prestige watch 
manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
 There's almost no limit to what one can spend on a watch. One Piaget watch 
available through Tourneau comes in solid emerald-cut diamonds and costs a cool 
$1 million. Rolexes vary in price depending on the amount of gold and number of 
diamonds. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can spend anything you want to on these guys," says Gary Elias, manager 
of Tourneau. The basic 18-karat gold men's Rolex is $13,900. 
</P>
<P>
 Some styles are geared for watch collectors who have as much appreciation for 
a watch's insides as its glamorous exterior. 
</P>
<P>
 Tourneau has a perpetual calendar minute repeater by Vacheron Constantin made 
of platinum ($355,000) that is "the epitome of the watchmaker's art and craft," 
D'Ambrosio says. 
</P>
<P>
 The handcrafted mechanism not only tells the date, it knows which months have 
30 or 31 days and even which year is a leap year. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's actually a wheel inside that turns once every four years," D'Ambrosio 
says. In place of an hour hand, a small window offers a numerical display of 
the hour, and there's even a tiny chime to announce the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "A watch like this is purchased by collectors, CEOs and celebrities -- people 
who enjoy owning items that are rare," D'Ambrosio says. 
</P>
<P>
 Those with more unconventional tastes prefer the funky, sporty watches of 
Alain Silberstein. His watches are known for the bright colors and unusual 
geometric shapes of their hands, dials and pushpins. Silberstein's 
chronographs, which double as stop-watches, range from about $1,800 to $19,000 
at Tourneau. 
</P>
<P>
 Art connoisseurs favor the sophisticated sterling watches designed by New York 
City artist Lisa Jenks, available for about $600 at Sunwatch in Fashion Island 
Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're museum quality. They have no numbers on the dial. The look is real 
clean," says Robert Zinda, owner of Sunwatch. "They're for the art shopper." 
</P>
<P>
 Some people like the subtle Southwest influence seen on the sterling watches 
by Ecclissi of Santa Fe, N.M. Ecclissi's watches have clean, uncluttered dials 
and unusual bands, one with a leather rope inlaid with sterling and another 
with a sterling rope bracelet, gold bezel and black dial ($250 to $425). 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the '90s. Everything's toned down. The looks are simple," Zinda says.

 While everyone else was showing off the top of their skivvies over their 
pants, Cari Frankson turned a pair of men's briefs into a tank top for an ad 
for a jeans company. Faster than you can say "Calvin Klein," demand turned the 
Burbank-based stylist into a fashion designer. She buys new men's CK undies at 
retail and resells the altered piece in stores such as Judys and Fred Segal's 
for about $27 under her Wild Cherry label. "BVD and Jockey just don't have the 
same cachet," she says. And Mr. Klein sanctions her work. Her line now includes 
a dozen original items along the underwear-as-outerwear theme. Postcards From 
the Edge 
</P>
<P>
 For several seasons now, Pendleton has penned its prints inspired by the 
beauty of America. The spotlight this spring is on Maui, with shirts covered in 
postcards and signs of sights along the road to Hana -- including a mug of a 
young George Harrison. The former Beatle lives at the end of the treacherous 
road. The shirt (short-sleeved, $44; long, $52) is already a hit, says 
spokesman Peter Bishop. "It got caught in the current Hawaiian shirt craze." A 
Spring in Your Step 
</P>
<P>
 That heavy clunker of a boot ain't doing you right for spring? But you don't 
want to lose the solid lug soles for some dinky shoe? Vans tones it down with 
its Mary Janes. "There's been a heavy, bulky look for some time, but for girls 
there's a need for something slightly more feminine," says Sari Ratsula, head 
of design at the Orange-based sneaker maker. "This is two looks in one." It's 
available in natural, midnight blue and a combination stripe for about $44. A 
Welcome Alternative 
</P>
<P>
 While there seems to be some unwritten rule that alternative clothing stores 
need to look like urban nightmares (chain-link fencing is a popular interior 
fixture), Pat Tenore and Vince Abel, both 20, grew tired of the look with their 
One 40 Five store in Costa Mesa. At a new location in that city, now near Rock 
N Java and Tower Records, the duo has gone minimalistic with gorgeous blond 
birch displays and uncluttered merchandising. "We just want to present a good 
vibe," Tenore says. Hipsters can find "non-corporate clothing" such as 24-7, 
X-Large, Junkies, Betsey Johnson and 555 Soul. ROSE APODACA

INSIDE OUT / NOTES FROM THE STYLE FRONT: HOW MR. B OUT CHICS THE TRES CHIC

<P>
 Bravo, Mr. Blackwell. All the tres handsome, tres chic Frenchmen at the Yves 
Saint Laurent party Monday night couldn't compete with your . . . presence. 
Whatever possessed you to drape that mink car coat so saucily off your 
shoulders? Or smoke a cigarette, Bette Davis-style, in a holder? 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to run up to him and say, 'Do you know you're wearing a dead 
animal?' " sputtered an outraged guest. But of course, she didn't -- because, 
well, Mr. B just might have responded with a cruel crack about her ensemble. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Saint Laurent's delicious, Fruit Loop-colored spring menswear -- 
orange-orange jackets, lemon-yellow gingham check suits and blue-blue tapestry 
pants -- was paraded before an audience that included butler-turned-millionaire 
Bernard Lafferty. The pony-tailed heir to the Doris Duke fortune arrived at the 
Rodeo Drive store with an entourage that included an attractive Swedish woman 
and a personal bodyguard. "He's a customer," we were told. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's finale -- an embroidered Levi's jacket emblazoned with a sunflower 
and the words "Love 1994" -- will go to the highest bidder June 18 at the DIFFA 
(Design Industries Foundation for AIDS) auction at the Century Plaza Hotel. By 
the close of Monday's party, $1,200 had already been pledged. Do we hear 
$12,000, Mr. Lafferty? It Is Fun to Have Fun, but You Have to Know How 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement Wednesday that San Francisco-based Esprit clothing company 
will make shoes, clothing and accessories decorated with Dr. Seuss characters 
didn't surprise us a bit. We'd noticed a weird nostalgia for Dr. Seuss in our 
own Gen-X offspring and among those not of our womb. Like the young man who 
lovingly read "Green Eggs and Ham" to his sweetheart in the children's section 
at Brentano's late one Saturday night. That Sam I Am, That Sam I Am, I Do Not 
Like That Sam I Am . . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Seuss: the Kahlil Gibran of the '90s. 
</P>
<P>
 And wasn't it just a year or so ago that "Cat in the Hat" hats were the rage 
at all-night raves? Esprit has clearly tapped into a deep wellspring of 
post-adolescent kinship with the subversive creatures that populate the 
Seussian landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Uh, not really. 
</P>
<P>
 "Character-driven apparel has become a vital part of the business as evidenced 
by the sales of Warner Brothers and Disney," said Andy Cohen, president of 
Esprit Apparel. "We believe this licensing agreement is a great opportunity to 
expand our business." 
</P>
<P>
 So much for social theory. Duncan Lines Speaking of character-driven apparel, 
actress and Wheat Thins enthusiast Sandy Duncan will sell her own line of 
fashions for petite women starting March 17 on the Home Shopping Network. 
Duncan is particularly fond, she says, of a jumpsuit in soft crepe rayon 
available in black or peach -- just $69.95. "The waist hits just where it 
should and it doesn't pull through the torso," she said. Cinema Paradiso As 
usual, Giorgio Armani's show of fall clothing Wednesday in Milan was one part 
high fashion, one part Hollywood. Robert De Niro flew in from London. Actress 
Jeanne Tripplehorn made the trip from the States with fiance Ben Stiller 
("Reality Bites"). Sophia Loren came all the way from Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Armani's show and post-show dinner party marked the designer's 20th 
anniversary in the business, and the event was celebrated accordingly: All 500 
seats in the designer's fashion theater were re-covered in red velvet, and his 
Peter Marino-designed apartment was swathed in Moroccan fabric for the night.  
</P>
<P>
 That's kind of the effect we were going for when we Super Glued our beloved 
leopard-print chiffon scarf to an old lampshade. Portrait of the Artist With a 
Four-in-Hand Ties and scarves silk-screened with images from Picasso paintings 
are proving to be as popular as the exhibit -- "Picasso and the Weeping Women" 
-- that spawned them. As a rule, says a spokeswoman for the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Art, the museum gift shop doesn't carry clothing. But the $35 ties 
and $55 scarves have been so coveted by visitors to the popular exhibition that 
perhaps a new tradition may be born. Fashion Perpetrators London isn't talking 
about fashion victims anymore -- they're more interested in fashion criminals. 
Or at least the new denim collection that inmates of Full Sutton prison near 
York launched last week. The Keyhole Clothing Project is being backed by the 
Red or Dead clothing line, whose founders were impressed by the workmanship of 
the women's jeans, jackets and skirts made in denim. Profits from the line, 
made entirely by the prison staff and inmates, will go directly back to the 
project. Red or Dead has plans to take the collection to Paris, New York and 
Los Angeles.

THE FALL COLLECTIONS / MILAN; LAYERING IT ON; COMBOS OF JACKETS OVER (TUNICS 
AND DRESSES) AND UNDER (TOPCOATS) TAKE TO THE RUNWAY

 Even Giorgio Armani seems flummoxed by the season. The Italian master of cool 
restraint put on a show Wednesday night that left one wondering whether he saw 
women as men, with hair greased flat against their heads, or as goddesses whose 
beaded gowns appeared too imposing for anything more than a polite handshake. 
</P>
<P>
 How strange too for Armani to dwell on layers of jackets and tunics when last 
season he made his clothes look so light they might well have been weightless. 
Now, for fall, he seems hung up on the disproportion of a longer blouse or 
tunic under a jacket, which looked cumbersome when the tunic was the length of 
a skirt and the model had on pants. It came as a relief, then, when another 
model appeared in a gray bird's-eye tweed jacket over a fluted short dress in 
semi-transparent gray jersey. At least she did not have to bear the extra meter 
of inconvenience. 
</P>
<P>
 The pleasure of watching an Armani show is seeing how he solves problems by 
the shortest route possible. But in this collection, he seemed to create more 
obstacles than he eliminated. If showing tunic-like dresses softens wardrobes 
thick with jackets, why add heavy leggings with built-in boots? Likewise, there 
are only so many ways in which the jacket can be reinvented, but if one of the 
tenets of modern dressing is deconstruction, why then add rippling lapels to a 
jacket that otherwise looked as unstructured as a cardigan? 
</P>
<P>
 So it was hard to get a handle on this collection. There were plenty of 
jackets in fabrics with textures that ranged from waffle to herringbone, 
chenille to plush, and some very fine separates, including loose crepe blouses 
with open collars and taut T-shirts made of what appeared to be sheer wool. But 
the prints (vaguely ethnic) looked passe, and the color register barely got 
above dusty pinks and blues. In a season crying out for color, even a single 
spot of red would have helped to clarify all the beige. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the evening clothes, there was hardly a gown or pants ensemble that 
didn't have a clacking swish of beads. It's hard to believe that such dresses, 
if they ever get produced, will make a woman feel that she is more than just a 
pretty object on a pedestal. 
</P>
<P>
 At Fendi, nothing was quite as it seemed. Karl Lagerfeld sent out a torrent of 
coats and practically defied his audience to tell which were made of wool, 
suede, fur or fake fur. Some were actually double coats with an interior of fur 
and a removable outer shell of opaque nylon that looked like a protective bag. 
Many were traversed with mohair or Angora cross-stitching, giving the coats a 
kind of primitive feel, as though they had been stitched together in the caves 
of various Ugs and Ergs. 
</P>
<P>
 For some time now, Lagerfeld has been treating fur as an anti-status object, 
even to the point of slicing pelts with holes or, this season, piercing them 
with rings and letting the sleeves hang down below the fingertips, the way 
fashion people do with their shirt cuffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The attitude for fall is less destructive, and the furs (mink, sable, mole and 
weasel) drape and lap around the body with the same insouciance as an old 
flannel shirt with a sweater tied around the waist. The difference, of course, 
is incomparable technique, and for that Lagerfeld has the excellent Fendi 
workrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Occasionally you get some sense of the inanity of fashion in the face of 
Sarajevo and Hebron when designers try to turn a runway into a world peace 
summit. The Complice show Wednesday added up to a U.N. stockpile of Red Army 
coats, subcontinental saris, Nordic knits and Third World fake fur. This was 
Domenico Dolce and Stefano Gabbana mimicking Jean Paul Gaultier and Martin 
Margiela, but with the commercial mentality of a Benetton store. 
</P>
<P>
 So you got navy blazers finished off with a maxi-length of tartan, orange down 
jackets over transparent black dresses, velvet track pants with sneakers, and 
distressed leather jeans with unfinished shearling coats. Item by item, many of 
the pieces worked; the rusted effect of the leathers and the surplus style of 
the army coats were at least thoughtful. But the rest didn't require any more 
insight than what can be gleaned on a morning at the flea market. 
</P>
<P>
 The object of Gianni Versace's desire on Tuesday evening seemed to be 
schoolyard, with its egg-cream colors played out on fabrics with that E-Z Kleen 
shine. There was, to be sure, something rather kinky about violet and pink 
empire dresses that looked as though they had been recently hosed down. And the 
sight of Helena Christensen in nothing but a shiny-black bibbed overall skirt 
made one wonder if maybe she weren't working the wrong street. 
</P>
<P>
 But, clearly, Versace was in his element, and while the clothes may have 
looked as slippery as a biker bar, the message was an unvarnished statement 
about women. Behind the plastic-coated skirts and leggings, the silver bomber 
jackets and collegiate turtlenecks sparkling with Lurex, there was the shape of 
fashion to come.  
</P>
<P>
 Lagerfeld set the course last fall with his spare schoolgirl suits and 
paint-box colors, and now Versace has applied his own formula of frank sex 
appeal to this essentially innocent look. By next year, when the glamour pusses 
cross their legs in the lobby of the Four Seasons, they'll be encased in mint 
green and gunmetal. 
</P>
<P>
 By comparison, Jil Sander's Tuesday show amounted to a whisper in dark. The 
German designer took refuge in the somber clothes for which she is known -- the 
streamlined pantsuits, fluid overcoats and spare skirts that for fall will come 
in hues of cocoa, charcoal and berry-brown. A year ago, she had succeeded in 
whittling down her clothes to a bare minimum of construction; now, in 
double-faced wool and knit jersey, they looked positively cut to the bone. 
</P>
<P>
 There was also something redundant about the collection, and it may be that 
other designers have simply caught on to her small-shouldered jackets, her lean 
lines and the cool frankness of her monochromatic palette.  
</P>
<P>
 What looked new, apart from the gored double-faced wool suits, were coats and 
pantsuits in black velveteen. A zippered stadium parka opened over a simple 
black georgette dress, setting up a more subdued contrast between two matte 
surfaces. The designer tried to make a similar play with gowns made of vertical 
or asymmetrical pieces of chiffon and georgette, but these peek-a-boo effects 
seem to have played out. 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, a passage of ivory mohair knits left no impression other than that 
they might be irritating. Perhaps, in the end, what was missing from this show 
was the element of surprise: a burst of color, a treasured vest, a little 
something to give these clothes juice.

FAUX PAS REPORT: STICK OUT YOUR NECK OR RISK GETTING COLLARED BY MAKEUP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN MORELL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The way some women wear cosmetics, you'd think there was a 6.8 earthquake 
every morning. How else would you explain all the makeup stains covering their 
turtlenecks and high-necked blouses? 
</P>
<P>
 "There are special shields available in some stores that you zip over your 
face. They allow you to put a pullover sweater or blouse on without destroying 
your makeup," says Sandy Miller of Twice the Style in Costa Mesa. "But you 
could also just use an old scarf." 
</P>
<P>
 Those who pull the sweater on before applying base can tuck some tissues 
around the collar. When done, pull them carefully away from the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Lobe blows: It wasn't much more than a decade ago that macho guys began 
venturing out with a simple gold stud embedded in one lobe. The more 
adventurous started using diamonds (or the look-a-like cubic zirconia) and 
began adding more than one puncture to the outer edge of their ears.  
</P>
<P>
 Now, some desperate to reach the cutting edge of ear wear are punching their 
lobes with dangling chains of gold and silver. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chains or other hanging earrings are definitely an acquired taste for guys," 
says clothing designer Brian Mayne of Mission Viejo. "You wear them to 
nightclubs and parties, except when you know the president of your company will 
be present." 
</P>
<P>
 Unless you're going for the complete Melrose look, stick to dangling earrings 
no longer than 1 1/2 inches. Don't make the mistake of using a woman's hangers; 
their earrings are just plain different. 
</P>
<P>
 Animal magnetism: Like an endangered species that makes a comeback, those 
purposely tacky animal prints may be back again this spring and summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm seeing more women with the zebra-patterned skirts and leopard blouses," 
says fashion buyer Ellen Corcoran of Yorba Linda. "These will continue to be a 
quirky trend, but don't make the mistake of wearing two different prints 
together." 
</P>
<P>
 Tan, white or black are good, neutral coordinating colors for a leopard, tiger 
or zebra fabric. Make sure that what you're wearing with animal is plain and 
simple, and please, don't mix the species.

STYLE FILE: ABRACADABRA! A LONG, LEAN LOOK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET KINOSIAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Most women will admit that they have less than perfect legs. Their challenge, 
then, is to give the best possible illusion of length and slimness to their 
sometimes shapeless, stubby or thick lower limbs. The good news is that they 
can do just that -- with a little fashion illusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in the United States seem to worship the illusion of thin and tall," 
says Marcia Yust, a fashion coordinator who lives in Tustin. "And your legs are 
an important part of that. You can follow some basic rules to help give a slim 
illusion to your leg." 
</P>
<P>
 Here are some fashion guidelines Yust says will camouflage leg flaws and play 
up assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Thick Thighs / Hip 
</P>
<P>
 Characteristics: Heavy, wide thighs. Also large saddle-bags and heavy girth in 
hip. 
</P>
<P>
 Best look: Wear skirts that flare from the waist to cover the upper hip. To 
elongate the look of the legs, wear skirts that stop just above the ankle; if 
you have nice calves and ankles, wear skirts that stop below the knee or at 
mid-calf. Wear stockings and shoes that are the same color as the outfit. Shoes 
should be mid or high heel. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid: Tight pants (if you need pants, wear loose, pleated, tailored ones that 
fall over hip and thigh). Don't wear leggings with short tops, straight skirts, 
see-through skirts or dresses with leggings. Avoid flat shoes or thick boots 
that draw attention downward. 
</P>
<P>
 Thick Calf / Thin Ankle 
</P>
<P>
 Characteristics: Thick, heavy calf, either due to being overly muscular or 
overweight. 
</P>
<P>
 Best look: Flared or dirndl skirts or culottes in jersey, light wool, silk or 
cotton. A straight skirt can be worn but with a small slit in back (if thighs 
are thin, a long column dress works). Skirt should cover calf. Wear stockings 
that are thick rather than sheer. Shoes, the same color as the stockings, can 
be low, mid or high heel. Granny boots can be worn if the calf is covered. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid: Ankle strap and the tennis shoe or combat boot look. 
</P>
<P>
 Thick Calf / Thick Ankle 
</P>
<P>
 Best look: Flared skirts that fall mid-calf or just above ankle. Flowing 
fabrics -- light wool, jersey, silk and cotton -- are best. Dirndl culottes or 
gaucho pants with boots are a good alternative. Shoes should be mid- to 
high-heel; a narrow high heel looks best. Open-toe shoes are good choices. Wear 
boots one size larger than your normal shoe size so they will be loose over 
your calf. Wear the same color non-sheer stockings and shoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid: Flat shoes, mules, heavy combat and granny boots. (Granny boots can be 
worn with a long, full skirt.) Don't wear ankle straps or thick heels. Avoid 
tight leggings with short or long sweaters, dresses above the knee and short 
shorts. Even if you have a nice upper leg, avoid slits or open skirts that draw 
attention to the legs. Don't mix stocking and shoe color. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Thin Leg 
</P>
<P>
 Best look: Can wear almost anything. Skirts can be tight, slit or side-slit 
for a risque yet refined look. Length can be from a mini-skirt to just below 
the knee. Pants can be straight or full. Leggings work well with open skirts. 
You can wear flat, mid, high or chunky heels; boots; ankle strap or tie shoes. 
Ankle or mid-calf granny boots can be worn with long or short skirts. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid: Mini-skirts should be reserved for young women. A skirt that ends just 
above the knee is as high as other women should go, even if they have great 
legs. 
</P>
<P>
 Skinny Legs 
</P>
<P>
 If the thinness of your legs bothers you, wear skirts that end at mid-calf or 
just above the ankle. Or try the layered look with leggings or opaque stockings 
with slips, sheer skirts or column dresses. Boots provide good camouflage. 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid: Mini-skirts, sheer stockings and ankle-strap shoes. JANET KINOSIAN

HER HAIRNESS; VIVIENNE MACKINDER IS THE QUEEN OF THE AVANT-GARDE LOCKS. AMONG 
HER LOOKS: BABY DOLL, GODDESS, STREET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EMILY ADAMS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It's minutes till show time and Vivienne Mackinder is sweating over a couple 
of hairs. Quite literally. 
</P>
<P>
 A tiny bead of perspiration gathers on her hairline as she sprays, tucks and 
yanks a model's swept-back style into submission. Two hairs that belong in a 
turned-under ponytail keep springing out like stiffly calcified spears. 
</P>
<P>
 But Mackinder never loses her cool. She chats up her models, murmuring in a 
soothing British accent: "Simply chic, my darling." 
</P>
<P>
 And then, with her models corralled and ready to take the stage at the recent 
international hair show in Long Beach, Mackinder flashes her best smile and 
wipes her brow with back of a wrist. 
</P>
<P>
 "Oh, I don't take it seriously," she says. "Fashion is a game." 
</P>
<P>
 She might not take it seriously, but in the rarefied world of trend-makers, 
Mackinder and her work have been creating a stir. 
</P>
<P>
 She has won the North American Hairdressing Award's prize for Most Avant Garde 
stylist four times, most recently in 1993. Yet Mackinder is a hairstylist 
without a salon, a product line or an infomercial to her name. Stranger still, 
she has moved her home base in England to Pittsburgh, where her husband works. 
</P>
<P>
 After working for Vidal Sassoon in London in the late 1970s, she created her 
own company, offering seminars to beauticians the world over. She also works as 
a hired gun for photographers on fashion layouts, and last month published 
"Montage," a book expounding upon her styling ideas for those face-framing 
follicles. 
</P>
<P>
 What Mackinder does, she says, is open to interpretation -- your local 
beautician is not likely to inflict her avant-garde ideas on your head. But 
Mackinder's concepts do trickle into the mainstream, so you might see a 
variation on her punkish razor cut around town, but without the purple-fountain 
hairpiece attachment. 
</P>
<P>
 She likes hairpieces -- called "falls" in an earlier generation -- which she 
creates by hand. Hair, she says, is a living art form. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to interpret women in different ways, because we're so many different 
things, you know," she says. "We're certainly not alike." 
</P>
<P>
 Among Mackinder's current interpretations of " 'in' looks" for different types 
of women: 
</P>
<P>
 * Street, subtitled pretty and punk. For this look, she takes a raven-haired 
model with a brutishly short razor cut and applies a purple and black font of 
up-sticking hair to the top of her head. It's like a small, bright fountain of 
color. 
</P>
<P>
 * Monastic, for women who prefer clothing in neutral shades and long, sleek 
hair. They occasionally employ headbands. Yes, headbands like the hippies wore 
-- only Mackinder makes them of hair.  
</P>
<P>
 * Clean and classic, subtitled "Grace Kelly in the '90s." These hairstyles, 
which seem to follow the curve of a gracefully arched eyebrow, we admire from 
afar, but could never do at home.  
</P>
<P>
 * Goddess, with long, complicated, almost rococo curls in varying shades of 
gold, red and brown. 
</P>
<P>
 * Baby doll, or mostly fluffy hair to go with the naive-yet-blatantly sexual 
look going around in some fashion circles. Some blast the trend as the remaking 
of women into powerless girls. But Mackinder just smiles and shakes her head at 
the suggestion of sociopolitical intent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look," she says, "you'll always have fashion victims. And then there are 
others who can interpret the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just hoping people can learn how to have fun."

RUNWAY TO REALITY: SLIP ONE OVER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOANNA DENDEL 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Look: The short slip dress is making a comeback -- this time over a 
sleeveless T-shirt. With spaghetti straps and above-the-knee hemline, it's a 
sure bet for the spring-summer wardrobes of cute young things with near-perfect 
bodies. 
</P>
<P>
 How to Do It Big: Who would have guessed that Ralph Lauren would design little 
slip dresses for his spring collection? He showed them in solids and tiny 
floral prints with Ts of varying sleeve lengths and thigh-high stockings. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his simplest versions of the look is a black jersey knit dress over a 
white, skinny-ribbed "muscle-man" model T. The dress may be skimpy, but the 
price isn't -- $335. The shirt is $20. Both are available in Beverly Hills at 
the Polo/Ralph Lauren boutique. 
</P>
<P>
 Total: $355 
</P>
<P>
 How to Do It Budget: The clever designers who make moderately priced clothing 
have pounced on the slip dress. 
</P>
<P>
 Francine Browner does one in black rayon knit for her Hearts line. The best 
thing about her Ralph Lauren look-alike is that it comes with a white 
cap-sleeved T-shirt. The set costs $59 at Windsor Fashions in the Westside 
Pavilion, Los Angeles. To duplicate the Lauren look, simply sub in a Hanes 
sleeveless T-shirt; a pack of three costs $7 at K mart stores citywide. 
</P>
<P>
 Total: $61.33 JOANNA DENDEL

THE ALL-AMERICAN SNEAKER GETS ON A HIGH-FASHION KICK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Sneakers, with the right mix of fit, function and fashion, are going the 
distance from locker room to ballroom with a stop en route for a special award. 
</P>
<P>
 "This felt like the year of the sneaker -- truly an American item whose 
influence has been felt worldwide," Fern Mallis, executive director of the 
Council of Fashion Designers of America, said after sneakers walked off with 
honors at the trade group's awards dinner in New York last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Adidas, Converse, Keds, Nike and Reebok were jointly named to accept the 1993 
CFDA special award for the sneaker's "uniquely American influence on world 
fashion." 
</P>
<P>
 Mallis said sneakers were the genesis for this year's growth in body-conscious 
clothing and active sportswear. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've become a part of everyone's life," she said, even for those not bent 
on being fit. "They're in all kinds of fabrics and colors, and you're seeing 
them with evening wear and in offices." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, sneakers were ubiquitous on spring runways, both in New York and 
Paris. Metallic silver tennis shoes were Donna Karan's favorite footwear for 
both silver sportswear and long matte jersey evening gowns. Richard Tyler, 
designing for Anne Klein Collection, concocted a rope-soled espadrille sneaker, 
and Norma Kamali came up with funky, boot-like high-top sneakers that laced to 
the knee. Chanel's standout was a white canvas high top with black tap toe, 
rubber lug sole, three-inch heel and $640 price tag. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's very '90s, a much more relaxed look," says Anne Fahey, public relations 
manager for Chanel in New York. "And it's a great way to update a classic 
Chanel suit." 
</P>
<P>
 While Chanel put its hallmark on a sneaker, other fashion designers borrowed 
the Adidas hallmark, the triple-track racing stripe. For spring, it appears on 
everything from active wear to formal wear from the likes of Isaac Mizrahi, 
Yves Saint Laurent, Rifat Ozbek and Anna Sui. 
</P>
<P>
 Just add Adidas Gazelles, those low-cut suede soccer-like shoes with the three 
diagonal stripes on each side. 
</P>
<P>
 "They've been discovered by a new generation, and we're selling three or four 
times as many now as in the mid-'70s," says Peter Moore, president of Adidas. 
The Portland company is reviving several old styles. 
</P>
<P>
 Joanna Jacobson, senior vice president of marketing for Converse in North 
Reading, Mass., agrees. "The biggest trend in the industry right now," she 
says, "is basic athletic footwear from the 1970s." 
</P>
<P>
 In November her company relaunched the 1974 One Star. At $50, it's a unisex, 
low-top tennis sneaker. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an understated shoe that merchandises very well," Jacobson says. "What's 
back in style is clean, simple, stripped-down. It has none of the bells and 
whistles of the high-tech '80s." 
</P>
<P>
 The first rubber-soled shoes were produced in the U.S. in the late 1800s, but 
Keds, in 1916, were the first with vulcanization, a permanent bond between 
canvas shoe tops and rubber soles. Converse followed in 1917 with its Chuck 
Taylor All Star sneaker. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until the fitness-fixated 1980s that sneakers made a name for 
themselves, says Joanna Jacobson, senior vice president of marketing for 
Converse. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that time, people wore sneakers as a performance statement for working 
out," she says, "but the comfort factor really propelled them beyond the 
workout." 
</P>
<P>
 Makers such as Reebok, Adidas, Asics, K-Swiss, Sacony and New Balance gave 
sneakers cachet, cool and class, while Nike, a $3.4 billion company promoted by 
Michael Jordan and Bo Jackson, exhorted a nation of consumers to "Just Do It." 
</P>
<P>
 Today, as fashion remains focused on fitness, sneaker manufacturers, including 
Britain's Reebok, are positioned to meet a need. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're responding to a younger generation that's making a fashion statement 
with lower-priced shoes that don't have so much technology," says John Morgan, 
Reebok's vice president and general manager for products in the United States.

BEHIND THE SCENES: A NATURAL REACTION AT THE CHANCE TO SEA AND BE SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was an artist's reception in which no one wore the obligatory black-out 
leather look. Instead, environmentalists who met with Wyland -- the marine-life 
painter known for his life-size "Whaling Walls" -- were dressed casually in 
natural fabrics that reflected the colors of the ocean scenes on canvas at the 
Dana Point Resort last Sunday afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 No leather, eel or other animal products, please. It wouldn't be appropriate 
to wear such things to an event that benefits the Wyland Foundation, which aims 
to protect ocean resources through public art and education. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the 500 visitors wore cotton shorts, earth-tone linen pants or 
well-worn jeans. Top-Siders and sandals were privy to the fete that honored the 
artist who painted his first whale mural in Laguna Beach in 1981 and has since 
created more than 50 others worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist, donned in denim, signed his name on T-shirts imprinted with his 
work. In keeping with the save-the-planet theme, the tees were made from 
recycled milk cartons. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyland's work is on display at the resort's Lantern Bay Lounge through Sunday.

WORKS AT RISK; COLLECTORS LOST SOME PRIZED PIECES IN THE QUAKE. MANY TOOK STEPS 
TO PREVENT DAMAGE. AND FEW SAY THE DISASTER WILL MAKE THEM ABANDON THEIR 
HOBBIES.

<P>
 First they heard the roar from the earth below, then the sound of glass 
breaking -- not just ordinary windows or even treasured family heirlooms, but 
art, contemporary glass sculptures that had been lovingly acquired over time to 
become part of significant art collections. 
</P>
<P>
 When the shaking stopped, art collectors in the San Fernando Valley waited 
anxiously for the sun to rise so they could see what was left of their 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Jan. 17 quake, one may question why anyone living in earthquake 
territory would want to be surrounded by delicate art objects. But once a 
collector, always a collector. 
</P>
<P>
 "Half the fun is in the hunt, the chase," says Dan Greenberg, who collects 
glass and other art objects with his wife, Susan Steinhauser. "We knew the 
price we'd pay for collecting this kind of material, that we'd have to suffer. 
The nature of glass puts it at risk, but the joy of living with the material -- 
you don't realize how much you enjoy it until it's not there." 
</P>
<P>
 Most collectors have faced the fact that they live with the risk of damage to 
their collections from natural and man-made events. They take reasonable 
precautions to prevent damage, but like most of us living in California who 
continually hear that the Big One is coming, art collectors just don't dwell on 
such impending doom. After all, how can you live if you're always standing by 
for a disaster?  
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg and Steinhauser's sizable collection is housed in their Westside 
home and his Van Nuys office. In the weeks since the quake, they and many 
Valley collectors have been taking stock of what they lost -- or what was 
spared. They have spent time mulling over which of their efforts to protect 
their art succeeded and which did not.  
</P>
<P>
 "It's remarkable how random the destruction was," Greenberg says. "Places 
where I thought we would lose everything, nothing broke." 
</P>
<P>
 As these collectors share their experiences and thoughts for the future, it 
becomes obvious that the philosophy behind art collecting has as many 
variations as there are artistic media. What might seem prudent to one 
collector after the quake -- to secure every piece of art to a solid, ideally 
immovable object -- is overkill to others. They'd rather live with the peril of 
losing artwork than not being able to pick it up and hold it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't like having anything permanent. I move art around all the time," says 
Carl Schlosberg, a private art dealer in Sherman Oaks who lost several 
sculptures and a 17th-Century glass collection in the quake. He is restoring 
his home, where every room needs some work, and outdoor sculpture garden, where 
he lost a few pieces -- and giving some attention to collecting art pieces that 
will endure earthquakes. "You have to use common sense when placing things," he 
says, but beyond that, he intends to continue to move his sculpture around. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenberg and Steinhauser had plexiglass guards installed in front of some 
shelves before the quake, which prevented many glass pieces from falling and 
breaking. But art objects on other shelves were not protected by a barrier, and 
most of them survived. Many were secured to the shelves with a sticky, soft wax 
sold as Quake Wax. "The pieces we lost weren't well balanced," Greenberg says. 
</P>
<P>
 He is considering putting two strands of fishing line across unprotected 
shelves. Fishing line would offer some flexibility while possibly preventing 
objects from falling, and it would be less intrusive to the eye than 
plexiglass. 
</P>
<P>
 Gloria and Sonny Kamm have hundreds of glass and ceramic sculptures, and 
Sonny's multimedia teapot collection, which also numbers in the hundreds, in 
their Sherman Oaks home. They have been diligent about protecting their 
collections. 
</P>
<P>
 Of other earthquakes they have been through, Gloria Kamm says, "We've had 5s 
and 5.2s, and we've never had anything fall over or move around," Gloria says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always knew psychologically we would have a problem with the Big One, and 
this came as close to the Big One as I care to have it," Sonny Kamm says. 
</P>
<P>
 Unscathed by the quake was the abstract major glass installation work in their 
stairwell. It was built into the wall by artist John Gilbert Luebtow. Because 
they had affixed smaller objects to pedestals and shelves with wax, most did 
not become airborne. 
</P>
<P>
 Their cabinets were bolted to the wall. But some of the glass shelves within, 
held in place with just a couple of pins, collapsed, creating a cascading 
effect that damaged several works. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had shards over the entire bedroom," Gloria Kamm says. "When something is 
lost, you always think you should have done better." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to silicon the shelves to the brackets and the back of the 
cabinets," Sonny Kamm says. 
</P>
<P>
 He is also looking into how to hang paintings more securely. In some 
instances, a painting fell off the wall, damaging it and nearby glass or 
ceramic objects. "I don't think I realized that part of the reason paintings 
fall is the wires snap because of the tension," he says. "As an old fisherman, 
I think there should be a redundancy of wires, and they should be coated with 
something so if they do snap, there's still something left there." 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding securing objects, Sonny Kamm has some caveats about using wax. "I 
think the waxing helps, but it's better for squatter pieces that aren't heavy. 
Once they get to be a certain weight, I think somebody is really kidding 
themselves thinking waxing will do," he says. "On a heavy piece, you really 
have to create a base. You have to use something like silicon. The problem with 
silicon is that if you silicon a delicate ceramic, you may not be able to get 
the base off of it. You can damage the piece just by trying to take it off. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are no pat answers, and being near the epicenter, all bets are off," 
Sonny Kamm says. 
</P>
<P>
 But being close to the epicenter doesn't mean everything that isn't secured 
will break, either. Nothing broke in a closet full of teapots that were free to 
move around at the Kamm house. 
</P>
<P>
 In Granada Hills, at the home of Bonnie Campbell and William Freeman, CSUN 
professors and Depression-era glass collectors, four good-sized glass pieces 
were launched into the air. The items -- "grand Art Deco stuff from the early 
'20s," Campbell says -- are probably intact because they were on a dresser that 
is low to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 During the quake, "the top drawer flew out, apparently on the upward movement 
of the dresser," she recalls. "The glass pieces slid into the drawer and 
traveled across the room with the drawer. There on the other side of the room 
was the drawer with my underwear and the glass on top, unharmed." 
</P>
<P>
 Adhesives purchased in a drugstore held down all but one of the tall, slender 
glass pieces of an artwork by Harvey Littleton at the Woodland Hills home of 
Jim and Paula McDonald. Yet, several large glass pieces by Dale Chihuly weren't 
tacked down, and they remained pretty much in place. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that I've seen what they've gone through, I'm thinking that they're 
better left alone," Paula McDonald says. "You think some of these are sitting 
flat, but they really aren't. And to get the stuff in exactly the right place 
is tricky. When I tried to do it, I felt like I was gonna break the piece 
myself in my clumsy attempts to get the contact in exactly the right place." 
</P>
<P>
 Collectors are also coping with their emotional responses to their losses. 
</P>
<P>
 "We gave serious thought, at least for a couple days, to chucking the whole 
thing and collecting something else. We decided not to," says Sonny Kamm. 
</P>
<P>
 "You go through many of the same things as when somebody dies," adds Gloria 
Kamm. "It's not quite as poignant, but you have had a loss of something that is 
meaningful in your life." 
</P>
<P>
 "I think five minutes after the quake, I said to Gloria: 'The typical thing 
that's going to happen is there's going to be a lot of temptation of 
recriminations, like, why didn't you do better about keeping up the insurance? 
Why didn't I wax down things better? Why didn't we stick a pole up that piece 
so it wouldn't topple?' I said, 'Why don't we make a pact -- we're not even 
going to talk about any of that.' It helped just to enunciate that really early 
on." 
</P>
<P>
 The Kamms also resisted the temptation to immediately throw broken pieces 
away. "I think that's a bad mistake," Sonny Kamm says. "We waited, and a couple 
of days later started trying to be a little more methodical. I'm glad we did. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a little bit of an embarrassment factor -- people think, oh, what a 
schmuck I am because we have all these delicate things and we know we live in 
earthquake territory. That's why they want to get rid of the stuff, so like 
nothing happened. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of the pieces can be saved, even some that are pretty badly broken. We 
had a piece restored once, and I was amazed at what was done. And maybe the 
shards can be used in some respect, to make a survival piece or an altar to the 
earthquake. Maybe your grandmother had 12 cups. You can restore one and keep it 
as a memento." 
</P>
<P>
 "I know people who are putting their things away in boxes, but that's not like 
us," says Beverly Gladstone about herself and her husband, Bruce. They collect 
glass and various other art objects. "We like them out where they can be seen 
and admired. Since I work at home, it pleases me to be surrounded by beautiful 
art objects. We've been here 32 years, through many earthquakes and none of 
this glass has broken. So we know that this house will sustain shakes and 
earthquake waves unless it's very violent, and that's a more rare occurrence. 
</P>
<P>
 "We display them with full knowledge that if a catastrophe happens, they're 
history. But you don't expect a catastrophe to happen. You can't dwell on these 
things because everything is ephemeral -- everything goes including yourself. 
So I'm just gonna put my art pieces back on with some Quake Wax and go on with 
my life." WHERE TO GO

POLITICAL BRIEFING: MAYBE HE KNOWS HOW MUCH TIME YOU GET FOR GOOD BEHAVIOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

 FIRST TO KNOW: Imagine how you'd feel if you waved the proverbial white flag 
at federal prosecutors and the first person to hear the details of your prison 
sentence was not you, but your archrival? 
</P>
<P>
 Ah, politics. 
</P>
<P>
 Former Assemblyman Pat Nolan, who pleaded guilty Feb. 18 to a racketeering 
count, was not happy upon discovering that Assembly Speaker Willie Brown (D-San 
Francisco) apparently knew of his 33-month sentence before he did. 
</P>
<P>
 "That just stinks," the Glendale Republican told a gathering of supporters in 
Burbank last week. "It's just wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 According to Nolan, he and his wife, Gail, were at his attorney's office when 
the lawyer phoned federal authorities with the news that Nolan would plead 
guilty to soliciting bribes. At that point, Nolan said, he thought he was 
facing a possible 24- to 27-month sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gail and I got up to leave and a call came in from Assemblyman (Jim) Brulte's 
office. I picked up the phone and Jim said, 'Willie (Brown) just told me that 
you've agreed to plead guilty and the terms of the agreement are 33 months," 
Nolan said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hadn't been told how many months in prison. He knew the details of the deal 
before I left my lawyer's office," Nolan said. "It's absolutely outrageous." 
</P>
<P>
 But Nolan stopped short of alleging outright that Brown -- with whom he'd 
developed a love-hate relationship over the years -- was somehow in cahoots 
with officials trying to nail the conservative Republican. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, throughout the evening, Nolan was careful not to cross an invisible 
line he had drawn for himself, unbeknownst to the supporters gathered to hear 
the defense case he presented -- complete with FBI transcripts and sting 
videotape. 
</P>
<P>
 Fearing that federal prosecutors might retaliate by going after him for 
perjury or placing him in a prison far from his family, Nolan never actually 
came out and said he lied in pleading guilty. Instead he portrayed himself as 
"a political prisoner" of federal agents who were "constantly skewing things." 
</P>
<P>
 He plans to spell out the whole story in the book he says he'll write in 
prison -- and publish after his release. 
</P>

<P>
 REAPING THE BOUNTY: Just to keep everything on the up and up, the Fair 
Political Practices Commission requires state legislators to disclose what 
sorts of gifts, loans, investments and income they've received in the past 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The annual financial-disclosure statements released in Sacramento this week 
reveal the usual goodies being accepted: football game tickets, candy, Ringling 
Bros. circus tickets, free airport parking, tie tacks, dinners, drinks and so 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 Some members, however, were more fortunate than others in hauling in the good 
stuff. 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Don Rogers (R-Tehachapi), who represents portions of the Antelope 
and Santa Clarita valleys, was the recipient of a whirlwind 13-day tour to 
Mexico City; Buenos Aires, Argentina, and Santiago, Chile. 
</P>
<P>
 With the California Foundation on the Environment and the Economy paying 
$7,555 for Rogers' expenses, he met with a host of officials who advocated 
deregulation and privatization of the natural-gas industry. 
</P>
<P>
 And state Sens. David A. Roberti (D-Van Nuys) and Newton R. Russell 
(R-Glendale) got to travel to Spain and Italy together last year -- putting 
aside their partisan differences for the good cause of representing California 
to foreign business leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 Roberti's campaign committee paid for much of the travel expenses, but once on 
foreign soil, the two senators each accepted $1,750 worth of lodging, meals and 
beverages from an Italian business and educational foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 And in Spain, both Roberti and Russell uncovered some real bargains, the 
disclosure forms show. As tokens of appreciation, the two senators received 
from their Spanish hosts ties valued at $10, silver-plated commemorative bowls 
valued at $10, tie pins valued at $5 and other gifts. 
</P>
<P>
 That's some exchange rate Spain has these days. 
</P>
<P>

<P>
 TUNING IN: Cable News Network (CNN) has heightened the profile of 
congressional candidate Richard Sybert, once a Cabinet-level official in Gov. 
Pete Wilson's administration, by singling out his campaign for special 
coverage. 
</P>
<P>
 The first of what Sybert expects to be several CNN reports on his campaign to 
secure the GOP primary and then defeat U.S. Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson 
(D-Woodland Hills) was broadcast Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 CNN focused on the Sybert campaign because it is an extremely well-funded 
effort (Sybert, an attorney and toy company executive, has loaned his campaign 
nearly $410,000) to unseat a leader of the House of Representatives. Beilenson 
is the second-highest-ranking Democratic member of the powerful Rules 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Sybert said the CNN report reflected what GOP insiders already know: that he 
will be mounting a highly professional and competitive campaign against 
Beilenson, who has represented the 24th Congressional District since 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 And the four-minute CNN piece apparently got some couch potatoes off their 
duffs. "We got calls from people who saw the piece and now want to help," 
Sybert said. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 KORMAN'S FOURTH: Speaking of well-financed campaigns, Sang Korman, the wealthy 
Korean-American businessman from the Conejo Valley, has thrown his hat into a 
local congressional race for the fourth time. 
</P>
<P>
 All told, Korman has spent more than three-quarters of a million dollars of 
his own money running for seats held by Beilenson and U.S. Rep. Elton Gallegly 
(R-Simi Valley). In 1992, Korman came in second in the 24th District GOP 
primary, scoring 24% of the vote. On Wednesday, Korman filed his nomination 
papers for a fourth bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Also running in the GOP primary are Mark Boos Benhard, a media relations 
executive, and Robert Hammer, a banking consultant. 
</P>
<P>
 Korman could not be reached for comment, but Sybert said he did not expect 
Korman's candidacy to have a significant impact on the race. "He's run three 
times before," he said. "What is different about this time?" 
</P>
<P>
 But others are wondering if Korman's presence won't make the GOP primary a 
more costly affair -- both in cash and self-inflicted political mayhem -- while 
Beilenson rests on the sidelines waiting for the main event.

PLACENTIA PIONEER MARTINA AGUIRRE, 99, DIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SHELBY GRAD, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Martina V. Aguirre, a Placentia pioneer who ran a clothing business in the 
city for half a century, died this week of kidney failure. She was 99. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in Mexico, Mrs. Aguirre and her husband, Jose, moved to Placentia in 1919 
to escape the Mexican Revolution and reunite with family members already in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Aguirres ran a neighborhood grocery store and barber shop for many years 
before Jose Aguirre died in 1935. 
</P>
<P>
 Left to raise 10 children alone, Mrs. Aguirre soon opened a clothing and dry 
goods shop out of her home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like a little JC Penney," said Frederick P. Aguirre, a Fullerton 
attorney and Mrs. Aguirre's grandson. "It was a real neighborhood store. She 
catered mostly to women who were buying clothes for their children and 
families. She used to sell a lot of things on credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Aguirre regularly took the train or bus to the Los Angeles garment 
district to buy merchandise for her business.  
</P>
<P>
 "She never went on welfare or any kind of public assistance," Frederick 
Aguirre said. "She was very independent and sharp." 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. Aguirre continued to run the business until she was 94 and arthritis 
forced her to move in with relatives. 
</P>
<P>
 She is survived by five children, 51 grandchildren and 112 
great-grandchildren. Her surviving children are Alfred Aguirre, a former 
Placentia councilman who helped desegregate local schools; Sara Miranda of 
Mission Viejo; Joe Aguirre of Placentia; Frank Aguirre of Anaheim, and Aileen 
Olivas of Placentia.

JITTERS BUT NO BIG CORRECTIONS ON WALL STREET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Times Staff and Wire Reports 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rising interest rates sent stock prices lower Thursday, but jittery markets 
continued to avoid the type of dramatic correction that many investors feared. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Wednesday, when stocks staged a dramatic comeback, the market struggled 
unsuccessfully to fully recover from a bout of selling in the morning. Most 
measures of stock performance ended the session with modest losses. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average finished down 7.32 at 3,824.42, after 
improving from a loss of more than 20 points during the morning's selloff. 
Broadly based measures dominated by New York Stock Exchange issues also lost 
ground. The NYSE composite fell 0.79 to 256.68 and the Standard & Poor's 500 
index dropped 1.80 to 463.01. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the market mostly shrugged off the turmoil in some overseas stock and 
bond markets, which has caused large losses for a number of major banks and 
speculative investment funds. Bank stocks continued to fall on fears that they 
had sustained substantial losses on risky currency and bond trades and stock 
plays in emerging markets. 
</P>
<P>
 Gauges of smaller stocks fared better. The Nasdaq composite gained 1.11 to 
784.58, helped by strength in a range of computer and technology shares. At the 
American Stock Exchange, the market value index dipped 0.67 to 465.65. 
</P>
<P>
 Losers outnumbered gainers on the NYSE by about 5 to 4, and volume on the Big 
Board eased to 291.79 million shares. On Wednesday, a much heavier total of 
361.12 million shares changed hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Stocks took their cue from the bond market, where prices declined, causing a 
corresponding increase in interest rates. Prices of all maturities of 
government notes and bonds moved down, with the 30-year Treasury bond off about 
3/4 point, driving up its yield to 6.84% from 6.77% on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Bonds were sold for technical reasons -- and in response to fresh evidence of 
economic strength. The Labor Department reported that the number of Americans 
filing first-time claims for jobless benefits fell by 57,000 last week to the 
lowest level since Christmas, marking the steepest decline since August, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Financial markets have been fearful that the rebounding economy will breed 
inflation, prompting the Federal Reserve Board to implement additional interest 
rate hikes to head off price pressures. A gentle nudge upward in rates by the 
Fed in early February has put the markets on guard for additional tightening in 
monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
 Worries about a possible trade war with Japan also curbed interest in buying 
stocks. The Clinton Administration reinstated a trade law provision known as 
Super 301, giving the government a mechanism to retaliate against Japan if that 
country doesn't try to reduce its $59.3-billion annual trade surplus with the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the White House announcement, the dollar fell against the yen, 
slipping to 103.77 yen in late New York trading, from Wednesday's 104.20. But 
the U.S. currency gained ground against many other foreign currencies. 
</P>
<P>
 Investors were also worried about possible fallout from market turmoil in 
Europe, where bond prices have fallen dramatically in response to fears of 
higher interest rates in Germany. Stock prices on many small, emerging markets 
overseas -- many of which have risen dramatically over the past year -- have 
also been falling. 
</P>
<P>
 Those events have caused big losses for some major investment funds, known as 
hedge funds. One fund controlled by legendary speculator George Soros confirmed 
last week that it has lost about $600 million in global markets. Large losses 
also reportedly have been sustained by speculator Michael Steinhardt. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps more worrisome is the fact that some major banks that have large 
trading operations -- notably Bankers Trust and J.P. Morgan -- also reportedly 
have taken big hits. Bankers Trust shares continued to fall Thursday, losing 2 
to 76 1/2 after dropping 2 1/4 on Wednesday. Most other banking issues were 
also lower. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the hedge funds were making big bets that rates would come down in 
Europe, and they blew it," said Philip Dubuque, a fund manager at Chestnut Hill 
Management in Boston. "And when the banks get nervous, they get nervous very 
quickly," in turn dumping declining bonds at a loss, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But market watchers said the problems at banks did not appear to be severe or 
widespread, and that troubles in the European bond market would have only a 
limited impact on the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeremy Siegel, a professor of finance at the Wharton School of Business, said 
the losses on bond trading were mainly a "retracing" of earlier gains. Only a 
dramatic, sustained rise in interest rates, he said, would be a real threat to 
the big trading operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Many technology stocks managed to buck the downward trend. On the Nasdaq, Dell 
Computer topped the actives list, spurting 2 1/8 to 27. Dell posted 
fourth-quarter results that exceeded Wall Street expectations.

<P>
 Joining a growing collection of novels by young women from the Indian 
subcontinent, "Love, Stars and All That" is the latest entry in a uniquely 
American literary category. 
</P>
<P>
 Like their European predecessors, these writers are concerned with the 
invention of an American self, a process differing in several essential 
respects from the experience and the literature of earlier immigrant groups. In 
company with Bharati Mukherjee and Anita Desai, Kirin Narayan is an academic, 
one of an increasing number of Indian students who came to the United States 
and stayed on to teach. 
</P>
<P>
 This author's field is anthropology, a discipline ideally suited to her 
fictional but clearly semi-autobiographical subject: the gradual, occasionally 
painful and often hilarious process by which a girl from a sheltered background 
steeped in tradition and custom becomes an independent and successful American 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 When Gita Das arrives to pursue her graduate studies at Berkeley, she's a 
winsome innocent, an alumna of a strict Catholic convent school and the 
university in Delhi. At 23, she's not only a virgin, but has yet to experience 
what she thinks of as a real kiss.  
</P>
<P>
 To her roommate, Bet, an aspiring actress "celibate by default," Gita is an 
incomprehensible phenomenon who spends her Saturday nights washing and 
conditioning her knee-length hair while poring over highly specialized 
folkloric texts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Look, I don't need to waste my time dating because I know when things will 
change," Gita says. "My Saroj-Aunty's astrologer has already told me: In 
Chaitra twenty-forty I'll meet the right man." According to our calendar, 
that's March, 1984, the month and year in which Gita's American odyssey begins. 
</P>
<P>
 A generous amount of flashback supplies Gita's pre-Berkeley history. The 
daughter of an Indian nationalist father whom she scarcely knew and a frivolous 
social butterfly mother who remarried a diplomat soon after her first husband's 
death, Gita grew up spending her holidays in the spacious home of Saroj-Aunty 
and her genial husband, close friends of her real father but no actual 
relation. As a result, her ties to these honorary relatives are far closer than 
those to her mother and stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a passionate radical, Saroj-Aunty has aged gracefully, happily accepting 
the luxury in which she now lives but maintaining a delightfully rebellious 
spirit. Even so, she's enough of a traditionalist to believe in arranged 
marriages, particularly for her proteges, a sizable group of "nieces" and 
"nephews" in which Gita is clearly a favorite. That prior life -- bound by 
ritual, influenced by the lingering heritage of caste and eased by platoons of 
servants -- is about as far from the usual route to Telegraph Avenue as you can 
find on this planet. 
</P>
<P>
 Although there's a network of other Indian students on campus, they're all 
busily engaged in making their own accommodation to the strange new world in 
which they find themselves, too preoccupied to spare much time for the newest 
arrivals. Except for an occasional encounter with Firoze, the rumpled and 
earnest "cousin-brother" of a school friend, Gita is on her own. 
</P>
<P>
 When Saroj-Aunty meets a San Francisco poet in an airport and asks him to 
deliver a bottle of perfume to her "niece," Gita immediately decides that he is 
her ordained fate. 
</P>
<P>
 It is, after all, the magic month, and despite the fact that Timothy Stilling 
in no way resembles the darkly handsome Indian husband of her dreams, Gita 
falls in love with him, a one-sided attachment that soon leads to her 
involvement with a friend of his, one Norvin Weinstein, a professor whose wife 
is conveniently teaching in another city. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since a pilgrimage to India in the '60s, Weinstein has been romantically 
drawn to that country and to its young female exports. Gita is exactly what he 
has been seeking and soon responds to his practiced approach. 
</P>
<P>
 The burgeoning relationship with Norvin affords the author a wonderful 
opportunity to send up not only the American academic Establishment but its 
Indian counterpart, both of which Gita is in a perfect position to observe when 
she becomes Norvin's second wife. 
</P>
<P>
 The courtship is a satiric delight, especially the scene in which Gita 
nervously enters a Marin County hot tub, completely veiled by her luxuriant 
hair. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the marriage unravels, Gita's academic career flourishes, bringing 
her poise and self-assurance along with success. From time to time, the 
dialogue delineating this transformation seems a bit didactic, but the process 
itself is entertaining and excruciatingly realistic, replete with meticulously 
observed characters from both sides of the cultural chasm.  
</P>
<P>
 Even the rushed and anti-climactic ending doesn't spoil the effect. After all, 
the real finale was the moment Gita cut her hair, a step as drastic and 
definitive in its way as Nora Helmer's slamming the door in "A Doll's House."

O.C. MOVIE REVIEW; 'CHINA MOON' DOESN'T QUITE GEL BUT KEEPS YOU GUESSING 
</P>

<P>
 It's been a while since we've had a murder mystery where the lead character 
talks about the strange things people do under a full moon. 
</P>
<P>
 "China Moon," starring Ed Harris as a homicide detective who becomes involved 
in a crime of passion with a sulky, abused millionaire's wife in Central 
Florida, played by Madeleine Stowe, is full of portentous mumbo-jumbo. 
</P>
<P>
 It's also full of hard-boiled attitudes out of James M. Cain and Raymond 
Chandler. The combo doesn't quite gel: when Harris' Kyle Bodine announces that 
he's an "orphan of destiny," you begin to long for Fred MacMurray's Walter Neff 
to step in and set him straight. 
</P>
<P>
 John Bailey, the celebrated cinematographer ("American Gigolo," "Ordinary 
People") making his directorial debut, doesn't try to shoot the works. His 
direction is a lot less florid than Ron Carlson's script. (Carlson, according 
to the press notes, "wrote counterintelligence manuals for the defense industry 
and the federal government before turning to screenplays.") Bailey's 
straight-ahead craftsmanship is an honest approach to all the crime-thriller 
shenanigans and switcheroos; he hews to the characters and this pays off when 
the surprises come. (When the big plot twist finally kicked in, a woman at the 
preview screening shouted, " Now we have a movie.) 
</P>
<P>
 The characters don't have much depth -- just enough to elevate them from 
cardboard to poster board. Without the presence of Harris and Stowe, "China 
Moon" might have been ridiculous, but they both seem entranced by each other's 
moody, fixated stares. (On the heels of "Blink," Stowe seems to be making a 
specialty of ravaged, neurasthenic waifs.) 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps they are playing out an actor's fantasy of enveloping oneself in 
film-noir fatalism. This may be the fantasy of the filmmakers too, which is why 
"China Moon" (countywide) never quite seems real. It'LAT
