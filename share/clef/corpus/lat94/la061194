SHADOW OF ANOTHER FAMINE BRINGS APPEALS BY ETHIOPIA; AFRICA: RELIEF SPECIALISTS 
WELCOME GOVERNMENT'S CANDOR BUT THINK CALLS MAY BE PREMATURE, MISLEADING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The shadow of famine again hangs over East Africa: In nine countries from 
Djibouti to Rwanda, 20 million people are at risk, relief agencies say, and 
international donors are scrambling to meet emergency needs for food. 
</P>
<P>
 But there is disagreement in the international community over how advanced the 
threat is. 
</P>
<P>
 Some relief specialists believe that Ethiopia's call for help -- originally 
made last December and repeated often since -- may have been premature and 
could obscure the fact that any widespread danger is likely to occur in 1995, 
not 1994. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government has been very open, and that's greatly welcome," said Mark 
Bidder, deputy coordinator for the U.N. Development Program. "There is a 
feeling, though, it may have gone a little overboard. It hasn't made a mountain 
out of a molehill, but it's made one out of a hill. We're not in a crisis yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Bidder said if this summer's rains are inadequate, it is possible the current 
drought could turn into a famine of epoch proportions, such as the one in 1984, 
centered in Ethiopia's Wollo province. That famine claimed hundreds of 
thousands of lives in the Horn of Africa. 
</P>
<P>
 But after an ample harvest in 1992, sufficient rains between now and September 
could alleviate the likelihood of massive starvation, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Drought is a recurring curse in the Horn of Africa, and in Ethiopia's rural 
provinces north and south of Addis Ababa, people live on the edge of survival 
even in years of bountiful harvests. 
</P>
<P>
 Though fertile, the land is so intensely cultivated and deforested that people 
there have little hope of ever escaping the peril of malnutrition and the need 
for emergency supplies of wheat, soybeans and maize, agricultural experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ethiopian government's candor in calling attention to the early warnings 
of famine -- the death of children in Bele, the airdrop of grain in Oromiya, 
bureaucratic bottlenecks that have delayed food shipments for months for lack 
of an official signature -- is a dramatic departure from how two previous 
governments in Addis Ababa treated full-blown disasters. 
</P>
<P>
 When drought swept Wollo province in 1973, Emperor Haile Selassie, 81, tried 
to keep the disaster a secret, unwilling to admit that he was unable to care 
for his people. 
</P>
<P>
 While the death toll crept toward 200,000, Selassie was photographed in the 
splendor of his palace tossing scraps of fresh meat to his two Great Danes. The 
picture caused a national scandal, and Selassie was overthrown within the year 
by a group of enlisted men, ending a 44-year reign. 
</P>
<P>
 The leader of the group, Mengistu Haile Mariam, courted disaster in 1984 when 
he denied the existence of famine that had claimed many thousands of lives. 
</P>
<P>
 At the height of the calamity, he spent millions of dollars on a huge 
celebration marking the anniversary of his Marxist revolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Later, finally acknowledging the famine, he used food as a weapon, refusing to 
let relief agencies feed Ethiopians in regions controlled by anti-government 
forces. Mengistu was overthrown in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the 1984 famine, the international community has changed its emphasis in 
Africa from disaster response to crisis prevention. 
</P>
<P>
 "Any development program these days that doesn't have the word sustainable on 
every page has no chance of getting off the ground," a U.N. official in Eritrea 
said. But escaping Africa's morass of man-made disasters that foster famine has 
not been easy. 
</P>
<P>
 J. Brian Atwood, head of the U.S. Agency for International Development, said 
here last month that about one-third of those facing food shortages in East 
Africa were at risk because of wars, primarily in Sudan, Somalia and Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Internal insecurity also threatens the delivery of food in parts of Kenya and 
Djibouti. 
</P>
<P>
 Atwood's mission to assess food needs in East Africa was made at the request 
of President Clinton, U.S. diplomats said, and was intended in part to help 
three governments -- in Ethiopia, Eritrea and Uganda -- avoid crises that could 
threaten national stability. All three have adopted pragmatic economic policies 
and have been helpful in mediating regional conflicts. 
</P>
<P>
 But with the Cold War over, Atwood's mission came at a time when Western 
governments are shifting developmental funds from Africa to Eastern Europe. 
Questions are also being raised about the usefulness of pouring countless 
dollars into countries whose leaders are required to provide little 
accountability. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. aid to Kenya, for example, has been cut about in half, to $18 million. In 
southern Sudan, a region racked by war and starvation and ruled by an 
uncompromising Islamic fundamentalist government, the U.S. bill for emergency 
aid last year reached $350 million and "probably didn't achieve anything," an 
American aid official in Kenya said. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington also spent $1.5 billion trying to halt starvation and anarchy in 
Somalia. It was forced to retreat after Somali clans turned on U.S. soldiers.

U.S. TO PROBE FAA'S HANDLING OF JET TURBULENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BRAZIL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 U. S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena on Friday ordered a review to 
determine whether the Federal Aviation Administration waited too long before 
instituting new safety rules designed to prevent accidents caused by wake 
turbulence from Boeing 757 jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came five days after The Times, citing FAA internal 
documents, revealed that before two accidents that claimed 13 lives, the 
agency's top scientist warned that 757 wake turbulence would cause a major 
crash if the agency failed to require smaller aircraft to stay farther behind 
757s than called for at the time. "Serious questions have been raised regarding 
the timeliness of the agency's actions over the past several years," Pena said 
in a statement. "This review will evaluate whether FAA has the proper 
procedures in place to ensure that we are apprised of safety concerns at the 
earliest possible time so appropriate action can be taken in a timely way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traveling public entrusts its safety to this department," Pena added. 
"Maintaining that trust and that responsibility is essential." 
</P>
<P>
 FAA scientist Robert E. Machol expressed concerns about the 757 threat as far 
back as 1990. But it wasn't until December -- after the crash of a private 
jetliner in Santa Ana claimed the lives of five people -- that FAA 
Administrator David R. Hinson issued a bulletin instructing air traffic 
controllers nationwide to routinely warn pilots of smaller aircraft of the 
threat posed by the air turbulence in the wake of 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 In response to recommendations made by the National Transportation Safety 
Board in February, Hinson announced an interim policy in May requiring 
controllers to increase the distance smaller planes should stay behind 757s 
during landings from three miles to four miles. 
</P>
<P>
 Although aviation experts disagree on the level of danger involved, the 
plane's unique, fuel-efficient design creates invisible "horizontal tornadoes" 
emanating from each wingtip that are more powerful and last longer than those 
made by other aircraft its size. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has maintained that there was insufficient data to demand immediate 
intervention. But the agency issued its new policy with no new data other than 
the two fatal crashes and three serious incidents or close calls in the 
previous 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued Friday by the FAA's Hinson said: "I share the secretary's 
concerns about the timeliness of the actions over the past several years 
regarding this issue and the adequacy of the process used by the agency in 
considering those actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public," Hinson said, "is entitled to be assured that the FAA has acted, 
and can act in the future, with appropriate speed when the facts warrant." 
</P>
<P>
 The review, to be completed by July 22, will also examine whether the FAA 
followed procedures outlined in the federal Freedom of Information Act in 
providing full information on the 757 issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although The Times sought records on 757 wake turbulence under that act in 
January, it was not until May -- after the newspaper appealed one agency 
rejection -- that the FAA surrendered 226 pages in internal letters and 
memoranda, which showed that the agency was made aware of the 757 problem years 
ago from within its own ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the documents provided by the FAA, The Times obtained from independent 
sources an Oct. 3, 1989, memo suggesting the agency was sensitive to public 
perception on the issue of wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 The memo, written by Machol and addressed to two members of the FAA management 
staff, at one point said Machol didn't understand why there weren't more wake 
turbulence disasters in light of the FAA's wake turbulence policies. At the top 
of the memo, someone wrote: "Bob: A note of caution -- please watch your 
wording -- I don't want 'smoking guns' in our files." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson has directed an agencywide review of responses to Freedom of 
Information Act requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials said The Times' request appears to have been mishandled, 
though not deliberately, by lower-level employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials said the wake turbulence review would be conducted by a panel 
made up of a small number of people from the FAA and the Department of 
Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 An agency official said it would focus on: "When did the FAA know what it knew 
and how soon thereafter was it in a position to make a decision and were those 
decisions made in a timely fashion?" 
</P>
<P>
 Although it is not uncommon for the FAA to conduct its own reviews, agency 
officials said, it was unusual for Transportation Department officials to take 
part in such a review. In part, the department is involved to lend credibility 
to the review -- "so it doesn't look like the FAA looked at itself and said 
everything is all right," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Leo Garodz, a former FAA manager who expressed concerns about 757 wake 
turbulence to the FAA in 1991 as a consultant, welcomed the review. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I've said before, it sometimes takes a catastrophic event to get programs 
back on the burner," he said. "That's what happened here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating," added Garodz, who was retained by the FAA to test the 
level of 757 wake turbulence in 1990. "They hired me to do the wake vortex 
research. . . . We did it, we made recommendations and nothing was done about 
it until now." 
</P>
<P>
 The 757, a twin-engine narrow-body jet praised by pilots for its handling and 
safety, has been flown for more than a decade. It is unclear to those in the 
aviation industry why accidents and incidents involving 757 turbulence are a 
relatively recent phenomenon. Some have suggested it is because there are many 
more 757s flying and because commercial pilots are increasingly being pressured 
to cut delays, which can often mean following closer behind aircraft than is 
advised. 
</P>
<P>
 The hazard is greatest during landing and takeoff, when a smaller plane can 
inadvertently fall below the 757's path and find itself entangled in 
hurricane-force winds. 
</P>
<P>
 Turbulence from 757s is suspected to have played a part in two crashes of 
small aircraft that were landing behind the sleek-bodied jets. Eight people 
died in a Billings, Mont., crash on Dec. 18, 1992. Five people, including two 
executives from the In-N-Out Burger Chain, died in a Dec. 15, 1993, accident in 
Santa Ana. Eleven days before the Billings crash, Machol attended a special 
meeting with the FAA's hierarchy and predicted a catastrophe resulting from 757 
wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has resisted efforts to increase separation distances between large 
jets and tailing airplanes because it could potentially decrease the number of 
flights at the nation's busiest airports. That could cut into revenue of the 
already financially hard-hit airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson said in Friday's statement that the recently adopted measures 
appropriately address safety issues involving the 757. However, the agency has 
embarked on a two-year study of 757 wake turbulence to determine whether the 
new four-mile separation distance is apt. The Air Line Pilots Assn., the 
largest organization of pilots in the world, advises pilots of smaller planes 
to stay five miles behind 757s; the British equivalent of the FAA, the Civil 
Aviation Authority, requires from four to six miles of separation behind 757s, 
depending on the size of the trailing plane.

EDWARD KIENHOLZ, SCULPTOR OF JARRING TABLEAUX, DIES; EXPRESSIONISM: 
CONTROVERSIAL ARTIST EXAMINED SEAMY SIDE OF LIFE. 'BACK SEAT DODGE '38' SPARKED 
FUROR IN L.A. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Edward Kienholz, the angry sculptor with the menacing eyebrows whose life-size 
tableaux made him one of America's most sociologically salacious but famous art 
symbols, died Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Kienholz -- whose most controversial works encompassed the seamier side of 
human life, from the erotic "Back Seat Dodge '38" in the 1960s with its 
infamous couple locked in tawdry embrace to more recent re-creations of dens of 
prostitution in Nevada and Amsterdam -- had become a searing presence on the 
international art scene. 
</P>
<P>
 The artist Times critic William Wilson called "the Paul Bunyan of American 
art" was 66 when he died in the tiny town of Hope, Ida. 
</P>
<P>
 His longtime friend and dealer, Peter Goulds, said from his L.A. Louver 
gallery in Venice that Kienholz suffered what appeared to be a massive heart 
attack although "he had been in apparent good health." 
</P>
<P>
 He had moved in the last three decades of his life from a troubled man whose 
experiences as a worker in mental institutions and observer of world poverty 
pushed him to produce life-size representations of his disappointments to 
softer, more warming observations of the human condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Goulds said it was his 21-year marriage to Nancy Reddin Kienholz, who was also 
his collaborator on the later works, which helped bring about that 
transformation. 
</P>
<P>
 His recent "Merry Go World or Begat by Chance and the Wonderhorse Trigger" was 
a caring yet carefree tribute to the uncertainties, the random chance of life. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a carousel entered through a single door. Viewers gaze through windows 
of the world at portrayals of the poverty of Africa, the intricate histories of 
China, and the comforts of the West, for example. 
</P>
<P>
 Goulds described it as "a view of choice each of us might have shared" were it 
not for the accident of our particular birth. 
</P>
<P>
 If Kienholz, who lived in Los Angeles from 1953 to 1973, had been an angry, 
almost mythical presence on the art scene in his youth, he became a humanist in 
his mid- and older years. 
</P>
<P>
 That presence never made itself more known than in 1966, when he incurred the 
wrath of the Los Angeles County Board of Supervisors, which attempted to censor 
a major exhibition of his work at the then-new County Museum of Art. 
</P>
<P>
 The focal point of that exhibit was his challenging "Dodge" and the outrage 
many felt over the sexual embraces in its back seat.  
</P>
<P>
 After a stormy series of meetings and compromises, the show went on, but 
Kienholz later recalled the flap as "a hell of a turning point" in his own 
development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Up to that time I played the farm boy, scuffling my feet and saying, 'Aw 
shucks.' I always said I didn't like words and that was why I made art, but I 
had to take a stand. It was a moment of growing up." 
</P>
<P>
 At that point he had come light years from the farm in Fairfield, Wash., where 
he was born in 1927. 
</P>
<P>
 Kienholz had little art education but had a lengthy odd-job resume when he 
arrived in Los Angeles and saw his first galleries. 
</P>
<P>
 He opened the Now Gallery and Syndell Studios in 1956 and co-founded with 
Walter Hopps the now famous Ferus Gallery in 1957. 
</P>
<P>
 His first efforts at art involved collages, some of simple wood shavings glued 
to canvasses in an abstract expressionist mode. 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery became a place where young painters and sculptors who shared 
similar aesthetics gathered to work and philosophize. At that point Kienholz 
was still painting and fashioning objects from simple sources. Soon he began to 
place more objects in his collages. From there he evolved to the free-standing, 
often grotesque and life-size abstractions that became his famous tableaux. 
</P>
<P>
 He sold his interest in Ferus and began concentrating exclusively on his 
tableaux, moving to the Virginia Dwan Gallery in Westwood. From there his 
reputation began to stretch, soon to New York City. 
</P>
<P>
 In his work he utilized all his life experiences: from visits to houses of ill 
repute to his views on an unpopular war in Southeast Asia. 
</P>
<P>
 He was temperate regarding loose women; furious with a stringent society that 
ordered its youth to its death, and unforgiving of a culture that undervalued 
art. 
</P>
<P>
 By then some of his pieces were also being accepted in Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 "Most of my work is about death or impending stoppage," he said in 1981. "We 
have never had a war on our land, so we don't know devastation. Europeans have 
experienced it and they understand what I'm doing." 
</P>
<P>
 After accepting a grant to work for a year in Berlin in 1973, he returned to 
the United States to live in such disparate cities as Hope in Idaho and 
Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Gradually his work moved from jarring, intense anger to what Goulds called "a 
humanism larger than the work itself." 
</P>
<P>
 He had brought two children to his fifth marriage, she one. And the couple 
found their new homes free from street crime and supportive of education for 
their children. 
</P>
<P>
 Wilson credited the artist with a "combination where theater, literature, jazz 
and the fine visual arts all worked as one. His influence in my judgment is so 
profound and so pervasive as to place him along with Jackson Pollock and Andy 
Warhol as one of the great contemporary American artists. 
</P>
<P>
 "Long before subjects of social and political issues were considered proper 
for the fine visual arts, Kienholz dealt in such forbidden subjects as child 
abuse, prostitution and abortion." 
</P>
<P>
 The closest understanding of Kienholz's creativity came from his wife.  
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes when Ed is working and a piece is going well, it seems that his 
hands take over," she said before his death. 
</P>
<P>
 He agreed, adding: "I think we are all crippled by a fear of dying. To be 
engaged in art is to get past that and get in touch with the unconscious." 
</P>
<P>
 Goulds said that memorial services are being planned but that only one thing 
thus far is definite. 
</P>
<P>
 "He will be buried as he wished -- in his favorite Packard" -- on acreage he 
owned near his home in Idaho.

TROOPER SAYS CLINTON MEETING WAS JONES' IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SARA FRITZ, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Arkansas state trooper acknowledged Friday that he saw Paula Corbin Jones 
enter a hotel room occupied by then-Gov. Bill Clinton in 1991, but he insisted 
she did so on her own initiative rather than at Clinton's request. 
</P>
<P>
 The account contained in a court brief submitted by trooper Danny Lee Ferguson 
in response to Jones' high-profile sexual harassment suit against Clinton 
further complicates an already tangled affair. It differs sharply from her 
version of the incident, but it also contradicts the White House position that 
the incident did not occur. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, Ferguson, 41, a co-defendant in the suit, told a very different 
account of the incident to The Times in interviews last year, potentially 
undermining his credibility in the case. In those interviews, Ferguson 
described Clinton as the instigator of the encounter. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones asserted in her lawsuit, filed here on May 6, that Ferguson approached 
her at a meeting of the Arkansas Industrial Development Commission at the 
Excelsior Hotel, handed her a piece of paper with a hotel room number scrawled 
on it and said: "The governor would like to meet you." 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson flatly denied that crucial element of Jones' story, and instead 
implied in his brief that the woman volunteered to meet with Clinton because -- 
as he claims she put it -- she liked "his good looks and his sexy demeanor." He 
said she also inquired whether Clinton had a girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus Ferguson's brief appears to undermine a fundamental ground of Jones' 
sexual harassment case: that Clinton, as the nominal head of the development 
commission for which she worked, illegally sought to use his authority as her 
employer to lure her into his hotel room. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson admitted riding up in a hotel elevator with Jones and showing her the 
room where she found Clinton. He denied her contention that he stood watch 
outside while she was there, or that he was "displaying a firearm on his 
person" at the time. 
</P>
<P>
 Predictably, Ferguson said he has no knowledge of what occurred inside the 
hotel room, where Jones claims she rebuffed the governor's entreaties for oral 
sex. But when he saw Jones later, he said, she did not appear to be upset by 
it, as she now claims. 
</P>
<P>
 In the weeks and months following her alleged meeting with Clinton on May 8, 
1991, Jones claims she ran into Ferguson several times, and he once told her 
the governor wanted her phone number because he "would like to see you." 
</P>
<P>
 On the contrary, Ferguson now contends that on that occasion Jones asked for a 
piece of paper, wrote her telephone number on it and asked him to give it to 
the governor. If her boyfriend answered the phone, she allegedly told him, 
Clinton should hang up or say he reached a wrong number. 
</P>
<P>
 After the American Spectator published an account of the events, identifying 
Jones only as "Paula," Jones and Ferguson had another chance meeting at a North 
Little Rock steakhouse. 
</P>
<P>
 According to her suit, Jones confronted Ferguson and demanded to know why he 
had given her name to a magazine reporter and why the magazine had falsely 
implied that she had sex with Clinton. According to his brief, she instead 
asked his advice about how much money she could make by selling her story to 
the news media. 
</P>
<P>
 In his earlier interviews with The Times, Ferguson told a story that was 
generally similar to the one contained in Jones' brief. He recalled that 
Clinton directed him to approach Jones on his behalf and invite her to meet 
privately with him. "Clinton sent me over to tell her she has that come-hither 
look," Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Acting on Clinton's orders, Ferguson told The Times, he first secured a hotel 
room for Clinton by telling the hotel manager that the governor was expecting 
an important call from the White House. "He gave us a room and Clinton sent me 
down" to invite Jones to the room, Ferguson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jones claims her private meeting with Clinton lasted 15 minutes; Ferguson, in 
the interview, said it was 30 minutes. When she emerged from the room, he said, 
she then volunteered to be Clinton's steady girlfriend. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said in his interviews with The Times that Clinton emerged from the 
encounter and told him " . . . we only talked." 
</P>
<P>
 Jones is seeking damages of $700,000, claiming she suffered retaliation on her 
job after rejecting Clinton's advances. She said she was prompted to file the 
suit because Clinton had denied her story, implying she was a liar. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Robert S. Bennett, Clinton's attorney, said Ferguson's response 
mostly helped Clinton. "It obviously contradicts the essentials of her claim," 
he said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer William C. Rempel and special correspondent Pam Strickland 
contributed to this story.

CAL/EPA'S NEWEST HAZARD: RISKS TO PEACE OF MIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By FRANK CLIFFORD, TIMES ENVIRONMENTAL WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After a 2 1/2-year study involving hundreds of people around the state, 
California has come up with a new and controversial method of evaluating 
environmental risk that downplays the traditional role of science and takes 
into account people's values, opinions, fears and anxieties. 
</P>
<P>
 Intended to guide decision-making by the state's Environmental Protection 
Agency, the new approach to risk assessment already is provoking an outcry in 
the business community. Critics argue that such broad, subjective criteria will 
create new layers of regulation and endless obstacles to development. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the most comprehensive, ambitious of its kind ever undertaken," said 
James Strock, state EPA secretary. 
</P>
<P>
 Although similar efforts in other states have tended to prioritize risks on 
the basis of their effects on healthy adults, the California Comparative Risk 
Project would attach a higher priority to environmental problems that have a 
disproportionate effect on children or minority populations, or if they are 
seen as disrupting the social welfare of a community or even its peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Peace of mind pollution? Yes, indeed. The 640-page report, expected to be 
released this month, defines peace of mind as: "Good mental health, trust of 
governing institutions, access to reliable information, personal security and 
healthy personal relationships." 
</P>
<P>
 The report, obtained by The Times in advance of its release, takes its most 
subjective turn in a chapter that says an environmental problem can threaten 
people's social welfare if it mars a view of a pleasing landscape or damages a 
child's "view of their world as a safe and nurturing place." 
</P>
<P>
 The project is based on the premise that science-based risk assessment is too 
uncertain given its heavy reliance on animal test results that may not apply to 
humans. While government regulators wait for the definitive studies on the 
dangers of agricultural pesticides or industrial emissions, pollution can run 
rampant, goes the thinking behind the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the first major project of its kind in the country that basically 
owned up to the fact that totally relying on experts and technical data is too 
narrow an approach," said John Moore, a Washington risk-assessment consultant 
who spent 20 years at the National Institutes of Health and the federal 
Environmental Protection Agency. Moore was a member of the project's advisory 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the report, "Risk is the likelihood of harmful effects, including 
human disease or death, damage to ecosystems, property losses and anxiety about 
the future." 
</P>
<P>
 "The study tells us to look at 'hot spots,' " said Charles Shulock, the state 
EPA's chief deputy director of environmental health hazard assessment.  
</P>
<P>
 "It tells us to look at farm worker communities exposed to high levels of 
pesticides, children who are more vulnerable to respiratory diseases, or 
subsistence fishermen who may ingest dangerously high levels of mercury because 
they eat more fish." 
</P>
<P>
 The project divides environmental risks into three categories: human health, 
ecosystem health and social welfare. 
</P>
<P>
 The most serious hazards to human health include secondhand tobacco smoke, 
radon, ozone and an assortment of chemical contaminants, such as mercury and 
arsenic, found in fish and drinking water. 
</P>
<P>
 Cited among the highest risks to ecological health are greenhouse gases 
released from the burning of fossil fuels, clear-cutting of forests and 
diversion of water from rivers and estuaries, particularly in the San Francisco 
Bay delta system. 
</P>
<P>
 The social welfare category repeated several types of risks listed elsewhere 
and added pesticides, lead and particulate matter. 
</P>
<P>
 A collaboration of people representing government, business, environmental 
organizations, academia and community groups, the study has been a hot potato 
from the outset, with business critics frequently challenging the methodology. 
</P>
<P>
 A recent imbroglio has delayed the public release of the report, which had 
been scheduled for release Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week, Michael DiBartolomeis Jr., an EPA toxicologist who coordinated the 
work of citizen volunteers and government technocrats, suddenly quit the 
project, citing interference by Strock. 
</P>
<P>
 DiBartolomeis objected to Strock's decision to interrupt the printing of the 
study in order to append Strock's views of the project, some of them critical. 
DiBartolomeis says that the cost of the study, about $350,000, will go up 
another $20,000 as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 Strock's action aroused suspicions among some of those who participated that 
he was succumbing to pressure from business interests. 
</P>
<P>
 But Strock said he is only trying to explain how the study would be used. 
"This is in no way an attempt to undermine the independence of the report," he 
said, noting that he was making no changes in the body of the study or its 
conclusions. 
</P>
<P>
 Strock said his memo does take issue with some of the project's conclusions, 
but he said his disagreements do not lessen the value of the project, which he 
said would play a prominent role in setting future agency priorities. 
</P>
<P>
 He also denied that his memo, which he has not released, is in response to a 
lengthy critique of the project by an industry lobbying group, the California 
Council for Environmental and Economic Balance. 
</P>
<P>
 Regarding the project as a recipe for runaway regulation of industry, the 
Council for Economic Balance said the work is rife with political rhetoric, its 
science of dubious value and its assertion that poor people and minority groups 
are at higher risk is never substantiated. 
</P>
<P>
 The project report admits that statewide data for minority "hot spots" do not 
exist and that "monitoring data to describe actual human exposures to most 
pollutants are also not available." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, in a supplementary section on environmental education, the 
report says: "The fact that poor people and people of color tend to live in 
areas that are more heavily polluted should be addressed in the classroom." 
</P>
<P>
 The state's business community wasn't alone in expressing skepticism about 
some aspects of the report. Even as it was being formulated, the part dealing 
with "peace of mind" invited comparison with the much-lampooned task force on 
self-esteem created four years ago by state Assemblyman John Vasconcellos 
(D-Santa Clara). 
</P>
<P>
 Even environmentalists who worked on the study worry that some of the more 
subjective aspects of it will detract from its overall value. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are some squishy areas that can make you a bit queasy. No doubt about 
that," said Lawrie Mott, a scientist with the Natural Resources Defense Council 
and a member of the advisory committee that reviewed the study. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Mott defended the effort to consider social welfare as part of the risk 
assessment project. 
</P>
<P>
 "The project was trying to find a way to integrate value judgments into risk 
assessment. It was another way of telling the regulatory agencies that there 
are other factors to consider besides statistics." 
</P>
<P>
 Mott and others emphasized the importance of moving beyond cancer studies as 
the only true measure of risk assessment. 
</P>
<P>
 "From the beginning, all of us said there is so much uncertainty about the 
(cancer) data, and it leaves out so much about other health hazards," said 
Carol Henry, who was the ranking EPA official assigned to the project until 
moving to the federal Department of Energy last March.  
</P>
<P>
 "In past studies, a whole range of non-cancer problems haven't been factored 
into risk assessment, " Henry said. "Reproductive, neurological, respiratory 
and other effects that may not have death as an end point. We show them to be a 
major concern in this study."

WELFARE PLAN CRACKS DOWN ON ABSENT PARENTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELIZABETH SHOGREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As part of the welfare reform package it plans to unveil next week, the 
Clinton Administration will propose a nationwide system to track down wayward 
parents who fail to pay child support and to garnish the wages of those who 
refuse to contribute voluntarily. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're all paying the price for the thousands and thousands of children 
growing up without the benefit of both parents," Bruce Reed, a senior domestic 
policy adviser to President Clinton and co-chairman of the White House welfare 
reform working group, said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 If the government were more successful at collecting child support, "we might 
not have a welfare crisis," Reed said. 
</P>
<P>
 The child-support enforcement measures in the President's welfare reform 
package are the toughest ever proposed, Reed said, and will cause many men to 
think twice before conceiving children out of wedlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Child-support enforcement is crucial to their overall plan, officials said, 
because single-parent families are much less likely to apply for welfare 
benefits if they are receiving child support and because money collected from 
absent parents would reduce welfare costs. 
</P>
<P>
 A report prepared by the working group shows that the current child-support 
system fails to collect $34 billion from non-custodial parents. Only 12% of the 
6.8 million absent parents whose children received welfare payments in 1992 
paid child support, according to Department of Health and Human Services 
statistics. 
</P>
<P>
 Because most fathers visit their newborn children in the hospital even if they 
are not married to the mother, the plan would require all hospitals to develop 
in-house procedures for establishing paternity. Paternity establishment is more 
important now than ever, officials said. As of 1992, 52% of people receiving 
Aid to Families With Dependent Children had never been married, up from only 
21% in 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 The initiative would also require employers to report the hiring of all new 
employees so that states could garnish the wages of deadbeat parents. It would 
also set up a national clearinghouse to track them across state lines. Drivers 
and professional licenses would be suspended if parents refuse to pay child 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 With these changes, government child-support collections could be more than 
doubled from $9 billion in 1993 to $20 billion five years after the program is 
begun, Administration officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The welfare crackdown is immensely popular politically, as indicated by the 
huge round of applause the President received when he denounced absent parents 
who fail to pay child support during his State of the Union Address last 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're not providing for your children, we'll garnish your wages, suspend 
your license, track you across state lines and, if necessary, make some of you 
work off what you owe. People who bring children into this world cannot and 
must not walk away from them," Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
 The overall welfare reform package is expected to be unveiled as early as 
Tuesday. A key goal of the plan is to turn welfare into a transitional system 
by limiting to two years the amount of time most people can collect benefits 
and by providing job training and placement services and offering child care 
for recipients who get jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure would maintain a safety net by allowing people who cannot find 
work a chance to continue receiving benefits after the two-year limit by 
working in a subsidized job. Administration officials expect that about 400,000 
people would need such jobs in the fifth year of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposal also would attempt to decrease teen-age pregnancy through a 
national campaign and by requiring teen-age parents to live with their own 
parents or guardians as a condition of receiving assistance. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the changes, except the child-support component, would apply only to 
recipients born after 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the elements of the child-support enforcement strategy in the 
Administration's plan have been implemented on a smaller scale by some states. 
</P>
<P>
 "What the proposal does is take the best of what states have been doing and 
make sure all the states are doing it," said Mary Jo Bane, an assistant 
secretary at the Department of Health and Human Services and a chief designer 
of the welfare reform plan. 
</P>
<P>
 In West Virginia, for instance, the state identified more than half of its 
unwed fathers last year under a new in-hospital paternity program. Once these 
fathers are identified, the state theoretically can collect from them. 
</P>
<P>
 Paternity establishment becomes more difficult if fathers are not identified 
soon after their children are born. In South Carolina, for instance, in the 
first 11 months of 1993, 37% of the 2,840 men identified as fathers by welfare 
mothers were excluded as possible parents by genetic testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Some welfare specialists said that while the proposals could markedly increase 
child-support collections from absent parents, any improvements in collections 
from fathers of children on welfare are likely to be slight because many of 
these fathers work unofficially or are unemployed. 
</P>
<P>
 Other welfare experts argued that the overall impact of the proposals will be 
negligible. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are good, solid ideas that no one will quarrel with," said Doug 
Besharov, a welfare specialist at the American Enterprise Institute, a 
conservative think tank. "But for none of them is there any evidence that they 
will make a major change in collections." 
</P>
<P>
 Besharov said it is naive to think that the "hospital gotcha" program will 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once we make it a nationwide practice to catch them there, they'll stop 
coming," he said. "A lot of us are disappointed that this has not been 
addressed with more candor for the social problems that underlie this problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Some fathers-rights advocates, meanwhile, charged that the efforts would push 
absent fathers further from their children. 
</P>
<P>
 "It treats fathers as cash cows whose only function is to pay money and get 
lost," said David Levy, the president of the National Council for Children's 
Rights, a group that fights for divorced parents' rights to be involved with 
their children. Child Support Failures 
</P>
<P>
 Tracking down wayward fathers is a central element of the Administration plan. 
HOW MUCH IS COLLECTED 
</P>
<P>
 Child-support payments fall about $34 billion short of what is potentially 
owed, the Administration says. A study found 10 million American women living 
with children without the father present. 
</P>
<P>
 Of potentially eligible mothers: 
</P>
<P>
 Awarded and received full amount: 26% 
</P>
<P>
 Awarded support but received less than ordered: 12% 
</P>
<P>
 Awarded support but received nothing: 12% 
</P>
<P>
 Awarded but not due in year of study: 8% 
</P>
<P>
 No support awarded: 42% PAYMENTS AWARDED AND RECEIVED BY MARITAL STATUS 
</P>
<P>
 Whether child support is received varies dramatically by marital status. 
Never-married mothers collect support far less often than other mothers. 
</P>
<P>
 Divorced: 
</P>
<P>
 Support awarded: 77% 
</P>
<P>
 Support received: 53% 
</P>
<P>
 Separated: 
</P>
<P>
 Support awarded: 48% 
</P>
<P>
 Support received: 31% 
</P>
<P>
 Never married:

PENA ASKS REVIEW OF FAA RESPONSE TO 757 WAKE ISSUE; AVIATION: TRANSPORTATION 
DEPARTMENT'S PROBE FOLLOWS REPORTS THAT THE AGENCY KNEW OF THE DANGER INVOLVING 
PLANES TRAILING TOO CLOSELY BEFORE CRASHES IN O.C., MONTANA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 U. S. Transportation Secretary Federico Pena on Friday ordered a review to 
determine whether the Federal Aviation Administration waited too long before 
instituting new safety rules designed to prevent accidents caused by wake 
turbulence from Boeing 757 jetliners. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement came five days after The Times, citing FAA internal 
documents, revealed that long before two aircraft accidents claimed 13 lives, 
the agency's top scientist warned that air turbulence created by the jetliners 
would cause a "major crash" if the agency failed to require smaller planes to 
maintain a greater distance behind 757s. 
</P>
<P>
 "Serious questions have been raised regarding the timeliness of the agency's 
actions over the past several years," Pena said in a statement. "This review 
will evaluate whether FAA has the proper procedures in place to ensure that we 
are apprised of safety concerns at the earliest possible time, so appropriate 
action can be taken in a timely way. 
</P>
<P>
 "The traveling public entrusts its safety to this department," he added. 
"Maintaining that trust and that responsibility is essential." 
</P>
<P>
 FAA scientist Robert E. Machol expressed concerns about the threat posed by 
the wake of 757s as far back as 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 But it wasn't until December -- after the crash of a private jetliner in Santa 
Ana claimed the lives of five people -- that FAA Administrator David R. Hinson 
issued a bulletin instructing air traffic controllers nationwide to routinely 
warn the pilots of smaller nearby aircraft of the hazard posed by the wake of 
757s. 
</P>
<P>
 Reacting to recommendations made in February by the National Transportation 
Safety Board, the FAA's Hinson announced in May an interim policy requiring 
controllers to increase from three miles to four the distance smaller planes 
should stay behind 757s during landings. 
</P>
<P>
 Although aviation experts disagree on the level of danger involved, the 
plane's unique, fuel-efficient design creates invisible "horizontal tornadoes" 
emanating from each wingtip that are more powerful and last longer than those 
made by other aircraft its size. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has maintained that there was insufficient data to warrant a rule 
change earlier. But the agency issued its new policy with no new data other 
than the two fatal crashes and three serious incidents or near misses in the 
past 18 months. 
</P>
<P>
 A statement issued Friday by Hinson said: "I share the secretary's concerns 
about the timeliness of the actions over the past several years regarding this 
issue, and the adequacy of the process used by the agency in considering those 
actions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public," Hinson said, "is entitled to be assured that the FAA has acted, 
and can act in the future, with appropriate speed when the facts warrant." 
</P>
<P>
 The review, to be completed by July 22, will also examine whether the FAA 
adhered to the provisions of the federal Freedom of Information Act when the 
agency was asked to make public information in its files on the 757 issue. 
</P>
<P>
 Although The Times asked for access to FAA documents on 757 wake turbulence 
under the federal law in January, it wasn't until May -- after the newspaper 
appealed one agency rejection -- that the FAA surrendered 226 pages of internal 
letters and memoranda, which showed that the agency knew about the 757 problem 
years ago from within its own ranks. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the documents provided by the FAA, The Times obtained from 
independent sources an Oct. 3, 1989, memo suggesting the agency was sensitive 
to public perceptions of the wake turbulence issue. 
</P>
<P>
 In the memo, addressed to two members of the FAA management staff, Machol 
wrote that he couldn't understand why there weren't more wake turbulence 
disasters, given the FAA's wake turbulence policies. Across the top of the 
memo, someone had scrawled: "Bob: A note of caution -- please watch your 
wording -- I don't want 'smoking guns' in our files." 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson has directed an agencywide review of responses to FOIA requests. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials said The Times' FOIA request appears to have been mishandled, 
though not deliberately, by lower-level employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Agency officials said the 757 wake turbulence review panel would be comprised 
of a small number of people from the FAA and the Transportation Department.  
</P>
<P>
 An agency official said the panel would ask: "When did the FAA know what it 
knew, how soon thereafter was it in a position to make a decision, and were 
those decisions made in a timely fashion?" 
</P>
<P>
 While it is not uncommon for the FAA to conduct its own reviews, agency 
officials said, it was unusual for Transportation Department officials to take 
part in such a review. 
</P>
<P>
 The Transportation Department is involved, one official said, to lend 
credibility to the review -- "so it doesn't look like the FAA looked at itself 
and said everything is all right." Leo Garodz, a former FAA manager who 
expressed concerns about 757 wake turbulence to the FAA in 1991 as a 
consultant, welcomed Friday's action. 
</P>
<P>
 "As I've said before, it sometimes takes a catastrophic event to get programs 
back on the front burner," Garodz said. "That's what happened here. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's frustrating," added Garodz, who was retained by the FAA in 1990 to test 
the level of 757 wake turbulence. "They hired me to do the wake vortex 
research. . . . We did it, we made recommendations, and nothing was done about 
it until now." 
</P>
<P>
 The 757, a twin-engine narrow-body jet praised by pilots for its handling and 
safety, has flown for more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 It is unclear to those in the aviation industry why accidents and incidents 
involving 757 turbulence are a relatively recent phenomenon. Some have 
suggested it is because there are many more 757s flying, and because commercial 
pilots are increasingly being pressured to cut delays, which can often mean 
following closer behind aircraft than is advised. 
</P>
<P>
 The wake turbulence hazard is greatest during landings and take-offs, when 
smaller planes on an approach can inadvertently fall below the 757's flight 
path and find itself entangled in a danger zone of hurricane-force winds. Even 
mid-sized passenger jets such as MD-80s, DC-9s and Boeing 737s, which can carry 
100 passengers or more, have been violently "rolled" when they encountered 757 
wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 Turbulence from 757s is suspected of playing a part in two crashes of small 
aircraft that were landing in the wake of the sleek-bodied jets. Eight people 
died in a Billings, Mont., crash on Dec. 18, 1992. And five people, including 
two executives from the In-N-Out Burger chain, died in a Dec. 15, 1993, 
accident in Santa Ana. Eleven days before the Billings crash, Machol attended a 
special meeting with the FAA's hierarchy and predicted a "catastrophe" due to 
757 wake turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has said both pilots were flying under visual flight rules, which 
require a pilot to maintain a safe distance from a leading aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 The FAA has resisted efforts to increase separation distances between large 
jets and tailing airplanes because it could potentially decrease the number of 
flights at the nation's busiest airports. That could cut into revenue of the 
already financially hard-hit airline industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Hinson said in Friday's statement the recently adopted four-mile separation 
and other 757 safety measures that take effect this summer "appropriately 
address safety issues" involving the 757. However, the agency has embarked on a 
two-year study of 757 wake turbulence to determine whether the four-mile 
separation distance is appropriate. 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Line Pilots Assn., the largest organization of pilots in the world, 
recently issued a bulletin advising pilots of smaller planes to stay five miles 
behind 757s to avoid the larger jet's wake. 
</P>
<P>
 The British equivalent of the FAA, the Civil Aviation Authority, also has 
recently increased separation behind 757s after a 10-year study at 
London-Heathrow Airport showed the 757 was the culprit in a disproportionate 
number of wake turbulence incidents. Aircraft in the United Kingdom must stay 
four to six miles behind 757s, depending on the size of the trailing plane.

 The explosion heard in the skies over Kigali at 9:40 on the night of April 6 
caused no great alarm. The capital had been tense for weeks, and the sounds of 
grenades and rifle fire hardly made anyone flinch anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nothing to worry about. Probably just thunder," Phillippe Lambiliotte, a 
Belgian businessman, reassured his wife. The night was thick with humidity and 
heat and more silent than usual. Lambiliotte remembers hearing a dog bark. He 
went to sleep wondering if someone was moving around in the dark. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone was, and by morning the disembowelment of a luckless country had 
begun. 
</P>
<P>
 Guided by government troops, gangs of young thugs with clubs, machetes and 
spears rampaged through Kigali, hunting down members of the Tutsi tribe that 
until the 1950s had ruled the rival Hutus for centuries as feudal overlords. 
</P>
<P>
 At first, they chose their targets selectively, matching addresses with names 
on lists they carried; then, exhilarated by their thoroughness, they began 
killing anyone they felt like killing. 
</P>
<P>
 While the government-sponsored radio station RTLM exhorted, "Kill the Tutsis 
or they will kill you," the organized gangs of marauders went block by block 
doing just that. 
</P>
<P>
 On one street corner, a Tutsi child lay wounded. A soldier shouted something 
to a woman nearby. She raised a club that bristled with protruding nails and 
sank it into the boy's skull. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel guilt for what I have done, but I must tell you I do not feel 
responsible," the woman, Muliana Mukanyarwaya, 36, later told reporters. "I was 
only carrying out orders." 
</P>
<P>
 It was not until noon on the first day of killing that the now-panicked 
populace of Rwanda learned that the nighttime thunderclap heard over Kigali was 
the explosion of President Juvenal Habyarimana's plane, struck by a rocket as 
it approached the airport. 
</P>
<P>
 His death in the resulting crash, African diplomats said, put into effect a 
master plan that in genocidal scope and intensity would rival the horrors of 
Pol Pot's Cambodia in the mid-1970s. 
</P>
<P>
 What has happened in Rwanda over the last two months -- several hundreds of 
thousands killed and 2 million made homeless -- may say no more about Africa as 
a whole than Bosnia does about Europe. Yet the tragedy could perhaps have been 
averted had Rwanda learned from the post-independence traumas of its neighbors: 
A security force whose allegiance is to a party or a tribe is a weapon that at 
some point will be used -- at whatever cost -- to subjugate the very people it 
is pledged to defend. 
</P>
<P>
 Most African armies, such as Rwanda's, are trained not to safeguard borders 
from external threats but to protect a ruling hierarchy. 
</P>
<P>
 They are, as happened here, tools of leaders unwilling to share power as the 
price for peace, because to share the spoils of authority, in a society once 
dominated by chiefs and kings, is to suffer the ultimate indignity of no longer 
being boss. 
</P>
<P>
 So every conflict -- such as that between the Hutus and Tutsis -- becomes a 
winner-take-all confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
 That is a suicidal course in countries like Rwanda, where political pluralism 
is a murky concept and the judicial system is paralyzed, offering the guilty no 
fear of prosecution and the aggrieved no hope of compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 The result is that violence becomes an authorized function of state, often 
"privatized" in the hands of party militias. 
</P>
<P>
 The first Tutsis who migrated to central Africa with their cattle, probably 
from the Nile, were tall and slim, with thin lips, high foreheads and aquiline 
noses. 
</P>
<P>
 Though a minority, the Tutsis ruled the short, stocky Hutus, a farming people 
of Bantu ethnicity, under a medieval system known as buhake , offering 
protection in return for a share of Hutu crops and services. Eventually buhake 
became synonymous with servitude. 
</P>
<P>
 Belgian colonialists reinforced the caste system by favoring the Tutsis in 
education, commerce, government and security. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1959, three years before independence, the Hutus overthrew their masters, 
killing an estimated 100,000 Tutsis. 
</P>
<P>
 The slaughters continued periodically for five years and prompted English 
philosopher Bertrand Russell to call them "the most horrible and systematic 
human massacre we have had occasion to witness since the extermination of the 
Jews by the Nazis." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, in neighboring Burundi, which had once been part of Rwanda, the 
Tutsi minority had come up with a solution to end ethnic competition. In 1972, 
it set out to kill every Hutu who had an education, a government job or money. 
</P>
<P>
 Within three months, the death toll reached 200,000. Hutu bodies were thrown 
into the uncovered cargo holds of military trucks and driven through Bujumbura 
in broad daylight until the capital had become as empty of Hutus as Warsaw was 
of Jews after World War II. 
</P>
<P>
 So subservient and obedient had the Hutus become to their Tutsi masters that 
they answered summonses to appear at local police stations, where much of the 
killing was taking place. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes when the death quotas had been filled, the police sent the Hutus 
home in the afternoon, with instructions to return the next day. Almost all 
did. 
</P>
<P>
 Today in Rwanda, it is the Tutsis who are the vulnerable ones, controlling 
neither the government nor the military. 
</P>
<P>
 By April 10, the violence had swept north, leaving flattened villages and 
murdered and maimed women and children in its wake before reaching this quiet 
little hillside town, a two-hour drive from Kigali. 
</P>
<P>
 The one-story stucco hospital in Gahini was built in 1927, at the end of a 
dirt road. 
</P>
<P>
 Rob Watson, a British doctor, was performing surgery in the operating room the 
evening the mob came up the road with its machetes. His Rwandan staff of nurses 
stood bravely at the door and tried to face down the wild-eyed assailants with 
words of reason. They were pushed aside. 
</P>
<P>
 As calmly as if they were on a mission to visit the ill, the young killers 
went from bed to bed, looking for anyone with Tutsi features. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the name of God . . . " a nurse said. One of the youths ignored her and 
plunged his machete into the stomach of a female patient. 
</P>
<P>
 One group tried to barge into the operating room, but Watson put his shoulder 
against the door and managed to lock it. Later, the surgery successfully 
completed, he entered the courtyard where the killers were still milling about, 
and he had a chilling realization: He knew these men. They were the jobless 
youths he passed almost every day, the idle ones in Gahini who always looked so 
bored and so in need of something to do. 
</P>
<P>
 According to numerous Rwandans interviewed here and in Tanzania, the youths 
recruited by Habyarimana's National Republican Movement for Democracy and 
Development to help the army and presidential guard carry out the massacres 
were formed into two groups: the Interahamwe (Those Who Stand Together) and the 
Impuza Mugambi (The Single-Minded Ones). 
</P>
<P>
 They were paid $3.50 a day and were drawn from the ranks of the uneducated, 
unemployed young men who hang out on the street corners of all African cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Their presence is worrisome to every African nation, and none more so than 
this unfortunate place best known, until April 6, as the home of the late 
naturalist Dian Fossey (who was murdered here) and some of the last mountain 
gorillas on Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 In a "dual society" such as Rwanda's, with only two ethnic groups vying for 
power, idleness combined with overcrowding and other obstacles to development 
can be a prescription for hatred at close quarters, says Ali Mazrui, an African 
political scientist. 
</P>
<P>
 With nearly 8 million people, Rwanda is the world's most densely populated 
nation. It had, before the recent foreign exodus, five times more missionaries 
(903) than physicians (177). It has the highest birthrate in the world, with 
each woman bearing an average of 8.6 children. Life expectancy is 47 years, and 
of every 1,000 Rwandans born, 189 will die before they turn 5. One-third of the 
adults in Kigali, the World Health Organization says, are believed to have what 
is referred to in Rwanda as "the famous disease" -- AIDS. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, by the mid-1980s, Rwanda was being hailed by the World Bank as a 
model African country. 
</P>
<P>
 It had made economic reforms, and Habyarimana, who had seized power in a 1973 
coup, was paying at least lip service to the need for ethnic conciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 John Blane, the U.S. ambassador here in 1982-85, managed to get Rwanda special 
U.S. economic development funds as a reward for its progress. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found the Rwandans to be the nicest, sweetest, most inoffensive people I've 
ever met," Blane said by telephone from Washington. "I didn't feel there was 
any nastiness in them at all. I never would have suspected something like this 
could happen. Oh sure, I heard some Tutsi complaints that they weren't getting 
a fair share, but those complaints were never at a very high pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 When Oscar and Eugenia Giordano, an American couple, arrived in Rwanda in 1991 
on their first African missionary assignment, they remember seeing their new 
home in Mugonero, 100 miles south of Kigali, and thought that they had reached 
paradise. The hospital and church each stood on small hills, and in the valley 
between them was their house, its porch offering a superb view of Lake Kivu 
below. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, in the middle of April, three years later, Oscar Giordano was careening 
alone in his Trooper away from Kigali, where he had been trapped by the 
fighting, and back to his hospital and wife. He remembered the eerily prophetic 
words of a sermon he had delivered just days earlier: "If you want to give your 
life to Jesus, this might be your last opportunity." 
</P>
<P>
 In the last 20 miles of his journey, through a valley in the shadow of death, 
he saw in the approaching darkness not a car, not a person, not a light. 
</P>
<P>
 "Never before, in three years, have I seen an African road with nobody on it," 
he said. But in Mugonero a welcome sight awaited him: The hospital, the church, 
his home and wife and three daughters were safe. 
</P>
<P>
 A menacing gang of 60 or 70 men had approached the hospital the day before 
with machetes. They had come to the dirt road in front of the compound, then 
miraculously turned back. 
</P>
<P>
 The night of Giordano's return, grenades were thrown into the compound, and 
the next morning the Giordanos packed four small suitcases and joined a convoy 
of Swiss and French nationals to Zaire, leaving behind the hospital where the 
two doctors and their staff of 75 Rwandans had cared last year for 20,000 
patients, conducted 980 operations and delivered 405 babies. Their last 
communications with the staff was by telephone at 4 p.m. on April 13. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're coming to attack us again!" shouted the voice on the other end of the 
line. "They're coming again now!" 
</P>
<P>
 In retrospect, the Giordanos now know, it had been clear for some time that 
the framework was being built for Rwanda's ultimate moment of horror. 
</P>
<P>
 Since October, 1990, when the Tutsi-dominated Rwandan Patriotic Front had 
launched a civil war, Africa Watch and other human rights organizations had 
documented the deaths of hundreds of innocents -- mostly Tutsis and members of 
political parties opposed to Habyarimana -- and had called for urgent reforms 
and a halt to the arming of civilians. 
</P>
<P>
 The ill-disciplined, often drunken army had gotten so out of hand that 
Habyarimana -- who frequently had denied that his military was guilty of any 
excesses -- called senior commanders together in Ruhengeri in March, 1993, and 
said, "It is always a bitter experience for me to have to castigate certain 
soldiers for their behavior; they are not many, but how destructive are their 
actions when they abuse innocent people by pillage, rape and all kinds of 
vandalism." 
</P>
<P>
 Five months later, in Arusha, Tanzania, Habyarimana signed a peace agreement 
with the rebels designed to lead to a broad-based transitional government and 
democratic elections. 
</P>
<P>
 That accord may have sealed the president's fate, and Rwanda's. His 
assassination and the chaos that followed, it is widely believed, were the work 
of extremists in his own party who believed that Habyarimana had "gone soft on 
the Tutsi problem" and who were determined to derail the Arusha Accords. 
</P>
<P>
 The extremists are primarily Hutus from the north, the home region of 
Habyarimana's Bushin clan. They are at odds with both the Tutsis and the more 
moderate southern Hutus who favor ethnic power-sharing. 
</P>
<P>
 Benedict Ndagijimana, a college freshman majoring in English, is among the 
hundreds of thousands of Rwandans to flee the extremists and their mindless 
youth militias. Many of his friends are dead. He is not sure his parents 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
 For the last two weeks of his monthlong flight to Tanzania, he hid in bushes 
and foraged for food. His clothes were so badly ripped by thorns and vines that 
he was left nearly naked. He felt, he said, that he had returned to the Africa 
of a century ago. 
</P>
<P>
 By mid-May, Ndagijimana had reached safety in Tanzania's Benaco refugee camp 
-- part of what the United Nations said was the "fastest, youngest" exodus of 
people across a border in modern times. Dressed in tattered, secondhand 
clothes, he had gone in a month's time from being a member of the privileged 
elite to some undefined status below the bottom rung on the class scale. 
</P>
<P>
 How could this happen? he was asked: "It is not complicated. People who cannot 
read and do not have access to television believe what the government tells 
them on the radio. That becomes truth. They hear over and over that the Tutsis 
are out to kill them, and that is reality. So they act not (so much) out of 
hate as fear. They think they have only the choice to kill or be killed." 
</P>
<P>
 And what of Rwanda? 
</P>
<P>
 "Rwanda is dead," he said. "For my generation at least." 
</P>

CLINTON TARGETS HAITI'S ELITE WITH NEW CURBS; SANCTIONS: FLIGHTS TO U.S., 
FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS ARE BANNED IN EFFORT TO PRESSURE SUPPORTERS OF THE 
JUNTA. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 President Clinton tightened sanctions against Haiti on Friday with a ban on 
commercial flights and financial transactions between the two countries -- 
steps likely to punish Haiti's prosperous elite but to have little direct 
effect on its ruling junta. 
</P>
<P>
 Supplementing measures enacted nearly a month ago, Clinton announced a ban on 
commercial flights beginning June 25. The move is expected to halt at least 
two-thirds of scheduled air trips to and from Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The prohibition on transactions is intended to suspend wire transfers of cash, 
trade financing and even the carrying of cash from the United States to the 
Caribbean nation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message is simple: Democracy must be restored, the coup must not endure," 
Clinton said at a White House briefing. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly afterward, the State Department said it is withdrawing embassy 
dependents and some employees from Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 It urged private U.S. citizens who are not affiliated with humanitarian 
programs to leave as soon as possible. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly said about 120 Americans will 
leave and 80 will stay. 
</P>
<P>
 She said the action is being taken because the unstable situation has the 
potential for random violence. 
</P>
<P>
 The flight ban announced by Clinton includes exemptions for humanitarian 
missions that have been organized to support the feeding of about 1 million 
Haitians. 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, to enable Haitian Americans to continue to support their families 
in Haiti, the sanctions will permit them to send $50 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Since members of the Haitian military have already had their travel restricted 
and assets frozen, the new sanctions are directed at a Haitian civilian elite 
that is assumed to support the junta. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis here is . . . to apply pressure to those groups that are 
supporting the coup leadership," said William H. Gray III, Clinton's special 
envoy to Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 But observers in the United States and Haiti said that many of those Haitians 
have already moved their assets to third countries, such as the Cayman Islands. 
Many have also stockpiled goods on the island for their own survival and 
comfort. 
</P>
<P>
 The travel ban is likely to come as a shock, at least at first, for the 
better-off Haitians who continue to travel, observers said. 
</P>
<P>
 One Haitian businessman predicted that the flight ban will have a "deep 
psychological impact" on Haitians who "have developed the idea that they have a 
right to go to Miami for recreation and to do business." 
</P>
<P>
 But he and others were skeptical that the ban will create pressure that would 
move the military to give up control. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are in this to the finish," the businessman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernest Preeg, a former U.S. ambassador to Haiti, said it is doubtful that such 
pressure will prompt the army to give up power. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're desperate. If it all falls apart, their lives will be at risk," said 
Preeg, now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite such outside skepticism, U.S. officials emphasized their belief that 
the steps would work, if only indirectly. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said that while sanctions "don't solve any crisis," he believes that they 
will "create the kind of atmosphere where we can have a diplomatic breakthrough 
and a solution where the coup leaders will step down." 
</P>
<P>
 White House officials recently have played down the likelihood of a U.S. 
invasion to restore exiled President Jean-Bertrand Aristide, who was ousted by 
a military coup in September, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 But by declaring that they fully expect these steps to force change, U.S. 
officials have preserved the option of later declaring that the failure of a 
measured response had compelled them to turn to a military solution. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said that recent efforts to tighten the economic embargo are showing 
signs of success. An increase in gasoline prices, he said, showed that efforts 
to close down the smuggling from the Dominican Republic are beginning to take 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said they did not impose the flight ban immediately in order to 
allow those wanting to leave Haiti to do so in orderly fashion. 
</P>
<P>
 American Airlines, one of the chief U.S. air carriers to Haiti, has added 
extra flights. 
</P>
<P>
 About a third of all commercial flights to and from Haiti will not be directly 
affected by the U.S. suspension. Most of these are by Air France, the rest by 
Canadian and Dutch airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Canada said Friday that it will suspend commercial flights June 25. Gray said 
U.S. officials expect that the other countries will consider whether to follow 
suit. 
</P>
<P>
 Gray said the exemption for small amounts of cash will provide a lifeline for 
people abroad who help support family and friends in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're talking about a society where annual income is about $350, ($50) 
is a significant amount," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the United States intends to continue its humanitarian aid to Haiti -- 
now totaling about $75 million -- though Haitian thugs have seized about $12 
million of it. 
</P>
<P>
 Air cargo service and charter flights to and from Haiti are already prohibited 
under a U.N. trade embargo that took effect May 21. A U.N. oil embargo has been 
in effect since last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Tuesday, the Organization of American States banned commercial flights 
and financial transactions between its members and Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Preeg, the former ambassador, said the flight ban will also make life 
significantly riskier for the 10,000 foreigners, many of them charity workers, 
who remain in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 Richter reported from Washington and Freed from Miami.

RAMS READY FOR FLURRY OF TALKS ABOUT MOVING

 The Rams' search for a new home picked up momentum Friday when a team 
executive met for the second time with a key Baltimore official and announced 
upcoming meetings or discussions with St. Louis and Hartford representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not dealing exclusively with Baltimore," said John Shaw, Ram executive 
vice president. "St. Louis, Baltimore and Hartford are all very interested in 
pursuing the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a meeting later this month with the political interests in St. Louis, 
and we have already met with the ownership group there. We will be talking to 
Hartford, too, although nothing is scheduled." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw, while declining to reveal their identities, said he also has been 
approached by several Los Angeles groups in recent weeks. The Rams played 34 
years in Los Angeles before moving to Anaheim Stadium in 1980. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are looking for ways to keep us here, and have talked about building a 
stadium," Shaw said. "They are serious, but I don't know how competitive they 
can be because they are talking about private funds, and the cities we have 
been talking to have public funds to construct a stadium." 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said the Rams have not been approached by any California city offering 
public funds for the construction of a stadium. He said he has had no recent 
talks with the Anaheim officials, but expects the city to come forward for 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore, St. Louis and Hartford have offered to build new stadiums with 
public funds, and Peter Angelos, the baseball Baltimore Orioles' majority owner 
who is also attempting to purchase a National Football League team, met with 
Shaw in Los Angeles Friday to discuss a deal. Angelos was accompanied by his 
attorney, George Stamas. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw and team owner Georgia Frontiere met Angelos for the first time May 12 in 
Los Angeles. Frontiere said she is willing to sell a minority interest in the 
Rams to facilitate a move, and last month's informal get-together was staged to 
allow the parties to get to know each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said Friday's meeting with Angelos and Stamas dealt with a number of 
issues but did not involve specific financial terms for a move to Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Stamas' presence is believed to be significant. The Baltimore-based 
attorney, who specializes in mergers and acquisitions, was the driving force 
behind Angelos' purchase of the Orioles for $173 million last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had those kind of presentations and terms from other cities, but this 
was an overall look at the situation," Shaw said. "They were negotiations, yes, 
to explore the potential for a move to Baltimore. But it's a very difficult 
transaction and there are a still a number of issues on the table. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all exploratory, and I don't anticipate a decision soon." 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore investment group, which includes Angelos, author Tom Clancy and 
former Oriole President Larry Lucchino, would ideally like to purchase 100% of 
a franchise, but Angelos said the group would also buy a minority interest in 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to buy all of a team, but if someone wants to work down, fine," 
Angelos said in an interview last week. "If a team wants to sell 40-50%, I 
would consider that collateral to bringing it to Baltimore. If a franchise 
moves here, its financial success is absolutely guaranteed." 
</P>
<P>
 Baltimore has offered to build a $160-million, 72,000-seat stadium with 108 
skyboxes and 7,500 club seats next to Oriole Park at Camden Yards. It would be 
financed by a mixture of tax-free bonds, stadium revenue and special lotteries. 
</P>
<P>
 All revenues from tickets, skyboxes, club seats, parking and concessions would 
go to the team, which would have the option of paying for stadium maintenance 
and operating costs in exchange for no rent, or paying a percentage of income 
in exchange for free stadium maintenance and operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Sources familiar with Baltimore's stadium lease project that a team could net 
about $15 million to $20 million a year in profits. The Rams, who have been 
plagued by four consecutive losing seasons and dwindling attendance, made a 
profit of about $3.5 million last year, and Shaw projects a substantial loss in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 The Baltimore group has reportedly offered to buy the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for 
$200 million. Stamas, reached at his Los Angeles hotel, declined to comment on 
Friday's meeting with the Rams. But he did say in an interview last week that 
he has had discussions with at least two other teams, besides the Rams and 
Buccaneers. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's like three-dimensional chess," Stamas said of Baltimore's attempt to buy 
an NFL team. "We're looking at several opportunities, and each one of those 
opportunities is looking at several opportunities. We'd love to be a part of 
the Rams organization. John Shaw and Georgia Frontiere are terrific people," 
Stamas said. 
</P>
<P>
 Angelos said he is confident that the Rams are not merely using Baltimore for 
leverage to get a better deal, either in Anaheim or elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis and Hartford also are offering lucrative deals. A $258-million, 
70,000-seat domed stadium, with 101 skyboxes and 6,550 club seats, is under 
construction in St. Louis and is scheduled to be completed in 1995. It's being 
paid for with state and local government-backed bonds. 
</P>
<P>
 All concession, in-house advertising, skybox and club seat revenue would go to 
the team, which would pay $250,000 per year in rent. About $75,000 in game-day 
expenses would be paid for, though. 
</P>
<P>
 House Majority Leader Richard A. Gephardt (D-Mo) announced in St. Louis Friday 
that he will lead a local delegation to meet Ram officials June 27 in Los 
Angeles. The group will include St. Louis Mayor Freeman Bosley Jr. and St. 
Louis County Executive George (Buzz) Westfall. 
</P>
<P>
 There has also been some progress in settling a stadium-lease dispute that, to 
this point, has paralyzed the city's efforts to negotiate with NFL teams. 
</P>
<P>
 James Orthwein, former New England Patriots owner, agreed Friday to turn over 
his 65% of the lease to FANS Inc. (Football At the New Stadium), a nonprofit 
group formed by Westfall and Bosley that has been working to move the lease 
into neutral hands. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Clinton, a St. Louis beer distributor and aspiring NFL owner, still 
controls 30% of the lease and has been seeking some $8 million to relinquish 
his share. City officials had previously offered $3.5 million, and an agreement 
has not been reached. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials also confirmed Friday that Stan Kroenke, a Missouri businessman 
who headed the Gateway Group's failed bid for a St. Louis expansion team last 
fall, has had discussions with Rams officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Connecticut Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. has reportedly had two discussions with 
Shaw regarding a possible move to Hartford, where the state Legislature has 
authorized $252 million in general obligation bonds for construction of a 
70,000-seat, 140-skybox stadium and an adjoining practice facility. 
</P>
<P>
 The team would receive all revenue from concessions, parking, skyboxes, club 
seats and in-house advertising but would pay $4.9 million annual rent.

 LOVIN' CALIFORNIA: Romanian soccer team members exercised this week at the 
Newport Beach Athletic Club, and if they never win a World Cup match, they've 
had a lot of fun. . . . The StairMaster was a hoot to them, and local gymnasts 
had fun watching them try to convert pounds into kilos at the scales. But, says 
manager Bill Spurgeon: "They had a fantastic time trying everything, splashing 
in the Jacuzzi. They were like little kids. It was great."

 COPWATCHERS? Local police agencies have created a brouhaha, and a lawsuit, by 
photographing young people who dress or look like gang members. There's a forum 
about it at 1 p.m. today at a Vietnamese community center, 15361 Brookhurst St. 
in Westminster. Speakers on "Guilt by Appearance" include lawyers who filed the 
class-action suit, parents and students. . . . Says forum spokesman Dan Tsang, 
"Many young people photographed were afraid to come forward before." 
</P>
<P>
 ON HOLD: Vietnamese American activist Mai Cong will attend a White House 
reception Monday for Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko. Cong, 
president of Vietnamese Community of Orange County, a nonprofit social service 
group, says "It is an honor for me, a Vietnamese American, to have received 
this invitation." . . . But she told the White House at first: "I'm honored, 
but let me check my calendar and call you back." 
</P>

 SOBER FOOTWORK: When members of the Placentia-based Dance Precisions were 
looking for a worthwhile charity for their annual fund-raiser, they didn't have 
to look far. Kathy Hamill, mother of 8-year-old dance member Brittany, is also 
active in Orange County Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD). The 80-girl team 
chose that group to benefit from its show tonight at the Cerritos Center for 
the Performing Arts. . . . "I was surprised, but think it's great," says 
Hamill. Next up for MADD: A campaign promoting its new cartoon character, Sober 
Man.

 NO CONTEST: What's wrong with some honest competition? Well, at Saugus High 
School, apparently quite a bit. The school won't honor a valedictorian this 
year, saying it simply places too much pressure on students (B9). . . . But 
Canyon High's Gerald Calderon, 18, the only valedictorian left in the same 
school district, couldn't disagree more. He says the race for the best grades 
is a "very good idea." 
</P>
<P>
 OUR WELFARE: The White House will offer its new welfare package next week 
(A1), and it's sure to get plenty of attention in the Valley. In fact, 
according to the county Social Services Department, about 145,000 people in the 
Valley receive AFDC benefits. . . . "We're always trying to find more space in 
that area because of the growing population on welfare," said Sandra Semtner, a 
department official. 
</P>
<P>
 TERROR RIDE: Working for a security firm, Jim Voshall makes his living off the 
dread of crime. Fear came home to him when two men climbed into his car at 
gunpoint and talked casually of killing him (B1). . . . "I was going to die and 
my son was going to grow up without a dad," said Voshall, recounting how he 
tearfully pleaded for his life. 
</P>
<P>
 FAN SUPPORT: Six days and counting until the World Cup (C1), time for the U.S. 
to get behind its soccer squad. That's the view of Dave Wynalda of Westlake 
Village, and no wonder. His son, Eric, plays for the team, and Dad isn't 
thrilled with the lack of fan support. . . . "I feel strongly that fans can 
take the team a long way," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 NEW APPROACH: Atheists, of course, don't believe in organized religion. But 
they do believe in organizing themselves (B11). . . . For Atheists United in 
Sherman Oaks, that means expanding its radio show and seeking a more positive 
image. "Secular people are just as concerned about ethics and values as 
religious people are," says a group leader in today's Valley religion column.

 For the last 4 1/2 months, Yugoslavia's 10 million citizens have been enjoying 
a respite from the rigors of 2-year-old U.N. sanctions, including an oil 
embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, more cars are cruising the streets of this capital than at any time 
since the sanctions were imposed to punish the Belgrade government for its role 
in the violent partition of neighboring Bosnia-Herzegovina. 
</P>
<P>
 Hyper-inflation, once raging at an annual rate estimated at 300,000,000%, has 
all but disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least I no longer have to race around like a maniac trying to spend my 
salary before it evaporates," said Bojana Popovic, a saleswoman at a Belgrade 
bookstore. "It is a psychological boost. I no longer spend all my time trying 
to think up ways to find and buy basic essentials." 
</P>
<P>
 With her monthly salary equal to about $50, roughly the national average, 
Popovic once had to act fast to spend any dinars left in her wallet because 
they lost value by the hour. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now . . . I know that my dinar will be worth the same tomorrow," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The credit, Popovic and others say, goes to an emergency fiscal program 
introduced Jan. 25 by Central Bank Director Dragoslav Avramovic that pegged a 
new dinar to the deutsche mark at a one-for-one level. 
</P>
<P>
 Avramovic, who once worked for the World Bank in Washington, boasts that the 
country's foreign exchange reserves, which stood at $195 million in January, 
have risen by half. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have actually overcome the blockade. Yugoslavia can no longer be 
blackmailed with sanctions; the blockade and sanctions are now secondary 
problems," he crowed. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, Yugoslavia's Serbian leadership has never been so self-confident since 
sanctions went into force, say Western diplomats based here. The economic 
situation has improved to such an extent that diplomats worry that Serbian 
leaders will be less likely to meet international demands and make concessions 
to their Bosnian Muslim foes. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Avramovic is hailed as his country's savior, credited for bringing 
food back to the grocery shelves and filling up barren department stores with 
clothes and other consumer goods. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, however, say the availability of consumer goods owes more to a vast 
network of criminals and smugglers than fiscal management. And gloomy Belgrade 
economists and businessmen say the good times are a temporary phenomenon, fed 
in part by public confidence in the new dinar. 
</P>
<P>
 The economy of Yugoslavia, which now is made up of just Serbia and Montenegro, 
has been devastated not only by the sanctions but the cost of waging nearly 
three years of war, economists say. The annual budget deficit of $1.5 billion 
represents an awesome obstacle to true recovery, and continuing support for the 
forces of Serbian rebels in Bosnia remains a great burden.  
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics suggest that while Avramovic has succeeded in stopping the printing 
presses at the national mint, credits are being issued instead. 
</P>
<P>
 Milutin Mitrovic, editor of Ekonomska Politika, an independent economic 
magazine, points to hidden inflation, saying, "Businessmen have taken out 
credits but are unlikely to pay them back, which will mean a return of 
inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is a game of smoke and mirrors. The stores are stocked, but with last 
year's products," said a Belgrade businessman speaking on condition of 
anonymity.  
</P>
<P>
 While Serbian officials point to growth in industrial production over the last 
four months as evidence of long-term success, economists say that improvement 
is still far below the pre-sanctions level. The rise was 3% in April, according 
to official statistics, a disappointment after March's 24% rise. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is no miracle," said Ivan Vujacic, an economist at Belgrade University. 
"After hyper-inflation is stopped, it is always followed by a jump in 
production." 
</P>
<P>
 Economists predict that by September, the program will cave in, unable to meet 
all the demands. 
</P>
<P>
 "For me, it's just a question of whether it will collapse in June or 
September. Quite simply, there is no way that they can pay for this year's 
wheat harvest," the businessman said.

ASIA; FILM-STAR FAMOUS, INDIAN REFORMER IS FACING A FALL; THE PUBLIC LOVES 
CRUSADING ELECTION OFFICIAL T.N. SESHAN. BUT HIS IMPERIOUS WAYS HAVE IRKED THE 
RULING PARTY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN-THOR DAHLBURG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The rogue elephant of Indian politics is, it seems, about to be de-tusked. 
</P>
<P>
 Central Election Commissioner T.N. Seshan is the only occupant of his office 
to have enforced tough controls on political campaigning and spending. He has 
tried to eliminate the advantages enjoyed by incumbents by, for instance, 
limiting the number of cars in campaign motorcades. 
</P>
<P>
 This crusading, sharp-tongued Brahmin from south India has become the hero of 
the country's middle classes, who had despaired of being able to rid politics 
of corruption, nepotism and other malpractices. But there are signs that the 
former career civil servant with imperious ways has overplayed his hand. 
</P>
<P>
 "He has struck the fear of God into all parties," comments Vinod Mehta, editor 
of the influential Pioneer newspaper. "All of them think they will be the 
gainers if they see the back of this chap." 
</P>
<P>
 Mehta believes that public adoration may have gone to Seshan's head, paving 
the way to what could be his downfall. "I went to a public function and was 
amazed at the number of people queuing up for his autograph," Mehta said. "He's 
like a film star." 
</P>
<P>
 Such acclaim, Mehta says, may have made the 61-year-old Seshan an "autocrat." 
Last month, he postponed six partial elections in the state of Uttar Pradesh 
until September because the chief minister there, Mulayam Singh Yadav, 
improperly used a government helicopter to campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 The Supreme Court, which had told Seshan to cool his often-acerbic public 
rhetoric a few weeks earlier, quickly ruled that he had exceeded his powers and 
ordered the election held as soon as possible. Voters went to the polls May 31. 
</P>
<P>
 The knives are out for Seshan in the ruling Congress-I Party, because before 
he took the job in December, 1990, chief election commissioners had been docile 
servants of their political masters. Because Seshan holds a constitutional 
office, he cannot be fired. Now his foes have come up with a new gambit. 
</P>
<P>
 There are now two other election commissioners, but only the chief is 
empowered by the constitution. Congress leaders want to amend the document to 
give the other commissioners, who are harmless ciphers, the same theoretical 
powers as Seshan and to require that all decisions be taken by a majority. 
Seshan will then be outnumbered. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling party has a simple majority in Parliament but needs a two-thirds 
majority to amend the constitution. Parleys are going on with opposition 
forces, although the largest, the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party, 
mindful of Seshan's enormous middle-class support, has taken the chief 
commissioner's side. 
</P>
<P>
 The first shot will likely be fired when Indian lawmakers assemble Monday for 
a special brief session to allow the introduction of a bill on election law 
"reforms." 
</P>
<P>
 Seshan has refused to be cowed. Alluding to his considerable girth, he has 
said: "I have been in this dieting business for years. I haven't been able to 
cut my size. How can anyone else cut my size? That's impossible." 
</P>
<P>
 Mehta believes that if Congress and other parties succeed in diluting his 
powers, Seshan will quit and run for political office. But whoever succeeds 
him, he says, will be very conscious that "he is sitting in Seshan's chair."

AIR FORCE CHIEF, SERGEANT WHO ALLEGES SEX HARASSMENT TO MEET 
</P>

 Air Force Secretary Sheila Widnall will meet privately with a female Air Force 
sergeant who said her superiors threatened her career over a taxi cab voucher 
days after she testified before Congress about being sexually harassed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have asked to meet with her to learn directly from her the details of her 
concerns and how the Air Force leadership can address them," Widnall said 
Friday.A meeting was set for Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Sgt. Zenaida Martinez, a military police officer based at Mildenhall Air Force 
Base in Britain, filed a formal complaint Thursday with the Defense Department 
inspector general's office, claiming that the most recent action by her 
superiors violates a federal whistle-blower protection law. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only possible reason for these actions by the Air Force is in reprisal 
for giving my testimony to the House Armed Services Committee," Martinez said 
in an affidavit accompanying her complaint. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez, 27, appeared at a March 9 hearing of the committee along with three 
other military women. All told of on-the-job sexual harassment and of 
retaliation by superiors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the Air Force has really blown it on this one," said Rep. Patricia 
Schroeder (D-Colo.), a member of the Armed Services Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 In her affidavit, Martinez says that on her return to Britain from Washington, 
she took a $200 cab ride back to Mildenhall after being told that the last 
military bus had left. The Air Force reimbursed her for the fare. But her 
superiors, one of whom is charged in her lawsuit with retaliating for her 
sexual-harassment complaints, questioned Martinez. 
</P>
<P>
 Among other things, they demanded details of her discussions with her 
attorneys in Washington. Last week, base officials reportedly told Martinez 
that she was the subject of a "criminal" investigation over the taxi voucher.

SENATE PANEL'S DEFENSE BILL INCLUDES SPY PLANE FUNDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Senate Armed Services Committee approved a $263-billion defense 
authorization bill Friday, including money that might put the SR-71 spy plane 
back in operation to watch North Korea's nuclear program. 
</P>
<P>
 The authorization for next year's defense spending also would keep more 
bombers than President Clinton wants for fighting two Persian Gulf-type wars at 
nearly the same time, and hold out the hope of buying more B-2 Stealth bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 Chairman Sam Nunn (D-Ga.) said the committee added $100 million to the bill 
for the SR-71 spy plane and said it might be used to watch what U.S. officials 
say is North Korea's attempt to produce nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "Particularly with the Korean situation that we face, the SR-71 could be 
useful," Nunn said. "We hope it will not be required in that situation but it 
could be useful." 
</P>
<P>
 Senate sources said the money would fund a study on putting three of the spy 
planes back into operation. The Air Force retired them in 1990 because of high 
flying costs. 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn said the bill would also keep 190 U.S. bombers flying next year, and 
preserve an option for buying more B-2 bombers. He said he may lose a fight for 
more bombers in the full Senate, but added he would rather do that than "sit 
back and do nothing on it and end up with a Korean (war) situation where all of 
a sudden everybody realizes we don't have enough bombers for two scenarios." 
</P>
<P>
 Nunn said at least 185 bombers would be needed to fight two wars at the same 
time. But he noted that a Clinton Administration plan would eventually cut the 
U.S. bomber force to about 100. 
</P>
<P>
 The most controversial bomber provision in the bill is $150 million to keep 
Northrop Corp.'s full B-2 bomber production line open another year in case 
Congress and the Administration decide to build more of the bombers. 
</P>
<P>
 Congress declared last year that no more than 20 of the bombers are to be 
built, primarily because of their high cost of $44 billion, or $2.2 billion per 
plane. Northrop has said it could build 20 more B-2 bombers for $12 billion, 
raising the total cost to $56 billion but cutting the cost per plane to $1.4 
billion. 
</P>
<P>
 The Senate bill also includes $2.2 billion for President Clinton's request for 
six C-17 military transport planes built by McDonnell Douglas Corp.

 Sudanese rebels have hijacked a relief aid barge steaming down the White Nile,

<P>
 Spokesman Joe Sills said radio contact with the barge, filled with food, was 
lost four days ago as it attempted to deliver relief supplies to people living 
in both government and Sudanese People Liberation Army-controlled areas. 
U.N.-leased planes subsequently spotted the barge and confirmed that the U.N. 
staff was being held prisoner.

CHINA FLOUTS NUCLEAR MORATORIUM WITH TEST; ASIA: UNDERGROUND EXPLOSION HAD BEEN 
DELAYED UNTIL U.S. RENEWED ITS FAVORED TRADING STATUS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONE TEMPEST, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time in eight months, China defied an international moratorium 
on nuclear testing by setting off an underground nuclear explosion Friday at a 
remote site in western China. 
</P>
<P>
 The blast -- estimated by seismologists to be of medium yield, 10 to 60 
kilotons -- had been predicted for weeks by U.S. and Japanese intelligence 
agencies, which spotted preparations under way for the test at Lop Nor in 
Xinjiang province. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chinese government delayed the test until after the June 4 deadline set by 
President Clinton for renewal of most-favored-nation trading status for China. 
Despite objections from human rights organizations, Clinton authorized the 
renewal in late May. 
</P>
<P>
 Ironically, the test Friday was conducted at the same time the Chinese 
leadership was being urged by the United States and other countries to take a 
leading role in pressuring North Korea to allow international inspections of 
its nuclear facilities, where many fear Pyongyang has an embryonic nuclear 
weapons program. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Chinese leaders met with North Korean army Chief of Staff 
Choi Gwang and, separately, with South Korean Foreign Minister Han Sung Joo in 
an effort to resolve the crisis over North Korea's refusal to allow 
international inspection of its nuclear facilities. Japanese Foreign Minister 
Koji Kakizawa arrives Sunday for similar discussions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a break with tradition, China announced the test itself. In an official 
release, the government said it will continue to participate in negotiations 
with other nuclear powers seeking a comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia Lewis, director of the Verification Technology Information Center in 
London, a nuclear proliferation watchdog organization, said the Chinese test 
"could set back comprehensive nuclear test ban talks by months." 
</P>
<P>
 "It will also strengthen the hand of hard-liners in France who are pushing for 
a resumption of nuclear testing in the Pacific," Lewis said. 
</P>
<P>
 The test, China's second since Oct. 5, 1993, threatened to disrupt the fragile 
moratorium on nuclear testing established by the United States, France and 
Russia in 1992 when they began talks seeking a comprehensive test ban 
agreement. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, China joined with the other powers in talks in Geneva seeking a 
test ban treaty by 1995. In its news release Friday announcing the test, the 
Chinese government said it still "supports the conclusion of such treaty no 
later than 1996." 
</P>
<P>
 Western military experts have downplayed the significance of China's nuclear 
program, which they say is still in the early stages. In its history, China has 
conducted 40 nuclear tests, compared to more than 1,000 by the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Its arsenal, estimated at 250 to 300 nuclear warheads, is smallest of the five 
main nuclear powers. 
</P>
<P>
 The United States staged its last test in 1992, France and Britain conducted 
their last in 1991 and Russia in 1990. Since 1992, China has been the only 
nuclear power to continue testing. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton Administration officials expressed U.S. displeasure at the Chinese 
action. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States deeply regrets this action," White House Press Secretary 
Dee Dee Myers said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
 "We urge China to refrain from further nuclear tests and to join the other 
nuclear powers in a global moratorium as we work to complete a comprehensive 
test ban treaty," White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers said in a 
statement.

 Japanese Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko paid homage to civil rights 
leader Martin Luther King Jr. on Friday on the first leg of their goodwill tour 
of the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese royal couple laid a wreath on King's grave at the Martin Luther 
King Jr. Center for Nonviolent Social Change and spoke with his widow, Coretta 
Scott King. 
</P>
<P>
 Mrs. King and Akihito talked as they walked around the wading pool surrounding 
King's tomb, while Michiko and King's eldest son, Martin Luther King III, 
strolled a couple of steps behind. 
</P>
<P>
 The couple bowed respectfully at the tomb, but one of King's contemporaries 
said the visit was hypocritical if Akihito does not address Japanese racism 
toward blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found Japan to be the most racist nation in the world," said civil rights 
activist Hosea Williams, who visited Japan in 1983. "I hope this visit is the 
beginning of a new relationship between African Americans and the Japanese." 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese politicians have made headlines for insulting remarks about blacks 
and other minorities, prompting protests and boycott threats from U.S. black 
leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Japanese firms operating in the United States have been accused 
of deliberately discriminating against blacks and Latinos in their hiring 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 The royal couple is on a 16-day tour designed to ease Japan's harsh image as 
the United States' toughest economic competitor. They plan to visit 11 U.S. 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 The trip is "to promote friendship and goodwill between our two peoples," said 
Takakazu Kuriyama, Japan's ambassador to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 It is the first time a Japanese emperor has visited the United States since 
Akihito's father, Hirohito, did so in 1975. Akihito last visited the United 
States as crown prince in 1987. 
</P>
<P>
 The emperor and empress made no public comments during their first stops in 
Atlanta, exchanging only pleasantries with dignitaries. 
</P>
<P>
 Before visiting the grave of the slain civil rights leader, the couple had 
lunch with former President Jimmy Carter at the Occidental Grand Hotel. 
</P>
<P>
 After a dinner at the Governor's Mansion on Friday night and a trip to the 
Atlanta History Center this morning, the royal couple was scheduled to leave 
Atlanta for Charleston, S.C.

U.S. TO SEEK PHASED N. KOREA CURBS; DIPLOMACY: U.N. WILL BE ASKED NEXT WEEK TO 
APPROVE SANCTIONS ENDING IN A FULL EMBARGO IF PYONGYANG REFUSES TO ALLOW 
NUCLEAR INSPECTIONS.

 The Clinton Administration said Friday that it will formally ask the U.N. 
Security Council next week to impose "phased" economic sanctions on North 
Korea, ending in a full embargo -- and possibly a naval blockade -- if 
Pyongyang does not respond. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said the draft resolution, expected on Tuesday, reflects an 
increasing receptivity by key members of the council -- including Russia and, 
to some degree, China -- after Pyongyang's continuing refusal to allow 
international inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats said the 15-member body could vote on a sanctions resolution by the 
end of the month -- relatively quickly by U.N. standards. Presumably, any 
embargo would take effect within a matter of days thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 The firm move by the United States, which follows a week of preliminary 
discussions with South Korea, Japan and members of the Security Council, marks 
the first step toward formal disposition of the North Korean dispute -- or 
possible military conflict, if Pyongyang chooses. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton met for an hour with his top national security advisers 
Friday to discuss the North Korean situation. The policy-makers met separately 
for three hours to hammer out details of the Administration strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. intention was announced in Istanbul, Turkey, by Secretary of State 
Warren Christopher, who immediately flew home from a North Atlantic Treaty 
Organization meeting to help plan the U.S. moves. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time to move forward with the resolution," he told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Although details of the U.S. proposal were still not firm, officials said it 
is expected to provide for a "phased" approach, calling for imposition of only 
modest economic restrictions at first, to be followed by a full embargo. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one official indicated that the sanctions might be enforced by a 
multinational naval blockade that would include U.S. warships. 
</P>
<P>
 There also could be extensive surveillance of shipping traffic in the area by 
U.S. radar aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials said Russia now seems likely to support the general plan. They 
expressed hope that China will abstain -- or at least refrain from vetoing the 
resolution -- despite its current public stance arguing that the United Nations 
should try more diplomatic negotiations first. 
</P>
<P>
 The officials also said Japan and South Korea both are fully behind the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. assessment appeared to be supported by a series of developments: 
</P>
<P>
 * In a move clearly designed to cement Moscow's backing for the sanctions 
resolution, Christopher said Friday that the Administration will support a 
Russian proposal to call an international conference to discuss the North 
Korean situation. 
</P>
<P>
 But officials here cautioned that, while the U.S. proposal will voice 
Washington's support for the idea of a conference, it will continue to press 
for passage of the sanctions resolution before such a meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 * In Vienna, the International Atomic Energy Agency, which oversees the 
nuclear inspection process, voted to withhold technical aid from North Korea 
because of its recalcitrance -- and China abstained from the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 Diplomats read the development as a signal that Beijing may be softening its 
opposition to sanctions, at least enough to agree not to veto the U.S.-backed 
sanctions resolution when it comes before the Security Council. 
</P>
<P>
 * In response to the vote in Vienna, Pyongyang quickly renounced its 
obligations to cooperate with inspectors and expelled two international 
observers. This action, analysts suggested, could heighten support in the 
United Nations for a sanctions resolution. 
</P>
<P>
 Immediately after the White House meeting, top U.S. officials intensified 
diplomatic efforts to win support for the sanctions resolution, telephoning 
their counterparts in other countries. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Peter Tarnoff, undersecretary of state for political affairs, 
arrived in South Korea to confer with leaders there. There still was no word 
whether he will also travel to Beijing. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration's new push on sanctions was accompanied by signs that it is 
beginning to bolster U.S. military readiness in the face of Pyongyang's threats 
that an embargo might bring on a new war. 
</P>
<P>
 Although officials said the Pentagon has not ordered more ships or troops into 
the region, Defense Secretary William J. Perry has ordered the aircraft carrier 
Independence to remain within three sailing days of Korea, rather than steaming 
to Hawaii for an exercise. 
</P>
<P>
 Also Friday, former President Jimmy Carter conferred with White House National 
Security Adviser Anthony Lake. Carter plans a trip next week to confer with 
leaders of North and South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 He was invited initially by North Korea -- possibly because the Communist 
regime there is looking for a face-saving way to defuse the standoff, U.S. 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 South Korean leaders have reacted coolly to Carter's impending visit, partly 
because they fear that it may detract from the effort to push through a 
sanctions resolution. As President in the late 1970s, Carter proposed pulling 
U.S. troops out of South Korea. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute between the allies and North Korea involves Pyongyang's refusal to 
permit international inspection teams to monitor and take samplings from its 
nuclear reactor at Yongbyon so the country's claim that it has no nuclear 
weapons can be verified. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Pyongyang denies that it has any nuclear warheads, the CIA estimates 
that North Korea already has manufactured enough weapons-grade plutonium to 
make one or two nuclear bombs and says it could build another four or five by 
the end of this year. 
</P>
<P>
 The wrangling came to a head two weeks ago, when the IAEA reported that North 
Korea had removed enough of the fuel rods from its shut-down reactor to dash 
hopes of determining whether the country has any nuclear weapons -- in 
violation of its obligation under an international treaty. 
</P>
<P>
 The agency's action Friday -- in which it denied North Korea about $250,000 in 
technical aid pledged to help it meet its international obligations -- was 
mainly symbolic, important primarily because of the fact that China, North 
Korea's longtime ally, abstained from the vote. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to suspend the aid came on a vote of 28 to 1, with only Libya 
backing Pyongyang. 
</P>
<P>
 Hans Blix, the international agency's director general, told reporters later 
that "it's clear we have reached something of a watershed in our relations with 
North Korea."

 Pine reported from Washington and Wright from Istanbul. Times staff writer

FOREIGN REPORTERS FACE RISING CONTROLS, CURBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KENNETH FREED, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Haitian government and its military masters, already well practiced at 
terrorizing their own citizens, are beginning to bare their teeth against 
foreigners, particularly journalists. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign reporters, who always have faced minor and harmless harassment -- at 
least contrasted with the brutal, often bloody treatment of the local press -- 
are now confronted with increasing controls and even possible banishment, 
diplomatic and Haitian sources say. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the harassment is official. Starting late in May, all reporters 
entering Haiti were required to obtain an official credential from the Ministry 
of Information. 
</P>
<P>
 But when a colonel in the military high command realized the press cards were 
free, he ordered payment, first of $25, then $50 -- in U.S. cash and renewable 
every four months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ministry officials said the next step is likely to be the closing of "national 
security areas" to the foreign press, including parts of the country where 
gasoline and other embargoed goods are smuggled into Haiti, meaning the border 
with the Dominican Republic and most ports. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the ministry officials said, the government is considering 
requiring journalists to obtain permission to leave Port-au-Prince on reporting 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 This would effectively leave the government and the military free to step up, 
without press witnesses, the already bloody repression in the countryside. 
</P>
<P>
 More ominous are the reports coming from the government that it may order all 
or most foreign reporters out of the country, on grounds that the journalists 
are in league with supporters of ousted President Jean-Bertrand Aristide or are 
serving as advance agents for a possible U.S. military intervention. 
</P>
<P>
 According to some sources, the issue is still under debate, with a few 
civilian officials and military officers arguing that it will isolate the 
country further. 
</P>
<P>
 Others say there is nothing to lose, that the presence of the journalists only 
inflames the already anti-Haitian sentiment of the international community. 
</P>
<P>
 However the debates turns out -- and it may become moot for many who soon will 
find it impossible to get here in the wake of Friday's halt by President 
Clinton of flights in and out of Haiti -- journalists are finding it more and 
more difficult to work. 
</P>
<P>
 Television cameramen, in particular, are being accosted. 
</P>
<P>
 One was arrested recently and detained for five hours. He lost film he shot of 
trucks unloading smuggled gasoline at a major border crossing from the 
Dominican Republic. 
</P>
<P>
 Other TV reporters complain regularly of army personnel blocking camera shots 
and forcing news crews to leave sensitive areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Print reporters generally have been allowed to work, largely because it is 
easier for them to stay out of sight. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the government harasses them in indirect ways. Recently, the military 
ordered two of three international phone lines cut from a hotel favored by 
foreign reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 Freed was recently on assignment in Haiti.

'AUSCHWITZ LIE' BILL DEFEATED IN GERMANY'S UPPER HOUSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Germany's upper house of Parliament threw out a government bill Friday for 
tougher anti-crime measures, including laws to counter neo-Nazi propaganda and 
to criminalize the so-called "Auschwitz Lie." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bundesrat had called for elements in the bill aimed at fighting the far 
right to be separated from measures aimed at ordinary crime. But the government 
called that suggestion "totally absurd." 
</P>
<P>
 The rejected bill would have made the "Auschwitz Lie" -- denying that the 
Holocaust happened -- a criminal offense and would have broadened the ban on 
the use of Nazi symbols in Germany.

DONOR NATIONS ANTE UP FOR PALESTINIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The United States and other nations eased a budget crisis threatening 
Palestinian autonomy on Friday by promising to come up immediately with $42 
million for the new administration in Gaza and Jericho. 
</P>
<P>
 The donor nations agreed to give the money after the Palestinians described 
their spending plans and government structure in an effort to dispel donor 
concerns of waste or corruption, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The money, expected today or soon after, will help to cover a projected 1994 
operating deficit of $77 million. Palestinian leaders are struggling to finance 
a rapidly growing police force and establish a civil service in the newly 
autonomous zone encompassing the Gaza Strip and Jericho on the West Bank. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash shortage is so acute that some Palestinian staffers do not even have 
telephones. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am very satisfied," Nabil Shaath, a Palestinian peace negotiator, told a 
news conference at the close of a two-day meeting of donor nations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the meeting has made significant progress toward making peace work on 
the ground," he said, referring to the agreement between Israel and the 
Palestine Liberation Organization granting the Palestinians limited self-rule. 
</P>
<P>
 After the accord was signed in September, donor nations pledged more than $2 
billion over five years to help move the autonomy process along. But almost 
none of that money has come in. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors are jittery about PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat's history of handing out 
cash without keeping records and are seeking assurances that the money will not 
end up lining the wrong pockets. 
</P>
<P>
 Arafat became so irked by the donors' failure to deliver that he threatened 
last week to delay his arrival in Jericho unless the process was speeded up. No 
day has been set for his arrival, but a PLO memo made public Thursday said the 
organization's offices in Tunis, Tunisia, will close by June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaath said the donor money would go for "start-up costs" that will make the 
Palestinians self-reliant. An increasing percentage of the budget is expected 
to come from tax collection. 
</P>
<P>
 Donors said they would meet again in Paris on July 10 and 11 and expect to 
come up then with the remaining $35-million shortfall in the Palestinians' 1994 
operating budget of $168 million. The entire deficit was not covered this time 
because some donor nations had not yet responded. 
</P>
<P>
 Countries that weighed in with money on Friday were the United States, with 
$10 million, Canada, Japan, Saudi Arabia and Norway, officials said.

BANGLADESH WRITER HIDES TO AVOID ARREST OVER HER QUOTED REMARKS ON KORAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Feminist writer Taslima Nasrin remained in hiding Friday, avoiding a dragnet 
for her arrest on charges that she insulted Islam, while thousands of people 
poured into the streets of Dhaka to demand her death. 
</P>
<P>
 About 10,000 people demonstrated in Bangladesh's capital, calling out, "Death 
for the infidel." 
</P>
<P>
 "We demand her death and nothing less," chanted one protester among thousands 
streaming from the city's dozens of mosques after Friday noon prayers. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasrin, a physician-turned-writer in her late 30s, came under fire when the 
Statesman newspaper in Calcutta reported that she had said Islam's holy book, 
the Koran, should be "revised thoroughly." She has denied saying this. 
</P>
<P>
 The government ordered her arrest after the Bangladesh Times reprinted the 
Statesman article last Saturday, triggering an angry reaction from local 
Islamic fundamentalist groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Nasrin has since been in hiding, eluding a nationwide police dragnet. Her 
friends have said that a mandatory "no-bail" provision attached to the arrest 
order probably persuaded her not to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said Friday that Nasrin was eluding arrest through friends and 
influential contacts. 
</P>
<P>
 Fundamentalist groups have vowed to press a national campaign for Nasrin's 
arrest and execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly a dozen religious leaders led a protest march from Dhaka's central 
Baitul Mokarram mosque, saying they would not tolerate any move to let Nasrin 
go free. 
</P>
<P>
 In a letter sent Thursday to the speaker of the Bangladesh Parliament, Nasrin 
said she was misquoted by the Statesman, and blamed an inexperienced non-Muslim 
reporter. 
</P>
<P>
 "The female reporter of Statesman failed to understand the difference between 
the Koran and Sharia law. I asked for changes in the Sharia law to ensure equal 
rights for men and women," Nasrin said in the letter.

 "Not a single word in the Koran can be changed. I know that fully well and I 
have never said anything about changes in the book," Nasrin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bangladesh has banned Nasrin's book "Lajja" ("Shame"), saying it offends 
Muslim sentiments and lies about the sufferings of Bangladesh's minority 
Hindus. 
</P>
<P>
 The Women's Development Forum of Bangladesh has demanded the withdrawal of 
charges against Nasrin. 
</P>
<P>
 The case is reminiscent of that of Salman Rushdie, author of "The Satanic 
Verses," which was regarded by many Muslim fundamentalists as blasphemous. 
</P>
<P>
 Rushdie has been in hiding since 1989, when Iran's late spiritual leader 
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini called for his death.

YELTSIN ACTS TO PROVIDE HOMES AND COUNTER SCAMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICHARD BOUDREAUX, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Boris N. Yeltsin, adding a touch of populism Friday to his 
free-market reforms, announced steps to provide millions of Russians with new 
homes and to protect them from ruin by financiers promising fabulous returns on 
their savings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an impermissible situation whereby the majority of the population 
cannot afford to buy an apartment," he told a Kremlin news conference. "Every 
individual has to be given a chance." 
</P>
<P>
 Under a flurry of presidential decrees, public housing projects stalled by 
lack of government funds will be auctioned off to private investors to spur 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The revenue will underwrite a broad program of credits, subsidies and vouchers 
to help Russians pay for the new homes. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 10 million Russians are on years-long waiting lists for public 
housing. Many are waiting in communal apartments, hostels, army barracks, 
school buildings and shantytowns unfit for human habitation. Many young people 
live with parents long after growing up and starting their own families. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin said that from now on, "any young person getting a job" will 
immediately receive a credit to buy or build a home -- up to 70% of the cost. 
"And then, as everywhere in the civilized world, he will have 30 years to 
repay." 
</P>
<P>
 Such credit possibilities are untested on a large scale in Russia, 2 1/2 years 
into Yeltsin's post-Communist reforms, so the program will be government 
supervised. 
</P>
<P>
 If it works, officials say, the construction boom could fuel a recovery of the 
slumping economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Relatively few in Russia have benefited so far from the reforms, under which 
the government has freed prices and sold off most state-owned enterprises. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin admitted Friday that nearly half of all Russians now live near or 
below the poverty line. 
</P>
<P>
 But looking back on the last year -- in which he disbanded the hostile Supreme 
Soviet, crushed its armed defenders with a tank assault, won voter approval of 
a new constitution and oversaw the election of a new, somewhat less hostile 
Parliament -- he claimed to have achieved political stability. 
</P>
<P>
 "A new political reality has been formed in this country," Yeltsin said. "The 
principle 'All power to the soviets' has become invalid. . . . We now have an 
opportunity to focus our efforts on creative activities, on alleviating 
economic and everyday problems of common people." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the housing shortage, Yeltsin complained about the proliferation of 
unregulated investment funds, quasi-banks and joint stock companies that 
promote get-rich-quick schemes on the airwaves, ad pages, billboards and 
telephone lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials say the number of scam victims is easily in the hundreds of 
thousands, and their losses run to the tens of millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin signed a decree imposing a truth-in-advertising ethic on such 
investment companies, under pain of losing their licenses. 
</P>
<P>
 From now on, the firms must disclose the size of dividends paid during the 
previous year and refrain from making claims about future profitability. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can promise the public only what you have in reality," Yeltsin warned. 
</P>
<P>
 Yeltsin's wide-ranging news conference was held on the eve of a three-day 
holiday marking Russia's 1990 declaration of independence from the Soviet 
Union. It also marks the end of his third year through a five-year presidential 
term. The 63-year-old leader looked fit and feisty. 
</P>
<P>
 He predicted that the country's long industrial recession will hit bottom next 
month. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he will travel to the Greek island of Corfu to sign a partnership with 
the European Union if an agreement is reached before the June 24-25 meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed deal, European nations would phase out quotas on many 
Russian exports and replace them with tariffs. 
</P>
<P>
 To meet one of Europe's conditions, Yeltsin signed a decree Friday allowing 
foreign banks gradual entry into the Russian market. 
</P>
<P>
 The measure lifts a restriction he imposed last November at the request of 
Russian bankers that said foreign banks operating in Russia could serve only 
foreigners.

RUSSIA TO SEND PEACEKEEPERS TO RESTIVE GEORGIA; MILITARY: MOSCOW HOPES TO AVERT 
FURTHER WARFARE IN ABKHAZIA PROVINCE. SOME WORRY ABOUT IMPARTIALITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In a move viewed with some apprehension in the West, Russia announced Friday 
that it will send 4,000 peacekeeping troops to neighboring Georgia to prevent a 
resurgence of ethnic warfare in Georgia's secessionist Abkhazia province. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian Defense Minister Pavel S. Grachev made the announcement in Georgia 
after gaining approval from the leaders of Georgia and Abkhazia, who had signed 
a partial peace accord May 14. 
</P>
<P>
 The Russian troops will reinforce a fragile cease-fire and oversee the return 
of thousands of refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 The peacekeeping mission, expected to get a go-ahead from the Russian 
Parliament next week, will be the first set up by Moscow under the gaze of U.N. 
observers. As such, it will be a closely watched trial of whether Russian 
troops can promote stability along Russia's perimeter without imperial bullying 
or taking sides in other people's feuds. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Georgia, a fundamental test of peacekeeping in the former Soviet Union is 
imminent," Madeleine Albright, U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, said in a 
speech Wednesday, noting that Russian army units have in the past "exacerbated 
local conflicts," including the one in Abkhazia. 
</P>
<P>
 President Clinton rejected an appeal by Georgian leader Eduard A. Shevardnadze 
in March to put a U.S. peace force in Abkhazia to limit Russian influence. 
</P>
<P>
 And last month, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali ruled out U.N. 
peacekeepers there because Georgia and Abkhazia had failed to settle their 
thorniest difference -- Abkhazia's demand for independence. 
</P>
<P>
 Burdened by almost 300,000 war refugees, Shevardnadze reluctantly accepted the 
Russian peacekeeping offer. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgian officials said they hope that the refugees, mostly ethnic Georgians 
forced to flee last year from Abkhazia, which had a prewar population of half a 
million, will feel safe enough to go home and ease an enormous strain on 
Georgia's war-torn economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Having driven out the Georgian army but fearing its return, Abkhazian leader 
Vladislav Ardzinba accepted the Russian troops more eagerly. They will be 
deployed along the Ingur River, which separates the ethnically distinct 
province from the rest of Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The sooner the Russians arrive and stand at the border, the sooner we can 
rebuild our economy without having to look back over our shoulder," said Zurab 
Argun, an Abkhazian television commentator. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 3,000 people died in 13 months of fighting in Abkhazia, which 
started with a Georgian attempt to crush the province's limited autonomy and 
ended last September in an Abkhazian victory with covert Russian military 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 Grachev said 2,500 Russian troops already based in Georgia and Armenia will 
make up the first peacekeeping contingent and will take up positions as early 
as a week from now. They will soon be reinforced, he said, by 1,500 infantry 
troops from Russia and, eventually, by troops from other former Soviet 
republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the breakup of the Soviet Union and its army in 1991, Russia has openly 
sided with a breakaway Russian-speaking province that was fighting the central 
government of Moldova and with the pro-Communist government of Tajikistan, 
which is still fighting a guerrilla movement. 
</P>
<P>
 In both bloody clashes, Russia called its forces "peacekeepers" and said they 
were acting in the interest of regional stability. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the imperial taint of such missions, the United Nations and the 
West have refused Russia's request that its troops be given the "blue helmet" 
status of U.N. peacekeepers -- and be paid out of U.N. funds. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Western leaders recognize that few nations, except Russia, 
are willing to put troops on the line in the conflicts of the former Soviet 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
 "The fact is that the Russians are going to do things in these areas," said a 
senior Western diplomat who has come to accept that Moscow will exercise a 
relatively free hand in the region. "The point is to work with the Russian 
grain, not against it." 
</P>
<P>
 The diplomat and other Western officials said talks were under way in the U.N. 
Security Council on ways to give the Russian peacekeepers informal recognition 
and perhaps even "voluntary" financial contributions -- while keeping a close 
eye on their behavior. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not explicitly approving (the Russian force), but working with it," 
said Fyodor Starcevic, who oversees 22 U.N. observers in Abkhazia. 
</P>
<P>
 Georgian officials said they were told that the U.N. observer force will be 
expanded to at least 80 soldiers and that they will guard weapons depots. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with such informal supervision, many in Georgia and the West worry that 
the Russian peacekeepers will serve as a tool for Moscow's renewed efforts to 
dominate the Caucasus Mountain region where Georgia is located. 
</P>
<P>
 Russia is already planning to build five permanent military bases in the 
region and hopes to gain a peacekeeper role in the 6-year-old war between 
Azerbaijan and ethnic Armenians in that nation's Nagorno-Karabakh district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very dangerous to sign this agreement," said a Georgian Foreign 
Ministry official, fearful that the Russian presence will mean a de facto 
partitioning of Georgia, with independence for Abkhazia. 
</P>
<P>
 "The good news is that this agreement will bring stability to this part of the 
Caucasus," said John Colarusso, a specialist on the region at Canada's McMaster 
University in Hamilton, Ontario. "The bad news is that it will strengthen 
Moscow's imperial hold on the whole area." 
</P>
<P>
 Times special correspondents Hugh Pope in Istanbul, Turkey, and Chris Bird in 
Tbilisi, Georgia, contributed to this report.

WILL JOIN NATO PROGRAM, RUSSIA SAYS; MILITARY: STATEMENTS BY YELTSIN AND 
KOZYREV COME ON HEELS OF ALLIANCE'S REBUFF OF BID FOR SPECIAL TIES. BUT THE TWO 
LEADERS SIGNAL DISAPPOINTMENT. 
</P>

<P>
 Despite its obvious disappointment at terms offered by its longtime 
adversaries, Moscow is ready to enter a military partnership with the United 
States and its European allies, Russian leaders said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 At separate news conferences, Russian President Boris N. Yeltsin and his 
foreign minister, Andrei V. Kozyrev, stressed that Russia will sign the 
military cooperation agreement with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The 
accord would open the door for Russia to work with the West in such areas as 
joint military exercises, defense planning and peacekeeping operations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Certainly we will sign it," Yeltsin told reporters in Moscow. 
</P>
<P>
 Kozyrev, speaking to reporters here after addressing a meeting of foreign 
ministers from NATO and many of the former East Bloc states, said he hoped to 
come to NATO headquarters in Brussels "in the near future" to launch the 
cooperative arrangement. 
</P>
<P>
 After extensive talks with Kozyrev on Friday, Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher also said he expected Russian acceptance. 
</P>
<P>
 The statements were significant because they came less than 24 hours after 
NATO foreign ministers here effectively rebuffed Russian demands for a far more 
extensive agreement, including a formal political dialogue that many feared 
could give Moscow a direct influence within the alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 A communique issued after a meeting of NATO's 16 foreign ministers Thursday 
noted that the alliance was "interested in a broad dialogue with Russia." 
</P>
<P>
 But NATO Deputy Secretary General Sergio Balanzino clarified that any 
consultations would be informal and on a case-by-case basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is natural that it is not to their liking . . . (but) we said no to them," 
summed up German Foreign Minister Klaus Kinkel. 
</P>
<P>
 But ambiguities in Yeltsin's remarks and a clearly unhappy Kozyrev left the 
impression that Moscow had probably not yet given up its attempts to win a 
formal commitment from NATO that would expand the relationship to include talks 
on a broad range of European security issues as the price of its commitment to 
cooperate militarily. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, 20 nations, the majority of them once part of the Soviet empire, have 
signed the military cooperation accord with NATO, an agreement known formally 
as the "Partnership for Peace." 
</P>
<P>
 But because of its size and power, Moscow has argued it needs a "special 
relationship" with the Atlantic Alliance that includes a formal political 
dimension. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides gaining a say in alliance affairs, Moscow would like to use such a 
dialogue to reshape the current system of European defense agreements in a way 
that would effectively devalue NATO's role. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, Moscow reportedly would like to upgrade the role of the 
amorphous, 52-nation Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, 
transferring to it cooperative efforts in peacekeeping activities now being 
developed under the Partnership for Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 At his news conference, Yeltsin indicated that Moscow will pursue its demands 
for a broader relationship by trying to get commitments written into a detailed 
list of cooperative projects that must be negotiated as part of the program. 
</P>
<P>
 He spoke of the need for a protocol with NATO to deal with military aspects of 
the cooperative accord. At one point, he seemed to make it a condition of 
Russian involvement. 
</P>
<P>
 "They will sign this protocol, and we will sign that Partnership for Peace 
document," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But then he added: "Certainly we'll sign it. After all, even if some 
bureaucrats reject that protocol, we will sign it anyway." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Kozyrev nor Yeltsin gave any indication of when Moscow might sign the 
accord, although Kozyrev indicated that he wanted all negotiations on the 
details of cooperation completed before Russia signed the statement of 
principle committing it to the Partnership for Peace. 
</P>
<P>
 "I only want to come to Brussels once," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other nations involved in the program have committed themselves first in 
principle and left details for subsequent negotiation. 
</P>
<P>
 Apparently irked at being rebuffed Thursday, the Russians held up agreement of 
a final statement on Friday's meeting -- which included other non-NATO 
countries -- for more than five hours with Cold War-style intransigence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been quite an experience for me as it has been for the other 
participants," admitted Balanzino, when asked about the Russian negotiating 
tactics. 
</P>
<P>
 Injecting a sense of history into Friday's meeting, Polish Foreign Minister 
Andrzej Olechowski urged Moscow to join with the West and not draw a new line 
through Europe, saying: "The decision of the former Soviet Union not to 
participate in the Marshall Plan . . . was one of the factors clinching the 
division of Europe. We hope this mistake will not be repeated and Russia will 
join the Partnership for Peace, the program for the rehabilitation of European 
security after the period of confrontation."

CARDENAS, MEXICO'S SAD-FACED REVOLUTIONARY, POLARIZES A NATION; POLITICS: 
VOTERS EITHER LOVE OR LOATHE THE LEFTIST CANDIDATE. EFFORTS TO BROADEN HIS 
APPEAL HAVE FAILED.

<P>
 It's hard to see Cuauhtemoc Cardenas as a dangerous radical. 
</P>
<P>
 Beneath a giant statue of his father, Gen. Lazaro Cardenas, Mexico's most 
beloved modern president, the tall, sad-faced man speaks in a solemn voice 
about the goals of the revolution, the same principles expounded in this 
country's election speeches for the last six decades. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet this wooden speaker provokes fiery declarations of devotion from the 
crowds that go to hear him and equal loathing from those who only read about it 
in the next day's newspapers. 
</P>
<P>
 Foreign and Mexican investors threaten to pull their money out of the country 
if he becomes president. 
</P>
<P>
 Last Saturday, he received a widely publicized threat that he would be killed 
this week. He brushed aside a scrawled note calling him a "social scar" that 
the writer, whose identity was unclear, was willing to eliminate. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Mexicans breathed a sigh of relief when the 60-year-old Cardenas emerged 
battered from this country's first presidential candidates' debate last month 
and further bruised a few days later from an encounter with rebels in the 
southern state of Chiapas. 
</P>
<P>
 Others panicked as they saw hopes that had been nurtured for seven years -- 
since Cardenas' last presidential campaign -- dissipating in a few weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas has slipped into third place among the contenders in most polls. For 
months, as the candidate of the Revolutionary Democratic Party, or PRD, which 
he helped found, Cardenas had run a solid second behind the ruling party 
candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 There were still enough undecided voters to help him pull off the victory many 
Mexicans believe was stolen from him by fraud at the polls six years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 With the debate and a visit a few days later to the camp of armed Indian 
peasants who rose up against the government in Chiapas on Jan. 1 demanding 
better living conditions and democracy, Cardenas had hoped to swing those 
undecided votes to him. Instead, he appeared unable to counter the criticisms 
of his opponents and was chided by rebel leader Subcommander Marcos as being 
undemocratic. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly destroyed by bold moves to broaden his appeal, Cardenas recently 
returned here to his home state of Michoacan to try to shore up his core 
support by playing his political trump card: the memory of his father. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have a good organization here," Cardenas said in an interview between 
campaign jaunts to the towns where he grew up, in the state he was governing 
when he broke with the ruling party in 1987. "We have been working here a long 
time." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, he was working hard to assure a good turnout that evening. 
</P>
<P>
 He spent the morning and early afternoon on a whistle-stop tour, inviting 
supporters to this town of pine trees and whitewashed buildings, birthplace of 
Lazaro, who expropriated the foreign oil companies and distributed land to 
peasants. 
</P>
<P>
 People piled into pickups and panel trucks to form a caravan winding through 
the countryside toward Jiquilpan. Squeezed into a white panel truck with yellow 
PRD banners hanging from the windows, Martina Cardenas, who is not related to 
the candidate, explained why she walked six miles from her village of Citala to 
catch a ride to see him. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father says we should be grateful to the government for the lands that 
they gave him," she said. "But I say that was a long time ago. What we need now 
is a road that they have promised for years and never built." 
</P>
<P>
 The head of their farming cooperative stands at the village precinct on 
election days and watches people vote to make sure everyone casts ballots for 
the Institutional Revolutionary Party that has ruled Mexico for 65 years, 
Martina Cardenas said. But in the presidential election Aug. 21, she added, she 
may defy him. 
</P>
<P>
 Such complaints provide fertile ground for candidate Cardenas' message of a 
revolution betrayed by technocrats. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to put the government in order and let the people govern," he 
promised at one stop. 
</P>
<P>
 But the ruling party technocrats, who have sold off hundreds of 
government-owned companies, declared there is no more farmland to distribute to 
peasant farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 And foreign investors are wary of Cardenas. The same last name that Mexican 
farmers find so appealing frightens them. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1934 in Mexico City while his father was campaigning for president, 
Cardenas was almost 4 years old when his father expropriated the foreign oil 
companies that had refused to obey a Mexican Supreme Court order in a labor 
dispute. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexicans formed long lines at the Palace of Fine Arts to contribute their 
jewelry and savings to pay for the nationalization of the oil companies. Little 
Cuauhtemoc turned in his piggy bank. 
</P>
<P>
 As a young civil engineer, he worked on one of Mexico's boldest projects for a 
government-owned company: the mammoth Las Truchas steel foundry, industrial 
port and hydroelectric plant that was built from nothing on the Pacific Coast 
of Michoacan. 
</P>
<P>
 The project cost the Mexican taxpayers hundreds of millions of dollars in 
construction costs, and, later, subsidies as international steel prices fell. 
It was among the companies sold in this administration. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas has tried to allay investor fears, making regular trips to the United 
States to talk with groups such as the World Affairs Council. 
</P>
<P>
 He hired a Washington consulting firm, the Whalen company, to help improve his 
image in the United States, but the strategy backfired this week when Whalen 
sent out a press release accusing the Cardenas campaign of being four months 
behind in its payments to the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas has also dropped his opposition to the North American Free Trade 
Agreement, the litmus test in the minds of many foreigners for acceptance of a 
global, free-market economy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do not think he scares sophisticated investors that much," economist 
Rogelio Ramirez de la O said. 
</P>
<P>
 But some large institutional investors who have stuck with Mexican stocks 
throughout the volatile last six months say they may take their profits or 
losses and leave if Cardenas is elected. 
</P>
<P>
 They are not convinced that Cardenas could withstand the pressures of the 
leftists around him to return to high tariffs and stiff regulations for foreign 
capital or even to expropriate some recently privatized industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas dismisses such ideas. 
</P>
<P>
 "The world is not the same as it was 60 years ago," he said. "Mexico is not 
the same." 
</P>
<P>
 A practical concern, one investor said, is that the government would be 
paralyzed as the new leaders try to sort out which jobs are political 
appointments and which are career posts in the bureaucracy, a problem that 
never arose when a single party always ran the country. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Mexican investors, even Cardenas aides repeat the joke about the warm 
reception he received at the Anahuac University, attended by children of the 
privileged. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why are you so enthusiastically supporting me?" the candidate is supposed to 
have asked one student. The reply: "Because my dad says that if you win we are 
moving to Vail." 
</P>
<P>
 But the biggest obstacle Cardenas may still have to overcome is the feeling of 
many Mexicans that he is a turncoat, part of the system when it served his 
interests and leader of a political rebellion when it became clear that he 
would not be nominated president. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas acknowledges that he became governor by dedazo , the big finger of 
the president choosing the candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "At that moment, I did not see any other way," he explained in an interview 
with his unlikely biographer, Paco Ignacio Taibo II, a well-known mystery 
writer. "I did not see any options for political or party work outside the 
state scheme. . . . The chance to govern Michoacan gave me the opportunity to 
open up (the political process) within the confines of a state government." 
</P>
<P>
 As a PRI governor, Cardenas recognized opposition victories in three large 
towns and half a dozen villages. 
</P>
<P>
 PRI attacks on him have been relentless. 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, Cardenas drew thousands of cheering students to a rally at the 
mammoth Mexican National Autonomous University -- where the ruling party 
candidate had been jeered. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, the PRI released a poll of 356 rural voters that indicated his 
support in the countryside may be far less than previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Only 11% said they favored Cardenas, while 45% said they would "never vote for 
him for president." 
</P>
<P>
 The independent polling firm that conducted the survey said its margin of 
error was 5.8%. 
</P>
<P>
 Cardenas replies with a rare laugh when asked why people react so strongly to 
him, either as loyal supporters or sworn enemies. 
</P>
<P>
 "This happens when a person has a clear line," he said. "The majority of the 
people have suffered. These people cannot be lukewarm. The country is in a bad 
way. The others have to defend their interests. They have a lot to lose." 
</P>
<P>
 What they have to lose, Cardenas tells supporters, is an economic policy that 
has benefited the rich at the expense of the poor. Just by eliminating 
corruption, the candidate says he can increase government spending by 10% 
without raising taxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There really has been nothing done to stop corruption," he said. "You have to 
cut off the head. Important people must be punished." 
</P>
<P>
 To fulfill those promises, Cardenas must pull his campaign out of third place. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his plan is to campaign intensely, visit more towns, do more 
interviews, advertise as much as his shoestring budget permits. 
</P>
<P>
 At every stop, he reminds supporters of the formidable challenge they face on 
Election Day, recalling how the computer vote-counting system mysteriously 
crashed in the 1988 presidential election, when half the returns showed him 
leading by a narrow margin. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many votes have to come in," Cardenas said, "that there can be no doubt 
about what the will of the Mexican people is."

VIOLENT CRASH KILLS 6 YOUTHS, GRANDMOTHER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven people, including six teen-age boys, were killed Friday in a collision 
that was so violent it split the youths' compact sedan in half. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol said the crash occurred at 12:45 p.m. on 
California 12 about half a mile from Suisun City.The site is about 60 miles 
northeast of San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Dead at the scene were the six youths and Pauline Buchanan Adams, 68, of San 
Jose, a passenger in the other vehicle. Her husband, Carmen Adams, 71, who was 
driving, and their granddaughter, 14-year-old Renee Adams, also were injured. 
The youths' identities were not immediately available. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP Officer Mark Mathias said witnesses reported that the teen-agers' 
eastbound Toyota Corolla had been speeding and passing cars when it swerved to 
avoid an oncoming delivery truck. 
</P>
<P>
 Their car moved into their own lane, then swerved again and careened back into 
the westbound lane, where it shifted sideways and collided with the San Jose 
family's vehicle, a Ford LTD Crown Victoria, which had been behind the delivery 
truck. 
</P>
<P>
 According to witnesses, the teen-agers' car was cut into two pieces, with the 
front of the vehicle and the rear section about 30 feet apart. The victims were 
in the rear section.

SEVEN CHARGED WITH SMUGGLING HAITIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seven people were charged Friday with smuggling 411 Haitian refugees to 
southern Florida in a case the prosecutor said was about "the exploitation of 
human misery." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Atty. Kendall Coffey said six Haitian refugees were believed to have died 
during the voyage in a 65-foot wooden ship, which arrived off Miami on April 
21. 
</P>
<P>
 "This case is about trafficking in human cargo and the exploitation of human 
misery," Coffey said. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike many other Haitian refugees, the 411 were allowed to be taken to an 
immigration processing center west of Miami. They were not shipped back to 
Haiti because the boat was too crowded, it lacked safety equipment and many of 
the refugees were sick, authorities said.

TWINS' PLIGHT REFLECTS U.S. HEALTH DEBATE; MEDICINE: DOCTOR WHO WAS AGAINST 
LAKEBERG BABIES' SEPARATION STANDS BY DECISION. HE SAYS CASE RAISES IMPORTANT 
ISSUES ABOUT REFORMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BARRY SIEGEL, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is his custom to work late most evenings, but by midday Thursday, Dr. 
Jonathan Muraskas, 38, a neonatologist at the Loyola University Medical Center 
near Chicago, found it necessary to flee his hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Lakeberg, the surviving conjoined twin baby separated in a 
controversial operation last August, had died early that morning at Children's 
Hospital of Philadelphia three weeks short of her first birthday. Now some 80 
reporters from all over the world wanted to know what Muraskas thought about 
Angela's death. 
</P>
<P>
 No wonder. As the Lakeberg twins' doctor for their first seven weeks of life, 
Muraskas had finally decided that the slim, 1% chance of a successful 
separation operation wasn't worth the expense and suffering. 
</P>
<P>
 After wrestling for weeks with a microcosm of the current national health 
debate -- when to set priorities, how to allocate resources -- he'd overcome 
his own instincts to always keep fighting. He'd begged the infants' parents, 
Ken and Reitha Lakeberg, to let their babies Amy and Angela go to heaven. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Lakebergs, inspired by the overwhelming news media attention, grown 
enchanted by the taste of celebrity and financial rewards, had chosen instead 
to transfer the babies to Children's Hospital in Philadelphia. There a team of 
doctors had been willing to perform the operation Muraskas had discouraged, 
separating the twins joined at the chest, knowing that Amy would die and Angela 
would be left with a badly deformed heart and immature lungs. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching from Loyola, Muraskas and other doctors had shaken their heads. 
Despite the ballyhoo over the operation, they didn't think Angela could 
survive. Her lungs were just too immature and damaged. They told each other 
privately that she would never get off her experimental respirator. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that prediction had proven true, and reporters wanted to hear Muraskas 
gloat. He sat still for a handful of interviews before he realized what the 
journalists were after. Then he bolted from the hospital and stopped answering 
his phone calls. 
</P>
<P>
 "To sit and say 'Aha, I was right,' that's not my style," he explained. 
"Listen, we lost a little girl to today. That's one of the hardest things. I 
have nothing but respect for the medical people in Philadelphia." 
</P>
<P>
 Angela had been doing well, Muraskas said. The staff in Philadelphia had been 
weaning her off her special negative pressure iron lung in which she lived. For 
up to six hours, she was breathing just with an oxygen mask. But her lungs were 
damaged from all the months of oxygen, and her chest wall was weak from the 
surgery. Then she developed a virus three weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday was the beginning of the end. She needed a mechanical respirator and 
100% oxygen. She had a fever, and probably pneumonia. Her heart was giving out. 
Three times they tried to get her back when she went into cardiac arrest. She 
died at 1:30 a.m., surrounded by medical personnel but no one from her family. 
</P>
<P>
 "When they decide to go, they just go," Muraskas said.  
</P>
<P>
 Angela's bill at Children's Hospital totaled well over $1 million. Since the 
Lakebergs are penniless and uninsured, much of the bill will be paid by 
Medicaid, the rest by "cost-shifting" the burden to other patients who are 
insured. 
</P>
<P>
 Angela's father, Ken, was transferred Thursday from a drug rehabilitation 
center to the Jasper County, Ind., jail where he faces auto theft charges. 
Reitha Lakeberg is living with her parents near Roselawn, Ind.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite Angela's demise, Muraskas sees some benefit from this experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "At least it raised issues," he said. "It taught people to look at the issues 
about health care." 
</P>
<P>
 His experience with the Lakebergs has also taught Muraskas something about his 
own practice. For awhile last summer, he'd hesitated to stop trying, he'd 
hesitated to tell the Lakebergs no, he'd hesitated to take the responsibility 
of drawing a line. Now he saw the consequences of leaving such decisions 
entirely to the parents or bureaucrats.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would still make the same decision, I would still make the same 
recommendation," Muraskas said. "I just might make it sooner, and more firmly."

 A woman who was terrified of hospitals delayed getting an ovarian tumor 
removed, and when her family finally got her to agree to surgery last month it 
had grown to 156 pounds. Evelyn Geffers, 63, of San Angelo, Tex., says she 
wants to learn to roller skate with her grandchildren now that doctors have cut 
her weight in half by removing the benign growth.

GANGS CAUSE CAMP FOR YOUTHS TO CLOSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The governor abruptly suspended operation of a boot camp-style school for 
troubled teen-agers Friday because of gangs, drugs and fighting. 
</P>
<P>
 Gov. Lowell P. Weicker Jr. acted after the state's chief prosecutor delivered 
a report sharply critical of the National Guard Youth Corps camp, the first 
established in the nation under a federal program. 
</P>
<P>
 Fights, sex, drug use and gambling disrupted the camp, Chief State's Atty. 
John Bailey said in his report. Gang members had tried to recruit other corps 
members before being expelled, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Brig. Gen. David D. Boland resigned as the program's director earlier this 
month amid news reports about troubles at the camp, which opened last summer in 
Niantic, Conn. 
</P>
<P>
 While there was sex between some of the girls and boys enrolled in the Youth 
Corps, Bailey said reports of prostitution were unfounded. He also said only 
one fight at the camp involved weapons, and that most of the drug use was 
confined to marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
 Connecticut received about $4 million in federal funds, which was to be used 
to educate 400 students in a year's time. The program had already graduated 180 
students. Its last class of students will graduate July 2 as planned.

WOMAN'S ARM, BREAST AMPUTATED IN RACE TO STOP DEADLY BACTERIA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A woman stricken with a deadly strain of bacteria was fighting for her life 
Friday after three operations in which she lost her left arm and a breast, her 
physician said. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's desperately ill," said Dr. Charles Brantigan, chief of surgery at 
Presbyterian-St.Luke's Medical Center. 
</P>
<P>
 The 51-year-old woman's identity has been withheld at the request of family 
members "who are under a great deal of stress," Brantigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 Surgeons on Thursday amputated her left arm and breast in a race to stop the 
spread of streptococcus Group A, a virulent form of streptococcal bacteria. She 
had another operation during the night in which tissue was taken from both of 
her legs. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman is being treated with enormous amounts of antibiotics, and doctors 
finally were able to move her into a hyperbaric chamber Friday, Brantigan said. 
</P>
<P>
 The chamber forces heavy concentrations of oxygen into the blood in order to 
speed up the healing process. 
</P>
<P>
 Brantigan said the woman came to the emergency room Wednesday, complaining of 
pain in her ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 She did not mention at the time that she was suffering from a sore throat, but 
a culture later showed that she had strep throat. 
</P>
<P>
 Brantigan stressed that the disease is not new, and that the best course of 
action is quick treatment when such symptoms as high fever, delirium and a 
spreading rash occur. 
</P>
<P>
 "Patients with this disease know they are real sick. They have high fever and 
they feel terrible. They need to seek medical advice," he said at a news 
conference. 
</P>
<P>
 Brantigan said the medical team treating the woman was receiving penicillin as 
a precaution, and that throat cultures have been taken from family members.

ROSTENKOWSKI PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO CORRUPTION CHARGES; COURT: HOUSE LAWMAKER 
VOWS TO 'WASH AWAY THE MUD' FROM HIS REPUTATION. HIS ATTORNEY SAYS HE WILL 
LAUNCH A CONSTITUTIONAL ATTACK ON ALLEGATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RONALD J. OSTROW and ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Dan Rostenkowski pleaded not guilty Friday to 17 felony corruption 
charges and left U.S. District Court here vowing to "wash away the mud that has 
been splattered on my reputation." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside the federal courthouse -- where cases from the Watergate scandal of the 
Richard Nixon era to the Iran-Contra scandal of the Ronald Reagan 
Administration have been tried -- the Illinois Democrat said little, leaving it 
to his newly retained attorney, Dan K. Webb to declare: "On behalf of the 
defendant, we enter a plea of not guilty to each and every count of the 
indictment." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb, the former U.S. attorney in Chicago, made clear that he will launch a 
constitutional attack on what he branded a "kitchen sink" of charges. He 
contended that the executive branch was infringing on congressional duties by 
trying to decide which of Rostenkowski's expenditures were for official 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 In an indictment returned by a federal grand jury on May 31, Rostenkowski is 
accused of charges ranging from accepting kickbacks of government funds from a 
son-in-law to buying cars for his family with public and campaign money. He 
also is accused of using government wages to pay 14 employees who did little or 
no official work and performed such personal chores as mowing the lawn at his 
summer home and photographing the wedding of one of his daughters. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the grand jury charged that the congressman used postage vouchers 
to steal cash from Congress, purchased gifts for friends and supporters with 
government funds and, in what appeared to be the most insidious of the 
accusations, tampered with a federal witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Reading from a written statement to reporters in the glare of a late afternoon 
sun, Rostenkowski said: "Some ask: 'How could I have done these things?' The 
answer is simple. I didn't do them. Talk is cheap and allegations come easily. 
In court, they will be subjected to a higher standard. . . . They will fail the 
test and I will be vindicated." 
</P>
<P>
 During a 14-minute court session, U.S. District Judge Norma H. Johnson said 
that Rostenkowski could remain free on his personal recognizance on one 
condition imposed by the government: that he not discuss the case with anyone 
who might become a witness. Asked whether he agreed to the condition, 
Rostenkowski replied in an uncharacteristically soft voice: "I do." 
</P>
<P>
 That condition presumably resulted from the count of the indictment that 
accuses Rostenkowski of instructing an employee not to reveal certain 
information to the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge set no date for the trial, which Webb estimated would last six 
weeks. Rostenkowski was neither fingerprinted nor photographed before or after 
the arraignment. But Herbert Rutherford, U.S. marshal for the District of 
Columbia, said that delaying those procedures was "not that unusual." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb brushed aside questions about whether constitutional challenges would 
delay the trial, saying: "If I file a constitutional motion and I win, it 
doesn't necessarily delay anything. I win. The case is dismissed. The 
congressman is exonerated of all wrongdoing." 
</P>
<P>
 Webb contended that virtually all the charges are based on the allegation that 
Rostenkowski "spent congressional money for purposes that were not official in 
nature." 
</P>
<P>
 "Who determines whether or not certain expenditures are official? The 
Constitution says it has to be determined by Congress," Webb said. "In fact, 
this indictment is an effort by the executive (branch) to define official 
duties. By so doing, they have violated a number of provisions of the U.S. 
Constitution." 
</P>
<P>
 If Webb decides to mount constitutional challenges to the indictment, the 
trial could be delayed until next year -- well beyond congressional 
consideration of President Clinton's health care plan. As chairman of the Ways 
and Means Committee, Rostenkowski would have played a major role in that 
process. But because of the indictment he was forced to step down from the 
chairmanship. 
</P>
<P>
 While saying that he agrees with U.S. Atty. Eric H. Holder Jr. that the case 
should go to trial "as rapidly as possible," Webb added that he had "absolutely 
no intention of relinquishing any of the congressman's constitutional rights." 
</P>
<P>
 When a reporter urged Rostenkowski to answer the indictment's allegation that 
he used congressional funds to pay a godson to mow his vacation house lawn, 
Webb instead stepped in saying: "Let me address that," and switched the 
question to "so-called ghost payrollers." 
</P>
<P>
 Evidence at trial, he contended, will show there were no ghosts. Instead, they 
were "people who worked and performed services," Webb said. "Who's going to 
define the word official?" 
</P>
<P>
 The lawyer contended that congressional staff members are specifically 
authorized by law to perform personal services on their off-hours if they 
choose to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 The statute of limitations has run out on nine of the 14 ghost workers cited 
by the indictment, Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rostenkowski filed a financial disclosure statement Friday on Capitol Hill 
showing that he has collected more than $750,000 for his legal defense fund 
from lobbyists and friends. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal war chest, established last August at a time when he was under 
federal investigation but still in control of the Ways and Means Committee, 
included $5,000 donations from the Tobacco Institute, the Metropolitan Life 
Insurance Co., the Anheuser-Busch political action committee and Federal 
Express, the report showed. 
</P>
<P>
 New York real estate magnate Donald Trump gave $5,000, as did Jerry Reinsdorf, 
owner of the Chicago Bulls basketball team and the White Sox baseball club. 
Jack Valenti, Washington representative for the motion picture industry, gave 
$3,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The report showed other contributions from AT&T, General Electric, 
universities, steel companies and the banking and securities industries.

GROUPS FOOT TRAVEL BILLS FOR FOR U.S. HOUSE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 From Israel to Istanbul, House members roamed the globe last year at the 
expense of interest groups, according to financial statements that offer 
glimpses into the lives of America's lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
 Domestic destinations were favored as well, as scores of House members 
reported all-expense paid trips to such locations as Sun Valley, Ida., and Palm 
Springs. 
</P>
<P>
 In a connection that sparks outrage from groups pressing for government 
reform, the journeys often dovetailed with the lawmakers' legislative 
assignments. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Pat Roberts of Kansas, senior Republican on the House Agriculture 
Committee, reported eight all-expense paid trips in 1993. They included January 
travel to Marco Island, Fla., paid for by the National Pork Producers Council, 
and to Phoenix, courtesy of the National Cattlemen's Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. J. Roy Rowland (D-Ga.), a physician and member of a health subcommittee, 
traveled at the expense of the Tobacco Institute (to Palm Springs), the 
American Medical Assn. (to Atlanta), and the lobbying firm of Campbell Raupe 
Inc. (to West Palm Beach, Fla.). 
</P>
<P>
 House members are required to file financial disclosure statements annually 
that show income -- including a salary of $133,600 in 1993 -- assets, 
liabilities, gifts and other material, listed by ranges rather than specific 
dollar amount. 
</P>
<P>
 They show that the House has many millionaires, and that numerous lawmakers 
hold valuable stock portfolios. Others maintain business interests as diverse 
as the nation's economy. Among them is Rep. Elizabeth Furse (D-Ore.), who has 
holdings worth between $100,000 and $250,000 in a vineyard in her home state. 
</P>
<P>
 Other details in the thousands of pages of forms and figures: 
</P>
<P>
 * Speaker Thomas S. Foley (D-Wash.) took two expense-paid trips last year. One 
was provided by the Associated Press, when he spoke at the organization's 
annual meeting in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
 * House Minority Leader Robert H. Michel (R-Ill.) was one of several lawmakers 
making trips to charity golf tournaments, including Bryant Gumbel's in Orlando, 
Fla., last March, and the Danny Thompson Memorial in Sun Valley, Ida., in 
August.

</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stephen McNally, a New York lawyer who became a Hollywood actor best known for 
a series of detestable characters in such landmark films as "Johnny Belinda," 
has died. 
</P>
<P>
 McNally, who also appeared regularly on episodic television for many years, 
was 82 when he died June 4 at his Beverly Hills home, his family said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 A family spokesman said he died of heart failure. 
</P>
<P>
 Born Horace Vincent McNally in New York City, McNally got a law degree from 
Fordham Law School and practiced law for several years before pursuing a 
childhood dream of acting. 
</P>
<P>
 After starring in New York plays, McNally traveled to Los Angeles in 1942 and 
went on to appear in many classic films, usually as the villain but sometimes 
as a leading man. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to 1948's "Johnny Belinda," McNally's credits include "Thirty 
Seconds Over Tokyo," "Criss Cross," "Winchester '73" and "No Way Out." 
</P>
<P>
 In several of his earlier pictures he appeared as Horace McNally; he adopted 
the name Stephen for "Johnny Belinda" in 1949. 
</P>
<P>
 The respected anthology "The Film Encyclopedia" said that McNally "much too 
often was wasted on minor pictures." 
</P>
<P>
 On television, McNally was a guest star in everything from "Alfred Hitchcock 
Presents" to "Charlie's Angels." He also made numerous television commercials 
and in 1978 co-starred in the short-lived TV series "W.E.B." 
</P>
<P>
 McNally is survived by his wife, Rita, eight children and eight grandchildren. 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Mary Gates, 64, a director of major banking and communications corporations 
whose contacts greatly helped her son Bill's Microsoft Corp. Mrs. Gates was a 
director of several companies, including First Interstate Bancorp, US West Inc. 
and KIRO-TV, a Seattle television station. She had been a regent at the 
University of Washington since 1975.That year, she became the first woman 
director of First Interstate Bank and the first woman to serve as president of 
King County's United Way. She was later named to the national United Way 
committee and, in 1983, became the first woman to lead it. Her tenure on the 
national United Way committee is believed to have helped Microsoft at a crucial 
time in its development. In 1980, she discussed with then-IBM Corp. Chairman 
John Opel, who was also on the United Way committee, the business IBM was doing 
with Microsoft. Opel, some accounts say, knew little about the venture, but 
mentioned Mary Gates to IBM executives who introduced Microsoft at a meeting of 
IBM's top-level management committee a few weeks later. IBM contracted with 
Microsoft, then a small firm specializing in computer languages, to create an 
operating system for its first personal computer. Their success gave Microsoft 
a lift that eventually made it the world's largest personal computer software 
company. Sales now exceed $3 billion and her son is one of the nation's 
wealthiest men. In Seattle on Friday of cancer.

LINDA LUSCHEI HUNIO; ADVOCATE FOR WOMEN WITH HIV, AIDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Linda Luschei Hunio, a founder of Women at Risk, a Los Angeles advocacy and 
support group for women with HIV and AIDS, died Saturday of complications from 
the virus. She was 36. 
</P>
<P>
 Under her maiden name -- Linda Luschei -- she had been a frequent speaker in 
the cause of educating women about the risks of HIV infection while helping 
them confront ostracism. With a few female friends, Mrs. Hunio founded Women at 
Risk, based in Culver City. As an advocate, she lectured before students, 
church groups and health professionals, and was featured on TV and radio talk 
shows. In 1993, the city of Los Angeles honored her with a Lifetime Achievement 
Award for her efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Often, she told her own story. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of UCLA, Mrs. Hunio was working in the publishing industry in New 
York when she married Michael Ruggere in 1985. After his unexpected death a few 
months later, she learned she had HIV, having contracted the virus from her 
husband. He had evidently and unknowingly contracted HIV from transfusions 
before blood was tested for the virus. 
</P>
<P>
 For five years, she once told The Times, she kept her condition secret from 
all but a few confidantes, terrified of society's ignorance and bigotry. 
Overcoming those fears, she learned to caution women of their risk and urged 
those with HIV to seek joy in their lives. Her quest for love and companionship 
prompted her to place an ad in the L.A. Weekly personals identifying herself as 
HIV-positive. She dated several men as a result, both HIV-positive and 
negative. 
</P>
<P>
 In her last two years, her quest was answered by Stephen Jay Hunio of Los 
Angeles, who is also HIV-positive. They were married in March, a few days 
before Mrs. Hunio's illness required her to enter the hospital.

PADDLED BY PROFESSOR, STUDENT SUES; COLLEGE: CAL STATE FULLERTON TEACHER SAYS 
THE INCIDENT HAS BEEN DISTORTED. SCHOOL OFFICIALS SAY THEY HAVE TAKEN 
'APPROPRIATE ACTION.' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A professor emeritus who said he swatted an African American student on the 
bare buttocks with a ruler will not be teaching again at Cal State Fullerton 
anytime soon, according to a university official who said Friday that 
"appropriate action" has been taken in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Julian Foster has said he swatted the student during discussions over whether 
the student would be allowed to drop his political science class, but said his 
actions were part of a joke that has since been taken out of context. 
</P>
<P>
 The student, Keary Johns, 23, of Fullerton, filed a discrimination claim 
Friday against the professor and the university, seeking $1 million in damages. 
Johns said that the teacher's actions were degrading, but that he initially 
agreed to be paddled because he was desperate to drop the course and keep a 
failing grade off his record so he could graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Keating, spokesman for the university, said school officials looked into 
the incident earlier in the week and have since taken "appropriate action."  
</P>
<P>
 Keating declined to elaborate, but said that Foster, 67, will not be teaching 
classes during the upcoming summer, fall or spring sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred April 27 when Johns had asked to drop Foster's class. 
Johns said the professor offered him two choices: six whacks with a ruler or a 
failing grade. The student said he agreed to lower his sweat pants because he 
was desperate to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns said he backed away and began crying after Foster hit him once. He said 
Foster later told him that he had heard black fraternity members go through 
much worse during hazing. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the university community said Friday they were surprised by the 
peculiar incident, because Foster, who is white, is a well-regarded campus 
figure who has taught at the school since 1963. Leaders in the Orange County 
African American community said they are looking at the incident, but took care 
not to immediately categorize it as racist. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Thursday, Foster told The Times he regretted striking Johns. 
He said the incident took place after the professor and student tried to 
outbluff each other during a dispute over whether Johns should be allowed to 
drop the class to escape a failing grade. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint filed by Johns alleges racial discrimination and assault and 
battery. Foster has denied that race played any role. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johns said he was particularly offended by the comment Foster made 
regarding black fraternity members. "I don't honestly think he would have done 
this to a white kid," said Johns. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster said in a statement Friday that Johns originally asked the professor to 
give him a D grade, even though Johns never attended any classes. Foster said 
he was lecturing the student on whether he wanted to be treated like an a 
responsible adult or a "dumb kid who gets his bottom swatted." 
</P>
<P>
 Foster said he was joking, but Johns wanted to take him up on the offer. 
Trying to call the student's bluff, the professor said in his statement, Foster 
told Johns the penalty would be six lashes -- the same as an American teen-ager 
got in Singapore for a vandalism. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster said Johns surprised him by dropping his sweat pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I flicked him with the ruler and was about to admit that he had won the 
bluffing contest," when Johns' demeanor changed and he became upset, Foster 
said.

MOST MAJOR CRIMES POST DECLINE, LUNGREN SAYS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JERRY GILLAM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren said Friday that with the exception of homicide, the 
rate of major crimes reported in California decreased last year from 1992 
levels. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said the rate for violent crimes dropped 4.1%, and the property crime 
rate fell 3.3%. Overall, criminal offenses tracked in the Department of 
Justice's California Crime Index decreased 3.5%. 
</P>
<P>
 Although homicide was up 3.2%, rape was down by 9.1%, robbery declined 4.8%, 
and aggravated assault was down by 3.4%, the attorney general said. Burglary 
was down 4.5% and motor vehicle theft was down 1.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 California's crime rate almost tripled between 1952 and 1980, then began to 
decrease. Property crimes fell sharply, violent crime less so, until 1984. 
After that, most categories generally leveled off until last year's modest 
decline. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the downward trend -- perhaps obscured by the high-profile nature of 
so much present-day criminal activity -- a Los Angeles Times exit poll on 
Election Day last Tuesday turned up crime as a leading concern of voters. It 
was mentioned as the No. 1 problem by more voters in the poll -- 37% -- than 
any other in a list of problems affecting the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren said of the recent crime index findings: "This report brings mostly 
good news, but this is no time to stop demanding tougher sentences for 
criminals." 
</P>
<P>
 Lungren, who is seeking reelection, warned against current attempts to weaken 
tough anti-crime measures. 
</P>
<P>
 He cited a move to restrict the state's "three strikes" law by sending 
criminals to prison for 25 years to life only if their third felony is a 
violent act. As it is, any third felony conviction mandates that sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Dist. Atty. Gil Garcetti and the father of murder victim Polly 
Klaas have called on Gov. Pete Wilson and the Legislature to place such a 
proposal, which is less costly, on the fall ballot. Wilson has said he will 
veto any such bill. 
</P>
<P>
 "Its easy to talk tough on crime," Lungren said. " . . . And this year, nearly 
everybody will do it. Watch the actions of your elected officials and see if it 
matches with their tough talk."

21 UNIVERSITY STUDENTS SUSPECTED OF FALSIFYING THEIR RECORDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Twenty-one students at Cal State San Bernardino are under investigation for 
allegedly falsifying their student records and could face expulsion from the 
university and have their academic work voided. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Henderson, coordinator of student conduct at the campus, said the matter 
"is unusual because of the number of students (involved) and because of the 
nature of the accusations," but he declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 The allegations were brought to light June 2 by a university audit, school 
officials said, and the students involved have been notified. All are 
foreign-born, but officials said they were barred by confidentiality laws from 
giving further identification or saying how many among the group may be 
eligible for the school's June 20 graduation. 
</P>
<P>
 Randy Harrell, assistant vice president of student services, said officials 
hope to finish the investigation by graduation week.

BID TO PROBE TOBACCO PETITIONS DENIED; COURTS: JUDGE RULES THAT CHECKING FOR 
DECEPTION, AS CHARGED BY ACTING SECRETARY OF STATE TONY MILLER, WOULD BE AN 
UNWARRANTED INTRUSION INTO THE INITIATIVE PROCESS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Superior Court judge refused Friday to allow acting Secretary of State Tony 
Miller to question signers of a tobacco company-sponsored smoking initiative to 
see if they were duped, as Miller contends. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge John R. Lewis concluded that Miller's request to check for deliberate 
deception by petition circulators is "an unwarranted intrusion into the 
initiative process." 
</P>
<P>
 If, as Miller charges, there is evidence of fraud, the complaints can be 
turned over to local prosecutors or the attorney general, said Lewis, who found 
no legal authority to grant Miller's request. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller alleged that a Philip Morris-financed committee, Californians for 
Statewide Smoking Restrictions, intentionally deceived petition signers by 
telling them the measure would strengthen smoking restrictions. Actually, 
Miller said, its chief purpose is to abolish existing local smoking bans. 
</P>
<P>
 Following the judge's ruling, Miller said he would not file an appeal because 
he must decide by June 30 whether the petition has received the 423,473 valid 
signatures needed for it to qualify for the November ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Millers said he will, however, call for "truth in sponsorship" legislation to 
ensure that citizens know who is behind any petition they are asked to sign. 
Currently, state law requires identification of the chief sponsors of 
initiatives to be identified on mass mailings and in official reports, but not 
on the petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Miller also said he would refer numerous complaints of deception he has 
received to local district attorneys in the various counties, but Miller said 
he did not expect prosecutions. "The D.A.s have other priorities," he said. 
"They're busy prosecuting violent crime." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the initiative have said Miller raised the issue to promote his 
candidacy for secretary of state. On Tuesday, Miller won the Democratic 
nomination for the post and will face Republican Assemblyman Bill Jones of 
Fresno in November. 
</P>
<P>
 The chief legal issue before the court was whether Miller should be given 
access to names randomly chosen from the 607,000 signatures gathered by the 
initiative committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1972, when signers of an initiative to legalize marijuana charged that 
they were harassed by police, state law has protected the confidentiality of 
names on petitions. County election officials have access to the names to check 
the validity of the signatures, but other officials must apply to the court to 
see them. 
</P>
<P>
 John Mueller, an attorney representing the initiative committee, told the 
judge that "the express purpose of this statute was to protect people's right 
to privacy." To grant access to the names in this case "would set an extremely 
dangerous precedent" he said, and would have a chilling effect on the rights of 
those wishing to circulate or sign initiative petitions. 
</P>
<P>
 But Pamela S. Giarrizzo, staff attorney for the secretary of state's office, 
argued: "We don't believe there would be a chilling effect on signers of 
petitions. We do think it will have a chilling effect on crooked circulators."

2 VICTIMS OF MIDAIR PLANE CRASH IDENTIFIED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two of the three people killed in the midair collision of two small planes 
near Banning Municipal Airport on Thursday were employees of a Burbank aerial 
photography business, the company said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Curtis, director of marketing and sales for I.K. Curtis Services, 
identified the occupants of one plane, a Cessna 207, as pilot David Grimm, who 
was married and had four young children, and Brad Newton.Both men were from 
Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot of the second aircraft, who also died in the crash, was identified 
only as a Japanese national who was flying out of Brackett Field in La Verne, 
said Riverside County Sheriff's Department spokesman Deputy Mark Lohman. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the two planes appeared to clip wings before plunging into 
fields on the Morongo Indian Reservation and causing a grass fire. No one on 
the ground was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman said a Piper Cherokee, piloted by the unidentified Japanese national, 
was approaching the airport and headed into the afternoon sun when it collided 
with the Cessna, carrying Grimm and Newton, which was banking. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis said the two-man crew was taking photographs in the area, but said 
other details of the crash would have to come from investigators, who returned 
to the area Friday to continue their inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash is being investigated by the FAA and the National Transportation 
Safety Board.  
</P>
<P>
 Curtis said the company has established the Grimm Family Assistance Fund to 
help the pilot's family. Donations are being accepted at the company, 2919 
Empire Ave., Burbank, Calif. 91504.

 As many as 75 parents and volunteers worked evenings and weekends for six 
weeks just to spruce up the place. They scraped and painted the interior of the 
200,000-gallon pool, hung new doors and cleaned and painted the restrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 Even before the actual labor began, there were candy bars to sell and 
donations to be coaxed from community members, not to mention persuading the 
Pleasant Valley Recreation and Park District that the money could be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 But today the tap goes on, and by June 20, the 25-meter Freedom Pool on the 
former Air Force Base at Camarillo Airport will be open to the public in 
afternoon and early evenings.  
</P>
<P>
 Parents of the Pleasant Valley Swim Team contributed about $11,000 in cash 
donations and about $5,000 more in supplies and labor to get Camarillo's only 
outdoor pool reopened. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Stallings, the district's recreation supervisor, said the district will 
contribute between $16,000 and $20,000 from its operating budget to open the 
pool. 
</P>
<P>
 "That'll take us through the end of the summer," Stallings said. "After that, 
we'll have to see if the swim team wants to keep it open. We've all put in so 
much effort to getting it to the point that we haven't really looked ahead." 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Marcus, who has a 14-year-old daughter and 10-year-old son on the swim 
team, said parents already have plans to raise funds to keep the pool open next 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got one lady who is a professional grant writer who has offered her 
services, and during the off-season we plan on approaching some of the other 
user groups," Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
 Eventually, he said, the parent-run swim team hopes to operate the pool 
permanently. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pool is important to the community overall because it is the only outdoor 
pool in the area, but we've also had about 300% growth in the size of our swim 
team in the last three years," Marcus said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team has gone from about 40 members in 1991 to 146 this year, with 
participants ranging in age from 6 to 18. Marcus said parents hope to expand 
the team so that it can eventually compete nationally. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, community members were dismayed when the park district announced 
they did not have the funds to open the pool. Camarillo has only one other 
pool, Pleasant Valley Pool, an indoor facility which Stallings said has been 
overcrowded as a result. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're pretty much booked from first thing in the morning until 10 at night," 
he said. With the Freedom Pool's opening, he said the district will be able to 
offer more classes at the indoor pool, thus generating revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 For information about the cost of swimming lessons and operating hours at both 
pools, call the park district at 482-1996.

THIS SENIOR MISSED NOT A DAY OF SCHOOL IN 13 YEARS; ATTENDANCE: GINA HERNANDEZ 
NEVER DITCHED. NEVER SLEPT IN. NEVER STAYED HOME WITH SNIFFLES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Gina Hernandez has never missed a day of school. 
</P>
<P>
 Since her first day of kindergarten 13 years ago at Port Hueneme's Parkview 
School, she has never slept in, never ditched class to go to the beach, never 
even stayed home sick. 
</P>
<P>
 With her graduation from Hueneme High School less than a week away, the 
17-year-old is the only senior this year in the Oxnard Union High School 
District, and possibly in Ventura County, who has had perfect attendance from 
kindergarten through 12th grade. 
</P>
<P>
 That's 2,340 days of school, not including summer school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody always said, 'Gina, you never ditch school,' " Gina said Friday, 
the last day of classes for Hueneme High seniors. "I didn't see any point in 
it. In Oxnard, where are you going to go?" 
</P>
<P>
 As a youngster, Gina said, she went to school every day simply because it was 
the thing to do, with no conscious effort to have perfect attendance. 
</P>
<P>
 The turning point came, she said, in sixth grade. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina's elementary school friends had teased her that her attendance record 
would be ruined once she got chickenpox. No one, after all, goes to school with 
such a contagious disease. 
</P>
<P>
 So when her younger sister Jessica came down with chickenpox while Gina was in 
sixth grade, Gina demanded that her sister go to live with their grandparents 
for a week. 
</P>
<P>
 "She kicked her out of the house," Gina's mother, Jessie Hernandez, recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina came down with chickenpox anyway. But she got it on spring break and by 
the time classes resumed she was recovered. 
</P>
<P>
 The timing, Gina said, "really freaked me out. Out of all of the days in the 
year, I got them on spring break. It was fate." 
</P>
<P>
 Next to chickenpox, the worst illness she remembers having was a minor case of 
the flu during her sophomore year. The aches and pains lasted two days, she 
said, and they weren't bad enough to keep her at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "Other students will come in with the runny nose, a bit of sniffling, the 
tissue always out," Hueneme High business teacher Langdon Townesaid. "She's 
always healthy." 
</P>
<P>
 Although other schools around Ventura County have reported children who are 
completing sixth or eighth grade without a single absence, no county school 
district has a record of any other graduating seniors who have had perfect 
attendance throughout their school careers. 
</P>
<P>
 In some districts, officials said they don't bother to track which students 
have attended school every single day. 
</P>
<P>
 Hueneme High School officials also typically pay more attention to students 
who have a habit of skipping school than to those who come every day. 
</P>
<P>
 But Gina's perfect record prompted school officials to adopt a policy this 
week to recognize students with perfect attendance every semester from now on. 
</P>
<P>
 "The emphasis is on punishment," counselor Marcie Duncan said. "Gina was kind 
of a motivation for us to realize we had no emphasis on reward." 
</P>
<P>
 Schools need to reward good attendance, she said, because coming to school 
regularly is a habit that prepares students to be good employees after 
graduation. And before graduation, the students with perfect attendance are 
usually among those with the best grades, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gina has earned a 3.8 grade-point average out of a possible 4.0 at Hueneme 
High, even with the heavy load of Advanced Placement and other college-prep 
courses she has taken. 
</P>
<P>
 She began taking courses at Oxnard College last spring in order to get a head 
start on completing her college requirements and plans to attend the college 
full-time in the fall. She said she has not decided whether to get a business 
degree or become a physician. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Gina's friends in elementary school teased her about her habit of 
coming to school every single day, some of her fellow seniors at Hueneme High 
said they view Gina's perfect attendance record with a sense of awe. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's impressive," said 17-year-old Juanita Hernandez, who is not related to 
Gina, "that she could come every day, get up every day." 
</P>
<P>
 When asked how many days she had been absent during her senior year, Juanita 
raised her hand and smiled: "Uh, oh," she said. "Let's not get into that."

PROPOSAL WOULD LOOSEN BUSINESS RESTRICTIONS; VENTURA: MEETING PARKING AND 
PERMIT REQUIREMENTS WILL BE EASIER IF COUNCIL APPROVES. MAYOR SAYS CHANGES 
COULD SAVE CITY MONEY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 Ventura businesses would not have to provide as much parking for customers and 
some businesses could open with less red tape under a proposal the City Council 
will consider this month. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to quell criticism that City Hall is unfriendly to commerce, city 
planners have overhauled 75 pages of parking and permitting restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, restaurants must provide one parking space for every 45 square feet 
of dining area. In addition, restaurants must provide a parking spot for every 
250 square feet of other floor space. Under the new law, restaurants would have 
to provide only one parking space for every 100 square feet of business space. 
</P>
<P>
 Parking restrictions for other businesses have been similarly eased under the 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, a whole range of businesses that now must apply for special 
permits before they can set up shop would be free to open their doors in a 
commercial district with only a business license. 
</P>
<P>
 Most retail businesses are free to do that already, but the city makes certain 
establishments, such as churches, day-care centers and veterinary offices, slog 
through a lengthy and expensive permitting process. Depending on the type and 
size of business, permits can cost more than $1,000 and the processing of those 
permits can take two to three months, said Karen Bates, a city planner. 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of this is to make the process more business-friendly, and more 
streamlined, and to shorten things for people," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Pastor Leonard DeWitt at Ventura Missionary Church said the changes could save 
his church significant amounts of money. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, the church is applying to build a classroom building and a youth 
center, and to expand a counseling center on its property on High Point Drive. 
Traffic mitigation fees alone -- required for the church to receive a 
conditional use permit -- will cost about $40,000, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The proposed permit changes would not affect the church's plans for the 
facility on High Point Drive because it is in a residential rather than 
commercial neighborhood. But Ventura Missionary officials are considering 
opening another site in a commercial area in downtown or midtown to serve the 
city's youth. There, the proposed changes would probably mean a large savings 
of time and money. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds almost too simple," he said. "I'd sure be interested in seeing the 
details. It sounds wonderful." 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Tom Buford said the proposed changes -- which the Planning Commission 
approved last month and the council will consider on June 20 -- will also save 
the city money. 
</P>
<P>
 "We recognized a couple of years ago that with the budget cutbacks, we needed 
to simplify restrictions at City Hall," he said, adding that streamlining means 
the city spends less to enforce myriad rules and regulations.

YOUTH JOBS PROGRAM STRUGGLING TO FILL POSTS; EMPLOYMENT: A WEEK BEFORE THE 
SUMMER BREAK, A FIFTH OF THE POSITIONS AVAILABLE TO AREA TEEN-AGERS REMAIN 
OPEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 With more than $3 million to spend on summer jobs for teen-agers, a Ventura 
County youth employment program is still struggling to fill its slots, 
especially in the more affluent east end of the county. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Clinton Administration initiatives have essentially doubled the money 
available this year, the nonprofit Job Training Policy Council is offering 
minimum-wage jobs to 1,200 to 1,500 disadvantaged teen-agers. But a week before 
school ends for the summer break, a fifth of the jobs remain open. 
</P>
<P>
 Only in rural Santa Paula, Fillmore and Piru have low income and disabled 
youths filled the jobs available. In fact, 134 students have signed up for the 
95 positions in those areas. 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard teen-agers have filled 600 of the 700 jobs set aside there, while 
students in Ventura, Moorpark and Ojai have filled two-thirds of their 
available slots. 
</P>
<P>
 But Simi Valley and Thousand Oaks teen-agers have been slow to apply, leaving 
more than half the jobs in those areas open. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have an entirely different mentality in the east end of the county, in 
that the program is being looked upon as another form of welfare," said Roberto 
de la Selva, operations manager for the program. "The need is definitely 
there." 
</P>
<P>
 Using census and school information, the program allocates jobs to each 
community based on the number of low income and special education students. 
Simi Valley has 86 positions, 45 of which have been filled. Thousand Oaks has 
74 spots and 28 applicants.  
</P>
<P>
 In cities such as Oxnard, with an established network for low income services, 
the youth jobs program receives referrals from counselors, teachers, even 
brothers and sisters who have been through the program, De la Selva said. 
</P>
<P>
 In the east county, though, "We're newer in terms of serving those areas. We 
don't have the links in the community," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In recent weeks, managers have promoted the jobs program in schools, on the 
radio and in newspapers to bring in applicants. They have had some success, but 
if they do not fill the slots the jobs could be shifted to handle the overflow 
applications in the Santa Paula area. 
</P>
<P>
 The program places teen-agers, aged 14 to 21, to jobs with government and 
nonprofit agencies around the county. Students are interviewed on their career 
interests and matched to appropriate jobs. Students who need remedial course 
work can attend and be paid for their time in class. 
</P>
<P>
 Those youths hired can receive an average of $1,000 for six to nine weeks' 
work. Officials at the jobs council estimate that every dollar generates three 
dollars for the economy  
</P>
<P>
 "For every dollar you put out to a kid, he spends the money at a mall, the 
mall hires more clerks," said Everett Vital, the intake manager for the youth 
jobs program. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton initiatives, designed to stimulate the economy, raised the program's 
annual grant from $1.5 million to about $2.5 million. Leftover funds delivered 
to the program late last summer brought this year's total to more than $3 
million. FYI

 Students interested in applying for summer jobs with the Job Training Policy 
Council can call 1-800-500-7705.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: MOTION TO DROP CASE REJECTED BY JUDGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A Ventura County judge rejected a motion to drop charges against a burglary 
suspect because two members of the district attorney's office allegedly 
eavesdropped on a conversation between the suspect and his attorney. 
</P>
<P>
 Superior Court Judge Charles W. Campbell Jr. denied the motion by Deputy 
Public Defender Mary Fielder during a hearing Friday, saying he did not believe 
the eavesdropping justified dropping the case against 30-year-old Robert Lee 
Morrow. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge also ruled in a separate hearing that the district attorney's office 
should not be barred from prosecuting Morrow on the criminal charge. 
</P>
<P>
 Fielder had argued that the eavesdropping incident violated Morrow's right to 
privacy and that the district attorney's office should not be allowed to 
prosecute the case because of a conflict of interest. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident, she said, had probably "raised the animosity level and attitudes 
against Mr. Morrow by all attorneys in that office." 
</P>
<P>
 Morrow, accused of breaking into a Port Hueneme motel last September, is 
scheduled to go on trial Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to dismissing the two defense motions, Campbell on Friday also 
found that Investigator Katherine Smith did engage in "purposeful 
eavesdropping" at the direction of Deputy Dist. Atty. Stacy Ratner. And that 
Smith told Ratner statements she overheard regarding a witness in the case and 
Morrow's decision to go forward with a trial. 
</P>
<P>
 For the second day in a row, Ratner was called as a witness and refused to 
answer questions under her Fifth Amendment right not to incriminate herself. 
Ratner and Smith were charged with felony easvesdropping May 20, but the 
charges were dropped Wednesday by Superior Court Judge Lawrence Storch because 
the pair did not use an electronic listening device.  
</P>
<P>
 Fielder said she plans to appeal Campbell's decision not to dismiss the 
criminal case against Morrow. "I would expect it would happen in the next few 
days," she said. "I think our appellate court will be happy to have this case."

 A 13-year-old Port Hueneme girl who was struck by a hit-and-run driver was 
hospitalized in good condition Friday night, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, Missey States, was crossing Ventura Road in the crosswalk when she 
was struck by a car that was turning off Bard Road, said investigating officer 
Ron Burns.She was with a friend, who was not injured in the 2:20 p.m. incident. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was terrified," Burns said. "She was dragged 40 feet by the car." 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the car, identified by Port Hueneme police as Larry Fisher, 49, 
of Oxnard, was arrested a block from the scene on suspicion of driving under 
the influence and felony hit and run. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokeswoman for St. John's Regional Medical Center said the girl suffered 
multiple scrapes. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns said Fisher reportedly got out of the car and looked at the girl after 
she was struck. A security officer at the Port Hueneme naval base witnessed the 
accident and responded almost immediately. Burns said Fisher then got in his 
car and began to drive away.MARY F. POLS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: CAMARILLO; 2 ARRESTED IN THEFT OF INFANT CLOTHING

 Two Santa Ana residents were being held in Ventura County Jail on Friday on 
burglary charges after a sheriff's deputy found stolen clothing in their truck 
during a traffic stop. 
</P>
<P>
 Marco Baltazar, 26, and Enrique Diaz Hernandez, 21, were arrested Thursday on 
burglary charges after they were found with $281 worth of stolen baby clothes 
from Cute 'N Cuddly Baby Fashions in Camarillo, Detective Tim Lorenzen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez faces an additional charge of drug possession after deputies found 
about a half gram of heroin on him, Lorenzen said. 
</P>
<P>
 Baltazar, who escaped from a sheriff's patrol car and had to be tracked down 
by helicopter, was also booked for evading arrest, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 The pair apparently stopped at the Camarillo baby shop shortly before their 
arrest at 3:45 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 One distracted a clerk, while another stuffed goods into a bag and then ran, 
said shop owner Lee Gardens. 
</P>
<P>
 "They came in and split up, then grabbed and ran," Gardens said. "Terrible 
thing." 
</P>
<P>
 As they made their getaway, they were stopped by Sheriff's Deputy Mark Criger 
at a nearby intersection for an traffic violation, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 When the pair gave conflicting statements about their identification, they 
were arrested for providing false information to an officer, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Further investigation turned up the stolen clothing and heroin, Lorenzen said. 
 
</P>
<P>
 While handcuffed in the sheriff's patrol car, Baltazar managed to escape, 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 He was found a short time later hiding in the back yard of a nearby home, 
authorities said. KAY SAILLANT

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: ORTHODONTIST TO RUN FOR COLLEGE DISTRICT 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Thousand Oaks orthodontist on Friday announced his candidacy for a seat on 
the board of the Ventura County Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Norman Nagel is running for the trustee position being vacated by Dr. 
Gregory Cole in Area 2, which includes Thousand Oaks, Westlake, part of Port 
Hueneme and the Santa Rosa Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a culmination of my children having gone through Moorpark College and 
my wife getting her nursing degree from there as well," Nagel said. "I really 
felt that they were receiving a good education. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yet, as we look to the future and see the fiscal constraints facing the 
business and educational communities, I want to somehow give assistance to the 
district." 
</P>
<P>
 His four children all took classes at Moorpark before going on to other 
colleges and universities. 
</P>
<P>
 Nagel has offices in both Thousand Oaks and Simi Valley. He is on the faculty 
of the UCLA School of Dentistry and is a credentialed teacher with the Simi 
Valley Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 He said his practice would not be affected if he is elected. "I've been in the 
Navy reserves for 30 years and I'm retiring from that," Nagel said. "So 
frankly, that is going to free up a lot of those weekends." MARY F. POLS

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: THORNTON JURY NOT TAINTED, JUDGE RULES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Extensive background checks on grand jurors did not create a biased panel or 
taint an indictment against Mark Scott Thornton, who is accused of killing a 
Westlake woman, a judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura County Superior Court Judge Charles R. McGrath rejected a motion by 
defense attorneys that prosecutors had unfair influence over the grand jury 
because of background checks performed by investigators with the district 
attorney's office. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say Thornton, 19, of Thousand Oaks kidnaped and fatally shot 
Westlake nurse Kellie O'Sullivan during a carjacking. The Ventura County grand 
jury indicted him Dec. 6 on a variety of charges, including a special 
circumstance that makes him eligible for the death penalty. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Susan R. Olson argued that the background checks 
violated the principal of separation of powers between prosecutors and judges. 
</P>
<P>
 But McGrath rejected Olson's argument and said the background checks were 
necessary to help judges choose a qualified panel of grand jurors. JULIE FIELDS

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; BOY'S SURVIVAL A MIRACLE, SAY DOCTORS, 
FAMILY

 First the doctors thought that 4-year-old Joshua Smith would die. 
</P>
<P>
 Then they told his parents he would have serious brain damage. 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, six days after he was pulled unconscious and slightly blue from 
the bottom of a Simi Valley neighbor's pool, Joshua is back home, smiling and 
playing with his brothers while he awaits physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident happened when Joshua, who was playing with his brothers and 
friends in a pool owned by neighbor James Neal, apparently went back into the 
pool after the other boys had gotten out and Neal went inside to answer a 
doorbell. When Neal came back out a few minutes later, he could not find 
Joshua. 
</P>
<P>
 Because there was sediment in the pool, the boys did not see Joshua. After a 
brief search around the house and yard, Neal jumped into the pool and found 
Joshua near the drain in the deep end.  
</P>
<P>
 Joshua's parents say his recovery is a miracle. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first saw him laying there," said Joseph Smith, Joshua's father, "he 
wasn't breathing and we could see water coming out of his mouth and all -- he 
was under water for a while -- and all we could do was start praying. I was 
scared, but we have a strong faith in God, and that's who we put our hope 
into." 
</P>
<P>
 For a few hours, the family did not know if Joshua would survive, and it took 
several hours before he began breathing on his own, his father said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua's 11-year-old brother, Joe Jr., said he was sitting in the waiting room 
next to his mother and two other younger brothers when the doctors told his 
father that Joshua was breathing. 
</P>
<P>
 "You could hear him yell from the hallway, 'Yes!'," Joe said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua was taken by helicopter to Kaiser Foundation Hospital in Los Angeles, 
where he was admitted to the pediatric intensive care unit.  
</P>
<P>
 Despite the temporary ray of hope when he started breathing again, Joshua fell 
into a deep coma and doctors told his parents that he would probably die. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we went down there, I was calm," said Marnice Smith, Joshua's mother. "I 
had been in deep prayer and I felt that God was with him. The social worker 
thought something was wrong because I was so calm, but I just knew God was with 
him every step of the way." 
</P>
<P>
 The boy woke up two days later, and although he could not speak and lacked 
coordination, his mother said Joshua recognized her, smiled at his family and 
tried to sing songs from the Barney television show. 
</P>
<P>
 "The diction was not all there, but he sang all the parts," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joshua came home Thursday night. He has trouble walking and standing on his 
own, and will be readmitted to Kaiser Hospital on Monday for physical therapy. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother plans to taking time off from her sales job with North American Van 
Lines to stay with him in the Los Angeles hospital, and his grandmother flew 
out from Chicago on Friday afternoon to take care of Joshua's three brothers.  
</P>
<P>
 Members of El Shaddai Christian Center in Simi Valley, where the family 
attends church, continue to pray for the boy and offer their help to the 
family, Joshua's mother said. 
</P>
<P>
 The doctors, who were impressed enough to call his recovery from near-death a 
miracle, have told the family not to expect that he would come back to his old 
self, but the family remains optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can already tell he's determined to get back to normal when he tries to 
play with his brothers," his mother said. "It's truly a miracle, and I know the 
Lord is not going to forsake this boy." SCOTT HADLY

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: MOORPARK; CORPORATE PLANNER SEEKS EDUCATION SEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Saying he wants to push for more technology education in schools, corporate 
planner David Pollock announced Friday he will run for a spot on the Moorpark 
Board of Education this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The terms for board members Pam Castro and Gary Cabriales expire in November, 
and school officials said both probably will run to keep their seats.Pollock, 
33, who works for Rockwell International, said he probably would serve with 
either Castro or Cabriales after the election and did not want to be critical 
of the board. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the last five years, this district has grown dramatically," he said. "And 
I guess if I was going to say anything critical, it would be that I want to see 
more professionalism on how the district runs its business." 
</P>
<P>
 For two years, Pollock has served as chairman of a 29-member committee set up 
by the board to study the effectiveness of schools in Moorpark. Many of the 
recommendations made in January by the committee -- including those to 
institute school choice in Moorpark -- were adopted by the district for the 
coming school year. In June, 1993, Pollock vied with five other candidates for 
a school board appointment when board member Sam Nainoa resigned. He lost to 
Cabriales. 
</P>
<P>
 Pollock has lived in Moorpark with his family for five years. Pollock, who has 
two children attending Moorpark's Peach Hill Elementary School, said his 
children are the main reason for his involvement in the school district. SCOTT

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: THOUSAND OAKS; SCHOOL BOARD OKS 5% HIKE IN BUS FARE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Riding the bus to school in Thousand Oaks will be a little more expensive this 
fall. 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Valley school board on Thursday unanimously approved a 5% increase 
in school bus fares.A semester's worth of round-trip rides will now cost $190, 
up from $180 this school year. One-way rides for a semester will cost $100, up 
from $95. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials said the fare hike was necessary to cover inflation. The 
Conejo Valley Unified School District began charging parents for bus service in 
1992 as a way of recouping $600,000 spent on transportation from the district's 
general fund. Even with the higher fees, the district still expects to 
subsidize bus service by about $20,000 next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Special-education students do not pay for bus service, nor do students who 
qualify for free or reduced-fare rides. About 6% of the district's 17,000 
students rely on school bus service, officials said. JULIE FIELDS

OUTGOING MAYOR OUTLINES HER 28 ACCOMPLISHMENTS; THOUSAND OAKS: ELOIS ZEANAH 
PLANS TO PAT HERSELF ON THE BACK. BUT FOES DISAGREE WITH SOME CITATIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the city's regular leadership shuffle, Thousand Oaks Mayor Elois Zeanah on 
Tuesday will hand her title, her chair and her ceremonial gavel to veteran 
Councilman Alex Fiore. 
</P>
<P>
 But first, she intends to give herself a hearty pat on the back. 
</P>
<P>
 Never one to play wallflower, Zeanah plans to end her nine-month stint as 
mayor with a rhetorical flourish -- a glowing speech reviewing her tenure and 
recapping her successes. 
</P>
<P>
 So far, she's typed up a list of 28 achievements, all backing her oft-repeated 
promise to "challenge our business-as-usual models." 
</P>
<P>
 Her political foes offer their own challenges, noting that some of the changes 
Zeanah cites as milestones of her mayoral term were actually initiated years 
ago. A program to help low-income renters buy homes in the Las Casitas 
neighborhood, for example, was launched during Zeanah's term, but had been 
planned months before she took office. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Zeanah sticks by her record. 
</P>
<P>
 "I set out a very ambitious plan and I'm awe-struck at how much we've done," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, Zeanah has achieved most of the goals outlined in her inaugural 
speech last fall. Her biggest accomplishments include: 
</P>
<P>
 * Founding the Mayor's Business Roundtable, which has proposed several 
initiatives to cut red tape and boost the local economy. 
</P>
<P>
 * Organizing a Crime Symposium, which brought residents together to develop a 
community-wide strategy for keeping Thousand Oaks safe. 
</P>
<P>
 * Developing an electronic bulletin board which will allow residents to tap 
into City Hall through their computers. 
</P>
<P>
 * Appointing citizens, for the first time, to the council committee that deals 
with affordable housing. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to complete her agenda, Zeanah said she hopes to use her clout as a 
council member to fight for a few remaining goals. 
</P>
<P>
 First and foremost, she said she wants to write a law that would force all 
developers' lobbyists to register with the city and disclose every meeting with 
council members or staff. Zeanah also plans to develop a user-friendly manual 
explaining the city's budget, so residents can trace their tax dollars through 
the system. 
</P>
<P>
 Those initiatives will have to wait a bit, as Zeanah takes next week to 
reflect on her triumphs. 
</P>
<P>
 Her fellow council members, however, will not let her bask unchallenged. 
</P>
<P>
 They complain, for example, that during her term as mayor, Zeanah seemed 
powerless to stop the political cat fights that have come to characterize the 
Thousand Oaks City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's really unable to control the bickering," Councilman Frank Schillo said. 
"People are laughing at us . . . because the mayor is not able to control the 
meetings." 
</P>
<P>
 Zeanah's foes also grouse about some of her tactics, such as her decision to 
establish the Mayor's Business Roundtable without first seeking council 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 "She certainly did a lot of things her way, and her way was not necessarily 
the way the council has operated effectively in the past," Councilwoman Judy 
Lazar said. "Her way was effective to accomplish her goals, but it didn't bring 
the council together." 
</P>
<P>
 In defense of Zeanah, Councilwoman Jaime Zukowski said she believed no one 
could have united the ever-contentious council. "But she chaired and managed 
the meetings in an exemplary manner," Zukowski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zukowski should soon get her own chance to test out the mayor's gavel. She is 
expected to be elected mayor pro tem on Tuesday, and will be chairwoman of 
council meetings when Fiore is absent. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Fiore has set out just a few simple goals for his term as mayor, 
which will wrap up a 30-year political career. He wants to keep the meetings 
short and generate enthusiasm about October's grand opening of the Civic Arts 
Plaza. 
</P>
<P>
 And he's not planning any long inaugural speech on Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll probably just say 'thank you,' " he said.

SCHOOL RESTRUCTURING IDEA OPPOSED; WESTLAKE HIGH: TRUSTEES TOLD THE PRINCIPAL 
HIS PLAN WOULD GIVE STUDENTS TOO MUCH FREEDOM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A plan to restructure Westlake High School's class schedule has come under 
fire by Thousand Oaks school board members who say it leaves students free to 
roam or leave campus with no supervision. 
</P>
<P>
 Although they did not vote on the plan proposed during Thursday's meeting of 
the Conejo Valley Unified School Board, all five trustees opposed parts of the 
plan presented by Westlake Principal Curt L. Luft. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see anything in here that's going to be easy to do or attract what 
you think it's going to attract," Trustee Richard Newman told Luft and two 
other Westlake staff members. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the board's criticism was directed at a proposed "A period" that would 
give students 41 minutes every Thursday afternoon and Friday morning to seek 
academic help, counseling assistance or to work on school projects, such as 
science labs. 
</P>
<P>
 Luft said the open period would also give teachers time to coordinate lessons 
tying together several subject areas. Parent volunteers, he said, would be 
recruited to help monitor the campus. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan also called for students to attend a daily homeroom and two days of 
longer 95-minute classes, similar to a "block schedule" adopted by Newbury Park 
High School last fall. Longer classes, Luft said, would allow students to 
develop better relationships with teachers and become more immersed in academic 
lessons. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not saying this is the definite plan for Westlake," he said. "What 
we're asking for is for you to let us try it." 
</P>
<P>
 But school board members attacked the "A period" idea, saying it provided no 
organized way of keeping tabs on the school's 1,700 pupils. 
</P>
<P>
 Trustee Mildred Lynch said she feared many students would take advantage of 
the unstructured time and leave campus.  
</P>
<P>
 "How in the world are you going to keep track of them?" she asked. "And if you 
don't keep track of them, they're gone." 
</P>
<P>
 Newman said he feared that the open period would become an "attractive 
nuisance" and leave the district liable if unsupervised students were injured. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we have no idea where they are, I think we're really concerned from a 
legal standpoint," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Trustee Bill Henry blasted the overall presentation, saying it lacked 
enthusiasm and commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 At least one other Ventura County high school has tried setting aside certain 
periods of unstructured time. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura High School two years ago launched what it called "advisement 
periods," two 20-minute sessions weekly for students to meet with faculty or 
hold group discussions on such topics as moral values or improving study 
skills. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Ventura High faculty was split on the merits of the sessions and voted 
to cancel the periods midyear. 
</P>
<P>
 Westlake board members praised other aspects of the plan, developed by a 
committee of parents and teachers. Conejo Valley board member Dorothy Beaubien 
said she favored the daily homeroom and 95-minute classes. 
</P>
<P>
 Before a lengthy discussion on Westlake's plan, the board voted to allow 
Newbury Park High School to continue its scheduling experiment for a second 
year.

FRAUD AGAINST STOCKHOLDERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Re the May 26 editorial, "Targeting Rogues in White Collars": 
</P>
<P>
 The growing problem of individual investor abuse in America is not limited to 
greedy "rogue" brokers on the loose. Hardly. The blame for the continuing rise 
in investor abuse and resulting increase in requests for resolution and 
restitution via arbitration can be laid on the collective doorstep of the 
largest brokerage firms in the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Problems of risky securities (the "new" product of abuse -- collateralized 
mortgage obligations (CMOs) -- said to be the "limited partnership of the 
'90s"), lack of investor suitability ("know your customer"), misrepresentations 
(lying or failing to tell the whole truth), unauthorized trades (on the rise). 
These problems, and others, would not exist if the firms performed with care 
and diligence their job of investor protection and worked with their brokers to 
select and recommend to customers products that fit the goals and objectives 
specific to that investor. 
</P>
<P>
 First, require that each and every customer be provided a written 1-, 5-, 10- 
and 20-year "strategic plan of action" based on all the important criteria. 
Second, I have been advocating for years a "dollars-under-management 
compensation system" for broker pay whereby the broker is paid a flat 
percentage on all dollars under management each year, a percentage that 
increases for each year in the business and with the firm. This latter system 
quickly and effectively removes the conflict between the need for brokers to 
make sales of high-commission products and the real and mandated duty owed to 
investors, plus it will stem the tide of brokers switching from firm to firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Reform in the securities industry is necessary. The basic fundamentals need 
overhaul, from poor broker training to a new compensation system, from the end 
of proprietary product "pitches" to readable monthly statements. 
</P>
<P>
 But regulatory and legislative efforts are years away and, if brought, will 
meet with formidable challenges from Wall Street firms, the same firms that 
will steadfastly refuse to take meaningful voluntary measures at reform. If 
they still argue in arbitration that an 85-year-old widow is somehow suitable 
for long-term, non-liquid, high-risk limited partnerships (as they did recently 
in an arbitration), then one can be confident that they will need to be dragged 
"kicking and screaming" to meaningful, structural reform. And that is the "real 
world" practical fact.

CALIFORNIA WATCH; LOOKING INWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 California leads the nation in many categories -- the good, the bad and the 
ugly -- but it may not make the top 10 for self-reflection of the 
institutionalized sort. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, it wasn't until recently that the respected RAND Corp. of Santa 
Monica turned its attention to domestic and state issues after years of heavy 
work for the Pentagon.And it was only a few years ago that the Washington-based 
California Institute, with its emphasis on the workings and non-workings of 
California's congressional delegation, was born. 
</P>
<P>
 Some other organizations notably contribute to the state's understanding of 
its problems and its opportunities -- the Partnership 2000 group and elements 
of the UC system, to cite just two prominent examples; there are others of 
course. But on the whole, California has turned the microscope onto itself less 
often and systematically than, say, New York or Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
 This is why the generous grant by billionaire computer mogul William R. 
Hewlett to set up a nonpartisan think tank on the state's problems is welcome 
and tremendously timely. The state is reeling from one serious problem after 
another -- and not all of them are recession-driven. Some involve problems of 
our own making. Thus the Public Policy Institute of California, to be located 
at Stanford University and led by RAND executive David Lyon, is exactly what 
the doctor ordered. 
</P>
<P>
 William Hewlett is to be commended for pledging such a sizable sum -- $70 
million -- for such a valuable purpose. Now more than ever, California needs 
its brightest minds on the case.

FINALLY, SOME HELP FOR RWANDA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After more than two deadly months of inexcusable delays, Rwanda may finally 
get some help. This year there have been at least 2 million people killed 
there, solely because of their tribal identification. 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, stopping the slaughter isn't the mandate of the 5,500 African 
peacekeepers expected to go to the Central African nation under the auspices of 
the United Nations. At the insistence of an overly cautious Clinton 
Administration, the U.N. Security Council is directing the troops to protect 
Rwandans by setting up havens without ordering the soldiers to stop the 
massacres. 
</P>
<P>
 Mindful of the disappointing results of the massive and expensive U.N. 
intervention in Somalia, the Clinton Administration should express some 
caution. But the Administration imposed burdensome conditions that delayed the 
peacekeeping effort. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration acknowledges some of the killings as acts of genocide. But 
a broader recognition of the wholesale slaughter as genocide would require the 
United States and other nations to intervene under a 1948 international accord. 
Political semantics cannot disguise the Hutus' systematic elimination of 
Tutsis, the minority tribe that dominated Rwanda.

 When the first Hutu president, Juvenal Habyarimana, was killed in a suspicious 
plane crash April 6, his death triggered this latest round of bloodletting. 
Hutus, however, aren't the only killers. Last week, Tutsi rebels killed Roman 
Catholic clergy who were apparently members of the Hutu tribe. 
</P>
<P>
 Burundi's president, Cyprien Ntaryamira, also died in the airplane crash, but 
his death did not precipitate a mass attack. However, previous tribal rampages 
have claimed more than 200,000 Tutsis and Hutus in Burundi. 
</P>
<P>
 Crisis is common in Africa, so common that Zimbabwe President Robert Mugabe 
believes the Organization of African Unity ought to have an intervention force 
at its disposal. Mugabe is right. He is expected to call for a mechanism that 
would allow the OAU to ask countries to provide troops. In the meantime, Mugabe 
is one of 14 African leaders who is committing troops to Rwanda as part of the 
U.N. peacekeeping force. The peacekeepers, equipped with the weapons and 
logistical support they need, should arrive as soon as possible.

ALL ABOARD THE BUS OF HOPE; AND A PROMISING MOVE FOR VERMONT AVENUE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the economy of Southern California slowly improves, places like Leimert 
Park and the surrounding Crenshaw neighborhood ought to see an upsurge in 
commercial activity as merchants eye the stucco bungalows and small apartment 
houses with lush gardens out front, full of exactly the consumers they crave. 
But history would indicate otherwise. 
</P>
<P>
 These African-American areas' pleasant streets have far more vacant commercial 
space than, say, the similar Larchmont Village. The will has been there, but 
too often in South Los Angeles will has not been matched by financing. 
</P>
<P>
 The sheer normalcy of this and other neighborhoods, both richer and poorer, in 
South Los Angeles, Inglewood and Compton was the message of the second annual 
bankers' bus tour Wednesday, put together by Operation Hope. Four buses full of 
lenders, appraisers, community activists and journalists wound for three hours 
through an area roughly bounded by the Santa Monica Freeway, La Cienega 
Boulevard, the 91 freeway and the 710. They saw what tour leader John Bryant, 
founder of Operation Hope, was talking about: Homeownership creates pride. 
Pride creates secure neighborhoods. The best community "police" are additional 
homeowners. According to one study cited on the tour, about half of renters in 
South Los Angeles pay rent equal to a mortgage in their neighborhood. Since the 
federal Home Mortgage Disclosure Act requires lenders to strive to reflect the 
racial and ethnic makeup of communities in their loans, that makes South Los 
Angeles a good bet for regulatory as well as fiscal bottom lines. 
</P>
<P>
 A side benefit of homeownership is more small-business activity, since it's 
far easier to borrow on homes than to obtain a business loan. But the magnet 
developments, like the sparkling new shopping centers at Compton Boulevard and 
Alameda Street or Baldwin Hills/ Crenshaw, still need big lenders and big 
dreams. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those dreams is the development of a block-long strip of Vermont Avenue 
a few miles north of the new Century Freeway. The surrounding residential areas 
are a homeowner heaven of spacious one-story houses: here a Cape Cod, there a 
touch of Moorish, over there a Spanish stucco. But the lack of nearby retail 
development is eerie. 
</P>
<P>
 First Interstate Bank has dived into a commitment to coordinate and finance a 
$10-million-to-$15-million commercial/residential project on the site. The 
project, backed by City Council member Mark Ridley Thomas, has drawn some fire 
for including affordable housing with the commercial element, but the bottom 
line is that it is housing that draws the tax incentives. 
</P>
<P>
 Three Los Angeles-based design/construction teams were announced Thursday as 
finalists and community comment has been invited. May the best dreamers win.

IN A JAM OVER PEARL JAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We don't know whether Ticketmaster will have a serious antitrust problem with 
the U.S. Justice Department in the future, but the well-known, Los 
Angeles-based ticket firm would be the first to admit that it surely has a 
public relations problem now. 
</P>
<P>
 The popular Seattle rock quintet Pearl Jam has charged that Ticketmaster 
conspired to keep promoters from booking the band for a planned nationwide tour 
this summer. Pearl Jam's complaint, filed with the Justice Department's 
antitrust division, alleges that Ticketmaster pressured promoters to boycott 
the tour because the company opposed the band's desire to hold concert ticket 
prices to under $20 and limit service fees to no more than $1.80 per ticket. 
The Justice Department, for its part, confirms only that it is conducting an 
investigation into alleged anti-competitive practices in ticket distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 As anyone who has been to a concert lately can attest, 20 bucks is a bargain, 
especially to see one of the premier rock music acts in the country. Tickets 
for a typical concert in Southern California now are priced between $20 and 
$50, including service charges that can inflate the cost of a ticket by as much 
as $8. Seats for some well-known acts have sold for $100 and up. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the music business is a business. And Ticketmaster, which 
vehemently denies the allegation, has a point when it argues that promoters, 
along with individual music acts, should be able to base ticket prices on what 
the market will bear. Moreover, it's also true that consumers can bypass 
Ticketmaster by simply purchasing tickets from a venue's box office. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless there is a lot of discussion in the music industry about the 
relationship among ticket vendors, concert promoters and other parties and 
about whether that relationship contributes to higher prices for customers. 
</P>
<P>
 This new publicity about ticket inflation will no doubt revive the issue among 
lawmakers in both Sacramento and Congress. Whatever the outcome of the 
controversy, Pearl Jam has certainly brought the issue of ticket affordability 
to center stage.

CATHOLIC CHURCH'S STAND ON WOMEN PRIESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I agree that the Catholic Church is making a mistake in not allowing women to 
become priests (editorial, June 6). Women in all walks of life should have the 
same right as men to gain external power for themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 What too many women do not realize, however, be they nuns or politicians or 
police officers or whatever, is that, since the beginning of time, their 
femininity has empowered them in a much more important way than the Pope or 
society's laws can ever do. 
</P>
<P>
 I suspect that nuns, to a greater degree than priests, have influenced 
Catholic children and strengthened their faith. It is the wives and mothers who 
have anchored the family over the centuries, and it is probably no coincidence 
in these times when women are increasingly seeking the empty power of wealth 
and prestige and physical superiority that morality and compassion and concern 
for the rights of others are declining rapidly in our population. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 * It is the Pope's decree that women cannot be priests because there were no 
women apostles at the time of Christ, yet there was also no Pope at that time, 
but no one would suggest the office of Pope should not exist. 
</P>
<P>
 SHARON DAVIS 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 * The Pope insists that females should not be priests because Jesus chose 
males to be his apostles (May 31). Right -- and one betrayed him, another 
denied knowing him and the rest deserted him when he needed them most. 
Meanwhile, the women in his life remained by his side while he died on the 
cross. Maybe he made the wrong choice. 
</P>
<P>
 KAREN LINDELL

</P>
<P>
 * The latest gem from His Holiness is his unbending assertion that women will 
never be priests in the Catholic Church. To quote John Paul: "The church has no 
authority whatsoever to confer priestly ordination on women . . . ." 
</P>
<P>
 I find that justification to be rather contradictory, considering the Pope's 
previous pronouncements about women. For example, he had no problem ordering 
millions of Catholic women to abstain from using contraceptives. He also 
forbade his female followers to have abortions. The result is that millions of 
Catholic women are relegated to the status of breeding stock and fetal 
incubators. It also has condemned millions of children to be born to parents 
who either do not want them, or are incapable of providing a safe, loving 
environment for them to grow up in.

PAYING A ROYALTY FOR MINING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In your railing against the mining industry ("Every Mine a Gold Mine," 
editorial, May 19), you fail to mention a critical distinction between the 
royalty schemes proposed in the House mining bill and the Senate's version. 
More important than the 8% vs. 2% debate is whether the royalty should be based 
on the gross or net value of the minerals. 
</P>
<P>
 Critics of the industry like to point out that oil and gas companies pay 
federal royalties, so why don't mining companies? The fact is, miners have long 
conceded a willingness to pay a reasonable royalty. And the fairest calculation 
of the public's contribution to the value of raw ore is through a net royalty, 
which is the type of royalty paid by the oil and gas industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil and gas companies pay a royalty based on the value of their product at the 
wellhead, when it first emerges from the ground. Miners are simply asking for 
similar treatment by having their royalty applied at the mine mouth, when the 
minerals first emerge from the ground in raw ore form, and before any 
value-added processing occurs. 
</P>
<P>
 Oil and gas interests do not pay a royalty based on the price consumers pay at 
the pump. Why should miners be expected to pay a royalty based on the price of 
gold bullion -- which is what the gross royalty featured in the House bill 
would require. 
</P>
<P>
 Additionally, a net royalty will ensure the maximum extraction of mineral from 
public lands, which in the long run will be of greater benefit to both the 
government and the mine operator. 
</P>
<P>
 The difference is an exercise in pure economics. The mining industry has 
historically operated with very thin profit margins. The hard reality is that 
many mining companies simply cannot afford to pay a gross royalty and would be 
forced to close down their operations. That means lost jobs, lost wages and 
lost tax revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 The mining community has supported fair and reasonable reform of the mining 
law for well over a year and continues to support efforts in Congress to 
accomplish this goal. Unfortunately, Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt's cheap 
grandstanding in signing the Nevada patents was more a publicity stunt than a 
constructive gesture aimed at achieving balanced reform.

THIS FOURTH QUARTER GIVES ROCKETS A SPLITTING HEADACHE; NBA FINALS: KNICKS 
REGAIN THEIR SHOOTING TOUCH TO EVEN SERIES, 91-83, WITH NEXT THREE GAMES AT THE 
GARDEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By SCOTT HOWARD-COOPER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 They are fatigued. They weren't ready for the pressure defense on their 
guards. They are failing in the fourth quarter, when so many championships are 
won. 
</P>
<P>
 Has anyone mentioned to the Houston Rockets that this is the NBA finals and 
not training camp? 
</P>
<P>
 That bullet they dodged Wednesday circled back on Friday and didn't miss. The 
Rockets, who escaped in Game 1, paid for the fourth-quarter collapse this time 
with their home-court advantage, gone after the New York Knicks dominated the 
final 6 1/2 minutes to claim a 91-83 victory before 16,611 at the Summit and 
even the best-of-seven series at one game each. 
</P>
<P>
 "We probably gave the Houston Rockets a wake-up call," Knick Coach Pat Riley 
said. "The playoffs don't get interesting until the home team losses." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider them interesting. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets have staggered through the championship series, making only two of 
13 shots in the fourth quarter while holding on to win the opener and then 
making that seem like the varsity squad come Game 2. Amazing as it is, 
considering this is the biggest series of their lives, they need that wake-up 
call. An air-raid siren might -- might -- do the trick. 
</P>
<P>
 Or this might: 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockets led, 79-76, with 6:32 left. 
</P>
<P>
 The next 11 possessions resulted in five misses, including one airball, one 
trip to the line for two free throws and seven turnovers. To be more exact, 
they had two shots blocked by Patrick Ewing, threw two bad passes and had three 
other balls stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 By the time they regained conciousness, the Rockets trailed, 89-81, with 44 
seconds left. All that remained was to finish the game and a run of 12 
consecutive errant shots over that last 6:32. Then someone had to run and get 
the smelling salts. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel like we were not mentally ready for what they threw at us," Houston 
Coach Rudy Tomjanovich said. "And we talked about those things. Talk is one 
thing; reality is another." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Riley: "We take great pride in the fourth quarters. I thought the other 
night, we played strong. As soon as the guys started to sense we could win this 
game if we hit some shots, there was no fatigue factor on our part." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks have yet to cop the tired plea, even though they were the ones who 
went from back-to-back seven-game matchups to get into the finals on two days' 
rest. The Rockets, who had eight days off after breezing through the Western 
Conference finals against Utah, are fatigued. Worn out. 
</P>
<P>
 New York's guards can take partial credit. Noteworthy only in their absence in 
Game 1 while going a combined 10 of 41 from the field, they re-emerged Friday 
with big performances. 
</P>
<P>
 Derek Harper went from three of 10 to seven of 11, including four of six on 
three-pointers. Two of those long-range shots were especially significant, 
coming in the final 4 1/2 minutes of the game en route to 18 points and seven 
assists. Ewing, who had 16 points, 13 rebounds and six blocked shots, said it 
was Harper's best game since getting a release from purgatory in the Jan. 6 
trade that sent him from Dallas to New York. 
</P>
<P>
 John Starks went from three of 18, including two of eight on three-pointers, 
to six of 11 overall and three of four from long distance. He finished with 19 
points and nine assists in 40 minutes, looking more aggressive in the process 
by driving inside as well as pulling up. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was very patient, and that's what I have to be," Starks said. "I know 
sooner or later the ball is going to come to me and I'll get my shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Riley: "They didn't hesitate. Derek wasn't thinking about it. He caught 
the ball and stepped right into it." 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks shot 52.2%, a staggering figure for them. But of equal importance, 
Ewing and Anthony Mason, despite giving away five inches, combined to hold 
Hakeem Olajuwon to seven rebounds, one on offense. That's when 25 points 
doesn't seem so bad.  
</P>
<P>
 With that momentum, the Knicks head back to Madison Square Garden, where they 
are 9-1 in the playoffs. The Rockets should set their alarm for Sunday and Game 
3. After that, Game 4 is Wednesday and Game 5 is Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're just going to take it one game at a time," Ewing said. "We're not going 
to worry about momentum and all that. We're just going to home, where our fans 
are rowdy." 
</P>
<P>
 And their future suddenly brighter. 
</P>
<P>
 * ROCKET FAILURE

 Houston is playing just fine for 36 minutes -- unfortunately for the Rockets, 
the NBA game lasts 48. C4

MAGRANE REVERTS, ANGELS LOSE, 8-4; BASEBALL: AFTER A SOLID START AGAINST THE 
BREWERS ON SUNDAY, HE FIZZLES IN SHORT STINT AGAINST THE TIGERS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In his last start Sunday, Angel left-hander Joe Magrane was superb. Friday 
night, he was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he gave up one run and four hits in his first complete game in four 
years. Friday night, he gave up four runs and six hits with three walks, three 
strikeouts, three wild pitches and one hit batter. He didn't make it past the 
fifth inning and the Angels lost, 8-4, to Detroit at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he dazzled the Milwaukee Brewers with a firm command of his pitches. 
Friday night, he couldn't contain the Tigers, who homered for the 17th 
consecutive game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumping all the blame for this loss on Magrane, 2-3 with a 6.57 earned-run 
average, wouldn't be fair. This was only his seventh start since returning from 
elbow surgery Feb. 8. Besides, there were plenty of other reasons why the 
Angels lost for the sixth time in eight games on this 10-game home stand. 
</P>
<P>
 But inconsistent pitching continues to overshadow all other Angel problems. 
Five wild pitches -- relievers Mark Leiter and Mike Butcher had the other two 
-- stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 Chuck Finley struggled against Detroit on Thursday, losing for the second time 
in his past three starts. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Finley's four victories lead the staff and his 4.61 ERA is the 
lowest among the starters. 
</P>
<P>
 Angel Manager Marcel Lachemann knew better than to expect another complete 
game from Magrane. He was only counting on seven innings from him on Sunday; 
anything else was strictly a bonus. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lachemann did say he thought Magrane's confidence would be soaring when he 
took the mound for Friday night's start. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns would appear to be mounting for the listless Angels, who managed only 
seven hits against Detroit. But Lachemann said he's not a fan of team meetings 
and doesn't imagine holding court in an attempt to snap the Angels out of their 
slump any time soon. He prefers to handle things in a one-on-one setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meetings have their time and place, but it's like anything else," said 
Lachemann, who did hold a meeting when the club was in Toronto in late May. "If 
you're talking all the time, nobody will listen. I would rather deal with 
individuals. I will get (angry) once in a while and I wouldn't want my wife and 
kids around when I do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes quite a bit to get that far with me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are 3-10 since Magrane defeated Detroit and starter Mike Moore 
(7-4) on May 26 in Tiger Stadium. They are 2-7 in June, 8-12 under Lachemann 
and have fallen to a season-high 6 1/2 games behind American League 
West-leading Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 Is that enough to send Lachemann into a fit of anger? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, nothing could save Magrane from himself Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He left trailing, 4-2. Travis Fryman's two-run home run to right in the fifth 
gave the Tigers their lead. 
</P>
<P>
 By then Magrane had thrown 109 lackluster pitches and Lachemann believed that 
was plenty, summoning Leiter to start the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Leiter picked up where Magrane left off, walking Juan Samuel, who promptly 
went to second after a wild pitch sailed to the backstop. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Phillips followed with a sharply hit grounder that first baseman J.T. 
Snow couldn't handle and Samuel scored for a 5-2 Detroit lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Chili Davis' 11th homer of the season, a solo shot into the right field 
bleachers, cut the Tiger lead to 5-3 in the sixth.

DODGERS DON'T GET A CHANCE TO STUB TOES; BASEBALL: WITH DREIFORT, OSUNA WARMING 
UP, GROSS GOES THE DISTANCE AND BEATS CUBS, 2-1, ON WALLACH'S HOMER. 
</P>

 From about the fifth inning on Friday, Kevin Gross sat in the visitors' dugout 
at Wrigley Field when he wasn't pitching and applied heat to his shoulder. He 
did exercises in the tunnel to keep it loose and, later on, to try to get it 
loose.  
</P>
<P>
 He grimaced from the pain while he was pitching, and even jammed his toe in 
the ninth inning while covering first base. But it was clear that Gross did 
everything he could in the Dodgers' 2-1 victory over the Chicago Cubs, thereby 
completing a mission that nobody said, but everybody thought: 
</P>
<P>
 Go nine, young man. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll tell you who the best closer was; it was the guy who started the game 
today," Manager Tom Lasorda said in fielding the inevitable question, "Who's 
the closer?" 
</P>
<P>
 Gross, who had gone nine innings only once before in 12 starts this season, 
was working on a shutout until the ninth, when Sammy Sosa's two-out single 
drove in Derrick May. But Gross retired pinch-hitter Glenallen Hill on a 
comeback ball to the mound to (a) give the Dodgers their second victory in 
seven games on this trip, (b) hand the Cubs their 10th consecutive loss and (c) 
keep the Dodgers' beleaguered bullpen out of the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't think I have to go nine because our bullpen needs it," said Gross 
(5-3), who gave up seven hits, struck out five and walked one. "It's just a 
plus. That's what baseball is, picking each other up." 
</P>
<P>
 Even before Sosa's hit, it had appeared that Gross was finished for the day. 
On the previous play, Gross jammed his big toe covering first, and trainer 
Charlie Strasser dashed onto the field. Gross used the moment to his advantage, 
telling Strasser: "I think I stubbed my toe, but while you are out here, I'll 
take a rest." 
</P>
<P>
 It looked for a time as though Lasorda was going to be forced to go to the 
bullpen, which had blown three of the previous four games and has a record of 
11-15, a 4.66 earned-run average and nine saves in 24 chances, the worst 
percentage in baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't tell you what's going on (then) in my mind," Lasorda said. "A lot of 
things go through your mind. In that position as a manager, you have to think 
of everything, not that it will happen or to be negative, but to be prepared 
for whatever happens. So if it does, you can react." 
</P>
<P>
 For all the things Lasorda was thinking, Todd Worrell apparently wasn't one of 
them. With the game on the line and the tying run at first base, Lasorda had 
Darren Dreifort and Al Osuna warming up. It was a curious situation, 
considering that Worrell had once again been deemed the closer during a 
disciplinary meeting Friday with Lasorda and Executive Vice President Fred 
Claire -- but an understandable one. 
</P>
<P>
 Worrell has blown his last four save chances and five of the last seven, but 
his meeting concerned his insubordination in Wednesday's game against the 
Marlins in Florida, when he ignored Lasorda's message to hold the potential 
tying run on first base. The runner, Chuck Carr, stole second and eventually 
scored.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't put it in the major category, but it gets back to the basics," Claire 
said. "When a manager makes a decision how he wants to see the game played, 
then that's the way it should be played." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cub offense is struggling badly, but the Dodgers had even more trouble 
getting hits Friday. Their runs came in the sixth inning on Tim Wallach's 
two-run home run, one of four hits in eight innings against starter Steve 
Trachsel (4-4). It was Wallach's 15th homer this season and second in two 
games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not going to repeat this over and over every time I scuffle for a week 
and a half," said Wallach, who was asked to explain what he is doing now that 
he wasn't doing a week ago. "I'm just not chasing as many bad pitches. I was 
just rushing too much, not seeing the ball and trying to hit it too hard. 
Sometimes I get too overaggressive."

KEENAN SAYS RANGERS WERE TOO HYPED UP; STANLEY CUP FINALS: COACH BLAMES RUMORS 
AND EXPECTATIONS FOR GAME 5 LOSS TO CANUCKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Mike Keenan of the New York Rangers, claiming reports he will leave for 
a general manager/coaching position in Detroit had undermined his team's 
chances of clinching the Stanley Cup, said Friday he has no intention of 
relinquishing his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan, speaking after the team's late-afternoon practice at the Pacific 
Coliseum, blamed an overly heightened sense of anticipation for the Rangers' 
failure to win the Cup in New York on Thursday night. He also said rumors about 
his future had created an atmosphere of uncertainty that contributed to the 6-3 
loss to the Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The series will continue tonight at the Pacific Coliseum, where the Rangers 
won Games 3 and 4. A seventh game, if necessary, would be played Tuesday at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was so much hype, like that whole nonsense about me leaving New York," 
Keenan said. "There's no foundation to it. No truth to it at all. There's 
absolutely nothing to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why people (with the Rangers) haven't been able to win the thing for 
54 years. The hype is much greater in New York than any place else in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I saw the headlines (heralding a Ranger Cup victory), I knew we 
were in deep trouble. If I were (Canuck Coach) Pat Quinn, I wouldn't have had 
any trouble motivating my team. The New York media hype helped Pat motivate his 
club." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Keenan's players said the media were not the reasons for their 
defensive collapse late in Thursday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can find excuses if you look for them. I don't think it played any 
factor," left wing Adam Graves said. "We just didn't play the way we wanted to 
in order to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes things happen, and I don't think you can blame it on one thing or 
another. We as a team didn't play how we feel we have to in order to win, and 
we have to get back to that style. It happened for whatever reasons, and we're 
not looking (at the media) as an excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Said defenseman Brian Leetch: "It didn't have any effect. This team and the 
players have a lot of expectations of ourselves. . . . Vancouver came out and 
played desperate hockey, and we got away from the things we needed to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger captain Mark Messier called a team meeting after Friday's practice. 
Keenan and his assistants were not invited. 
</P>
<P>
 If their confidence is crumbling, Messier wouldn't say so.  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't really matter what we talked about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did say he and the Rangers felt no undue pressure from the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of attention is to be expected," he said. "It's a tough thing. 
There's a lot of pressure you play under, and that's why it's tough to win the 
Stanley Cup, because there are a lot of things you have to handle at this stage 
of the game. Hopefully, we can handle it better (tonight)." 
</P>
<P>
 Said forward Esa Tikkanen of the collapse: "We were too excited and we tried 
to do too much. They kept coming back and they broke our backs. The bottom line 
is we have to have 20 guys play 60 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks, who succeeded in bothering the Rangers with physical play -- and 
capitalized on the Rangers' loss of defenseman Jeff Beukeboom to a first-period 
ejection -- intend to target Leetch again because he is the Ranger catalyst. 
They hope to get the same kind of balanced scoring they got Thursday, when five 
line combinations produced goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Canuck center Trevor Linden: "In the first game we had a great 
goaltending performance from Kirk (McLean), but we really hadn't played well 
against them until (Thursday). We scored some goals and took it to them. I 
think it really reinforces and gives the guys a lot of confidence coming into 
(tonight)."

YOU MAKE THE CALL: HOW BAD IS OFFICIATING IN THE NBA PLAYOFFS? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How long will it take for someone to blow the whistle on the egregious 
corruption perpetrated annually by officials during the NBA playoffs? Year 
after year, critical games are determined by illegitimate referee decisions. 
</P>
<P>
 How much more obvious can it be than this year's Utah-Houston series, where a 
timekeeper gave the home team 10 extra seconds at the end of a game in what 
turned out to be a futile effort to pull out a close contest? And when an 
official calls a flagrant foul against the Pacers in the final seconds of a 
one-point game, one has to seriously question the integrity of the man with the 
whistle.

 Calling Reggie Miller's aggressive "love tap" flagrant is an affront to John 
Starks and all the other hackers in a league where these calls are reserved for 
plays that jeopardize eyes and limbs, if not careers. It is another flagrant 
example of refs not letting the players decide the games.

 Let's get this straight. Nobody owes Pat Riley or the Knicks a damn thing. 
Several seasons of being ousted in the playoffs when they supposedly should 
have moved on means nothing. Especially to those outside of New York. With two 
games practically given to the Knicks on questionable calls (in New York), how 
can Riley already be speaking in terms of "fate" and "destiny." Nobody owes you 
anything, Riley, and you'll find that out on the road in Houston.

 So Allan Malamud thinks this year's NBA playoffs have been "the dullest in 
recent memory"? 
</P>
<P>
 Let's recap some of the incredibly boring events that we have had to endure so 
far: The top-seeded team in the West is upset by the eighth seed. There have 
been record-tying comebacks (Houston over Phoenix); record-setting comebacks 
(Denver over Seattle); exemplary offensive performances (Barkley's 56, 
Olajuwon's 46 and Miller's fourth-quarter heroics); fights, bench-clearing 
brawls, fines and suspensions; a changing of the guard as the Bulls bow out, 
and, oh yes, some highly competitive basketball with a number of series being 
stretched to the limit. 
</P>
<P>
 If these playoffs are dull, I can't wait until they get interesting again.

BALLESTEROS EXEMPT FROM COMMON SENSE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 So Seve Ballesteros thinks he deserves an exemption to (play in) the U.S. Open 
more than Arnold Palmer. Why? Because of Ballesteros' career-long snubbing of 
the U.S. tour? Because he won the Sardine Open in Sardinia last week? Because 
of all he has done for golf in America? 
</P>
<P>
 Seve, I used to think you had some class. I hope you find every bunker and 
divot at Oakmont in your two rounds there. Then go home and win another Dutch 
Open.

<P>
 Golfers such as Seve Ballesteros and the rest of professional golf should be 
on their knees thanking Arnold Palmer for making the tour as lucrative as it is 
today. 
</P>
<P>
 Between Dwight D. Eisenhower and Palmer, golf took off like a rocket, and the 
players should be ever grateful. 
</P>
<P>
 So let the man have one last shot at the U.S. Open. If anyone deserves it, he 
does.

READERS KICK BACK ON SOCCER STORIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Plaschke ("Sole of the Matter," June 5) explained why we Americans don't 
like soccer. We never see articles explaining why we don't like track and 
field, swimming and diving, etc., but we've been told by countless columnists 
and commentators that we don't like soccer.Why does soccer merit this sort of 
cockeyed attention? Because, as Plaschke quoted Glenn Dickey of the San 
Francisco Chronicle, most sportswriters don't understand soccer, don't try to 
understand it and simply dismiss it as insignificant. 
</P>
<P>
 That's the U.S. sports media/soccer relationship in a nutshell. If soccer does 
reach its potential and becomes a part of this country's culture, that leaves a 
bunch of sports media members -- sports experts, if you will -- with absolutely 
nothing intelligent or insightful to say about this "new" sport.

 In response to Randy Harvey's article about England's failure to qualify for 
the World Cup (June 8), it should be noted that FIFA's geographic qualification 
system is not designed to produce the best 24 teams in the world. England, 
which at the time was ranked 10th in the world, was forced to compete with 
second-ranked Norway and sixth-ranked Holland for two spots in the finals. On 
the other hand, 16th-ranked Mexico's toughest competition was No. 38 Costa 
Rica, No. 39 Honduras and No. 46 Canada. I'm sure England would have gladly 
traded assignments.

 If the basket in basketball was so small that only a few points could be 
scored in a game, the NBA would have to pay me to watch. If the soccer folks 
are looking for something to make games more interesting, a larger goal might 
do it.

JUST HOW SPECIAL IS USC HALL OF FAME? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Congratulations to Bob Oates (June 5) for hitting the nail on the head 
concerning USC's new athletic Hall of Fame. Who are these 52 mostly younger 
voters who don't realize what made USC athletics legendary to begin with? It's 
too bad the average USC fan has no vote.They probably would have more insight 
and fewer problems remembering the era that put USC on the map.

 Thank you, Mr. Oates, for remembering USC football in the 1920s and 1930s. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles has always been a Trojan town, and it will always be a Trojan 
town.

 I marvel at the fact that Oates' indignation was directed at the inclusion of 
such players as O.J. Simpson and Frank Gifford, yet he was silent on the 
inclusion of Marv Goux, in the "special" category. Mr. Goux is pretty special, 
all right. From what I was able to glean from the May 5, 1982 Times, Mr. Goux 
sold student football tickets, leading to NCAA penalties against the Trojans. 
While USC may believe his motives were the purest, nevertheless it seems 
unusual that so many pivotal players (in Oates' estimation) were passed over, 
while the man responsible for placing USC on probation was honored.

THE NBA / MARK HEISLER; HOUSTON IN TROUBLE ON NEW YORK COURT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK HEISLER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fade in: A middle-aged man stands on the ledge of a high rise. Around one of 
his legs is a rope tied to an anvil. He is listening to a portable radio.  
</P>
<P>
 Radio: "Seconds left, Olajuwon shakes and bakes, he misses!"  
</P>
<P>
 Man, straightening up in anguish: "THAT'S . . . IT . . . I . . . JUST . . . 
CAN'T . . . TAKE . . . IT . . . ANY . . . MORE!"  
</P>
<P>
 He throws the anvil over the edge, and the rope begins to play out.  
</P>
<P>
 Radio: "But wait, he was fouled!"  
</P>
<P>
 Man looks plaintively into camera.  
</P>
<P>
 Voice over: "Because everyone knows it's not easy being a sports fan in 
Houston."  
</P>
<P>
 They just can't take it any more? Tough luck because, whoop, here it is again! 
</P>
<P>
 After the Rockets blew 18- and 20-point leads to the Phoenix Suns, and what 
fans consented to attend left booing, and Vernon Maxwell told the fans to go to 
hell, and the Rockets rallied, and the fans forgave them, the team started 
running the above commercial. 
</P>
<P>
 So what happened Friday night shouldn't have been a surprise. Whoop, there 
went another anvil. 
</P>
<P>
 Another fourth-quarter fold, another home-court advantage surrendered. The 
Knicks practically arrived in town borne on litters after barely surviving two 
seven-game series, but they left with a 1-1 tie with the next three games in 
Madison Square Garden where the Rockets will discover the true meaning of the 
words, "road games." 
</P>
<P>
 "All I say is here we go again," sighed Rocket reserve Mario Elie. 
</P>
<P>
 "More stress. But I know we're a good road team. I don't think they can beat 
us three straight road games." 
</P>
<P>
 Funny he should mention that. Actually, the Knicks will romp thrice unless the 
Rockets start playing the whole game. They've been out of college long enough 
to know they can't keep hitting the wall at 40 minutes but, whoop, there they 
went again. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday's last 6:32, they went 0 for 12 with five turnovers. In Game 1, they 
went two for 13 in the fourth quarter. In the two fourth quarters, they're 
seven for 37. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every game is a new game," insisted Rocket Coach Rudy Tomjanovich. "You've 
got to judge them individually. You can build those statistics, but I think 
other teams do the same thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the real answer is: We've got a superstar, Hakeem Olajuwon, and 
we're used to having him carry us and when he can't . . . uh, it's getting 
close in here, can someone open a window? 
</P>
<P>
 The Knicks' Pat Riley, a hard case, is trying to contain Olajuwon without 
double-teaming. He's succeeding because he has found a defender who can spell 
Patrick Ewing, the improbably matched Anthony Mason. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6-7, 250, this is not Mase in Your Face, as they like to say in the 
Gah-den, but Mase in Your Belly. But Mason has pushed Olajuwon off the block, 
cut him off when he has tried to shake and bake his way to the hoop and turned 
him into a jump shooter, a Dream the Knicks can live with. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the Knick rotation may be wearing Olajuwon down. In Game 1, he 
missed eight of his last nine shots. In Game 2, he got only eight shots in the 
second half. 
</P>
<P>
 Was that what Maxwell meant when he said "a couple of guys were fatigued?" 
</P>
<P>
 Said Maxwell: "I just feel that layoff hurt us a little, but I don't want to 
make excuses. I just feel like guys are tired. My own feeling, if guys are 
tired down the stretch, we need to sub a little more." 
</P>
<P>
 Olajuwon said he was fine and the important thing was they had to stick 
together. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenny Smith, the nominal team leader, sat out the fourth quarter while rookie 
point guard Sam Cassell ran the Rockets into a wall. Smith said he would like 
to have played more, and agreed that Cassell had had "a tough night," but the 
important thing was that they stick together. 
</P>
<P>
 A good guess is that Tomjanovich, experienced in Rocketry, warned them not to 
blow it now with one of their old choruses of I-should-have-been-in-there or 
Rudy-called-the-wrong-plays. So they head east united if endangered. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, New York will be a little different. The TV stations won't be 
devoting whole news programs to features on children painting signs at school, 
or Elie doing an appearance in Sugar Land, or Olajuwon's parents getting off 
the plane from Nigeria. 
</P>
<P>
 You poor Rockets. Gotham opens its pitiless arms to you. Whatever hard times 
you think you've known are about to be as nothing.

BASE STEALERS DISCOVER JOB IS GETTING TOUGHER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MILTON KENT, BALTIMORE SUN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here's a riddle: What do baseball catchers and police commissioners have in 
common? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Their jobs depend on keeping the theft rate down. 
</P>
<P>
 Lately, pilfering bases has been no laughing matter for base stealers, who are 
taking fewer and fewer chances and getting cut down when they do try to run. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's harder and harder every year. It seems like they keep coming up with 
something new to stop you," Baltimore Orioles outfielder Brady Anderson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trend is not new. 
</P>
<P>
 Since Vince Coleman stole 109 bases for the St. Louis Cardinals in 1987, only 
one player, the Oakland Athletics' Rickey Henderson, the all-time steals 
leader, has as many as 90 in a season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Florida Marlins' Chuck Carr won last season's National League steals crown 
with 58, the lowest total for an NL champion since the Cincinnati Reds' Bobby 
Tolan had 57 in 1970. 
</P>
<P>
 None of the current leaders -- not Cincinnati's Deion Sanders; Coleman, now 
with the Kansas City Royals; or two-time American League champ Kenny Lofton of 
the Cleveland Indians -- is on pace to steal 80 this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Last season, nine of the 28 teams had fewer than 100 steals. The average was 
1.44 per game. 
</P>
<P>
 This season, through the first 782 games, major-league teams had stolen 1,060 
bases, or 1.36 per game. 
</P>
<P>
 NL teams are averaging 1.38 with a 67 percent success rate; AL teams are 
attempting 1.36 with the same success rate. 
</P>
<P>
 One important reason for the decline of the steal is the decline of some of 
the stealers. Henderson and Tim Raines of the Chicago White Sox, who between 
them have won 15 stolen base titles, both will be 35 by season's end, which is 
especially old for base stealers, and both have been hobbled with injuries the 
past few seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, too, base-stealing championships are being won with fewer and fewer 
steals, to the point where Anderson, who stole 53 two years ago, predicts that 
65 to 70 bases, not 90 or 100, will be the benchmark to shoot for in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 The overwhelming favorite on the list of factors keeping base stealers and 
wanna-bes anchored is the increasing use of the slide step by pitchers. 
</P>
<P>
 The quicker delivery has helped such pitchers as Kansas City's David Cone and 
the Orioles' Ben McDonald, infamous for their inability to hold runners on, 
speed their delivery to the plate from 1.4 or 1.5 seconds to a more manageable 
1.2 or 1.3, thus keeping runners on a shorter leash. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've got to do it sometimes," McDonald said. "Guys like Lofton, Rickey, 
Coleman and (Kansas City's Brian) McRae make you aware, and it (the slide step) 
is an advantage. The catcher has no chance of getting some of those guys unless 
you use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Anderson: "Our pitchers are fanatic about it, and it helps a lot. They 
might lose some control using it, but not velocity." 
</P>
<P>
 There also seems to be a better brand of catcher working these days. The White 
Sox's Ron Karkovice, Texas Rangers' Ivan Rodriguez, San Francisco Giants' Kirt 
Manwaring and St. Louis' Tom Pagnozzi are all acclaimed for their ability to 
throw out runners. 
</P>
<P>
 "You got some catchers who can really throw, even if the pitchers aren't that 
quick, like when Johnny Bench was playing," said Lance Johnson of the White 
Sox, who stole a team-high 35 bases last year. "You (a pitcher) don't have to 
be as quick when you got a guy like Karkovice or Rodriguez from Texas that'll 
beat you." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson's teammate, Mike La-Valliere, who backs up Karkovice, points to 
baseball's offensive explosion as a factor, figuring "you've got an awful lot 
of guys hitting the ball out of the ballpark and you don't really want to run 
into too many outs." 
</P>
<P>
 For Davey Lopes, the Orioles' first base and base-running coach, the answer to 
baseball's base-running slump has little to do with slide steps or better 
catchers and much to do with a lack of aggressiveness. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just like you think when you're hitting, you have to think when you're on 
base," said Lopes, who won stolen base titles with the Los Angeles Dodgers in 
1975 and 1976. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to have that mentality. I don't think Lofton's afraid of anybody. 
That's the type of guy you have to be. (The Toronto Blue Jays' Roberto) Alomar 
and Rickey are the same way. It depends on the individual."

GOLF ROUNDUP; ELS ON UNFAMILIAR GROUND WITH A LEAD ON U.S. SOIL 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 South African Ernie Els shot a bogey-free 66 Friday to take his first 
tournament lead in the United States, a one-shot advantage midway through the 
Buick Classic. 
</P>
<P>
 Els' eight-under-par total of 134 at Westchester Country Club in Harrison, 
N.Y., left him one stroke ahead of first-round leader Mike Reid, who shot a 70 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Japan's Joe Ozaki had a 67 and was tied for third at 136 with John Wilson, who 
shot a 68. 
</P>
<P>
 Els, 24, has had success in major international tournaments, with top-10 
finishes at two British Opens, the 1993 U.S. Open and the 1994 Masters. A 
regular player on the European PGA Tour, he has played in 16 events on the 
American tour since 1990 and has won almost $80,000 in five U.S. tournaments 
this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred Couples, competing for the first time in three months because of back 
problems, had a 69 and was at 139. Greg Norman had a 67 and was among a group 
of five at 140. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Gibby Gilbert shot a seven-under 65 to take a one-shot lead after the opening 
round of the PGA Senior Tour Nationwide Championship in Alpharetta, Ga. 
</P>
<P>
 Bruce Devlin and Jim Albus each posted 66s, Devlin missing a share of the lead 
when he three-putted the final hole from 15 feet for bogey. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert recorded nine birdies, including a 35-foot putt on 17 and a 20-footer 
on 16. He missed a two-footer for a bogey on No. 3 and his other bogey came at 
15 when his 15-foot par putt failed to drop. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Geddes and Nanci Bowen shot five-under 67s to share the first-round lead 
at the Minnesota LPGA Classic in Brooklyn Park, Minn., and Beth Daniel, seeking 
her third victory in as many weeks, was three strokes back. 
</P>
<P>
 Daniel, winner of 29 LPGA events -- one short of qualifying for the LPGA Hall 
of Fame, was tied with eight others.

AMERICAN LEAGUE ROUNDUP; SABO GETS HIS MESSAGE ACROSS TO BALTIMORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chris Sabo made his point. 
</P>
<P>
 Upset because he hasn't been playing since being injured early in the season 
and losing his third-base job to Leo Gomez, Sabo has asked the Baltimore 
Orioles to trade him, though they signed him as a free agent only last winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabo has sat and talked to anybody who wanted to hear how unhappy he was. For 
the past eight days, he had little else to do. 
</P>
<P>
 So on Friday, the Orioles tried an experiment: Sabo, in the toughest left 
field in baseball, in front of Boston's Green Monster. 
</P>
<P>
 Put up or shut up. 
</P>
<P>
 He put up, hitting a two-run homer in a three-run eighth inning that gave 
Baltimore a 10-7 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 Sabo, playing in the outfield for the first time in the major leagues, had an 
assist, throwing out Scott Cooper at the plate in the seventh inning. He also 
handled John Valentin's one-hop shot off the wall in the first inning, fielding 
the ball with his bare hand and throwing a strike to second base, holding 
Valentin to a single. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm just happy to play," said Sabo. "I have no natural instincts in left 
field. I just picked up the ball and threw it." 
</P>
<P>
 He added that nothing had changed in his quest to move to another club to play 
third base. 
</P>
<P>
 Toronto 7, New York 2 -- Todd Stottlemyre pitched a six-hitter and John Olerud 
became the first left-handed batter to hit a home run off Jim Abbott (6-5) 
since 1991 with a three-run shot in the third inning to lead the Blue Jays at 
Toronto. 
</P>
<P>
 Stottlemyre (5-3) has yielded only two earned runs in his last three starts. 
</P>
<P>
 The Yankees have lost four in a row and 10 of their last 12. 
</P>
<P>
 Minnesota 8, Chicago 6 -- Alex Cole hit a two-run homer to win the game in the 
10th inning at Minneapolis after the Twins had rallied for five runs in the 
ninth to tie it. 
</P>
<P>
 Milwaukee 7, Cleveland 6 -- B.J. Surhoff hit a two-run double to cap the 
Brewers' three-run rally in the ninth inning at Milwaukee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Indians' Eddie Murray moved past Babe Ruth on the all-time hits list with 
a double in the sixth inning at Milwaukee. Murray has 2,874 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Texas 3, Kansas City 2 -- Doug Strange's single with two out in the seventh 
inning drove in the go-ahead run at Arlington, Tex., and the Rangers won their 
fourth game in a row. 
</P>
<P>
 In the seventh, Will Clark drew a leadoff walk against Kevin Appier (5-6) and 
Juan Gonzalez singled. With two outs, Strange hit a soft liner to score Clark. 
</P>
<P>
 Oakland 4, Seattle 3 -- The Athletics took a 2-0 lead into the ninth inning, 
with closer Dennis Eckersley on the mound, but Tino Martinez homered and Luis 
Sojo singled in Eric Anthony to tie the score when this edition went to press.

NATIONAL LEAGUE ROUNDUP; ROPER HAS ROCKIES' NUMBER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Take John Roper, add the Colorado Rockies and serve in Riverfront Stadium and 
the result is tasty in Cincinnati, unpalatable in Denver. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rockies have never won at Riverfront, running their record to 0-9 Friday 
with a 10-4 loss to the Cincinnati Reds. 
</P>
<P>
 Roper has never lost to Colorado, winning for the fourth time. He is 2-0 with 
a 3.07 earned-run average against the Rockies this year. 
</P>
<P>
 He has never beaten another National League team and is 0-5 with a 5.96 ERA 
against the rest of the league. Go figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't evaluate them," said Roper, who gave up nine hits and three runs and 
struck out four in 7 1/3 innings. "All I can do is go out and pitch. I can't 
tell you what those guys are thinking." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Colorado Manager Don Baylor: "I don't know. I'm trying to figure it out. 
I'm still trying to find out." 
</P>
<P>
 The only time the Rockies did anything against Roper was when he tired in the 
eighth inning. They cut it to 6-4 with solo homers by Dante Bichette and John 
Vander Wal off Roper and Vinny Castilla off Hector Carrasco. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh 5, Florida 4 -- Brian Hunter helped the Pirates break out of an 
extended offensive slump with a homer and three RBIs at Pittsburgh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Pirates, batting .195 in their previous 10 games, had 10 hits by the third 
inning against Chris Hammond (4-4) -- their first 10-hit game since May 29 -- 
to win their third in a row and fifth in seven games. 
</P>
<P>
 Pittsburgh finished with 12 hits. 
</P>
<P>
 Atlanta 5, Houston 2 -- David Justice hit a three-run homer and John Smoltz 
(4-6) pitched three-hit ball for seven innings as the Braves won at Houston. 
</P>
<P>
 Justice connected with two out in the fifth inning off Doug Drabek (8-3) for 
his eighth home run and a 5-0 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Houston's streak of consecutive innings without an error ended at 103 when 
second baseman Craig Biggio misplayed Justice's grounder in the fourth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Montreal 6, New York 4 -- Moises Alou homered for the fifth time in five games 
and the Expos won at New York for their eighth victory in 11 games. 
</P>
<P>
 Alou, who homered twice and drove in five runs Thursday against the Mets, hit 
a two-run homer and an RBI single Friday. The Mets have lost four in a row and 
nine of 11. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis 4, Philadelphia 3 -- Pinch-hitter Luis Alicea hit a three-run homer 
in the seventh inning at Philadelphia as the Cardinals ended the Phillies' 
four-game winning streak. 
</P>
<P>
 St. Louis trailed, 3-1, when Tom Pagnozzi drew a one-out walk from Mike 
Williams (2-3) in the seventh. Jose Oquendo singled and Alicea, batting for 
pitcher Rick Sutcliffe (3-2), hit his second home run of the season. 
</P>
<P>
 San Diego 5, San Francisco 2 -- Rookie Joey Hamilton (3-0) stopped the Giants 
for eight innings at San Francisco. Tony Gwynn (.378) drove in three runs and 
scored twice for the Padres.

ZIFFS' COMPUTER MAGAZINE HOLDINGS PUT ON THE BLOCK; PUBLISHING: SPIRITED 
BIDDING TO GAIN CONTROL OF TITLES SUCH AS PC WEEK IS EXPECTED. PRICE COULD 
REACH $3 BILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JONATHAN WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Ziff family has put its computer publishing empire on the block, setting 
off what promises to be a spirited auction for some of most promising 
information businesses in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziff Communications and its principal subsidiary, Ziff-Davis Publishing Co., 
dominate the computer publishing field with titles such as PC Magazine and PC 
Week, and have moved aggressively in recent years into trade show production, 
on-line computer services and other information industry niches. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the company, with revenue of about $1 billion, could fetch 
anywhere from $1.5 billion to $3 billion, and a long list of major media and 
communications firms are expected to be interested. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision to sell was made by the three young Ziff brothers -- Dirk, Robert 
and Daniel -- who own the company founded by their grandfather in 1927 and 
built into a powerhouse by their father, William Ziff Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 Dirk, 30, and Robert, 27, will now focus on the family investment business, 
Ziff Bros. Investments, which already has more than $1 billion in assets from 
the 1984 sale of 24 Ziff-Davis magazines. Daniel, 22, is a student at Columbia 
University. 
</P>
<P>
 "We decided a couple of months ago that publishing was not the way we wanted 
to spend the rest of our careers," Dirk said. The family had always believed 
that absentee ownership was not appropriate, he said, so the decision was made 
to sell. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ziffs have retained Lazard Freres & Co. to find a buyer. Steven Rattner, 
the Lazard partner handling the deal, said that ideally the company would be 
sold in one piece, but it could be broken up into a few chunks if necessary to 
"maximize value." The family hopes to complete a deal by year's end. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziff's two biggest direct competitors, International Data Group and CMP 
Publications, have been excluded as possible suitors, Dirk Ziff said. But other 
large magazine publishers -- notably K-III Holdings, Advance Publications, 
McGraw Hill, Reed Elsevier of Britain, Thomson of Canada and Bertelsmann of 
Germany -- are expected to show keen interest. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, some believe that companies outside of publishing, including the 
regional Bell telephone companies and even Walt Disney Co., might view the Ziff 
properties as a way to gain a strategic position on the much-hyped information 
superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 Ziff has excellent connections in nearly every corner of the computer world 
through its magazine and trade show businesses. And its new on-line service, 
dubbed Interchange -- which sources say cost about $75 million to develop -- is 
more technically sophisticated than established services such as Prodigy and 
America Online. 
</P>
<P>
 The sale will end one of the most remarkable stories in American publishing. 
Bill Ziff Jr., who took control of the company at age 23 following the death of 
his father, built the company into a dominant force in special-interest 
publishing, with titles ranging from Popular Photography to Modern Bride. 
</P>
<P>
 But in the early 1980s, he was diagnosed with prostate cancer, and with his 
sons too young to take over, he decided to sell. In 1984, CBS bought 12 
consumer magazines for $362.5 million, and Rupert Murdoch's News Corp. 
purchased 12 trade publications for $350 million. All that remained was small, 
money-losing PC Magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 But Ziff's cancer went into remission, and he proceeded to build a second 
empire -- without using any of the money from the earlier sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly before his father's retirement last year, Dirk Ziff indicated in an 
interview that he was interested in spending more time on the investment 
business; he resigned his post as vice president of operations at Ziff-Davis 
earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Ziff, however, has a keen interest in computers and has long been 
closely involved in the Ziff-Davis magazines. Family members agreed Friday that 
it was Robert's change of mind about being a magazine publisher -- and the 
brothers' desire to remain partners -- that led to the decision to sell the 
company. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always had more interest in publishing," Robert said. "But the thing that 
happened that changed my mind is that I did it for a year again (after 
attending law school) and I realized it wasn't playing to my strengths." Ziff 
Communications 
</P>
<P>
 * Owners: Dirk, Robert and Daniel Ziff -- the sons of Chairman Emeritus Bill 
Ziff -- and trusts they control own about 90% of the company. Remaining 
interests are held by other family members, including cousins Jim and Paul 
Stafford. 
</P>
<P>
 * Headquarters: New York 
</P>
<P>
 * Employees: 4,600 
</P>
<P>
 * Annual revenue: $1 billion

including PC Magazine and PC Week, with three more to be launched later this 
year. Publishes seven magazines in Europe and has licensed editions in 35 
countries. Also includes Cobb Group newsletters, a computer book publishing 
group, and Computer Intelligence Infocorp, a market research company.

BABY BELLS DON'T HAVE TO SHARE OFFICE SPACE; COMMUNICATIONS: FEDERAL APPEALS 
COURT RULES FCC CAN'T FORCE THEM TO PERMIT HOOKUP OF INDEPENDENT PHONE 
NETWORKS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JUBE SHIVER Jr., TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission cannot force local phone companies to 
give rivals space inside their central offices to hook up independent phone 
networks, a federal appeals court ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, which some saw as a setback for competition, was a victory for the 
regional Bell companies, which have been fighting with so-called competitive 
access providers for some time over lucrative business customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, the new competitors have been able to set up their equipment in 
phone company offices in order to route their calls directly to the local phone 
network. They can then sell cut-rate phone services to business customers, who 
account for the lion's share of phone spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruling, if it stands, means the competitive access providers will 
probably have to set up shop outside central phone company offices, which would 
raise their costs and reduce their competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 Associated Press quoted a senior FCC official as saying the agency will 
challenge the ruling, although a lawyer for the FCC said late Friday that the 
agency's general counsel was still reviewing the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in Washington came after six of the seven 
Baby Bells and several other local telephone concerns sued the FCC, arguing 
that granting space in their central offices to competitive access providers 
would compromise phone company security and amount to a taking of property in 
violation of the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court viewed this as a disruption of central offices, which are the nerve 
centers of telephone company operations and a key to maintaining the security 
and reliability of the network," said Mark L. Evans, who represented the Baby 
Bells and the other plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The court struck down a 2-year-old FCC rule requiring local phone companies to 
make space available for equipment needed to connect their customers' calls to 
the local telephone exchange, saying federal law "does not expressly authorize" 
such action. 
</P>
<P>
 Some experts said Friday's court ruling could slow the Clinton 
Administration's ambitious plans to spur modernization of the nation's 
telephone networks and communications infrastructure. 
</P>
<P>
 That's because local telephone company rivals will face higher costs hooking 
into the local phone network outside their central offices. What's more, 
competitors will lose some control over their networks where they hook into the 
local telephone exchange, because they will have to rely on the local phone 
company for maintenance of that equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a serious setback for competition," said Bradley Stilman, legislative 
director for the Consumer Federation of America, a Washington advocacy group. 
"It gives greater control to the local phone company and hinders the ability of 
others to compete." 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, he said, puts even greater pressure on Congress to pass 
legislation to set the ground rules for competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Central office equipment rooms are usually tightly secured areas where network 
switches are often individually partitioned and segregated with locked chain 
link fences to thwart vandalism and sabotage. The FCC rule would have given 
competitive access providers their own space in this central office area to 
install and maintain the equipment that hooked their independent phone networks 
into the main local telephone loop. 
</P>
<P>
 Local phone calls travel to a central office exchange, where they are routed 
through switches and multiplexers that deliver the calls to long-distance 
networks or other local telephone exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as New York-based Teleport Communications Group and MFS 
Communications in Omaha have invested hundreds of millions of dollars stringing 
high-capacity fiber-optic cable and sophisticated switches in urban areas in 
hopes of siphoning customers -- particularly business phone users -- from the 
Baby Bells. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nasdaq trading Friday, shares of Omaha-based MFS Communications Co. 
plummeted $3.75 to close at $24.875. Intermedia Communications of Florida fell 
75 cents to close at $13.25. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed with the ruling," said James Crowe, chairman and chief 
executive of MFS Communications. "It's going to cause confusion in the 
financial markets."

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; RAY CHARLES SHOW: NOT AS SHORT, DEFINITELY AS SWEET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM WASHBURN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Not that Ray Charles has a reputation for brevity or anything, but we did have 
a little pool going here at the office with folks placing estimates on just how 
short his show at the Orange County Performing Arts Center on Thursday would 
be. Those guesses ranged from 27 to 61 minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 For a fellow who professes that playing music is what he lives for, Charles 
sure doesn't do a lot of it in public. His concerts have indeed been as short 
as 27 or 35 minutes; on the best nights, you might get 55 out of him. 
</P>
<P>
 While one person exiting the $44 section of the Center on Thursday was heard 
to grumble, "Only an hour?" he didn't know how lucky he was. Not only did 
Charles deliver a relatively generous 62-minute show (not counting the four 
instrumentals his band played before he appeared), but a surprisingly soulful 
outing as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly at some of his O.C. club appearances, Charles has merely cruised 
through his hits on autopilot. At the center, though, he reaffirmed his title 
as "the Genius," and showed that, as was the case with Einstein's most 
challenging equation, genius needn't be long-winded. 
</P>
<P>
 His 13 songs gave anyone listening plenty to ponder. Charles is practically a 
one-man junction of the original popular music styles of this century. His 
career has spanned combo and big-band jazz, raw blues, R&B in all its 
permutations, country and rock. He, in turn, has had an incalculable influence 
on those forms. 
</P>
<P>
 And all of Charles' work, except perhaps his earliest, which was emulative of 
Nat King Cole, has been shaped by his singular spirit. 
</P>
<P>
 The way Charles moves on stage is clearly unfettered by the decorum of the 
sighted. His legs kick out spasmodically to the music, his frame rocks, emotion 
twists his face, unchecked by concerns of how he might appear. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, that is just the merest reflection of a greater abandon that 
characterizes his music on a good night. He takes his voice to places other 
singers -- particularly the sort that typically populate the center's stage -- 
studiously avoid. 
</P>
<P>
 His voice cracks; it whines; it grunts and cries. It's a voice that admits to 
weakness, that not only sings of lost love, but also does so with the sounds 
most of us only utter alone in our personal darkness. 
</P>
<P>
 It's a voice that also reaches for glory, with a radiance that's a glory in 
itself. As noted critic Henry Pleasants has put it, Charles' exultant singing 
has made him "one of the greatest of all gospel singers, without ever singing 
gospel!" 
</P>
<P>
 While one wouldn't want to trade his late '50s Newport Jazz Festival 
performances for his center show, it was still pretty marvelous. There were a 
few little-heard numbers in the set, and even songs he's been doing for three 
decades were given fresh turns and emotional insights. 
</P>
<P>
 Sporting a black, gray and white plaid sports coat, Charles was led on stage, 
but he led the way from there, his 17-piece orchestra responding to his every 
musical nuance. "I'm Busted" and "Georgia" -- songs he must have sung at least 
3,000 times apiece by now -- were rich in vocal asides, and his effortless 
slides into his falsetto voice on the latter tune could have made time stop and 
take notice. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Sinatra, his phrasing didn't so much illuminate words as it did reach 
to the emotion behind them. That was the case in his bringing out the heartache 
in his 1959 "Just for a Thrill." 
</P>
<P>
 It's a fairly maudlin lyric -- "You filled my life with joy / But I was merely 
your toy" and so on -- but he made it sob. When he chose to, he could also 
inhabit the lyric, as on Rodgers and Hammerstein's "Oh, What a Beautiful 
Morning," making that "The cattle are standing like statues" line vivid. 
</P>
<P>
 He was playing an electronic keyboard, and its varied palette -- including the 
sounds of piano, organ, vibes and pure '70s synths -- didn't make up for the 
greater expression Charles gets out of a real piano or even a Rhodes electric 
one. It also went glitchy on him in a couple of spots, prompting him to remark: 
"You never know about these things. Computers, you know." 
</P>
<P>
 Other songs included a strong reading of the '70s Leon Russell ballad "Song 
for You" -- his recent recording of the tune won him his 12th Grammy, in March 
-- and the 1988 "Stranger in My Own Hometown," co-written by Charles and Kenny 
Carr. 
</P>
<P>
 He brought on his five Raeletts to help him close out the show with "Don't 
Change on Me," "I Can't Stop Loving You" (marked by a long, playful intro) and 
a bluesy workout on "I Believe to My Soul." 
</P>
<P>
 The only letdown of the evening was the end: a pat, ventureless version of 
"What'd I Say" that did seem exhausted of emotion, and the brief instrumental 
snippet Charles let pass for an encore. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening singer Ernestine Anderson canceled due to illness and was replaced by 
comedian Lewis Dix Jr.

THE TOUR TAKES A NOCTURNAL DETOUR; ATTRACTIONS: UNIVERSAL STUDIOS WILL PERK UP 
ITS 30TH ANNIVERSARY WITH FIREWORKS, LASER SHOWS, UNUSUAL ENTERTAINERS AND LATE 
HOURS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 A juggler with a live chicken on his head. Magicians impaling themselves on 
swords. 
</P>
<P>
 Yes, a few things will change around Universal Studios Hollywood this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 The theme park will celebrate its 30th anniversary by undergoing a 
transformation each evening, parking its trams in favor of fireworks, 
laser-light shows and a smattering of unusual performers. "Hollywood Nights" 
will run from 8 p.m. until 1 a.m., marking the first time the park has stayed 
open late on a daily basis. 
</P>
<P>
 "The entire atmosphere will change," said Don Burgess, a Universal producer. 
"There will be live music and different kinds of food. We want it to be like a 
party." 
</P>
<P>
 This summertime make-over begins June 24, but guests can see another new 
attraction, "The Flintstones Show," beginning today. The musical picks up where 
the record-setting film leaves off, particularly in terms of special effects. 
Actors are whisked over the audience in a giant pterodactyl. A volcano shoots 
Fred through the rafters. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's complicated," explained Norm Kahn, the show's technical director. "We 
wanted to take you to a new place with the Flintstones." 
</P>
<P>
 The new attractions and new hours complement a strategy by which Universal has 
grown beyond its daytime tour to include restaurants and hotels, movie theaters 
and the CityWalk promenade. One executive calls it the "molding of the hill." 
</P>
<P>
 In the process, the park has become the region's second-most popular tourist 
attraction, according to a Los Angeles Convention and Visitors Bureau survey. 
Universal reports that approximately 8 million people visited last year -- 5 
million for the tour, 2 million for the theaters and another million for 
CityWalk. 
</P>
<P>
 Disneyland, by comparison, drew an estimated 11.4 million during 1993, 
according to Amusement Business magazine. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Universal would like to keep customers around so late that 
they'll decide to return for another day. 
</P>
<P>
 This is not the first time the park has ventured into the dark. Special shows 
have been offered on recent Halloween nights, for instance. But "Hollywood 
Nights" is far more extensive. 
</P>
<P>
 At the center of this after-hours project will be the "SpectraBlast" show with 
its futuristic video jockey at the controls of multi-shaded laser animation, 
pyrotechnics and 10-story water explosions. As mock DeLoreans mingle with UFOs 
overhead, a stuntman will be slung 150 feet through the air by something called 
a "reverse bungee." 
</P>
<P>
 In a nearby sound stage, a magic group called the Pendragons will perform 
elaborate tricks, including what Universal has billed as a "spellbinding 
impalement." Meanwhile, costumed monsters and street performers -- including 
the juggler and his chicken -- will stroll the park's walkways. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never done anything like this before," Burgess said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Flintstones Show" also represents a stretch for Universal, being the 
park's most expensive stage effort to date. To produce his special effects, 
Kahn summoned up the same technology that went into such nearby attractions as 
"Backdraft" and the $60-million "Back to the Future -- The Ride." 
</P>
<P>
 Universal took a gamble in planning this expensive attraction to open on the 
heels of the film. Park executives waited anxiously in the days before the 
movie's debut, worried that bad box office might cast a pall over their show. 
But record ticket sales have inspired Universal to hurry its production onto 
the stage two weeks ahead of schedule. 
</P>
<P>
 The 20-minute show features a large cast and a colorful, elaborate set. Park 
executives worked closely with Hanna-Barbera and Amblin Entertainment, which 
co-produced the film, to develop a complementary look and feel. Director 
Barbara Epstein did some curious homework to develop the story, which has Fred 
Flintstone discovered by director Oliver Stone and whisked by Pterodactyl 
Airlines to Hollyrock to make the world's first rock video. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watched every Flintstones cartoon," Epstein said. "They're on at 8:30 in 
the morning, I can tell you, and I watched them while I walked on my 
treadmill." 
</P>
<P>
 The show will run during the daytime and evening. Admission to the park covers 
both sessions. And to reinforce the suggestion that there is too much to 
experience in a day, Universal will begin offering two-day passes. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can stay here and do a lot of different things," said Jim Yeager, a 
Universal spokesman.  
</P>
<P>
 However, the traditional trams will continue to run their back-lot circuit 
during the day, presumably for those who aren't thrilled by the prospect of 
chickens, pterodactyls and self-mutilation. 
</P>
<P>
 * Universal Studios Hollywood, Universal City; 9 a.m. to 7 p.m. daily. Closing 
time extends to 1 a.m. on June 24. Tickets are $31 general, $24.95 for seniors 
and children ages 3 to 11. Two-day tickets are $50.50 general, $40 for seniors 
and children. Parking $6. (818) 508-9600.

WAR IS AT PEACE AS ITS MUSIC IS REBORN; POP BEAT: THERE'S RENEWED INTEREST IN 
THE SUPERSTAR BAND OF THE '70S AS IT ISSUES ITS 18TH ALBUM ON A NEW LABEL. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 "We're not that old . . . are we?" asks War's Howard Scott, poking in mock 
horror at what looked to be a middle-aged spread around his middle. 
</P>
<P>
 Sitting in the Westside office of the group's new label, he looks across at 
colleague Lonnie Jordan, who's smirking at him. Not only does Jordan remind him 
that the group, a superstar outfit in the early '70s, was formed in the late 
'60s, but that the keyboard player is the son of an original member, drummer 
Harold Brown. 
</P>
<P>
 "Get those rocking chairs ready," jokes Jordan, looking quite trim and fit at 
45 -- two years younger than Scott. 
</P>
<P>
 "Playing this kind of music does keep you youthful," explains Scott, pointing 
out that the band, which faded in the late '70s, has been playing clubs 
steadily all along. "You can't be an old fogy and still play this upbeat, 
soulful music effectively. We're still as funky as anybody out there." 
</P>
<P>
 Anybody who doubts that boast should check out "Peace Sign," the new War album 
on Avenue Records, which is headed by Jerry Goldstein, who co-managed the group 
in the glory days. It's their strongest attempt since the early '80s -- with 
RCA's "Outlaw," its last major label album -- to recapture the superstar 
status. Back in their heyday, with hits like "Slippin' Into Darkness," "The 
Cisco Kid," "Why Can't We Be Friends?" and "The World Is a Ghetto," this was 
one of the biggest bands in pop music. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the message of peace, love and brotherhood -- hardly unusual for 
those days -- that really distinguished the band. What made War unique was its 
sound -- the prominent harmonica/tenor sax lines winding through a crackling 
fusion of R&B, jazz, rock and Latin music -- one of the most distinctive of 
that era. 
</P>
<P>
 Keyboardist-vocalist Jordan, guitarist-vocalist Scott and Brown -- the only 
remaining original members -- have returned to that old sound on this, War's 
18th album. They'd drifted away from it in the '80s, but in the last few years 
there's been renewed interest in the band, largely thanks to rappers sampling 
their old hits -- a trend that led to the 1992 collection "Rap Declares War." 
</P>
<P>
 "It shows that our music is relevant again," says Scott, a jovial, outgoing 
chatterbox who tends to overshadow the low-key Jordan. "We went through a 
period when it wasn't relevant. Nobody wanted to know about War." 
</P>
<P>
 In the late '70s, War was buried under a wave of disco music and never 
recovered. It kept changing labels -- United Artists to MCA to RCA -- and 
making albums but never could recapture the old magic. Since the early '80s, it 
has been largely a club band. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd play anywhere where they'd book us," Jordan recalls. "It wasn't like 
playing big arenas, but we were making OK money. It wasn't embarrassing, but it 
was a little frustrating at times. We'd been in the big time and had gotten 
used to it. But in a way it was fun playing clubs. The pressure was off in many 
ways, and it was a lot like it was when we started back in the old days." 
</P>
<P>
 War originated in the late '60s in the Los Angeles area and rose to local 
prominence as a backup band for former Rams star Deacon Jones. But its career 
didn't get rolling until the band broke away from Jones and recorded with 
British singer Eric Burdon. The band blossomed when it left Burdon in the early 
'70s. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I look back on those days I recall the guys in the band more than the 
music," says Scott who, like Jordan, grew up in Compton. "That makes me feel 
good because there was nothing like the camaraderie and good times I had with 
those guys." 
</P>
<P>
 It was largely a boisterous session until then, with Scott and Jordan spinning 
tales of the good old days, talking about former members B.B. Dickerson, who 
lives in San Bernardino, and Lee Oskar, who left the band in January. But then 
they slipped into a melancholy mood and started reminiscing about the two 
deceased members -- Charles Miller, who was murdered in a 1979 robbery, and 
Papa Dee Allen, who died of an aneurysm onstage at a Northern California club 
in 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 "The last song we played with Papa Dee was 'Gypsy Man,' " Scott recalls 
wistfully. "We haven't played it since."

BILLY CRYSTAL ACTS, PRODUCES AND DIRECTS, (AND MAY EVEN HOST THE OSCARS AGAIN). 
YOU COULD CALL HIM . . . ; THE NICE 800-LB. GORILLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 While Whoopi Goldberg was performing the duties of host of this year's Academy 
Awards show, the two most interested members of the estimated 1 billion people 
watching on television were in Pacific Palisades and San Francisco, talking to 
each other over the telephone. 
</P>
<P>
 The one in Pacific Palisades was Billy Crystal, the Oscar host the previous 
four years, and the one in San Francisco was Robin Williams, America's first 
choice as Crystal's replacement. 
</P>
<P>
 "Robin and I were rooting for her all the time," says Crystal, recalling the 
evening months later in a hotel room in Manhattan. "All during the show, we 
kept the phone line open. 'How do you think she's doing?' 'She's terrific, that 
really went over, didn't it?' It was like she was our kid sister." 
</P>
<P>
 Disinterested reviewers were less impressed with Goldberg's performance than 
her "Comic Relief" co-hosts, and Crystal thinks the criticism was unfair. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was upset that she got hammered in so many places," he says. "It's a tough 
job to do. She was working on a movie, and she had to write her own stuff. 
People don't appreciate how much is involved in that job." 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal, who began practicing Academy Awards speeches by standing in front of 
a bathroom mirror and talking into a toothbrush when he was 8, says it was the 
months of preparation that caused him to skip this year's show. 
</P>
<P>
 "Nobody could understand it, 'How could you not want to do it?' " Crystal 
says. "How I feel, what I do with my family, are more important. I did not need 
the four months of stress. Once I say, 'Yes,' I have a headache until I say, 
'Good night.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal was also busy on "City Slickers II: The Legend of Curly's Gold," which 
opened Friday, and, frankly, he says, life is too short to be consumed by one 
gig, even if it is for the most watched event on the planet. 
</P>
<P>
 "I sense the clock ticking all the time," he says. "Robin and I were talking 
about this the other day. He's 47, I'm 46. He said, 'I think I'll work until 
I'm 60. That's 13 years, I can do about five movies.' Then he got sad. 'Jesus, 
only five movies!' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although Crystal will talk about the Oscars -- past, present and future (he 
says he probably will host again, maybe even next year) -- he has become a 
multiple-threat entertainer, a writer, director, producer and star with the 
power to do almost anything he wants. This fall, he will begin directing and 
starring in "Forget Paris," a comedy inspired by events in his own 24-year 
marriage, and, after that, he says he may fulfill an old dream of doing a 
one-man-show on Broadway. 
</P>
<P>
 In the meantime, he's trying to drum up business for "City Slickers II," which 
returns Crystal, Daniel Stern and Jack Palance to the West they won in the 
original 1991 comedy hit about three New Yorkers whose dude ranch vacation 
turns into a true Western adventure. In the sequel, they hit the trail to 
follow a treasure map found in a dead man's hat. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we wanted to go back into sort of familiar territory," Crystal says 
of his and co-writers Lowell Ganz and Babaloo Mandel's decision to revisit the 
West. "Even though this movie is very different, there is a familiarity that I 
think is just right, just the right amount of winking at the first movie that 
helps this movie." 
</P>
<P>
 To some, "City Slickers II" may be familiar enough to seem like the same 
movie. Palance, whose rawboned cowboy Curly died in the first picture, does an 
encore as Curly's long-lost and equally weird twin, Duke, who is also after 
Curly's gold. 
</P>
<P>
 Palance won the best supporting actor Oscar for his first performance in "City 
Slickers" and used his acceptance speech to show off his physical prowess and, 
inadvertently, to set Crystal up for his best performance as the Academy Awards 
host. 
</P>
<P>
 It was during the first half-hour of the '92 Oscar telecast that Palance, then 
73, dropped to the floor and began a series of one-armed pushups that we 
thought would never end. In the wings, Crystal looked on with as much amazement 
as everyone else. 
</P>
<P>
 "At first, I'm thinking, 'What is he doing? This is too weird,' " Crystal 
recalls. "Then I went out and made a couple of jokes about it, got huge laughs, 
and knew I could run with this thing the whole night." 
</P>
<P>
 And he did, returning between commercials with updates on Palance's continuing 
adventures. He's backstage on a Stairmaster, he's going to enter the Ironman 
competition, he just bungee-jumped off the Hollywood sign. Later, Crystal 
brought the house down when he walked onto the stage after a huge "Hook" 
production number and quipped, "Jack Palance is the father of all those kids." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal, who once aspired to be a professional baseball player, talks about 
that '92 show as Ted Williams might talk about his .408 batting season. But it 
was the circumstances under which he worked that set that performance off. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was a weird night, and maybe the greatest night of my career as a 
comedian," he says. "I had pneumonia. . . . I had a temperature of 103; I 
couldn't hear anything. I rehearsed my medley (that morning), but that was it. 
I went home and took some vaporizer treatments and shots and went to bed. 
Earlier, we called Tom Hanks and asked if he would pinch-hit for me." 
</P>
<P>
 But Crystal made it to the show, got through his opening monologue, then saw 
Palance hand him "the greatest setup in the history of Oscar comedy," and he 
fell into a groove that only comedians, musicians and athletes can fully 
appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't the Palance jokes that Crystal recalls with the greatest pride, 
however. It was the line he came up with when "Our Gang" comedies creator Hal 
Roach, whose 100th birthday Crystal paused to acknowledge, stood in the 
audience and began an impromptu speech that no one more than a few feet from 
him could hear. 
</P>
<P>
 Suddenly, 3,000 people in the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion and a billion or so 
more watching on TV were joined in a silent void, and Crystal says his mind was 
racing through "a million jokes" trying to rescue the moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "That is only fitting," he said, as Roach finished, "because Mr. Roach started 
his career in silent movies." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back on it, the line seems less a joke than an inspired observation, 
but it got Roach, the audience, the network and the show off the hook and gave 
live TV one of its finer examples of grace under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 "For that one moment, I can always say I was a really good comedian," Crystal 
says. "In baseball terms, I got all of that one. I could quit now and say, 
'That was a good thing.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal says he regretted not quitting the Oscar show after the '92 telecast. 
"Just ride in like 'Shane,' solve the problem, and ride out." Chances of 
another Palance setup were slim and, without it, he says, it's just an awards 
show. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, critics found him flat and off the next year, and although the 
job seems to be his in perpetuity if he wants it, he decided not to return in 
1994. He admits he wasn't sure until the show was under way with Goldberg that 
he'd done the right thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Crystal says he would have opened the show by pulling Frank Sinatra out of the 
wings and letting him finish his Grammy speech, and he would have countered the 
soberness of all those "Schindler's List" speeches by poking a little fun at 
the movie. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I know is that the first woman who won, the set designer, was named Ewa 
Braun," he says, pronouncing it the same as Hitler's mistress. "They pronounced 
it 'E-wah,' but it's really 'E-vah,' and the guy who came up with her had a 
little mustache and his hair was sort of down. . . . I would have been all over 
that."

CBS' NEW GAME PLAN FOR SUNDAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RICK DU BROW, TIMES TELEVISION WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was never written in stone that pro football was predestined to dominate 
network TV on Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, it wasn't always this way. 
</P>
<P>
 Some people actually don't give a hoot about watching the NFL, especially when 
a game becomes a blowout or is meaningless -- both of which happen often. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Sunday pro football is a national television institution to many, and 
it's pretty well tuned-in to boot. 
</P>
<P>
 Thus, it becomes fascinating to see how CBS, which was left holding the bag 
when Fox grabbed the games from the older network -- effective this fall -- 
intends to fill the gap. 
</P>
<P>
 At first glance -- and maybe in total fact -- the CBS plans look desperate, 
perhaps especially to those raised in a generation that doesn't remember when 
things were different on TV's Sunday afternoons. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 And make no mistake about it: CBS was hurt badly by the loss, would give just 
about anything to have the games back and will probably go to the mat to find 
another killer sports substitute for Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 There's even been talk about CBS backing and building up a new football 
league, which is how NBC got into the gridiron top tier, thanks in part to such 
earlier stars as Joe Namath. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS' immediate plans are probably OK for a start, a first draft. Things, 
however, will be tough because, unlike the '50s and '60s when networks were the 
whole ballgame, there now are also 24-hour cable competitors ranging from 
American Movie Classics to MTV to CNN. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, CBS has to start somewhere. And its first plans for alternative shows 
to compete with pro football -- significant decisions because the programs lead 
into prime time -- are to present "Hallmark Entertainment" productions and 
"Harlequin Sunday Matinee Romance" movies, along with the "CBS Sports Figure 
Skating Challenge" and other sports, including tennis and golf. 
</P>
<P>
 CBS clearly hopes the tremendous audience interest in the recent Winter 
Olympics, hyped by the Tonya Harding-Nancy Kerrigan rivalry, has created a new, 
winning sports attraction in figure skating. 
</P>
<P>
 Overall, however, the planned CBS lineup is not likely to strike fear in the 
hearts of Fox executives or to halt other stations from defecting from the Big 
Three networks to make sure they can carry NFL games. 
</P>
<P>
 But, among other things, there'll be a particular interest in how the CBS 
alternatives do in West Coast markets such as Los Angeles, where -- because of 
the three-hour coast-to-coast time difference -- pro football is usually well 
over before prime time starts and its lead-in importance is therefore 
minimized. 
</P>
<P>
 There will also be interest in just how much we -- the audience -- have 
changed in the last generation. Are we so hooked on TV sports that we're no 
longer open to the kind of programming that once thrived -- or at least 
survived and tried -- on Sundays? 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, much of it was just ordinary or less, but some was spectacularly ambitious 
or at least relatively popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Competitively, Sunday afternoons -- leading up to the 7 p.m. prime-time start 
-- was never ratings heaven in the earlier years for the networks, which now 
are consumed with statistical performances that assure their existence and are 
reluctant to experiment, as once was the custom. 
</P>
<P>
 But Sunday afternoon did mean something else before football blew just about 
everything else away for nearly half a year and thus diminished its importance 
as a network programming daypart in the other months as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Old-time Sunday afternoon and early evening programming -- before 7 p.m. -- 
had a strong family thrust as well as venturing into news, the arts and plain 
old entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 Did you know, for instance, that programs such as "Mr. Ed" and "Maverick" 
began just before prime time for a while? Do you remember that "60 Minutes" 
aired for a time in its earlier years from 6 to 7 p.m.? 
</P>
<P>
 A memorable series that began at 6:30 was NBC's "Profiles in Courage," a 
one-hour dramatic anthology based on President John F. Kennedy's book. Yet 
another 6:30 show was ABC's "Walt Disney Presents." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from long-running news programs such as "Meet the Press," probably the 
most famous Sunday afternoon series was the legendary "Omnibus," a collection 
of drama, music, documentaries and the arts in general, hosted by Alistair 
Cooke. 
</P>
<P>
 There were other Sunday afternoon entries that certainly had a definite 
presence, from the engaging quiz show "College Bowl" to Leonard Bernstein's 
"Young People's Concerts" (it appeared elsewhere as well) to "Wild Kingdom," 
"See It Now," "You Are There," "The Twentieth Century" and "NBC Experiment in 
Television," a sometimes wondrous hour that offered one of the first serious 
dramas about the Watts area of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 New CBS Entertainment President Peter Tortorici, who, you can bet, would 
rather have the NFL games, now says hopefully: "A new and competitive daypart 
has been born on Sunday afternoons. There is a huge, underserved audience out 
there, including women and families." 
</P>
<P>
 If the unending popularity of daytime soap operas rubs off, the "Harlequin" 
romance movies might have a shot. NBC has also made ratings hay by 
counter-programming sports events with Danielle Steel's mushy, glitzy romance 
dramas. 
</P>
<P>
 And, for years, the networks have also counter-programmed ABC's Monday night 
pro football games, in part, with female-oriented movies and comedies for 
people who don't know the Raiders from the Redskins. 
</P>
<P>
 Will there be an audience for "Hallmark Entertainment"? Depends on the shows, 
of course. But back in TV's early years, Hallmark -- best known for its "Hall 
of Fame" specials -- had a Sunday afternoon slot. 
</P>
<P>
 And in that same category, one of the historic broadcasts of early TV was 
NBC's 1953 version of "Hamlet" with Maurice Evans, which was presented on a 
Sunday afternoon and helped break ground on the new medium for longer-form 
dramas. 
</P>
<P>
 The lineup of yesteryear's Sunday afternoon and early evening shows that 
preceded prime time will strike many a chord in those who grew up with TV. 
There were "Victory at Sea," "Wide Wide World," "My Friend Flicka," the 
"Original Amateur Hour," "NBC Opera Theater," "Hopalong Cassidy," "The Lone 
Ranger," "Mr. I. Magination," "Juvenile Jury," "Sky King," "The Roy Rogers 
Show," Ed Murrow's "Small World" and Walter Winchell's series as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Remember "Super Circus"? "Capt. Gallant of the Foreign Legion"? "Tales of the 
Texas Rangers"? The ambitious failure "The Seven Lively Arts"? The sitcom 
"McKeever and the Colonel"? And, for a while on Sunday afternoons, the 
"Bullwinkle" show and "The Jetsons"? 
</P>
<P>
 Are we ready to even give a chance to any entertainment CBS throws our way on 
Sunday afternoons? Or are we just more interested now in watching somebody -- 
anybody -- throw a pass?

THEATER REVIEW; HUMOR'S USUALLY AT BENFIELD'S 'BEDSIDE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.H. McCULLOH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If there's one thing that's as difficult to re-create as French farce, it's 
British farce. While the melodies may differ, the rhythms are the same. And it 
is just those rhythms, which are written in, that cause some of the problems in 
the Fullerton Civic Light Opera's otherwise solid production of Derek 
Benfield's "Bedside Manners." 
</P>
<P>
 There are the requisite seven doors of farce for the characters to race in and 
out of and a deliciously simple plot. Of course, there are enormous 
complications and confusions for two "Mr. Smiths" who have come to a secluded 
British inn with their girlfriends only to discover gradually that each 
girlfriend is actually the wife of. . . . Even the pushy, slightly dim hotel 
porter finally figures it all out, the mates are reunited and infidelity is 
once more averted. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the action, under Glenn Bradley's direction, flows easily, but too 
often the timing of the farce is braked by the addition of physical comedy that 
obviously is new with this production. 
</P>
<P>
 You can almost hear the playwright's metronome stop ticking while Joe 
Fletcher, as the porter, spins about in confusion, or crawls along the floor 
and up the stairs in exaggerated exhaustion. Farce happens to real people, and 
a real person would not do these things. As Bert Lahr said about farce: "The 
moment you start to clown, the fun is gone. That isn't the rhythm of farce." 
</P>
<P>
 Leslie Tinnaro, as Helen, also has a tendency to depend too much on physical 
shtick that doesn't fit between Benfield's beats. Her costumes, by Ambra 
Wakefield, consisting of a baggy sweater and shapeless dresses, are not the 
garb of a woman wed to Roger and lusted after by Geoff. But she is a good bit 
closer to form than Fletcher. 
</P>
<P>
 Tinnaro, along with John Boyle as her husband, Roger, Debbie Grattan as Sally, 
and Matt Miller as Sally's husband, Geoff, otherwise have a very nice feel for 
the material and for the style. Their frantic action, which builds as the play 
progresses, is mostly on Benfield's wavelength. 
</P>
<P>
 Bradley's guidance plays into the humor, and one wonders why he allows the 
interruptions. It is also a mystery why, in an outdoor amphitheater that is 
small enough and acoustically sound enough to avoid it, the actors are 
amplified. 
</P>
<P>
 On the night this reviewer attended, Miller's microphone went out for several 
minutes, and he had no problem being heard. On top of that, the sound is so 
loud that some of the scenes look as though they're being lip-synced to a 
recording. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a sight gag worth noting in Steven Craig's excellent hotel setting: 
identical paintings in both rooms. It's a touch of reality that should have 
been heeded throughout. 
</P>

TALKING PAST, PRESENT AND 'SUTURE' AT UCI; MOVIES: SCOTT MCGEHEE AND DAVID 
SIEGEL SAY LIFE'S GOOD -- NOW. BUT THEY ADMIT TO FILM PROFESSORS AND STUDENTS 
THAT MAKING THEIR ARTSY THRILLER WASN'T EASY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK CHALON SMITH, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Scott McGehee and David Siegel were beaming. And why not? They kept getting 
doused with high praise by the two dozen or so film professors and students who 
showed up Thursday night at UC Irvine to hear about the duo's hot new movie 
career. 
</P>
<P>
 McGehee and Siegel, who grew up in Orange County, happily accepted kudos for 
their artsy thriller, "Suture." The independent picture (which is being 
distributed by the Samuel Goldwyn Co.) has been lauded at prestigious events 
including the Telluride, Sundance and Cannes film festivals, and the small UCI 
audience didn't find any reason to disagree. 
</P>
<P>
 The team that wrote, directed and produced "Suture" had to admit that life is 
pretty good these days. But that didn't keep them from remembering how tough it 
has been. Siegel, 34, recalled his almost debilitating anxiety when shooting 
began several months ago in Phoenix.  
</P>
<P>
 "That first week, I was so frazzled I thought I was on the verge of a nervous 
breakdown," he said during the informal gathering in the Humanities Building 
conference room. "There was so much to do, so much that could go wrong; making 
a movie is like catering 17 parties in one day. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an exhilarating experience, but also overwhelming." 
</P>
<P>
 Then there were the financial troubles. Even though "Suture" was shot in black 
and white on a relatively cheap $1-million budget, production stalled when 
funds ran out. It took five months, much hustling for backers and the help of 
director Steven Soderbergh ("sex, lies and videotape"), who saw the film at one 
of the festivals, to raise the needed cash. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were only two-thirds through and really struggling to finish," Siegel 
said. "You never know if you will. Soderbergh was very committed, and that 
helped us through. After the (positive reaction at the) Telluride and Toronto 
film festivals, Goldwyn picked it up." 
</P>
<P>
 "Suture" -- which has already screened in Los Angeles, New York and elsewhere 
for short runs, gaining generally favorable reviews -- is scheduled to open at 
selected theaters in Orange County on Friday, said Stephanie Kluft, a Goldwyn 
spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
 The movie stars Dennis Haysbert (seen most recently with Michelle Pfeiffer in 
"Love Field") as a man who is disfigured when his half-brother tries to murder 
him. A surgeon played by Mel Harris (a regular on TV's "thirtysomething") 
reconstructs his body while a psychologist (Sab Shimono) works on his mind. 
</P>
<P>
 As the slick press packet puts it: "Clay (Haysbert) suddenly finds himself 
with the face, the fortune and the reputation of a notorious scoundrel who is 
under suspicion of murdering his own father."  
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have not been completely enamored of the movie's artsy overtones. 
Times reviewer Peter Rainer wrote that "McGehee and Siegel have the flair to 
bring something distinctively new to black comedy once they shake out their 
art-film kinks. 'Suture' is the archetypal 'promising' first feature." 
</P>
<P>
 It's just the kind of criticism that annoys McGehee, who attended Laguna Beach 
High School, and Siegel, a Newport Harbor High School graduate. They're proud 
of the movie's highbrow style, saying they want audiences to be challenged as 
well as be entertained. 
</P>
<P>
 Their desire to move beyond the mainstream has actually created tension 
between them and Goldwyn. McGehee, 32, said the studio was looking for easy, 
viewer-friendly packaging when it began promoting "Suture" as a thriller, a 
label they feel is too simplistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "It should be pitched more as a film that makes you think," he explained, 
adding that he nonetheless understood Goldwyn's reasoning because " 'Suture' is 
hard to describe and hard to sell." 
</P>
<P>
 But Siegel was more pointed. He believes Goldwyn "doesn't really like the 
film" and has not done enough to promote it, as a thriller or otherwise.  
</P>
<P>
 In discussing their movie, McGehee and Siegel were frequently asked by the UCI 
audience (many of whom saw the picture last weekend in a one-time screening at 
the Port Theatre in Newport Beach) why they chose Haysbert, who is black, to 
play the role as if he were white.  
</P>
<P>
 The film's central conceit, and one that has generated much comment from 
critics, is that although the audience can see that Haysbert is black, they are 
supposed to accept that everyone in the picture perceives him as white. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel and McGehee insist that they are not making a racial statement and, 
instead, are trying to question how we interpret the environment and our 
identities. Further, McGehee said that the audience should find some amusement 
in being privy to the illusion -- knowing that Haysbert is black while the 
film's other characters do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Siegel and McGehee, who now live in Los Angeles, began making short films 
together in 1989 without any formal training. Neither went to film school, but 
they shared a love of the movies, especially those from Japan. They learned on 
the job. 
</P>
<P>
 "On one of our first films, we rented camera equipment and had to pay the guy 
an extra $50 just to show us how to run it," Siegel recalled. "We'd get our 
friends involved, everyone clicking the clapper (that introduces scenes) for 
fun." 
</P>
<P>
 With a wry smile, McGehee continued: "I'd have to say we were pretty naive 
(both then and during the shooting of 'Suture'). We've definitely learned a lot 
in the past couple of years."

THEATER REVIEW; AMBITIOUS 'HIGHWAY' DEAD-ENDS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By NANCY CHURNIN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On July 20, a quarter-century will have passed since men first walked on the 
moon. "Dixie Highway," a musical in its world premiere at the Hahn Cosmopolitan 
Theatre, tries to capture the wonder of that time, but it never quite does. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 It's especially frustrating because the talent both on and behind the stage is 
so strong that one keeps rooting for this show to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The collaborators for "Dixie" -- director, lyricist and book co-writer Will 
Roberson, composer Steve Gunderson, choreographer Javier Velasco and star 
Melinda Gilb -- are the same team that launched "Suds," a bright, winning spoof 
of '60s music that traveled from San Diego to off-Broadway five years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But in "Dixie Highway," a five-character story about a waitress in a Kentucky 
roadside diner, their high spirits seem constricted by some Need to Say 
Something Important. A resulting overload of melodrama and corn-pone 
sentimentality leaves "Dixie Highway" as flat as blown-out tires on an 
18-wheeler. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, all Roberson and company have come up with is an uninspired riff on 
mother/daughter conflict. Hard-working waitress/war widow Dixie (Gilb) has 
scrimped and saved to send her daughter Sarah (Christine Hewitt) to college. 
But Sarah doesn't want to go to college. She wants to write. A hippie (Rick D. 
Meads) passes through the diner with a flair for music but not for lyrics. 
Guess what happens next? 
</P>
<P>
 Roberson and Tom Oldendick, his co-writer, seem to be suggesting that the 
moonwalk at once symbolized and inspired change. But they don't want to tackle 
the anger that exploded because of all that change. Racial tension was high 
after the murder of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.; Roberson and Oldendick 
merely throw in an African American character, Iris (Tracy Hughes), who gets 
along great with everybody. And even though the Vietnam War was raging, when 
the hippie meets up with a my-country-right-or-wrong electronics salesman, they 
become best buddies. 
</P>
<P>
 When Roberson relaxes and has fun with the show, with "Suds"-like parodies of 
Gladys Knight and the Pips, it's a blast. Gale McNeeley is endearing as Carl, 
the electronics salesman who has proposed marriage to Dixie every Sunday for 
years.  
</P>
<P>
 Gilb, a charismatic performer with a searing voice, is hampered by having to 
wear a sour expression for most of the show. Hughes has a rich voice and all 
the right moves, but her part is just not believable. Meads is another gifted 
actor with vocal talent to match, but his part, too, is a thin one. Hewitt 
plays Sarah with charm but can't make the rebellious teen-ager more than a 
caricature. 
</P>
<P>
 Another disappointment: Gunderson's music. It makes for some passionate and/or 
clever moments. But it's supposed to reflect a decade of unforgettable music, 
and it lacks even a single song that stands out. (Gunderson's arrangements, 
however, are impeccable.) 
</P>
<P>
 Velasco's choreography has a natural yet impish delight to it, from the Pips 
spoof to the graceful water kicks by the waitresses soaking their feet as they 
sing "Two Bit Dreams." 
</P>
<P>
 Robin Roberts' set comes with old-time diner prices (45 cents for a BLT) and 
all the proper gums and candies on a shelf under the cash register. Dione 
Lebhar's costumes also evoke the times, from the hippie patches to Carl's 
too-short pants over white socks. Ashley York Kennedy's lighting is 
alternately, and suitably, romantic and nostalgic. 
</P>
<P>
 Ultimately, though, the big problem with "Dixie Highway" (named after a real 
highway in southern Kentucky) is that it just doesn't know where it's going. 
Roberson and Oldendick should either write a real story or just reach for the 
fun.

 Gorbachev Joins Awards Circuit: Former Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev will 
be the keynote speaker at the fourth annual Environmental Media Awards in Los 
Angeles on Oct. 17. Sponsored by the Environmental Media Assn., the awards 
honor films, TV shows and music that promote positive environmental messages. 
Gorbachev will represent Green Cross International, an environmental 
organization he founded last year. The awards will be broadcast on cable's 
Turner Broadcasting System.

 Reaching the Voters: Former Vice President Dan Quayle has been making the TV 
rounds lately to promote his book and revisit his campaign-year "Murphy Brown" 
debate over single motherhood. And if the response received from 150,000 
viewers who called CBS after his appearance Wednesday on "America Tonight" is 
correct, Quayle has drawn many voters to his side. After a Quayle commentary 
saying that welfare mothers have additional children to receive more government 
money, 93% of callers to the program's 900 number agreed with his position. And 
83% said they would vote for Quayle for President.

programs "particularly enjoyable for family viewing." The Family Viewing Logo 
will appear in place of the standard network logo, in the lower right-hand

each commercial break. Last year, the network started a hot line, (800)

Atlanta Falcon football player Andre Rison. Lopes, 22, is accused of setting 
fire to Rison's two-story $861,000 mansion early Thursday after Rison returned 
from an all-night outing. Police said Lopes also slapped and cursed at Rison 
and smashed two Mercedes and a Toyota parked outside the home. No one was 
injured. Last year, Rison was arrested after allegedly hitting Lopes and firing 
a gun. The charges were dismissed.

restaurant in the city's warehouse district. He paid $185,000 for the 
four-story building, but there's no word yet on what the plans are. The pop

NETWORKS STILL FAILING IN KIDS' PROGRAMS, STUDY SAYS; TELEVISION: EDUCATIONAL 
SHOWS ARE RELEGATED TO FRINGE VIEWING HOURS AND SHOESTRING BUDGETS, CENTER FOR 
MEDIA EDUCATION FINDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Network television doesn't make the grade when it comes to meeting a federal 
requirement to air educational programs for children, according to a new study 
presented to Congress on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Educational TV programs such as "Real News for Kids" and "CityKids" are either 
made on shoestring budgets that amount to less than one-tenth the cost of 
prime-time fare, or are relegated to fringe viewing hours not accessible to the 
young viewing audience the programs are supposed to reach, according to the 
study by the Center for Media Education, a Washington-based advocacy 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "We found that most of the programs created in response to the Children's 
Television Act have been assigned a second-class status in commercial 
television," Kathryn C. Montgomery, president of the center, said at a hearing 
Friday before the House subcommittee on telecommunications and finance. 
</P>
<P>
 The criticism of children's television programming resurrects a highly charged 
issue that has vexed the networks for more than two decades. Since the late 
1960s, Action for Children's Television and other groups have urged TV 
executives -- traditionally driven by profits and ratings -- to grant children 
special dispensation. 
</P>
<P>
 As in the past, lawmakers and critics focused their ire on the big commercial 
broadcast networks even though many experts say cable television, which now 
reaches nearly two-thirds of American homes, has a poorer children's 
programming record than its network counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, NBC and Fox television executives who attended Friday's hearing said 
commercial television has made substantial programming improvements since the 
passage of the Children's Television Act. 
</P>
<P>
 "NBC, and the entire broadcasting industry, has come a long way since the act 
was adopted: from a schedule that consisted mainly of cartoons to a 2 1/2-hour 
block of high-quality, live-action programming specifically designed not only 
to entertain but to serve . . . educational and informational needs," said 
Linda Mancuso, vice president for children's and family programs at NBC. 
</P>
<P>
 The Children's Television Act, which became effective Oct. 1, 1991, requires 
broadcasters to air educational children's programming as a condition of 
getting their government-issued broadcast licenses renewed. 
</P>
<P>
 "While some quality shows have been created in direct response to the law . . 
. there is still much work to be done," a National Education Assn. official, 
Rosanne Bacon, told the House panel. 
</P>
<P>
 But one subcommittee member, Rep. W.J. Tauzin (D-La.), argued that viewers are 
a better judge of children's programming than politicians or even educators. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the end, the American public is the best judge of what television network 
is the best," said Tauzin. 
</P>
<P>
 The Center for Media Education, which is spearheading a group of 15 consumer 
and child advocacy organizations seeking to convince Congress and the Federal 
Communications Commission that tougher measures are needed, wants the term 
educational programming more precisely defined and believes such programs 
should be regularly scheduled between 7 a.m. and 10 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is because powerful marketplace forces work against children that we need 
effective public policies to counter them," said Montgomery. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission is scheduled to review its children's TV 
regulations later this month.

 Although "Doonesbury" creator Garry Trudeau refers to the Catholic church as 
blessing same-sex unions, most, but not all, of the claims of such unions point 
to rituals and practices of Catholics who later came to be identified with the 
Eastern Orthodox Church. Church spokesmen dispute the claims made in a book by 
Yale University professor John Boswell.

 Some of the country's top competitive ballroom dancers -- including a few from 
Orange County -- will whirl, dip and shimmy here Sunday to raise money for 
Western Medical Center-Bartlett, a nonprofit long-term rehabilitation facility 
in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 The second annual Ballroom Dance Extravaganza will be from 4 to 9 p.m. at the 
Newport Beach Marriott Hotel and Tennis Club, 900 Newport Center Drive.It

COMEDY REVEIW; FOREMEN BETTER THAN CLEVER AT USING WORDPLAY TO POKE FUN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LAWRENCE CHRISTON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Did anyone ever really sing "Kumbaya" and mean it? Or, for that matter, 
"Michael, Row the Boat Ashore"? 
</P>
<P>
 The Foremen are on hand to tell us that yes, we did, and they know we'd like 
to kill them for reminding us. We wore Nehru jackets and bell bottoms too, and 
murmured the righteous mantras of peace and love as we got high with a little 
help from our friends. Hide this stuff from the kids. How could we ever have 
been so dumb? 
</P>
<P>
 Blame it on folk music, that dewy-eyed, troubadour-pluckin', flower child 
strummin' canon of earnestness that started, lead singer Kenny Rhodes tells us, 
with the beginning of time and ended in 1974. And it keeps threatening to come 
back, despite the concerted efforts of scientists to head it off as the 
repository of all our ills. Our naive sentimentality, our retro idealism. 
Whales? Forget 'em. Women need perfume. Men need to kill. Did you know whale 
blubber tastes like chicken? Ever drink milk and honey? It tastes like . . . 
chicken. 
</P>
<P>
 Long before Doug Whitney comes up with that line late in the show at LunaPark, 
you begin to settle into the rare comfort of realizing that the Foremen are 
better than clever. They've taken a form that sounds like something leaking out 
of a time capsule -- evocations of Vaughn Monroe, the Limeliters, the Kingston 
Trio, with Beach Boy and reggae licks thrown in -- and retooled it into the 
only survival mode it could possibly have in the 
you-get-yours-and-I'll-get-mine '90s; that is, as satire. 
</P>
<P>
 Lyricist Roy Zimmerman plays guitar and banjo, the deadpan earnest Andy Corwin 
plays bass, Whitney plays guitar and Rhodes plays drum, toy saxophone and boat 
whistle, among other things. They have a young Republican '50s look -- dark 
suits, glasses, skinny ties -- and they're excellent musicians (satire without 
dexterity is mere derision). 
</P>
<P>
 The sensitized '90s man, Ollie North, Bill Clinton, Dan Rostenkowski and 
hard-charging MBAs are among their many targets skewered with considerable 
wordplay. After a while, you realize their ridicule of the folk genre is 
offered as an irony -- we can't really be healthy if we can't laugh at the way 
we were. And they suggest that if we weren't really good at loving then, we're 
very good at hating now. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Foremen perform Sunday at 5 p.m., Thursday at 7:30 p.m., Friday at 8 
p.m., and June 19 at 5 p.m. 665 N. Robertson, West Hollywood, (310) 652-0611.

JAZZ NOTES: NASCIMENTO, SCOTT-HERON SHARE THE SAME CONCERNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN STEWART, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Though on the surface singer-songwriters Milton Nascimento and Gil Scott-Heron 
hardly seem alike -- one hails from Rio de Janeiro, the other from Chicago -- 
they are essentially brothers of word and song. 
</P>
<P>
 The two artists, who both appear in Southern California tonight, have long 
embraced similar issues in their work -- personal dignity, political freedom, 
world peace and respect for the environment (mostly Nascimento, in regards to 
the Brazilian rain forest), as well as the long-standard fare of songs: affairs 
of the heart. 
</P>
<P>
 The often enthralling Nascimento, who plays tonight at 8 at the Wiltern, 
recently released "Angelus," his debut album for Warner Bros. The album, which 
features such guest artists as Herbie Hancock, Wayne Shorter, James Taylor and 
Peter Gabriel, finds Nascimento applying his compelling, rhythmic singing style 
to his favorite themes, with often involved, penetrating words. 
</P>
<P>
 Nascimento started performing in the mid-'60s in Brazil but didn't really 
reach American audiences until his appearance on Shorter's classic 1975 
release, "Native Dancer." The artist, who has recorded more than 20 albums, 
will bring a Brazilian band to the Wiltern. Tickets: (213) 480-3232; 
information: (213) 380-5005. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott-Heron, who performs tonight at Birdland West in Long Beach, is renowned 
for such '70s era selections as "The Revolution Will Not Be Televised" (about 
the political and social awakening of the African American community), 
"Johannesburg" (about apartheid) and "Home Is Where the Hatred Is," a tale of a 
heroin addict -- the latter number was recorded poignantly by the late Esther 
Phillips. 
</P>
<P>
 "Spirits," Scott-Heron's latest album on TVT Records, continues to delve into 
his chosen topics and features his unique, rich-voiced monologues and singing 
over a variety of jazz, R&B and pop musical backgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 Scott-Heron will perform at 9 and 10:30 p.m., appearing with the band that 
recorded "Spirits," including Kim Jordan, piano, Leon Williams, saxes, and Ed 
Brady, guitar. Information: (310) 436-9341.

POP MUSIC REVIEW; SAM PHILLIPS WORKS HER WILL AT THE ROXY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS WILLMAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Since reinventing herself from gospel singer to heady mainstream thrush in the 
late '80s, Sam Phillips has developed one of the oddest performing personas in 
pop -- basically, the rock singer as stationary object. She would literally 
stare down the audience from a fixed spot, offering a sort of sober, sultry, 
confrontational cabaret in place of pop's mandatory exuberance. 
</P>
<P>
 Her striking minimalism was much the same Thursday at the Roxy, where she 
performed her first local headlining gig in many years. For the first time, 
though, she had a keyboard-free band behind her, ready, willing and able to 
play rock 'n' roll -- as suggested by the slightly harder tone of her current 
"Martinis and Bikinis" -- instead of going for the baroque. 
</P>
<P>
 The counterpoint incorporated both in-your-face class and go-cat-go punch, 
with Phillips seeming less off-puttingly theatrical and more natural backed by 
the Holly-to-Harrison guitars of T Bone Burnett and X's Tony Gilkyson, the 
richly melodic bass of vet Jerry Scheff and the deal-clinching drums of young, 
agreeably overenthusiastic Josh LaBelle. 
</P>
<P>
 Phillips ironically uses her physical conservatism to sing about abandon. She 
dedicated "Circle of Fire" to Rush Limbaugh and Jerry Falwell, "who I think 
just announced their engagement," and the too-short set focused on her 
virulently pro-"love"/anti-"moralism" protest songs, which are at once bitterly 
anti-religion yet sexily religious. Her personal and political metaphor-mixing 
is some of pop's most provocative writing right now, and she's found a live 
context to do her theoretics justice. CHRIS WILLMAN

TV REVIEW; RE-EXAMINING THE TANTALIZING 'EARHART' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RAY LOYND, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Amelia Earhart . . . just the sound of her name evokes clouds and wings, 
impenetrable mystery and heroism. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What is it about this aviator that continues to grab our imaginations? 
</P>
<P>
 "Amelia Earhart -- The Final Flight" dramatizes a lot of the answers. A TNT 
cable movie that itself takes flight, it features captivating performances by 
Diane Keaton as the single-minded flier and Bruce Dern as her cajoling, 
Svengali husband (publisher G. P. Putnam) who promoted and lionized the 
reclusive Earhart into a media superstar and one of our first modern American 
heroines. 
</P>
<P>
 She wasn't nicknamed "Lady Lindy" for nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 Centered on the last two years of Earhart's life, the artful script (by Anna 
Zandor) flaps together the public and private lives of Earhart, underscoring 
her unconventional marriage, her temper and her foolish, reckless indifference 
to mastering navigation or the use of her cockpit radio. She drives her pilot 
teacher, the famous stunt pilot Paul Mantz (Paul Guilfoyle), a little crazy. 
</P>
<P>
 Keaton, with her shagged hair and '30s fashions cut just so, creates a complex 
heroine who is far from an angelic figure.  
</P>
<P>
 But the movie's achievement, including a spectacular opening flashback that 
sets up the whole movie and looks like something Ingmar Bergman would have 
helmed, runs far deeper. Directed by Yves Simoneau, its triumph is to show why 
-- more than half a century after she and her navigator, Fred Noonan, slipped 
from radio contact in their silver Lockheed Electra somewhere over the South 
Pacific -- we still thrill to the story of Earhart's ill-fated round-the-world 
Equator flight during what was still the dawn of aviation in 1937. 
</P>
<P>
 The production, using as source material the Smithsonian-published biography 
"Amelia Earhart" by Doris L. Rich, takes the position that Earhart wasn't the 
hottest female pilot around. We see that she didn't know enough about the use 
of her plane's radio to save them when they were approaching Howland Island, 
which, in this scenario, they never find. As for the old rumors about Earhart 
crashing and surviving as a prisoner of the Japanese, forget it. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Amelia Earhart -- The Final Flight" airs at 5, 7 and 9 p.m. Sunday on TNT 
and repeats June 19, 20, 24 and 26.

A VACANT LAGUNA LOT INTO A BLOOMING FLOWER GARDEN

 Dead-end streets usually terminate in weed patches. And Agate Streetin Laguna 
Beach, which comes to a halt at the head of a steep canyon, once did, too. But 
that was before two passionate gardeners, Gerard Hall and Debra Raeber, moved 
into the neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Short on gardening space on their own properties, each looked on the 
weed-choked parcel between them as opportunity. Starting with the land nearest 
their residences and individually working toward the center, Hall and Raeber 
began supplanting the dandelions and cheese mallow covering the sharp slope 
with wildflowers, spring bulbs, native shrubs and tough perennials. The result 
of their joint efforts five years later is a hillside garden alive with color 
that is an asset to the community. 
</P>
<P>
 Hall began the garden nearly five years ago, shortly after moving into the 
area. The canyon was anything but an asset then, he recalls. 
</P>
<P>
 "People used to park their cars in the canyon or use it as a turnaround, and 
dirt bikers played in it. And both groups kicked up a lot of dust. 
</P>
<P>
 "That was one of the reasons I started the garden. I wanted to stop that." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall began by putting in a narrow border of garden geraniums outside his 
fence, placing one of his large abstract sculptures in the middle of the 
existing traffic pattern and sowing wildflower seeds around the sculpture. 
</P>
<P>
 Another neighbor farther up the hill, Deborah Sullivan, was his inspiration, 
Hall says. "Deborah has sown wildflowers in the canyon outside her property, 
and I thought it looked pretty," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 For more year-round interest, however, he soon added penstemon, scabiosa, 
gaillardia, coreopsis, and other easy-care perennials. Cleveland sage, lion's 
tale, and Tagetes lemmonii came a few years later after Debra Raeber moved in 
next door and taught Hall to love rowdier plants. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gerard's garden was one of the reasons I was so excited about moving here," 
says Raeber. "He was out working in the garden when my husband and I first 
looked at our house, and Gerard and I started talking about plants immediately 
and became instant friends." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raeber knew she would join in Hall's efforts to beautify the canyon even 
before moving into the neighborhood, she says, but she wanted to take a 
different approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Influenced by her six years as docent at the Hortense Miller Garden in Laguna 
Beach, Raeber had developed a fondness for California native plants. She saw 
the sprawling canyon slope as the perfect laboratory for experimenting with 
Matilija poppy, Cleveland sage, Carpenteria and other natives too vigorous in 
habit for her residential garden. 
</P>
<P>
 Other large rdrought-tolerant shrubs like pineapple sage, Russian Sage, and 
Jerusalem sage went in, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The neighbors' approaches are complimentary. Raeber's shrubs add backbone to 
Hall's more flower-intensive efforts, enhancing them like foliage in a bouquet. 
</P>
<P>
 Just how compatible the neighbors' gardening styles are was evident in late 
May when the central triangle of the garden, planted by Hall, sported both the 
cool spring colors of foxglove, penstemon, and larkspur and the first of the 
hotter summer colors of nasturtiums, coreopsis and gaillardia. 
</P>
<P>
 Raeber's wedge of the garden was quieter -- her spring bulbs having mostly 
disappeared -- but the green and gray foliage of her shrubs provided an 
attractive backdrop to Hall's riot of flowers. And the summer color soon to 
come in her section was beginning to show. The first dinner-plate-sized blooms 
of the Matilija poppy had already opened, and lion's tale and Tagetes lemmonii 
were budding up for imminent display. 
</P>
<P>
 The cantaloupe-colored flowers of an angel-trumpet tree -- replacing Hall's 
original sculpture as a traffic deterrent -- served as a dramatic focal point 
for the dazzling array. 
</P>
<P>
 One reason the neighbors' efforts mesh so well, believes Raeber, is that both 
are plant collectors above all else. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am not committed to a strict color scheme or design," she says. "I just 
like plants. I put them in, and if they're happy, so am I." 
</P>
<P>
 Hall's attitude is equally laissez-faire. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sculpture is a pretty disciplined art form," he says. "And when I do 
landscape maintenance and design work for clients I have restrictions I have to 
follow as well. So this garden is my chance to bust loose." 
</P>
<P>
 Therefore if some of Raeber's bulbs naturalize on Hall's side of the garden, 
or Hall's perennials reseed on Raeber's, or if Sullivan's wildflowers drift 
down the canyon into either half of the garden, neither considers them 
intruders. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are always plenty of surprises in this garden," says Raeber. "Gerard 
and I are always asking each other, 'Did you plant that or did I? " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 While succeeding in deterring automobile and dirt-bike drivers, the garden has 
attracted another form of traffic. Hummingbirds, lured by all the 
tubular-shaped flowers, arrive in squadrons. Other bird life has increased, 
too, says Raeber. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen orioles and Wilson's warblers this year, which, as far as I know, 
is a first here," she says. "We're providing cover with the shrubs and food 
from the flower seeds."  
</P>
<P>
 The other bonus: Monarch butterflies.  
</P>
<P>
 Monarchs have wintered in a grove of eucalyptus in the canyon since the '20s, 
Hall says. 
</P>
<P>
 But their number had dwindled to a handful in recent years, he says, because 
there was very little milkweed left in the area. Milkweed (Asclepias) is the 
host plant upon which monarchs lay their eggs and the emerging caterpillars 
feed. 
</P>
<P>
 Two years ago, however, Raeber obtained seeds from a South Africa milkweed 
from the UCI Arboretum and sowed them in the garden. The African Asclepias -- a 
much bigger plant than our native variety -- had grown into a small grove of 
sapling-sized plants by last year. And they must have looked like Eden to the 
first few Monarch scouts flying into the canyon in December on a scouting 
mission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Because about three weeks later there were monarchs all over the place," she 
says, "and I counted hundreds of caterpillars on the milkweed plants after 
that. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gerard and I were both thrilled and plan to seed more Asclepias further up 
the hill to increase the size of the grove this year." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Though the city of Laguna Beach could exercise its right-of-way option and 
continue Agate as a through street at any time, bulldozing Asclepias Avenue and 
the rest of the garden in the process, neither Raeber nor Hall spend time 
worrying about that prospect. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the canyon is too steep for that to happen," Hall says. "But, if it 
does, well, at least we'll have had the pleasure of the plants in the 
meantime." 
</P>
<P>
 The process of converting the weed patch at the end of Agate Street into a 
showplace garden has not only changed the quality of life in the neighborhood, 
but it also has permanently changed the way its creators view vacant lots. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can't walk around now without noticing all these little pockets of land 
between properties just sitting there idle and imagining gardens in their 
place," says Raeber. "I can't help thinking, 'Why doesn't someone plant 
something there?' "

DECORATING; RUSTY AND RUSTIC; TIN -- MALLEABLE AND LIGHTWEIGHT -- IS IDEAL FOR 
CREATIVE ACCENTS IN MANY DECORS

<P>
 When people think of tin, they usually think of tin cans, tin buckets or, if 
they remember "The Wizard of Oz," the Tin Man. 
</P>
<P>
 They don't think of tin, that humblest of metals, as a trendy material for 
home interiors. Yet when it comes to home decorating, tin is increasingly 
popular. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior designers and artisans are finding the lightweight, malleable and 
inexpensive metal to be an ideal medium for many kinds of accent pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 Tin is being used for lampshades, candlesticks, light switch plates, mirror 
frames, wall sconces, sculptures and other accessories. 
</P>
<P>
 Many home decorators don't recognize that the charmingly weathered and rustic 
frames or lampshades they're seeing in interior design stores are actually made 
from new sheets of tin. That's because, rather than fight tin's natural 
tendency to age less than gracefully, artisans are treating tin so that it 
already looks old. 
</P>
<P>
 Shiny, galvanized tin is still used for watering cans, service plates and 
other items for country interiors, but most tin accessories are treated with 
paints, acids and other chemicals to give them an antique look. 
</P>
<P>
 Rustic and rusty metal accents with a rough, hand-hewn texture can add a 
personal touch to Mediterranean, Southwest, Western and even contemporary 
decors. 
</P>
<P>
 "In the past antiques were used for individuality and character. Now these 
(tin pieces) are taking their place as unique things for the home," says 
Colleen Wolf, an interior designer and manager of Santa Fe Savvy in Laguna 
Niguel. "(Artisans) are making high-end things out of these low-end materials." 
</P>
<P>
 Other metals such as copper, iron and steel are also being used in new ways. 
Pieces such as iron floor lamps with tin shades, iron and glass coffee tables 
and rusty iron bed frames are all part of what Wolf calls the "rustic elegance" 
look. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer Joseph Franklin of Chula Vista makes lamps, lampshades, mirrors and 
other accessories out of copper and tin that he ages artificially. 
</P>
<P>
 "I studied ancient crafts and discovered the old tools and techniques were the 
best way to get the best looks," Franklin says. "I've always been enchanted 
with artifacts and archeology." 
</P>
<P>
 Franklin developed a primitive process to get aged finishes that he calls his 
"Earth Burial" technique. 
</P>
<P>
 "The metal sheet is buried under the earth . . . then we turn it into things," 
he says. 
</P>
<P>
 His tools are primitive. He uses a club with a lot of sharp spikes sticking 
out to make the "wormholes" seen on many of his lamp shades. 
</P>
<P>
 Among his copper creations: a pyramid-shaped floor lamp with a shade covered 
in his tiny wormholes so light shines through ($856), a lampshade with a verde 
(green) finish ($150) or a verde Chimayo mirror ($736), all at Santa Fe Savvy. 
</P>
<P>
 Most tin pieces sold in the area are handmade by artisans in Mexico and New 
Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Mexico, tin has always been popular," says Judy Rasmussen, interior 
designer and co-owner of Aztec Express in Costa Mesa. "Tin artifacts have 
always been used for religious articles in Mexico because they were shiny and 
inexpensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Mexican artisans today often take the shine off tin. They paint it to look 
like more expensive metals, including pewter and copper, to give it a richer 
finish for decorating. They can also give tin the same greenish verdigris 
coating that forms on brass, copper and bronze. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tin has changed its face," Rasmussen says. "It's oxidized, it's molded into 
shapes, it's painted. It's a great medium to work in because it's soft." 
</P>
<P>
 Using hand tools, the artisans pierce or pound out simple designs. Cacti, 
flowers, fish and mountain ranges are popular themes. The hand-crafted items 
appeal to homeowners searching for one-of-a-kind things. 
</P>
<P>
 Items at Aztec Express include a tin vase with verde finish ($40), a 
hand-pierced tin lampshade with a pewter finish by Franklin ($179), a 
5-foot-tall bird cage ($750) and massive mirrors with tin frames, one embossed 
with a toucan motif ($1,495) and a round frame encircled with fish ($895). 
</P>
<P>
 While tin pieces can mix with a wide variety of decors, Wolf says there are 
some interiors where the metal looks out of its element. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tin accessories are inappropriate in really elegant formal rooms," she says. 
"You can't stick in a tin lampshade when the room calls for silk."

INTERIORS; FANS PROVIDE A COOL WAY OF KEEPING HEAT AWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An electric fan can keep you cool despite summer's heat. A fan increases 
airflow in a room, helping to evaporate your body's perspiration. 
</P>
<P>
 There are two basic types: 
</P>
<P>
 * A circulating fan: ceiling, fixed or oscillating, or floor-level hassock 
type, moves the air around within a room. 
</P>
<P>
 * A ventilating fan: most effective for overall home cooling, changes the air 
in the room by blowing out and drawing in fresh air. 
</P>
<P>
 When used with an air conditioner, a ceiling fan can make less cooling feel 
like more. In summer, counterclockwise blade rotation circulates cooling 
breezes. Operated in reverse in winter, a ceiling fan can reclaim heat by 
returning the rising warm air to floor level. Locate a ceiling fan so that its 
blades are at least one foot below the ceiling, seven feet above the floor and 
two feet from the nearest wall. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventilating fans can be portable, fixed in place in a window or installed in 
an attic. Position a box fan or a fixed window fan to blow out hot air. For 
cross-ventilation, open windows only in rooms you wish to cool. 
</P>
<P>
 Usually centrally located in the attic, a whole-house fan pulls hot indoor air 
into the attic and exhausts it through vents. Cool night air is drawn in 
through selectively opened doors and windows, and the house is cooled at a 
fraction of the cost of air conditioning. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The most common type of attic fan is installed in the ceiling beneath the 
attic and pulls air directly from the living area into the unused space above. 
The attic air then moves oubtdoors through ventilating louvers, usually 
installed in the gable ends of the house. 
</P>
<P>
 A whole-house fan should change the air in the house every two minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 To get the right size, calculate the volume of all rooms to be cooled: 
multiply height by width by length of each room and add the totals. Divide by 
two to obtain the "design airflow rate" in cubic feet per minute (CFM). 
</P>
<P>
 Check that the attic vents have at least one square foot of free area for 
every 750 CFM of airflow. Add more or larger vents if they do not. 
</P>
<P>
 Always open at least one exterior door or window before operating a 
whole-house fan. 
</P>
<P>
 For best results, open windows and doors of rooms that are in use. 
</P>
<P>
 Most whole-house fans have 12-hour timers and speed-control switches. Some 
have thermostats too.

 Patch a leaking cooler: Melt paraffin wax and allow it to cool slightly. While 
the wax is soft, plug hole inside and out. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clean window screens: Remove screens and lay them on a flat surface. Mix a 
solution of three parts water to one part ammonia in a bucket and scrub with a 
bristle brush. Rinse with a hose and rap screen with your hand to remove excess 
water. Let screens dry in sun. 
</P>
<P>
 * Keep ants away from the house: Inspect the exterior foundation for anthills. 
Pour one to two cups ammonia down the center of the nest. Place whole cloves of 
garlic around the house entrances and inside cabinets to repel the pests. 
</P>
<P>
 * Remove grease from the electric can opener: Run a paper towel through the 
appliance as if you were opening a can. The towel will absorb the grime. 
</P>
<P>
 * Extend your clothesline with several feet of chain and hang wash-and-wear 
garments on hangers hooked through the links. 
</P>
<P>
 * In the garden, thin out vegetable and flower seedlings when they're a few 
inches tall. If you pull weaker growth, the stronger plants will have more room 
to develop; a few rigorous plants will yield a better harvest and more 
blossoms.

<P>
 Jerry Katz of Leucadia became intrigued with clocks during a trip to Italy in 
1987. He set up a workshop in his garage and began tinkering with clock designs 
until he created a colorful, contemporary design he could call his own. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall clock ($180) features a dot, instead of the usual second-hand arm, 
which moves effortlessly about the axis, while the ball pendulum swings 
smoothly from side to side at the base of the face. 
</P>
<P>
 Katz, who still puts together his works in his garage shop, makes his 
timepieces out of acrylics. The colors can be changed to suit individual tastes 
and needs. 
</P>
<P>
 The wall clock, handmade and signed, is available at Laguna Gander, 295 Forest 
Ave., in Laguna Beach, or by calling (619) 942-9757. Tools of the Trade 
</P>
<P>
 Seiko Instruments of Torrance has added an electronic measurement tool to its 
Home Contractor line of products. The ProMeasure measures a room ultrasonically 
and computes the amount of materials needed for such jobs as painting, 
wallpapering and laying tile. 
</P>
<P>
 The instrument is simply pointed from wall to wall or floor to ceiling and, 
within a few seconds, calculates the distance. The ProMeasure computes in U.S. 
and metric measurement systems. 
</P>
<P>
 It has a compact design (about the size of most TV remote controls) and enough 
buttons to satisfy any channel surfer. 
</P>
<P>
 The ProMeasure (about $50) can be found at department and home remodeling 
stores throughout Orange County. Whole Lotta Cookie 
</P>
<P>
 What's got marshmallow cream between two big, soft cookies, is covered in 
chocolate and is best served with RC Cola? 
</P>
<P>
 Moon Pies, of course. The traditional treat of Chattanooga Bakery Inc., which 
has been around for more than 75 years, is regaining popularity. 
</P>
<P>
 And the product line, which includes such essentials as a custom dispenser 
(available in two sizes, 12-pie for size $16.95, 24-pie size for $22.95, plus 
shipping and handling) and coffee mugs, is being expanded by Houston-based Bird 
Brain International. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispensers, made of Southern yellow pine, are designed to hang on a wall 
or sit on a counter or table, keeping the cookies within easy reach. 
</P>

 An easy chair that looks as much like a piece of the Grand Canyon as it does 
something to sit on was among the offerings introduced at last month's 
International Contemporary Furniture Fair. 
</P>
<P>
 Designer David Strauss of Boston describes as "geomorphic" his chairs and 
sofas that suggest a Western mesa.To create these soft sculptures, Strauss, a 
sculptor turned furniture maker, covers a wood frame with a large block of 
foam. Then he cuts into the foam to simulate forms such as rocky landscapes or 
leafy trees. 
</P>
<P>
 "The weapon of choice is an electric carving knife," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he has the shape he wants, he works out the design for the fabric, 
usually Ultrasuede or leather. The fabric cover is stitched together, then 
tucked into place and sewn onto the chair. 
</P>
<P>
 The designer also sculpts table bases of wood in rounded shapes.

FURNISHINGS; ARTISANS PUT THEIR VISIONS INTO PRACTICE

 In an artist's eye, a bale of hay, old newspapers or piles of tarnished 
vintage pennies become the unlikely stuff of dreams -- a bench for the 
horsewoman's dressing room, a durable chair for a child, a coppery etagere for 
the hall. 
</P>
<P>
 But you can't just build it and hope they will come. 
</P>
<P>
 In the real world of furniture design, the challenge is finding someone to 
share the vision and help make it -- or better yet, buy it. And that's where 
the annual International Contemporary Furniture Fair comes in. 
</P>
<P>
 This 6-year-old magnet of the avant-garde takes place each May, filling the 
halls of the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center with inventiveness and often 
beauty -- like delicate waxed tissue-paper lampshades imprinted with leaves and 
imported from England. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated 11,000 visitors inspected the works of 400 exhibitors -- from the 
Charles Eames chairs of design giant Herman Miller and the sophisticated chic 
of Leland International's industrial stack chairs to curiosities made by 
struggling youngsters seeking their first glimmer of recognition. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects and interior decorators go looking for new sources of custom 
design; manufacturers keep an eye out for new designers. Department-store 
window dressers and TV stylists show up to hunt for props. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the reasons for enthusiasm were a chaise of recycled paper bricks by a 
French group, Arrgh, whose works are being launched in this country by the 
Landon Gallery in New York. Bowls, tables and an etagere made of vintage 
pennies attached end-to-end to a steel frame were the pride of Tom Sachs of 
Allied Cultural Prosthetics, who said he pays suppliers 2 1/2 cents for each 
penny. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 New Yorker Gaston Marticorena was chosen new designer of the year. Now 25, he 
has made his own lighting fixtures for three years and designed furniture for 
two, including a see-through chair stuffed with confetti and upholstered in 
clear plastic and a hay bale on metal legs slipcovered in clear vinyl. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought that my things would be too funky for the average interior designer 
or architect," he said afterward, "but I didn't get any negative reaction. 
Everyone understood it. People would . . . start smiling and laughing." 
</P>
<P>
 He's off to Italy in three weeks to look for a manufacturer. "I would like to 
work in this country, but it seems like it's impossible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Cedric Williams, 30, a fashion designer, turned to furniture two years ago, 
forming a company called Gourmade. "I think furniture will be the fashion for 
the 1990s," he explains. 
</P>
<P>
 Williams attracted attention from the start with a black-vinyl chair that was 
clearly a spoof on Chanel. The back was shaped like a large No. 5. This year, 
he showed tiny end tables covered with large, colorful polka dots. 
</P>
<P>
 The excitement of being discovered can be tempered by the risk of losing an 
idea to a competitor. "The good thing is that everybody sees it; the bad thing 
is that everybody sees it," said Michael McDonough, an architect and design 
writer in New York who was careful to have a patent pending on the 
recycled-paper kiddie furniture he exhibited under the name Eco-sTuff! 
</P>
<P>
 McDonough incorporated alphabet letters and other playful shapes into chairs 
and tables made of Homosote. They are designed to be assembled, painted, drawn 
on and otherwise personalized by their small owners. "I like the blank-slate 
thing," he explained.  
</P>
<P>
 Henner Kuckuck's fiery "Red Chair" was designed more for an adult playroom. 
With its skinny, elongated back, tubular arms and pointy leather headrest, it 
looks set for takeoff on some whimsical journey. Kuckuck, 54, a jovial 
German-born sculptor turned furniture designer, works on commissions through 
Nanna Design in Long Island City. 
</P>
<P>
 He won awards for an earlier chair, which could be collapsed like a big black 
bag when not in use, and survives on private clients (no celebrities), he says. 
"It's tough. The more avant-garde your design is, the tougher it is. So I have 
a tough time." 
</P>
<P>
 But before turning to furniture, he was an artist, also not an easy calling.  
</P>
<P>
 Tina and Francesco Gianesini, two industrial designers in New York, both 26, 
were uncertain about their prospects at the fair. Going by the name G Design, 
they set a goal of finding a manufacturer for their first collection of wicker, 
metal and velvet furniture. They succeeded on the second day. A Utah company, 
Directions, has taken on their designs and intends to get them to market by 
October.

DO-IT-YOURSELF; PATCHING CRACKS IN THE PLASTER DOES NOT HAVE TO BE UNSETTLING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KAROL V. MENZIE and RANDY JOHNSON, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 You say you've stopped napping on the sofa because of that ominous-looking 
crack in the ceiling? You can't take down that 20-year-old paint-by-number 
sunset in the dining room because of the gaping hole behind it? You've learned 
to close doors quietly while listening for the sound of parting plaster? 
</P>
<P>
 Repairing plaster walls found in older homes does not need to be intimidating. 
The truth is, fixing plaster is fairly simple, especially if you have some 
experience in finishing drywall. 
</P>
<P>
 The first step is to take a good look at the walls to figure out how much of 
the plaster is loose. Plaster is applied over lath, narrow wooden strips with 
gaps between them. As the wet plaster is applied, some of it oozes through the 
cracks in the boards. When it dries, the oozed bit forms a sort of knob or slub 
that holds the plaster tight to the wood. The slubs are called keys, and over 
the years, because the house may be settling, or because there is always 
vibration from foot traffic, or even from buses running outside, some of the 
keys break off. 
</P>
<P>
 When it loses its keys, plaster is in trouble. There are plaster washers, 
small flat metal rings that can be nailed through the plaster and back into the 
lath, then coated over with a new layer of plaster. But they are most effective 
in small areas. When plaster loses keys over a wide area, it is probably best 
to take it down and replace it with drywall. (You can, if you live in an area 
where there has been a lot of restoration, find good, old-fashioned plasterers, 
but that kind of craftsmanship does not come cheap.) 
</P>
<P>
 Ceilings are often the area worst hit, and if you have a lot of cracked, 
damaged, loose plaster on a ceiling, it is a good candidate for drywall. In 
addition, if you are doing a major rehab, removing the ceilings makes it easier 
to replace plumbing, wiring and heating pipes or ducts. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's assume that most of your repair work will be on the walls. If you just 
have a crack, dig the crack out slightly and bridge it with joint compound and 
drywall tape; finish like a regular drywall joint. 
</P>
<P>
 In larger areas of bad plaster that need repair, draw a rectangle or square on 
the wall that encompasses the bad section. Then use a utility knife to cut all 
the way through, so you can break the plaster out to the lines, leaving a nice 
straight patch. On an interior wall with old wooden lath backing, you would now 
be down to the wood lath. This is the point to make sure you have solved any 
problem that caused the plaster to crack in the first place -- be it roof 
leaks, plumbing problems or settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The next step is to re-nail any loose lath to the framing. You may then be 
able to take a short cut if the plaster is the exact thickness of a 3/8-inch or 
1/2-inch sheet of drywall and you have exposed studs on both vertical sides to 
nail or screw the drywall patch into. If that's the case, cut a piece of 
drywall to fit, screw the drywall through the lath, and tape and spackle the 
patch to the old plaster as you would any other drywall joint. (You have to 
tape between the old work and the new to keep your final finish from cracking.) 
</P>
<P>
 In most cases, however, the thickness of the plaster will vary considerably, 
so you will have to patch it with plaster. 
</P>
<P>
 For a good bond, nail a layer of galvanized metal lath to the old wooden lath. 
It comes in 2-by-6-foot sheets, so you can patch a pretty big area with one 
sheet. Use one-inch galvanized roofing nails. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the lath is nailed securely, start mixing up the plaster. Begin with a 
coarse plaster (Gypsolite is one brand name) to form what is called the scratch 
coat. Mix it so it is fairly stiff -- you do not want it running down the 
walls. Smear it on the lath with a trowel, pressing so it goes through the 
holes. Build this first layer out so it is almost flush with the old surface. 
On a larger patch, you may need to use a board that reaches from old surface to 
old surface to check the level of the patch. 
</P>
<P>
 Let the Gypsolite dry a day, then skim-coat it -- that is, apply a final thin 
coating of quick-drying finish plaster such as Durabond 90 -- and then tape 
between the old surface and the new. Let the tape dry a bit, and skim over it 
with a light coat of Durabond 90, using a 12-inch drywall knife. It should be a 
light coat because Durabond 90 does not sand well; you want to leave it as 
smooth as possible. For the final coat, you may need to mix a little water into 
the compound to keep it flowing smoothly. 
</P>
<P>
 Once the last layer of plaster dries, skim the tape and the patch with 
ordinary joint compound. Joint compound does sand easily, but if you have been 
careful, you should not need much sanding. 
</P>
<P>
 Keep the compound clean. Always use a small drywall pan or hawk (flat plate 
with a handle on the bottom) and dip fresh drywall out of the bucket at 
intervals. Clean tools thoroughly after each use. Keep the bucket covered. Any 
foreign objects or bits of dried plaster that get into the compound can mar the 
final finish. 
</P>
<P>
 There is a new "light" type of joint compound that is 33% less dense than the 
traditional variety. It is a little harder to apply, at least until you get the 
hang of it, but it works well on ceiling cracks and patches because it is not 
so heavy that it falls out. 
</P>
<P>
 There is nothing worse than standing under someone who is doing a sloppy job 
on a ceiling. Which brings up one more point: It is always a good idea to wear 
a hat.

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; BOY SCOUTS RACE TOWARD INVOLVEMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WILSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As 10-year-old Alvaro Mendoza positioned his small blue car on the wooden 
track, the only thought on his mind was winning. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three years he has participated in the in-school Boy Scouts program at 
Kamala Elementary School in Oxnard, this week's Pinewood Derby was the 
highlight. 
</P>
<P>
 "The funniest thing I've ever done," Alvaro said of the race while rotating 
the quarter-size black tires on his hand-painted car. 
</P>
<P>
 Scout leaders hope that through an expanding minority outreach program, boys 
such as Alvaro will have the opportunity to participate in other activities 
that go beyond their elementaryschool playgrounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ventura County Agriculture for Scouting Project recently raised more than 
$20,000 for Boy Scouts in Ventura County, money that Scout leaders have 
earmarked for the outreach program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We would like to expand it to more kids," said Antonio Garcia, Scout 
executive for the Oxnard and Port Hueneme districts. "And with this money, 
maybe it will enable us to." 
</P>
<P>
 Thirty-two companies from the county's agricultural community recently filled 
two truckloads of produce for sale on the East Coast. The proceeds went to the 
Boy Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the money was used to pay for the materials Alvaro and other boys used 
to make cars for Kamala's Pinewood Derby. 
</P>
<P>
 Other funds will go toward camping and gang-intervention programs. 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia said one of his goals is to get more youths into the Boy Scouts. There 
are now about 400 Scouts in the Oxnard area, contrasted with about 1,800 in 
Thousand Oaks, the largest scouting district in Ventura County. 
</P>
<P>
 "These kids do much better in school, they attend classes more regularly, they 
have better character and discipline," Garcia said of both the regular Boy 
Scouts program and the in-school program. 
</P>
<P>
 The in-school program was designed to involve children in Boy Scouts without 
them having to pay for uniforms or other fees, which total about $60 a year. 
</P>
<P>
 "We provide for those kids who cannot afford the regular Scout troop," Garcia 
said. "Many of these kids are low income, many are Latino. They do pretty much 
everything the Boy Scouts do, they just don't go camping." 
</P>
<P>
 For 10-year-old Alvaro, that is a crucial difference.  
</P>
<P>
 "I would like to go camping," the boy said. But being a Boy Scout "costs too 
much money." 
</P>
<P>
 Garcia hopes to change that. 
</P>
<P>
 Last week he started what he calls a "uniform bank," a place where boys can 
borrow uniforms until they outgrow them. 
</P>
<P>
 Only two uniforms have been donated so far, but Garcia is optimistic. He hopes 
to collect about 100. 
</P>
<P>
 He also hopes local businesses will kick in and sponsor Oxnard youths who want 
to be Scouts. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of these kids, they don't get rewards," Garcia said. "And we provide 
that." TRACY WILSON

COUNTY PUBLIC DEFENDER, MOORPARK PHILANTHROPIST HONORED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MACK REED 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A county public defender and a Moorpark philanthropist were honored for their 
work Friday by the Ventura County Criminal Defense Bar Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Todd Howeth and Moorpark resident Claire Hope each 
received the Joyce Yoshioka Award for their contributions to the county's 
criminal justice system. 
</P>
<P>
 The award is named for Yoshioka, former chief deputy public defender who died 
of ovarian cancer at age 42 in 1990. At the time, she was the highest-ranking 
woman in any public defender's office in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Howeth, a four-year veteran of the Ventura County office who spent six years 
in the Orange County public defender's office, "is a very hard worker who is 
being recognized for his litigation skills," Assistant Public Defender Jean 
Farley said in an interview Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He is not afraid to litigate just about anything," and has been particularly 
successful in winning acquittal for defendants who were innocent despite 
apparently strong evidence against them, said Farley, who helped coordinate the 
awards. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope received the civilian award for her work with homeless Vietnam War 
veterans. 
</P>
<P>
 Hope has organized "stand-downs," marshaling doctors, dentists, lawyers, job 
counselors and supplies of food and clothing together in tent villages on the 
Ventura College campus to serve the veterans, Farley said. 
</P>
<P>
 "What she does is organize these things . . . to try and put these people back 
on their feet and get them headed in the right direction so they can be 
productive members of society," Farley said. MACK REED

A LOSS TO THE DISTRICT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana Unified School District needs a breath of fresh air but it won't 
happen when (Superintendent) Rudy Castruita leaves the district ("Castruita 
Will Quit Santa Ana School District," June 1). The breath of fresh air will 
come when the conservative Christian groups who oppose school reform are voted 
out of office. 
</P>
<P>
 Talk about no class, (board member) Tom Chaffee makes a remark in regards to 
Castruita leaving by saying we "need a breath of fresh air and I can't say I'm 
sorry to see him go." Nice going, Tom. Why not just wish him well and let it go 
at that? 
</P>
<P>
 Watch out folks! Pay attention because these Christian conservative groups are 
infiltrating many school districts with unrealistic ideas and no idea of what 
is really going on in schools today. During Castruita's reign, there have been 
two National Blue Ribbon Schools and 10 California Distinguished School awards. 
Three schools were honored last month but some board members seem to find fault 
with everything Dr. Castruita and a hard-working staff have accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Wonderful things are happening in schools today but people like (Rosemarie) 
Avila and Chaffee do not build but tear down and in turn lose will, lose 
superior administrators and teachers because of their ignorance -- or is this 
their plan?

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; A BITTER LESSON IN HUNTINGTON BEACH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For many, Huntington Beach symbolizes the lifestyle of "The Endless Summer," a 
city of sun, surf, clean air and a relaxed, carefree manner. The city of course 
is much more than a waterfront Shangri-La; it has its fair share of wrangling 
over development issues, and it has some of the same political battles as other 
places. Perhaps nothing symbolizes that mundane side of the community as much 
as the recent pension scandal, involving the inflation of public employees' 
salaries to enlarge the benefits package at retirement time. 
</P>
<P>
 The numbers are now in and the city has learned the difficult lesson of the 
scandal. It will cost $13 million to close the gap in the unfinanced portion of 
pension obligations for retired or about-to-retire city employees whose 
pensions have been artificially inflated by adding sick leave, vacation days, 
automobile allowances and other perks. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem never should have happened in the first place, and the city must 
resolve to prevent the recurrence of anything like it. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, new state legislation that will go into effect in July should curtail 
most of the problems associated with public employees inflating their pensions 
as retirement nears. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Huntington Beach was one of several California cities cited two years 
ago in an audit that grew out of allegations of pension fraud in a Sacramento 
County fire protection district. 
</P>
<P>
 The city now will be stuck for most of the shortfall. The liability that will 
fall to the city, and to the state as well, essentially came about because 
these inflated pension benefits were approved without due consideration to the 
obvious problem of not having sufficient funds in pension accounts to cover the 
new obligations. 
</P>
<P>
 A committee of the City Council is investigating the matter, but it is clear 
already -- as Councilman David Sullivan, chairman of the subcommittee, suggests 
-- that past city councils probably were never briefed adequately on the fiscal 
ramifications of allowing the pension spiking to occur. No doubt, had they been 
they would have recognized that the numbers did not justify this commitment to 
retiring employees. 
</P>
<P>
 Clearly, a city can't make pension obligations that it doesn't have the money 
to cover. For the city, it turns out that the average underfunded cost of a 
spiked pension for a retired employee -- such as a police officer or 
firefighter -- was $104,939. What a painful lesson. The city appears to be 
getting some help from the state's Public Employees' Retirement System, but 
that will only ease some of the fiscal discomfort.

SPLASH MARKS DEBUT BY BEATING LAS VEGAS; SOCCER: IT SCORES SIX CONSECUTIVE 
GOALS TO DEFEAT THE DUSTDEVILS, 7-4.ERVINE HAS THREE GOALS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Splash showed 4,721 fans at The Pond of Anaheim that it was composed, 
deliberate and skilled. It also showed it was lucky. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash scored six consecutive goals to defeat Las Vegas, 7-4, Friday night 
in its Continental Indoor Soccer League debut. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash trailed by three goals 12 minutes into the third quarter but 
rallied with six consecutive goals, including two by Dale Ervine in the fourth 
quarter, that gave the former indoor soccer scoring champion the hat trick. He 
also scored the first goal in franchise history to tie the score, 1-1. 
</P>
<P>
 The late dividends were a reward for an evening of frustration despite 
pounding away at Las Vegas goalkeeper Brett Phillips, who finished with 20 
saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Splash Coach George Fernandez's fears that his team would get caught up in the 
excitement of a league opener were well-founded. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very erratic, sporadic," Fernandez said of his team's first-half 
performance. "We were trying to do too much individually. We were trying to win 
the game every time we got the ball." 
</P>
<P>
 They got their shots. And they missed -- a few inches here, a few inches 
there. The Splash outshot the Dustdevils, 42-17. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got better and better as the game got longer," Fernandez said. "We started 
getting a little more into the game because we weren't operating on adrenaline. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to win the majority of our games if we play like we did in the 
second half." 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash took its first lead 6 minutes 22 seconds into the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 Ervine's goal from the right side -- after Paul Ratcliffe's nifty pass from 
the top of the goalie arc -- gave the Splash its first lead, 5-4. It came just 
after the crowd began to make noise for the first time without help from the 
public address announcer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ratcliffe scored five minutes later, and Ervine capped scoring off a pass from 
Denis Hamlett. 
</P>
<P>
 Armando Valdivia began the comeback 12:08 into the third quarter, and Rod 
Castro scored at the 13:12 mark. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamlett tied the game 27 seconds into the fourth. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dustdevils, on the strength of three goals in a row, had a 4-1 lead 3:38 
into the third quarter. 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash dominated the first quarter and outshot the Dustdevils, 12-2, but 
neither team scored.  
</P>
<P>
 Branko Segota gave Las Vegas a 1-0 lead 4:03 into the second quarter with a 
left-footed crossing shot inside the far post. Notes 
</P>
<P>
 The Splash plays host to San Jose tonight. It will be the expansion Grizzlies' 
first game. . . . Portland defeated Detroit, 7-5, Friday in front of a CISL 
record 14,258 fans at The Palace in Auburn Hills, Mich. San Diego defeated 
Monterrey, 10-7, in front of a sellout crowd of 3,500 in Mexico . . . CISL 
Commissioner Ron Weinstein attended the Splash's game. He said he wasn't 
surprised by the attendance. "Knowing the track record of Southern California, 
I think they're taking a show-me approach," he said. "Right now it's just an 
exposure problem, and it's going to take a company like Ogden (Facility 
Management) to get the product out there. The Southern California area is 
critical for the league. We definitely need a Los Angeles-Orange County 
presence. I think it's imperative to have a market here. It's the No. 1 market 
for soccer in the country. If it can't work in Orange County, the league can't 
have too much chance for success."

CHECKING OUT; JAPAN BANK TO SELL RITZ-CARLTON, OTHER ASSETS; STEEP LOSS SEEN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID W. MYERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<P>
 In the latest sign that Japanese investors are abandoning the U.S. market 
nearly as fast as they came here a decade ago, the Tokyo-based bank that owns 
the Ritz-Carlton Huntington Hotel in Pasadena is trying to sell the landmark 
facility at what is expected to be a steep loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The 383-room complex, rebuilt from the ground up after the original Huntington 
was declared seismically unsafe in 1985, is one of 10 California properties and 
loans that banking giant Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank Ltd. hopes to unload in a package 
sale, sources familiar with the hotel and the bank said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The other properties include the L'Auberge Del Mar Resort & Spa near San 
Diego, condominiums and undeveloped land. 
</P>
<P>
 The entire portfolio has an estimated book value of $200 million, sources 
familiar with the offering said, but it is expected to fetch far less because 
values have plunged since Dai-Ichi began its U.S. buying and lending spree in 
the 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese seem to be retreating nearly as fast as they came here," said 
Linda McKenzie, senior manager of the hotel division of consulting firm Ernst & 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Japanese investors began a prolonged buying spree in the United States during 
the mid-1980s, as they sought to reinvest their profits from a prolonged real 
estate and stock market boom in Tokyo. At the time, American real estate was 
far less expensive than similar properties in Japan and offered returns that 
were far greater. 
</P>
<P>
 But California's real estate market, which once accounted for more than half 
of all Japanese investment in the United States, collapsed in about 1990 as the 
state slid into a deep recession. At the same time, Japan's economy also began 
to deteriorate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Japanese were blindsided by recessions on both sides of the Pacific," 
said Jack Rodman, chief of Kenneth Leventhal & Co.'s hotel consulting 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at Los Angeles-based Secured Capital Corp., the financial advisers 
handling the sale for Dai-Ichi, would not comment Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 However, real estate specialists familiar with the efforts to sell the hotel 
say Dai-Ichi is hoping to get about $65 million. The bank took control of the 
hotel last month, after the U.S. investors who rebuilt the hotel a few years 
ago could no longer make the payments on their $100-million loan.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is an unfortunate situation for all parties concerned," Dai-Ichi Vice 
President Julian Harmon said. "At this point, that is all I really have to 
say." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Dai-Ichi may be lucky if it is able to keep its losses under $40 
million, some hotel experts say. 
</P>
<P>
 Southern California's hotel market has been hammered -- first by the 
recession, then by the 1992 riots and most recently by the Northridge 
earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 While hotels in most other parts of the nation are seeing occupancy and rental 
rates rise, levels have been flat in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't see Dai-Ichi getting more than $45 million for the hotel," one local 
hotel broker said. "'If they get 50 cents on a dollar, they'll be damn lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 Just two months ago, another Japanese lender -- Long Term Credit Bank of Japan 
-- took control of the swank Hotel Bel-Air in West Los Angeles after its owners 
could no longer make the loan payments.

BANKAMERICA COVERS LOSS OF $17.4 MILLION IN MONEY FUND; INVESTMENTS: IT BECOMES 
THE LATEST INSTITUTION TO TAKE A DERIVATIVES-RELATED HIT. INDUSTRY EXPERTS SEE 
NO SIGN OF CRISIS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 BankAmerica Corp. has become the latest mutual fund sponsor to cover 
shareholder losses caused by so-called derivative securities -- in this case, 
in a money market fund, BofA confirmed Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But while more such disclosures are expected from normally "safe" money funds 
between now and the end of the quarter, industry experts and regulators say the 
funds' problems appear manageable and are unlikely to be widespread. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't see this as a major crisis," one Securities and Exchange Commission 
official in Washington said. 
</P>
<P>
 BofA confirmed that it injected $17.4 million into its Pacific Horizon Prime 
Money Market fund in May to cover losses on securities the fund was forced to 
sell at a loss before they matured. 
</P>
<P>
 The cash injection allowed the fund to keep its share price constant at $1, 
which is one of the hallmarks of money funds. 
</P>
<P>
 Generally, money fund shareholders expect the value of their principal to 
remain steady; fund managers normally maintain share price stability by 
limiting their investments to fixed-income securities maturing within an 
average of 90 days. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Pacific Horizon Prime fund -- used mostly by institutional investors 
-- suffered a double whammy in March and April, BofA said. As short-term market 
interest rates zoomed, hordes of its institutional holders pulled their cash 
out of the fund to invest directly in money market securities. 
</P>
<P>
 The fund's assets have plunged from a peak of $12 billion earlier in the year 
to $4.6 billion now. 
</P>
<P>
 Forced to liquidate securities to meet redemptions, the fund suffered losses 
on certain investments that had dropped in value because their yields were less 
than what was available on the open market, as rates spiked. 
</P>
<P>
 BofA said those securities included some money market "derivatives" -- hybrid, 
often volatile investments whose returns are derived from, or tied to, interest 
rate trends. The company would not identify the specific derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
 Industry analysts say it is typical for institutional money funds to 
experience outflows in times of rising interest rates as big investors buy 
securities directly. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts questioned why the Pacific Horizon fund, which is accustomed 
to heavy inflows and outflows of cash, would risk investment in derivative 
money market instruments that are generally higher-risk. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like they were buying securities inappropriate for" them, said one 
rival money fund manager who requested anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
 A BofA spokesman in San Francisco asserted that "it wouldn't have mattered 
what we had in the portfolio," because the surge in market interest rates, 
coupled with dramatic redemptions, forced the fund into a loss situation. 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts disputed that, noting that the Pacific Horizon fund's yield has 
been above average all year, which by definition means the fund is taking 
above-average risk. The current yield on the fund is 3.74%, compared to a 3.57% 
average for all money funds, according to fund tracker IBC/Donoghue in Ashland, 
Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past two months, several other funds have incurred 
interest-rate-related losses that have been covered by their parent companies. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, oil giant Atlantic Richfield Co. said it would make up a $22-million 
loss caused by derivative securities in a money-market-like employee retirement 
fund. 
</P>
<P>
 And this week, brokerage Paine Webber Group Inc. agreed to put $33 million 
into a government bond fund it manages, in order to repay investors for 
derivative-related losses incurred as interest rates rose. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal regulators note that there have been other cases in recent years -- 
involving money funds in particular -- of unusual losses being covered to avoid 
angering shareholders. 
</P>
<P>
 SEC officials say they believe that a relatively small number of money funds 
have covered minor losses this spring but that they have no reason to believe 
the problems are endemic in the money fund business, given the generally 
conservative nature of most such funds.

WHOLESALE PRICES FALL 0.1%, BUT RISE IN 'CORE INDEX' WORRIES ANALYSTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A drop in food and energy costs pulled wholesale prices down in May for the 
second month in a row -- the first time in nearly three years that has 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts said a larger-than-expected increase in underlying 
inflation, including higher prices for tobacco, cars and women's clothing, 
could signal trouble ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said Friday that the producer price index, a gauge of 
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was down 0.1% last month. 
That matched April's decline and marked the first time since June and July, 
1991, that the index declined for two straight months. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core index 
rose 0.4% in May after edging up 0.1% the preceding month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very poor number," said economist Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin 
& Jenrette Securities Corp. "The core rate was double what was expected. It 
seems to be concentrated in apparel, automobiles and tobacco prices. It's 
certainly a short-run negative for the bond market." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the Federal Reserve Board, which has boosted short-term 
interest rates four times this year, will probably find the rising core rate 
disturbing and may send interest rates higher in August. 
</P>
<P>
 "On the surface, inflationary pressure is subdued," said Wall Street economist 
Eugene Sherman of M.A. Schapiro & Co. "But beneath the surface, commodity 
prices are rising faster for the last six to 10 months. There is emerging 
scarcity in the labor market and among producers in terms of capacity 
availability. Normally, all of these things precede price inflation." 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no compelling reason for the Fed to do anything. Things are settling 
down," said Donald Ratajczak, who heads an economic forecasting project at 
Georgia State University in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts and investors are awaiting Wednesday's consumer price index report 
for May, which is expected to show a small increase. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, a consensus forecast of 52 prominent analysts surveyed in early 
June by Blue Chip Economic Indicators predicted that consumer prices will rise 
just 2.7% this year, unchanged from 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The group said it foresees improved productivity because of pressures from 
foreign competition, corporate restructuring and modernizing. It also predicted 
that prices will be restrained by the Fed's interest rate increases. 
</P>
<P>
 Inflation has been mild for more than three years, the best stretch in three 
decades. Last year's 2.7% rise followed a 2.9% advance in 1992 and a 3.1% 
increase in 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Wholesale food prices dropped 0.9% after declining 0.5% in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Energy costs slid 1% in May, with gasoline down 2.8% after a 1% advance in 
April. 
</P>
<P>
 Passenger car prices were up 0.8% after a 0.3% advance in April. Tobacco 
products posted a 1.9% gain after decreasing 0.9%. Women's apparel rose 1.1% 
after declining an identical amount the month before. Producer Price Index

 Barney the dinosaur can sing "I Love You" without worrying about the legal 
consequences, now that agreement has been reached in a court dispute over the 
song. 
</P>
<P>
 The deal was accepted this week by Jean Warren of Everett, who claimed rights 
to the lyrics, and Lyons Group of Dallas, which owns the dinosaur 
character.Terms were not disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
 Warren sued Lyons 18 months ago, claiming she held the rights to Barney's 
unofficial theme song. The words -- as any toddler knows -- are, "I love you, 
you love me, we're a happy family, with a great big hug and a kiss from me to 
you. Won't you say you love me too?" 
</P>
<P>
 One of Barney's co-creators heard the tune in a Gymboree class her child 
attended during the mid-'80s.

 Teledyne Pares Marina del Rey Work Force: The diversified company said it laid 
off 73 people at its Teledyne Electronic Technologies unit, which makes 
microelectronics primarily for the Defense Department. The layoffs, covering 
all types of positions, represented 9% of the unit's 782 workers and were 
blamed on reduced Pentagon contracts. Teledyne, based in Century City, makes a 
variety of aerospace, industrial and consumer goods.

INFLATION NEWS AIDS STOCKS, BUT YIELDS RISE TOO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Stocks posted solid gains Friday on surprisingly mild inflation data, but less 
favorable aspects of the report sent long-term bond yields higher and the 
dollar lower. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average rose 20.31 to 3,773.45, up 1.23 for the week. 
In the broader market, advancing issues outnumbered decliners by about 4 to 3 
on the New York Stock Exchange, where volume totaled 222.62 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
 The stocks of economically sensitive companies rose after the Labor Department 
reported that the producer price index fell 0.1% in May -- the second straight 
monthly drop in a row -- compared to an expected increase of 0.2%. 
</P>
<P>
 The drop in the price index lessened the threat of further credit tightening 
by the Federal Reserve Board, which has raised short-term interest rates four 
times this year. 
</P>
<P>
 But the bond and currency markets were alarmed by a 0.4% rise in the so-called 
core producer price index, which excludes volatile food and energy prices. 
</P>
<P>
 The increase was the biggest since January and was slightly higher than the 
0.3% that analysts were predicting. It suggested that the Fed's moves to raise 
interest rates this year may not have choked off economic growth, as had been 
feared. 
</P>
<P>
 This caused nervousness among bond- and dollar-based investors, who fear that 
the value of their holdings might be eroded. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond closed at 7.31% from 7.27% on 
Thursday. Its price, which moves in the opposite direction, fell 6/16 point, or 
$3.75 per $1,000 in face value.  
</P>
<P>
 The dollar followed bonds lower in listless trading. In New York, the 
greenback ended the day at 103.50 Japanese yen, down from Thursday's 103.95. It 
also fell to 1.667 German marks, down from 1.669. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Among cyclical issues in the 30 stocks that make up the Dow average, 
Caterpillar rose 1 5/8 to 105 1/8, International Paper added 7/8 to 70 1/8 and 
Alcoa advanced 1 3/4 to 73. 
</P>
<P>
 * Steel stocks advanced on heavy volume after J.P. Morgan Securities analyst 
Michael Gambardella said the stocks are a good buy as the industry begins to 
recover. Bethlehem Steel, also a Dow 30 component, rose 1 3/8 to 21 1/8; Inland 
Steel rose 1 1/2 to 35 1/4, and USX-US Steel added 7/8 to 34 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Oil stocks rose following oil prices, which were firmer for most of the 
session but closed slightly lower. British Petroleum rose 2 3/8 to 71, Chevron 
advanced 1 1/8 to 90 3/4, and Mobil added 1 1/8 to 82 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Semiconductor stocks rose following favorable book-to-bill shipment figures 
released by the industry Thursday. Texas Instruments rose 2 3/8 to 77 1/4. 
Intel added 63/64 to 59 63/64. Motorola advanced 1 1/4 to 46. 
</P>
<P>
 * Of the auto makers, Ford move up 7/8 to 57 1/8, Chrysler ended 3/8 higher at 
47 and General Motors climbed 5/8 to 51 3/8. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas stocks were mixed. London's Financial Times 100-share average closed 
up 27 points at 3,055.9, a rise of 58.1 since last Friday. Frankfurt's blue 
chip average closed 3.76 points higher at 2,133.08. 
</P>
<P>
 In Tokyo, the Nikkei 225-share average ended down 7.60 points at 21,395.18, 
while Mexico City's Bolsa index finished down 27.81 points at 2,385.55.

 Teamsters to Move Quickly to Close Conferences: Union President Ron Carey said 
he will begin closing the four U.S. regional conferences early next week, and a 
court rejected opponents' pleas to stop him. Dissidents had asked a federal 
judge in New York to impose a temporary restraining order to stop Carey from 
immediately closing the conferences, as approved in a vote Thursday by the 
Teamsters' executive board. But U.S. District Judge David N. Edelstein in 
Manhattan rejected the request for a temporary restraining order, saying the 
regional conferences had "failed once again to show that they will suffer 
irreparable injury."

S&P RATING FOR 20TH CENTURY INSURANCE UNITS LOWERED AGAIN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Standard & Poor's on Friday again lowered its rating of the claims-paying 
ability of 20th Century Industries' two insurance units, citing their 
earthquake-depleted surplus. Another major rating firm, A.M. Best, said it 
plans to take similar action Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 A downgrade can hurt a company's sales or its ability to raise money from 
investors or lenders, but analysts were doubtful whether Friday's action will 
have much impact on 20th Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're hearing the rifle shot after the bullet has passed," one California 
insurance industry insider said, explaining that 20th Century has already taken 
action to improve its condition. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, 20th Century announced an agreement with the state Insurance 
Department under which it has stopped selling new homeowners and earthquake 
insurance and will phase out its existing residential business over the next 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
 The insurer's 90,000 earthquake policyholders must find new coverage by their 
next annual renewal date. The 240,000 homeowners policyholders will be entitled 
to two more renewals. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's downgrade was the third the Woodland Hills-based insurer has received 
from S&P since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake, which cost it an estimated 
$600 million in claims and wiped out two-thirds of its surplus, or cushion 
against losses. 
</P>
<P>
 S&P dropped the rating to B from BB. Both ratings are within the "vulnerable" 
range. The new rating applies to 20th Century Insurance Co. and its sister, 
21st Century Casualty Co. 
</P>
<P>
 S&P said that although the withdrawal improves 20th Century's financial 
outlook, the company remains vulnerable to another earthquake during the next 
year as its current policies expire. 
</P>
<P>
 A.M. Best said that on Monday it will cut 20th Century's rating by two 
notches, to B+ from A-. The new rating is the lowest of six "financially 
secure" categories.

BENEFITS OF ENDING ALASKA OIL BAN DISPUTED; ENERGY: OPPONENTS OF LIFTING THE 
FEDERAL RESTRAINTS SAY SUCH A MOVE WOULD NOT LEAD TO JOB GAINS IN CALIFORNIA. 
</P>

 Opponents of ending the federal ban on Alaskan crude oil exports released a 
study Friday that questions whether lifting the prohibition would create jobs 
in California, as the state's independent producers and U.S. Department of 
Energy research predict. 
</P>
<P>
 The new study disputes the argument that West Coast oil prices are 
artificially depressed by the export ban, as the Energy Department and 
producers claim. And it contends that freeing Alaskan crude to be sold on Asian 
markets, instead of forcing it south into California and the Gulf Coast region, 
would not create more demand for California crude. 
</P>
<P>
 If so, lifting the ban would not prompt a spurt of new investment, production 
and jobs in California and Alaska, as proponents maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's no way that we'll pay one dime more for (that) oil," said Peter A. 
Sutton, senior vice president for supply and marketing at Tosco Refining Co. in 
Concord, Calif., one of the backers of the study.  
</P>
<P>
 "They're not going to see an increase in jobs, because they're not going to 
see an increase in production," Sutton said, echoing the study's findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Sutton said California's refineries cannot handle more heavy California crude 
even if some of the lighter Alaska crude does go overseas. He predicted that 
refiners would either bring in lighter crudes from the Persian Gulf, the Far 
East and Ecuador or simply pay a premium to keep receiving Alaskan crude. 
</P>
<P>
 But Thomas G. Burns, manager of economics at Chevron Corp. -- which supports 
lifting the ban -- believes it would raise West Coast crude prices a modest $1 
to $2 a barrel, encouraging investment in production. He also said California's 
refineries could handle more heavy oil. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration is expected to endorse lifting the ban before its 
meeting Thursday in Washington to discuss problems in the domestic petroleum 
industry with Sen. David L. Boren (D-Okla.) and other key lawmakers from 
oil-producing states. 
</P>
<P>
 The study was backed by the Coalition to Keep Alaska Oil. Members include 
Tosco; the consumer advocacy group Citizen Action; the Port of Portland, Ore., 
which has the major maintenance facility for Alaskan crude tankers, and other 
refiners and industry groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists are generally opposed to lifting the ban as well, fearing 
that higher crude prices could put pressure on Congress to allow oil 
exploration in wilderness areas.

 Microsoft Hit by Infringement Order: A federal judge in Los Angeles issued a 
permanent injunction that bars the Redmond, Wash., company from selling one 
version of its DOS 6 software and directs it to recall the product from stores 
and distributors.The order by U.S. District Judge Edward Rafeedie follows a 
Feb. 23 jury decision that Microsoft Corp.'s DoubleSpace technology infringes 
two patents owned by Stac Electronics. Stac, based in Carlsbad, Calif., is a 
supplier of compression products for increasing the storage capacity of 
personal computers. The jury awarded Stac $120 million in damages against 
Microsoft, which has said it will appeal the award. Rafeedie's ruling had been 
expected.

DROP IN WHOLESALE PRICES FAILS TO EASE WORRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A drop in food and energy costs pulled wholesale prices down in May for the 
second month in a row -- the first time in nearly three years that has 
happened. 
</P>
<P>
 But some analysts said a larger-than-expected increase in underlying 
inflation, including higher prices for tobacco, cars and women's clothing, 
could signal trouble ahead. 
</P>
<P>
 The Labor Department said Friday that the producer price index, a gauge of 
inflation pressures before they reach the consumer, was down 0.1% last month. 
That matched April's decline and marked the first time since June and July, 
1991, that the index declined for two straight months. 
</P>
<P>
 Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the so-called core index 
rose 0.4% in May after edging up 0.1% the preceding month. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very poor number," said economist Elliott Platt of Donaldson, Lufkin 
& Jenrette Securities Corp. "The core rate was double what was expected. It 
seems to be concentrated in apparel, automobiles and tobacco prices. It's 
certainly a short-run negative for the bond market." 
</P>
<P>
 Some analysts said the Federal Reserve Board, which has boosted short-term 
interest rates four times this year, will probably find the rising core rate 
disturbing and may send interest rates higher in August. 
</P>
<P>
 However one expert, Donald Ratajczak, who heads an economic forecasting 
project at Georgia State University in Atlanta, said, "There is no compelling 
reason for the Fed to do anything. Things are settling down."

FACED WITH A DIRE OUTLOOK, SMALL GROWERS PERSEVERING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHANIE SIMON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He has a master's degree in business from Harvard, a bachelor's in economics 
from Stanford and some blunt advice for the farmers at Underwood Ranches. 
</P>
<P>
 Liquidate. 
</P>
<P>
 If the partners auctioned off their tractors and sold their land, they would 
no doubt reap a hefty sum. Enough, surely, to invest in a solid mutual fund, 
kick back and watch the dividends roll in. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, that's how consultant Bill Knoke figures it. 
</P>
<P>
 Hired to draft a long-term strategy for Underwood Ranches, Knoke discovered 
that the most sensible course might be the most radical. Half tongue-in-cheek, 
he recommended that the farmers abandon farming. 
</P>
<P>
 "People in agriculture do it for the love of agriculture and not to make 
money, and that's a problem," Knoke said. "They'd be better off liquidating 
everything. They could invest the money and earn 10% without even working for 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 Solid economic students themselves, the three partners who dominate Underwood 
Ranches understand their consultant's advice. 
</P>
<P>
 But follow it? No way. 
</P>
<P>
 Not now. 
</P>
<P>
 Not now, when the first, optimistic shoots of corn have begun to stretch their 
lady-finger leaves on the rich dirt known as Conejo Ranch. Not now, when they 
see promising new products in the pipeline, crops never before sold in North 
America. 
</P>
<P>
 No, not now. But the idea lingers, tempting. 
</P>
<P>
 As spring sags into summer, the three worry about markets and weather and 
pests. "There's always a fear of becoming another statistic," Craig Underwood 
says, to knowing nods. "When prices are down, you wonder if they'll ever turn 
around." 
</P>
<P>
 That fear has grown especially sharp because of the ferocious competition 
roaring through the produce industry. Agribusiness conglomerates are now eyeing 
lucrative niche crops, such as baby carrots and esoteric salad greens, which 
were once the exclusive province of smaller farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 The big boys of vegetables -- the Doles and Del Montes -- are poised for a 
killing. And on their 60-acre patch outside Camarillo, the Underwood partners 
feel the threat. 
</P>
<P>
 Their specialties, such as the gourmet greens that flourished on Conejo Ranch 
last season, no longer seem quite so special. Their sure things are undeniably 
unsure. 
</P>
<P>
 So in some ways, the advice to liquidate makes sense. Especially since Conejo 
Ranch -- newly cleared and leveled, commanding majestic mountain views -- might 
fetch a good price from developers. 
</P>
<P>
 But the farmers are not yet ready to give up. 
</P>
<P>
 They sunk nearly $575,000 into Conejo Ranch last spring, buying the field with 
borrowed money and borrowing more to prepare it for farming. 
</P>
<P>
 It's the only piece of property the three hold title to. They work other 
fields in Ventura County, have for years, but those plots are rented from 
absentee landlords. Conejo Ranch is theirs. 
</P>
<P>
 Theirs to farm -- and theirs to gamble on. 
</P>
<P>
 In buying the field for vegetables, the partners bucked a nationwide trend. 
Strip malls and golf courses have sprouted everywhere, gobbling up huge swaths 
of agricultural soil. Nearly 2 million acres of United States farmland vanish 
each year, paved under to make way for homes and shops and parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 As little guys in the produce industry, the Underwood Ranches partners 
understand the pressures that prompt farmers to divest. Yet, tugged toward the 
land, they find agriculture all but irresistible. 
</P>
<P>
 "When it's good," partner Jim Roberts says, "it's really sweet." 
</P>
<P>
 So far this year, it's been just shy of sweet. 
</P>
<P>
 The ranchers have plucked a first crop of salad greens from Conejo Ranch, the 
60-acre plot that they bought with borrowed money nearly a year ago. They sold 
about three-quarters of the harvest, at moderate prices, and mashed the rest 
into the soil to decompose -- a colorful, all-organic fertilizer. 
</P>
<P>
 The greens, turnips and radishes proved "an average crop," Roberts said. 
Roberts hopes for better luck with Conejo Ranch's next crop. 
</P>
<P>
 While the partners will continue to grow mixed greens on the fields they rent 
from absentee landlords, they've already begun planting a summer stand of corn 
on Conejo Ranch. 
</P>
<P>
 The partners at Underwood Ranches are counting on corn in a big way this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Not the standard, green-jacketed corn sold for a quarter an ear, with the long 
silk tassels and the occasional, startling maggot. The corn they'll sell is an 
upscale, easy-to-deal-with version -- pre-cut, pre-husked, and guaranteed 
worm-free. 
</P>
<P>
 Three years ago, the partners' first attempt at marketing the ready-to-eat 
Somis Creek Corn flopped miserably. 
</P>
<P>
 The corn itself was good, they said, so sweet and tender that you could eat it 
raw. But demand was low -- very low. Underwood ended up plowing under about 
half the crop, leaving it to rot in the fields. 
</P>
<P>
 Burned once, the partners cut way back on corn production last summer. Now, 
however, they're ready to try again, backed by $80,000 worth of equipment that 
should fully automate the picking, husking, trimming and wrapping. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone has their fingers crossed," Underwood said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretive about their sales figures, the partners are reluctant to publicize 
exactly how many acres of corn they're planting this year. But all of Conejo 
Ranch will be covered, plus some rented fields. 
</P>
<P>
 It's an unusual tack for Ventura County, where corn accounts for less than 1% 
of vegetable crop sales each year. On the agricultural commissioner's scale of 
crop value, corn ranks below even obscure vegetables like kale and cilantro. 
</P>
<P>
 But at Underwood Ranches, the partners see their corn as an ideal "value 
added" product -- a semi-prepared fresh vegetable that will command higher 
prices than the husk-it-yourself variety. 
</P>
<P>
 The trio has concentrated on marketing value-added products, from bagged salad 
to peeled carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 Problem is, their competitors have the same idea. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfect for the harried but health-conscious shopper, ready-to-eat products 
fly off the shelves. Industry insiders rhapsodize about value-added veggies in 
sound bites studded with superlatives: Explosive! Exciting! The wave of the 
future! 
</P>
<P>
 At least 70% of the new produce items introduced in American supermarkets over 
the past two years have been semi-processed fruits and vegetables, from bagged 
salads to pre-cracked coconuts, according to a Fresh Cut survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Toss in the statistic that the average American eats about 90 pounds of fresh 
vegetables a year, and you have agribusiness executives everywhere salivating 
about the brave new world of ready-to-eat produce. 
</P>
<P>
 And when the big guys salivate, the little guys sweat. 
</P>
<P>
 With their limited resources -- several hundred employees and sales of less 
than $10 million a year -- the Underwood partners cannot begin to compete with 
the produce behemoths steadily moving into the prepared-veggie market. 
</P>
<P>
 One competitor, Ready Pac, boasts the world's largest vegetable processing 
plant in Irwindale, along with 1,000 employees and $130 million in annual 
sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready Pac's dazzling line of salads dominates many supermarket produce aisles, 
the crinkly plastic bags screaming fuchsia and mustard-colored enticements to 
buyers. 
</P>
<P>
 There's the Farm Fresh Salad, for example: iceberg lettuce tossed with carrot 
and cabbage strings. There's the Caeser Salad Kit: romaine lettuce, croutons 
and a sealed bag of dressing. There's even a Santa Barbara Salad: mixed greens 
sprinkled with tangy radicchio. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look like geniuses -- everything we put on the shelf sells," said Chris 
Nelson, Ready Pac's chief operating officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Ready Pac has boomed so quickly that demand sometimes outstrips supply. 
Ironically, Nelson has been forced, on occasion, to buy salad greens from 
Underwood Ranches to fill his own bags. 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Nelson praises the partners as "very ethical, excellent people" 
and calls Underwood Ranches "a quality house." He uses their salad as a backup 
for his Spring Mix, he said, adding, "I can't speak highly enough of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Nor can he compete fast enough with them. 
</P>
<P>
 With more and more competitors entering the fray, the Underwood partners 
realize their salad days could soon end. 
</P>
<P>
 They generally expect to get a two- to three-year "ride" out of each product, 
before bigger companies come along and outpace them. That window of 
profitability looks precariously close to slamming shut on the gourmet salad 
mixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have some technical advantages that are helping us maintain our position," 
Jim Roberts said. "And we have some degree of loyalty (from buyers) because we 
were the first with the salad. But (competitors) have deep pockets." 
</P>
<P>
 Deep pockets that buy a lot. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got armies of people with Ph.D.s working in our technology department," 
boasts Ready Pac's Nelson. "We have $2-million washing lines and (small 
farmers) are using Kenmore washing machines. That's literally the difference." 
</P>
<P>
 Nelson's description is right on target. The Underwood partners actually did 
start out drying their lettuce in Speed Queen laundry machines, plunking in 
quarters and revving up the spin cycle. 
</P>
<P>
 They also experimented with a low-cost, low-tech method of peeling baby 
carrots: churning them in a cement mixer with a few handfuls of railroad 
gravel. 
</P>
<P>
 "It worked real well," Underwood recalled, "but the carrots were kind of 
gritty." 
</P>
<P>
 Gritty, and ferreous. Traces of iron, possibly from the railroad gravel, stuck 
to the carrots. The veggies didn't taste metallic, but they did set off magnets 
on the packinghouse assembly line. 
</P>
<P>
 Perfecting the production and packaging of baby carrots took nearly three 
years. Developing the salad mixture, and the corn now growing on Conejo Ranch, 
each took three years as well. 
</P>
<P>
 After so much research, the partners feel confident they have a winning corn 
product. Yet they're equally sure that competitors will soon be hot on their 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's so easy in this business for people to copy what you're doing," 
Underwood said. "We may spend three years developing a product, and once it's 
on the market, within six months someone else can copy it." 
</P>
<P>
 Copying is one way to go about it. Stealing is another. 
</P>
<P>
 Agricultural espionage, rare in past decades, has become an irritating worry 
for modern-day farmers. 
</P>
<P>
 In one spectacular case, a carrot grower in Bakersfield publicly accused a 
competitor of sneaking around at night to sketch and measure a brand-new, 
unpatented harvesting machine. The alleged spy, Dave Yurosek, admitted to The 
Times last summer that "we had a lot of ideas and went out and confirmed it on 
(the rival's) machine." 
</P>
<P>
 Such incidents help explain why Ready Pac posts round-the-clock security 
guards at every plant. To prevent leaks, the company also keeps employees away 
from the most sensitive machines, letting them into the processing rooms only 
on a "need-to-know basis," Nelson said. 
</P>
<P>
 Secrecy has become such an obsession that the National Assn. of Fresh Produce 
Processors has a hard time getting an accurate picture of the $4 billion-a-year 
value-added industry. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the trade group's own members refused to give out sales figures during a 
survey earlier this year, spokeswoman Shelley Sapone said. 
</P>
<P>
 And safeguards are becoming more common. 
</P>
<P>
 An experimental variety of corn hand-planted on a sliver of Conejo Ranch is 
identified only by white sticks lining the rows. Several beds over, a yellow 
placard marking a tried-and-true variety notes only, "CORN No. 1." 
</P>
<P>
 Each marker corresponds to a file inside the Underwood Ranches office, which 
lists information about the seed, the fertilizer, the pesticides and other 
secrets. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't want to write it all down here (in the field) because our 
competition could come by," planting foreman Zavala explained. "If everyone 
knows, we have no chance to earn money." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, successful experimentation is crucial for Underwood Ranches' long-term 
survival.  
</P>
<P>
 The partners have banked their future on a strategy of innovation -- 
developing new products and getting them to market before anyone else catches 
wind. To that end, they spend roughly 25% of their profits each year on 
research and development. 
</P>
<P>
 "The key for us, as with all guerrilla operations, is to fight around the 
edges and be quick and nimble," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sometimes, they wind up with spectacular failures -- like the case of the 
poisoned potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Eager to develop a new super-sweet variety of potato, the partners planted a 
four-acre test crop back in 1992. They expected the potatoes to turn out tender 
and fresh, tasting of spring itself. 
</P>
<P>
 But, as Underwood sheepishly recalled, "We had a little glitch." 
</P>
<P>
 When the first harvest came in, Athanassiadis zapped a plateful of the 
potatoes in the office microwave and dug into a tasty lunch. Ten minutes later, 
he began to notice "a very definite sensation of being poisoned." 
</P>
<P>
 Somehow, he and an assistant, who also gobbled the potato lunch, managed to 
stay calm. The nasty feeling abated within 20 minutes. They recovered 
completely. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet they weren't too keen on that particular variety of potato. 
</P>
<P>
 The culprit, it later turned out, was a type of alkaloid -- a natural organic 
substance that also shows up, in various mutations, in caffeine, morphine and 
quinine. Found in tomato and rhubarb leaves and some potato skins, the 
colorless, crystalline substance can poison animals or humans. And it 
overpowered the other compounds in the tiny test potatoes. 
</P>
<P>
 Skittish about poisoning their customers, the partners had to chuck all four 
acres of the alkaloid-rich potatoes. They wrote off their $6,000 investment as 
a loss, then started all over again with a different variety. 
</P>
<P>
 The three harvested their second test crop this spring -- and sent the baby 
potatoes to a lab for chemical analysis before anyone dared try them. 
</P>
<P>
 Pronounced fit to eat, the potatoes are now being test-marketed at several 
local groceries. To help them plan beyond the potatoes, Underwood and his 
partners recently spent several thousand dollars to hire two strategists. 
</P>
<P>
 The first, Danilo Lopez, has three decades of experience in the produce 
industry. The other, Bill Knoke, has worked with high-tech firms for years, and 
knows more about aerospace than carrots. 
</P>
<P>
 The farmers have pestered their consultants with questions like: How much 
should the company grow? How can they speed up research and development? How 
can they encourage customer loyalty? 
</P>
<P>
 And, most basically: How can they thrive in such tumultuous times? 
</P>
<P>
 The consultants' suggestions have already prompted some changes. 
</P>
<P>
 On Lopez's advice, the farmers hired two new sales associates. They're also 
continuing to study ways to expand existing product lines. 
</P>
<P>
 But the grand strategies mean little in the day-to-day grind of this hectic 
spring planting season. Whether fighting off cutworms or fertilizing the soil, 
the farmers must plow through the daily tasks that nurture life on Conejo 
Ranch. ABOUT THIS SERIES 
</P>
<P>
 "60 Acres of Hope," a series that began in October, follows the first year of 
a Southern California farm. Three previous articles traced the field's first 
crop of gourmet salad greens from planting to harvest to market. This story 
looks at the field's second crop -- corn -- and explores the farmers' attempts 
to develop new products to compete in a crowded industry. Future stories will 
focus on a continuing battle with the U. S. Environmental Protection Agency and 
will evaluate the economics of the field's first year. Crop Pests 
</P>
<P>
 The corn planted at Conejo Ranch in March needs to be protected from a variety 
of pests during its short lifetime. Most varieties of corn take 78 to 95 days 
to mature, depending on the weather and soil conditions. From seed to stalk, 
corn is treated with fungicides and pesticides to safeguard it from predators. 
Fungus 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: Immediately after planting, a corn seed begins sucking moisture from 
the soil. The seed swells with water and then bursts, leaving its starchy 
endosperm exposed. A fungus may eat this carbohydrate-rich material and destroy 
the seed. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment: All seeds are coated with a fungicide and sometimes with an 
insecticide as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing: Applied before planting  
</P>
<P>
 A Mature Cron Seed: Fungus may attack the endosperm once a seed has burst. 
</P>
<P>
 The seed coat protects the endosperm and embryo. 
</P>
<P>
 The embryo develops into a new plant. Cutworm 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: Cutworms cut through corn stalks underground. They can even fell a 
plant that has grown up to six inches tall. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment: A granular insecticide is spread across the field. The insecticide 
trickles through a large funnel, which is pulled by a tractor along each bed. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing: As soon as the worms are spotted, usually within first month after 
planting. 
</P>
<P>
 Cutworm: (Shown curled up as it does during daylight hours) Earworms and 
Aphids 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: Just as the corn blossom, a moth lays eggs in the ear silk. When the 
eggs hatch, the worms crawl out and gnaw the corn. Aphids, which appear during 
earworm treatment, suck juices out of the corn. 
</P>
<P>
 Treatment: Insecticides are sprayed by helicopter or using tractors that ride 
above the corn, misting each ear. Aphids appear during treatment because 
spraying kills their predators. Amount of insecticide is increased to kill 
aphids. 
</P>
<P>
 Timing: Three to four treatments as the corn blossoms.

 For almost a month, they chain-sawed and crow-barred their way into the 
flattened walls of the Northridge Meadows Apartments, where 16 people died in 
the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 In a pathos-filled exercise in urban archeology conducted amid the litter of 
rotting food, crushed automobiles and scattered memorabilia, dozens of lawyers, 
engineers and city building specialists picked apart the rubble, seeking to 
learn why the three-story complex collapsed. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys representing former tenants and families of the deceased found what 
they allege to be design flaws and construction defects from the foundation to 
the roof of the 163-unit complex. Poorly secured stucco, missing shear walls, 
skimpy nailing, undersized connectors and materials substitutions showed a 
pattern of shoddy workmanship, they contend. 
</P>
<P>
 Although conceding the existence of some such defects, experts for the 
defendants downplayed their significance. They said the 25-year-old building 
met the standards of its time, and was largely a victim of geography, standing 
nearly above the epicenter amid a cluster of heavily damaged or destroyed 
apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a simple case, infuriatingly simple," said Seb Ficcadenti, engineer for 
Northridge Meadows' builder, Heller Construction. "A couple hundred yards 
around the site, five buildings with partial collapse." 
</P>
<P>
 Beyond the pretrial posturing, however, the board-by-board dismantling of 
Northridge Meadows -- conducted under court order and costing an estimated 
$500,000 -- produced some lessons that are widely accepted. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost is the inadequacy of building codes for two- and three-story wooden 
structures. The inspection showed that even today's standards, though tougher 
than those of 25 years ago, fail to provide the level of safety they should, 
Los Angeles building officials have concluded. 
</P>
<P>
 Secondly, the building that killed 16 people was not a lot different from 
other buildings that survived the Jan. 17 quake, suggesting that there could be 
a loss of life in future earthquakes. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was nothing different," said Nicolino Delli Quadri, chief of the 
Training & Emergency Management division of the Los Angeles Department of 
Building and Safety. "Typical construction for that time. There's nothing at 
this time that we found atypical." 
</P>
<P>
 The common ground is that the causes of the Northridge Meadows failure include 
inadequate seismic resistance built into the walls and over-reliance on 
structural elements that have been shown to provide less strength than was 
thought in 1970. Not only are such flaws endemic to buildings of that era, but, 
in some cases, today's code still allows them. 
</P>
<P>
 Delli Quadri, spokesman for the Department of Building and Safety's 
post-earthquake analysis team, is also a member of the committee examining wood 
frame construction. He said the group is preparing recommendations for further 
tightening of the code for new buildings and a program to strengthen older 
buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 If adopted, a retrofit program would require the owners of hundreds -- and 
possibly thousands -- of buildings of the early 1970s and before to remove 
gypsum board or similar outdated materials from critical walls and resurface 
them with stronger materials such as plywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of us in the building department had a high confidence in wood frame 
buildings," Delli Quadri said. Now, they are "looking back, asking questions 
about the buildings we approved in the past. How safe are they? They could be 
safer." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the final analysis of what made most of the first floor of Northridge 
Meadows collapse must await extensive calculations based on the data collected 
over the past month, several of the experts now agree on a rough explanation. 
</P>
<P>
 They say its design relied upon a medley of structural elements to work 
together in the building's shear-wall system of seismic resistance: stucco 
exterior walls, diagonal wood bracing, gypsum board interior walls, plywood 
walls and a partial steel frame. 
</P>
<P>
 But most of those building materials were inherently weaker than the strength 
ratings they were then given in the building code, and, reacting differently to 
the stresses, the weaker elements failed first, increasing pressure on the 
stronger ones, several of the experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The code allowed the architect to put in stucco, drywall, plywood," Delli 
Quadri said. "The stucco and drywall gave up. The rest of the load went into 
plywood panels. Overwhelmed, they failed." 
</P>
<P>
 As litigation progresses, the questions attorneys raise about Northridge 
Meadows will most likely focus narrowly on the building standards of 1970: Did 
the design satisfy the requirements of the code? Did the builder follow the 
design? 
</P>
<P>
 Joel Castro, the lead attorney in a tangle of lawsuits filed by several 
tenants and the families of dead tenants, asserted that the evidence 
resoundingly answers both questions no. 
</P>
<P>
 As his experts wrapped up their inspection late last month, Castro presented 
their findings as a catalogue of flaws. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're looking at what we consider some very substantial construction 
problems," Castro said. "And then the design -- it's just inadequate shear wall 
to support these loads." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the problems Castro alleged: 
</P>
<P>
 * Design of tuck-under parking. The architect designed the first floor to be 
divided between living area and parking, leaving the second and third floors 
suspended over long open spaces instead of rigid walls. In two sections, cars 
could be parked two deep, leaving more than half the first floor open, without 
the honeycomb support of the interior walls. Special plywood shear walls were 
supposed to add strength. They were inadequate, however, and failed. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use of steel frame in design. Plans called for a large steel I-beam to run 
lengthwise across the parking areas. One end rested on a heavy steel column, 
but the other end of the beam was spliced into a large wood beam. The other end 
of the wood beam rested on another steel column. In the earthquake, the wood 
beam broke away from the supporting steel column. Smaller pipe columns that 
supported the beam in the middle either bent or disconnected. Castro contends 
that the steel frame could have provided horizontal resistance to an 
earthquake, but wasn't designed properly. 
</P>
<P>
 * Installation of stucco. A thick layer of plaster laid over wire mesh, stucco 
provides a rigid exterior skin that resists distortion of a building's shape. 
At Northridge Meadows, large sections of stucco separated from the wooden frame 
when the staples holding the wire mesh to the framing pulled loose. 
Investigators found that in many cases, there were no staples along the top and 
bottom, the critical points. 
</P>
<P>
 * Installation of drywall. Gypsum drywall on interior walls helps to hold the 
building together. Because the chalk-like filling crumbles easily, nails must 
be driven at close intervals to provide cumulative strength. In hallways, 
required by code to have double thickness drywall, the lower layer was only 
tacked in place, rather than nailed thoroughly. No nails were placed along the 
top and bottom edges. Investigators found that many sheets of drywall were torn 
off the walls, leaving nails behind.  
</P>
<P>
 * Foundation attachments. The building code required bolts a minimum of every 
6 feet to secure the framing to the foundation. In spots, investigators found 
bolts spaced almost 10 feet apart. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, brackets designed to secure walls to the foundation at corners, 
which were not necessarily required by code, were not used or specified in the 
design, investigators found. 
</P>
<P>
 * Framing. In places, only minimal nailing was used to attach floors to walls, 
allowing the joint to give. The joints could have been strengthened with short 
2-by-4s, called horizontal shear blocking, nailed into both parts.  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Castro's team also identified several deviations from the 
architect's plan, such as wood planking substituted for plywood, the use of 
smaller metal hangers, the absence of plywood in some walls, and structural 
breaks caused by an elevation change in the foundation.  
</P>
<P>
 In interviews, engineers representing defendants in the lawsuit rebutted 
Castro's assertions one by one, either minimizing the effect of the alleged 
deficiency or justifying it as an accepted practice of the time. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, they pointed out, the code did not require drywall to be nailed 
on top and bottom. The building code also allowed the wall-to-floor joint to be 
secured by nailing only, without the short 2-by-4 block Castro said should have 
been used. 
</P>
<P>
 Code revisions since 1970 have increased the maximum seismic forces that 
engineers must take into account and reduced the seismic capacities of stucco, 
drywall and plywood walls. Diagonal bracing, one of the main lateral stiffening 
methods in the complex, was judged after the 1971 Sylmar earthquake to be of 
little seismic value and is no longer allowed in calculations of seismic 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 The current code also prohibits the practice of mixing different types of 
rigid material in a shear wall. Thus, walls at Northridge Meadows that relied 
on stucco, diagonal bracing, plywood and steel together to meet seismic 
requirements would be considered to have significantly less seismic resistance 
under current code. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, experts for the defendants said, the code in force in 1970 made no 
distinction between plywood or diagonal planks for floor sheathing and did not 
specify which joist hangers should be used. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Grinell, a contractor and architect hired by the attorneys for building 
owner Shashikant J. Jogani, contended that the floor joists -- as well as the 
I-beam splice -- separated under the weight of the falling building rather than 
from the shaking of the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Some questions about the construction of Northridge Meadows remain because 
neither its architect, Morris Brown, nor its engineer, David Weiss, have spoken 
publicly about it. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's attorney, Jay Sherman, said he had only been retained last week (5/and 
could not make detailed comments. He said the design complied entirely with the 
code then in force. Sherman said the structural engineer, not Brown, was 
responsible for the building's ability to withstand the earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 Weiss has not produced his calculations, and attorneys for both sides said 
they don't expect to obtain them. Neither Weiss nor his attorney returned calls 
from The Times. 
</P>
<P>
 Without the original calculations, observers can only speculate how the 
engineer intended the building would resist seismic forces. 
</P>
<P>
 But the tuck-under parking, which leaves one side of the building with no 
lateral strength, has emerged as a concept that all agree posed special 
problems. Ficcadenti said he believes the engineer came up with the steel beam 
system, embedded in a reinforced concrete footing to make up for the lack of 
interior and exterior walls. Thus, one side of the building relied on steel for 
its rigidity, and the other on conventional wood and plaster. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earthquake, the different materials reacted differently under stress, 
causing the weaker elements to fail first. Ficcadenti said the understanding of 
the dangers of this phenomenon, called "vertical stiffness differential," were 
derived from the experience of the 1971 earthquake. Since then, the code has 
been changed to require shear walls to be made of only one material. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent experts have also focused on tuck-under parking -- prevalent in 
apartment designs of the 1970s -- as a significant problem. 
</P>
<P>
 "I guess we all have come to the same conclusion," said Helmut Krawinkler, 
co-director of the John A. Blume Earthquake Engineering Center at Stanford 
University. "In all those practices where the first floor is wide open because 
of tuck-under parking . . . it is really no surprise that those soft stories 
collapse. 
</P>
<P>
 "In other buildings I looked at, the entire first floor was carport. People 
didn't get crushed. In Northridge Meadows, part (was) parking and part 
apartments. It was that mixture that caused the casualties." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Northridge Meadows may not have been unique in its failings, the 
tragedy of its 16 deaths may help the city take steps more swiftly and 
decisively than after the 1971 quake, when the major alarm was raised over 
unreinforced masonry buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 After examining dozens of apartment buildings damaged or destroyed Jan. 17, 
Los Angeles city building officials are preparing recommendations for a major 
revision of the code covering two- and three-story wood construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the revisions Delli Quadri said the department is considering: 
</P>
<P>
 * Downgrading the strength rating given to stucco, drywall and plywood walls 
in seismic calculations. 
</P>
<P>
 * Prohibiting the use of staples to secure stucco. 
</P>
<P>
 * Requiring the manufacturers of connecting and fastening devices to subject 
them to cyclical testing, which measures performance under repeated stress, 
rather than the static testing currently done. 
</P>
<P>
 * Require all framing on first floors of three-story wood buildings to be made 
of boards three inches thick instead of the 2-by-4s or 2-by-6s that are 
currently standard. Often, the nails holding plywood sheathing to the framing 
merely pulled out when the studs split, Delli Quadri said. 
</P>
<P>
 But all the proposals, he anticipates, will run into opposition from some 
builders and apartment owners who don't want the added expense and 
complication. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to run into all kinds of hell to change it," he said. "They don't 
like to do it." The Search for Answers 
</P>
<P>
 Identifying Possible Causes of the Northridge Meadows Collapse 
</P>
<P>
 Before the Northridge Meadows Apartments could be completely razed, they were 
partially dismantled floor by floor in an attempt to determine why the building 
partially collapsed during the Northridge earthquake. All 16 people who died 
were on the first floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of people were involved in the gathering of evidence, including city 
building and safety personnel, structural engineers and attorneys for the 
building owner, tenants and families of the deceased. Attorneys will use pieces 
of the structure as evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 During the controlled demolition that began last month, lawyers for survivors 
have identified a number of what they believe to be design flaws and 
construction defects. Attorneys for the owner and builder downplay the 
importance of such fault, which they contend can be found in all buildings of 
the time. They said the building met the code in force in 1970, when the 
building was designed, and that the code was deficient. Some of the disputed 
points are shown. Basic Structural Components 
</P>
<P>
 These are structural components common to all buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Connections: Nails, blocking and joints. 
</P>
<P>
 Distributing elements: Roof and floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Foundation 
</P>
<P>
 Resisting elements: Walls, columns and bracing. 
</P>
<P>
 The distributing element of a building are those that lie horizontally. They 
tie the walls together and disperse the static weight of furnishings and 
occupants. 
</P>
<P>
 The resisting elements are the vertical components. They support and transfer 
the load of the distributing elements to the foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation supports and ties together the walls and transfers the weight 
of the building to the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 The connections tie all of the above elements together. The Walls 
</P>
<P>
 The structure shown below is a composite of several areas of the Northridge 
Meadows complex and is not a depiction of an actual room. 
</P>
<P>
 Joist Hangers 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: Steel brackets, used to secure the floor joists to the sill, were 
smaller than specified in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Effect: Floor joists popped out of the joist hangers, even though the code 
allowed smaller brackets. 
</P>
<P>
 Plank Flooring 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: The builder substituted diagonal planks for the plywood floor 
sheathing specified in the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Effect: Floors may have been less rigid than the builder intended, although 
the code treated the two materials the same. 
</P>
<P>
 Stucco 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: With the wire mesh attached directly to the paper behind it, there 
was inadequate bond between the wire and the stucco. 
</P>
<P>
 Effect: The stucco could break away from the wire, losing its strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Interior Wall Bracing 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: Several interior walls that were subjected to great side-to-side 
forces were braced only with gypsum board, which has less strength than 
previously believed. 
</P>
<P>
 Effect: Walls lacked lateral rigidity. 
</P>
<P>
 Diagonal Wall Bracing 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: Diagonal bracing used as a primary means of providing lateral 
rigidity has been shown to provide minimal strength to walls. Plywood would 
have provided more strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Effect: Braces broke or separated, allowing wall to deform. 
</P>
<P>
 Stucco 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: The wire mesh, which strengthens the stucco, was not stapled to the 
sill and top plate. 
</P>
<P>
 Effect: "Waves" may have occurred in the stucco as they would when shaking a 
rug, causing the stucco to pull away and crack. Stucco is important to a 
building's seismic resistance. The Foundation 
</P>
<P>
 Anchor Bolts 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: Too few anchor bolts were used to secure some walls to the 
foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 Effect: A large section of wall was ripped from the foundation. The Floor 
</P>
<P>
 Wall/Floor Connections 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: To compensate for a step in the foundation, a two-by-four was turned 
on end to fill the space, but was not nailed to the floor. 
</P>
<P>
 Effect: The wall was able to shift laterally as shown by the arrow. 
Truck-Under Parking 
</P>
<P>
 interior Garage Walls 
</P>
<P>
 Problem: Interior garage walls that ran parallel to the garage entrance were 
sheathed in plaster. City building officials are recommending retrofitting of 
such walls with plywood sheathing. 
</P>
<P>
 Effect: These walls had very low side-to-side rigidity and in many cases 
collapsed.

GUNSHOTS AGAIN RAKE VENICE; 2 YOUTHS DIE; VIOLENCE: SLAIN TEEN-AGERS WERE NOT 
BELIEVED TO BE GANG MEMBERS. BUT POLICE SAY THEY MAY HAVE BEEN TARGETED AS 
LATINOS IN A GANG WAR THAT HAS PITTED THEIR ETHNIC GROUP AGAINST BLACKS.

<P>
 Two teen-agers were killed and two others were wounded Friday morning when 
gunmen in a van opened fire in the Venice area -- yet another bloody episode in 
a community where a war between black and Latino gangs has claimed about 15 
lives over the past year. 
</P>
<P>
 Though police did not know the motive for the attack, the case was turned over 
to anti-gang investigators who have been tracking the gang war. The victims -- 
none of whom were believed to be gang members -- are Latino. The three suspects 
-- who police said fired at least five shots into the car using weapons that 
included a shotgun and handgun -- were described as blacks. 
</P>
<P>
 All four victims were students at Dorsey High School, according to police and 
school officials. The dead were identified as Jose Tizcareno, 18, of Venice and 
Jose Alvarez, 17, of the Mid-Wilshire area. Rafael Campoy, 17, and Javier 
Lopez, 18, both of the Mid-Wilshire area, suffered minor gunshot wounds to the 
arms, shoulder and face. They were treated at Daniel Freeman Marina Hospital 
and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Tizcareno, who lived near the spot where he died, was described by Dorsey 
officials as a bright and promising student who was popular among his 
classmates. He was to graduate Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 His sister, 15-year-old Mayra Tizcareno, stared at the blood-streaked scene on 
Venice Boulevard and sobbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They killed my brother. He wasn't even a cholo . He never even dressed like a 
gang member," she said. "He had a job, had everything. He was doing something 
good." 
</P>
<P>
 The attack took place a block from Venice High School, but the school remained 
open. The neighborhood around the school has been the site of past shootings 
and side streets are barricaded during school hours to prevent drive-by 
attacks. Police said Friday night that about 100 extra officers will be 
patrolling Venice-area streets this weekend as a result of the rash of 
violence. 
</P>
<P>
 They said the four victims were in their car after shopping at a pager store 
on Venice Boulevard when several gunmen pulled up in a van and opened fire. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses ran out to discover a grisly scene. On the street near a red Hyundai 
with its rear windows shot out, the driver was on his back, lying dead in a 
pool of blood. The passenger who was killed sat seat-belted in the back of the 
car. The other two passengers, also sitting in the car, "looked stunned," said 
Richard Simonian, one of the first people on the scene. 
</P>
<P>
 Police were investigating whether the shootings might have been retaliation 
for an incident hours earlier in which a black man was wounded in Venice's 
Oakwood neighborhood during a drive-by attack carried out by gunmen described 
as Latinos. They are also investigating whether the attack might have been 
intended to avenge the killing of a black gang member from the Wilshire area 
whose funeral was held earlier Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 About six hours after the attack, the van believed to have been used by the 
assailants was found on a street in the Oakwood area, said Police Sgt. Bruce 
Berg. "It was not a stolen vehicle and it is being checked for fingerprints and 
other leads," he said Friday night. 
</P>
<P>
 Increasingly, victims of the Venice violence have been unconnected to gangs, 
feeding speculation that they have been targeted because of their race or 
ethnicity. 
</P>
<P>
 The shootings Friday came only three days after six people were injured when 
gunmen in a truck sprayed a high school graduation party near Venice's Penmar 
Recreation Center. None of the victims in that attack were gang members but 
police and others said they may have been randomly chosen in the back-and-forth 
gang war, which has been centered mainly in the Oakwood neighborhood half a 
mile away. 
</P>
<P>
 Four victims in that attack were Latino. The three masked attackers were 
described as black men. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been tit for tat -- the blacks shooting Hispanics, shooting blacks, 
shooting Hispanics," said Lt. Otis Dobine, who commands detectives in the 
Pacific division of the Los Angeles Police Department. He said the victims in 
Friday's fatal incident "might have (been) mistaken for gang members." 
</P>
<P>
 The wearying violence has left fearful Venice residents feeling besieged and 
has disrupted normal life. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's been real hot around here for the past six to eight months," said a 
teen-ager who declined to give his name. "You've got to watch your back all the 
time. I can't even drive down Lincoln Boulevard anymore. If you get stuck at a 
red light, you're history. These guys don't ask any questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Inside a holistic health clinic, several chalk circles marked the carpet where 
stray bullet fragments from the shooting near the school landed Friday. 
Therapist Bill Domke was inside when one bullet crashed through the clinic's 
front window and others shattered the base of the front door. "It's just time 
to stop this senseless killing," he said.

CITYSCAPES / BOB POOL: LOST DOLLS TELL STORY OF ONE MAN'S BRIDGE ACROSS 
CULTURAL GAP; 'WHY RIVERSIDE? WHY DID MR. MILLER GET THEM? THOSE WERE THE BIG 
QUESTIONS.'

 They were the tiniest diplomats the world had ever seen. 
</P>
<P>
 They had names like Doris, Alice, Ehime and Kagawa and they crossed the 
Pacific 67 years ago to help tear down barriers between the United States and 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 They were children's dolls -- among 12,797 that were part of the most unusual 
cultural exchanges ever staged between the East and West. 
</P>
<P>
 Blue-eyed, gingham-clad figures were sent by Americans to schools throughout 
Japan. Black-haired, kimono-wrapped creations were sent by Japanese to towns 
across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 The doll swap was engineered in 1927 by an American-born educator searching 
for a way to improve sagging relations between the two countries. 
</P>
<P>
 These days, a Japanese-born real estate agent is searching for two of the 
"Friendship Dolls" in hopes of doing much the same thing. 
</P>
<P>
 Seiji Horita, 53, of Temple City, has spent nearly a year hunting for kimono 
dolls named "Miss Chiba" and "Miss Fusa" that were sent to Riverside in 1928 
but have since disappeared. 
</P>
<P>
 Horita, who sells houses in Alhambra, figures the dolls will help tell the 
story of how a man named Frank Miller stood up for the rights of immigrants to 
own homes in California. 
</P>
<P>
 The missing dolls have already taught Horita plenty about Miller, he says. 
</P>
<P>
 As a child growing up in Japan, Horita was familiar with the legend of the 
Blue-Eyed Dolls as memorialized in school books and in popular children's 
songs. But he didn't learn about the other half of the swap -- the kimono dolls 
-- until after he moved here in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 A chance encounter with a Japanese university professor visiting Los Angeles 
to research the Japanese dolls triggered Horita's own search. 
</P>
<P>
 Horita learned that the Japanese handcrafted 58 elaborate dolls -- one 
representing each regional prefecture and large city -- as their part of the 
swap. The 3-foot-tall figures ended up in American museums, mostly in large 
cities like New York, Los Angeles and San Francisco -- where single dolls were 
sent. 
</P>
<P>
 "But for some reason, two of them went to Riverside," Horita said. "To Frank 
Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 That was perplexing to Horita. The Riverside of the 1920s was a dusty 
agricultural and railroad town, hardly a cosmopolitan metropolis. And just who 
was this Frank Miller, anyhow? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "Why Riverside? Why did Mr. Miller get them?" he said. "Those were the big 
questions." 
</P>
<P>
 Months of poring over old newspaper records and talking with historians in 
Riverside -- where Miller built what is now known as the historic Mission Inn 
-- provided the answers.

 Horita traced Miller and his ties to Japanese immigrants to 1901. He learned 
that Miller had helped start a church for local Japanese, helped launch a 
Japanese civic association and been host of frequent bashes at his hotel for 
such occasions as the Japanese emperor's birthday. In the 1920s he helped 
organize a national relief effort that raised $12 million for food, medical 
supplies, tents and blankets after a disastrous earthquake in Japan. 
</P>
<P>
 But more importantly, Miller fought proposals in 1913 and 1920 to prohibit 
immigrants from owning land in California. 
</P>
<P>
 His was a public fight: Miller took out large ads in The Times labeled "Our 
Stand" and "Think Again" that urged voters to reject the proposed law. When it 
was enacted anyway and a Japanese immigrant named Jukichi Harada tested it by 
buying a house in his American-born children's name, Miller offered to purchase 
the residence for Harada. Eventually, though, the law was overturned. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese did not forget that kindness a few years later when the doll swap 
occurred. 
</P>
<P>
 The American doll-collecting was started by Sydney Gulick, a missionary and 
educator from the East Coast who had lived in Japan. Drawing from schools, PTAs 
and other groups across the country, Gulick raised enough money to buy 12,739 
American factory-made dolls. Each was dressed in custom-made clothes and given 
a make-believe passport in its own name. 
</P>
<P>
 The Japanese responded by producing the 58 fancy kimono dolls. They toured 479 
U.S. towns before being distributed to museums in this country's largest 
cities.  
</P>
<P>
 The chosen sites, including Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago and New York, 
each got one. Except Riverside, where Frank Miller got two. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Historian Mark Rawitsch of Willits, Calif., author of a 1983 book about early 
Japanese immigrants in Riverside, said Miller's forthright stance against the 
land-ownership ban elevated him in the eyes of Japanese leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm absolutely certain that's why he got the two Friendship Dolls," Rawitsch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the American-made dolls were destroyed in the anti-U.S. frenzy that 
swept Japan during World War II. The kimono dolls, meanwhile, were tucked out 
of sight in U.S. museums. A Japanese researcher found "Miss Taiwan" -- the doll 
sent to Los Angeles -- in the Los Angeles County Museum of Natural History in 
1988. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were quite excited to discover that one of them is still in the museum," 
said Beth Werling, a museum collections manager who puts it on periodic 
display. "The Friendship Dolls are very important culturally to the Japanese. 
It's a sign of respect for them to come and visit the doll and pay their 
respects to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller died in the mid-1930s, meriting a front-page editorial in The Times 
praising his efforts "to further the cause of better international relations." 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not sure what happened to 'Miss Chiba' and 'Miss Fusa,' " said Kevin 
Hallaran, current curator of the Mission Inn Museum. "When the hotel was sold, 
my guess is they went with the Miller granddaughters in 1956." 
</P>
<P>
 Those women have since died. "We've not been able to track down their heirs," 
Hallaran said. 
</P>
<P>
 Horita is convinced the missing dolls are still somewhere in Southern 
California. If they can be found, he hopes to have them displayed -- perhaps at 
the Japanese American Cultural and Community Center in Los Angeles' Little 
Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
 They would be a popular attraction for Japanese tourists, Horita is convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will be big news all over Japan," he said.

OFFICIALS, NFL HUDDLE ON REPAIRS TO COLISEUM; STADIUM: FOOTBALL COMMISSIONER 
AND RAIDERS REPRESENTATIVE ARE ASSURED THAT QUAKE-DAMAGED FACILITY WILL BE 
READY FOR FALL SEASON. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 With work beginning at last on repairing the historic peristyle at the 
earthquake-damaged Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum, high-ranking Coliseum 
officials met Friday with the commissioner of the National Football League and 
a representative of the Raiders to assure them the stadium will be ready for 
football in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The president of the Coliseum Commission, Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne 
Brathwaite Burke and the repair project director, Don C. Webb, sought to 
persuade NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue, NFL attorney Frank Rothman and 
Raiders attorney Amy Trask that the repair is proceeding so well that the team 
need not move to Oakland or anyplace else. 
</P>
<P>
 "We told them the stadium would be ready, the full stadium, not just 50,000 
seats, but the normal Raider seating capacity of 68,000," Burke said after the 
conclusion of the meeting in her office. 
</P>
<P>
 Trask later expressed some satisfaction with the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm guardedly optimistic about our situation," the team's attorney said. "It 
is apparent that the NFL, (Los Angeles) Mayor (Richard Riordan) and Supervisor 
Burke agree with the Raiders that this community deserves a state-of-the-art 
facility which places it at least on a par with communities throughout the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 "That state-of-the-art facility can be the centerpiece of a cleaned-up and 
vibrant Exposition Park neighborhood," she added. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Burke reported no commitments on the part of either Tagliabue or Trask that 
the Raiders -- who have yet to send out season ticket applications -- would 
remain at the Coliseum. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Tagliabue listened, and he asked us questions about the progress," Burke 
said. "He didn't question that we were serious. His (staff) people have gone 
through and reviewed the ongoing work. Amy Trask said she hoped we could 
starting talking about unifying the city, with all its racial and ethnic 
groups, behind the team." 
</P>
<P>
 Tagliabue could not be reached Friday for comment on the talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb, in an interview earlier in the day outlining the progress of the 
$42-million repair at the stadium, said he felt the Raiders have to decide 
whether to send out the season ticket applications no later than June 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Reporting that team officials have visited the Coliseum to see how the work is 
proceeding, Webb said he believes that the team's managing general partner, Al 
Davis, views sending out the applications as the key decision about playing in 
the stadium this fall. 
</P>
<P>
 But, he added, the Raiders have expressed concerns that even if the repair is 
mostly complete, the public may still feel that the stadium has safety 
problems. Webb said he is confident there will not be safety problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Raider representatives have also said they fear that some concession booths 
may not be ready and that concession income, as well as attendance at Raider 
games, could go down, Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, they remain determined to get commitments from the Coliseum 
Commission for long-term improvements at the Coliseum, including the 
construction of luxury boxes, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, if the Raiders went to Oakland, the team could make more money in 
the short term, but it would probably never come back to Los Angeles, and it 
would not fare as well financially in the long term, Webb asserted. 
</P>
<P>
 Burke said Tagliabue had told her the NFL is interested in seeing inner-city 
stadiums, such as the Coliseum, "brought up to the standard of other stadiums," 
presumably with luxury boxes. 
</P>
<P>
 "We assured them that that was our goal," Burke said. "I explained to everyone 
there that we have always had a plan, first to lower the field, which we have 
done, then to build new concession booths and then to building the boxes. There 
has never been any question in our mind that would be done." 
</P>
<P>
 But, Webb said Friday, formal negotiations with the Raiders, looking forward 
for a long-term contract for the team to play at the Coliseum and a commission 
commitment to secure a loan to build the boxes, have not yet begun. 
</P>
<P>
 During a tour he conducted of the Coliseum, the project director said a labor 
force of 600 is working on shifts around the clock on repairing the facility. 
He expressed confidence that even the elaborate peristyle repairs will be 
finished by the first scheduled game, between USC and Washington, Sept. 3. The 
Raiders' home opener is Sept. 11. 
</P>
<P>
 In the peristyle, 12-inch core holes are being drilled down the middle of 24 
existing columns, which will then be refilled with steel and high-strength 
concrete, Webb said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another part of the peristyle strengthening will be the installation of four 
shear walls to further secure the central arch, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 While peristyle work is under way, Webb said no final decision has been made 
about what to do with the earthquake-battered press box. 
</P>
<P>
 Webb left no doubt that he feels it should be demolished. He expressed hope 
this could be done, and temporary press seating provided, before September, 
with a new press box built later. In any event, Webb said, the press box, as 
is, can never be used again. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the Coliseum looked quite torn up, with huge drilling equipment 
still at work in the upper concourse level, drilling the piles to anchor the 
stadium superstructure to the earth below, scores of workers pouring concrete 
in already completed areas, and scores of others working on replacing thousands 
of damaged seats. 
</P>
<P>
 But Webb said the essential parts of the work to reopen the stadium will be 
complete within 85 days.

NORTH-SOUTH SPAT IMPERILS MUSEUM PLAN; LEGISLATURE: PANEL BLOCKS FUNDS TO BUILD 
A NEW SCIENCE SHOWCASE IN L.A. SOME SAY THE MONEY IS MEANT FOR LOMA PRIETA 
QUAKE VICTIMS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Until two weeks ago, the construction of a new $45-million Museum of Science 
and Industry in Los Angeles seemed an absolute certainty. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before the war between North and South broke out in the state 
Legislature. 
</P>
<P>
 That was before questions were raised about why money earmarked for earthquake 
repairs after Northern California's Loma Prieta quake was being used to build a 
new structure. (And in Los Angeles, no less, the place known to much of 
Northern California as the predatory metropolis to the south that steals 
football teams and other valuable assets.) 
</P>
<P>
 That was before legislators who had voted for the museum in 1992 suddenly 
balked last month at appropriating the money to build it. 
</P>
<P>
 And the drama is still unfolding, as state legislators in Sacramento wrestle 
with the subject in budget hearings. A decision is expected as early as next 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 The stakes in this fight are high. The museum is seen as an important cog in 
the redevelopment of the Exposition Park area, home of the Coliseum. Local 
legislators talk of the jobs the project will create and then about how 
stalling on the money question seems vindictive on the part of Northern 
California politicians. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely a North-South question," said Assemblywoman Marguerite 
Archie-Hudson (D-Los Angeles), one of the key backers of the project. "We've 
answered everything over and over and over again. I don't understand why the 
questions keep cropping up, and it's getting to be very frustrating." 
</P>
<P>
 The legislators from the North counter by suggesting there is a bit of 
chicanery in the wind here, that money designated for one use is being spent on 
another. 
</P>
<P>
 "What California citizens voted for was to protect themselves from entering 
buildings which would be unsafe during earthquakes; they voted against being in 
deathtraps. But most emphatically, they did not vote to misuse money to raze a 
historic museum simply so that a new and larger one could be constructed in its 
place," said Sen. Nicholas Petris (D-Oakland). 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy over the construction of the museum -- plans for which have 
been in the works for four years -- began May 25, when state Sen. Quentin Kopp 
(I-San Francisco) persuaded a Senate budget committee to rescind all $45 
million earmarked for the project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In doing so, he pointed out that the money for the museum was coming from a 
$300-million pot approved by voters in the wake of the 1989 Loma Prieta 
earthquake. He contended that money obviously intended for earthquake repair in 
Northern California should not be used to build a new museum in Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
 A particular sore point: The $45 million was the largest single appropriation 
from the fund. 
</P>
<P>
 Museum Director Jeffrey Rudolph defends using the money for a new museum. It 
may be in Southern California, but he said the project meets all the 
requirements of the law. Rudolph said he had been so confident of the budget 
committee's approval that no one from his staff had even attended the budget 
session that day. He learned what had happened when a supporter in Sacramento 
called later in the day and said, "Guess what?" 
</P>
<P>
 "We really weren't prepared for it," he said. "While some concerns had been 
expressed in other hearings, we thought we had answered the concerns of the 
senators." 
</P>
<P>
 The controversy surrounding the museum centers on two buildings that have been 
closed to the public since 1990 -- the Ahmanson Building and the Armory, both 
more than 80 years old. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1987, the Legislature authorized the preparation of a master plan for 
Exposition Park, where the Museum of Science and Industry is. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1990, as part of the plan's preparation, architects examined both buildings 
and concluded that they would be unsafe in an earthquake. Further, they said 
that because more than 1,000 children visited the museum each day, the risk of 
keeping the buildings open was heightened. So, in June, 1990, both buildings 
were closed to the public, though the staff still has its offices in the 
armory. 
</P>
<P>
 Four months after the closure, voters passed the 1990 Earthquake Safety and 
Public Building Rehabilitation Bond Act. The act was in response to the Loma 
Prieta earthquake. It was designed, in part, to repair several severely damaged 
state buildings in Oakland and San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 But the act did not specify a designated geographical area. And it also said 
the money could be used to either repair or replace buildings that were unsafe 
in an earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In their quest for funds to replace the closed buildings, museum officials 
began looking for what sources might be available. They hit upon funds from the 
bond issue. Even if such use was unintended, the view from Los Angeles was that 
the wording of the law perfectly described the museum's status. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1992, state Sen. Teresa Hughes (D-Inglewood) introduced legislation calling 
for the replacement of the museum and asked that the funding source be the 
building rehabilitation bond act. The bill sailed through both the House and 
Senate. Among those voting for it were Kopp and Petris. 
</P>
<P>
 Petris said he did not believe at the time that the plan was to raze the two 
buildings. He said he thought the idea was to restore them. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't thinking about having two historical buildings torn down," he said. 
"The proponents are interpreting it as knocking down buildings and building new 
ones. I personally think it's a bad idea to destroy those two buildings." 
</P>
<P>
 Rudolph, the museum's executive director, said bids for the demolition of the 
two buildings were to be opened later this month. He said the plans, which were 
approved by such groups as the Los Angeles Conservancy, had been a matter of 
public scrutiny for years. "It wasn't snuck through," he said of the bill 
authorizing the new museum. "It was not a last-minute amendment to get the 
money." 
</P>
<P>
 State Sen. Diane Watson (D-Los Angeles), another proponent of the museum, said 
she understood much was now being made of tearing down two historic buildings. 
But she called it a specious argument because of conservation organizations 
having signed off on the project. 
</P>
<P>
 "I hear there is some concern that Los Angeles is taking the lion's share of 
money that we don't deserve," she said. "I think it's retaliation for the 
Raiders and other personal gripes."

CARJACK VICTIM LEAPS TO SAFETY; ESCAPE: CHATSWORTH MAN ESCAPES GUNMEN BY 
JUMPING OUT OF HIS CAR AT 30 M.P.H. ALONG MOUNTAIN ROAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 For Jim Voshall, who usually deals with crime from a comfortable distance as a 
security company telephone operator, it was a shock to have terror climb into 
his passenger seat. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after two men forced their way into his car at gunpoint he found 
himself on his knees, tearfully begging for his life. 
</P>
<P>
 And shortly after that, he hurled himself from his own car at 30 m.p.h. on a 
mountain road, bailing out in a desperate attempt to escape the gunmen who had 
decided not to kill him "yet." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Friday at the offices of Westec Security in Santa Monica where 
he works, Voshall, 26, recounted his capture by the gunmen as he left the 
office about 10:45 p.m. Thursday after a long shift, thinking about his 
girlfriend and his 2-year-old son at home in Chatsworth. 
</P>
<P>
 Through the open car window at a stoplight, a man thrust a pistol into his 
neck and ordered him to open the passenger door for an accomplice, then got 
into the rear seat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Just drive," they told him. "Just drive," directing him east on the Santa 
Monica Freeway, north on the Golden State to the Ventura Freeway, and west to 
Topanga Canyon Boulevard. 
</P>
<P>
 Numb, shaking and staring straight ahead, Voshall followed their instructions 
to head south through the Santa Monica Mountains. There was almost no talk. 
Appearing lost and irritated when they reached Pacific Coast Highway, he said, 
the gunman ordered him to turn back into the mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 Two miles in, the man with the gun told Voshall to stop. Seeing nowhere to 
pull off, Voshall put his Honda Accord into park in the middle of the road. 
</P>
<P>
 "They said, 'This is where you get out,' " Voshall recalled.  
</P>
<P>
 The man with the gun ordered him to walk in front of the car. Then he told 
Voshall to get down on his knees. 
</P>
<P>
 The gunman put the pistol's muzzle between Voshall's eyes. "I think we should 
kill (him)," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Voshall began to cry, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 " 'Please don't kill me,' " he begged them. "I said, 'I have a wife and a kid 
at home, I have a family. I'm too young to die.' " 
</P>
<P>
 "Death, that's all that went through my mind," Voshall said. "I was going to 
die and my son was going to grow up without a dad . . . A life doesn't mean 
anything to them." 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back on it, Voshall said his pleas might have had an affect on the 
gunman's associate. "No," the accomplice told the gunman. "Let's not kill him 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 The accomplice dragged the 5-foot 8-inch Voshall up by his shirt collar and 
shoved him into the passenger seat. The gunman returned to the back seat and 
the accomplice drove north on Topanga. 
</P>
<P>
 "The word that stuck in my mind was yet ," Voshall said. "He said, "Let's not 
kill him yet. I didn't want to wait for the yet. " 
</P>
<P>
 Voshall planned an escape. He jammed his elbow into the automatic door lock 
button and inched it up, watching the dashboard for the moment the "door ajar" 
warning light would flash on. 
</P>
<P>
 Just past the high point of Topanga Boulevard, Voshall got his chance. When 
the driver slowed to about 30 m.p.h., Voshall punched up the lock control, 
elbowed the door open and pitched forward out the opening, slamming into the 
pavement and rolling onto the dirt shoulder.  
</P>
<P>
 The car sped away, he said. From the safety of the hillside brush in the dark, 
he watched its headlights move off through the canyon before he climbed back up 
to the street and searched for help. 
</P>
<P>
 As he walked down the center of the unlit highway, Voshall thought about how 
the Valley had changed since his days as a student at Canoga Park High School. 
He thought about how lucky he was, he said, and he thought about his son. 
</P>
<P>
 A short way away, after trying unsuccessfully to flag down some passing cars, 
he came across a highway patrol officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Monica Police said Friday they had found neither the men nor the white 
car, license plate "SO CLEAN," named for the car detailing business that 
Voshall used to own. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes me want to move out of California," Voshall said, rubbing the sore 
right elbow that with some bruises were his only injuries in the jump. "I love 
California, but I also love living." 
</P>
<P>
 Of criminals like his captors, he said: "We need to get rid of them, send them 
out of California and take California back."

ONLY 460 SHOW UP TO TAKE CLAS TEST IN ANTELOPE VALLEY; EDUCATION: MOST OF THE 
3,000 SOPHOMORES CHOSE NOT TO DO DISPUTED EXAM BECAUSE IT CONFLICTED WITH 
FINALS.

<P>
 The Antelope Valley Union High School District, ordered by a judge to give its 
students the controversial California Learning Assessment System test, offered 
it Friday but only 460 of 3,000 sophomores chose to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 While conservative ideological views drove a majority of the district's board 
in their unsuccessful effort to prevent the test from being given, most 
students decided not to take it because it conflicted with final exams. 
</P>
<P>
 The test was given on the last day of classes before the official start of 
finals, which begin Monday and continue through the final day of school on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have a French final in first period, a 100-point presentation in math and 
have to do a dissection in biology -- a frog," said Karina Andrade, a student 
at Antelope Valley High who said she had wanted to take the assessment test but 
could not afford to miss her classes Friday. "It should have been given before 
this time of year." 
</P>
<P>
 She added, "My parents don't disagree with it or anything." 
</P>
<P>
 Students who took the CLAS test said they were motivated by a variety of 
reasons, with many saying they were unhappy the school board prevented them 
from taking it earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 Evan Brown said he was taking the test to "see what all the big fuss is about, 
why everybody is so scared of this thing." 
</P>
<P>
 Supporters of the test have praised it as a revolutionary method of measuring 
students' critical thinking skills, while opponents have said it asks 
inappropriate questions, fails to test basic skills and includes literature 
that promotes racism and denigrates the family. 
</P>
<P>
 Board President Billy Pricer, along with members Sue Stokka and Tony Welch, 
questioned the veil of secrecy surrounding the test, said it contained 
questions that violated privacy rights of students and their parents and 
contained reading passages that challenge morals. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley district administered the CLAS test only after being 
ordered twice to do so in the past week by Los Angeles Superior Court Judge 
Diane Wayne. 
</P>
<P>
 After taking it, students at Highland High School said Friday afternoon they 
were not sure why the test has become so embroiled in controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not that big of a deal," said Travis Fox. "It's not all that they made 
it out to be with the racial and ethnic things." 
</P>
<P>
 What Travis said the test does do is "make you think. I think they're just 
asking you to think." 
</P>
<P>
 Abby Buffalo agreed. "They made a really big deal out of nothing. Nothing that 
I read in there is offensive." 
</P>
<P>
 Her only complaints about CLAS: "It's long, it's boring and we had to sit on 
bleachers (to take it)." 
</P>
<P>
 Just how many students in the Antelope Valley district avoided the test 
because of their concerns or those of their parents about the exam's contents 
is unknown. Principals at the district's six schools did not ask students the 
reasons why they were not taking the test and, for the most part, none were 
given. 
</P>
<P>
 At the district's most populous high school, just 49 of 650 10th-graders took 
the exam. At the district's continuation school, which has 60 students in the 
10th grade, teachers didn't even open the sealed box of tests. Despite being 
offered free soda and candy, not a single student at the school chose to take 
CLAS, said Principal Beverley Louw. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're not against the test," Louw said of her students. "It's just that if 
they don't have to take it, they figure they shouldn't take it." 
</P>
<P>
 The sparse turnout made it unlikely that test results, which are compiled by 
school and district, will be reliable. Just 15% of the district's sophomores 
took the test. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, there's possibly a problem here," said Gerry Shelton, a consultant to 
the state Department of Education on the CLAS test. The state will have to 
evaluate the sample size and whether the students who took it are 
representative of the entire school. "When we do have the data, we're going to 
look school-by-school at this issue and make a determination." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Department of Education agreed in April to allow parents to keep 
their children from taking the test, spokeswoman Susie Lange said at least 90% 
of the students statewide in fourth, fifth, eighth and 10th grades are expected 
to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 While there have been some districts that have had 10% or even 20% of students 
not take CLAS, Shelton said he is not aware of any that had 85% opt out as is 
the case with the Antelope Valley district.

REALITY BITES AS CITY'S 20-YEAR BLUEPRINT ENTERS FINAL PHASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AARON CURTISS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles of the future looks pretty good on paper: a bustling 
metropolis where streets are safe and full of life, where public transit whisks 
commuters swiftly and comfortably from place to place, where residents poor and 
rich have equal access to parks, schools and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But putting dreams on paper is the easy part. 
</P>
<P>
 As they draw up a blueprint for growth in one of the most complex cities in 
the world, Los Angeles planners are discovering that reconciling the public's 
dreams with reality is tremendously more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year task of updating the city's General Plan is entering its final 
months. In many ways this will be the undertaking's most complicated phase as 
planners try to marry a vision for the future with the realities of the 
present. 
</P>
<P>
 They face the challenge of making the city a more business-friendly place 
without sacrificing environmental protection; of promoting the development of 
urban centers without destroying the rich patchwork of single-family 
neighborhoods; of encouraging new forms of transportation without denying the 
region's long love affair with the automobile, and of accommodating an influx 
of more than 800,000 people over the next two decades without overwhelming 
sewers and landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 At a conference today, planners will update their progress toward formulating 
a 20-year development strategy for the city and discuss how forecasts of 
traffic congestion, sewage capacity and unemployment levels will shape the 
plan's final form. The meeting is at 9 a.m. in the conference center of the 
Department of Water and Power's Downtown headquarters, 111 N. Hope St. 
</P>
<P>
 "Where do we think the current trends lead us in economics, the infrastructure 
and traffic?" asked Con Howe, the city's planning director. "If we do not 
change our policies and our actions, what is likely to happen? Those questions 
are important backdrops for saying if this is not what we like and not what we 
want to see, then we will have to make some changes." 
</P>
<P>
 Already, early versions of the plan present a vision of Los Angeles that is in 
some ways dramatically different from how the city has developed over the past 
century, but is in other ways comfortably similar. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Plan serves essentially as the city's land-use constitution, 
governing how and where Los Angeles will develop over time. It establishes 
broad policies and sets the tone for the more detailed community plans, which 
dictate how specific neighborhoods will grow block by block. 
</P>
<P>
 A carefully crafted plan that is followed over the long term can help provide 
the stability desired by residents as well as developers, and directs costly 
infrastructure improvements to where they are most needed. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, planners have conducted dozens of workshops all over the 
city, asking residents how they want their neighborhoods to look, feel and move 
20 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The product of those workshops is what the planners call the Directed Growth 
Strategy, a policy that seeks to channel 75% of the new growth over the next 
two decades onto 5% of the city's land -- ideally, those areas best equipped 
with infrastructure such as roads and sewers to handle a greater number of 
people. 
</P>
<P>
 This 5% -- generally along major boulevards and in such areas as Warner Center 
and Downtown -- would accommodate 75% of new homes and apartments as well as 
90% of new offices and shops. The remainder would be distributed as evenly as 
possible throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of reasons for this approach, but all have their roots in 
the spread-out style in which Los Angeles has traditionally developed. Since 
very few neighborhoods in the city have a classic "urban" character, there are 
relatively few places with the sort of vitality and street life found in most 
major cities. 
</P>
<P>
 By increasing densities in targeted neighborhoods, planners hope to make 
transportation to those areas more feasible as well as create "urban villages," 
where jobs and shops would be close to houses and apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In another radical departure from the city's past, planners are suggesting 
building apartments and condominiums above ground-floor shops and offices. This 
"mixed-use" development conserves space and encourages walking rather than 
driving. More than 90% of housing built over the next 20 years will be 
apartments and condominiums. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, channeling growth into targeted areas protects most 
single-family neighborhoods from the intrusive growth that results in 
single-story bungalows next door to four-story stucco apartment buildings. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet city archives are full of ambitious plans that were never realized. Even 
the city's current General Plan, adopted in 1974 and never fully implemented, 
is considered a good one. Without the legal teeth and the commitment of 
political leaders behind it, the new plan will go nowhere. 
</P>
<P>
 There is discussion in the highest levels of the Planning Department over how 
to make the plan stick. Among the most effective methods would be to restrict 
and monitor development outside the targeted growth areas so large-scale 
projects would be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the city can be the master of its own destiny to some extent," Howe 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But even if the city's population remains stable, traffic on its streets and 
freeways will continue to slow down because of development in surrounding 
cities, according to transportation consultant Bradlee Williams. 
</P>
<P>
 Heavy reliance on automobiles involves a price beyond the obvious problems of 
traffic congestion and air quality. Roughly 35% of the city's land is taken up 
by roads, driveways and parking lots. By comparison, the entire stock of houses 
and apartments occupies 38% of the land. 
</P>
<P>
 Over the next 20 years, Williams estimates, traffic will increase by 35% and 
average speed is forecast to drop to less than 35 m.p.h. In areas such as 
Granada Hills, the gateway into the city for commuters from northern Los 
Angeles County, average speed will drop below 10 m.p.h. 
</P>
<P>
 "One-third of all the traffic we have now is going to be added again," 
Williams said, explaining that the type of traffic jams that followed the 
Northridge earthquake will become ordinary. "That was really just a foretaste 
of what's to come. That is going to be common." 
</P>
<P>
 Likewise, the city's economic development is affected by the overall health of 
the region, and vice versa. "If the city strangles, the region strangles," said 
economic consultant Jay Natelson, president of the Natelson Co. 
</P>
<P>
 But the next 20 years will be dramatically different from the past 20 years. 
Natelson predicts the need for new commercial space will taper to less than 
one-third the amount built between 1980 and 1990.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, the city desperately needs more housing units that are safe and 
affordable. Between 1980 and 1990, the city's population grew by 17%, but the 
housing stock grew by only 9%. Consequently, 22% of Los Angeles' housing units 
are overcrowded and 35% of households pay more than one-third of their income 
for rent or mortgage. 
</P>
<P>
 The population will continue to grow over the next two decades, but city 
officials are concerned that our infrastructure -- facilities such as landfills 
and sewer systems -- may not be able to keep pace. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, sewer systems are operating near capacity, said engineer Armen 
Melkonian. And landfills are filling up quickly. Efforts to plan and build new 
facilities are time-consuming and costly. Drawing board errors can make them 
even more so.  
</P>
<P>
 "Reliability is the key," Melkonian said. The State of the City POPULATION 
Over the next 20 years, Los Angeles is expected to grow by about 822,000 people 
to 4.3 million -- an increase of 24%. By contrast, the five-county area that 
surrounds Los Angeles is expected to grow from 14.5 million to 20.3 million -- 
an increase of 40%. Most of the growth -- 63% -- will come from births. The 
rest will be foreign immigration. The influx from other states will fall to 
insignificant levels. As it is, the city is among the most diverse in the 
world. 
</P>
<P>
 Latino: 40% 
</P>
<P>
 White: 37% 
</P>
<P>
 Black: 13% 
</P>
<P>
 Asian and Pacific Islander: 9%

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Average residential density in the city is roughly 12 units per acre, ranging 
from four units per acre in Bel-Air to 71 units per acre in Westlake and 131 in 
Central City. HOUSING Roughly 60% -- or 780,000 -- of the housing units in Los 
Angeles are apartments and condominiums. The other 40% -- or 520,000 -- are 
single-family homes. About 57% of housing units are occupied by renters. 
Another 37% are occupied by their owners and 6% are vacant. About 29% of 
existing housing units are at least 50 years old and 40% are over 40 years old. 
About 11% were built in the last decade and 22% in the past 20 years. ECONOMICS 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles is the largest employment center in Southern California, with 
roughly 1.9 million jobs. Between 1960 and 1990 manufacturing jobs in Los 
Angeles declined by 31%, while professional and service jobs increased by 71%. 
Between 1990 and 1992, the state lost 523,000 manufacturing jobs. Two-thirds of 
the loss occurred in Los Angeles. TRANSPORTATION 
</P>
<P>
 About 57 million miles are traveled each day in Los Angeles, or 15.4 million 
person trips and 10.6 million vehicle trips daily. Only 5% of trips are made by 
public transit.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUDGE 
REFUSES TO DISMISS CHARGES IN CASTRATION CASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge refused this week to dismiss battery charges against a woman who says 
she acted in self-defense when she cut off her husband's testicles with a pair 
of scissors. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even without any newly discovered evidence, I felt that a dismissal would not 
be warranted, and I still feel that way," said Superior Court Judge Robert 
O'Neill, who rejected a similar motion in April. 
</P>
<P>
 Aurelia Macias, 36, was acquitted of mayhem and assault with a deadly weapon 
in March in connection with a September, 1990, attack on her husband, Jaime. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury deadlocked 7 to 5 in favor of acquitting her on a charge of battery 
with serious bodily injury. She is to stand trial again on that charge in 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender Nan Whitfield told O'Neill on Thursday that in the 
interest of justice the case did not warrant a second trial. Whitfield 
maintained that Jaime Macias has never wanted the case prosecuted. 
</P>
<P>
 She told the judge that the attention surrounding the case was destroying the 
couple's family. Their children have threatened to run away from home if the 
matter continues, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 During the trial, the defense said Aurelia Macias had endured a violent, 
17-year marriage and was acting in self-defense. Prosecutors contended the 
woman attacked her husband because he had flirted with a woman at a party.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; JUDGE 
REJECTS OFFICER'S BID TO VOID MURDER CHARGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge refused Friday to dismiss a murder charge against a veteran police 
officer who shot a tow truck driver while on duty, rejecting a claim that the 
attorney-client privilege was breached.  
</P>
<P>
 William Kopeny said that two conversations Deputy Dist. Atty.Katherine Mader 
had with Deputy City Atty. Don Vincent, who was representing Officer Douglas 
Iversen in a civil lawsuit brought by the dead man's family, violated his 
client's due process rights.  
</P>
<P>
 The talks came to light when Mader turned over notes of a phone conversation 
she had with Vincent on April 14, 1993, two months before charges were filed 
against Iversen, 44.  
</P>
<P>
 Mader testified she called Vincent to find out why the lawsuit with the late 
John L. Daniels' family was settled out of court. The city paid Daniels' wife, 
Michelle, and his two children $1.2 million.  
</P>
<P>
 In her notes, the prosecutor wrote that Vincent gave her several reasons for 
the settlement: to protect the officer from punitive damages; the community 
thought the shooting of the black tow truck driver by a white police officer 
was outrageous, and that a reasonable basis for the shooting could not be 
determined. 
</P>
<P>
 Iversen says that he saved lives when he shot Daniels on July 1, 1992, at a 
gas station on Crenshaw Boulevard and Florence Avenue. The veteran motorcycle 
officer said he was trying to check the truck's registration because he 
suspected the vehicle was unregistered. He said Daniels refused and it appeared 
he would run down pedestrians in the gas station driveway if he were allowed to 
drive off.  
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the shooting was unjustified. They allege Iversen lost his 
temper when Daniels refused to submit to the officer's authority.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: ANTELOPE VALLEY; CLAS 
TEST OFFERED UNDER COURT ORDER; FEW TAKE IT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Antelope Valley Union High School district offered the controversial 
California Learning Assessment System tests Friday under court order, but only 
460 of 3,000 sophomores chose to take it. 
</P>
<P>
 Most students decided not to take it because it conflicted with preparations 
for final exams. 
</P>
<P>
 Students who took the CLAS test said they were motivated by a variety of 
reasons, with many saying they were unhappy that the district's Board of 
Education prevented them from taking it earlier. 
</P>
<P>
 The board had voted 3 to 2 to boycott the tests, citing objections to the 
content and style of the statewide exams.

 Hardly a storybook ending: A package sent to the offices of billionaire Marvin 
Davis arrived Friday at the 32-story Fox Plaza Building in Century City bearing 
the words, "This is a bomb threat." 
</P>
<P>
 Members of the LAPD's bomb squad rushed in, hoping they wouldn't experience a 
real-life version of "Die Hard," the Bruce Willis thriller that was shot there. 
Fortunately, when the package was destroyed with a low-charge explosive, it was 
determined to be "a movie manuscript," Detective Lawrence Garrett said. 
</P>
<P>
 Since the thoughtful sender left a return address, officers found him and were 
told that he "wanted to draw attention to his package." The unidentified 
screenwriter was not charged. Incidentally, Garrett said the script appeared to 
be "about a human bomb."

 A note from the teacher: Our mention of Beverly Aadland, the 15-year-old 
girlfriend of grown-up actor Errol Flynn in the 1950s, brought a letter from 
her former junior high school teacher.  
</P>
<P>
 "In my English/Social Studies classes, she was a pretty sharp little gal," 
writes Ellen Rainier, who taught at Horace Mann near Florence and Normandie 
avenues in L.A. "I haven't forgotten her and am sorry to have lost track of 
her. However it hasn't been too difficult to keep track of (grads) Joel Wachs 
(1953) and Gil Garcetti (1956). They both were pretty sharp little guys, too." 
</P>
<P>
 Hmmm. Wachs . . . Garcetti . . . The names sound sort of familiar but. . . . 
miscelLAny:

 Pasadena's Suicide Bridge, the jumping-off spot of more than 100 people since 
1912, was a safe place to be Jan. 17. The Colorado Street bridge came through 
the big quake with no damage. Still standing, in other words.

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; KIWANIS CLUB TO LAUD POLICE OFFICERS

<P>
 Lt. Don Meredith thought the sound was a gunshot. 
</P>
<P>
 But the popping noise he heard near a Glendale apartment building was actually 
a Molotov cocktail thrown at the Mariposa Street complex by a suspect who was 
quarreling with one of the residents. 
</P>
<P>
 The flaming makeshift device ignited nearby brush, and Meredith ran into the 
building to warn tenants. Firefighters later contained the fire with minimal 
damage to the small apartment complex. 
</P>
<P>
 Meredith will be one of 10 police officers honored for bravery, dedication and 
civic and professional achievements by Kiwanis Club members at the club's 
second annual Police Appreciation Day next Friday.  
</P>
<P>
 About 200 Kiwanis members and city dignitaries are expected to attend the noon 
awards ceremony at the Verdugo Club, 400 W. Glenoaks Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents belonging to the six Glendale Kiwanis clubs created Police 
Appreciation Day last year to combat negative publicity about police officers 
that stemmed from the Rodney King beating trials. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to create a positive image of police by recognizing the good 
officers that are out there on the streets every day," said Randy Karraker, 
president of the Jewel City Kiwanis. 
</P>
<P>
 Other officers being honored for capturing suspects who allegedly set the 
Mariposa Avenue fire are officers Daniel Hinojosa Todd Sorensen, Tracy Lowrey 
and Jeffrey Newton and Sgt. James Lowrey. 
</P>
<P>
 Others receiving awards are: Officer Curtiss Kakiki, for chasing suspects 
wanted in a liquor store robbery into Hollywood while they were shooting at him 
with semiautomatic rifles; Officer Kevin Hirano, for spotting suspects wanted 
in a Montrose robbery and pursuing them in a high-speed freeway chase; Officer 
Dominic Borrelli, who rescued an unconscious elderly woman from a burning 
apartment building; and Sgt. Terry Jones, who, while jogging on his lunch 
break, tackled a suspect who had just snatched a woman's purse. JENNIFER OLDHAM

 Graduating seniors of Verdugo Hills High School in Tujunga got a sobering 
wake-up call Friday from Assemblyman Bill Hoge -- a pickup truck that had been 
wrecked in an alcohol-related accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "We hope this really drives a point about drunk driving," said Christine 
McLeod, one of Hoge's field representatives who presented the mangled vehicle 
to the seniors. 
</P>
<P>
 Hoge (R-Pasadena) annually arranges for a wrecked car to be exhibited at a 
local high school before graduation to remind seniors about the fatal 
consequences of driving under the influence of alcohol or drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, during May and June, 12 teen-agers were killed in alcohol-involved 
crashes in Los Angeles County, according to state statistics, Hoge said. 
</P>
<P>
 At Friday's presentation, senior class President Rafael Paz told his 
classmates, "The last thing I want to do right after graduation is to go to one 
of your funerals."  
</P>
<P>
 Junior Maryann May dressed as the Grim Reaper representing the death that 
could occur in a driving-under-the-influence accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kids don't listen," said Principal Gary Turner. "But when they see something 
like this, they go, 'Oh. That's important.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Although no students at his high school have been killed in drunk-driving 
accidents, Turner said that during the six years he has been principal, six 
Verdugo students have died due to careless driving. 
</P>
<P>
 Carmelia Mejia, student body president, said the truck will show students that 
"people aren't immortal, and that goes for teen-agers as well as adults." 
</P>
<P>
 As an alternative to alcohol-related parties, many Verdugo Hills graduates 
will participate in the Disneyland grad night, where no alcohol is served and 
participants are searched at the entrance. 
</P>
<P>
 In a handout about Sober Graduation, the seniors were given a list of recipes 
for nonalcoholic beverages from California hotel bars such as the Hotel Nikko's 
Tropical Fruit Fizz, which combines pineapple and orange juices, sweet and sour 
mix, grenadine with ginger ale. MAKI BECKER

GLENDALE / BURBANK FOCUS: GLENDALE; SUSPECTS HELD AFTER 2ND ROBBERY AT STORE 
</P>

<P>
 Two Los Angeles men who allegedly were successful in their first attempt to 
rob a Glendale comic book store were arrested this week after a second robbery 
of the same store, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Allan Reyes Villa, 18, and Eric Nagallanes, 18, were arrested late Wednesday 
night after an unknown amount of money and valuable baseball cards were taken 
from Legacy Comics, 123 W. Wilson Ave., Police Officer Rod Brooks said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was believed to be the second time the men had robbed the store, Brooks 
said. Suspects evaded police after taking $5,000 worth of baseball and hockey 
cards May 25, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other suspects arrested and booked on suspicion of first-degree robbery in 
Wednesday night's incident were Errold Punay Nagallanes, 19, of Los Angeles, 
and a 15-year-old Los Angeles juvenile.  
</P>
<P>
 The suspects, except for the teen-ager who was taken to Los Padrinos Juvenile 
Detention Center, are being held in Glendale City Jail in lieu of $75,000 bail 
each. An arraignment date has not been set. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the four suspects were waving loaded guns when they approached the 
owner of Legacy Comics, Howard Chen, right after closing time Wednesday night, 
police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen and his clerk, Ernie Pukler, were forced into the store office, ordered 
to lie face down on the floor, and were tied up, Brooks said. The robbers then 
ransacked the front of the store, took money from the cash register and fled 
through the front door, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Chen managed to free himself and called police. A witness told officers that 
the suspects had escaped up an alley near E. Wilson Avenue and N. Orange 
Street, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers later arrested three of the suspects near the alley. The fourth 
suspect, the juvenile, was arrested at his Los Angeles home early Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Police found money, comic books and baseball cards in the alley, along with a 
22-caliber revolver, a .357 magnum revolver and a Colt .45 automatic handgun, 
Brooks said. JENNIFER OLDHAM

<P>
 Several downtown streets will be reduced to one lane later this summer to make 
way for the second and third phases of an $810,160 storm drain project designed 
to solve flooding problems in Glendale's Civic Center area. 
</P>
<P>
 Portions of Wilson Avenue, Isabel Street, Louise Street and Lexington Drive 
will be cordoned off to one lane and flaggers will direct traffic beginning in 
early August and ending in December, said Steven Herbert, a spokesman for Los 
Angeles County Supervisor Michael Antonovich. 
</P>
<P>
 Workers will dig up asphalt on the byways during the three-month project and 
install about 6,000 feet of the Belson Drain -- a storm drain designed to pull 
water down under the street's surface during heavy rains. 
</P>
<P>
 Majich Bros. Inc. of Altadena was chosen by the Board of Supervisors to 
complete the project. JENNIFER OLDHAM

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; CATERER 
WINS RIGHT TO SUE DWP FOR BILL DURING STRIKE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A judge refused Friday to throw out a lawsuit filed by a caterer who says the 
city's Department of Water and Power owes him $70,874 for food delivered to 
managers during last year's nine-day strike.  
</P>
<P>
 City lawyers tried to show that Beck & Call Catering could not recover 
damages, which would have allowed the judge to throw the case out.But Superior 
Court Judge David Horowitz ruled that the caterer has a strong enough case to 
proceed. He gave the DWP 20 days to answer the allegations.  
</P>
<P>
 The catering DWP ordered was done under an emergency provision that allows 
managers to make a contract without getting bids or authorization from 
superiors. But the DWP came under fire when city accountants reviewed the bill 
-- which averaged out to $120 a day per manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Beck & Call catered the first day's meals, but after that managers clamored 
for better food, including more fresh fruit and vegetables and better overall 
quality. The emergency contract was renegotiated.  
</P>
<P>
 The city has paid $273,174 of the $344,048 bill, but city lawyers contend DWP 
officials did not have the authority for the renegotiation so they refused to 
pay the difference.

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SYLMAR; SEMINARS OFFER TIPS FOR OLDER SCHOLARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ED BOND 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A daylong series of seminars designed to help students returning to school 
after long absences is planned next month at Mission College. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really helps them get through a lot of the fears they have in returning," 
said Geri Shapiro, counselor with the New Horizons program, a federally funded 
program to help single parents and others who are going back to college in 
order to get a better job. 
</P>
<P>
 "What happens is that returning students actually do better than they expect," 
Shapiro added. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminars, scheduled to run from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. July 15, are 
planned for the college's Third Annual Re-entry Day program. 
</P>
<P>
 Shapiro, a returning student at Pierce College 16 years ago, said she 
understands the pressures involved. "I was pretty nervous at first. But once 
you have some success it builds your confidence." 
</P>
<P>
 The student population at Mission is predominantly part time and mostly women 
and mostly Latino, Shapiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is a very high percentage of returning students at Mission College," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Seminar topics include stress management, career counseling, building 
self-esteem and assertiveness, overcoming addictive behaviors and tips on 
surviving school. 
</P>
<P>
 The school survival tips are concepts that those who have been away from 
school for a long while may have forgotten -- time management, the use of study 
groups, working in a library to get away from the noise and distraction at 
home, using index cards to study for tests and taking regular breaks during 
long periods of work. 
</P>
<P>
 The seminars are free to returning students or those considering going back to 
college. To register, contact Shapiro at the college. ED BOND

PLAYBOY FANS AT REMOTE STATION DOWNPLAY RULING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN M. GLIONNA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It is by far the loneliest outpost in all of Los Angeles County -- a single 
trailer squatting on a dusty, High Desert plain that more resembles the surface 
of Mars than planet Earth. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, county Fire Station 114 in Lake Los Angeles -- outside even far-flung 
Palmdale -- is an unlikely source of a 1st Amendment issue that has created a 
blaze of controversy: Can firefighters read adult magazines or any publication 
showing too much flesh? 
</P>
<P>
 This week, a federal judge struck down a county order forbidding its 
firefighters to read or possess Playboy magazine, ruling that the measure 
against sexual harassment violated free speech. 
</P>
<P>
 And it is here, where tumbleweeds and Joshua trees outnumber humans about a 
billion to one, where the battle started. 
</P>
<P>
 Fire Station 114 is not a conventional fire station. There are no slippery 
metal poles that firefighters slide down before rushing to a fleet of waiting 
firetrucks. 
</P>
<P>
 It is a trailer in the far northeastern corner of the Antelope Valley staffed 
by rotating crews of three male firefighters. The fire crew is responsible for 
a 400-square-mile desert area where the hottest thing is usually the asphalt on 
a summer day. 
</P>
<P>
 Duty here is perhaps best symbolized by the station's gear: one truck and one 
helper vehicle. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 So when Fire Department Capt. Steven W. Johnson decided to contest newly 
released Fire Department policies on adult magazines, it was like waifs in 
Siberia challenging doctrines issued directly from the Kremlin. 
</P>
<P>
 "We always joke that this fire station is the kind of place the department 
would send somebody for disciplinary reasons," Johnson said Friday. "So when I 
decided to challenge the department, I knew they really couldn't do anything to 
hurt me. Heck, I was already working at Lake Los Angeles." 
</P>
<P>
 That was two years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the policy and said to myself, 'This is a good thing. They have a 
policy that will help me as a supervisor,' " he said. "Then I got to item 3C, 
the part about banning the magazines and I said, 'I'm just not gonna stand for 
this. I'm gonna challenge it.' " 
</P>
<P>
 So Johnson, a Corona del Mar resident and Playboy subscriber who brought his 
copies to the station, decided to fight. He called the magazine's Western 
offices. Then he filed an interdepartmental grievance to settle the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 When that didn't work, the matter went to court. County attorneys defended the 
policy, saying the measure was needed to prevent a sexually charged environment 
at county firehouses. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point during the trial, one county official said the ban would apply to 
certain issues of mainstream magazines, such as Vanity Fair, Rolling Stone and 
Sports Illustrated, that contained pictures of partially nude women. 
</P>
<P>
 The fellows at Station 114 couldn't believe it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The department already had a policy dating back to 1987 taking care of sexual 
harassment, for thrusting a centerfold into somebody's face," Johnson said. 
"But when they included the idea that the magazines caused a hostile workplace, 
I thought they went too far. And the judge agreed with me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, firefighters at Station 114 were nonchalant about the ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, we're gonna break out the Kool-Aid and cookies and have ourselves a 
celebration any moment now," said Adrian Asencio, 49, who has worked at Lake 
Los Angeles for two years,  
</P>
<P>
 Although Station 114 may be a bit rural, the firefighters say they don't 
exactly have all day to sit around reading Playboy. The air-conditioned 
trailer, which includes three bedrooms, a living room with three beat-up 
recliners and a 30-inch color television, is no fraternity house, they say. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, we probably have more horse magazines around here" than adult 
magazines, said Capt. Bob Hancock, pointing to a bed stand with three issues of 
Horse Illustrated, Western Horseman and Horse and Rider magazines. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, before the ruling, firefighters at Lake Los Angeles -- and many of the 
Fire Department's 130 other stations -- bought Playboy magazine for the station 
house with a fund used to buy food, coffee and other essentials. 
</P>
<P>
 Most times, the magazines were not left out in stacks. There was too much 
public traffic at Station 114 for that. They were kept in lockers, hidden away. 
</P>
<P>
 "You didn't have guys sitting her gawking like fools," Asencio said. "Myself, 
I like the magazine. I think the articles are great. It's one of the Cadillacs 
of magazines for the quality of its stories." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Tension over the magazines did not erupt over complaints from any of the 11 
female firefighters in the 2,500-member department. 
</P>
<P>
 Firefighters say there had been some complaints from a group known as 
Firefighters for Christ, whose members have spoken out against pornography. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are a few individuals who don't like Playboy," Johnson said. "And they 
have decided that the best way to get rid of the magazine are these sexual 
harassment rules." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the ruling, Johnson has hit the talk show circuit, telling his story on 
radio stations as far away as St. Louis and Perth, Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "This isn't just a win for Steve Johnson. It's a win for the Fire Department 
and truly for the 1st Amendment," he said. "Those who don't like Playboy don't 
have to look at it -- simple as that." 
</P>
<P>
 At Station 114, firefighters plan to pick up the latest issue of Playboy, 
which features a spread on female firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ten years ago, the magazine featured a gal posing on a firetruck and it was a 
hot item," Asencio said. "I'm sure this one will be even better."

REFINING A VISION OF L.A.'S FUTURE; DEVELOPMENT: PLANNERS WILL CONVENE TODAY TO 
UPDATE PROGRESS ON THE GENERAL PLAN. DISCUSSIONS WILL FOCUS ON TRAFFIC, SEWAGE 
CAPACITY AND JOBLESS LEVELS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

 The Los Angeles of the future looks pretty good on paper: a bustling 
metropolis where streets are safe and full of life, where public transit whisks 
commuters swiftly and comfortably from place to place, where poor and rich 
alike have equal access to parks, schools and jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But putting dreams on paper is the easy part. 
</P>
<P>
 As they draw up a blueprint for growth in one of the most complex cities in 
the world, Los Angeles planners are reminded that reconciling the public's 
dreams with reality is infinitely more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-year task of updating the city's General Plan is entering its final 
months. In many ways, this will be the most complicated phase as planners try 
to marry a vision for the future with the realities of the present. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 They face the challenge of making the city a more competitive place to do 
business without sacrificing environmental protection; of promoting the 
development of urban centers without destroying the landscape of single-family 
neighborhoods; of encouraging new forms of transportation without denying the 
region's long love affair with the automobile, and of accommodating an influx 
of more than 800,000 people over the next 20 years without overwhelming sewers 
and landfills. 
</P>
<P>
 At a daylong conference today that is open to the public, planners will update 
their progress toward formulating a 20-year development strategy for the city 
and discuss how forecasts of traffic congestion, sewage capacity and 
unemployment levels will shape the plan's final form. The meeting is at 9 a.m. 
in the conference center of the Department of Water and Power's Downtown 
headquarters, 111 North Hope St. 
</P>
<P>
 The General Plan serves as the city's land-use map, governing how and where 
the city will develop. It establishes broad policies and sets the tone for the 
more detailed community plans, which dictate how specific neighborhoods will 
grow.  
</P>
<P>
 Over the past year, planners have conducted dozens of workshops across the 
city, asking residents how they wanted their neighborhoods to look, feel and 
move 20 years from now. 
</P>
<P>
 The product of those workshops is a policy that seeks to channel 75% of the 
projected growth over the next two decades onto 5% of the city's land -- 
ideally, those areas best equipped with infrastructure such as roads and sewers 
to handle a greater number of people. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 This 5% -- generally along major boulevards and in areas such as Warner Center 
or Downtown -- would accommodate 75% of all new homes and apartments as well as 
90% of all new offices and shops. The other 25% of growth would be distributed 
as evenly as possible throughout the city. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a number of reasons for this approach, but all have their roots in 
the spread-out way Los Angeles has traditionally developed. Since very few 
neighborhoods in the city are particularly urban, there are relatively few 
places that have the sort of vitality and street life found in most other major 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
 By increasing densities in targeted neighborhoods, planners hope to make 
transportation to those areas more feasible as well as to create so-called 
urban villages, where jobs and shops would be in close proximity to houses and 
apartments. 
</P>
<P>
 In another radical departure from the way Los Angeles has traditionally 
developed, planners are suggesting building apartments and condominiums above 
ground-floor shops and offices. This mixed-use development conserves space and 
encourages walking rather than driving. More than 90% of all new housing built 
over the next 20 years will be apartments or condominiums.

PANEL OKS DROPPING WALL-SCALING TEST FOR POLICE APPLICANTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A city commission on Friday endorsed sweeping changes in the entrance 
requirements to the Los Angeles Police Academy -- including elimination of a 
six-foot wall that has posed a special obstacle to women. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes approved by the Civil Service Commission call for a more 
comprehensive essay and different reading and English usage questions. But most 
important, the new test would replace physical requirements such as pulling a 
dead weight and scaling the six-foot wall. 
</P>
<P>
 The new test would employ special machines or other more scientific methods of 
determining endurance, strength and flexibility. 
</P>
<P>
 The changes, designed to modernize a test that the Police Department has used 
for decades, were recommended last month by the city Personnel Department after 
a two-year study of the police selection process. The proposals face additional 
approvals in the coming months before they become final. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials emphasized that the changes, if implemented, would only apply to 
academy applicants. All graduates would still have to scale the six-foot wall 
and meet other state-mandated requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 "I would not have voted for this if I felt that in any way this was an issue 
of lowering standards," said Joe Gelman, president of the Civil Service 
Commission. "Whoever gets past the academy will still have to get over the 
wall. There will not be one cop on the street who has not gotten over the 
wall." 
</P>
<P>
 The wall has been the most-criticized aspect of the current test because women 
tend to fail at significantly greater rates than men. 
</P>
<P>
 Designed to approximate the fences that officers occasionally mount on the 
job, the six-foot wooden wall is a state requirement for all California peace 
officers, and some studies have said that scaling such obstacles is an 
important part of police work. 
</P>
<P>
 But while most other agencies use the wall only as a graduation requirement, 
the LAPD asks applicants to scale the wall before being admitted to the 
academy. 
</P>
<P>
 As the LAPD moves toward community-based policing, some critics have 
questioned the usefulness of the wall as an entrance requirement -- especially 
because scaling the wall is a skill that can be learned in the academy. 
</P>
<P>
 Police Chief Willie L. Williams has said that he favors keeping the wall as an 
entrance requirement because it is an important part of police work. A 
representative, Deputy Chief Larry Fetters, said Friday the LAPD has not taken 
a position on the recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
 As it is now, police applicants take the physical abilities test after passing 
the written test, undergoing an interview and a medical exam, and passing the 
background check. The wall is part of a battery of physical tests that must be 
accomplished in a set amount of time, meaning that even some of those who 
struggle over the wall can fail by taking too long. 
</P>
<P>
 For those who do not make the cut, there are special classes to help 
applicants on their second try -- and LAPD statistics show that the classes 
boost women's pass rate nearly to that of men. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council's Personnel Committee, headed by Councilwoman Jackie 
Goldberg, will consider the changes to the police test on Wednesday.

MAN CHARGED IN ABDUCTION, RAPE OF 11 WOMEN; CRIME: POLICE SAY FORMER SECURITY 
GUARD KIDNAPED VICTIMS AT GUNPOINT AS THEY LEFT UPSCALE RESTAURANTS AND FORCED 
THEM TO DRIVE TO MOTELS.

<P>
 A former security guard was arraigned Friday on charges of raping at least 11 
women after abducting them outside upscale restaurants and forcing them to 
drive to motels. 
</P>
<P>
 Sean Patrick Mitchell, 33, was named in a 91-count criminal complaint charging 
him with forcible rape, kidnaping for sexual purposes, second-degree robbery 
and other crimes. He was booked Wednesday at the Los Angeles Police 
Department's Wilshire Division jail and is being held without bail. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of rape victims will attempt to identify Mitchell in a lineup Monday. 
His preliminary hearing is scheduled for June 22. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell, who has no felony convictions, previously had been charged with a 
rape in Van Nuys, said his attorney, Douglas McCann. The case was dropped 
shortly before it was to go to trial because of a lack of evidence, McCann 
said. And court records show that Mitchell was also charged with rape, 
kidnaping and a lewd act upon a child, but those charges were dismissed in 
November, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was arrested early Wednesday, McCann said, "no witnesses had 
identified Mitchell, and there was no physical evidence tying him to the 
alleged rapes." 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Atty. Beatriz Donoghue said Mitchell was with two women he 
had just abducted and raped when police surrounded his motel room and arrested 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell is suspected of committing his first rape May 12, and during the next 
few weeks, he raped at least 11 other women, sometimes in pairs, Donoghue said. 
</P>
<P>
 The suspect would follow women in their early 20s leaving trendy restaurants 
in the Wilshire district and the Hollywood area, pulling a gun on them when 
they reached their cars. He then would force them to withdraw money at 
automated teller machines and drive them to motels, Donoghue said. He would 
sometimes rape one woman while the other was locked in the motel bathroom. 
</P>
<P>
 LAPD officers from the Wilshire and Hollywood divisions and county sheriff's 
deputies from the West Hollywood station began a joint investigation into the 
series of rapes. 
</P>
<P>
 After an incident last weekend, Wilshire Division detectives interviewed the 
manager of a South-Central motel where two women had been taken, said LAPD Lt. 
Ross Moen. 
</P>
<P>
 The women were kidnaped by Mitchell at gunpoint late Tuesday night as they 
were leaving a Hollywood restaurant and taken to the motel, Moen said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The manager saw an individual coming into a motel room with two females in 
front of him," Moen said. "The man fit the description of the rapist." 
</P>
<P>
 The manager called police and officers from the 77th Division "responded very 
quickly," Moen said. They went to the room Mitchell had rented and ordered him 
to come out. Moen said Mitchell than gave his gun to a hysterical victim and 
sent her out the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Mitchell was arrested without incident. The women were treated at a local 
hospital and released. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives said there may be other victims who have not come forward. They 
said anyone who has information about other rapes could call them at (213) 
485-6411.

AL MARTINEZ: NOTES FROM A SLEAZEBALL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AL MARTINEZ 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As I was leaving the Gentlemen's Club in Atwater Village the other day, a man 
in a passing car slowed and shouted, "Sleazeball!" and drove off. 
</P>
<P>
 When I got home from work that night, my wife said, "Well, how was it 
wallowing in filth for lunch?" She wouldn't let me touch her. 
</P>
<P>
 You think it's easy being a newspaper columnist? 
</P>
<P>
 All I did was visit a nude club in order to investigate the wider 
ramifications of moral decline near a suburban neighborhood, and ended up 
getting a lot of heat not only from my wife but from a total stranger. 
</P>
<P>
 I wasn't in the place for longer than 17 minutes (well, maybe 22) but am 
beginning to feel as though I ought to wear a little bell around my neck and 
chant "Unclean" through the streets of L.A. 
</P>
<P>
 This all began when I started getting telephone calls from people in Glendale 
saying I ought to do something about the strip joint opening up in their 
neighborhood. 
</P>
<P>
 Actually, it's in a Los Angeles industrial zone, but close enough to Glendale 
residential areas to cause concern among the Glendalians. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those who called had taken part in a protest picket. He and others 
carried signs in front of the place that said "No Porn" and "This Is SICK!" 
</P>
<P>
 It didn't do any good. The Gentlemen's Club opened as scheduled in a freshly 
painted, yellow and white stucco building with signs of its own that said "Live 
Nude" and "Girls, Girls, Girls." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 None of those who called had actually been in the club. They were going on the 
assumption that anything involving naked women was automatically lewd, a point 
of view dating back to biblical times. 
</P>
<P>
 Although L.A. doesn't mind a little filth and impiety in its back yard, 
Glendale is not that kind of place, except for the guy who went to jail 
recently for stealing women's underwear. 
</P>
<P>
 Most Glendalians do not steal underwear and confine their nudity to the shower 
or to certain times under the covers with a person of the opposite sex to whom 
they are legally wed. 
</P>
<P>
 If God were forced to live in Southern California, he would live in Glendale. 
</P>
<P>
 Realizing the intense moral purity of the town, I decided to see for myself 
just how much the Gentlemen's Club outrages the common decency of those who 
live within its area of evil influence. 
</P>
<P>
 I paid $5 to a fully clothed lady in a booth and then stepped through heavy 
curtains into a large, dimly lit room with two runways surrounded by tiny 
lights. There's a kind of surreal, cosmic glitz to the place, and I spent a few 
moments blinking and wondering if I had been transported through a twilight 
zone to hell or Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 A dozen or so men were in the club during the noon hour, most of them seated 
around the rim of one of the runways. Contrary to what the people who 
telephoned me said, they did not appear to be drooling sex perverts. Most were 
probably transmission dismantlers or drywall plasterers, but some could have 
been X-ray technicians or insurance adjusters. I looked around for my 
cardiologist, but, thank God, he wasn't there. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Liquor is not allowed in places that feature full nudity, but you can buy 
coffee for $4 a cup and other non-alcoholic beverages. A free lunch of pizza, 
fried chicken and some other things was offered, but it just didn't seem right 
eating in the presence of naked women. 
</P>
<P>
 They have names like Bambi and Tiffany and claim they are doing what they're 
doing only to save for college or to support their kids or to donate to their 
church. It's a job. 
</P>
<P>
 They begin dancing scantily clad and end up with nothing on at all, writhing 
and flapping like awkward human pelicans in the throes of dementia. Sometimes 
they swing around a pole placed there for their imagination and amusement, 
other times they wiggle into positions that are less sexual than anatomically 
challenging. 
</P>
<P>
 Are the dances dirty? Well, women playing with themselves onstage to thumping 
rock music might be considered less than moral. But there was no finesse there, 
no grace, no passion of the spirit to ignite prurient fires. Erotica, properly 
presented, ought to inflame. The women at the Gentlemen's Club only saddened. 
</P>
<P>
 I feel sorrier for them than for the community in which they perform, and 
wonder about the diminishing value of human dignity in an age that panders to 
the sleazeball in us all. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe you learned something," my wife said later, after she'd forgiven me. 
I'm not sure we ever do.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: TOWN MEETING EXAMINES LOCAL SCHOOL ISSUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 In an unusual "town hall" meeting to hear community concerns, about 200 
parents, teachers and students met with the Los Angeles Unified School District 
Board of Education in a first-of-its kind workshop format in San Fernando. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than sit through three hours of discussion on education issues, 
participants at Thursday's meeting at San Fernando Elementary School were 
allowed to choose from six one-hour, bilingual workshops that allowed them to 
question administrators on specific issues.  
</P>
<P>
 Leticia Quezada, the board's chairwoman, said the format was chosen by a 
committee of teachers, students, parents and principals. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wanted to hear from them what kind of meetings were appropriate for the 
community," said Quezada, who represents the eastern San Fernando Valley area 
on the board. "They came back and told me that of the meetings held in this 
community, they like to have the small group sessions." 
</P>
<P>
 The bilingual workshops, conducted in classrooms, focused on the district's 
high school complex-cluster transition, the LEARN programs, school safety, 
parent participation, reconfiguration and the bilingual master plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The workshops were followed by a two-hour session in the cafeteria where 
participants reported their findings from the workshop and the public was 
invited to ask other questions. 
</P>
<P>
 Although most of the reports revealed little about what occurred in the 
workshops, the public speaking session did reveal several community concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 Most touching was a plea by 15-year-old Carmen Padilla of Sun Valley, who 
asked the board not to cut funding from the IMPACT program at her high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "If this program did not exist, we would not have a place to turn to," said 
Carmen, who voluntarily entered the peer support group because of troubles at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Reaction to the format was mixed. A few parents were unhappy that they could 
not attend all the workshops. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got the impression that we were going to hear all the issues here in the 
cafeteria," said Elaine Hernandez, 35, who attended the safety workshop. "I 
wanted to listen to what everybody had to say." 
</P>
<P>
 Della Niblett, also a parent of a child at the school, disagreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe that those that have an interest in one thing were able to clarify 
it in a smaller setting," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most participants were happy that the board members came to their neighborhood 
to hear their concerns. 
</P>
<P>
 The meeting was the sixth and final meeting held by the board to hear the 
concerns of Valley residents this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I watch you on TV often and its really amazing to see you all here," said 
Jamie Serrano, 34, of San Fernando. "This is the way it should happen." JEFF

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; SCHOOL DISTRICT CUTS NOT EXPECTED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KURT PITZER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For the first time in five years, the Las Virgenes Unified School District 
expects to make no budget cuts next fiscal year, stopping a trend of increasing 
class sizes and offering fewer special programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "We think we've bottomed out, meaning we probably won't have to cut anything 
further," said Assistant Supt.Donald Zimring. "We're hoping soon to be 
operating with a balanced budget." 
</P>
<P>
 The prestigious school district, which serves more than 10,000 students from 
the mostly affluent towns between the city of Los Angeles and the Ventura 
County line, was forced to raise class-size limits last year as a result of 
increasing costs and decreasing revenues from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The average class size for Calabasas and Agoura high schools and local middle 
schools rose from 36 to about 40 students. 
</P>
<P>
 The district also cut several elementary school programs to help deal with a 
$450,000 shortfall in its $42-million budget, which capped four straight years 
of revenue losses. 
</P>
<P>
 This year's funding picture was improved last fall, when 150 more students 
than expected enrolled. The district receives funding from the state based on 
the number of students it serves. 
</P>
<P>
 In an effort to decrease class sizes next year, the school board this spring 
set up a special fund to hire more teachers. Donations are being solicited from 
individuals, corporations and others, and $12,000 has been collected so far.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: PANEL TO DISCUSS PLAN TO CLOSE LOPEZ DUMP 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A committee of the Los Angeles City Council will meet Monday in Lake View 
Terrace to discuss the closure plans for the controversial Lopez Canyon 
Landfill. 
</P>
<P>
 At the request of Councilman Richard Alarcon, who heads the council's Public 
Works Committee, the meeting was scheduled for 7 p.m. at the Lake View Terrace 
Recreation Center, 11075 Foothill Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents near the landfill have been up in arms since March when the city's 
Bureau of Sanitation recommended that the city renew the city-owned dump's 
temporary operating permit -- due to expire in 1996 -- keeping it open until 
the year 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 The extended life of the landfill could save the city $72 million over the 
cost of hauling city waste to other local dumps, according to city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 But Alarcon has asked sanitation officials to discuss with residents the 
closure plans for the landfill and to outline alternatives to keeping the 
landfill open another four years. HUGO MARTIN

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: STUDENT MAY RETURN AFTER CHURCH RITES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Catholic high school junior who was expelled after getting married in a 
civil ceremony may be reinstated if she is remarried in a Catholic church, the 
Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Los Angeles said. 
</P>
<P>
 Jennifer Espinoza, 17, of Van Nuys, said she was encouraged by the news, but 
admitted to being a bit confused by the whole affair, which began last month 
when Alemany High School officials asked her not to return for her senior year 
because she got married. 
</P>
<P>
 After all, she and husband Caesar, 24 -- an Alemany alumnus and former altar 
boy -- tried unsuccessfully to have a Catholic priest marry them in the first 
place, Espinoza said. 
</P>
<P>
 The answer when they asked this spring was "just a flat-out no," she said. 
Several priests refused to perform the ceremony because she was not yet 18 
years old. 
</P>
<P>
 Archdiocese spokesman Father Gregory Coiro said the priests cited by Espinoza 
deny they were ever approached by the Espinozas. 
</P>
<P>
 Regardless, Coiro said, the young couple deserves to meet with a priest to see 
if they are ready for a church-sanctioned marriage. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're looking here to see if there is the requisite emotional and spiritual 
maturity to be blessed with a sacramental marriage," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Espinozas, both lifelong Catholics, were married April 2 in a Las Vegas 
civil ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after, Jennifer Espinoza received a letter from the Mission Hills 
school saying she could finish this semester but could not return in the fall 
because "It is the policy of the Archdiocese of Los Angeles that married 
students may not attend a Catholic high school." 
</P>
<P>
 It was never clear, however, whether Jennifer was expelled because she was 
married in a civil ceremony, or simply because she was married. 
</P>
<P>
 A civil marriage, which is not recognized by the church, always results in 
expulsion, Coiro said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even a student married in a Catholic ceremony may be asked to leave because 
young marriages are generally discouraged by the church, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Espinozas are now preparing to undergo the traditional Catholic six-month 
marriage preparation program with a priest. 
</P>
<P>
 School officials could allow Jennifer Espinoza to return to class before the 
actual wedding ceremony or they could deny her return even after a church 
wedding, Coiro said. ERIC SLATER

 San Fernando Valley residents can look forward to better drainage, fewer 
rodents and a decrease in foul odors, once this year's catch basin clean-out 
kicks off in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The clean-out effort by the Los Angeles County Department of Public Works is 
scheduled to take nine weeks. It will involve about 5,400 catch basins -- the 
gutters between the curb and the street -- in the area between the beaches to 
just west of downtown, Westlake Village and the incorporated zones around it. 
</P>
<P>
 Drainage cleaning is conducted annually and expected to cost between $40,000 
and $50,000. MAKI BECKER

VIRTUAL REALITY RAISES DRESDEN CHURCH FROM RUBBLE; RESTORATION: USING A 
HEADSET, VIEWERS CAN 'SEE' BUILDING'S ORNATE INTERIOR. COMPUTER SCIENTISTS' 
MODEL WILL BE USED TO GENERATE MONEY TO REBUILD THE HISTORIC STRUCTURE 
DESTROYED IN WORLD WAR II.

<TEXT>
<P>
 As workers in Dresden, Germany, lay the first stones to rebuild a Baroque 
church destroyed in World War II, computer scientists here are creating a 3-D 
version of what the finished project will look like. 
</P>
<P>
 Using a virtual reality headset, viewers can see the blue doors of the church 
open to a view of the ornate ivory and gold altar and the organ that Johann 
Sebastian Bach played in 1736. 
</P>
<P>
 Light coming through the Protestant church's clear windows illuminates 
paintings of the Apostles in the inner dome, which virtual tourists can observe 
more closely by pushing a button to "fly" up there. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM Germany hired the scientists at Research Triangle Institute to help create 
the virtual reality model in order to generate money to rebuild the actual 
Frauenkirche, or Church of Our Lady, said Robert Haak, special projects manager 
for IBM Germany. The reconstruction is expected to cost about $150 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Some critics have questioned the wisdom of spending such a large amount of 
money on the ruined church, which lies in the economically strapped former East 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 But Haak says most Dresden residents support the project. All but 10% of the 
money comes from private donations. 
</P>
<P>
 "One could think it's more important to build apartments," Haak said in a 
telephone interview from his office in Stuttgart. "But the people of Dresden 
want this." 
</P>
<P>
 The Foundation to Rebuild the Frauenkirche, a private group made up mainly of 
Dresden residents, has been working since the late 1980s to generate support 
for the reconstruction. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM Germany offered its help in 1989, providing money, equipment and 
consultants, and workers last year began clearing rubble from the site. They 
expect to complete the project by 2006, the 800th anniversary of the city of 
Dresden, Haak said. 
</P>
<P>
 The original church, on the Elbe River, took about 16 years to build and was 
completed in 1742. 
</P>
<P>
 The church survived the Allied bombing that destroyed much of Dresden in 
February, 1945, but toppled in the firestorm that immediately followed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a very elegant city," said Gerhard Weinberg, a professor specializing 
in World War II history at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. 
</P>
<P>
 Weinberg said rebuilding the Dresden church has political and social 
significance for eastern Germany. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the general sense of rebuilding religious life in a society in which 
religious life was tolerated but discouraged by the Communist regime for 
decades," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The virtual reality model of the church received rave reviews in March, when 
it was unveiled at a computer trade show in Hanover. One person donned a 
special helmet and maneuvered a hand-held control to navigate the tour. For the 
demonstrations, the images were projected onto a small theater screen to be 
viewed by people wearing 3-D glasses. 
</P>
<P>
 The scientists plan to set up a similar demonstration pavilion in Dresden in 
September, Haak said. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's interior is one of the most complex virtual worlds ever 
constructed, said Dale Rowe, director of RTI's Center for Digital Systems. 
</P>
<P>
 Three RTI computer scientists -- Jorge Montoya, Steve Duncan and Jim Chung -- 
developed the virtual reality model of the church's interior from an animated 
model, similar to a computer-generated film, supplied by IBM. 
</P>
<P>
 A French computer graphics artist, Luc Genevriez, directed a team of artists 
who drew the church's interior, working from architectural plans, historical 
descriptions and prewar black and white photographs. 
</P>
<P>
 Haak said only one color photograph existed. In 1943, Adolf Hitler ordered 
that color photographs be taken, and one was recently found in Munich. The 
photo shows the church's inner dome, and Genevriez used it when depicting the 
painted Apostles. 
</P>
<P>
 IBM scientists in New York and the United Kingdom did the calculations for the 
animated computer model.

 The RTI scientists' task was to convert the animated model to a version that 
an individual could "walk through" in real time, Rowe said. 
</P>
<P>
 The animated model took 2 1/2 hours to generate a single scene. To walk 
through the models in virtual reality, the researchers needed to generate 30 
frames per second. 
</P>
<P>
 The complexity of the animated drawings complicated the project, Rowe said. 
The scientists developed a way to simplify the images by mimicking the focus of 
the human eye and narrowing the field of view. 
</P>
<P>
 RTI also enlisted the help of a powerful graphics computer owned by Silicon 
Graphics of Mountain View, Calif., which helped generate the dinosaurs in the 
film "Jurassic Park." 
</P>
<P>
 Haak said the RTI scientists are still working to increase the speed of the 
virtual reality church before the September demonstration in Dresden.

2 MIDAIR CRASH VICTIMS FLEW FOR BURBANK FIRM; INVESTIGATIONS: WITNESSES SAY THE 
TWO PLANES APPEARED TO CLIP WINGS BEFORE PLUNGING INTO FIELDS NEAR AN AIRPORT. 
</P>

 Two people killed in a midair collision of two small planes near Banning 
Municipal Airport on Thursday were employees of a Burbank aerial photography 
business, the company reported Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Curtis, director of marketing and sales for I.K. Curtis Services Inc., 
identified the occupants of the downed Cessna 207 as pilot David Grimm, who was 
married and had four small children, and Brad Newton, both of Burbank. 
</P>
<P>
 Grimm, 32, had worked as an aerial photographer for the last three years, said 
family friend Brandon Eaton. His assignments included taking pictures of 
landscapes for cartographers. He also took pictures of collapsed bridges after 
the Northridge earthquake for the California Department of Transportation. 
</P>
<P>
 When he was younger, Grimm wanted to become a military fighter pilot, Eaton 
said. Over the years, Grimm held several jobs in the aviation industry, 
including baggage handler and pilot instructor. 
</P>
<P>
 "He loved flying and he was making a living at it," Eaton said. "He worked his 
butt off to get to where he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Additional information on Newton, who was not married, could not be obtained 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The pilot of the second aircraft, who also died in the crash, was identified 
only as a Japanese national flying out of Brackett Field in La Verne, said 
Riverside County Sheriff's Department spokesman Mark Lohman. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses said the planes appeared to clip wings before plunging into fields 
on the Morongo Indian Reservation and causing a grass fire. Nobody on the 
ground was injured. 
</P>
<P>
 Lohman said the Piper Cherokee flown by the unidentified pilot was approaching 
the airport and heading into the afternoon sun when it collided with the 
Cessna. 
</P>
<P>
 Witnesses reported that the Piper tried to avoid the Cessna moments before the 
collision, Lohman said. The planes were flying at an altitude of 1,000 to 1,500 
feet, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Curtis said the two-man crew was taking photographs in the area, but said 
other details of the crash would have to come from federal investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Fred O'Donnell, a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration in Los 
Angeles, said Banning Municipal Airport has no air traffic controllers and that 
pilots approaching it are instructed to check the sky on their own for other 
aircraft. The pilots are supposed to then announce their positions and 
intentions on a common radio frequency. 
</P>
<P>
 The aircraft "were responsible for their own navigation and separation," 
O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The radio frequency is not tape recorded, so investigators did not know 
whether either or both pilots had broadcast their locations before colliding, 
O'Donnell said. 
</P>
<P>
 The crash was being investigated by the FAA and the National Transportation 
Safety Board.  
</P>
<P>
 Curtiss said the company has established the Grimm Family Assistance Fund to 
help the pilot's family. 
</P>
<P>
 Donations were being accepted at the company, 2919 Empire Ave., Burbank 91504.

BOYFRIEND SOUGHT IN WOMAN'S DEATH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Police are looking for a man they suspect of shooting his longtime girlfriend 
to death, authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers responding to a phone call from a relative of Victoria Zamora, 28, 
found her dead Friday in the Van Nuys home she shared with Eduardo Perez, 29, 
said Sgt. John Fleming of the Los Angeles Police Department's Van Nuys 
Division.Zamora and Perez lived in the 6200 block of Fulton Avenue with 
Zamora's two children.  
</P>
<P>
 Fleming said Zamora had been shot on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The relative told police that a friend had called, said Zamora was dead and 
implicated Perez in the crime, Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 The weapon, believed to be a large caliber handgun, has not been recovered, 
Fleming said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamora's children have been vacationing in Mexico with her family, police

RULES AGAINST RELIGIOUS HARASSMENT SUPPORTED; CIVIL RIGHTS: MAINLINE GROUPS 
DEFEND PROPOSED FEDERAL GUIDELINES THAT HAVE BEEN UNDER ATTACK BY CONSERVATIVE 
RELIGIOUS GROUPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Religious News Service 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mainline religious groups Thursday came to the defense of proposed guidelines 
aimed at ending religious harassment in the workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines, first proposed by the federal Equal Employment Opportunity 
Commission in October, have been under harsh attack by conservative religious 
groups and are the target of a campaign by conservative-oriented radio talk 
shows. 
</P>
<P>
 "These political groups have irresponsibly abandoned an important protection 
against religious harassment at work," former Rep. John Buchanan (R-Ala.) told 
a news conference held by more than half dozen Protestant, Jewish and civil 
liberties groups. 
</P>
<P>
 Buchanan, senior vice president of the People for the American Way Action 
Fund, said the guidelines "should be clarified, not eliminated." 
</P>
<P>
 Religious harassment is illegal under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 
1964, as is on-the-job harassment based on race, color, gender, national 
origin, age or disability. The EEOC, the federal agency charged with enforcing 
anti-bias employment legislation, prepared the guidelines to help employers 
understand their obligations in preventing harassment of all kinds on the job. 
</P>
<P>
 But conservatives have declared war on the guidelines, arguing that they would 
create a "religion-free" workplace where workers would be unable to share their 
faith with fellow workers. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, for example, the Christian Action Network, in a direct mail 
fund-raising letter, warned that under the guidelines "carrying the Bible, 
wearing a cross, having a calendar with religious scriptures on it, even 
breathing the name of our Lord Jesus -- all may soon be illegal while working." 
</P>
<P>
 But the mainstream groups argued that conservatives are distorting the purpose 
and impact of the guidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 "Religious harassment happens," Oliver Thomas, special counsel for religious 
and civil liberties of the National Council of Churches, told the news 
conference. "Fortunately, it is rare, but it does happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas said that if religion were eliminated from the proposed guidelines, as 
demanded by the conservative groups, "it would signal to the American people 
that religious harassment is of less concern, and therefore of less 
significance, to the federal government than racial or sexual harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even worse, some might mistakenly assume religious harassment is 
permissible," Thomas said. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a great deal of misinformation surrounding this issue," said Melvin 
Salberg, national chairman, and Abraham Foxman, national director, of the 
Anti-Defamation League. 
</P>
<P>
 "Far from limiting employees' religious freedom as some have alleged, these 
guidelines make clear that religious harassment violates federal law and is 
comparable to other forms of prohibited discrimination, such as race, sex and 
national origin," they said in a prepared statement. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year about 800 of the approximately 16,000 harassment complaints filed 
with the EEOC were related to religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The guidelines define harassment as conduct that "denigrates" or shows 
"hostility or aversion" toward someone because of his or her religion. 
Complaints require proof that the conduct created an "offensive work 
environment." 
</P>
<P>
 A fact sheet circulated by the anti-bias agency sought to allay the 
conservatives' concerns, noting that much of the behavior conservatives fear 
would be banned by guidelines would in fact be permissible, including wearing a 
cross or a yarmulke or expressing one's religious beliefs.

TENSIONS ESCALATE AS SOUTHERN BAPTIST CONFERENCE NEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Conservatives who won the battle for control of the Southern Baptist 
Convention are finding the strife is not over in the nation's largest 
Protestant denomination. 
</P>
<P>
 The firing of a popular seminary president and the growing strength of a 
splinter group have placed the Southern Baptist Convention at its most 
significant crossroads since the conservative takeover of the denomination, 
some observers say. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time since 1990, when moderate Baptists mounted a serious 
challenge to the new conservative leadership in the convention, there is a 
close presidential race. Only this time both candidates are conservatives, with 
one favoring closer cooperation with Southern Baptists who are disaffected with 
the current leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 An expected 25,000 delegates to the three-day convention opening Tuesday in 
Orlando, Fla., also may consider proposals to encourage church agencies to cut 
financial ties with the moderate Cooperative Baptist Fellowship and to ask for 
the resignations of the trustees who voted to fire Southwestern Baptist 
Theological Seminary President Russell H. Dilday Jr. 
</P>
<P>
 What once looked like a routine meeting that would offer church leaders and 
their families extended time at Disney World has taken a serious turn, said 
James Hefley, a columnist for the Indiana Baptist who has written six books on 
the Southern Baptist controversy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Dilday affair is the wild card this year," he said. "This Orlando thing 
is not a Mickey Mouse thing anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Since the mid-1960s, the 15.4-million-member Southern Baptist Convention more 
than doubled in size to surge past the declining United Methodist Church as the 
nation's second-largest denomination after the 59-million-member Roman Catholic 
Church. 
</P>
<P>
 But growth has not come easy in the 1990s. The convention grew by less than 1% 
last year. After losing a series of presidential elections, moderates in 1991 
formed their own group, the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship. The fellowship has 
grown rapidly, from 391 churches in 1991 to 1,210 churches in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 The theological differences between moderates and conservatives often fall 
into a gray area, but in general conservatives tend to emphasize their belief 
in the literal truth of the Bible, while moderates would place greater emphasis 
on the ability of believers to interpret the Bible on their own. On church 
issues, for example, moderates would be more likely to support the ordination 
of women or biblical scholarship that views some passages as parables rather 
than historical truths. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the fellowship's members still belong to the Southern Baptist 
Convention, but are increasingly giving more of their funds to non-SBC causes 
such as the Baptist Theological Seminary in Richmond, Va. For example, 
fellowship churches designated 59% of their $4.5 million in 1991 contributions 
to Southern Baptist agencies, but only 25% of the $11.2 million that they gave 
in 1993 went to the convention. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship has not officially declared itself 
a separate denomination, some convention leaders are already considering it 
one, and are proposing to cut all financial ties even if it means some 
financial belt-tightening. The convention received $136.5 million for its 
Cooperative Program in 1993 from nearly 39,000 churches. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rev. Fred Wolfe, head of the denomination's Executive Committee, said it 
would give credibility to the Cooperative Baptist Fellowship to continue taking 
their money. 
</P>
<P>
 "I expect them within the next couple of years to be a new denomination," he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Rev. Cecil Sherman, fellowship moderator, said that not accepting 
their money would only drive some churches farther away from the convention. 
</P>
<P>
 "That would have the effect of enlarging the fence, the chasm, between us," he 
said. "If things like this continue over a long enough period of time, this 
will lead to a separate body." 
</P>
<P>
 The presidential election between Wolfe, who has been endorsed by the 
conservative leadership, and the Rev. Jim Henry of Orlando may offer a 
bellwether of the direction the convention is going to take. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that my election would be a signal the conservative resurgence is 
going to continue in the direction it is going," said Wolfe, the pastor of 
Cottage Hill Baptist Church in Mobile, Ala. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry, head of First Baptist Church of Orlando, says his presidency would 
focus on "healing what has been hurt, and saying let's get on with the 
program." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike Wolfe, he favors continuing to accept money from the moderate 
fellowship as long as no other strings are attached. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Wolfe has been endorsed by many current convention leaders, Henry has 
the backing of Dilday. 
</P>
<P>
 The March firing of Dilday, who led Southwestern seminary in Ft. Worth for 15 
years, has aroused passions and criticism even among conservative Southern 
Baptists. 
</P>
<P>
 The trustees said Dilday assailed individuals who believed in the literal 
truth of the Bible, but opponents said he was let go simply for being open to 
moderates and criticizing the hardball politics of the current conservative 
leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 "The timing of (the trustees') action was tragic," said the Rev. Cecil Sims, 
sponsor of a resolution asking for the resignations of the trustee officers who 
supported Dilday's firing. "The convention had begun to have a little bit of 
the healing spirit, and this just reopened the whole problem."

 A traveling team of youth workers trained by the Nashville-based Sunday School 
Board of the Southern Baptist Convention is bringing low-cost religious day 
camps to several cities, including Los Angeles, this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Up to 250 seventh- through 12th-graders from the inner city will have a chance 
to attend Centrifuge '94 from Aug. 15 to 19. About 250 member churches of the 
Long Beach Harbor, Los Angeles and Crescent Bay Southern Baptist associations 
are lending their support locally to offer the camp at Compton Community 
College. 
</P>
<P>
 Participating youngsters will take part in basketball, volleyball and track, 
among other sports, and spend time each day on a special interest such as 
choir, drama, photography or crafts. They will also study the Bible and share 
worship experiences with new friends, said Juanita Lewis, volunteer youth 
director of the Long Beach Harbor Southern Baptist Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is no staff at many of the medium and small churches in the area to 
offer summer programs other than a vacation Bible school for two to three hours 
each evening for a week," she said, "so the camp is a good opportunity for kids 
to be involved with over the summer." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lewis enjoyed overnight camp growing up in Tennessee, she said that 
for many inner-city youths, the experience is unappealing. "They didn't grow up 
in the rugged countryside and they're not interested in saving up their money 
for it," she said. "A day camp offering sports and things they're used to is 
more appealing." She said the fee would be $50 for the weekday camp. A limited 
number of scholarships are available. 
</P>
<P>
 Lewis, who will be taking time off from her position as a management 
consultant at Southern California Gas Co. to serve as camp coordinator, 
believes that a week of religious experience in a day camp environment can make 
a difference in the life of an inner-city boy or girl. 
</P>
<P>
 "Having them eight hours a day for five days gives us a lot more possibilities 
than seeing them just on Sunday," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We plan to present the Gospel to them in motivational ways. We will equip 
them for survival in the inner-city by presenting the Scriptures in a way that 
will offer them spiritual guidance in their daily life," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents interested in enrolling their teen-agers in Centrifuge '94 must attend 
an informational meeting at a local church. For further information, contact 
Juanita Lewis at (310) 537-7911.

DEFENDANTS IN RETROACTIVE MOLESTATION CASE LOSE DISMISSAL BID; CRIME: UNDER A 
NEW STATE LAW, WILLIAM LYNCH, 64, AND HIS EX-GIRLFRIEND ARE ACCUSED OF ACT THAT 
ALLEGEDLY OCCURRED MORE THAN 20 YEARS AGO.

 A judge refused Friday to dismiss charges against a Santa Clarita man and his 
ex-girlfriend who are being prosecuted under a new state law that allows 
sexual-abuse charges to be brought many years after the alleged incidents. 
</P>
<P>
 William Lynch, 64, entered a plea of not guilty at an arraignment hearing in 
Los Angeles Municipal Court on Friday to charges that he sexually molested four 
girls more than 20 years ago -- charges brought many years after expiration of 
the statute of limitations that until this year would have prevented such a 
prosecution. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch's ex-girlfriend, Mildred Fleetwood, 60, pleaded not guilty during the 
same hearing to charges that she aided and abetted the childhood molestation of 
one of the women, who told authorities that she remembered the alleged attacks 
during a therapy session in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 The new state law allows prosecutors to file charges in sex cases in which 
oral copulation, intercourse or penetration are involved within a year of the 
date a crime is reported to police, regardless of when it was allegedly 
committed. The law limits such complaints to those who were under 18 at the 
time of the alleged assaults and requires that there be evidence to corroborate 
the allegations before charges are filed. 
</P>
<P>
 Attorneys for Lynch and Fleetwood had asked Municipal Judge L. Jeffrey Wiatt 
to dismiss charges against their clients, arguing that the law should not be 
applied retroactively to them since it was passed after the statute of 
limitations in their case had expired. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once the statute of limitations expires, the prosecution and the Legislature 
are out of luck," said Verah Bradford, a public defender representing 
Fleetwood. 
</P>
<P>
 By allowing the charges to stand, Bradford argued, "the court would almost be 
saying there's no good reason for the statute of limitations." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Francesca Frey contended that in passing the law, which 
took effect Jan. 1, the Legislature found that "child molestation is a serious 
enough crime that there should be an exception to the statute of limitations, 
as there is with murder." 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a crime when it happened," Frey said. "It is a crime that will not go 
away." 
</P>
<P>
 Wiatt sided with Frey, finding that if Lynch and Fleetwood committed the acts 
they are accused of, "then they must have known they were crimes." 
</P>
<P>
 "The passage of time does not change that," Wiatt said. 
</P>
<P>
 A preliminary hearing was scheduled for June 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Wiatt also subsequently denied Bradford's request to release Fleetwood -- who 
was described as a retired woman married to a blind, disabled man -- from 
custody without posting $50,000 bail. Lynch is currently out on bail. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview after the hearing, Bradford described the case as "patently 
unfair." The attorney described the alleged victim as a woman with a long 
history of mental problems. 
</P>
<P>
 During a 1992 therapy session, the woman recalled details of Lynch molesting 
her and her childhood friends, with Fleetwood's acquiescence, Frey said. The 
three other alleged victims are sisters, two of whom say they fully remember 
the molestations but did not report them, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch was arrested in April and subsequently charged with 14 counts of lewd 
conduct with a child stemming from alleged attacks on the four women when they 
were between 7 and 13 years old from March, 1967, to July, 1972. 
</P>
<P>
 Fleetwood, who faces eight criminal counts as an accomplice, was arrested in 
Florida, where she lives with her husband. 
</P>
<P>
 Frey said that the Lynch case is the second she knows of in which the new law 
has been challenged. A Municipal Court judge in Mendocino County previously 
denied a defense attorney's request to dismiss charges against his client on 
the grounds that the law should not be applied retroactively. 
</P>
<P>
 Assemblywoman Paula Boland (R-Granada Hills) wrote the law that Lynch and 
Fleetwood have been charged under after learning of the case of Susan Jarreau, 
an Encino resident who says she was sexually abused as a child but did not 
remember the incidents until 10 years later. 
</P>
<P>
 Jarreau could not file criminal charges against her alleged abuser because the 
state statute of limitations, which covers all crimes but murder, barred 
prosecution more than six years after the alleged crime. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial of Lynch and Fleetwood becomes the latest conflict over the theory 
of "recovered memory syndrome," which has divided the mental health profession 
since it surfaced in the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
 Some psychologists contend that child victims repress memories of sexual abuse 
but can retrieve them, sometimes in great detail, in therapy years later. 
Critics maintain the "memories" are caused by overzealous therapists using 
questionable techniques that plant false recollections in the minds of their 
patients. 
</P>
<P>
 In a landmark malpractice suit last month, a jury in Napa concluded that two 
therapists destroyed a man's life by implanting false memories of sexual abuse 
in his daughter's mind, awarding him $500,000 in damages. Gary Ramona, 50, a 
former Robert Mondavi wine executive, brought the suit, saying he lost his 
family, job and reputation after his daughter accused him of sexual abuse in 
1990. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The outcome of the Ramona case sharply contrasts with the highly publicized 
case of George T. Franklin, who was sentenced to life in prison for the fatal 
beating of Susan Nason, 8, of San Mateo in 1969. 
</P>
<P>
 The case was set in motion when Franklin's daughter Eileen said she suddenly 
recalled a long-repressed memory, while looking into her own daughter's eyes, 
of watching her father rape Nason in the family van and beat her with a rock.

REPORT DISCLOSES 2 MCKEON BUSINESS TRIPS IN '93; SANTA CLARITA: THE LAWMAKER 
SAYS HE OBTAINED A WAIVER FROM THE ETHICS COMMITTEE FOR THE EXPENSE-PAID 
WEEKENDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ALAN C. MILLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Rep. Howard P. (Buck) McKeon (R-Santa Clarita), who maintains that he has 
spent little time on his family business since his election to Congress in 
1992, took two business-related trips last year, annual financial disclosure 
reports released Friday show. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said the expense-paid weekend trips to Laguna Nigel and Dallas, 
sponsored by boot companies, had more to do with personal friendship than 
business and he obtained a waiver from the House Ethics Committee to accept 
them. Members are usually prohibited from taking gifts exceeding $250 in value. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon, who owns a chain of Western clothing stores with his brothers, 
received $148,089 in salary from Howard & Phil's Western Wear in 1993, his 
report said. But, as required by House rules, he stepped down as a corporate 
officer and director. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the amount of time he has spent on the business since his election in 
1992 has been "negligible." Democrat James Gilmartin, a Santa Clarita attorney 
who is running against McKeon for the second time, has raised questions about 
McKeon's continued involvement with his company. 
</P>
<P>
 The 1993 financial reports also disclosed that Reps. Henry A. Waxman (D-Los 
Angeles) and Carlos J. Moorhead (R-Glendale) spoke or appeared before various 
groups whose interests they oversee as influential members of the House Energy 
and Commerce Committee. Faced with growing public criticism, the House changed 
its rules several years ago to require lawmakers to give honorariums to 
charities. 
</P>
<P>
 "I find it useful to go out to these groups and explain to them how I see the 
issues in Washington, and I learn from them as well," said Waxman, who made 12 
appearances for a total of $21,900 in 1993 to organizations ranging from the 
American Chiropractic Assn. to the Assn. of National Advertisers. 
</P>
<P>
 "And I enjoy the fact that, in speaking to them, I'm able to donate money to 
charity." 
</P>
<P>
 Moorhead, the ranking Republican on Energy and Commerce, made five appearances 
for a total of $5,500 to groups such as the Snack Food Assn. and the National 
Cable Television Assn. Like Waxman, he said the sponsors of his speeches do not 
gain any special access to him. 
</P>
<P>
 "These groups have a right to hear members of Congress talk to them on issues 
they're concerned with," Moorhead said. "I wish I could do more of them." 
</P>
<P>
 Waxman also traveled to Israel and Hawaii with his wife for conferences. The 
one-week trip to Hawaii for a session on U.S.-Vietnamese relations was 
sponsored by the Aspen Institute, a nonpartisan think tank; the five-day Israel 
trip for a conference of worldwide Jewish parliamentarians was funded by United 
Jewish Appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Less active on the trip and speech fronts was Rep. Howard L. Berman 
(D-Panorama City), who attended a single two-day session held by the Washington 
Institute for Near East Policy in Queenstown, Md., and gave a single speech to 
MCA, Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Anthony C. Beilenson (D-Woodland Hills) took no trips, accepted no gifts 
and made no appearances, his report shows. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon's trips were overnight stays with family members paid for by boot 
companies whose lines of products are carried by Howard & Phil's. McKeon said 
he was uncertain of the value of the transportation, lodging, food and other 
costs but he put it above $250 on his report. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon and his wife and his brothers and their wives were hosted by the Acme 
Boot Co. at a luxury hotel in Laguna Nigel, where they played golf. He said 
this has become an annual event. And McKeon and his brother flew to Dallas for 
an evening and attended a Dallas Cowboys football game the next day as the 
guests of the Justin Boot Co. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's more a friendship deal than anything else," McKeon said. "There's lots 
of companies we can buy boots from. It's developing a relationship." 
</P>
<P>
 To obtain the ethics waiver, McKeon said he had to "stipulate that (the 
companies) don't do any lobbying and had nothing to do with my congressional 
job." 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmartin, McKeon's election opponent, has previously seized upon the fact 
that McKeon and his wife were attending a Western wear convention in Colorado, 
where they own a condominium, during the holiday weekend when the Northridge 
earthquake occurred. McKeon said they were in Colorado at their own expense and 
returned immediately upon learning of the temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilmartin was out of town Friday and could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon also participated in a panel discussion at a meeting of the National 
Assn. of Home Builders in Las Vegas. He told the group to give his $2,000 
honorarium to the Boy Scouts of America. McKeon received a $1,000 campaign 
contribution from the group's PAC since his election, records show. 
</P>
<P>
 McKeon said he agreed to serve on the panel with two Democratic lawmakers 
during the Home Builders event at the request of Jack Shine, a friend and 
political supporter who is active with the association. Shine contributed 
$1,000 to McKeon's initial primary campaign in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did it as a favor to him," said McKeon, who added that he regarded Shine as 
"a longtime friend." And, the lawmaker said, "They wanted a Republican to 
come."

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; 2 HELD IN CARJACKING AT CHURCH PARKING LOT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK SABBATINI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two males suspected of a carjacking in a church parking lot more than a month 
ago have been arrested by Los Angeles County sheriff's deputies, who say they 
also found 45 balloons filled with heroin at the residence of one of them. 
</P>
<P>
 The men allegedly stole a 1988 Saab convertible at gunpoint after their pickup 
truck ran out of gas near the Newhall Church of the Nazarene, Sgt. Howard 
Fairchild said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They left the white pickup truck behind," Fairchild said. "That's basically 
how we tracked these guys." 
</P>
<P>
 Marcos Zazueta, 21, was arrested Thursday in Bakersfield on suspicion of 
carjacking, Fairchild said. A 17-year-old male was arrested later that day at a 
Los Angeles residence where deputies say they found the deflated balloons 
hidden under a pile of clothes in a closet. Fairchild did not know the weight 
or street value of the drugs, but he said the packaging was "indicative of 
sales for heroin." 
</P>
<P>
 The juvenile shared the residence with Miguel Zamora, believed to be about 20 
years old, who had been arrested Wednesday on unrelated drug possession for 
sale charges, Fairchild said. The deputy said investigators believe Zamora 
might also have been involved in the carjacking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to make double-sure he's the guy and then we're going to charge 
him," Fairchild said. 
</P>
<P>
 Zazueta and Zamora are in custody in lieu of $100,000 bail each. The juvenile 
is in custody without bail at Sylmar Juvenile Hall.

RELIGION / JOHN DART; ORGANIZED ATHEISM REACHING OUT, HOPING FOR MORE POSITIVE 
IMAGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Just because many people are deserting the ranks of organized religion doesn't 
mean they're signing up with organized atheism -- a trend the militant 
unbelievers hope to change. 
</P>
<P>
 A widely discussed recent book, "The Culture of Disbelief" by Stephen Carter, 
says U.S. society largely ignores religion, and studies show that the news and 
entertainment media give short shrift to spiritual matters today. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, 20% of adults polled by The Times in the San Fernando Valley 
three years ago said they had no religion -- which matches the findings of 
another statewide survey. 
</P>
<P>
 Does all that mean popularity for Atheists United, a 12-year-old organization 
based in Sherman Oaks? No, says Ken Bonnell, the group's president. 
</P>
<P>
 "Atheists and humanists tend not to be joiners," Bonnell said. The group has 
only 350 members, and only about 100 people normally attend its monthly meeting 
at Burton Chace Park in Marina Del Rey, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Alexander Prairie, who had been president since 1989, resigned last year when 
the board of the all-volunteer Atheists United denied his request for pay. "If 
they want to expand and become more than a backwater outfit, they need to have 
some paid help," Prairie said this week. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, hope springs eternal, even among nonbelievers. 
</P>
<P>
 With a reorganization that enlists more members in more duties, Atheists 
United is seeking a more positive public image and focusing on church-state 
separation issues. 
</P>
<P>
 The group is showing videotaped programs on public access cable television in 
the Los Angeles area, will expand its weekly radio program on KPFK and will 
host the first national meeting of Atheists Alliance in the Valley next year. 
</P>
<P>
 Lee Baker of Toluca Lake, vice president of Atheists United and co-chair of 
the Atheists Alliance meeting, brings a moderate tone to the nonbeliever 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The image of atheism is not enhanced by "futile attempts to convert 
fundamentalists" or by caustic critiques of religion's holy books, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some of my best friends are religious," said Baker, a former fashion designer 
who has been active in the Democratic Party. She said Atheists United is 
forming an activist roster and a toastmasters club in hopes of alerting the 
public "to the dangers of religious right-wing encroachment on our secular 
society." 
</P>
<P>
 "It is time to take our place in the general community as contributors to the 
common good in practical ways," Baker urged in the organization's last 
newsletter. 
</P>
<P>
 Atheist United leaders this week applauded a lawsuit filed Wednesday in 
federal court in Denver by the Freedom From Religion Foundation challenging the 
presence of the motto "In God We Trust" on U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation, based in Madison, Wis., contended that the 1956 law placing 
the motto on money was unconstitutional because it implied government 
endorsement of religion. Two previous legal challenges to the motto, including 
one by Madalyn Murray O'Hair of Austin, Tex. -- who brought the lawsuit that 
banished Bible-reading from U.S. public schools -- were dismissed in the past 
by federal judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Dan Barker, press spokesman for the Wisconsin foundation, said the suit seeks 
to show that "In God We Trust" is commonly understood as a religious 
expression, not as a symbolic or patriotic phrase. A national survey 
commissioned by the foundation found that 61% said the motto was "religious" 
and 71% said it endorsed a belief in God. 
</P>
<P>
 Barker credited Bonnell as "one of those people who has helped on this" by 
urging the foundation to collect evidence to support just such a lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 A retiree who lives in Eagle Rock, Bonnell said Atheists United has few 
resources to bring legal action. But he said he has asked Los Angeles County 
Supervisor Ed Edelman to reconsider the legality of a large, lighted cross that 
was re-erected on county land in Cahuenga Pass in December. 
</P>
<P>
 Atheists United was formed in the winter of 1982-83 by breakaway members of 
American Atheists, a Texas-based group founded by O'Hair, following a dispute 
over tactics. The Los Angeles chapter, which objected to Nativity displays on 
parkland owned by the city of Santa Monica, had accepted a compromise that 
permitted the atheist group to add its own display in Palisades Park. 
</P>
<P>
 After O'Hair strongly criticized them for accepting such a deal, the chapter 
officers resigned and the formation of Atheists United was announced in May, 
1982, with Bonnell as its first president. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates of atheism nationally are still struggling to get out from under the 
long shadow of O'Hair, the country's best-known atheist because of her suit 
leading to the 1962 U.S. Supreme Court decision to ban devotional Bible 
readings in public schools. Her fiery pronouncements against religious belief, 
and her quarrels with friends and foes alike often land her in the headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Now 75, she comes to the American Atheists office each day in Austin but her 
health and age limit her activity, said a son, Jon Garth Murray, president of 
American Atheists. Another son, William Murray, converted to Christianity and 
became an outspoken advocate of religion, estranging himself from his mother. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 After American Atheists closed down its dwindling network of chapters at the 
end of 1992, more than half a dozen surviving groups in as many U.S. cities 
formed Atheist Alliance, which will meet next April 14-16 at the Beverly 
Garland Hotel in Studio City. 
</P>
<P>
 O'Hair has taunted other nonbelievers to "come out of the closet" and declare 
themselves atheists rather than calling themselves agnostics, freethinkers or 
humanists. 
</P>
<P>
 But Atheists United exchanges information in the Los Angeles area with groups 
such as Humanistic Judaism, Secular Humanists, Ethical Culture and the Gay & 
Lesbian Humanists and Atheists group through a loose regional alliance. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's all a matter of degree (of unbelief)," Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel that religious people don't have a monopoly on ethics," she said. 
"Secular people are just as concerned about ethics and values as religious 
people are."

 CRUSADE FIGURES: The San Fernando Valley crusade by Luis Palau, which ended 
Sunday, saw 1,442 people make "decisions for Christ," either recommitments of 
faith or first-time professions, during five rallies that drew 45,100 people to 
the Birmingham High School football field in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 Crusade officials also said that $403,000 in donations was raised to meet the 
budget established by the local organizing committee of business leaders and 
pastors. 
</P>
<P>
 The crowd totals and number of decisions slightly exceeded those at Palau's 
previous major U.S. crusade, held in 1993 in Fort Worth. But the Valley totals 
were below results in Phoenix and San Antonio the two previous years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, crusade leaders said the number of volunteers from Valley-area 
churches exceeded the turnout in the other three cities, although the quantity 
of supporting congregations was higher in Fort Worth, Phoenix and San Antonio. 
</P>
<P>
 Counting auxiliary events -- including a Latino rally, two luncheons and a 
children's rally -- the total attendance was 54,025, with 2,175 decisions, 
spokesmen said. 
</P>
<P>
 CATHOLIC AWARD: The National Catholic Register, a weekly newspaper edited in 
Encino, won first place in the general excellence category for national 
Catholic newspapers at the recent Catholic Press Assn. meeting in Tampa, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
 The Register, whose editor is Joop Koopman, beat out Our Sunday Visitor 
(second place), Catholic New Times, Toronto (third place) and the National 
Catholic Reporter (honorable mention). 
</P>
<P>
 AWARDS LUNCHEON: The Rev. Louis B. Gebhardt, a former senior pastor at First 
Congregational Church of Los Angeles who currently serves a church in Fresno, 
will speak at the Clergy Network awards luncheon Thursday at the Marriott Hotel 
in Woodland Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Gebhardt is chairman of the executive committee of the National Assn. of 
Congregational Christian Churches. 
</P>
<P>
 The noon luncheon will honor Los Angeles County Sheriff Sherman Block, 
publisher-philanthropist Jane Boeckmann, Mother Rosa Broadous of Pacoima's 
Calvary Baptist Church and the Rev. Karl Kniseley, president of UniHealth 
America Foundation. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call (800) 707-2224. 
</P>
<P>
 SENIOR JOBS: Unemployed and underemployed San Fernando Valley residents 50 and 
older are being invited to sign up for training programs, counseling services 
and job placement resources at an opportunities fair from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m. 
Friday at St. Andrew's Lutheran Church in Van Nuys. 
</P>
<P>
 "One in every five people over age 50 live close to poverty . . . but many 
lack the skills to compete in today's job market," said Sally James, executive 
director of Career Encores. 
</P>
<P>
 The fair at the church, 15520 Sherman Way, is one of three sponsored by a 
grant from Food for All, a nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 There is no charge, but space is limited, sponsors said. Call Career Encores 
at (818) 842-7507 for reservations and information. 
</P>
<P>
 BROADWAY MUSIC: Songs from "The Sound of Music," "Oliver" and "Showboat" will 
be featured in concert at 7 p.m. Sunday at Northridge United Methodist Church, 
9650 Reseda Blvd. 
</P>
<P>
 Admission is $8 for adults and $4 for children to benefit the church's music 
ministry. 
</P>
<P>
 KLEZMER BAND: The five-member Ellis Island Klezmer Band will perform 4 p.m. 
Sunday at Valley Beth Israel, 13060 Roscoe Blvd., Sun Valley, as a part of the 
Jewish Cultural Series sponsored by three San Fernando Valley synagogues.

VALENCIA LIBRARY OPENS NEW CHAPTER WITH BOOKMOBILE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Some library services will resume next week in Valencia, which has been 
without a public library since the Jan. 17 Northridge earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A bookmobile will begin operating near the earthquake-damaged building and a 
storytelling series for children will be offered at a mall. 
</P>
<P>
 Library branches are open in Newhall and Canyon Country, according to Josefina 
Reyes, community library manager for the Valencia branch, but they are not 
convenient for all residents. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we wanted some presence in this community," Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
 The bookmobile, stocked with about 3,000 books, will be open from 10 a.m. to 4 
p.m. Thursdays and Fridays in the courtyard adjacent to the library at 23743 
Valencia Blvd. It will also make available a small selection of cassettes and 
compact discs. 
</P>

 Story times for children 3 to 5 years old will be offered weekly starting 
Monday at 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. at the Valencia Town Center, 24201 Valencia Blvd. 
The free story readings, one of the library's most popular activities before 
the earthquake, also include songs and crafts. No advance registration is 
required and parents are free to remain during the 45- to 60-minute program.

<P>
 The 24,000-square-foot Valencia library, which was the busiest of the county's 
87 facilities, is expected to remain closed until the end of the year while 
repairs are completed, Reyes said. A water pipe burst in the library during the 
earthquake, flooding the building and damaging about one-fourth of the 155,000 
publications. 
</P>
<P>
 Crews also had to remove most of the building's internal fixtures so asbestos 
could be removed from the ceiling.

 Golf fans planning to buy souvenirs during next week's U.S. Open at Oakmont, 
Pa., are advised to bring plenty of cash or their credit cards. 
</P>
<P>
 The $50-a-day admission price is only a start. A sample of current prices in 
the Oakmont Country Club souvenir shop: posters are $10, a hip flask bearing 
the U.S. Open logo $50, a limited-edition stuffed bear $175, baby shoes $22 and 
a baby's bathrobe $30. 
</P>
<P>
 T-shirt and sweat shirt prices start in the $30 range and reach $60. Even fans 
who bring a bankroll won't get a break as souvenir money clips cost $25. 
</P>
<P>
 Trivia time: Which team holds the record for most points in an NBA finals 
game? 
</P>
<P>
 Not so fast, Ken: ESPN's Joe Morgan, on Ken Griffey Jr.'s home run hitting: 
"If he hits 61 at 24, he'll never live that down. People will expect him to hit 
that every year.  
</P>
<P>
 "I hope he hits 50-something and has a great season. I would hope he doesn't 
challenge 61. Look what it did to Roger Maris." 
</P>
<P>
 Ulcer time: Richard Justice of the Washington Post writes that Baltimore 
Manager Johnny Oates is under considerable pressure even though the Orioles are 
in third place in the American League East: 
</P>
<P>
 "Once one of the easiest places to manage, Baltimore has become a tough 
baseball town, and Oates has been blistered on the city's three baseball talk 
shows and, at times, skewered in the newspapers.  
</P>
<P>
 "He also has a new activist owner, Peter G. Angelos, who expects immediate 
results and seems to have an itchy trigger finger." 
</P>
<P>
 Easy for him to say: Even before he knew which team the Rockets would play in 
the NBA finals, Houston owner Les Alexander was extremely confident. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, we'll play the Knicks," Alexander said. "But we'll beat anybody we 
play. We're the best team in the NBA by far." 
</P>
<P>
 Boo-hoo: Dan Shaughnessy of the Boston Globe, on the old Boston Garden's being 
replaced by a new building: 
</P>
<P>
 "Sad, isn't it? Doesn't the thought of seeing the last rat in the rafters kind 
of put a lump in your throat?" 
</P>
<P>
 Eat at Joe's: Jockeys in New York may soon resemble mounted billboards.  
</P>
<P>
 A bill has been passed that would allow the riders to be the first in the 
nation to wear ads on their clothing.  
</P>
<P>
 Assemblyman Bobby D'Andrea of Saratoga Springs, home of Saratoga Race Course, 
said allowing such ads would diminish some of the track's charm that endears it 
to so many racing fans. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking back: On this day in 1919, Sir Barton, ridden by Johnny Loftus, became 
the first thoroughbred to win the Triple Crown by winning the Belmont Stakes.

MAGRANE FAILS, ANGELS LOSE; BASEBALL: AFTER GOOD OUTING SUNDAY, LEFT-HANDER 
FIZZLES AND TIGERS WIN, 8-4. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ELLIOTT TEAFORD, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Today's assignment, Angel fans, is to compare and contrast. The subject is 
left-hander Joe Magrane, the losing pitcher in the Angels' 8-4 loss to Detroit 
Friday night at Anaheim Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 In his last start Sunday, Magrane was superb. Friday, he was not. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he gave up one run and four hits in his first complete game in four 
years. Friday, he gave up four runs and six hits with three walks, three 
strikeouts, three wild pitches and one hit batter. He didn't make it past the 
fifth inning. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, he dazzled the Milwaukee Brewers with a firm command of his pitches. 
Friday, he couldn't contain the Tigers, who homered for the 17th consecutive 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumping all the blame for this loss on Magrane, 2-3 with a 6.57 earned-run 
average, wouldn't be fair. This was only his seventh start since returning from 
elbow surgery Feb. 8. Besides, there were plenty of other reasons why the 
Angels lost for the sixth time in eight games on this 10-game home stand. 
</P>
<P>
 But inconsistent pitching continues to overshadow all other Angel problems. 
Five wild pitches -- relievers Mark Leiter and Mike Butcher had the other two 
-- stand out. 
</P>
<P>
 Magrane said he's not going to stop throwing breaking pitches into the lower 
portion of the strike zone simply because he had one rough night. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've gotten a lot of guys out that way," he said. "In the past, I've gotten a 
lot of swinging strikeouts on those pitches. I'm certainly not going to deviate 
from that now. It's what I've been taught, what I've had the most success doing 
and where I'm going to continue to pitch." 
</P>
<P>
 Concerns would appear to be mounting for the listless Angels, who managed only 
seven hits against Detroit pitching Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 So what is it going to take pull the Angels out of their slide? Manager Marcel 
Lachemann ticked off the answers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have to have a well-pitched game for one thing," he said. "We need to do 
all the little things right. We need to get runners on and we need to advance 
them. We need to get timely hitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get the feeling we should be doing better than we are. I think this team is 
better than this. I really do." Magrane agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "I do think we should be doing better," he said. "We're not the type of team 
that can rely on our offense like the Tigers. We're going to have to pitch well 
and hit well at the same time." 
</P>
<P>
 Lachemann said he's not a fan of team meetings and doesn't imagine holding 
court in an attempt to snap the Angels out of their funk. He prefers to handle 
things in a one-on-one setting. 
</P>
<P>
 "Meetings have their time and place, but it's like anything else," said 
Lachemann, who did hold a meeting when the club was in Toronto in late May. "If 
you're talking all the time, nobody will listen. I would rather deal with 
individuals. I will get (angry) once in a while and I wouldn't want my wife and 
kids around when I do. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes quite a bit to get that far with me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels are 3-10 in the 13 games since Magrane defeated Detroit and starter 
Mike Moore May 26 in Tiger Stadium. They are 2-7 in June, 8-12 under Lachemann 
and have fallen to a season-high 6 1/2 games behind American League 
West-leading Texas. 
</P>
<P>
 And the question is whether that's enough to send Lachemann into a fit of 
anger? 
</P>
<P>
 Certainly, nothing could save Magrane from himself Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 He left trailing, 4-2. Travis Fryman's two-run home run to left field in the 
fifth inning gave the Tigers the lead for good. 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the fifth, Magrane had thrown 109 lackluster pitches and 
Lachemann believed that was plenty, summoning Leiter to start the sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish my command would have been a little better," Magrane said. "If Fryman 
doesn't hit that home run, who knows? It might have been a different ballgame. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a couple of pitches where I could have made better pitches. Being 
behind, 3-0, to Fryman I didn't want to walk him. I wanted to make him hit it." 
</P>
<P>
 And so Fryman did, sending Magrane and the Angels reeling.

FREAK KNEE INJURY SIDELINES MARINOVICH; FOOTBALL: FORMER USC, RAIDER 
QUARTERBACK SUFFERS MAJOR LIGAMENT DAMAGE ON FIRST DAY OF CFL CAMP. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS BAKER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Marinovich's turbulent football career received another setback Friday 
when the former USC and Raider quarterback suffered a serious injury to his 
left knee on the opening day of training camp with his new team, the Winnipeg 
Blue Bombers of the Canadian Football League. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm devastated," said Marinovich, who had never suffered a serious injury 
before Friday. "You never think it's going to happen to you." 
</P>
<P>
 Marinovich, hoping to get a fresh start with the CFL team after being waived 
by the Raiders last summer, damaged his left anterior cruciate ligament when 
his leg crumpled after his cleats stuck on a well-groomed grass field during a 
drop-back passing drill at Brandon, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury could seriously affect Marinovich's career because he's left-handed 
and must plant the knee for stability while throwing. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was in immense pain," said sportswriter Dave Supleve of the Winnipeg Free 
Press, who saw the accident. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was half tragic and half ironic. It was freakish. They had just opened 
full training camp this morning and on the very first play, it's not even a 
play, it's just a drill where they drop back and turn their shoulders, he blew 
out his knee. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was like Stephen King wrote it. They had done their stretch, and the first 
drill for the quarterbacks was the five step drop where you drop three steps, 
turn your shoulders and drop back two more. I almost had to act it out in my 
hotel room to do it. And as he turned his shoulders, his left leg got stuck in 
the turf." 
</P>
<P>
 Winnipeg quarterback coach/offensive coordinator Mike Kelly initially had 
trouble grasping the severity of Marinovich's injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was freakish," Kelly said. "At first I said, 'You're kidding, right?' and 
then I looked at his eyes and I knew he wasn't. It's just one of those bizarre 
things that happens. The quarterbacks tiptoed around all day after that." 
</P>
<P>
 Marinovich could be out for up to a year if his injury requires full 
reconstructive surgery and rehabilitation. Blue Bomber team physician A.E. 
Longstaffe, who examined him Friday in Winnipeg, is scheduled to perform 
arthroscopic surgery Monday to determine the full extent of the injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Marinovich said he isn't sure whether he'll undergo his rehabilitation in 
Canada or in the Southland under the direction of his father, Marv. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his college and pro careers have been plagued by obstacles, 
Marinovich, who signed a two-year contract with Winnipeg last month, hopes to 
overcome his latest challenge. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything was going well," he said. "I couldn't have been happier. But like 
I said, you never know when something like this is going to happen. All I can 
do is work with the doctors and rehab." 
</P>
<P>
 Although Marinovich hadn't played organized football since being cut from the 
Raiders last August, Kelly said he performed well in workouts before camp 
opened. 
</P>
<P>
 "He really looked good in rookie camp," Kelly said. "He was really starting to 
come into his own after the layoff."

WORLD CUP '94 / 6 DAYS AND COUNTING; HIS KIND OF TOWN; HARKES IS ONE OF THREE 
ON U.S. NATIONAL TEAM FROM SOCCER-MAD KEARNY, N.J. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Amazing Grace, how sweet the sound, especially when played by the United 
Gaelic and Sean McGonigol Pipe Band. All of the band members, most of whom are 
bagpipers, were wearing kilts, except for one of the drummers, Tony Meola. "We 
let him stand in occasionally," a band member said of the Italian-American 
goalkeeper for the U.S. soccer team, "but we call him Tony (Mike) Meola." 
</P>
<P>
 An overflow crowd of about 350 had gathered in the dining hall of the 
Scots-American Club one night late last month to honor the U.S. players, 
especially those who were raised on the playing fields of Kearny. 
</P>
<P>
 It might seem extraordinary that three members of the United States' 22-man 
roster for the World Cup can trace their soccer roots back to this town of 
35,785, but not to those who live here -- on the bank where the Passaic and 
Hackensack rivers merge, a goal kick from Newark. 
</P>
<P>
 Upon entering the city limits at either end of Kearny Avenue, one cannot fail 
to see the signs that proclaim Kearny: "Soccer Town, U.S.A., Home of Tony 
Meola, John Harkes and Tab Ramos." 
</P>
<P>
 This has been a soccer town for more than 100 years. Two members of the United 
States' first World Cup team in 1930 were from Kearny, and so many other 
college, semipro and professional players have passed through here before and 
since that both of the town's libraries are displaying exhibits centered around 
the town's soccer heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 To read the names of players past and present is to understand Kearny's 
changing demographics. All Scottish and Irish in the beginning, they were 
joined later by Italians and Portuguese and, more recently, Latin Americans. 
</P>
<P>
 Like virtually everywhere else in the United States, multiculturalism has not 
been embraced by all of the townspeople. But the goal is closer here than in 
many places because of one passion shared by all of the cultures, soccer. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I was growing up, we played soccer every single day," Harkes said. "If 
the fields were being used, we played in the street. It wasn't until I was 
older and began traveling to other towns to play that I realized that not all 
kids in America were doing the same thing. They were playing baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes spoke a couple of weeks after the celebration at the Scots-American 
Club, which he missed because he was still engaged with his professional team 
in England's First Division, Derby County.  
</P>
<P>
 But he is omnipresent in the Scots-American Club. The walls in the bar 
downstairs, papered with plaid, are covered with soccer pictures, most of them 
of Harkes. Although Meola's heritage is Italian and Ramos' is Uruguayan, they 
are loved like sons in the Scots-American Club, but there is an even more 
special feeling among the members for Harkes because he, the son of a Scotsman, 
is a link to their forefathers. 
</P>
<P>
 When the Coats & Clark Thread Company established a mill along the Passaic 
River in 1890, the Scottish owners recruited skilled workers from among their 
countrymen by offering free passage and six-year contracts to come to New 
Jersey. Many more Scots and Irish soon followed, either to work for the other 
textile mills opening in the area or for the giant Congoleum Niarm linoleum 
factory. 
</P>
<P>
 As the story is told today at the Scots-American Club, the Thistle Football 
Club signed potential players right off the boats from Scotland and Ireland, 
and it was not long before there were enough teams for a healthy league. 
</P>
<P>
 Particularly competitive were the teams sponsored by the mill owners, whose 
stars are said to have seldom seen the insides of the mills. With businesses 
closed because of the state's blue laws, the Sunday afternoon games were well 
attended as people in the area had little else to occupy their time after 
church. 
</P>
<P>
 The mills have long since shut down, but the Scottish influence upon the town 
remains as thick as the accent that still prevails in the pubs and 
fish-and-chips shops, in the markets whose butchers supply meat pies to the 
British Embassy in Washington, and of course, in the Scots-American Club. 
</P>
<P>
 It was that ambience that attracted young Jimmy Harkes to Kearny in 1961. A 
better-than-average player in his native Dundee, he had a couple of tryouts 
with professional teams before giving up and joining the British Army, which 
assigned him to its soccer team that toured the world.  
</P>
<P>
 Upon returning to Dundee, he found that his services as a carpenter were not 
in demand, convincing him to accept an invitation from his sister to move to 
Detroit. He soon ventured to New York, where he was told that he might find a 
home away from home in Kearny. 
</P>
<P>
 He settled into carpentry, married a woman from Scotland and had three 
children, and although he continued to play soccer in the semipro league on 
weekends, he soon discovered that his passion was in watching, and sometimes 
coaching, his two boys, Jim and John. 
</P>
<P>
 When he took Jim to sign up for an 8-and-under league, John, only 4 1/2, 
insisted that he be allowed to join. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father said that I was too little, but I grabbed a shirt and went on the 
field," John said. "He said, 'OK, if that's the way you want it, but you'll 
have to work harder than everyone else.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That was no challenge for John. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without question, he was far and away the most dedicated young player I've 
ever seen," said Hugh O'Neill, a Kearny native who played professionally in the 
North American Soccer League. "He had an old head on young shoulders." 
</P>
<P>
 John Harkes played on a Kearny High team that compiled an 86-6 record and 
played in four consecutive state championship games, the final two years with 
Meola as a teammate, earning Harkes a scholarship to the University of 
Virginia, where he was the Missouri Athletic Club's player of the year in 1987. 
That also was the year he made his debut with the national team. 
</P>
<P>
 After playing in the 1990 World Cup, he jeopardized his status as local hero 
among at least half of Kearny's Scottish population by trying out for one of 
Glasgow's famous teams, Celtic. That is the Catholic team. As Protestants, most 
of the Harkes family friends have allegiances to the other Glasgow team, 
Rangers. 
</P>
<P>
 "My father was getting a lot of stick at the club," Harkes said. "When I told 
him I wasn't going to stay in Scotland, he was relieved. They take these things 
seriously in Kearny." 
</P>
<P>
 Harkes went south, where he has established himself in the English League -- 
first with Sheffield Wednesday and now with Derby County. While it is the dream 
of English players to take part in a game on soccer's most hallowed ground, the 
field at London's Wembley Stadium, most never make it there. Harkes has done it 
six times, making everyone at the Scots-American Club -- Catholics and 
Protestants alike -- proud. World Cup Player at a Glance

BRAVE ULISES LOOMS AS SPOILER; BELMONT STAKES: THE LONGSHOT SPRINTER MIGHT PUT 
EXTRA PRESSURE ON KENTUCKY DERBY WINNER GO FOR GIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL CHRISTINE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the hours wind down for today's 126th Belmont Stakes, there has been a 
curious development: The Ulises factor is upstaging the Lasix factor. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lasix factor is part of the Belmont any time horses with pulmonary 
bleeding problems run in the race, because New York's racing rules prohibit use 
of the diuretic, which is permitted for other races, including the Kentucky 
Derby and the Preakness. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the favorites in today's seven-horse Belmont -- Preakness winner 
Tabasco Cat, Santa Anita Derby winner Brocco and Strodes Creek -- have run with 
Lasix, and while their trainers don't think racing drug-free will affect their 
performances, bettors are not entirely convinced. 
</P>
<P>
 A bigger concern has been the nagging presence of Ulises, the sprinter from 
Panama who has been unable to last a longer distance in three starts in the 
United States. After Robert Perez, owner of the colt, announced Monday that 
Ulises would be a Belmont starter, one horseman said: "I don't know what the 
odds on the other horses will be, but I'm making Ulises 1-20 to finish last." 
</P>
<P>
 Undefeated in four sprints in Panama, Ulises was a well-beaten third in the 
Lexington Stakes at Keeneland in late April, then balked at being loaded into 
the gate for the Kentucky Derby, contributing to an awkward start for half the 
field, including the favorites, Holy Bull and Brocco. Ulises was the last of 14 
horses to hit the wire at Louisville, beaten by 35 1/4 lengths 
</P>
<P>
 Perez and his trainer, Alfredo Callejas, didn't run Ulises in the Preakness 
two weeks later, much to the relief of trainers in that race. Instead, Ulises 
showed up on May 29 for the Peter Pan at Belmont. He was a factor for six 
furlongs, but everyone ran past him in the stretch, and after 1 1/8 miles, he 
was last in a field of five, losing by 14 3/4 lengths. 
</P>
<P>
 If Ulises runs a comparable race in the 1 1/2-mile Belmont, he will be out 
front with Go For Gin, the Kentucky Derby winner, for a few furlongs and then 
start fading rapidly. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he hurts anybody, it might be Strodes Creek more than the rest of us," 
said Wayne Lukas, who trains Tabasco Cat. "Strodes Creek comes from farther out 
of it than the rest of us, and that other horse might get in his way." 
</P>
<P>
 It would be an easier Belmont for Go For Gin if he could grab an uncontested 
lead and slow the early pace. "The fractions," Lukas said, "have more to do 
with the winning of this race than a horse's pedigree." 
</P>
<P>
 Go For Gin's trainer, Nick Zito, said of Ulises: "Maybe the Triple Crown ought 
to have a qualifying system for these races. Maybe important races won and 
points for winning them could be considered. But maybe that wouldn't work, 
either. You might eliminate a lot of horses and wind up with small fields." 
</P>
<P>
 The best thing that can be said about Ulises, who at 30-1 is the longest price 
on the morning line, is that his sire, Temperence Hill, won a Belmont he wasn't 
supposed to. In 1980, rain turned the track into a muddy mess, and Joe Canty 
was the only trainer in the race who ran his horse with mud caulks. Temperence 
Hill beat the Kentucky Derby-winning filly, Genuine Risk, by two lengths and 
paid $108.80. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1982, Perez's speedy filly, Cupecoy's Joy, ran 10th in the Kentucky Derby 
after leading the race to the quarter pole. Perez entered Cupecoy's Joy in the 
Preakness, but when he and his party were given a run-around in the dining room 
at Pimlico, he scratched Cupecoy's Joy and put her on a van for Belmont Park. 
Racing in her own division, Cupecoy's Joy won two of the three legs of New 
York's filly triple crown. 
</P>
<P>
 Ulises will be blindfolded by assistant starters at loading time today, the 
theory being that the colt won't resist what he can't see. "The horse is doing 
good," Perez said. "He worked five furlongs earlier in the week in 1:01 3/5 
with Jerry Bailey. Jerry (who rode Ulises for the first time in the Peter Pan) 
said he liked him, so we decided to go in the Belmont." 
</P>
<P>
 But Bailey will not be riding Ulises today. When Eddie Delahoussaye, who has 
been battling a virus, said Tuesday that he would be unable to ride Strodes 
Creek, trainer Charlie Whittingham hired Bailey. Craig Perret, who rode Ulises 
in his U.S. debut, has the assignment for Perez in the Belmont. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey's taking over on Strodes Creek is merely another chapter in his 
shifting Triple Crown season. He started the year as Go For Gin's regular 
jockey, and even though they won three stakes together, Bailey got off Zito's 
colt after Irgun outfinished him in the Wood Memorial in mid-April. Bailey was 
supposed to ride Irgun in the Kentucky Derby, but that colt was injured. Bailey 
then rode Blumin Affair to third place at Churchill Downs. 
</P>
<P>
 Bailey won the 1991 Belmont with Hansel, beating Zito's Strike The Gold by a 
head after a dramatic stretch drive. The 36-year-old, New York-based rider 
ranks eighth nationally this year with $3.7 million in purses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Delahoussaye must have eaten the same chicken that I did," said Whittingham, 
who says that he suffered a minor case of food poisoning here a week ago. 
"We'll be all right with Bailey. He's worked the horse four times here. And he 
knows this track better than the California riders."

IN A FIERY RELATIONSHIP, RISON'S GIRLFRIEND SURRENDERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Hip-hop performer Lisa (Left Eye) Lopes surrendered to police Friday on 
charges that she set fire to the two-story mansion belonging to her boyfriend, 
Atlanta Falcon receiver Andre Rison, and smashed his cars. 
</P>
<P>
 Lopes, 22, a singer with the group TLC, is accused of felony arson and 
criminal damage to property.The house was destroyed in the Thursday blaze. 
</P>
<P>
 Court officials said Lopes waived her right to a hearing in Fulton County 
magistrate's court that had been scheduled for Monday. It was unclear when the 
singer, whose nickname comes from her habit of replacing one lens of her 
glasses with a condom during performances, would appear in court. 
</P>
<P>
 Magistrate Vickie Moran set bond at $500,000 on the arson charge and $10,000 
on a criminal damage charge. Lopes also is accused of smashing Rison's cars. 
The bond was later reduced to $82,000, which Lopes posted. 
</P>
<P>
 Police also said they would charge Lopes with a misdemeanor drug charge 
because of marijuana found in the burned-out home. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said an enraged Lopes set fire to cardboard in a whirlpool tub at the 
mansion around 6:30 a.m. Thursday after Rison and a group of friends returned 
from being out all night. 
</P>
<P>
 Rison said Lopes had been hitting him on the head that morning and he slapped 
her to get her to stop. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's when I went for a walk, before it went any further," he told WAGA-TV. 
"She's a beautiful person. . . . But I think there's something wrong with her 
mental state. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm in her corner. I'm going to go to bat for her." 
</P>
<P>
 Rison has had previous troubles with Lopes. Last September, he was arrested in 
a grocery parking lot after allegedly hitting Lopes and firing a handgun. The 
charges were later dismissed.

 The U.S. soccer team is still on a two-workouts-a-day training schedule, and 
the players are using this break from competition to allow injuries to heal. 
</P>
<P>
 Midfielder Claudio Reyna suffered a strained right hamstring Wednesday and 
will be unable to practice until early next week.Trainer Rudy Rudawsky said 
Reyna has full range of motion and little pain and should be ready to play in 
the team's World Cup opener against Switzerland on June 18 at Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 "The best thing is he's young and he will bounce right back," Rudawsky said. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas Dooley did not work out Friday because of a slight muscle cramp, Kle 
Cooiman practiced lightly after sitting out a few days because of tendinitis in 
a knee and Eric Wynalda is still recovering from a throat infection. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. Coach Bora Milutinovic, asked what was the most important thing for the 
team to do between now and the game against the Swiss, said: "No injuries."

 A two-year, $2-million experiment to play World Cup soccer indoors moved into 
its final phase as workers began installing grass inside the Silverdome in 
Pontiac, Mich. 
</P>
<P>
 The June 18 game between the United States and Switzerland will mark the first 
time World Cup soccer has been played indoors. The grass installation is 
expected to be completed today, one week before the first of four games to be 
played over 11 days.

 Hundreds of Romanian soccer fans wanting to travel to the World Cup have 
failed to qualify for a U.S. tourist visa, officials in Bucharest said. The 
news followed Thursday's disclosure that many Bulgarian fans had suffered a 
similar fate. 
</P>
<P>
 Immigration officials at the U.S. embassy in Bucharest were not immediately 
available for comment, but U.S. embassy sources put the refusal rate over the 
last few months at 50%. Immigration services in the former communist state are 
said to be closely checking visa applications to thwart possible 
asylum-seekers. 
</P>

 In Washington, a State Department spokesman said all countries were generally 
treated the same way.

 The United States relaxed a flight ban against Nigeria Airways to help the 
African country's soccer team and more than 1,000 fans attend the World Cup. 
The ban was ordered last year because of lax security at Nigeria's Lagos 
International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 All flights covered by the relaxation must land before crossing the Atlantic 
at Dakar, Senegal, "for 100% security screening" under U.S. government 
supervision," the announcement by the U.S. Transportation Department said. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Lagos Airport has been criticized for corruption, thievery and 
insecurity, the ban also has been seen as political. It came while the United 
States and the European Community were introducing limited sanctions against 
Nigeria's military government because Gen. Ibrahim Babangida annulled June 12 
presidential elections that were to end a decade of military rule.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; BOWE HITS POTHOLES ON ROAD BACK TO TITLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Not so long ago, a big man in a small gym shouted as he worked. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm the best in the world at what I do," Riddick Bowe screamed at his smaller 
sparring partner while jostling him around the ring. "Want to know why?" 
</P>
<P>
 On cue, Bowe surged forward, slamming his left jab into Garing Lane's face and 
pouncing on his wobbling foe with two quick hooks, a left and a right, that 
sent him staggering. Bowe's voice grew even louder. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am the real champion!" Bowe boomed. "Won't be long now." 
</P>
<P>
 After the workout, as the former heavyweight champion of the world strolled 
past a reporter, Bowe barked: "See. See? Just a matter of time before I'm champ 
again. Just a matter of time." 
</P>
<P>
 And at that moment about a month ago, with that hard-bitten look, those 
blazing hands and that 255-pound body, who could argue with him? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe was supposed to have begun his quest to regain his championship tonight 
at Caesars Palace in Las Vegas, site of his last fight -- a loss to Evander 
Holyfield in November. 
</P>
<P>
 Light-hitting Buster Mathis Jr. was not supposed to be a battle, only the 
first leg of the 26-year-old Bowe's comeback journey. The second was scheduled 
for July 15 at Hollywood Park against Larry Donald. A third, against an 
opponent not yet chosen, was set for August. All would be televised by HBO. 
Bowe was to receive millions, keep his name in the paper and showcase the 
skills that led him to the title in November of 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 But last Saturday, the Mathis bout was canceled and the other two fights were 
thrown into limbo when Bowe was ordered by doctors to stop all physical 
activity after suffering back spasms. 
</P>
<P>
 What now? This setback, on the heels of his cancellation of a February bout 
because of a cut, came as Bowe's hunger for redemption at last seemed to 
outweigh his appetite for fatty foods and sweet thoughts of a wealthy 
retirement. 
</P>
<P>
 Rock Newman, Bowe's manager, said the only way the fighter and his people can 
approach this run of misfortune -- the loss in November, the two scrapped 
fights -- is accepting that what does not kill a former heavyweight champion 
can only make him stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of good things have happened for us," Newman said. "But now, we're sort 
of hitting our share of bumps in the road. What I've tried to explain to 
Riddick is that coping with injuries is part of this business, just like 
learning to duck a hook." 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe was scheduled to see a doctor Friday morning, and if he gets the medical 
OK, could return to training as soon as Monday, trainer Eddie Futch said. 
</P>
<P>
 Assuming a clean bill of health -- and Newman said Bowe, after a lot of rest, 
has been feeling much better -- Newman plans to keep the July 15 date but 
perhaps switch Mathis for Donald and move the Donald bout to August. 
</P>
<P>
 This is a scenario that probably is not agreeable to the Donald camp, which 
has been hoping to draw an uninterested, thick Bowe into the ring. Getting Bowe 
in his first fight since last November, instead of his second, makes their 
chances stronger. 
</P>
<P>
 There are already rumbles that this is a concocted injury, that Bowe and 
Newman want to avoid Donald, who won his 15th consecutive fight last week and 
is a tall, talented boxer. 
</P>
<P>
 "Riddick has been through some wars with the likes of Evander Holyfield," 
Newman said. "Let me tell you: Larry Donald is not exactly the kind of guy who 
makes us shake in our boots. If we were ever going to do any avoiding, it would 
be with somebody else, not Larry Donald." 
</P>
<P>
 Futch said: "Doesn't matter to me. Mathis or Donald, if Riddick is in shape, 
he'll handle either one." 
</P>
<P>
 But these are all only scenarios, those around Bowe concede. With someone as 
prone to eating binges and slackening work habits as Bowe, the only important 
issue is where his mind is. 
</P>
<P>
 Bowe went to his Big Bear camp in early May still in a kind of gentle limbo, 
not quite dedicated to furious work but not quite ready to give up hopes of 
regaining the titles. 
</P>
<P>
 His wife, Judith, had just given birth to a son, Julius; he was building his 
dream house in the Washington suburbs, and he had millions in the bank from his 
championship tenure. 
</P>
<P>
 He weighed about 270 pounds. He was sluggish. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, in the span of a few days, he was angry, spitting out his fury and 
training the way he had trained before first winning a title. 
</P>
<P>
 What happened? He watched Michael Moorer barely hang on to defeat Holyfield on 
April 22, in a victory further dampened by the discovery that Holyfield was 
suffering from a congenital heart problem -- and Bowe knew his size, his long 
left jab and his quick hands would be effective against the smaller, 
left-handed Moorer. 
</P>
<P>
 Then Bowe watched his nemesis, Lennox Lewis, retain the World Boxing Council 
title in an awkward knockout of journeyman Phil Jackson on May 6, and Bowe knew 
that the heavyweight division was crying out for him. 
</P>
<P>
 "I could whup Moorer and Lennox, both of those guys, in one night," Bowe said 
at camp. "Oh, I miss being champion more than anything in the world. That's why 
the desire is here. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know, I could be home with my newborn son. He was born on a Tuesday and I 
left on Sunday. But I'm here sacrificing and once again trying to prove to the 
world that I'm the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Then came the cancellation. 
</P>
<P>
 These summer fights were designed to round Bowe into shape, both mentally and 
physically, for a title shot either late this year or in early 1995. Already, 
Moorer's people are considering a Bowe fight for next spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Will a once-beaten, twice-canceled Bowe be ready to take advantage of the 
opportunity? 
</P>
<P>
 Futch, for one, said the hard moments seem to have made his fighter want the 
title more. 
</P>
<P>
 "Before he left to go home to D.C., he made a point to come and sit in my room 
and say, 'We're going to do it again just like we did it before,' " Futch said. 
</P>
<P>
 "For him to come and volunteer that attitude, that made me feel the guy is 
ready. And he will be ready again. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has become very clear to him: This is what he's all about. Everything he 
is was built on him winning fights. Everything he's got is based on him being 
heavyweight champion of the world. 
</P>
<P>
 "He realizes that now in no uncertain terms." Calendar 
</P>

<P>
 After a postseason review of the program, USC is combining its men's and 
women's track and field teams and seeking a coach who will be in charge of 
both. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Allice, coach at Long Beach City College for 16 years, is a leading 
candidate for the Trojan job, and he said Friday he would be interested. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a difficult situation, because I have a good job here know both of the 
coaches at USC and they have done a good job," Allice said. "And I've never 
spoken to Mike Garrett (Trojan athletic director)." 
</P>
<P>
 Men's Coach Jim Bush and women's Coach Barbara Edmondson were told this week 
about the switch after a review by Daryl Gross, USC assistant athletic 
director. Both coaches have been told that they will be invited back next 
season as part of the track and field staff. JIM HODGES

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; DODGERS; WORRELL GETS VOTE OF SUPPORT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARYANN HUDSON 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Todd Worrell has converted only seven of 15 save opportunities since signing 
with the Dodgers before last season, but Fred Claire, the club's executive vice 
president, said he believes Worrell will turn things around. 
</P>
<P>
 "First, his health is good. He has good velocity and good breaking pitches," 
Claire said. "I think there needs to be more consideration to pitch selection. 
. . . I think he needs to change speeds a little bit." 
</P>
<P>
 Claire said he has no plans to make any more moves in the bullpen, hoping that 
the new call-ups from triple-A Albuquerque, Ismael Valdes and Rudy Seanez, will 
help the other relievers get back on track. 
</P>
<P>
 Seanez took a long route to get back to the Dodgers, who released him after 
the 1992 season after he had back and shoulder problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Valdes, 21, has made a fast jump, starting the season at double-A San Antonio, 
then pitching for Albuquerque and now the Dodgers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never got an apartment in Albuquerque. I lived in a hotel," he said. "And I 
will have a hotel room in L.A., but I don't care where I live." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pedro Astacio, who was relieved by Worrell during the ninth inning of 
Wednesday's game after Astacio walked the leadoff batter, was quoted by the El 
Nuevo Herald in Miami as saying he didn't agree with Manager Tom Lasorda's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the old man (Lasorda) is thinking, (but) since he's the one 
in charge, I have to continue doing what he asked me to do," Astacio said. 
"Today I pitched better than in my last two games, but this type of game is 
part of baseball, and there's nothing I can do about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Astacio left with a 4-2 lead, and the Marlins scored three runs against 
Worrell and Al Osuna to win the game. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Playing behind catcher Mike Piazza means barely playing at all, a frustrating 
fact for Carlos Hernandez, who said he asked Claire to trade him. "I talked to 
Fred when we were in San Francisco, and he told me to be patient and he would 
see what he could do at the end of the season," Hernandez said. "I never talked 
to Fred before, but I'm 27 years old and I want to prove that I can play -- I 
know I can play -- but I don't think I will ever get a chance to play here or 
have more opportunities to play." 
</P>
<P>
 Hernandez has appeared in only 10 of 60 games, starting seven. In the three 
consecutive starts he made when Piazza was sidelined, he batted .385 with two 
runs batted in. He is batting .296 overall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Raul Mondesi extended his hitting streak to 14 games; Eric Karros is at 13 
games. . . . Delino DeShields, who had hoped to return by next Monday, might be 
sidelined a few days longer. . . . Cub broadcaster Harry Caray crashed through 
a glass table in the visitors' clubhouse in Philadelphia this week, the Chicago 
Tribune reported. Caray was uninjured. MARYANN HUDSON

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; ANGELS; SPRINGER SAYS HE'S SOUND NOW

<TEXT>
<P>
 Russ Springer said he didn't get a fair chance with the Angels last season. 
But he also knows some of what transpired in 1993 was his fault.Springer, who 
will make his first major league start of the season tonight, acknowledged that 
he lied to the Angels about the severity of a back injury last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told them whenever I was hurting that I was OK because I wanted to pitch," 
said Springer, who was 1-6 with a 7.20 ERA before his season was cut short 
because of the back injury. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm healthy now for real. There's nothing wrong with my back whatsoever." 
</P>
<P>
 Springer won six of his last seven starts at triple-A Vancouver, had a 7-4 
record and 3.04 ERA. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 Tonight marks a full week back in the majors for first baseman J.T. Snow and 
he said he is following the advice Manager Marcel Lachemann gave him last 
Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He told me, 'We don't expect you to carry the team,' " Snow said. "I just get 
the feeling I can relax and play. I'd be lying if I said I wasn't putting any 
pressure on myself (last season)."

BASEBALL / DAILY REPORT; AROUND THE MAJORS; HAMILTON FINALLY FOLDS HIS SEASON

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Satisfied that his teammates were OK with his decision, Milwaukee Brewer 
outfielder Darryl Hamilton went on the disabled list to have season-ending 
surgery on his right elbow. 
</P>
<P>
 Hamilton, a lifetime .297 hitter, learned before the season that he had a bone 
spur and partially torn ligament in his right elbow that required 
reconstructive surgery. 
</P>
<P>
 He tried to play as long as possible until teammate Jody Reed advised him to 
have the operation. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think I've been going through this mode where I felt guilty," Hamilton 
said. "And I didn't just want to pick up a check every two weeks and not do 
something to earn it."

 Cincinnati left-hander John Smiley got a shot of cortisone in his pitching 
shoulder and probably will skip his next start.

TITANS WILL LOSE THEIR NUCLEUS BUT RETAIN A LOT OF TALENT; BASEBALL: SEVEN 
FULLERTON PLAYERS WERE PICKED IN AMATEUR DRAFT, BUT HORTON PRAISES THE ATHLETES 
WHO REMAIN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Cal State Fullerton made another strong run in the College World Series, its 
third appearance in the last five years, and it wouldn't surprise anyone close 
to college baseball to see the Titans return to Omaha, Neb., soon. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton, eliminated by Georgia Tech Wednesday night, 3-2, is expected to 
lose some top players to professional baseball, and several seniors have 
completed their eligibility. Some top talent, however, will be returning, and 
the Titans already have signed several highly regarded high school players. 
</P>
<P>
 "That type of tradition and success breeds success," said George Horton, Titan 
associate head coach. "Of course, there's always a danger that it can lead to 
complacency, too, but I don't think that's going to happen with us." 
</P>
<P>
 Seven Titans were picked in the amateur draft, including three juniors. 
Outfield Dante Powell, second baseman Jeff Ferguson and pitcher Mike Parisi 
indicated earlier in the season that they planned to sign pro contacts as 
juniors. The Giants picked Powell, who finished the season with a .305 batting 
average, in the first round. The Marlins picked Parisi in the sixth round and 
signed him Friday. The Twins picked Ferguson in the ninth round. 
</P>
<P>
 The seniors drafted were catcher Bret Hemphill, selected in the 14th round by 
the Angels; pitcher Chad Rolish, in the 19th by the Athletics; Jim Betzsold, in 
the 20th by the Indians, and first baseman Adam Millan, in the 28th by 
Phillies. 
</P>
<P>
 Pitcher Dan Ricabal, 4-0 in the postseason with two victories in Omaha, wasn't 
drafted but hopes he will have a chance in the pros. He finished 12-1 for the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sure someone at some point will say, 'Here's a plane ticket and come 
pitch for us,' " Ricabal said. "I'm not about to lose confidence in my ability 
to pitch on that level until I get home and the phone doesn't ring." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Titans will be losing some big names, several key underclassmen 
will be returning. 
</P>
<P>
 That group includes freshman outfielder Mark Kotsay, who had seven runs batted 
in and a grand slam in the Titans' 10-3 victory over Florida State. Kotsay, who 
also pitched during the season, was the team's leading hitter with a .372 
average, two percentage points higher than Ferguson. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortstop Jack Jones, another freshman, sparkled defensively throughout the 
season and had moments of timely hitting. First baseman D.C. Olsen, who was 
platooned and hit .277, also is expected back for his senior season. 
</P>
<P>
 Also returning are outfielder Jeremy Giambi, a redshirt freshman who hit .294 
while starting 37 games, along with top reserves Brian King (.256) and Robert 
Matos (.345). 
</P>
<P>
 The returning pitchers include sophomores Matt Wagner, 12-1 for the season, 
and closer Ted Silva, 4-4 with 13 saves. 
</P>
<P>
 Horton, who handles the pitchers for Coach Augie Garrido, also is optimistic 
that sophomore Jon Ward will develop into a top pitcher next season. Ward, used 
sparingly this season, was 0-2 with a 3.67 earned-run average. 
</P>
<P>
 "Jon was bothered by some knee and back problems, but I've already told him 
that we expect him to be one of our top arms next season," Horton said. Two 
other Titan pitchers, Jose Peraza and Kimson Hollibaugh, were redshirts this 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Fullerton coaches also are confident that freshman Brian Loyd can take 
over for Hemphill at catcher. "We think he'll be outstanding," Horton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton also has signed several top players. That group includes C.J. Ankrum 
of San Jose Saratoga High. An outfielder-first baseman, Ankrum was picked in 
the ninth round of the draft by the Dodgers. The Titans also have signed 
left-handed pitcher Derrin Ebert of Hesperia High, chosen in the 18th round by 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Other players who have committed to the Titans are catcher Michael Wright of 
San Jose Bellarmine High and catcher-infielder Mike Brambilla of Brea-Olinda 
High. The Titans also have signed two players from Rancho Santiago College, 
outfielder Matt Kastelic and infielder Joe Fraser. Pitcher Mark Chavez of 
Harbor College also is committed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel good about the kids we've signed," Horton said. "We may have the 
draft situation to deal with on a couple of them, but we're pleased at this 
point. We still expect to sign some other players."

ON EQUAL FOOTING; QUARTERBACK WATKINS, INJURY-FREE, RESOLVES TO IMPRESS 
RECRUITERS IN FINAL GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After learning he was the victim of a prank, Jeremie Watkins smiled, shook his 
head and jogged onto the football field at Newbury Park High. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 His Ventura County all-star East teammates, already in the middle of workout 
drills, teasingly laughed as he ran toward them, a rubber sandal on one foot 
and inquiring about a mysterious sartorial disappearance. 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Crook, who will share quarterback duties with Watkins in tonight's game, 
was the perpetrator -- hiding Watkins' right shoe before practice. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're here to have fun," Watkins said. "That's what this game should be: a 
lot of fun. " 
</P>
<P>
 But there is also a serious side for Watkins. The practical jokes and 
lighthearted practices can't disguise the importance of this game for the 
17-year-old Simi Valley High senior. 
</P>
<P>
 The game provides another chance for him to showcase his talent for college 
scouts who backed away after he suffered a career-threatening injury in the 
middle of the 1993 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yeah, I guess this is an important game," Watkins said. "I'm really looking 
forward to playing in it. It will be my chance to be out there at 100%." 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins suffered a broken left ankle in the second quarter of Simi Valley's 
game against crosstown rival Royal five weeks into the season. Just as he 
released the ball on a pass play, a Royal lineman hit him, knocking him down 
and landing on his ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to get up but it just wasn't going to happen," Watkins said. "At 
halftime they taped my ankle but when I tried running on the sidelines I felt a 
large amount of pain. I knew something was really wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, trainers and doctors thought it was a sprain that would heal 
quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 But X-rays the next day revealed a broken bone. Watkins' doctor said he would 
be sidelined for at least six weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 "I cried," Watkins said. "I may seem like a macho man, but I cried and cried. 
I don't know if I had enough tears in my body. I had never broken a bone in my 
body and it was tough to take." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time Watkins, 6-foot-1 and 185 pounds, was one of the area's top 
passers along with Keith Smith of Newbury Park and Westlake's Crook.  
</P>
<P>
 Smith, who was selected as an outfielder by the Detroit Tigers in baseball's 
amateur draft last week, will not play in tonight's game. Smith, who has a 
football scholarship to Arizona, led the state in passing and directed Newbury 
Park to a Southern Section title. 
</P>
<P>
 Crook received a football scholarship from Nevada Las Vegas. 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins will play at Moorpark College next season unless he gets a last-minute 
scholarship offer from a four-year school. 
</P>
<P>
 "In my opinion that injury cost Jeremie a scholarship," Simi Valley Coach 
Roger McCamy said. "He was eighth in the state in passing when he went down.  
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of big schools were interested in him and even after the injury some 
colleges have told him to walk on because he has a great chance of getting a 
scholarship as a sophomore." 
</P>
<P>
 UNLV, San Jose State and Fresno State were among the colleges interested in 
Watkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Determined to prove he still had what it takes to play Division I football, 
Watkins underwent intense therapy to return before the end of the season. He 
would not accept that his high school career had ended. 
</P>
<P>
 Almost four weeks after the injury, he  
</P>
<P>
 was back in uniform. Watkins was healthy enough to start in the Pioneers' last 
two games and passed for more than 200 yards in each. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just felt great," he said. "It was so great to be out there with the team 
again. When I was hurt I sat through every game and every practice and it was 
really tough. It was so hard not being able to participate in a game you love." 
</P>
<P>
 Watkins was selected to the All-Marmonte League first team. He finished the 
season with 118 completions for 1,669 yards and 14 touchdowns. He also played 
No. 2 doubles on Simi Valley's tennis team. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's at full strength now," said Newbury Park Coach George Hurley, coach of 
the East team. "He'll do great. He's a quality player and he's very good 
throwing the football. He also improvises well." 
</P>
<P>
 The comeback road has been tortuous for Watkins. While many of his Simi Valley 
football teammates took a postseason break, he started an intense workout 
program that includes weight training and running. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides daily practice with the all-star team, he trains on his own for about 
10 hours a week. 
</P>
<P>
 One of his biggest incentives has been the all-star game because he figured 
his ankle would be completely healed. 
</P>
<P>
 "From day one I thought I'm going to work, work, work for this game," Watkins 
said. "I really wanted to go into it in top shape." 
</P>
<P>
 Hurley has not yet determined who will start at quarterback, but he says 
Watkins and Crook will share the position.  
</P>
<P>
 It makes no difference, Watkins said, whether he plays in the first or second 
half as long as he gets a chance. He is hopeful that college recruiters will 
take note. 
</P>
<P>
 "You know I don't care where, I just want a college scholarship," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And the easygoing teen-ager stopped smiling. No matter how much goofing around 
he did during practice this week, tonight's game will be no laughing matter.

LOCAL NOTES: LONG BEACH STATE NAMES SHUMARD ASSISTANT ATHLETIC DIRECTOR 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Bill Shumard, who resigned as athletic director at Cal State Fullerton 
effective at the end of May, has bounced back quickly. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State announced Friday that Shumard will be the school's assistant 
athletic director for development and administration beginning on Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard, 43, is a 1972 graduate of Long Beach State. Shumard resigned after a 
troubled three-year tenure at Fullerton marked by unrest among 
student-athletes, the termination of the football program and a losing court 
battle in a wrongful termination suit brought by fired volleyball coach Jim 
Huffman. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm excited, and I think it's going to be a real good fit for me," Shumard 
said. "It will get me back doing some things I really enjoy. I didn't want to 
move, and I'll be working for and with good people again." 
</P>
<P>
 Shumard will oversee the marketing, promotions and ticket operations in 
addition to assisting the athletic director with the daily operation of the 
department, said Dave O'Brien, Long Beach State athletic director. LON EUBANKS

HOLLYWOOD PARK; ECLIPSE WINNERS TO SQUARE OFF 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BOB MIESZERSKI, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Barring a sudden cough or some other minor problem surfacing at the last 
minute, Hollywood Wildcat will finally return to the races in the $150,000 
Gamely Handicap at Hollywood Park on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Idle since her five-race winning streak ended when she was third in the La 
Canada Stakes at Santa Anita on Feb. 5, the Eclipse Award winner as the 
nation's top 3-year-old filly in 1993 will challenge Flawlessly in the Gamely, 
at 1 1/8 miles on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 Flawlessly, the two-time Eclipse winner as the nation's premier female grass 
performer, is also making her comeback in the Grade I event. The 6-year-old 
Affirmed mare hasn't raced since winning the Matriarch on Nov. 28 and is 
unbeaten in six starts on the Hollywood Park turf. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time two Eclipse champions faced each other at Hollywood Park was in 
the 1988 Gold Cup. Alysheba, the 3-year-old champion of 1987, finished second 
behind Cutlass Reality as Ferdinand, the top older male of '87, was third. 
</P>
<P>
 Scheduled to run in the Hawthorne Handicap on May 29, Hollywood Wildcat was 
scratched by trainer Neil Drysdale when she coughed before the race. She then 
was expected to come back in the Milady Handicap, which like the Hawthorne is 
run on the main track, on June 26, but Drysdale chose the Gamely. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's been ready to run for three weeks," the trainer said. "She's equally 
adept on both grass and dirt. The surface is not the matter. It's a matter of 
timing, and this race has come up and she's ready to run." 
</P>
<P>
 In a campaign that culminated in a nose victory over Paseana in the Breeders' 
Cup Distaff, Hollywood Wildcat won two races on the turf in 1993. She won a 
division of the San Clemente Handicap at Del Mar, then returned three weeks 
later to win the Del Mar Oaks. 
</P>
<P>
 Lightly raced the last two years, Flawlessly has been training steadily since 
early March for her latest comeback and capped her preparation for the Gamely 
with a 1:01 five-furlong workout Wednesday.

VENTURA COUNTY ALL-STAR BASKETBALL; LAUER TAKES CENTER STAGE WITH 7 BOMBS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG , TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>

<P>
 Peter Lauer of Thousand Oaks High failed to qualify for the halftime 
three-point shooting contest earlier in the week, but after connecting on seven 
three-pointers in the Ventura County all-star basketball game Friday night, 
Lauer managed to upstage all his counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauer scored 30 points and Washington-bound teammate Jason Hartman, also of 
Thousand Oaks, added 24 to pace the South's 119-94 victory over the North at 
Ventura High. 
</P>
<P>
 Lauer, who will play for Redlands next season, and Hartman combined for 19 of 
South's 38 points in the fourth quarter and turned a close game into a rout in 
the closing minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Thousand Oaks claimed the Marmonte League title this season, Lauer 
still felt he had a point to make. 
</P>
<P>
 "It proved T.O. basketball is one of the best in the area -- as usual," Lauer 
said. "I think there's a lot of schools out there that think we're not as good 
as them. We proved tonight that we're a good program." 
</P>
<P>
 The South led throughout most of the game, due in great part to the 
consistency of Lauer and Hartman. 
</P>
<P>
 The South reclaimed a lead, 56-54, on Lauer's three-point play just before 
halftime. The South maintained the lead, but the North stayed close with six 
players scoring in double figures. Guard Josh Babatua of Channel Islands 
totaled a team-high 16 points, followed by Oxnard's Jewels Eubanks with 15. 
</P>
<P>
 The South owned a four-point lead with 7 minutes 19 seconds remaining, but 
pulled away on a 14-4 run to build a 102-86 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, for those who turned out to watch the girls' game, there were two 
sources of excitement. 
</P>
<P>
 The first was a late scramble for the ball that left a pile of bodies at 
midcourt and finally got a reaction out of the crowd. 
</P>
<P>
 The second was Shawanda Hotchkiss, the 5-foot-8 guard from Channel Islands 
High who scored a game-high 12 points in leading her North to a 47-26 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 She showed a little of everything against the South, hustling for rebounds, 
driving the lane and playing tough defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "(Coach Joe Riccio) wanted to break it open," Hotchkiss said, "and we were 
going to do it with defense. Defense causes turnovers and turnovers cause 
layups." 
</P>
<P>
 The North, which had a 28-8 halftime lead, increased its margin to 45-17 in 
the fourth quarter after Jesaca Lepper made two free throws with 4:41 
remaining. Kathy Kelly's three-point basket narrowed it to 45-24, but the South 
got no closer. 
</P>
<P>
 Both teams had trouble converting easy scoring opportunities in the opening 
seconds before North's Mikko Giordano provided the first score with a layup one 
minute into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We kind of came into the game with the jitters," Hotchkiss said. "Then we 
settled down and once the players got to know each other on the court we played 
more smoothly." 
</P>
<P>
 The South could make only two baskets in the first quarter, and by the end of 
the quarter, the North had a 15-6 lead. 
</P>
<P>
 That was when Hotchkiss got hot, playing smothering defense. She scored eight 
points during a surge early in the second quarter, culminating with a 
three-point play that increased the North's lead to 26-6. 
</P>
<P>
 Forward Kristen Hansen of Simi Valley led the South with seven points. JEFF

FAST TRACK TO SUCCESS; HART'S MEDEARIS BECAME ONE OF STATE'S TOP HURDLERS AFTER 
HE QUIT OTHER SPORTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN ORTEGA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He considered himself a football, basketball and baseball player as a 
freshman, yet Jason Medearis will conclude his high school career as one of the 
nation's top hurdlers when he runs in the Golden West Invitational at American 
River College in Sacramento today. 
</P>
<P>
 The Hart High senior placed second in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles and 
fourth in the 110 highs in last week's state championships, and is eligible to 
compete in the National Scholastic Outdoor championships and the USA Track & 
Field Junior (age 19 and under) meet later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden West, however, will be his final high school meet. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the last time I'm going to run these races at the high school level 
so I'm going to be pretty fired up," he said. "I'm going to run all out and 
just start pumping my arms as hard as I can when I hit the straightaway." 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis will go through graduation ceremonies June 21, but has no plans for 
the summer besides hanging out with his friends and cruising in his "pride and 
joy," a 1969 Mustang hard-top. 
</P>
<P>
 That's quite a difference from the past three summers when Medearis' schedule 
included several passing leagues in preparation for football in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Accepting a track scholarship to Wyoming has put football in Medearis' past.  
</P>
<P>
 The three-year varsity letterman expects to experience some withdrawal pangs 
in the fall, but he's confident he did the right thing by choosing track. 
</P>
<P>
 At 6 feet, 175 pounds, Medearis needed to bulk up to play defensive back or 
wide receiver at the NCAA Division I level and the excess weight would have 
bogged him down on the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Running the hurdles also puts less stress on his body than playing football. 
And he knows about stress. 
</P>
<P>
 Last June, Medearis suffered a stress fracture in his left foot when he tried 
to cut upfield during the L.A. Watts Summer Games passing league competition.  
</P>
<P>
 Then he sustained a dislocated left shoulder in the second game of the season 
last fall. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the shoulder injury -- which ended his season -- was the more painful 
of the two, the stress fracture took a bigger emotional toll because it knocked 
him out of the final of the state track championships. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize now that I shouldn't have been playing football at that time," 
Medearis said earlier this season. "It wasn't worth it." 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis injury would have come after the state meet if not for an unusual 
decision by the California Interscholastic Federation to cancel the finals 
because the all-weather track at Cerritos College was unsafe for competition 
after a rainstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The state finals were canceled June 5, but the CIF rescheduled the event for 
June 19 after an avalanche of criticism. Medearis injured his foot June 13. 
</P>
<P>
 His absence was particularly disheartening because he performed so well in the 
preliminaries. 
</P>
<P>
 He posted the top mark -- a wind-aided 14.11 seconds -- in the highs and the 
fourth-best time (38.38) in the intermediates. 
</P>
<P>
 He surprised himself with his time in the highs and proved he could "run with 
the big boys." 
</P>
<P>
 That confidence carried over to his senior season. Medearis opened with an 
impressive victory in his heat of the 50-meter highs in the Sunkist 
Invitational in the Sports Arena in February. 
</P>
<P>
 He eventually lowered his personal bests from 14.49 to 14.12 in the highs and 
from 38.02 to 36.80 in the intermediates. 
</P>
<P>
 The time in the intermediates moved Medearis to third on the yearly national 
list and to second on the all-time region list behind Charles White, who ran 
36.4 in the 330-yard intermediates in 1976 for San Fernando High. 
</P>
<P>
 Using terms such as personal bests was foreign to Medearis four years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But that was before he took up track at the urging of his mother, Sally, who 
wanted to see how he would fare in an individual sport after he played freshman 
football and basketball but failed to make the freshman baseball team. 
</P>
<P>
 His mother encouraged him to become a sprinter, but he decided to take up the 
hurdles because he wanted "something a lot more challenging and I knew I didn't 
have blazing speed." 
</P>
<P>
 It was a wise decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis ran "around 16 seconds" in his first frosh-soph high hurdles race and 
from then on, he was a member of the varsity, winning the first of four 
consecutive league high hurdles titles as a freshman. 
</P>
<P>
 He competed in football, basketball and track as a sophomore, but dropped 
basketball to get a head start on track as a junior. 
</P>
<P>
 The move led to a breakthrough season as Medearis placed second in the 
intermediates and third in the highs in the Southern Section Division I 
championships, leading Hart to a second-place finish behind Muir. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was always thinking about getting a football scholarship," Medearis 
admitted. "But then I realized that my times in track were making me pretty 
appealing in that sport." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, after catching 24 passes for 491 yards and five touchdowns as a 
junior, Medearis regarded football as his No. 1 sport entering his senior 
season. 
</P>
<P>
 But when football recruiters stopped calling him after his shoulder injury, he 
began to contemplate a track career in college. 
</P>
<P>
 He will focus on the 400-meter intermediate hurdles, an event that tests speed 
and stamina by requiring a hurdler to clear 10 three-foot-high hurdles during 
the race. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis will still compete in the 110 highs, but his future lies in the 
intermediates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm going to have to hit the weights a little more and get my (quadriceps) 
stronger because they're pretty tiny right now," Medearis said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But the 400s are going to be my race." 
</P>
<P>
 Spoken like an athlete committed to the hurdles.

GOLDEN WEST RAISES LEVEL FOR AREA BEST; TRACK: FISCHER, TUIMOLOAU AND OTHERS 
WILL FACE TOP COMPETITORS FROM AROUND THE NATION AT MEET IN SACRAMENTO. 
</P>

<P>
 State track and field champions Jeremy Fischer of Camarillo High and Dolores 
Tuimoloau of Channel Islands will compete against some of the nation's best in 
the Golden West Invitational at American River College today in Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Fischer, the national outdoor leader in the high jump at 7 feet 4 inches, is 
one of seven entrants to have cleared 7 feet this season. 
</P>
<P>
 Sophomore Kevin Dotson (7-2 1/4 of Los Alamos, N.M., senior Shannon King (7-1 
1/2) of Waukegan, Ill., and junior Bobby Williams (7-1 1/4) of Great Bend, 
Kan., head the list of challengers. 
</P>
<P>
 Tuimoloau, the state leader in the shot-put with a personal best of 49-2, was 
eagerly awaiting a meeting with national leader Collinus Newsome (52-1 3/4) of 
Denver South High, but Newsome is not entered in the Golden West meet. 
</P>
<P>
 In her absence, senior Rebecca Ball (46-2 1/4) of Dansburg, Ohio, and 
sophomore Sua Seilala (45-7 1/4) of St. Thomas Aquinas of Florida are expected 
to give Tuimoloau her stiffest competition. 
</P>
<P>
 Jason Medearis of Hart, Antonio Arce of Palmdale, Jamaal Chase of Quartz Hill 
and Cathy Prater of Agoura also are entered in the meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Medearis, who placed second in the 300-meter intermediate hurdles and fourth 
in the 110 highs in last week's state championships, will try to improve upon 
his personal bests of 36.80 seconds and 14.12 in those events. 
</P>
<P>
 Arce, the runner-up in the state meet in the 3,200 with a time of 9 minutes 
3.19 seconds, is gunning for his fourth personal best in as many meets. 
</P>
<P>
 Chase bounded a personal best of 49-11 in the triple jump to finish second in 
the state meet and hopes to crack the 50-foot barrier today.  
</P>
<P>
 He is also entered in the long jump and has a personal best of 24-2 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Prater, third in the 1993 state championships in the 300 low hurdles and 
second last week, has slashed her personal best from 44.45 to 43.62 in the past 
three meets.

SANTA ANA VALLEY BASEBALL COACH QUITS; PREPS: MUSICK, WHO HAD COACHED IN 
DISTRICT 29 YEARS, CITES DETERIORATION OF SCHOOL'S FIELD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley baseball Coach Herschel Musick announced his resignation 
Friday, citing the deterioration of the school's baseball facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Musick, who has coached in the Santa Ana Unified District for 29 years, said 
in a statement the Santa Ana Valley baseball field has reached the point that 
the school's ground crew cannot maintain its condition. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the field is on campus, Musick said the city's parks and recreation 
department supervises it. But Musick said he is also disappointed in district 
officials' lack of concern. 
</P>
<P>
 "The baseball facility is always in need of repair and maintenance, but no 
help is forthcoming from the city," Musick said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every year, the expense of replacing turf and brick dirt, the repair and 
replacement of fencing and graffiti has been the responsibility of Valley high 
school and the baseball booster club." 
</P>
<P>
 Said Senior Parks Supervisor Paul Johnson: "It is a joint-use facility. The 
agreement we have with (the school district) is we clean up around the field, 
but we have no specific responsibilities for maintaining the baseball field." 
</P>
<P>
 A district official, who asked not to be identified, said the joint contract 
requires the parks department to clean up the field. Musick said the contract, 
drawn in 1960, covers more, including the building of restrooms, a storage area 
and a snack bar. The restrooms were installed two years ago, but the storage 
facility and snack bar have not been constructed. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're suppose to clean up the field after an event and even that doesn't 
always take place," Musick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said the primary recreation uses were the Golden City League and the 
Valley Senior Little League. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Musick, the Golden City League pays the city $2,000 per year to 
use the facility. He said the city hasn't used any of the revenue to maintain 
the field. 
</P>
<P>
 "They put a lot of wear and tear on it," Musick said. 
</P>
<P>
 Other groups rent the field for day use, according to Santa Ana Valley 
Principal Bob Nelson. 
</P>
<P>
 "The parks and recreation department gets rental fees from groups, they 
control the booking," Nelson said. "It seems to me some of the user fee could 
go back into maintenance." 
</P>
<P>
 Musick said when the field is used by outside groups, there is no supervision 
by recreation officials. He also said the field suffers from overuse. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every baseball coach would like to have his own facility and have it locked 
up so no one uses it besides themselves," Johnson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The damage has been substantial, Musick said. The dugouts and backstop need 
repair. The infield and outfield need to be leveled. 
</P>
<P>
 "The recreation department has refused to take responsibility for vandalism 
and damage . . . while the field is being used by authorized groups," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Musick said the the outfield area is used by the soccer teams, the school's 
team and recreation teams. The holes in the outfield, he said, are a safety 
hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that the field should be enclosed by a fence to prevent unauthorized 
use. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Musick suggested that fenced batting cages be installed, so the 
baseball programs can remain competitive with other Century League teams. He 
said every other league school has batting cages. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Musick: "Although I still have much to offer, the time and effort it will 
take to deal with the concerns listed is more than I'm prepared to give." 
</P>
<P>
 Musick has given for nearly three decades. He founded the school's baseball 
program in 1960 and ran the team until 1976. He retired from coaching, but 
could not stay away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just enjoyed coaching -- working with kids, teaching the game, seeing a 
team improve," Musick said. 
</P>
<P>
 It kept drawing him back. 
</P>
<P>
 Musick returned to Santa Ana Valley in 1982 and coached two seasons, took a 
year off, then was an assistant at Santa Ana High for five seasons. Musick came 
back to the Falcons in 1990. He retired as a teacher at the school two years 
ago but remained as a walk-on coach. 
</P>
<P>
 He has a record of 304-269-2 with eight league championships and 10 Southern 
Section playoff appearances. The Falcons reached the 4-A title game in 1967. 
They reached the semifinals three times.

CROOK, WATKINS LEAD EAST IN VENTURA COUNTY GAME 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By IRENE GARCIA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With two of the East team's top players having bowed out of tonight's Ventura 
County high school all-star football game at Moorpark High, Marmonte League 
quarterbacks Kevin Crook and Jeremie Watkins will take center stage. 
</P>
<P>
 Newbury Park quarterback Keith Smith will not play in the game because he was 
drafted by the Detroit Tigers last week in the fifth round of baseball's 
amateur draft and does not want to risk injury. 
</P>
<P>
 Teammate Leodes Van Buren, a wide receiver, will not play because he is 
awaiting trial on a weapons charge. The 18-year-old has been charged with 
firing a gunshot into his girlfriend's Newbury Park home April 8. 
</P>
<P>
 Crook completed 173 passes for 2,736 yards and 21 touchdowns last season for 
Westlake. Simi Valley's Watkins completed 118 passes for 1,669 yards and 14 
touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 The West, coached by Buena's Rick Scott, will feature George Keiaho, a 
four-year starter at Buena and one of the state's top running backs. 
</P>
<P>

DIGEST: COOPER LEAVES COACHING TO SPEND TIME WITH FAMILY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After coaching high school baseball for 30 years, Hoover High's Bob Cooper has 
retired to spend time with his children and grandchildren. 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper, 53, made the news official this week after 19 seasons as Hoover's 
coach. He will continue to teach physical education at the school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to (Principal) Don Duncan weeks ago about calling it quits because 
I've been thinking about it for a while," Cooper said. "I haven't had Easter 
vacation in 30 years." 
</P>
<P>
 Cooper coached at Harvard-Westlake, Elsinore and Lee Vining in the Southern 
Sierra before taking over at Hoover in 1976.  
</P>
<P>
 He led the Tornadoes to 13 league championships and 18 playoff berths. This 
season the team finished with an 11-5 record and lost in the first round of the 
Southern Section playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 He won a Southern Section championship at Elsinore and his 1983 Hoover team 
was ranked No. 1 in the state. He compiled a career record of 465-255-2. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll still be around the game," Cooper said. "I'm not going to absolutely cut 
myself from it. I love baseball." 
</P>
<P>
 A leading candidate to replace Cooper is Jim Delzell, his assistant of five 
years. Boys' Volleyball  
</P>
<P>
 Matt Olsen of Royal High, a senior who led the Highlanders to the Southern 
Section Division II championship, has been named the divisional player of the 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 The first team also includes junior Eric Carlsen and senior Josh White of 
Royal, senior Brent Phillips of Canyon and senior David Sotolov of Thousand 
Oaks.  
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Toby Sides and Mac Wilson and junior Ryan Millar of Highland, which 
lost to Royal in the final, also made the first team. 
</P>
<P>
 In Division I, senior Matt Sebree of Harvard-Westlake made the first team. 
</P>
<P>
 Seniors Sean Farrel of L.A. Baptist and Brodie McClain of Village Christian 
made the Division III team. Baseball  
</P>
<P>
 Cal Lutheran pitcher Marc Weiss, drafted in the 26th round pick by the 
Cincinnati Reds, signed with the club on Friday and has been assigned to 
Class-A Billings, Mont.  
</P>
<P>
 Weiss, a junior right-hander, posted a record of 10-2 for the Kingsmen last 
season. Terms of the contract were not disclosed.

MCGRAW CLAIMS MAIN AT VENTURA RACEWAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DARIN ESPER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When Ventura's Randy McGraw won his first 15-lap Street Stock main event at 
Ventura Raceway on April 29, the two fastest cars in the race were not on the 
lead lap, as James Weston of Santa Barbara and Paul Moore of Oak View both had 
flat tires. 
</P>
<P>
 In Friday night's 15-lap feature, McGraw, starting from the second position, 
grabbed the lead at the start and went virtually wire-to-wire for his second 
victory, fighting off strong efforts by Weston and Moore in the process. 
</P>
<P>
 The only lap that McGraw didn't lead was the ninth, when he spun slightly 
between Turn 1 and Turn 2, allowing Bill Bartels of Marina del Rey to take the 
lead. 
</P>
<P>
 But the hard luck that has plagued Bartels in earlier races popped up again 
when his car slowed less than half a lap later when a tire came off of its rim. 
Officially, he never held the lead. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston, a three-time winner this year, had been running third when Bartels 
dropped out, while Moore, defending series champion and current points leader, 
was sixth. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore only needed one lap to get past both Jim Firisich of Port Hueneme and Al 
Adam of Westlake Village to slip into third place, and on Lap 11, Weston and 
Moore were neck-and-neck as they came past the finish line directly behind 
McGraw. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston pulled away from Moore and stayed on McGraw's bumper through three of 
the final four laps, but McGraw was able to keep ahead of Weston through the 
turns, denying him a chance to pass on four different occasions. 
</P>
<P>
 As the racers came out of Turn 4 heading into the final lap, McGraw cut in 
front of Weston again and Weston spun into the infield and back onto the track. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore gave chase, but it was a case of too little, too late as the hometown 
favorite took the victory in front of a crowd that had been on its feet for the 
final five laps. 
</P>
<P>
 Weston was able to restart and finish fifth, behind Adail Gayhart of Malibu 
and Adam. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 15-lap Mini Stock main, Tim Gill of Somis passed Ventura's Fred 
Woodward on the final lap to earn his first victory. Gary Hubert of Somis was 
second, Jim Tietz of Camarillo was third, and points leader Bruce Dunson of 
Santa Barbara was fourth.

MOORE JUST A PERFECT FIT IN DETROIT; BASEBALL: THE TIGERS HAVE A SURPLUS OF 
LONG-BALL HITTERS, GIVING THIS PITCHER PLENTY OF ROOM TO WORK. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN WEYLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the Tigers signed Mike Moore to a three-year, $10-million contract in 
December, 1992, Detroit Manager Sparky Anderson proclaimed he would be the 
second coming of Jack Morris. 
</P>
<P>
 Well, not exactly . . . but for Anderson, who makes a habit of taking 
hyperbole to new heights with every other utterance, it was almost an 
understatement. 
</P>
<P>
 And as it turns out, Moore is a perfect match for the Tigers. If he were 
pitching for the Dodgers in the mid-'60s, he might not have a victory yet. But 
with Detroit hitters turning baseballs into instant souvenirs -- they've hit at 
least one homer in 17 consecutive games and lead the majors with 87 home runs 
-- he has pitched well enough to run his record to 7-4. 
</P>
<P>
 The team-leading victory total is really the only impressive number on the 
statistics sheet to the right of Moore's name. His earned-run average is 5.44. 
He has walked 58 batters in 86 innings and has given up 16 home runs. Last 
year, he allowed 35 home runs, most in the American League. 
</P>
<P>
 But what the statistics don't show is Moore's experience, his savvy, his wile, 
if you will. Sure, Moore gets burned by the long ball, but on his terms. Of 
those 16 homers this season, 12 have been of the bases-empty variety and the 
four others were two-run shots. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night, Chad Curtis and Chili Davis hit home runs off Moore. The Angels 
had four walks and five hits in the seven innings Moore pitched. But they 
scored just three runs and the Tigers had another ho-hum victory at Anaheim 
Stadium, 8-4. 
</P>
<P>
 "I started off kind of sluggish," Moore said. "I didn't really get warmed up 
and I wasn't throwing it very well in the first couple of innings. I just had 
no rhythm. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I concentrated on keeping the ball down and changing speeds, and with 
this team, if you can find a way to stick around for six or seven innings, 
they're probably going to score some runs for you." 
</P>
<P>
 At 34 and in his 13th major league season, Moore is no longer the pitcher who 
was 19-11 with a 2.81 ERA and 3-0 with a 1.35 ERA in three postseason starts 
for the Oakland A's in 1989. Opposing hitters managed only a .219 batting 
average against him that season. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, they're hitting .252, but Moore remains a key reason the Tigers, 
who have won eight of the last 11, are headed in the opposite direction of the 
Angels, who have lost nine of the last 11. 
</P>
<P>
 Moore is a master of the pitch-well-enough-to-win school. He has pitched more 
than 200 innings in each of the last 10 seasons except one. In 1990, he threw 
199 1/3 innings. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you can throw 200 innings, you're doing something right," Moore said. 
"You're keeping your team in the ballgame, giving them the opportunity to win." 
</P>
<P>
 That philosophy was made to order for the heavy-hitting Tigers and it's 
working for Moore, who has won four of his last five starts. The loss, 
curiously, was May 26 to the Angels. At Baltimore a week later, however, he 
earned a victory after giving up eight hits and four earned runs in 5 1/3 
innings. It wasn't the kind of outing that would have made Sandy Koufax happy, 
but it kept the Tigers in sight of the American League East leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've never paid much attention to stats," Moore said. "I just try to keep 
focused on the bottom line, the wins and losses."

FORMER ALASKA COACH TO LEAD LADYCATS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTIN HENDERSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jeff Sink, the third-winningest girls' basketball coach in Alaska history, was 
named Friday to coach Brea-Olinda's program. 
</P>
<P>
 Sink, 43, was hired in October, 1993, to teach history for the 1994-95 school 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 He saw the four-time defending State champion Ladycats during the playoffs 
while on a house-hunting trip to the area in March. He was a finalist for the 
position last year, but the job went to Brea assistant John Hattrup. 
Brea-Olinda finished 33-0 and was ranked No. 1 in one national poll. Hattrup 
resigned May 31 because he wanted full-time employment. 
</P>
<P>
 Sink compiled a 272-73 record in 13 years at Fairbanks Lathrop, and was 130-20 
over the last six.  
</P>
<P>
 Lathrop won state titles in 1990 and 1992, won six consecutive regional titles 
and finished among the top four teams in the state eight times. Sink was twice 
named state coach of the year.

THE TIMES 1994 SPRING ALL-COUNTY TEAMS; MARIANO DEALS FOES A SOUND POUNDING; 
PLAYER OF THE YEAR: BESIDES HIS POWERFUL SPIKES, OPPONENTS WERE HURT BY EL TORO 
OUTSIDE HITTER'S PASSING AND JUMP SERVES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Before the season began, his coach said he could be the best outside hitter El 
Toro High has produced. By season's end, Ryan Mariano proved he was Orange 
County's best player. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariano, a 6-foot-3 senior who has signed with Long Beach State, is The Times 
Orange County boys' volleyball player of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 His all-around play led the Chargers to a 10-0 finish in the South Coast 
League, the county's toughest. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers won the Orange County Championships and were ranked No. 1 for 
most of the season. Mariano's thundering spikes are what most opponents first 
notice, but he was also one of the team's top passers. He also has a dangerous 
jump serve. 
</P>
<P>
 Mariano helped El Toro earn the top seeding for the Division I playoffs, but 
the Chargers were upset in the semifinals, losing to eventual champion, 
Huntington Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were really surprised to lose to Huntington Beach," Mariano said. "It was 
a shock, but a good learning experience." 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers battled for three hours with Huntington Beach but succumbed in 
the fifth game, 18-16. 
</P>
<P>
 "I never got frustrated," said Mariano, who had 31 kills in that match. "When 
it's 15-15 in the fifth and the pressure is on one person, that's great. That's 
why everyone plays." 
</P>
<P>
 Mariano credits his improvement to teammates and El Toro Coach Mike Jagd. 
</P>
<P>
 "Coach Jagd did a phenomenal job of keeping us focused," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 And Mariano's teammates kept his attention in practice. Facing 6-9 middle 
blocker Chris Jacobson and outside hitter Doug Thompson in practice helped 
Mariano with his blocking.

THE TIMES 1994 SPRING ALL-COUNTY TEAMS; FOOTHILL'S OETTINGER ICES THE 
COMPETITION; ATHLETE OF THE YEAR: JUNIOR DOESN'T BUCKLE UNDER PRESSURE ALL 
SEASON, DOMINATING FOUR TRACK AND FIELD EVENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MATT FARMER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tara Oettinger had a number of break-through performances when the heat was on 
this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior responded to the pressure of the State meet by winning the long 
jump, becoming the first individual track and field State champion in the 
30-year history of Foothill High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier in the year, Oettinger won four events at the Orange County 
Championships, leading the Knights to a second-place finish. 
</P>
<P>
 She scored three more victories at the Century League finals, again leading 
Foothill to second place. 
</P>
<P>
 For her multitude of talents, Oettinger is The Times Orange County girls' 
track and field athlete of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 The title is a fitting one for Oettinger, who thoroughly dominated the county 
on the track and in the field. 
</P>
<P>
 Oettinger found her niche late in the season, turning back State long jump 
competitors to win the event on her first effort in the finals with a 
personal-best 19 feet 7 1/2 inches. 
</P>
<P>
 On the track, Oettinger ran the 100, 200 and 400 meters, losing only one race 
to a county athlete all season. 
</P>
<P>
 Adding the 400 to her repertoire this year, Oettinger blazed to a 57.72 
clocking to win going away at the county championships. And this was after 
easily turning back county foes in the 100 and long jump earlier in the 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Tired but finished, Oettinger got into the starting blocks for the 200, her 
final event of the day. Taking a huge lead coming off the turn, she cruised to 
victory in 25.17, equaling her personal best and county-leading time she 
achieved at both the Arcadia Invitational and Mt. San Antonio Relays just weeks 
before. 
</P>
<P>
 She lost to Villa Park's Megan Reppe in the 100 at the Century League finals, 
but bounced back to win the 200, 400 and long jump at the same meet. 
</P>
<P>
 Oettinger then established a personal and county best in the long jump at the 
section Division II prelims, leaping 19-1 3/4. 
</P>
<P>
 In the division finals, without having to worry about her usual four events, 
Oettinger finished second in the long jump with a wind-aided effort of 18-6 
3/4. She followed that with a second-place finish in the quarter mile, running 
57.87, the second-fastest time of her life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Masters meet brought her redemption for the division loss, as Oettinger 
jumped 18-7 to lead all section qualifiers into the State meet.

KEENAN BLAMES HYPE FOR RANGER TROUBLES; STANLEY CUP FINALS: COACH SAYS GAME 5 
COLLAPSE AGAINST THE CANUCKS WAS THE RESULT OF DISTRACTIONS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By HELENE ELLIOTT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Coach Mike Keenan of the New York Rangers, claiming reports he will leave for 
a general manager/coaching position in Detroit had undermined his team's 
chances of clinching the Stanley Cup, said Friday he has no intention of 
relinquishing his job. 
</P>
<P>
 Keenan, speaking after the team's late-afternoon practice at the Pacific 
Coliseum, blamed an overly heightened sense of anticipation for the Rangers' 
failure to win the Cup in New York on Thursday night. He also said rumors about 
his future had created an atmosphere of uncertainty that contributed to the 6-3 
loss to the Vancouver Canucks. 
</P>
<P>
 The series will continue tonight at the Pacific Coliseum, where the Rangers 
won Games 3 and 4. A seventh game, if necessary, would be played Tuesday at New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
 "There was so much hype, like that whole nonsense about me leaving New York," 
Keenan said. "There's no foundation to it. No truth to it at all. There's 
absolutely nothing to it. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's why people (with the Rangers) haven't been able to win the thing for 
54 years. The hype is much greater in New York than any place else in the NHL. 
</P>
<P>
 "As soon as I saw the headlines (heralding a Ranger Cup victory), I knew we 
were in deep trouble. If I were (Canuck Coach) Pat Quinn, I wouldn't have had 
any trouble motivating my team. The New York media hype helped Pat motivate his 
club." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Keenan's players said the media were not the reasons for their 
defensive collapse late in Thursday's game. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can find excuses if you look for them. I don't think it played any 
factor," left wing Adam Graves said. "We just didn't play the way we wanted to 
in order to be successful. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes things happen, and I don't think you can blame it on one thing or 
another. We as a team didn't play how we feel we have to in order to win, and 
we have to get back to that style. It happened for whatever reasons, and we're 
not looking (at the media) as an excuse." 
</P>
<P>
 Said defenseman Brian Leetch: "It didn't have any effect. This team and the 
players have a lot of expectations of ourselves. . . . Vancouver came out and 
played desperate hockey, and we got away from the things we needed to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Ranger captain Mark Messier called a team meeting after Friday's practice. 
Keenan and his assistants were not invited. 
</P>
<P>
 "He doesn't do that too often," Leetch said of Messier's summons. "Just here 
and there throughout the season. It was a time all the guys are together, so it 
was a good time to get feelings across. . . . It was just reinforcement." 
</P>
<P>
 If their confidence is crumbling, Messier wouldn't say so.  
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't really matter what we talked about," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But he did say he and the Rangers felt no undue pressure from the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "That kind of attention is to be expected," he said. "It's a tough thing. 
There's a lot of pressure you play under, and that's why it's tough to win the 
Stanley Cup, because there are a lot of things you have to handle at this stage 
of the game. Hopefully, we can handle it better (tonight)." 
</P>
<P>
 Said forward Esa Tikkanen of the collapse: "We were too excited and we tried 
to do too much. They kept coming back and they broke our backs. The bottom line 
is we have to have 20 guys play 60 minutes." 
</P>
<P>
 The Canucks, who succeeded in bothering the Rangers with physical play -- and 
capitalized on the Rangers' loss of defenseman Jeff Beukeboom to a first-period 
ejection -- intend to target Leetch again because he is the Ranger catalyst. 
They hope to get the same kind of balanced scoring they got Thursday, when five 
line combinations produced goals. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Canuck center Trevor Linden: "In the first game we had a great 
goaltending performance from Kirk (McLean), but we really hadn't played well 
against them until (Thursday). We scored some goals and took it to them. I 
think it really reinforces and gives the guys a lot of confidence coming into 
(tonight)."

FEAR OF 'FLESH-EATING DISEASE' SPREADS FASTER THAN CASES OF IT; MEDICINE: WOMAN 
RECOVERS IN ANAHEIM HOSPITAL. HEALTH EXPERTS STRESS VIRUS IS RARE, NOT EASILY 
SPREAD. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LEE ROMNEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER

<TEXT>
<P>
 Doctors here tried to calm fears Friday about the so-called "flesh-eating 
disease" as a Stanton woman who recovered from a potentially fatal 
streptococcus virus was released from the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaiser Permanente physicians said they have seen five cases of severe group A 
streptococcal infections in the past six months, caused by the same bacteria as 
the more common strep throat. Three of those cases led to the condition that 
eats away at the filmy tissue layer that surrounds muscles. 
</P>
<P>
 The Anaheim doctors, along with Orange County Health Care Agency 
epidemiologist Hildy Meyers, stressed Friday that the disease is nothing new, 
remains rare and is not particularly contagious. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers said the recent media descriptions of diseased victims have sent 
frightened county residents rushing unnecessarily to the phone to call their 
doctors about even minor cuts.  
</P>
<P>
 "This is not an epidemic. It's a rare condition. It's a horrible thing for 
anybody who gets it, but it's not something people have to wake up in the 
morning and worry about," Meyers said. "We recommend good hygiene. Wash your 
cuts with soap and water . . . and cover your mouth when you cough." 
</P>
<P>
 One of the Kaiser patients -- a 36-year-old woman who also had toxic-shock 
syndrome caused by the strep infection -- died about a month ago. Another man 
was recently released from the hospital after recovering from the gangrenous 
disease.  
</P>
<P>
 The third patient was Kimberly Johnson, 23, of Stanton, who described her 
months-long ordeal at a press conference Friday as she thanked God for her life 
and legs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was thinking, 'How did it get in me and why?' " asked Johnson, who sat in a 
wheelchair, her leg bandaged and emaciated from a series of surgeries to cut 
out infected muscle lining.  
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't have any cuts. I didn't get bit by any bugs, and there it was. I was 
thinking, 'If it can eat my flesh, it can eat my insides.' I feel I'm very 
lucky to be alive. Very." 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson underwent three surgeries after a thumb-size knot, which she noticed 
on her calf on April 15, grew to infect her leg from ankle to hip, said her 
doctor, infectious-disease specialist Arnold Henson. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson, who has two daughters, 4 and 6, said she was in severe pain before 
the surgeries finally removed the infected tissue. She will undergo months of 
physical therapy to regain the use of her leg. Her plan upon returning home: 
'Eat some pancakes. Lots and lots of pancakes. No more hospital food." 
</P>
<P>
 While the doctors stressed that the disease is nothing new, Dr. Lincoln 
Spurgeon, the hospital's chief of internal medicine, said it appears there has 
been a gradual increase in the virulence of the bacteria strain "perhaps 
worldwide and especially in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Spurgeon encouraged anyone with potential symptoms to seek medical attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "The important point is if someone has fever or redness, or a swelling of 
their extremities, they should seek medical care right away," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Meyers of the county Health Care Agency said statistics on invasive Group A 
streptococcal infections have not been kept long enough to assess any trends. 
But she stressed that few cases have been reported to the department.  
</P>
<P>
 Since January, 39 cases of invasive Group A strep have been reported to the 
county, she said. But only two of those cases were reported as leading to the 
so-called flesh-eating condition, known medically as necrotizing fasciitis, she 
said. After one victim, 43-year-old Gary Prettyman of San Clemente, went public 
with his story recently, other cases such as the ones revealed at Kaiser came 
to light, Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 There are about 10,000 to 15,000 cases across the country every year of 
invasive Group A streptococcal infections, and they turn into the gangrenous 
variety 10% to 15% of the time, Meyers said, citing federal statistics. That 
should translate to about five to 15 Orange County cases a year, she said.

ANAHEIM POLICE SHOOT TO DEATH MAN IN MOTHER'S APARTMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACY WEBER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It was the blood covering the stairs leading to her Hampshire Square apartment 
that started Doy Mulford's heart pounding. 
</P>
<P>
 Then the neighbor's unthinking comment: "Oh, they blew him away good." 
</P>
<P>
 Then the half-dozen police officers barring the entrance to her one-bedroom 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulford knew before the officers said a word. The man they'd shot in her 
cramped apartment Friday afternoon was her 24-year-old son, Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw the blood and I said, 'Oh my son, why did they blow him away until he 
died?' " said Mulford, 45, her voice cracking. "He's an innocent boy. He's a 
mental patient. He was in his own mother's apartment." 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Sgt. Steve Rodig said the officers could have done nothing else. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodig said that shortly after noon, two patrol officers responded to a 
neighbor's call that a man was breaking into Mulford's apartment in the 2500 
block of East Ward Terrace. When the police arrived they saw Charlie Mulford 
inside Apartment 88 and ordered him out. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead, he said, Charlie Mulford came toward the officers carrying a "deadly 
weapon," which Rodig would not identify. 
</P>
<P>
 The officers, still standing outside the apartment, ordered Charlie Mulford to 
drop the weapon and sprayed him with a chemical repellent. When he continued 
toward the officers, one officer fired a fatal shot into his chest, Rodig said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what else the officers could have done," Rodig said. "If the 
officer had been struck with (what Mulford was carrying) he would have 
sustained great bodily harm." 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't go around shooting people for no reason," he said. "When the police 
get a call of a burglary in progress, they don't have time, unfortunately, to 
do a background check, to find out if someone is mentally ill." 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday night, Doy Mulford and her son's friends couldn't believe the 
officers could have shot the 5-foot-8, 150-pound Charlie. 
</P>
<P>
 "Charlie was a docile human being," said his friend Gary Turner, of Anaheim. 
"He wouldn't hurt anybody." 
</P>
<P>
 Doy Mulford said her son began to have mental problems in 1988 and was 
diagnosed as a schizophrenic. She said he was taking lithium and living in a 
Westminster board and care home. The mother had moved from Fullerton to the 
Anaheim apartment complex three months ago. She said her son often visited and 
stayed the night. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Charlie Mulford had taken two buses to her house to wait for her to 
return from the post office, where she was picking up a support check from her 
former husband in New York, the mother said. They had planned to go to the 
doctor when she returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's the only family I have here," she said. "He's not a dummy. He's a good 
boy. He's a good person." 
</P>
<P>
 She said her son was afraid of strangers and had sometimes irritated her 
neighbors by singing Christian songs at full volume.  
</P>
<P>
 Turner said Charlie would sometimes throw tantrums to get attention. "He would 
scream and yell," Turner said. "He would do that all the time. The police 
should have known" that he was mentally ill. 
</P>
<P>
 Ethel Marmo, who lives across the street from the apartment complex, said she 
was parking her car when two police cars arrived and followed the officers into 
the complex courtyard, standing under the apartment while the officers 
approached it. 
</P>
<P>
 "I got nosy and wanted to see what was going on," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Marmo said she didn't hear the officers yell anything to Mulford, but heard 
him loudly cursing at the police. 
</P>
<P>
 "That guy was swearing bad," she said. "You know four-letter words." 
</P>
<P>
 After the yelling, Marmo said, one police officer went inside while the other 
remained outside. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then I heard a gunshot -- that's all I heard," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Mulford was airlifted to UCI Medical Center in Orange, where he was pronounced 
dead on arrival, said Nancy Rhomberg, a hospital spokesperson. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police officials declined to identify the officer involved in the 
shooting while the case is under investigation by the department and the Orange 
County district attorney's office.

CSUF BARS PADDLING PROFESSOR FROM CLASSES; EDUCATION: BLACK STUDENT SEEKS $1 
MILLION IN BIAS CLAIM. SCHOOL OFFICIALS SAYS 'APPROPRIATE ACTION' HAS BEEN 
TAKEN AGAINST THE INSTRUCTOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A professor emeritus who said he swatted an African American student on the 
bare behind with a ruler will not be teaching at Cal State Fullerton anytime 
soon, according to a university official who said Friday that "appropriate 
action" has been taken in the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Professor Emeritus Julian Foster said he swatted the student during 
discussions over whether the student would be allowed to drop his political 
science class, but the professor said his actions were part of a joke that has 
since been taken out of context. 
</P>
<P>
 The student, Keary Jones, 23, of Fullerton, filed a discrimination claim 
Friday against the professor and the university seeking $1 million in damages. 
Jones said the teacher's actions were degrading, but that he initially agreed 
to be paddled because he was desperate to keep a failing grade off this record 
so he could graduate this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Jerry Keating, spokesman for the university, said school officials looked into 
the incident earlier in the week and have since taken "appropriate action."  
</P>
<P>
 Keating declined to elaborate, but said that Foster, 67, will not be teaching 
classes during the upcoming summer, fall or spring 1995 sessions. 
</P>
<P>
 Keating said he is not aware of any school policy regarding such physical 
contact between a professor and student. 
</P>
<P>
 "Frankly, I'm not aware of any specific language regarding spanking, because 
that's not the kind of thing you expect here," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident occurred April 27 when Johns had asked to drop Foster's class. 
Johns said the professor offered him two choices: six whacks with a ruler or a 
failing grade. The student said agreed to drop his sweat pants because he was 
desperate to graduate. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns said he backed away and began crying after Foster hit him once. He said 
Foster later told him that he had heard black fraternity members go through 
much worse during hazing and even brand each other.  
</P>
<P>
 Foster ultimately allowed the student to drop the class without being 
penalized. He participated in graduation ceremonies last week, but still must 
take a math class this summer to complete his undergraduate studies. 
</P>
<P>
 Many in the university community said Friday they were surprised by the 
peculiar incident, because Foster, who is white, is a well-regarded campus 
figure who has taught at the school since 1963. Leaders in the Orange County 
African American community said they are looking at the incident, but took care 
not to immediately categorize it as a racist incident. 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview Thursday, Foster told The Times he regretted striking Johns. 
He said the incident took place after the professor and student each tried to 
outbluff each other during a dispute over whether Johns should be allowed to 
drop the class to escape a failing grade. 
</P>
<P>
 The complaint filed by Johns alleges racial discrimination and assault and 
battery. Foster has denied that race played any role in the incident. 
</P>
<P>
 But Johns said he was particularly offended by the comment Foster made 
regarding black fraternity members.  
</P>
<P>
 "I don't honestly think he would have done this to a white kid," said Johns, 
who does not belong to a fraternity. 
</P>
<P>
 Johns had needed Foster's permission to drop the class, because an incomplete 
grade would result in a failure and could keep Johns from graduating.  
</P>
<P>
 Foster said in a statement Friday that Johns originally asked the professor to 
give him a D grade, even though Johns never attended any classes. Foster said 
he was lecturing the student on whether he wanted to be treated like a 
responsible adult or a "dumb kid who gets his bottom swatted when he breaks the 
rules?" 
</P>
<P>
 Foster said he was joking, but Johns wanted to take him up on the offer. 
Trying to call the student's bluff, the professor said in his statement, Foster 
told Johns the penalty would be six lashes, the same amount of strikes that an 
American teen faced in Singapore for a vandalizing spree. 
</P>
<P>
 Foster said Johns surprised him by dropping his sweat pants. 
</P>
<P>
 "I flicked him with the ruler and was about to admit that he had won the 
bluffing contest," when Johns' demeanor changed and he became upset, Foster 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I think this was all a big misunderstanding," said Chris Lowe, student body 
president at the university. "It's very unfortunate. I know the professor and 
he is real personable, and I know he would never set out to hurt any student, 
physically or mentally." 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Tippins, vice president of the local branch of the National Assn. for the 
Advancement of Colored People, said the organization will look into the 
incident, but did not want to make any assumptions in advance. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned, and we will look into it and take any steps if necessary," 
he said.

PAROLED FELON PLEADS NOT GUILTY IN WONG SLAYING; COURTS: EDWARD MORGAN IS 
ARRAIGNED ON CAPITAL CHARGES OF SEXUAL ASSAULT AND MURDER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Paroled rapist Edward Patrick Morgan pleaded not guilty Friday to sexually 
assaulting and murdering a young Huntington Beach woman in a case that has 
sparked public outcry over the handling of his prior criminal cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan, 28, was arraigned on capital charges in connection with the May 20 
slaying of 23-year-old Leanora Annette Wong, 23, whose battered body was found 
in a parking lot across the street from the Australian Beach Restaurant and 
Nightclub in Orange. Prosecutors have also said Wong was raped with a foreign 
object. 
</P>
<P>
 Morgan's defense attorney said he doubts the Orange County district attorney's 
office can fairly evaluate whether to seek the death penalty against Morgan. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're concerned that they're going to feel that they have to seek the death 
penalty in this case because of the public outcry that's been generated by the 
media coverage," Deputy Public Defender Steve J. Biskar said outside of court. 
"We are concerned about the D.A.'s ability to evaluate this in a neutral and 
unbiased manner." 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Lewis R. Rosenblum told reporters the public's response to 
the case has had no impact on his office's handling of it. Rosenblum said 
Morgan will be treated as "any other defendant" who faces capital charges, 
despite the close media attention. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are fair and unbiased in each and every one of our cases," Rosenblum said. 
"This case, as every other case, will be fairly and vigorously prosecuted." 
</P>
<P>
 After Morgan's arrest in Northern California, it was revealed that Morgan had 
been accused of raping four young Orange County women in the last decade. In 
all but one of the cases, however, the Orange County district attorney's office 
either declined to prosecute or allowed Morgan to plead guilty to less serious 
charges. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say the credibility of the victims posed a problem in those cases. 
But critics say prosecutors should have pursued the investigations more 
vigorously because the repeated allegations indicate Morgan is a chronic sex 
offender. 
</P>
<P>
 An analysis of state figures also shows that Dist. Atty. Michael R. Capizzi's 
office has the worst record among prosecutors in the state's six most populous 
counties for seeking the harshest punishment in rape cases. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong was seen talking to Morgan -- a handsome former high school wrestler -- 
at the nightclub on the night of her murder. 
</P>
<P>
 Biskar also complained outside of court about media reports that video cameras 
in the parking lot captured portions of the brutal crime and crime scene. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have information that the videotape, and what it shows, is not what has 
been portrayed in the media," Biskar said. "We are concerned that the case is 
being tried by the press, rather than the court." 
</P>
<P>
 Also arraigned Friday was Donna Tatum of Ontario, who pleaded not guilty to 
aiding and abetting Morgan after the murder. Tatum also pleaded not guilty and 
has been released on $10,000 bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Tatum contends that she drove Morgan out of the area because she feared he 
would kill her if she did not follow his orders. Morgan was later arrested in 
the Northern California town of Quincy.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; FORUM TO EXAMINE POLICE HARASSMENT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Alliance Working for Asian Rights and Empowerment, or AWARE, will hold a 
forum today on the rights of citizens who are detained or questioned by police. 
</P>
<P>
 People who say they are victims of police harassment, attorneys and 
representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union will be featured speakers 
at the "Copwatch Forum" at the Vietnamese Community of Southern California, 
15361 Brookhurst St. in Westminster. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to educate and inform our youth and parents of our community about 
police harassment -- what it is, and what to do about it," said JoAnn Kanshige, 
co-founder of AWARE. 
</P>
<P>
 The speakers will present a discussion titled: "Guilty by Appearance: Gang 
Hysteria, Mug Files and Youth Rights." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, Kanshige will share her family's experiences with alleged police 
abuse and her attempts to stop the Fountain Valley Police Department from 
photographing youths for gang mug files. 
</P>
<P>
 Parent Kim Ha is scheduled to describe the book she is writing, which details 
her family's encounters with what she says is police harassment. 
</P>
<P>
 Quyen Pham, a 16-year-old Tustin High School honors student, will describe how 
she and two friends were photographed by police while they waited for a ride 
home in front of a Garden Grove mini-mall restaurant last year. The photos, 
taken in July, are still stored in police files. 
</P>
<P>
 As a result, the ACLU recently filed a class-action federal lawsuit against 
the Garden Grove Police Department, challenging its strategy of photographing 
youths who fit a certain gang profile. 
</P>
<P>
 "We believe that good policing does not require creating mug files of innocent 
people," said Daniel C. Tsang, co-founder of AWARE. 
</P>
<P>
 "Culturally, the Asian community does not speak out against such things as 
police harassment," Kanshige said. "By nature, our people do not complain or 
report abuse, so by having some speak out, we hope to encourage others to do 
the same." 
</P>
<P>
 The forum will be held between 1 p.m. and 3 p.m. MIMI KO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; COUNCIL OKS CHURCH USE OF SCHOOL SITE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After months of delay, the First Chinese Baptist Church will finally get to 
move into its new home. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council Tuesday denied an appeal filed by a resident and ruled that 
the church can operate at 16835 Brookhurst St., a former private school.  
</P>
<P>
 Council members unanimously supported the Planning Commission's April 27 
approval of a special city permit to allow the church to occupy the site. 
</P>
<P>
 The church plans to hold worship services, Bible study and prayer meetings as 
well as offer programs for youth groups and English as a second language 
classes. The church will also remodel the interiors of existing buildings and 
construct a new parking lot. 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Alex Gilbert, who filed the appeal, also filed a lawsuit last year 
alleging that the city violated environmental review procedures for the church 
proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, church officials applied for city permission to move the growing 
congregation to Brookhurst Street because of its need for a larger facility. 
</P>
<P>
 But after planning commissioners gave approval, another resident sought to 
overturn that decision and filed an appeal to the council.  
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing last September, the council upheld the Planning Commission's 
decision to give the church approval to move to the site. Following that 
decision, Gilbert filed the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 In January, the lawsuit was dismissed by a Superior Court judge after church 
officials agreed to relinquish the approved city permit and reapply for 
permission to move their church to the four-acre property. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor John J. Collins said exhaustive traffic and environmental studies for 
the church proposal have been conducted and that the project meets city and 
state codes. 
</P>
<P>
 Gilbert, who lives near the proposed church site, told council members that he 
objected to the church approval for a number of reasons. Gilbert said he 
believes an environmental impact report was necessary instead of the less 
extensive environmental review process that was done. 
</P>
<P>
 Some residents of the area told the council Tuesday that traffic would 
increase and pose a danger to children if church members use residential 
streets. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins said there will be no access into the neighborhood from the church 
parking lot. Access into the church parking lot will be provided only from 
Brookhurst Street. 
</P>
<P>
 Residents who live on nearby Mariposa Avenue also expressed a desire to close 
that street to limit traffic because motorists use the street as a short 
cut.DEBRA CANO

 Knott's Berry Farm becomes a Philippine town today and Sunday when the theme 
park presents "Fiesta Filipiana," featuring Filipino food, music, and 
entertainment. 
</P>
<P>
 About 25,000 Filipino Americans from around Southern California are expected 
to attend the two-day event, which is being held as part of the celebration of 
Philippine Independence Day on Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 Entertainers from the Manila and Los Angeles areas will perform, including Kuh 
Ledesma, formerly one of the Philippines' top entertainers and now based in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a watershed event for Filipino Americans," said Feling Timbancaya, 
one of the event organizers. "We have been labeled as the invisible minority in 
America, but this is our chance to show our culture." 
</P>
<P>
 The Southern California Filipino-American Community and the Philippine 
Department of Tourism are sponsoring the event, Timbancaya said 
</P>
<P>
 A 50-member troupe from Los Angeles will perform during in a show called 
"Kasaysayan ng Lahi," which depicts Filipino culture through music, dances and 
a fashion show. 
</P>
<P>
 A highlight for each evening will be the "Santacruzan," in which Filipina 
beauty queens, dressed in traditional gowns, and their escorts re-enact a 
religious procession that caps harvest festivities in many Philippine towns. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the cultural presentations, there will be food booths around 
the park where people can sample native cakes, pastries and delicacies prepared 
by Filipino restaurants in Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
 Opening ceremonies are scheduled at 11 a.m. today, with representatives from 
the Philippine Consulate in Los Angeles and Buena Park city officials. Tickets 
are $26.95 for adults and $15.95 for children 3-11.BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; PARENTS STILL KEEP CHILDREN FROM CLASS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Circle View Elementary School returned to normal Friday, a day after three 
dozen sign-wielding parents protested 6-year-old Jimmy Peters' return to 
kindergarten under orders of a federal court judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy arrived at 10:50 a.m. Friday along with his father, Jim Peters, in time 
for recess. He stayed until 11:20, when class ended. But unlike Thursday, there 
were no reporters and no angry parents to greet him. 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy is at the center of a bitter legal dispute that has pitted the Ocean 
View School District against him and sparked strong protests from some parents 
over other children in his class. 
</P>
<P>
 The district filed an unprecedented lawsuit against Jimmy May 25, requesting 
that he be indefinitely barred from class because he allegedly kicked and bit 
other classmates and disrupted the learning environment. 
</P>
<P>
 But Wednesday, U.S. District Court Judge Matthew Byrne rejected the request, 
ruling that the injuries Jimmy had allegedly caused his teacher and other 
children were not serious enough to warrant his exclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Peters, who denies those allegations, refused to voluntarily transfer his 
son to a special education classroom, prompting the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday was Jimmy's second day back in school since May 19, when he was 
suspended for allegedly biting a teacher. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View Supt. James Tarwater said only 18 of the 31 children enrolled in 
Jimmy's class were present Friday. Most of the absent children were kept home 
by parents to protest Jimmy's return, Tarwater said, but he could not provide a 
precise number. On Thursday, 17 children were in class and all but two of the 
absences were the result of parent protests. 
</P>
<P>
 Some parents, however, have supported Jimmy's return to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not surprised more students didn't come back because of the circus thing 
yesterday," Tarwater said. "But overall, I'd say things were calm today." JAIME

 About 200 children will receive free dental care today at Roosevelt Elementary 
School as part of Healthy Tomorrows, a school district program that offers 
preventive health care. 
</P>
<P>
 Four volunteer dentists will fill cavities and clean teeth, as well as refer 
children who need additional treatment for free follow-up visits.The value of 
the donated services is estimated at about $20,000, said Diane Thomas, 
spokeswoman for the Santa Ana Unified School District. 
</P>
<P>
 Children scheduled to receive treatment include those from Martin R. Heninger, 
John F. Kennedy and Roosevelt elementary schools. The service will be provided 
from 7:30 a.m. to noon at the Roosevelt campus, 501 S. Halladay St. 
</P>
<P>
 Bilingual parent education sessions will also be provided, and all health care 
services provided by Healthy Tomorrows are contingent on parental consent.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: FOUNTAIN VALLEY; COX STUDENT TEAMS WIN NASA CONTEST 
</P>

<P>
 Their mission aboard spaceship Rock Crusher 2001 was to travel to distant 
planets and find new sources of energy for a world running out of gas and oil. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission accomplished. 
</P>
<P>
 Along the way, the expedition earned these six young, would-be rocket 
scientists at the James H. Cox School top awards in the 1994 NASA National 
Science contest. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're so thrilled," said the third-graders' teacher, Leigh Hoven-Severson, 
whose students competed against thousands of third- to fifth-graders from 
across the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the contest rules, students were required to explain how their project 
would benefit humankind. 
</P>
<P>
 "They learned to work together and share ideas, and secondly, they really got 
a vision of how in the future they could help the world," said Hoven-Severson, 
a 27-year teacher who has taught at Cox School for the past decade. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the teams of three placed first in a state competition and second in 
the nation. Another three-member team won second place in the state contest. 
</P>
<P>
 The students will be recognized during a school ceremony Tuesday and awards 
will be presented to them by a scientist from the McDonnell Douglas Corp., 
Hoven-Severson said. 
</P>
<P>
 The project that won top state honors was created by Laith Oweini, Steven Chen 
and Himani Amoli. Their spacecraft, called Rock Crusher 2001, was to go to Mars 
to search for alternative energy sources because Earth is depleting its supply 
of oil and gas. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven, 8, said the spacecraft has living space for eight astronauts and four 
robots and is equipped with a science lab and an exercise room. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you're in space, you still need to exercise so when you go back to Earth 
you don't get weak," he explained. 
</P>
<P>
 Laith, 9, said he would consider becoming an astronaut and wouldn't mind 
taking a flight in their creation. Steven, however, said he'd never want to 
ride in the spacecraft because "I'm scared to go to Mars." 
</P>
<P>
 The second-place state winners created Space Station Genesis, designed to 
explore Jupiter's moons for life as well as information for future explorers. 
</P>
<P>
 Jun Huang, 9, Evan Tsutsumida, 8, and Therese Catanach, 8, created a 
spacecraft with a garden, pool, pool table and video games.DEBRA CANO

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; SOME BUS ROUTES TO BE ELIMINATED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By H.G. REZA 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some bus routes will be discontinued or will reduce service beginning Sunday 
because of low ridership, Orange County Transportation Authority officials 
said. Most of the changes will be on coastal routes. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, transit authorities said they will expand service on two 
more popular routes because of increased demand. 
</P>
<P>
 SuperBus service is being introduced on Route 85, from Santa Ana to San 
Clemente, and on Express Route 205, from San Juan Capistrano to Irvine. The 
service uses a truck and trailer, which can carry a larger number of 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
 The service reductions will affect Route 53, Orange to Balboa; Route 64, Santa 
Ana to Seal Beach; and Route 70, Santa Ana to Sunset Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 While Route 85 is getting the SuperBus for its run from Santa Ana to San 
Clemente, the number of trips between Santa Ana and Laguna Hills will be 
reduced. 
</P>
<P>
 Route 65, which runs from Santa Ana to Balboa, will be rerouted through the 
Tustin Market Place. 
</P>
<P>
 Route 73, which originates in Brea and ends in Irvine, will be renumbered 
Commuter Service Route 373. The time schedules will remain the same, but riders 
will now be carried in mini buses. 
</P>
<P>
 The discontinued routes are Route 92, Laguna Hills to Mission Viejo; Route 
310, Huntington Beach to Long Beach; Route 311A, Huntington Beach to Santa Ana, 
and Route 315, Mission Viejo to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning July 1, bus riders will be able to transfer up to two times free, 
but transfers from Amtrak to buses will cost 50 cents. Metrolink transfers will 
still be free. The transportation authority will also sell a book of 10 ride 
coupons for $9.H.G. REZA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COUNTYWIDE; COSTA MESAN NAMED TO OPTOMETRY BOARD 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Gov. Pete Wilson appointed a Costa Mesa man Friday to the state Board of 
Optometry. 
</P>
<P>
 Steven Grant is a 49-year-old optometrist who has been practicing since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
 The state Board of Optometry regulates more than 7,200 licensed optometrists 
and 400 optometric corporations in California. Its members are not paid and do 
not require state Senate confirmation.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA NIGUEL; COUNCIL OKS PLAN FOR DAY-CARE CENTER 
</P>

<P>
 A proposal to open a Montessori preschool and day-care center has received the 
final approval from the City Council over the objections of neighbors worried 
about increased traffic and proper use of land designated as open space. 
</P>
<P>
 The council voted 3 to 1 Tuesday to allow Bettencourt & Associates to place 
the 162-student school in the planned Beacon Hill Commercial Center at Ridgeway 
Avenue and Niguel Road. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision came after a three-hour public hearing in which members of the 
Beacon Hills Homeowners' Assn. argued that building the 7,000-square-foot 
school in the middle of a residential neighborhood would cause traffic to stack 
up on Niguel and Ridgeway. 
</P>
<P>
 The matter had come before the council because the homeowners' association 
appealed the Planning Commission's earlier approval of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Patricia C. Bates was the only council member to vote against the 
school plan. She said she hoped homeowners and Bettencourt & Associates could 
work out their differences through another month of talks. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Janet Godfrey and Councilmen Thomas W. Wilson and Mark Goodman voted in 
favor of the school. They agreed with a city recommendations that the increased 
traffic would not be disastrous for the community and that the use of "public 
space" as a private school playground was appropriate. LYNN FRANEY

<P>
 A family of birds is the first to enjoy an $800,000 home under construction at 
a Newport Coast Drive development. 
</P>
<P>
 A plastering crew found the birds nesting this week under the eaves of the 
house in the Santa Lucia development.The job could not be finished without 
removing the nest. 
</P>
<P>
 The crew elected to leave a hole for the young birds to use while they grow 
up, said Gary Simpson of Laguna Plastering. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're chirping in there, and they're probably getting close to getting out 
of there," he said. "All the guys got together and decided not to kill the 
birds and let them live." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said his crew will come back and finish the job this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's really wonderful," said Susan Shook, a vice president at RGC, the 
Newport Beach developer of the project. 
</P>
<P>
 She said RGC had not been told of the plastering crew's decision but is happy 
to let the birds stay at the house for a couple months. No one plans to move 
into the four-bedroom home until August, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said the eaves of the house were plastered to help keep the building 
from catching fire in a wildfire. WILLSON CUMMER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: YORBA LINDA; HOBBY TO ONE MAY BE ANOTHER'S EYESORE

 Kay Bagley calls the collection of boxes, wood and other materials on her side 
yard and back yard a hobby. But her neighbors and the city call it a health and 
fire hazard. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1990, city officials have been trying to get Raymond and Kay Bagley to 
clean up their property, with only minimum, short-term results. The efforts 
escalated this week when the City Council conducted a public hearing to 
consider whether the property is a public nuisance. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite hearing a code enforcement officer and several neighbors testify that 
pressure from the city has only resulted in the materials being moved from one 
spot to another, the council on Tuesday decided to give the Bagleys another 
month to clean up the property and offered the assistance of city employees to 
haul away items. 
</P>
<P>
 But even as the city was offering her time and help, Kay Bagley indicated the 
situation was not going to be easily resolved. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may not agree on what is debris and what is good plywood for bookshelves," 
Bagley said. 
</P>
<P>
 Soon after the Bagleys moved into the 2,500 square-foot house five years ago, 
neighbors on Candle Light Lane began complaining about the collection of boxes, 
wood, paper and other items accumulating in the Bagleys' front yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The rear portion of the Bagleys' half-acre lot is surrounded by chain-link 
fence. Behind their property is a horse trail and a narrow private street, 
Nutmeg Lane. Houses on Nutmeg Lane face the Bagleys' back yard and are about 
three feet higher in elevation. 
</P>
<P>
 "We look right down into their back yard," said Mary Felix, who lives directly 
behind the Bagleys. "Since moving in 1 1/2 years ago, we've slowly watched this 
stuff creep up to the fence." 
</P>
<P>
 The Bagleys' back yard resembles a lumber yard, with at least a dozen piles 
several feet high of plywood and scrap wood, boxes, file cabinets and other 
objects stretching from the house to several feet away from the chain-link 
fence. 
</P>
<P>
 Bagley said she is saving the wood to build book cases for her collection of 
several thousand books. The boxes and piles of paper, which she salvages from 
print shops, are being saved to donate to local preschools. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I began to see (the paper)going to waste, while schools were crying 
about not having enough money for art supplies, I put the two together," Bagley 
said.  
</P>
<P>
 If the city declares the Bagleys' property a public nuisance, the couple will 
have 30 days to clean up the property. After that, if city officials are not 
satisfied, they will send workers to complete the job and bill the Bagleys for 
the labor. DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BREA; COUNCIL WEIGHING PUBLIC INPUT LIMITS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After hearing a barrage of angry comments from residents, the City Council 
decided this week to delay action on a resolution that would restrict public 
input at council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Mayor Glenn G. Parker said the main reason for the postponement was that Gene 
Leyton, a member of the city's Redevelopment Agency, was unavailable for the 
council debate Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The issue needs full participation," said Parker, who indicated that the 
matter is scheduled for the June 21 council agenda. He said he has not decided 
whether to vote for or against the proposal. 
</P>
<P>
 If adopted, the resolution would limit the public comment portions of council 
meetings to two 30-minute periods. One would be at the beginning of the meeting 
so the public could address agenda items and other topics, and the other would 
come after the agenda had been completed. 
</P>
<P>
 This change is being contemplated, according to city staff, to enhance the 
council's ability to conduct business at regular meetings. 
</P>
<P>
 Public input at the twice-monthly meetings often exceeds the proposed time 
limit, as residents step forward to voice concerns about the city's hotly 
debated downtown redevelopment project and other local issues. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those speaking against a time limit was resident Karen Vega, who charged 
that council members are considering the resolution because they are tired of 
hearing negative comments from the public. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our City Council only wishes to hear the positive," said Vega, who warned 
that "any restrictions on our First Amendment rights will not go unchallenged." 
</P>
<P>
 Also speaking out against time restrictions was her husband, William Vega, who 
is among the council candidates in the November election. He emphasized that 
the council exists to serve the residents -- not vice versa. 
</P>
<P>
 "People need to feel like they own this city again," he said. "We own it -- 
not those who serve." 
</P>
<P>
 Resident Carl Nolte was also critical of the proposed resolution, calling it a 
"gag rule" on the public. "Stifle freedom of speech and you stifle progress," 
he said.ALAN EYERLY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; CITY GETS WINDFALL FROM PENSION FUND 
</P>

 City officials are considering how to spend an unexpected $13.7-million 
surplus from the Public Employees Retirement System. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the surplus money will not be used to close a $9-million 
shortfall in the city's $137-million general fund budget.To make up the 
shortfall, the city has proposed cutting 16 jobs and imposing a utility fee 
against the city-owned Public Utility Department. 
</P>
<P>
 City Manager James D. Ruth recommended that the council put the $9.6 million 
into a reserve account. 
</P>
<P>
 Ruth said the money could help cushion possible financial blows, such as an 
unexpectedly low allotment of state money. 
</P>
<P>
 If the money is not needed to cover shortfalls in state funding, it could be 
used for capital improvements, Ruth said. The city may also channel part of the 
surplus to a reserve fund especially for the Anaheim Convention Center. 
</P>
<P>
 Because of PERS policy and state laws, only $9.6 million of the $13.7 million 
will be available to the city during fiscal year 1994-95, city officials said. 
It was not clear whether the remaining $4.1 million will be made available to 
the city next year, or whether PERS will lower its rates to balance city 
accounts, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials said the surplus was created by better-than-expected returns on PERS 
investments in recent years, plus a series of wage freezes on city employees. 
</P>
<P>
 The City Council is expected to decide how it will spend the PERS surplus when 
it votes June 21 on the 1994-95 budget. 
</P>
<P>
 The last time the city had a PERS surplus was three years ago when it received 
about $13 million. MARTIN MILLER

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA HILLS; TRAIL CAUSED SLIDE, HOMEOWNER CLAIMS

<P>
 The owner of a Nellie Gail Ranch custom home is seeking $3 million in a 
lawsuit against the property developer, claiming that the creation of a horse 
trail contributed to a serious mudslide in his back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 The suit, filed Thursday in Orange County Superior Court, by Mike Akrawi 
contends that the Presley Cos. and the Nellie Gail Ranch Owners Assn. were 
negligent in cutting the horse trail into his back yard hillside.He alleges 
that the trail destabilized the steep slope and caused the dirt to slide during 
heavy rains in January, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 "The ranch owners association came every year with a tractor and cut further 
into the hillside to maintain the trail," said Jennifer Hasso-Najm, Akrawi's 
attorney. "So when the rains came, it became so saturated that all the dirt 
came down." 
</P>
<P>
 She said Akrawi spent a large amount of money to repair the damage. But she 
declined to say how much was spent. The slide did not present a danger to the 
home itself, she added. 
</P>
<P>
 Rich Wilson, the manager of the owners association, said the mudslide at 
Akrawi's home in the 25000 block of Nellie Gail Road resulted from "other 
things, such as improper drainage caused by Mr. Akrawi," not the creation of 
the horse trail. 
</P>
<P>
 He said several other Nellie Gail Ranch properties also experienced minor 
mudslides during the rainstorms. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was typical California mud," Wilson said. He said mudslides on hillsides 
should be expected. 
</P>
<P>
 The Presley Cos.' lawyer declined to comment on the lawsuit Friday.LYNN FRANEY

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: COSTA MESA; FAIRGROUNDS BUFFALO GETS INDIAN NAME

 The bison born at the county fairgrounds finally has a name: Tatonka. 
</P>
<P>
 The name was selected from more than 1,000 suggestions made as part of a 
christening contest run by the fairgrounds.Tatonka was born May 11 to Becky, a 
bison refugee from the Buffalo Ranch in Irvine, which closed earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buffy" was the name suggested most, perhaps because for the first 20 days of 
the animal's life he was thought by livestock caretakers to be female. No one 
could get close enough to be sure because Becky growled in warning, explained 
fair spokeswoman Georgia Cluver. 
</P>
<P>
 Finally, nature called attention to the animal's gender. "We saw the way it 
relieved itself, and it relieved itself like a male," Cluver said. 
</P>
<P>
 Suggestions for the animal's name poured in from around the Southland and as 
far away as Japan, Cluver said. The panel of four judges plugged their ears to 
the choruses of "Buffy" and picked "Tatonka." It's a Native American word for 
bison that was used in the film "Dances With Wolves," Cluver said Thursday when 
the name was announced. 
</P>
<P>
 Becky and Tatonka live on Centennial Farm, a small working farm at the 
fairgrounds.WILLSON CUMMER

JURY CLEARS OFFICER IN SHOOTING; COURTS: VERDICT THAT ANAHEIM PATROLMAN USED 
REASONABLE FORCE SENDS DEAD MAN'S FAMILY INTO SECLUSION. SOME JURORS UPSET TO 
LEARN IT WAS HIS FOURTH KILLING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 An Anaheim police officer used reasonable force when he shot and killed aman 
from Orange in 1989 following a high-speed chase, an Orange County Superior 
Court jury ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The case involved veteran Officer Lee Smith, described by some as a consummate 
cop, but by others as a controversial figure who fatally shot four people 
within a three-year period. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith had been accused in a wrongful death lawsuit of using excessive force in 
the shooting of Robert Vincent Edson, a 28-year-old motorist who sped away when 
police tried to pull him over for driving without headlights. The suit, filed 
by Edson's widow and children, also named the city of Anaheim as a defendant. 
</P>
<P>
 After 2 1/2 days of deliberation, jurors decided by a 9-3 vote that Smith used 
reasonable force in the shooting, clearing the officer and the city of any 
wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial involved only the Edson shooting, and evidence about the other three 
subsequent shootings involving Smith was not allowed before jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's obviously very pleased with the verdict and pleased that his name is now 
cleared 100%," said attorney Bruce Praet, who represented Smith and the city in 
the case. "Of course, he still feels badly for the family, as do we." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Frank Barbaro, who represented Edson's wife, two children and a 
stepchild in the suit, said he was shocked by the verdict. He contended that 
Smith used poor judgment in firing at an unarmed man, and that Edson never 
posed a threat to the officer. 
</P>
<P>
 The verdict sent Edson's wife, Allison Lynn, and family into seclusion, 
Barbaro said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what else we could have done in this case," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One juror, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said he voted with the 
majority of the jury based on the evidence presented and rules outlining 
reasonable force, but was upset to hear later of the other shootings. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was very hard on the jurors to come to that conclusion," the juror said. 
"Our heart was in one place and the letter of the law and the instructions were 
in another place. Of course when we learned afterward outside (of the other 
shootings), that didn't help either." 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike criminal cases, a verdict in civil trials does not have to be 
unanimous. 
</P>
<P>
 During the three-week trial before Superior Court Judge Robert J. Polis, 
colleagues and supporters characterized Smith, a 10-year veteran of the 
department, as a consummate cop whose gang-busting efforts earned him this 
year's Anaheim Police Officer of the Year award from a local community group. 
He remains on active duty, his lawyer said. 
</P>
<P>
 The trial was the final legal action hanging over Smith for any of the 
shootings, Praet said. The officer has been cleared of criminal wrongdoing by 
the district attorney's office, the FBI and the U.S. Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim Mayor Tom Daly said the verdict came as "great news." 
</P>
<P>
 "It's good to see a peace officer exonerated by a jury of citizens of a 
serious charge like this," Daly said. "Police officers everywhere are under 
such scrutiny and are expected to be almost superhuman under very difficult 
circumstances." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Anaheim City Atty. Jack L. White: "It not only exonerates Officer Smith 
but certainly exonerates the city of Anaheim in regards to its policies and 
training and hiring of police officers." 
</P>
<P>
 At the time of his death on Feb. 2, 1989, Edson, who ran a struggling ticket 
service for concerts and sporting events, was living with his wife and stepson 
at the Galaxy Motor Inn near Disneyland, after the family was evicted from 
their apartment in Orange because they couldn't pay the rent. 
</P>
<P>
 Shortly after midnight, Edson had left the motel to pick up some shampoo for 
his wife. While returning, he sped away when officers tried to stop him for 
driving without headlights, sparking a 14-minute high-speed chase back to the 
motel, according to trial testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Smith pursued Edson to the motel where the officer fired at least eight shots 
at the suspect, hitting him once. Police officials said the man appeared to 
reach for a weapon from his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbaro said Edson was pounding on the door for his wife to let him in and 
posed no threat to the officer. Edson sped away from police because he was 
driving on a suspended license and was afraid of going to jail, Barbaro said.

BICYCLIST DIES AFTER BEING STRUCK BY MINIVAN

 A 57-year-old bicyclist died Friday of head wounds after he apparently ran a 
red light and was hit by a minivan, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vinh Van Luu of Santa Ana was eastbound on Willits Street about 5:30 a.m. when 
he was struck by the minivan northbound on Fairview Street, Sgt. Dick Faust

PANEL CALLS FOR PROBE INTO NURSING HOME REGULATORS' JOB PERFORMANCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Following five hours of often heart-wrenching testimony, a fact-finding panel 
Friday called for an investigation into whether state nursing home regulators 
in Orange County are doing an adequate job. 
</P>
<P>
 Advocates for nursing home patients contended during a hearing here that the 
Orange County district office of the state Department of Health Services, which 
licenses and regulates the county's 76 skilled nursing homes, has fallen behind 
the rest of the state in enforcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Patricia McGinnis, president of California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform, 
quoted a statewide study conducted by her organization that showed state 
regulators in Orange County issued only two citations and $7,500 in fines in 
1992, while in Santa Clara County, which has fewer nursing homes, regulators 
issued 162 citations and more than $350,000 in fines. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Jacqueline A. Lincer, chief of the Department of Health Services 
office in Anaheim, explained that in 1992 she decided to cope with an 
overwhelming workload by instructing her staff to write fewer citations. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincer said that instead of issuing citations, her office punished errant 
nursing homes by removing the certification that enables them to bill Medi-Cal 
and Medicare. Decertification, she said, is a quicker and more effective remedy 
than citations and fines, which are often delayed for years in the appeals 
process. In 1992, she said, the decertifications in Orange County far outpaced 
other parts of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 "Decertification is 10 times worse than a citation," agreed Kathy Byrne, 
spokeswoman for the California Assn. of Health Facilities, which contends that 
regulators in Orange County are just as tough on nursing homes as they are in 
the rest of the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Lincer said the state Department of Health Services in Sacramento sent a team 
to investigate complaints about her office. "At the end of the review, I was 
told we were doing it the way it was supposed to be done," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 However, she added, the office also has stepped up the writing of citations 
since October, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 At the end of Friday's five-hour hearing, the fact-finding panel called for 
the state auditor general to investigate whether state regulators in Orange 
County are doing an adequate job in protecting patients. The panel was chaired 
by Assemblyman Gil Ferguson (R-Newport Beach), whose district includes the 
Leisure World retirement community. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said the panel, which also included Assemblymen Mickey Conroy 
(R-Orange) and Tom Umberg (D-Garden Grove), former Assemblywoman Marian 
LaFollette and Richard R. Terzian, chairman of the state's Little Hoover 
Commission, also would push for reform legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Ferguson said he learned that laws are needed to protect nursing home 
employees who file complaints against their employers and to enable nursing 
homes to share information about the prior abuse record of job applicants. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the nearly two dozen people who testified was Diane S. Sandell, founder 
of a volunteer organization that advocates better nursing home care. Sandell 
said her mother was severely beaten twice in the night in 1988 when she was 
living at a nursing home in Orange, but there was no citation or fine levied 
against the facility. 
</P>
<P>
 Nursing home officials acknowledged that there are abuses in their industry. 
However, they argued that the solution is not to add regulations but to improve 
the screening and training of nursing home personnel.

TEEN-AGE KILLER OF STUDENT FACES OCTOBER SENTENCING; COURT: MIGUEL CAMARENA 
WILL UNDERGO EVALUATION. HE FACES LIFE IN PRISON WITHOUT PAROLE IN GRUDGE 
KILLING NEAR CENTURY HIGH. 
</P>

<P>
 A teen-ager convicted of shooting another youth to death near Century High 
School -- a killing that came to symbolize senseless gang violence on city 
streets -- will be sentenced in October after he undergoes an evaluation at the 
California Youth Authority, a judge ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Miguel Camarena, 19, faces life in prison without the possibility of parole 
for the Feb. 26, 1993, murder of Jose Luis Lopez, a 17-year-old varsity soccer 
player who was shot in the head as he drove to school in Santa Ana. 
</P>
<P>
 During a brief hearing, Superior Court Judge James A. Jackman ordered Camarena 
to undergo a sentencing evaluation at the CYA. He will be back in court for 
sentencing Oct. 14. 
</P>
<P>
 Such an evaluation is required by law because Camarena was a juvenile when the 
murder took place. He was ordered to stand trial as an adult. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Public Defender James Appel has said he hopes his client will be spared 
state prison and be sentenced instead to the CYA, where juvenile defendants can 
be held until they reach age 25. 
</P>
<P>
 A Superior Court jury took only two hours in April to convict Camarena of 
first-degree murder, of lying in wait for his victim, and of committing a 
gang-related crime. Jurors rejected defense arguments that Camarena is mentally 
retarded and never intended to kill Lopez. 
</P>
<P>
 Two days before the shooting, Camarena had lost a fistfight with the victim's 
brother, Adrian Lopez, according to court testimony. 
</P>
<P>
 Deputy Dist. Atty. Marc Rozenberg said the victim watched the fight but did 
not participate. Even though Camarena's gripe was with Adrian Lopez, he shot 
Jose Lopez as "pay back," a key tenet of street justice that pushes gang 
members to take action against perceived wrongs, the prosecutor charged.

ROBBERY THWARTED AT LIQUOR STORE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two plainclothes police officers cut short an armed robbery by suspected gang 
members at a liquor store early Friday, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 While on a break at 1 a.m., officers Frank Gordon and Evan Sailor entered the 
Bal-Harbor liquor store in the 500 block of East Balboa Boulevard.Inside the 
store, police said, Gordon noticed a teen-ager standing near the cash register 
take a pistol out of his waistband. 
</P>
<P>
 However, when a second teen-ager -- apparently acting as a lookout just inside 
the front door -- signaled the arrival of another customer, the young man near 
the cash register returned his gun to his waistband, Gordon said. 
</P>
<P>
 Gordon signaled Sailer what was going on, and the two officers then drew their 
own weapons and stepped behind the suspected robbers and two suspected 
accomplices, ordering them to surrender, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Three of the youths complied, but the lookout fled to a nearby parking lot 
where he was captured by other officers alerted by the officers inside the 
store. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arrested were identified as members of a San Bernardino street gang. 
They included: Agustin Mesa and Manuel Leyva, both 18 and from San Bernardino; 
a 16-year-old boy from Rialto and a 14-year-old girl from Colton. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the adults was being held in lieu of posting $50,000 bail at the 
Newport Beach Police Department jail facility, and the two juveniles were 
released to their parents, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police said that in addition to a pistol recovered from Mesa, officers found a 
second pistol in the group's car.

2 SANTA ANA MEN HELD IN COCAINE CASE 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal officials arrested four people Friday, including two from Santa Ana, 
on suspicion of conspiracy to distribute 400 kilograms of cocaine, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A fifth suspect was arrested on a related weapons charge, and a sixth is 
believed to be at large in Mexico, according to Assistant U.S. Atty.Nick Hanna. 
</P>
<P>
 The arrests were a result of an investigation by the Southern California Drug 
Task Force, a joint federal, state and local law enforcement agency that 
includes the Orange County Sheriff's Department. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 386 kilograms of cocaine were smuggled into Southern California from 
Mexico, according to Hanna, and distributed throughout the United States, to 
such places as Santa Fe Springs, Boise, Idaho; Minneapolis, Minn.; and Vermont. 
The same suspects have been linked to a May 15, 1993, seizure of approximately 
$5 million in cash from a home and vehicle in Baldwin Park, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Those arrested on the federal charges were identified as Ramon Ruiz-Ojeda, 26, 
and Jose Ricardo Loaiza, 29, both of Santa Ana; and Jose Ruiz-Zavala, 43, and 
Maria Concepcion Herrera, both of Diamond Bar. 
</P>
<P>
 Lamberto Recio-Godoy, of Culiacan, Mexico, is still at large. Martin Antonio 
Coronel-Lopez, of Covina, was arrested on state charges of possessing an 
unregistered assault weapon.

RULING COULD SLOW LOCAL PHONE COMPETITION; COMMUNICATIONS: FEDERAL APPEALS 
COURT SAYS FCC CAN'T FORCE BABY BELLS TO GIVE RIVALS SPACE INSIDE THEIR CENTRAL 
OFFICES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Federal Communications Commission cannot force local phone companies to 
give rivals space inside their central offices to hook up independent phone 
networks, a federal appeals court ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The ruling, which some saw as slowing competition in local phone services, was 
a victory for the regional Bell companies, which have been fighting with 
so-called competitive access providers for some time over lucrative business 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Basically, the new competitors have been able to set up their equipment in 
phone company offices in order to route their calls directly to the local phone 
network. They can then sell cut-rate phone services to business customers, who 
account for the lion's share of phone spending. 
</P>
<P>
 The court ruling, if it stands, means the competitive access providers will 
probably have to set up shop outside central phone company offices, which would 
raise their costs and reduce their competitive advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 California, along with many other states and the federal government, has been 
trying to promote local-service competition as a way of giving consumers and 
businesses greater choices and lower prices. 
</P>
<P>
 Regulators also hope greater competition will promote development of the 
highly touted information superhighway. 
</P>
<P>
 This ruling is not expected to halt the inevitable march toward greater 
competition, but it does puts pressure on Congress and the FCC to write new 
rules governing competition. Those rules now could more strongly favor the Baby 
Bells. 
</P>
<P>
 Also, some analysts suggest, the Baby Bells now might have more leverage in 
their efforts to enter long-distance phone service and compete in cable 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Associated Press quoted a senior FCC official as saying the agency will 
challenge the ruling, although a lawyer for the FCC said late Friday that the 
agency's general counsel was still reviewing the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Court of Appeals ruling in Washington came after six of the seven 
Baby Bells and several other local telephone concerns sued the FCC, arguing 
that granting space in their central offices to competitive access providers 
would compromise phone company security and amount to a taking of property in 
violation of the U.S. Constitution. 
</P>
<P>
 "The court viewed this as a disruption of central offices, which are the nerve 
centers of telephone company operations and a key to maintaining the security 
and reliability of the network," said Mark L. Evans, who represented the Baby 
Bells and the other plaintiffs. 
</P>
<P>
 The court struck down a 2-year-old FCC rule requiring local phone companies to 
make space available for equipment needed to connect their customers' calls to 
the local telephone exchange, saying federal law "does not expressly authorize" 
such action. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is a serious setback for competition," said Bradley Stilman, legislative 
director for the Consumer Federation of America, a Washington advocacy group. 
"It gives greater control to the local phone company and hinders the ability of 
others to compete." 
</P>
<P>
 Central office equipment rooms are usually tightly secured areas where network 
switches are often individually partitioned and segregated with locked chain 
link fences to thwart vandalism and sabotage. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC rule would have given competitive access providers their own space in 
this central office area to install and maintain the equipment that hooked 
their independent phone networks into the main local telephone loop. 
</P>
<P>
 Local phone calls travel to a central office exchange, where they are routed 
through switches and multiplexers that deliver the calls to long-distance 
networks or other local telephone exchanges. 
</P>
<P>
 Companies such as New York-based Teleport Communications Group and MFS 
Communications in Omaha have invested hundreds of millions of dollars stringing 
high-capacity fiber-optic cable and sophisticated switches in urban areas in 
hopes of siphoning customers -- particularly business phone users -- from the 
Baby Bells. 
</P>
<P>
 In Nasdaq trading Friday, shares of Omaha-based MFS Communications Co. 
plummeted $3.75 to close at $24.875. Intermedia Communications of Florida fell 
75 cents to close at $13.25. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're disappointed with the ruling," said James Crowe, chief executive of MFS 
Communications. "It's going to cause confusion in the financial markets."
