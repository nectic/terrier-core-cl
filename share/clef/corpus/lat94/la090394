CITY MAPS BETTER CAB SERVICE FOR NEGLECTED AREAS; TRANSIT: NEW FRANCHISES MAY 
BE OFFERED IN UNDERSERVED NEIGHBORHOODS SUCH AS THE EASTSIDE AND SOUTH LOS 
ANGELES. OFFICIALS HOPE TO LURE BANDIT DRIVERS INTO LEGITIMACY. 
</P>

<P>
 Concerned that huge stretches of Los Angeles do not receive adequate taxi 
service, city transportation officials are pushing a plan to expand the number 
of cabs in underserved areas such as South Los Angeles and the Eastside. 
</P>
<P>
 In seeking bids for such areas, officials are looking at the very drivers they 
have been arresting for years -- the bandit cabbies who operate without city 
licenses but fill in gaps in service. 
</P>
<P>
 The bandits cruise city streets picking up fares in cars that closely resemble 
their legal counterparts. Detractors say they often operate without insurance, 
charge customers exorbitant rates and use cars and drivers that would not meet 
city standards. 
</P>
<P>
 It will probably not be the bandits alone competing for the new city 
franchises. Companies currently licensed to serve large zones such as the 
Westside and the San Fernando Valley can seek to expand into the underserved 
areas, as can companies licensed in other cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilman Nate Holden, who chairs the City Council's Transportation 
Committee, said opening the market to more drivers will have two benefits: "It 
will make the existing companies do a better job in underserved areas and it 
will bring new companies into the system." 
</P>
<P>
 For years, residents in some areas of the city have complained that cabs 
ignore their neighborhoods in favor of more lucrative sites such as Downtown 
hotels and Los Angeles International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 A study conducted by the city found that the nine licensed taxi operators do a 
good job overall in serving the city's 469 square miles but fall far short in 
some residential areas -- mostly in the inner city -- where there are longer 
response times and more "no-shows." About 90% of cab rides in the city are 
requested by phone, and city standards hold that a taxi ought to pull up within 
15 minutes of the call. 
</P>
<P>
 Some cab companies dispute the city's findings, and others argue that it is 
violence against cabbies that makes them wary of some neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 For drivers' safety, the city has required protective shields between the 
front and back seats of cabs. Officials say all of the city's more than 1,400 
taxis have installed the shields. 
</P>
<P>
 Although the underserved areas have never been officially defined, city 
officials say they include out-of-the-way enclaves such as the Hollywood Hills 
as well as neighborhoods in South Los Angeles and the Eastside that drivers 
sometimes deem too dangerous. The precise areas in need of more cabs will be 
determined later, after officials review the bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlicensed drivers have moved to fill the void, cutting into the business of 
legal cabdrivers and frustrating city regulators. 
</P>
<P>
 With so many cab rides coming from telephone orders, officials say, the 
bandits sometimes monitor the radio calls of rivals and attempt to beat them to 
the customers. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year alone, the city arrested 425 bandit drivers for operating without 
city permits -- a misdemeanor that carries a maximum sentence of six months in 
jail and a $1,000 fine -- and impounded 179 of their cars. 
</P>
<P>
 The companies that have paid more than $800 for city franchises complain 
bitterly about the bandits. In 1991, 200 licensed cabbies drove around City 
Hall honking their horns to protest the proliferation of unlicensed cabdrivers. 
</P>
<P>
 If the bid proposal is approved by the City Council later this month, bandit 
drivers -- once described by former Mayor Tom Bradley as a "menace to the city" 
-- will be given a chance to compete for the city licenses. Many unlicensed 
cabdrivers already work in loose networks and they could bid as a group for a 
piece of the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of allowing the bandit drivers into the system raises concerns 
among some licensed companies. 
</P>
<P>
 Shervin Mahmoudian, general manager of Beverly Hills Cab Co., doubts that 
bandits will comply with city rules once they are licensed. "I do believe that 
we have some areas that are being underserved, especially in the south and 
east," he said. "But legalizing the bandits is not the answer. Once they are 
legalized, they will probably head for where the money is." 
</P>
<P>
 Others are optimistic that finally bringing illegal taxi operators under city 
regulation will improve service. 
</P>
<P>
 "Creating opportunities for bandit operators to become qualified, licensed 
operators would raise the quality and safety of the service they provide 
through regulation . . . and would stimulate existing operators to provide 
better service to retain their market shares," senior transportation engineer 
Alan E. Willis said in a report.

CITYSCAPES / MATHIS CHAZANOV: A SCRAMBLE TO PREPARE FOR EARLY HIGH HOLY DAYS; 
'IT'S A LOT OF PRESSURE. AND IT DOESN'T FEEL LIKE ROSH HASHANAH WHEN IT'S 95 
DEGREES OUTSIDE. . . . IT FEELS STRANGE.'

<P>
 Rosh Hashanah, the Jewish New Year, comes early this year. Very early. Earlier 
than it has for 18 years. So early, in fact, that it catches congregants 
winding up their summer vacations. 
</P>
<P>
 And now the rush is on. 
</P>
<P>
 The rush to shop for a nice new outfit. The rush to lay in a supply of gefilte 
fish, turkey, brisket and honey cake. 
</P>
<P>
 The rush to get tickets for the synagogue services that always bring in the 
biggest crowds of the year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Lots of people find themselves not having looked at the calendar, and 
suddenly wake up with shock, saying, 'Oh my God, do I have my tickets? Do I 
have a place to go and where do I go if I don't?' " said Rabbi Harvey J. Fields 
of Wilshire Boulevard Temple. 
</P>
<P>
 His temple's office, like many others, will be staffed Sunday and Monday, 
despite the Labor Day holiday, to help those who were not quite paying 
attention and expected the High Holy Days to start sometime in mid-September or 
later. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The timing for Rosh Hashana is governed by the Jewish calendar, which follows 
the sun as well as the moon and stays on course with the injection of seven 
leap months over a 19-year cycle. Sometimes Rosh Hashanah comes as late as 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 But this year, the solemn, reflective period known as the Days of Awe opens on 
the eve of the New Year on Monday night, as the last barbecue fumes of Labor 
Day waft away with the evening breeze. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's getting kids ready for school, buying clothes and books, and to have 
the holidays at the same time, it's a lot of pressure," said Shimon Kraft, who 
owns a book and Judaica shop in the Pico-Robertson district. "And also it 
doesn't feel like Rosh Hashanah when it's 95 degrees outside. . . . it feels 
strange." 
</P>
<P>
 "If it gets any earlier, I don't what I'm going to do," said Elizabeth Kraft, 
his wife. 
</P>
<P>
 Not to worry. The holidays will not fall this early again until 2013.  
</P>
<P>
 But for now, the aisles of kosher emporiums such as Elat Market on Pico 
Boulevard were as jammed with shoppers Thursday and Friday as the display cases 
were piled high with carp, whitefish, chicken and beef cuts. Another mob scene 
was expected Sunday and Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's always like this before the Sabbath but with Rosh Hashanah it's even 
worse," Ingrid Paredes, a store employee, said as she looked down on the bedlam 
from an upstairs office. 
</P>
<P>
 "We ourselves would rather not walk downstairs because we'd get stuck," she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A shopper, Rahamim Cohen, a retired oil industry executive from Iran, 
explained that in addition to main courses, tradition requires the blessing of 
10 symbolic foods, especially honey and apples "so all the year should be 
sweet." 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes days to get ready, but it's fun," said Anna Geller, a homemaker from 
the former Soviet Union. "I came to this country 20 years ago and I learned 
about the holidays and I love it." 
</P>
<P>
 But with the early onset of the New Year, feelings are decidedly mixed in 
synagogue offices. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's every rabbi's and executive director's nightmare," said Sonia 
Silverblatt, executive director of Temple Beth Am near Beverly Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 With 2,500 people already signed up, she said, as many as 100 more will come 
out of the woodwork during the final days of the old year, which is said to be 
the 5,754th since Creation. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 According to Jewish belief, Rosh Hashanah is the beginning of a 10-day period 
when the fate of every soul for the next year is decided. Repentance, prayer 
and charity are said to avert a harsh decree, so it should come as no surprise 
that the synagogues are full. 
</P>
<P>
 Latecomers for tickets include people who are only seen at services once a 
year, members behind on their dues, regular worshipers who decide it's time to 
join the congregation, and families with last-minute guests from out of town. 
</P>
<P>
 Although High Holy Day tickets at Los Angeles synagogues can cost $100 to 
$200, with full membership going for up to $1,000, rabbis and administrators 
say that no one will be turned away for lack of money. 
</P>
<P>
 There is generally room for the latecomers because there are often members who 
do not get around to telling the office they would be out of town for the 
holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a few exceptions, no one gets in without a ticket. 
</P>
<P>
 This might seem strange. After all, nobody would think of charging for 
attendance at regular weekly services. Indeed, the Christian way of passing the 
collection plate would be unthinkable on the Sabbath, when observant Jews will 
not even touch money. 
</P>
<P>
 A few smaller congregations announce an open-door policy, following up with 
fund-raising appeals once the holidays are over. But with no weekly collection, 
most synagogues have come to depend on the High Holy Days income as one of a 
number of fund-raising tools, along with dinner dances, benefit concerts and 
hard-sell solicitation of wealthy members. 
</P>
<P>
 They could not have picked a better time of the year to charge admission. 
</P>
<P>
 "These are very serious days, days when we're being judged, when our fate is 
being sealed, and there is a religious euphoria or stirring," said Rabbi 
Yisroel Kelemer of Congregation Mogen David near Cheviot Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 "Synagogues have used this opportunity as a form of sustenance," Kelemer said. 
"Giving to the synagogue definitely is charity, and charity is one of the three 
elements that erases a stern decree from God." 
</P>
<P>
 According to David Ellenson, a history professor at Hebrew Union College's Los 
Angeles campus, tickets are a 20th-Century American phenomenon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's only in a country with a separation of church and state that this 
occurs," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Eastern Europe, where the forebears of most American Jews came from, 
synagogues were supported by wealthy patrons or by the government, he noted, as 
is the case in Israel today. 
</P>
<P>
 Then there's security. What with the recent attacks on Jewish and Israeli 
targets in England, Panama and Argentina, not to mention the low-level anxiety 
of everyday life in the big city, tickets help control who is walking through 
the door. 
</P>
<P>
 Dues and ticket sales also help support synagogue schools, said Rabbi Morton 
A. Wallack of Adat Shalom Synagogue in Palms.  
</P>
<P>
 "The Jewish community has an obligation to maintain Jewish education. No 
Jewish child is turned away from a Jewish education," he said. "Well, somebody 
has to pay the bill." 
</P>
<P>
 Then he told a joke. A man shows up at the synagogue on Rosh Hashanah without 
a ticket. He tells the usher that he belongs to the other congregation around 
the corner and he only wants to say hello to his grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "Well, OK," comes the response. "But you better not let me catch you praying!"

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: VAN NUYS; BOY, 12, HELD 
ON ATTEMPTED MURDER CHARGES IN SHOOTING 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A 12-year-old boy who accidentally shot his 14-year-old friend in the head was 
arrested on suspicion of attempted murder Friday, authorities said. His friend 
was hospitalized in critical condition. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger boy found the gun in Delano Park about a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, 14-year-old Victor Tamayo of Pacoima, remained in critical 
condition at Northridge Hospital Medical Center late Friday with a single 
gunshot wound to the head, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives believe the shooting occurred while the two were playing with the 
revolver, but police said they arrested the youngster partly because he had 
lied about his involvement earlier, Detective John Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no reason to believe that this was anything other than an accident, 
but we are continuing to investigate," Edwards said. The shooting occurred 
Thursday about midnight when Victor and a 12-year-old were playing with a 
loaded .38-caliber Colt revolver, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys had looked into the cylinder of the gun and mistakenly believed all 
the chambers were empty, Edwards said. Actually, four of the chambers contained 
bullets.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: LOS ANGELES; COUNCIL 
ACTS TO END 5 DWP MANAGERS' OVERTIME PAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Los Angeles City Council took steps Friday that could end overtime 
payments to five of the Department of Water and Power's highest-paid managers. 
</P>
<P>
 A proposed ordinance would give legal authority to a DWP board resolution 
approved in April to disqualify the managers from such pay. 
</P>
<P>
 In March, a report revealed that 468 managers who earn more than $70,000 a 
year each received an average of $4,600 in overtime payments in 1992. In 
contrast, employees who work in other city departments and have annual salaries 
of $55,000 apiece averaged about $745 in overtime compensation. 
</P>
<P>
 The DWP board voted to discontinue the overtime pay for two assistant general 
managers, the chief financial officer and two executive assistants to the 
general manager. They earn $114,000 to $150,000 a year.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: WEST COVINA; 
ASSEMBLYMAN'S CAMPAIGN HEADQUARTERS VANDALIZED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The campaign headquarters of Assemblyman Paul V. Horcher (R-Diamond Bar), who 
is running for the state Senate, was vandalized this week, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Someone apparently used pliers to open the back door of the office in West 
Covina between 11:30 p.m. Wednesday and 9 a.m. Thursday, said West Covina 
Police Cmdr.Jim Dillon. 
</P>
<P>
 The vandals dumped a computer off a desk and tore some artwork that was to be 
used for a campaign mailer, police and Horcher aides said. Nothing was stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 A Horcher spokesman said the computer still worked and that he had another 
copy of the artwork so the campaign would not be affected. 
</P>
<P>
 Horcher is one of seven candidates running in a Sept. 13 special election for 
the Senate's 29th District seat. The district was represented by former Sen. 
Frank Hill, who resigned July 8 after a federal jury found him guilty of 
extortion, money laundering and conspiracy.

GATE-CRASHERS PUT CHRISTIAN MUSIC FESTIVAL IN RED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOHN DART, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month's Christian music festival in Burbank ended $236,000 in debt 
because of what an organizer Friday called a "shocking and alarming" number of 
people cheating to get in free. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't expect that (at a Christian event), but it happened," complained 
Carey Wong of Glendale, one of the festival's two novice organizers. "It's very 
heartbreaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said that although Summer Praise '94, held Aug. 11-14, won favorable 
comments from participants, the paid attendance totaled only 4,000 to 5,000 -- 
well below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 People who paid were given plastic wristbands, which they could show to be 
readmitted if they left the festival or came back on another day, and were 
asked not to remove them, he said. But many people with cut or taped-together 
wristbands appeared at gates and gave various excuses as to why the bands were 
not intact, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials admitted many people with what were apparently unpaid wristbands 
rather than question their truthfulness, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, "some gates were unguarded or security was not checking people 
carefully," said Paul Hammack, one of the festival's promotion officials. 
Organizers also reported that food tickets and cases of meat were apparently 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 By late this week, Wong and his partner, George Jerome, a Chatsworth 
businessman, had reduced the outstanding debt to $175,000. Some musical artists 
have volunteered to appear again in fund-raising events to help pay off more, 
said Hammack. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said that as many as 8,500 people attended the final evening's events, 
featuring popular Christian vocalist Carman. 
</P>
<P>
 Preacher Carlton Pearson of Tulsa, Okla., urged the crowd on the final night 
to pay the full admission price if they had not gotten in honestly. "Instead of 
accepting an honorarium for his appearance, Pearson wrote a $500 check to 
offset debts," Hammack said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-degree heat also apparently kept people away, Hammack said, noting 
that 942 pre-purchased tickets went unclaimed.

 Too bad Court TV wasn't around then: Attorney Robert Shapiro's indiscretion in

 During the 1850s "it was normal procedure to throw inkstands in the 
courtroom," wrote W. W. Robinson in "Lawyers of Los Angeles." On one occasion 
when the lawyers moved beyond inkstands and took up "canes, chairs and finally 
pistols," Robinson reported that Judge William Dryden crouched behind his bench 
and yelled:

in case you want to put more money in the meter."

 The Loch Angeles monster (cont.): We recently reported that Silver Lake-area 
flyers have accused the government of covering up the presence of a "strange 
prehistoric creature" in the Ivanhoe Reservoir. 
</P>
<P>
 We weren't concerned until we heard from Ralph Shaffer, a history professor 
emeritus at Cal Poly Pomona, who pointed out that this is not the first such 
report in L.A. County.  
</P>
<P>
 Shaffer enclosed an Aug. 1, 1886, article from the L.A. Times that was 
headlined: "A Holy Terror. The Fiery Dragon of Elizabeth Lake." 
</P>

 The article recounted how a traveler named Peter B. Simpson said that west of 
Lancaster he encountered a creature "about 30 feet long . . . of a warm reddish 
color with a long snout and jagged yellow teeth . . . enormous wings, ribbed 
like those of a bat evidently, long hind legs and a long tail." 
</P>
<P>
 Simpson said he fired his rifle at the beast, which then flew off, plopping 
down into Lake Elizabeth.

 "Perhaps," Shaffer says ominously, "it migrated to the Ivanhoe Reservoir."

 Sunday is the birthday of the City of Angels (don't tell us you forgot!). Say 
what you want about L.A., but for a city turning 213 years old it shows no sign 
of slowing down.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SANTA MONICA; 
ENVIRONMENTAL GROUPS SUE COUNTY OVER BAY POLLUTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Los Angeles County officials are not doing enough to clean up urban water 
runoff polluting the Santa Monica Bay, according to a lawsuit filed by two 
environmental groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The Natural Resources Defense Council and Santa Monica BayKeeper are accusing 
the Department of Public Works of 11 violations of the Clean Water Act, 
attorney Everett DeLano said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 All the violations have to do with the monitoring and control of storm water 
runoff that enters the bay. 
</P>
<P>
 "They bought very expensive monitoring equipment, (but) it's sitting in a 
warehouse gathering dust," DeLano said. "They basically have not taken the 
leadership position that they should be taking and that they're required to 
take under the law." 
</P>
<P>
 Public Works spokeswoman Donna Guyovich said department heads had not reviewed 
the lawsuit, but she expected them to evaluate it next week. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the complaint, excessive amounts of runoff water entering the bay 
contain harmful pollutants, including lead, mercury and several cancer-causing 
chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Storm water flows over impervious surfaces such as roads, parking lots, 
industrial facilities, construction sites, and other areas which the county 
controls . . . generally without treatment," the lawsuit said.

MOUNTED POLICE, ARMED GUARDS OKD FOR 'GHOST TOWN'; QUAKE: STEPPED-UP SECURITY 
AT DAMAGED APARTMENT BUILDINGS IN NORTH HILLS COULD BEGIN THIS WEEKEND. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Acknowledging that traditional crime-fighting methods have failed to protect a 
San Fernando Valley "ghost town" -- a cluster of apartment buildings left 
uninhabitable by quake damage -- city officials announced Friday that they will 
deploy police on horseback at the site and replace some unarmed private guards 
with those who carry guns. 
</P>
<P>
 The stepped-up security measures at the North Hills ghost town east of the San 
Diego Freeway could go into effect this weekend, just a week after neighbors 
complained that unarmed guards hired by the city are useless because they 
cannot stand up to potentially dangerous drug dealers, gang members and other 
interlopers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no idea they would move this quickly. We're just tickled to death," 
said Harry Coleman, chairman of the North Hills Task Force, a citizens group. 
"For the first time since the quake, I'm optimistic that teamwork is really 
working." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan proposed by Los Angeles Councilman Richard Alarcon, 10 private 
guards will be assigned to patrol the ghost town, four more than before. Two 
guards will be armed and will patrol the area in a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounted police officers will begin patrolling the ghost town as soon as 
officials can relieve them of other duties, said Los Angeles Police Cmdr. Scott 
LaChasse. 
</P>
<P>
 "With mounted officers, you've got the visibility factor you need," he said. 
"Not only are they more visible to the public, the officers themselves can see 
more" because they have a higher vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
 The private guards are being bolstered by guards with guns as "a protective 
thing for them," LaChasse said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the Northridge quake created at least 13 clusters of uninhabited 
apartment buildings in the Valley, Hollywood and Mid-City area, some neighbors 
have complained about problems they cause, ranging from squatters barbecuing 
inside abandoned units to prostitutes and drug dealers setting up shop in the 
parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 But the extra security measures announced Friday are necessary only at the 
North Hills site, largely because of pre-existing crime problems there, police 
said. In an effort to reduce drive-by drug trafficking in the same area, police 
barricaded some streets east of the freeway between Roscoe Boulevard and 
Nordhoff Street several years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 The city is paying for the guards by tapping a $4-million federal disaster 
relief fund it received to board up, fence off and protect the ghost towns. The 
armed guards will cost about $18 an hour, only $3 more an hour than unarmed 
guards, said Pat Bonino, supervisor of disaster recovery for the city 
administrative office.

POLICE ARREST SUSPECT IN SEXUAL ASSAULTS BY PHONY INS OFFICIAL; CRIME: A SAN 
GABRIEL MAN IS TAKEN INTO CUSTODY AFTER A TIP TO EL MONTE AUTHORITIES. THE 
FORMER WAITER IS ACCUSED OF ATTACKING AT LEAST 24 WOMEN WHILE PASSING HIMSELF 
OFF AS AN IMMIGRATION AGENT TO PRIMARILY SPANISH-SPEAKING VICTIMS.

<P>
 A 22-year-old San Gabriel man suspected of posing as an immigration officer 
and then sexually assaulting at least 24 women was being held Friday at El 
Monte City Jail in lieu of $5 million bail, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Christopher Aguayo was arrested Thursday evening after police received a tip 
from an informant, and six victims identified him as the man who assaulted 
them, El Monte Police Detective John Fentress said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police would not reveal the identity of the informant but said the woman might 
be eligible for a $10,000 reward offered by the city of El Monte and the county 
Board of Supervisors. 
</P>
<P>
 Between November, 1993, and Aug. 10 of this year, 21 women in El Monte and 
three in the Temple City area reported being sexually assaulted by a man who 
claimed to be an immigration officer. 
</P>
<P>
 Once he gained entrance to his victims' apartments, the suspect told the women 
that he needed to search them for weapons and then sexually assaulted them, 
police said. He often told his victims that if they did not cooperate, their 
families would be deported, police said. Police added that he targeted 
Spanish-speaking women. 
</P>
<P>
 Aguayo, who is from Utah, worked as a waiter at the Olive Garden in Arcadia 
until two weeks ago, when restaurant officials said he was fired after they 
received customer complaints about his service. Police are unsure whether 
Aguayo is employed now. He will be arraigned at Rio Hondo Municipal Court on 
Tuesday morning.

COUNCIL SEEKS NEW DELAY IN SUBWAY TUNNELS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARC LACEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Concerned about the sinking of a stretch of Hollywood Boulevard, the City 
Council asked transit officials Friday to delay further subway tunneling until 
the city conducts independent engineering tests of the underground 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 The request could add a two-week delay to the $1.5-billion transit project, 
which is to connect Downtown with the San Fernando Valley. If the Metropolitan 
Transportation Authority does not comply, the council authorized City Atty. 
James Hahn to seek a court order that would halt work on the subway. 
</P>
<P>
 Edward McSpedon, the MTA's chief executive officer for construction, told the 
council that the additional tests were not necessary. After the council vote, 
MTA officials declined to comment until they reviewed the council's action and 
consulted with their legal counsel. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, officials found that several blocks of the boulevard had sunk, in 
some places up to nine inches. The discovery forced the closure of several 
blocks of the famed thoroughfare, the evacuation of dozens of residents and the 
rescue of sidewalk stars along Hollywood's Walk of Fame. 
</P>
<P>
 "The public and my office have lost confidence that we can be assured that 
this won't happen again," Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, a panel of experts convened by the MTA concluded that the twin 
subway tunnels beneath Hollywood Boulevard are in no danger of collapse and 
that tunneling -- which was suspended Aug. 20 at the behest of Hollywood 
residents and merchants -- could resume by mid-September. 
</P>
<P>
 The panel of tunnel and soil experts said the sinkage was caused by loosely 
packed soil that had been drenched by leaking water lines. The panel also 
blamed soils compacted by construction work and the failure of wooden wedges in 
the tunnels to hold up under pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 The review board said that tunneling could proceed with only minor sinking if 
engineers take a few remedial measures. 
</P>
<P>
 But Goldberg wants city engineers, city building and safety experts and an 
independent contractor hired by the city to review the MTA study and conduct 
its own investigation. City officials discussed the measures in closed session 
because of fears that the MTA might sue the city. 
</P>
<P>
 The Federal Transit Authority is conducting an investigation of its own and 
Goldberg said the city study may not be necessary if city officials are assured 
that federal authorities will conduct a comprehensive look at the sinkage.

JOURNEY OF TORAH FOUND IN DRAWER BESPEAKS TIES OF FAMILY AND FAITH; ROSH 
HASHANAH: WRITTEN A CENTURY AGO, HAND-LETTERED PARCHMENT SCROLL ACCOMPANIED 
EMIGRES AS THEY FLED OPPRESSION IN A BELARUSSIAN HAMLET AND EVENTUALLY SETTLED 
IN IOWA.

<P>
 The puzzlement in my brother's voice caught me up short. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim, can you come in here a minute? I want to show you something." 
</P>
<P>
 Kalman and I had just arrived in Sioux City, Iowa, to prepare for the death of 
our mother, Merry Gralnek Klass, after an eight-month series of strokes. In the 
bedroom where my brother was staying, he had found a small Torah in a built-in 
drawer. 
</P>
<P>
 Documents showed that the painstakingly hand-lettered parchment scroll was 
brought to Marshalltown, Iowa, in 1909 by our grandmother, Tuva Kastelman 
Gralnek, who died when Mom was a girl. 
</P>
<P>
 After years in storage, the little Torah is now one of three at Temple B'nai 
Torah, the Mercer Island synagogue Kal and I attend. While the parchment of 
most Torahs is about 28 inches high, ours is about half that size. 
</P>
<P>
 For me, the most moving times it is read are at Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur, 
the 10-day period of the High Holy Days, which begin at sundown Monday. The 
Torah is read at children's services. That's when I tell the youngsters, 
including my daughters, Dustin Rose, 8, and Tatanya Renee, 7, how it came to 
us. 
</P>
<P>
 A Torah, the first five books of the Bible inscribed in a special Hebrew 
script, is the most holy object in Judaism. 
</P>
<P>
 Torahs as small as ours are uncommon, and rarely can any Torah be traced back 
a century within one family. The late Rabbi Jacob Singer, founder of Temple 
B'nai Torah, owned a Torah of similar size that had been used in Warsaw to 
prepare boys for bar mitzvah, the ceremony of achieving full status within the 
Jewish community at age 13. 
</P>
<P>
 The Holocaust Museum in Washington, D.C., contains a display of Torah 
fragments from areas overrun by the Nazis. If not for my grandmother, for whom 
I am named, ours might have met a similar fate. 
</P>
<P>
 It was written around 100 years ago, possibly by a cousin of our grandfather, 
Kolman Gralnek, in or near a southwestern Belarussian hamlet called Mikolaiv 
where the family supported a synagogue. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing conscription into the notoriously anti-Semitic Russian Army, Kolman 
Gralnek and his older brother, Moishe, left their wives and children one night 
in 1904 and made their way to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Five years later, they had earned enough by carrying bags of coal and other 
backbreaking labor in New York to send for their families. 
</P>
<P>
 With help from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, they resettled as pack 
peddlers in central Iowa, Moishe in Newton and Kolman in Marshalltown. 
</P>
<P>
 My grandmother insisted on bringing the little Torah so her children would 
have at least one source of Jewish instruction. 
</P>
<P>
 She, her sister-in-law and their children arrived at Ellis Island on the 
Fourth of July in 1909. 
</P>
<P>
 My mother, the youngest of nine, was born in 1917. The Torah remained in the 
household until 1939, when Sons of Israel Congregation was organized. 
</P>
<P>
 Born in 1948 in Sioux City, I attended services a few times in Marshalltown 
and must have seen the little Torah. Never was I told it was part of our family 
heritage. 
</P>
<P>
 When Sons of Israel was disbanded in 1985, two larger Torahs were sent to 
other synagogues. 
</P>
<P>
 The same would have happened to ours, but my aunts Esther and Tillie Gralnek 
retrieved the small scroll with its original vestments at the last minute and 
took it to Mom for safekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 She never told any of us. By the time of my brother's discovery in 1989, she 
was no longer able to speak. Days later, she was dead. 
</P>
<P>
 Sioux City's Jewish community is following the same pattern of inexorable 
evaporation as in Marshalltown and most of the rest of the nation's heartland. 
</P>
<P>
 Kal and I live in Seattle. One sister lives on Mercer Island but attends a 
different synagogue. The second is in Santa Cruz, Calif. The third, Kal's twin, 
is in Bethesda, Md. 
</P>
<P>
 We once had a dozen aunts, uncles and cousins in Sioux City and nearly 20 
others elsewhere in Iowa. All that remain among our family are our father in 
Sioux City, two aunts in Marshalltown and a cousin in Des Moines. 
</P>
<P>
 After Mom's funeral, our aunts decided ownership of the Torah would pass to my 
brother, who is named for our grandfather. 
</P>
<P>
 It is used regularly at Temple B'nai Torah, and we take it to read at each 
family bar or bat mitzvah. 
</P>
<P>
 All five of us have read from it. 
</P>
<P>
 At our synagogue, Rabbi James L. Mirel enjoys being able to extend 
participation to those without the physical strength to lift a full-size Torah.

TAKING COMMAND; GEN. PAUL A. RADER PLANS TO PREPARE THE SALVATION ARMY FOR THE 
NEXT CENTURY WITH AN EYE ON TRADITION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Mention the Salvation Army and many people think of bell ringers at 
Christmastime or uniformed musicians on street corners playing brass 
instruments and waving tambourines. 
</P>
<P>
 But for Gen. Paul A. Rader, the first native-born American to command the 
Salvation Army worldwide, that image, although accurate, is too narrow. 
</P>
<P>
 Best known for its social programs and disaster relief efforts, the Salvation 
Army says that it is at heart an evangelical Christian church. It is biblically 
conservative but socially active. 
</P>
<P>
 Elected general July 23, Rader said he is keenly aware that during his 
five-year term the 129-year-old Salvation Army will be preparing to enter the 
next millennium. 
</P>
<P>
 Until his election as general, Rader was the organization's territorial 
commander for the western United States with headquarters at Rancho Palos 
Verdes. He moved to his new headquarters in London this week. 
</P>
<P>
 In a wide-ranging interview with Times religion writer Larry B. Stammer, Rader 
reflected on his faith, the challenges facing the 3 million officers, soldiers 
and members of the Salvation Army, and his penchant for activism over 
reflections on doctrine. Following are excerpts: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: For most people, an encounter with the Salvation Army is with bell 
ringers on street corners. Are you bothered by the way the army is popularly 
perceived? 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: My No. 1 priority is to clarify our identity . . . to be seen as an 
evangelical part of the universal church of Christ. (But) the Salvation Army is 
one of the most popular charities, thank God, in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why the popularity? 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: I think because there have been a lot of people over the years who have 
worn this uniform well. They have acted with great compassion. They've been 
there for people in a thousand different situations: In Anaheim working with 
gangs. New York prostitutes. Hollywood runaways. Earthquake and flood relief in 
California and the Midwest. Hurricane relief in Florida. . . . You do that for 
100 years and (you) build up in the public a sense that the army can be 
trusted, that they're going to be there. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: You spent 17 years in Korea with the army. Did that experience change you? 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: Profoundly. . . . The intensity of dedication of Korean Christians is a 
very impressive kind of thing; their commitment to a life of prayer, their 
dissatisfaction with any kind of religious experience that doesn't produce 
results in their lives and in their communities. . . . Korean Christians always 
think in terms of what the Gospel means for the whole of their country. They're 
not thinking so . . . individually. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Are most churches looking inward? 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: I perhaps should only comment that we certainly see the necessity of 
working toward . . . the church being turned inside-out. . . . The tendency 
always is to move from the outside in, to be self-concerned and keep your 
fingers on your spiritual pulse and look after your own personal well being and 
ignore the fact that the world is going to hell in a handbasket. Our concern 
has been with what's happening on the street. . . . You're not commissioned to 
serve just a small congregation in the corner of some community. You're 
commissioned to that community. Everybody on the street, everybody in the 
hospital, everybody in the prison is part of your parish. You're responsible to 
reach people and to serve them in love and compassion in the name and spirit of 
Christ. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about the army's uniforms? 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: I don't think I'm going to make a decision to do away with uniforms, I 
can tell you that. But I think we have to give thought to how we wear it and 
where we wear it and why we wear it. . . . What the uniform says is, "I'm 
available." That puts you in the path of a lot of pain in the world. . . . We 
have thousands of people -- hundreds of thousands of people -- who are willing 
to wear this uniform. To say that to the world, I think, is quite a remarkable 
thing in these times. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Is your uniform a reminder that you're in "spiritual warfare," that you're 
taking on "principalities and powers?" 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: It certainly intends to communicate that and to be a reminder to the 
whole church. I see us as a part of the whole evangelical church. We each bear 
our witness denominationally. I think those who are strongly Sacramentarian in 
tradition have an important witness to bear that enriches us all. Others who 
are more revivalistic or Pentecostal, I think, have a powerful testimony to 
bear. . . . But I think the army speaks of the militancy of the church. . . . 
What I'm concerned about is, are we really engaging evil in the world? Are we 
really involved in the fight here?  
</P>
<P>
 Q: How do you define evil? 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: I believe in a personal devil. I believe in an evil, intelligent person 
in the universe that is operational and is a cause for a great deal of the 
suffering, anguish and pain of the world. . . . We deal both with our capacity 
for greatness and the kind of glory that God intended for us and . . . our own 
sinfulness . . . that has created a great deal of the suffering in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you see the fall from innocence recorded in the Genesis account of Adam 
and Eve as literal historical truth, or myth that conveys a transcendent truth? 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: I see it as literal truth myself. I have no problem with that at all. . 
. . Something occurred there, whatever form it took. There was something there 
and there was a transaction taken there that has had a dire effect on human 
history ever since. The result has been this sadness and evil and death and 
suffering that we see all about us in the world. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Those outside the army rarely hear of internal controversies over doctrinal 
issues or Bible interpretation.  
</P>
<P>
 Rader: We have a very clear doctrinal statement. . . . Our message is based on 
the Bible. . . . We're very activist in what we do. But to support that 
adequately with an understanding of why we do it from a biblical and 
theological point of view is important. . . . There is more conservatism 
theologically now than at some points in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why? 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: I think some parts of the army (were) enamored with liberal 
perspectives and it sort of filtered down, particularly in certain groupings. 
But what keeps bringing us back toward center is we're very focused on task, 
mission and evangelism. You can't sustain that very long, in my view, with a 
liberal theological perspective. I think you're going to drift away from it. 
You're going to lose your evangelistic zeal. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What is your view of AIDS and homosexuality? 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: We're not into judging people on the basis of how they got into that 
kind of a situation (AIDS). There are a variety of reasons. . . . But we all 
know that a great majority of those . . . are infected because of homosexual 
activity. That's just a statistical reality. . . . We don't believe it's 
morally acceptable as a lifestyle. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 But at the same time, not only with regard to homosexual behavior, but a whole 
range of behaviors, we have reached out in love to people who have done all 
sorts of things -- whether they're murderers or prostitutes or whatever they 
are. . . . We're going to try to help them find a way to a satisfying, 
God-honoring kind of life. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you ever had a "wilderness experience" in your life, a crisis of faith 
or doubt? 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: You know, I'm a true believer. I have to say that I have not struggled 
with doubt. I've had questions over the years, of course. I've spent a lifetime 
encounter with Scripture and tried to sort through those questions and find 
answers. I think maybe I live more comfortably with the uncertainties of faith 
than some people do. . . . We all have a lot that when we get to heaven we want 
to ask God about. . . . My own faith in Christ has been reinforced over the 
years and strengthened by what I've seen of the faithfulness of God in so many 
circumstances, reflected in peoples' lives of great courage and devotion. That 
sustains you in times when you can't understand what it is God is up to. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: There were only two women on the 45-member High Council that elected you. 
Do you see patriarchy as a problem to be addressed or a tradition to be 
affirmed? 
</P>
<P>
 Rader: A problem to be addressed. It was only an accident of history that only 
two women were on the High Council. . . . I hope that doesn't happen again and 
I'll do what I can to prevent it from happening. . . . Traditionally, we have 
kind of led the pack on women in ministry all across the world. Half of our 
women are ordained. Half of our officers are ordained women and they're 
functional. They're preaching. They're ministering.

<P>
 In anticipation of the Jewish New Year 5755, which begins at sundown Monday, 
the Washington-based Israel Policy Forum has mailed a booklet, "For the Sake of 
Peace: A Resource Guide for the High Holidays," to rabbis in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Compiled by Los Angeles rabbinical student Mona Alfi, the 48-page guide is 
accompanied by a letter from Israeli Prime Minister Itzhak Rabin urging the 
4,000 Orthodox, Conservative, Reform and Reconstructionist members of the 
rabbinate to use it in preparing sermons that strongly support his government's 
peace initiative. 
</P>
<P>
 A similar letter from 11 rabbis who participated in the booklet's preparation 
-- including Harvey Fields of Wilshire Boulevard Temple in Los Angeles and 
Arnold Rachlis of University Synagogue in Irvine -- was included. None of the 
letter's signers represents the Orthodox movement, which accounts for about 7% 
of the Jewish population in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Rabbinical sermons reach their largest audiences during the Days of Awe, a 
10-day period of self-reflection, reconciliation and renewal, during which many 
of Los Angeles' nearly 500,000 Jews will go to synagogues to hear the ritual 
blasts of the ram's horn, said Alfi, a second-year rabbinical student at Hebrew 
Union College in Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
 She said she did not know how many rabbis would be using the guide, but said 
that most rabbis customarily devote at least one sermon to Israel during this 
period. The topic will be even more prominent in rabbinate minds this year, 
Alfi said, because the first anniversary of the historic handshake between 
Rabin and PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat and their signing of the Declaration of 
Principles of Peace falls during the holiday period, which culminates after 
sundown on Yom Kippur (Day of Atonement) on Sept. 15. 
</P>
<P>
 Jonathan Jacoby, executive vice president of the policy institute and a Los 
Angeles native, said: "The guide is based on prayer, Torah and other religious 
sources. We've even included the original Hebrew texts, so that rabbis who have 
a problem with the translations can use their own." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to excerpts from the Bible, quotes from sermons and articles 
promoting peace and addresses of Jewish organizations, the guide includes 
opinion polls conducted among Jews in Israel and the United States showing that 
about three-fourths of their populations support the peace process. 
</P>
<P>
 Rachlis, who was placing the finishing touches on his own sermons, noted that 
"although the vast majority of American Jews and Israelis support Rabin and the 
peace process, many American Jewish organizations have remained silent and 
overly cautious, creating a vacuum for anti-peace factions to fill." 
</P>
<P>
 "The purpose of preparing the booklet," he said, "was to help rabbis inspire 
their congregations to not only bask in the pleasure of peace but also to work 
proactively through Jewish organizations, synagogues and charities to make sure 
that the fledgling peace is sustained and built upon." 
</P>
<P>
 He noted that the past year brought not only a peace agreement but also "a 
number of terrorist incidents that can sometimes dishearten even those most 
optimistic about an eventual peace." But, he hastened to add, "Prime Minister 
Rabin and Foreign Minister (Shimon) Peres have both said that . . . we dare not 
let the terrorists win by giving up the peace process in the face of these 
tragedies." 
</P>
<P>
 Alfi, who was a policy analyst for the America Israel Public Affairs Committee 
before deciding on a career change, said: "Many of us who work for peace are 
acting not from humanist beliefs, but directly from our religious tradition, 
which enjoins us to seek peace. Jews may disagree on the particulars," she 
added, "but love for Israel is universal throughout our community." 
</P>
<P>

BUSINESS CLIMATE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * We applaud Peter King's Swiftian aim at political leaders' conviction that 
impending economic doom results when corporations threaten to leave, or do 
leave, California (On California, Aug. 24). 
</P>
<P>
 History shows that California's greatness came on the heels of freewheeling 
entrepreneurs. The energy driving the resurgence of California comes from 
small, streamlined, growing businesses, just as has historically been the case. 
The only significant difference is that many of these are mostly owned by women 
and minorities. 
</P>
<P>
 We are the strength of the emerging new economy. Small businesses account for 
hundreds of thousands of jobs. Combined, we account for more jobs than any 
other single corporation in this region. 
</P>
<P>
 No one wants to lose Taco Bell, or General Motors, or General Dynamics. The 
pain of their loss is indeed felt, especially by their former employees and 
surrounding communities. But we are not going to crumble when large 
corporations make shortsighted decisions to leave our demanding business 
climate. California is the future of this country. All of our problems 
eventually will find their way to Texas. Or Idaho. Or Spokane. None of our 
strength, however, will leave. 
</P>
<P>
 For all businesses, leaving California means leaving one of the most skilled 
and highly educated work forces in the country, a university system that feeds 
the work force and resource support from high-tech companies that rival any 
region. Leaving California also means leaving any connection to overseas 
expansion. No other region in this country has the immigrant strength that we 
have. Many of our immigrant-owned businesses have ties to their overseas 
homelands with ready markets for U.S. goods and services. 
</P>
<P>
 Instead of focusing on an admittedly dysfunctional tax system, responsible 
business leaders should be looking at how to restructure it so it serves us 
better. Instead of focusing on diversity and immigration as a threat, 
responsible business leaders should focus on solving our legitimate immigration 
problems, while taking advantage of the international markets which exist 
within California. Instead of complaining about how bad our educational system 
is, responsible business leaders should ensure that it maintains our 
competitive edge.

KICKOFF CARRIES A SPECIAL MEANING; REBUILT COLISEUM MARKS L.A.'S QUAKE RECOVERY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the USC football team takes the field at the Los Angeles Memorial 
Coliseum this afternoon, it will mark an event far more important than the 
start of football season. It will symbolize to the entire nation how rapidly 
this region bounced back from the Northridge earthquake of Jan. 17. 
</P>
<P>
 This fall USC and the Raiders pro football team will be playing in a 
handsomely rebuilt football stadium. Less than eight months ago, that seemed 
improbable, if not impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Most people who inspected the 71-year-old Coliseum in the aftermath of the 
disaster thought it was doomed. There were more than 10,000 cracks throughout 
the stadium, and whole sections of the superstructure had separated from the 
outer walls. Rebuilding estimates started at $35 million, a daunting amount 
that experts warned was likely to go higher. It did, reaching almost $60 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 But to their great credit, members of the Coliseum Commission were not among 
those who figured nothing could be done except relegate the stadium to the 
status of a damaged landmark, like its namesake in Rome. 
</P>
<P>
 Led by Los Angeles County Supervisor Yvonne Brathwaite Burke and Los Angeles 
Mayor Richard Riordan, local leaders immediately began funneling to the 
Coliseum some of the federal and state disaster aid money that flowed into Los 
Angeles after the quake. They were fortunate, of course, to be pushing for the 
reconstruction of a building officially designated both a national and 
California historic landmark, a structure that had hosted two Olympics as well 
as speeches by presidents, popes and other leaders. 
</P>
<P>
 The Coliseum's historic status allowed the Clinton Administration to fund the 
start of reconstruction quickly, through the Federal Emergency Management 
Agency; 90% of the rebuilding costs were paid by Washington, with the balance 
coming from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 With funding assured, more than 2,000 construction workers and engineers began 
working around the clock, seven days a week. They completed the task with days 
to spare. The result is a stadium that is not just seismically safer, with 
thicker support walls and reinforcing beams throughout, but that also looks 
better than it has in many years. 
</P>
<P>
 To be sure, the freeways that were even more hurriedly rebuilt are more 
important to our economy. So are the many schools, hospitals, libraries and 
other buildings that have come back into use since that awful January morning. 
But for people throughout the rest of the nation who watch Raider or USC games 
on television this fall, no symbol of Los Angeles' recovery will be more 
powerful than the Coliseum filled with Angelenos and others cheering the local 
teams.

WHY MUST THE CHILDREN DIE? 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Time was when the tragedy of a child shot down in cold blood would generate 
such revulsion, such an outpouring of emotion, that entire communities ached 
along with grieving parents. And once the grieving subsided, entire communities 
demanded that something be done. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, our children fall with a frequency that is numbing. Nationally, more than 
a dozen under age 19 die every day in gun-related homicides, accidents or 
suicides. A few examples, from this week alone: 
</P>
<P>
 Sunday, on Chicago's South Side, Shavon Dean, 14, was fatally wounded by a 
bullet that police believe was fired by 11-year-old Robert Sandifer Jr. Robert, 
already a hardened gang member with eight arrests including armed robbery, was 
found murdered Thursday, shot twice in the back of the head. Authorities blame 
members of his gang. 
</P>
<P>
 Monday, closer to home, 16-month-old Maureen Ramirez was shot to death in her 
stroller along a gang-infested street in South El Monte. The toddler's skull 
was pierced by a burst of semiautomatic weapons fire.  
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday, another toddler, 1 1/2, was fatally struck down in Los Angeles. The 
weapon, a handgun accidentally fired by the child's older brother, 5. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, a 14-year-old boy was in critical condition after he was shot in the 
head allegedly by a 12-year-old friend who was playing with the weapon in a Van 
Nuys home. The younger boy reportedly told police he had found the gun in a 
park. 
</P>
<P>
 For each of the past five years, gun dealers in Los Angeles and Orange 
counties together have sold, on average, more than 100,000 firearms. Countless 
others are purchased illegally on the street. 
</P>
<P>
 The gun lobby says that makes for a safer society. So that begs a question: 
Why are so many children dying?

WATER WATCH; DEAL ON THE DELTA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the author Marc Reisner once observed, water in the American West runs 
uphill -- toward money. Nothing quite so defines and controls the economic life 
and destiny of California as the massive man-made plumbing that draws water 
down from the north, lifts it over the Tehachapi Mountains and turns arid 
Southern California into one of the world's great metropolises. 
</P>
<P>
 But this has come at a high price, in more than just dollars. The essential 
heart of the circulation system that feeds Southern California lies 400 miles 
north of Los Angeles, in the Sacramento Delta and estuary, where waters from 
melting mountain snows are diverted into huge aqueducts, the great liquid 
freeways that flow south to farms and cities. 
</P>
<P>
 Years of overpumping, compounded by drought, have brought these ecologically 
sensitive wetlands east of San Francisco to near-collapse. The historic balance 
between fresh and brackish water has been seriously upset, threatening many 
species and damaging water quality. 
</P>
<P>
 We therefore welcome news that California's 11 largest urban water agencies 
have reached agreement with environmentalists on new salinity standards for 
Suisun Bay in the delta. They acted not entirely out of altruism; the threat of 
legal action under the federal and state endangered species acts helped sharpen 
the issue. 
</P>
<P>
 This could mean tighter water supplies in dry years. But Southern California 
has benefited mightily for decades from the delta. It's time to recognize that 
it must be healed, both to protect wildlife and future water supplies.

U.S.-NORTH KOREAN SEMAPHORE; SIGNALS FLY AS WASHINGTON SEEKS TO OPEN DOORS TO A 
LONGTIME ENEMY NATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers cautions against inferring too much 
from the two sets of talks that U.S. and North Korean officials plan to open on 
Sept. 10. Clearly the Clinton Administration wants to avoid encouraging 
excessive expectations. But clearly, too, something is stirring, and the new 
movement is not lacking in political significance. 
</P>
<P>
 That's especially true about the meetings that are scheduled to take place in 
Pyongyang. For the first time, American diplomats will be journeying to North 
Korea's capital, there to talk about such matters as where the United States 
might rent residential and office space and how communications would be set up 
if the two countries exchange liaison missions. Such technical matters, of 
course, are not typically taken up years in advance of the time that missions 
are actually established. That's why their political symbolism surely will be 
plain to the North Koreans. At a minimum, the message Washington wants to send 
is that it's serious about improving relations with a country that has been its 
bitter enemy for nearly half a century. 
</P>
<P>
 De facto diplomatic recognition is one of the carrots the United States has 
offered if North Korea agrees to open its nuclear program to full international 
inspection and safeguards. U.S. help in upgrading North Korea's 
electricity-generating nuclear power plants is another carrot, and that will 
the topic of the second set of talks starting Sept. 10, in Berlin. What the 
United States, South Korea, the United Nations and the International Atomic 
Energy Agency want from North Korea in return is an end to its efforts to build 
nuclear weapons and on-site inspections to determine whether diversion of 
nuclear material for weapons has already taken place. 
</P>
<P>
 So far Pyongyang has said only that it would freeze its nuclear program. It 
has yet to allow inspection of two sites that could reveal whether it has 
already developed a nuclear device. That's on the agenda for still another set 
of talks later this month. Meanwhile, Washington is signaling a more flexible 
diplomatic line to the new North Korean leadership. That wig-wagging is 
welcome. How productive it might prove to be is now pretty much up to 
Pyongyang.

MEXICAN ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * I was in Mexico when I heard of the validation and declaration of a "clean 
and fair process" by the United States. This announcement was made the day 
before the organization of national observers, Allianza Civica, and their 
invited international visitors released their findings. 
</P>
<P>
 Many international observers saw and heard of pressures to withhold benefits 
from government programs impacting rural areas, union pressure and requirements 
to vote for the government party, landowners present at voting precincts, 
nullification of primarily opposition votes for marks outside the square box, 
lost results for a variety of reasons (approximately 11,000 precincts according 
to El Financiero, Aug. 25), an unknown number of people with the new photo 
credentials unable to vote because they were not on the voting list (but were 
on some of the party lists), credential confiscation in March and April in 
marginal and rural communities, 17 tons of shredded credential materials 
located after the elections, off-site computer locations found that had ballots 
and precinct reports that were not part of the Federal Electoral Institute 
network, people voting who were not on the lists and on and on. 
</P>
<P>
 The reactions stated were disillusioning. People stated they were assured this 
would be a clean and fair election and now were deceived another time; others 
think these elections were worse in fraud than 1988; others see a parallel of 
U.S. support regardless of fraud (as in the Dominican Republic), and calls from 
parties and organizations for nullification. The number of incidents is not 
low, with Allianza reporting for 20 states. Opposition parties had 
representatives across the country and reported similar incidents. How much 
more happened that was not observed? 
</P>
<P>
 For me, a crushed straw hat on the side of the road to Veracruz symbolizes the 
Mexico elections and the high hopes for a genuinely fair process. This hat had 
been worn by a campesino protesting non-payment from a government agency 
(reported throughout the southern states as a tactic to gain PRI -- the 
government party -- votes). The demonstration (including women and the elderly) 
blocking a road was broken up with large quantities of tear gas, people being 
beaten and shots fired. Four international visitors were there, myself 
included. 
</P>
<P>
 If this is viewed as cleaner than U.S. elections (a statement by a member of 
the House of Representatives), should we expect the same in 1996?

 * The photographs accompanying stories about the Mexican elections (Aug. 22) 
offer a jarring contrast and describe better than words the vast economic and 
social challenges facing Mexico. The larger picture shows women in Chiapas 
lined up to vote, some barefoot, others with cheap sandals, all with care-worn 
faces. On the same page is a smaller picture of PRI's winning candidate Ernesto 
Zedillo and his well-dressed daughter, looking like she has just stepped off 
the runway of a children's fashion show. She stands by a young man, dressed in 
the casual chic of a prep school kid. Both youngsters have the self-assurance 
common to upper-class children and they would be equally in place in any major 
city in the Western world. 
</P>
<P>
 President Zedillo has his work cut out, if he hopes to make improvements in 
the lives of Mexico's poor people. It remains to be seen if the PRI 
apparatchiks will permit him to do so.

POSSIBLE U.S. INVASION OF HAITI 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 * Re "Why It's Smart to Bet on a Haiti Invasion," Column Right, Aug. 21: 
</P>
<P>
 So, Jeane Kirkpatrick opposes a possible Clinton-ordered invasion of Haiti on 
the grounds that such an action would violate Haiti's sovereignty. In doing so, 
it would subvert notions of international law and national interest by arguing 
for "the use of force to 'restore democracy' as a necessary strategy for 
protecting international peace and security." 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the following quotation: "The prohibitions against the use of force 
in the U.N. Charter . . . are not absolute when issues such as 'freedom, 
democracy, and peace' are at stake." 
</P>
<P>
 The latter quote appeared in The Times on Oct. 28, 1983, when none other than 
Kirkpatrick herself was justifying the U.S. invasion of Grenada against a U.N. 
resolution condemning Reagan's action.  
</P>
<P>
 What a difference the partisan control of the presidency makes in 
Kirkpatrick's judgment of which invasions in the name of "freedom, democracy, 
and peace" are just and which ones are unconscionable violations of 
underdeveloped countries' sovereignty!

 * Re Haiti's abandoned children, Aug. 27: If we starve them with our blockade, 
it will certainly create an opinion of our country as "demon-crazy" rather than 
a democracy. Let us give Haitians a chance to live with some dignity rather 
than sacrifice so many citizens just to bolster our false egos. Maybe if we 
show concern for suffering people, even the present Haitian leaders will soften 
up. Kindness is contagious.

 * The debate over an invasion of Haiti waxes hot and heavy. According to the 
reports we read in the media, the time for action appears ripe. But I don't see 
why we should invade with a rapid deployment force. An invasion will create 
casualties and property damage for which we will become responsible. We have a 
unit in the U.S. Army, whose role is tailored to such situations: Special 
Forces. 
</P>
<P>
 The population of Haiti would like nothing better than to oust this 
coup-installed cabal now in power. It will only take a spark to explode and 
propel the natives in that direction. Instead of doing the job ourselves, let 
us give the indigenous population the chance to regain their self-respect and 
honor. 
</P>
<P>
 Let us just infiltrate a few Special Forces operational detachments, less than 
50 Green Berets, who will furnish the spark to explode the people into action. 
</P>
<P>
 We are not seeking glory. Let the Haitians bask in its warmth.

 * The people of Haiti do not want U.S. intervention under any pretense. I wish 
someone could explain to the American people the need for invasion or even the 
embargo. If American troops are used, we can expect loss of life. Haiti is 
training to meet the American threat and killing will occur on both sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps we will learn from Somalia that interference in other countries is not 
without cost. Americans were murdered, taxpayers paid for invasion costs and 
continuing medical expenses for real or imagined war syndromes. 
</P>
<P>
 We need to alert our Washington representatives to give Haiti a wide berth, if 
a helping hand is not an alternative.

2 CRUISES HALTED AS MYSTERY ILLNESS PROBE CONTINUES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Pedro-based cruise ship on which hundreds of passengers became ill 
will remain in port while federal investigators continue their search for the 
cause of the outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line said the company canceled two 
Ensenada cruises, one scheduled to depart Friday and one Monday, because the 
cause of the illness had not been determined. 
</P>
<P>
 This weekend, the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will test 
blood and stool samples collected from passengers, as well as samples from the 
ship's water supply, to try to find the source of the ailment, which forced the 
Viking Serenade back to port Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 of the Viking's 2,350 passengers and crew reported symptoms such 
as vomiting and diarrhea, and one 78-year-old man died -- apparently of a heart 
attack -- after he fell ill and was hospitalized in Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
 Three passengers were hospitalized in San Pedro on Friday in fair condition, 
said a spokeswoman for San Pedro Peninsula Hospital. Five people admitted 
earlier to an Ensenada hospital were transferred to a hospital in San Diego.

EFFORT TO RETRIEVE VINTAGE SPY PLANE IS STYMIED; MILITARY: BAD WEATHER, ILLNESS 
CONSPIRE AGAINST GROUP'S PLAN TO SALVAGE B-29. THE KEE BIRD CRASHED IN 
GREENLAND IN 1947 WHILE ON A RECONNAISSANCE MISSION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bad weather and illness among crew members have forced suspension of efforts 
to retrieve a B-29 from the arctic wastes of Greenland until spring. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Air Force has been providing logistic support to a private group trying to 
retrieve the B-29 nicknamed the Kee Bird. The big bomber crash-landed on a 
frozen lake while on a spy mission Feb. 21, 1947. 
</P>
<P>
 "That bird has been there for 47 years, it can wait a few more months," Air 
Force spokesman Tech. Sgt. Scott Milne said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of the top-secret Project Nanook, the Kee Bird was looking for 
evidence that the Soviet Union was building military bases north of the Arctic 
Circle. The plane became lost and ended up landing 1,000 miles off course; 
after three days, all 11 crew members were rescued. 
</P>
<P>
 The delay in retrieving the Kee Bird, although disappointing to those who have 
struggled against bitter cold and driving rain, does not surprise aviation 
observers who have followed similar efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 Wayman Dunlap, editor of Oceanside-based Pacific Flyer Aviation News, said 
retrieval missions routinely take much longer and cost much more than the 
organizers estimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you're trying to get one of these war birds out of a remote location, 
the rule is to figure out how long it will take, then double that amount of 
time and that's still not long enough," Dunlap said. "The same is true with 
money. Take all the money you can get, double it and it's still only half 
enough." 
</P>
<P>
 Milne said the retrieval team, headed by Orange County businessman and former 
Army pilot Tom Hess and retired Lockheed test pilot Darryl Greenamyer, 
succeeded in replacing the Kee Bird's four engines and putting the plane in 
running order before the chief mechanic was stricken with a bleeding ulcer and 
an early winter storm dropped eight inches of snow on the makeshift runway. 
</P>
<P>
 "They could get the plane started fine, but they couldn't get it off the 
ground because of the lack of a decent runway," Milne said. 
</P>
<P>
 The team plans to return next spring when the arctic weather eases and 
temperatures again creep above freezing. 
</P>
<P>
 Using Thule Air Force Base as a staging ground, the retrieval team has been 
ferrying supplies 250 miles north to the crash site in an aging Army transport, 
a C-7 Caribou. The Caribou, owned by Greenamyer, is built for short landings 
and takeoffs, but the B-29 requires a 4,000-foot-long runway for safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The plan had been to fly the Kee Bird to Thule for additional repairs and then 
fly it to the United States in time for the Reno National Championship Air 
Races in September. 
</P>
<P>
 The possible return of the Kee Bird had caused considerable interest in 
aviation circles. 
</P>
<P>
 Of 4,000 B-29 Superfortresses built during World War II, only one is still 
flying. That plane, rescued from the Naval Weapons Center at China Lake in the 
Mojave Desert, is called Fifi and is the possession of the Texas-based 
Confederate Air Force, a private group dedicated to the restoration of World 
War II aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Given the Kee Bird's colorful history, and the general clamor for restored 
aircraft, aviation observers expect that Hess and Greenamyer, who both live in 
Rancho Santa Fe, will have no trouble selling the plane for a profit. 
</P>
<P>
 Dunlap said that after he was quoted in a newspaper story about the Kee Bird, 
he received a call from an agent for a moneyed businessman willing to pay $1 
million for the plane sight unseen. 
</P>
<P>
 The Kee Bird, flying out of Ladd Field in Fairbanks, Alaska, became lost when 
bad weather engulfed the plane and prevented navigators from seeing enough 
stars to determine their location. As it ran out of fuel, the pilot landed on 
frozen land with only minimal damage to the aircraft. 
</P>
<P>
 Three days later, the 11 crew members were brought to safety in a rescue 
effort so daring it earned the rescue crew a trip to the White House to receive 
congratulations from President Harry S. Truman. 
</P>
<P>
 Kee Bird crewmen were warned never to reveal the nature of their mission. The 
commander of Project Nanook ordered that the Kee Bird be bombed to prevent it 
from falling into Soviet hands, but the order was never carried out.

STATE SAYS 'MYSTERY FUMES' PROBABLY A CASE OF MASS HYSTERIA; HOSPITALS: REPORT 
DOES NOT RULE OUT EXPOSURE TO TOXIC SUBSTANCE. EMERGENCY ROOM WORKERS CRITICIZE 
THE STUDY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 The emergency room attendants who fell ill last February while treating a 
dying cancer patient in the so-called mystery fumes case probably succumbed to 
mass hysteria, the state Department of Health Services concluded in a report 
released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 It is also plausible, state officials said, that a few hospital staff members 
were exposed to something that made them ill and that others reacted to the 
stressful situation. But if there was an exposure to something, its identity 
remains unknown, said Dr. Ana Maria Osorio, chief of the health department's 
division of environmental and occupational disease control and co-author of the 
report.  
</P>
<P>
 "There doesn't seem to be a humongous big cloud of something that overwhelmed 
everybody," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Julie Gorchynski, the Riverside General Hospital emergency room physician 
most seriously injured in the incident, bitterly contested the report. She 
complained that it was issued before all the facts surrounding the event have 
been analyzed. Gorchynski faces possible permanent bone damage to her knees 
that she blames on exposure to the fumes. 
</P>
<P>
 But epidemiology experts said that despite questions still surrounding an 
unidentified chemical discovered before the autopsy, they could find no culprit 
to explain the bizarre episode that sent six emergency room workers to 
hospitals after being exposed to patient Gloria Ramirez. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's report was the last, full-scale study by local and state agencies 
that have attempted to explain what happened Feb. 19. Each one was 
inconclusive. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the state's 15-page report, 11 people reported smelling an 
unusual odor after blood was drawn from Ramirez. After five collapsed and the 
emergency room was evacuated, a total of 23 people complained of at least one 
symptom -- most commonly headache, dizziness and nausea, the state report said. 
More serious complaints included muscle spasms and breathing disruptions. 
</P>
<P>
 "Despite extensive epidemiologic, toxicologic and environmental 
investigations, the cause of the outbreak of symptoms among (emergency room) 
staff members . . . remains unknown," the report concluded.  
</P>
<P>
 The Department of Health Services study was based on previously released 
scientific investigations and interviews with hospital staff. 
</P>
<P>
 "The findings from our and other investigations are most compatible with an 
outbreak of mass sociogenic illness, perhaps triggered by an odor," state 
doctors said. 
</P>
<P>
 The report defined mass sociogenic illness as "the occurrence in a group of 
people of physical symptoms suggesting an organic illnesses but resulting from 
anxiety or other psychological stresses." 
</P>
<P>
 The report was shared by state officials with the Riverside County hospital 
personnel who were affected by the incident, and reaction among them was mixed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gorchynski said she was "frustrated and angry because the health department's 
report is bull----. They've come up with conclusions based on only partial 
data. 
</P>
<P>
 "They didn't refer to my medical records, or the toxicology report from the 
coroner's office or wait until the final analysis" of a still-unidentified 
chemical was complete, Gorchynski said. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen Welch, a respiratory therapist who was hospitalized nearly a week 
after the incident and who has filed a $3-million injury claim against the 
county, was more resigned. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're dissatisfied and disappointed," she said. "Something happened that 
night. We all know that. It absolutely was not sociogenic. But mysteries in 
medicine occur, and this may just be something we have to accept. Maybe there's 
no one in this world who can figure this out." 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Bradley Gilbert, the Riverside County public health officer, praised the 
study. But "it's frustrating to realize that we may never know what actually 
happened," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Echoing a report by Cal/OSHA, the Department of Health Services report said an 
unidentified, nitrogen-based chemical was detected later inside the coroner's 
bag containing Ramirez's body. The mystery chemical's presence was intriguing 
but its significance in the outbreak of symptoms remains unknown, Osorio said.  
</P>
<P>
 Scientists at the Lawrence Livermore Laboratory forensic science center are 
still trying to identify the compound and if they succeed, she said, the 
state's report will be appended. 
</P>
<P>
 Dr. Christopher Jobe of Loma Linda University Medical Center, who is treating 
Gorchynski's knee problem, said Gorchynski was disabled by something other than 
mass hysteria. She has filed a $6-million claim against the county. 
</P>
<P>
 "She had too many things go wrong with her to make it hysterical -- bone 
necrosis, elevated liver and pancreatic enzymes, gastritis, hepatitis and 
unexplained crystals in her own blood that were seen by a doctor and a nurse at 
a different hospital," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm not sure we will know the answer, but we know that something organic 
happened," he said. "Besides, these are E.R. people -- adrenaline junkies who 
wouldn't react hysterically. They're the wrong personality type."

HEAD OF BROWN'S ELECTION EFFORT QUITS UMBERG CAMPAIGN POST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By AMY WALLACE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Clint Reilly, chairman of Democrat Kathleen Brown's campaign for governor, has 
stepped aside as the top campaign strategist for Assemblyman Tom Umberg, the 
Orange County Democrat who is seeking to unseat Atty. Gen. Dan Lungren in 
November. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly said that it had become hard for him to do both jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 Veteran political consultant Richie Ross of Sacramento will become Umberg's 
chief campaign consultant and election strategist.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're doing a disservice to Umberg. . . . He deserves to have someone who can 
focus on his campaign," Reilly said, adding that "there have been some things 
that have fallen through the cracks." Reilly will continue to be a consultant 
to the Umberg campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "The client has to feel they're getting 100% from you and your firm," he said. 
"Given our responsibilities (in the Brown campaign), we need to do the right 
thing and let him have somebody who's totally focused on his race." 
</P>
<P>
 Umberg's staff said the change in consultants would not interrupt the 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not skipping a beat," said George Urch, Umberg's campaign manager. 
"Richie Ross is one of the best consultants in the state and we're looking 
forward to working with him and also with Clint to defeat Lungren this fall." 
</P>
<P>
 Sources close to the campaign said that Umberg had been dissatisfied with the 
amount of attention Reilly had devoted to his campaign. One bone of contention, 
the sources said, was a campaign brochure Reilly produced in which Umberg's 
eyes appeared to be closed. 
</P>
<P>
 Reilly said he ordered that brochure reprinted with better photographs at his 
own expense. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the most unhappy person," he said, "was me."

STATE SUES OVER ORDER TO REPAY STUDENT AID 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From a Times Staff Writer 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The state attorney general's office filed a suit Friday against the U.S. 
Department of Education, contesting the federal agency's order that the 
California Student Aid Commission pay $62.6 million for allegedly violating 
rules of the federal student loan program. 
</P>
<P>
 The commission asked the attorney general's office to file the lawsuit during 
a closed-door session Friday, spokesman Dana Callihan said.Commission Chairman 
Michael Carona had said earlier that a lawsuit was possible if the Education 
Department did not reconsider its demands. 
</P>
<P>
 The source of the dispute stems from an audit last year by the Education 
Department, after which it charged that the state commission had collected 
millions of dollars more than it deserved from the federal government 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials also said the commission had not been aggressive enough in 
trying to collect millions of dollars in defaulted loans.

TOUGHER PUNISHMENT URGED FOR L.A. DOCTOR; HEALTH: DIRECTOR ASKS MEDICAL BOARD 
TO REVOKE LICENSE OF PHYSICIAN AFTER DEATHS OF TWO WOMEN WHO HAD ABORTIONS AT 
HIS CLINICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JACK CHEEVERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The Medical Board of California's executive director has asked board members 
to reconsider a decision not to revoke the license of a Los Angeles doctor 
accused of incompetence and negligence in the deaths of two young women who 
underwent abortions at his clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, the medical board suspended Dr. Leo F. Kenneally's license for a 
year and placed him on 10 years probation, noting that his clinics in Pacoima 
and central Los Angeles are among the few places where low-income women can get 
affordable abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the disciplinary action fell far short of the license cancellation sought 
by medical board executive director Dixon Arnett, who wants another hearing on 
the matter. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical board accused Kenneally in 1990 of failing to quickly call 
paramedics when an 18-year-old woman stopped breathing and suffered cardiac 
arrest while undergoing an abortion in 1987. The woman was admitted to a 
hospital, where she died about two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Board investigators also said Kenneally did not properly care for a woman who 
suffered a seizure during a 1986 abortion. Kenneally continued to perform the 
abortion rather than deal with the seizure, the board said. The woman, 22, 
later was taken to a hospital, where she was pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also accused Kenneally of mishandling five other abortions that 
resulted in injuries between 1988 and 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In a May 27 ruling, Administrative Law Judge Milford A. Maron agreed that 
Kenneally was negligent in the two deaths. But the judge wrote that Kenneally 
is an "unselfish and committed provider" of abortions in poor neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneally operates Her Medical Clinics at 13309 Van Nuys Blvd. and 2700 
Figueroa St., and has performed about 100,000 abortions in the last 10 years, 
according to the medical board. 
</P>
<P>
 In an Aug. 26 petition filed on Arnett's behalf, state Deputy Atty. Gen. 
Adrian K. Panton asked six members of the medical board to reconsider whether 
to revoke Kenneally's license. 
</P>
<P>
 Panton said that in four of the five cases cited between 1988 and '93, 
Kenneally delayed sending the women to hospitals for emergency treatment. In 
the fifth case, the woman was released from a clinic in so much pain that she 
collapsed an hour later. 
</P>
<P>
 Panton also said the terms of Kenneally's probation were too lenient, urging 
that the physician be monitored by another doctor and required to undergo an 
intensive clinical training program and pass an exam. 
</P>
<P>
 In a petition opposing Panton, Kenneally's attorney, Jay N. Hartz, said it was 
unnecessary and unfair to force Kenneally to undergo another license hearing.

ORANGE COUNTY PERSPECTIVE; WEAK BUT NEEDED SAFETY STEP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bill allowing school buses to use their flashing lights and stop traffic 
more often when children are getting off is a weak but needed first step to 
prevent tragedies like the one that occurred in Laguna Niguel last April. Gov. 
Pete Wilson should sign the measure. 
</P>
<P>
 The Legislature would have been better off requiring buses to use the lights 
whenever children get off.Opponents of the original bill expressed concern for 
the safety of the children and convenience of motorists, but their arguments 
were weak. 
</P>
<P>
 The final measure, authored by Sen. Marian Bergeson (R-Newport Beach), lets 
school districts decide the stops where drivers should flash warning lights 
even when a child is not crossing the street. Current law requires school bus 
drivers to use the flashing lights only when a child will cross.

 The bill resulted from the death of Tommy Lanni, 7, who was killed on his 
second day at school in Orange County after his family moved from New York. It 
was his first day riding the bus and the child got off one stop too early. He 
was hit trying to cross the street to what he apparently thought was his house. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither the driver of a car that struck the boy nor the school bus driver were 
charged in the incident. Investigators said the bus driver thought neither the 
boy nor others getting off the bus would cross the street, so he did not use 
the lights. 
</P>
<P>
 Lanni's father deserves credit for working to change state law, though he is 
understandably upset at the compromise that resulted. But rather than urging a 
veto, he should concentrate on his other promise -- to continue working for a 
bill requiring flashing lights whenever children are getting off the bus.

SAMPRAS LEADS FANS TO TENNIS' PROMISED LAND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Pancho Gonzales and Rod Laver dominated tennis in their day. Now, when Pete 
Sampras serves 130-m.p.h. aces clipping alternate sidelines, journalists 
grumble there are no jokes in the press conference.Must we call in Billy 
Crystal? (Mike Downey, Aug. 31). Along with boxing, tennis is one of the few 
sports that's a single person-to-person confrontation. The degree of mental 
focus and physical capacity needed to win is awesome. For our time, Sampras has 
this; he will surely go down as one of the all-time greats. We should applaud 
him, not limit him to only one serve or demand Jay Leno one-liners.

STOCK IS BATTERED, BUT AST OFFICIALS SEE A PROFIT AT END OF TUNNEL; EARNINGS: 
SHARE VALUE TUMBLED IN WAKE OF LOSS DISCLOSURE. IRVINE-BASED FIRM SAYS NEW 
PRODUCTS WILL RESTORE GROWTH.

 Although AST Research Inc.'s stock took a beating this week after it disclosed 
that it would post a loss in the current quarter, the computer maker is poised 
for growth and profitability in coming months, analysts and AST officials said 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The company, the world's fifth-largest manufacturer of personal computers, is 
banking on several soon-to-be-unveiled models to revive profits. The company 
has also overhauled its manufacturing operations and is bolstering its 
management staff and internal quality controls to overcome delays that cost it 
dearly last month. 
</P>
<P>
 The new models, analysts and AST executives say, should carry prices high 
enough to help the company avoid some of the cutthroat discounting that has 
hurt the industry in general and AST in particular. "If you are there with the 
right product, you can charge a lot; whoever misses the boat goes down," Jeff 
Kilpatrick, president of brokerage Newport Securities Corp. in Newport Beach, 
said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 AST's stock, which lost 27% of its value Thursday after the company said it 
expects to post a loss for the current quarter, crept up 18.75 cents on Friday 
to close at $13.25 a share on the Nasdaq market system. 
</P>
<P>
 Wall Street has been knocking down AST all year as the company failed to meet 
earlier earnings projections. Investors also worried about the depth of the 
problems at the company and its ability to reorganize its manufacturing 
operations and its top management. In addition, several nagging lawsuits, 
including a patent infringement case, are pending against the firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts, however, tend to agree with James T. Schraith, the company's 
president, that AST will recover and will continue to be one of the top five 
computer manufacturers worldwide. 
</P>
<P>
 "The problems are primarily internal, and we believe we have a handle on 
them," Schraith said. 
</P>
<P>
 Only a month ago, AST was confident about its prospects as it completed its 
consolidation of overseas manufacturing operations and promoted Schraith to the 
top operations position, just under chairman and co-founder Safi U. Qureshey. 
But an unusual confluence of new product delays, parts shortages and atypically 
lower profit margins crippled the company in a month. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Two models of its Ascentia notebook computer and Advantage desktop model 
were late to market because of supply problems.  
</P>
<P>
 * The debut of the company's Bravo MS desktop computer was delayed by 
technical problems with the computer's motherboard, a basic computer component. 
To avoid similar problems in the future, Schraith plans to integrate the 
engineering and design groups with the manufacturing group. 
</P>
<P>
 Throughout the year, AST has operated on slim profit margins, compared to the 
rest of the industry, said analyst William J. Milton Jr. of Brown Brothers 
Harriman in New York. The latest industry price cuts -- ranging from 22% to 27% 
-- could further exacerbate AST's condition, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They have a bunch of new products, but so do their competitors," Milton said. 
"What I want to know is why, when they are so similar in what they do, why 
AST's profit margins are half what Compaq's are." 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from its operating woes, AST also is defending itself against two 
lawsuits. The company says, however, that neither should have a material impact 
on the company's financial health. 
</P>
<P>
 In one court action, Texas Instruments Inc. in Dallas accuses AST of 
infringing on its patents. AST charges that TI failed to honor royalty rights 
AST acquired when it bought Tandy Corp.'s computer division last summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Last March, shareholders filed two lawsuits, accusing AST of issuing false and 
misleading statements about its anticipated quarterly earnings and revenue. A 
trial in that case is set for March 28.

DESPITE WALL ST. HAMMERING, AST RESEARCH STILL HAS PLENTY OF FANS

 The Irvine-based company, the world's fifth-largest manufacturer of personal

lower profit margins crippled the company in a month. Among them: 
</P>
<P>
 * Two models of its Ascentia notebook computer and Advantage desktop model 
were late to market because of supply problems. One supplier sent a batch of 
faulty floppy disk drives, and AST needed time to work out the bugs. Another 
supplier cut short a shipment of microprocessors, and AST had to pay more for 
replacement chips. 
</P>
<P>
 An AST spokeswoman said executives are putting together a new strategy for 
managing supplies, and new executives are being hired to oversee that 
operation. 
</P>
<P>
 * The debut of the company's Bravo MS desktop computer was delayed by 
technical problems with the computer's motherboard, a basic computer component. 
To avoid similar problems in the future, Schraith plans to integrate the 
engineering and design groups with the manufacturing group. 
</P>
<P>
 In the next few months, AST will offer a host of new computer products, from 
simple computer models for beginners to sophisticated mainframe machines. The 
company hopes the new products will help restore its profitability during the 
first three months of 1995. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some analysts worry that AST's position is more precarious than the 
public knows. The company has reported disappointing earnings all year, 
prompting earlier drops in its stock price from its high of $33 a share this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 In early March, AST's stock price fell $8 a share in two days, from $31.50 to 
$23.50, after it said it couldn't live up to earlier earnings projections. In 
July, the stock fell $2.25 a share when fiscal fourth-quarter earnings were 
short of Wall Street expectations.

TWO TOP BIDDERS ON INTERACTIVE TV LICENSES ARE PROBE TARGETS; REGULATION: FCC 
SOURCE SAYS SUN VALLEY FIRM AND ANOTHER ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION FOR CLAIMS THAT 
ENTITLED THEM TO DISCOUNTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A Sun Valley company and another firm that were the two largest bidders in the 
Federal Communications Commission's recent blockbuster auction for interactive 
television licenses are the subjects of criminal investigation, according to a 
well-placed source. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive America Corp., which lists for its headquarters the address of a 
ramshackle house in Sun Valley with miniature horses in the yard, submitted the 
second-highest bid in the July auction. The largest came from Commercial Realty 
St. Pete Inc. of St. Petersburg, Fla., whose bid of about $40 million was 
reduced to about $33 million with the discount. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigations in both cases focus on the two firms claiming to be 
female-owned small businesses and thus qualified for discounts on their bids, 
the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the nation's first sale of licenses to market interactive services such 
as home shopping and home banking over the airwaves. The sale drew more than 
$215 million in bids, far more than expected. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive identified itself in the FCC application as a woman-owned small 
business, thereby qualifying for a $3.3-million discount on the $17 million it 
bid for 15 separate licenses. But the woman's identity has not been revealed, 
and Interactive America -- along with several other winning bidders -- has not 
made the down payment on the license that was due last month. 
</P>
<P>
 Interactive America President Christopher Pedersen could not be reached for 
comment. He has previously refused to provide any details on the company's 
history or financing, but he has said the company did not withhold its 
$1.37-million down payment because it lacked funds. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the down payment was withheld because the company objects to the FCC's 
approval of only one supplier of interactive television equipment. Without 
other suppliers, he contends, it would be impossible to meet the deadlines for 
building the networks. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, the FCC said it was launching an investigation into 
possible misrepresentation by some companies regarding their claimed status as 
minority- or woman-owned. The agency did not identify the firms, though 
Commercial Realty St. Pete has been cited in news reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC also said it is looking into whether some of the defaulting firms 
might have entered the bidding with no intention or ability to pay. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of these companies might have become caught up in "auction fever" and bid 
higher than they intended, but others might have used the auction process as a 
means to abscond with investors' money, the source said. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation will also target bidders who may have encouraged other 
buyers to default on their payments, the FCC has said. Commercial Realty St. 
Pete is also under investigation on that score. 
</P>
<P>
 The FCC inquiry, similar to a grand jury investigation, involves subpoenaing 
witnesses and documents. When the process is complete, the agency may refer its 
findings to the Justice Department, possibly resulting in criminal indictments.

 When Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates decided to back a Washington state 
legislative candidate who is married to one of his employees, he did it in 
typical fashion -- via electronic mail. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandra Jacobson sent Gates an e-mail note about her husband, Stu, a liberal 
Democrat running in Gates' home district. 
</P>
<P>
 "It sounds like we agree on many things," Gates wrote. "I am willing to 
endorse Stu. . . . Of course, I can't put any time into it but you can mention 
me as a supporter." 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Van Luven, Jacobson's Republican opponent, said of Gates' notes: "I 
don't think the public cares what he does."

STATE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE DIPS IN AUGUST; ECONOMY: U.S. FIGURE HOLDS STEADY AT 
6.1% WHILE CALIFORNIA'S FALLS TO 8.9%. PAYROLLS REPORT IS WEAKER THAN EXPECTED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The nation's brisk employment growth slowed last month, leaving the U.S. 
jobless rate unchanged at 6.1%, but unemployment in California edged down to 
8.9% from 9.0% in July amid spreading signs of modest improvement in the 
state's long-depressed economy. 
</P>
<P>
 Separately, government officials reported Friday that the closely watched 
national survey of employer payrolls rose by 179,000 in August. The gain was 
solid, but it was less than expected and well below the average monthly 
increase of 293,000 jobs this year. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts said the more modest improvement reflects a broad trend in an economy 
that, while still healthy, is beginning to be restrained by rising interest 
rates engineered by an inflation-wary Federal Reserve Board. 
</P>
<P>
 "The economy is slowing down," said David A. Wyss, research director for the 
economic consulting firm DRI/McGraw-Hill in Lexington, Mass. "A lot of it is 
because the Fed has been trying to slow things down, and this is evidence that 
they are succeeding."  
</P>
<P>
 In California, the payroll survey indicated that employment rose by a scant 
500 jobs in August, but analysts were buoyed by upward revisions in figures 
reported earlier for June and July. Those changes turned what previously 
appeared to be a loss of 6,100 jobs during the two months into an increase of 
12,900. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, economists said the payroll survey -- even though it is widely 
considered the best gauge of the national job market -- appears to be 
understating California's fledgling recovery. 
</P>
<P>
 A report due out next week from the California Department of Finance is 
expected to say that employment in the state is up by about 200,000 jobs from a 
year ago. By contrast, the government's payroll survey shows a decline of 
23,800 jobs during the same period. 
</P>
<P>
 Ted Gibson, principal economist for the department, said the state's rising 
payroll tax revenues, increasing retail sales and a pickup in construction all 
appear to reflect the beginnings of a significant pickup in the labor market. 
"We are getting signs of recovery from all of these sources," he said. "To get 
that kind of growth, you've got to have employment growth." 
</P>
<P>
 All of the state's best economic indicators "show that the economy is moving 
forward," said Joseph A. Wahed, chief economist for Wells Fargo Bank in San 
Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts, noting that the payroll survey does not track employment growth at 
small firms, contend that many of California's new jobs are at such businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, there was little encouraging news for Los Angeles County, one of the 
sickliest areas in the California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 The county's unemployment level -- which, unlike the federal and state rates, 
is not adjusted for seasonal trends -- climbed to 10.3% from 10.0% in July. 
Because it is based on a small sampling of employers, the county's rate is 
often volatile, and the three-tenths of a percentage point rise was not 
considered statistically significant. 
</P>
<P>
 Even though the employment report signaled a slowing economy, inflation-minded 
Wall Street investors reacted coolly to the news. Bonds prices rose sharply 
early in the day but retreated later. Investors appeared to be concerned about 
a small rise in hourly wages and reported increases in manufacturing jobs and 
working hours. 
</P>
<P>
 More important, however, was the announcement of the Columbia University 
inflation index, which hit a five-year high in August. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow Jones industrial average fell 15.86 points to 3,885.58. 
</P>
<P>
 Many economists said Wall Street overreacted. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clinton Administration lauded the employment report. "The great American 
jobs machine continues to hum along as we had expected, and we are doing it in 
a non-inflationary environment," Labor Secretary Robert Reich said. 
</P>
<P>
 Economists were reluctant to read too much into Friday's figures. They said 
the survey was taken too early in August to account for back-to-school hiring 
by retailers. August employment figures are often skewed by workers' vacation 
schedules, resulting in major revisions later on. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the 11 big states whose jobless rates were reported Friday, California 
continued to post the highest unemployment. Next came New York, at 6.9%, and 
Texas, at 6.6%. 
</P>
<P>
 The lowest rate was recorded by North Carolina, at 5.2%, followed by Ohio, at 
5.4%, and Florida, at 5.6%.

A CRISIS ON HOLD; STATE PLODS ON DESPITE PULLBACK BY INSURERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By THOMAS S. MULLIGAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the time came this week for the insurance industry to rally state 
lawmakers to alleviate the California insurance crisis, the crisis turned up 
missing. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite predictions that the pullback of big insurers from the state's 
homeowners and earthquake market would stymie home sales and cripple the 
economic recovery, it hadn't happened by the time the Legislature closed up 
shop for the year on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 The industry, accordingly, had no luck securing passage of legislation that 
would have created a state-backed earthquake insurance pool to help insulate 
insurers against another Northridge earthquake -- or a worse one. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tough trying to sell a future crisis," admitted Bill Sirola, spokesman 
for State Farm Mutual Automobile Insurance, which, as the nation's largest 
homeowners carrier, took the lead in vainly pushing the earthquake pool idea in 
Sacramento. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the lack of a clear-cut emergency, other factors also contributed to 
the industry's inability to put its plans across. Those factors included the 
complexity of the issue, the lack of time to consider it and fears that a 
California solution would take pressure off Congress to pass federal disaster 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
 Insurers and officials such as Marjorie M. Berte, Gov. Pete Wilson's insurance 
adviser, still fear the shoe will drop. For the moment, however, real estate 
and escrow agents insist they have seen few if any sales scuttled because a 
buyer failed to secure insurance. Delays, yes; busted deals, no. 
</P>
<P>
 But if the crisis hasn't emerged full-blown, that's not to say that the Jan. 
17 earthquake hasn't caused real problems. 
</P>
<P>
 Today, earthquake and homeowners insurance -- particularly for new customers 
-- is harder to find and often less comprehensive and more expensive than it 
was last spring, before three-quarters of the state's insurers began 
restricting sales. 
</P>
<P>
 Take Mark Green of Santa Monica, for example. He got a letter in the mail last 
June from his carrier, New Jersey-based Chubb Insurance Group, telling him his 
homeowners policy would not be renewed because his house was built before 1945. 
</P>
<P>
 Chubb, of course, had known the age of the house when it renewed his policy 
the previous seven times, but that was before Northridge. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing an Aug. 24 expiration date -- Chubb gave him a month's extension at no 
cost -- Green scrambled to get his 1925 home retrofitted. Some carriers will 
insure old homes if they've been bolted to the foundation, for example. But 
Green still couldn't find a conventional insurer to take his business, so he 
was forced to buy a fire and earthquake policy from the California Fair Plan, 
the industry-sponsored insurer of last resort. 
</P>
<P>
 Historically, the Fair Plan has sold its bare-bones fire insurance in 
brush-fire zones that regular companies consider too hazardous to write. Last 
June, however, as major carriers such as State Farm, Allstate Insurance Co., 
Farmers Insurance Group and 20th Century Insurance Co. were restricting their 
writings of new homeowners and earthquake insurance, Insurance Commissioner 
John Garamendi ordered the Fair Plan to extend its coverage area statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 Fair Plan policies don't include liability coverage and other features found 
in most homeowners policies, so Green had to find a "wraparound" policy to fill 
in the gaps. He ended up paying substantially more -- without even including 
the money he spent on retrofitting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not so much that I'm mad at Chubb as at the industry," Green said. "I 
don't feel they're really taking care of their customers." 
</P>
<P>
 A comprehensive policy that used to cost $1,000 a few months ago can cost 
three times that today, said Trish Halfacre, an independent agent in West Los 
Angeles. Several times, she has had to cobble together coverage from the Fair 
Plan plus one or two specialized -- and expensive -- carriers such as Lloyd's 
of London to replace a conventional homeowners policy. 
</P>
<P>
 And even those with current homeowners policies have often been unable to 
increase their coverage limits or add earthquake coverage, Halfacre said. "I 
feel sorry for people trying to find coverage, I really do," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Despairing of any legislative solution and fearful of Northridge II, the 
sequel, Dallas-based Republic Insurance Co. last week became the first sizable 
company to announce that it would withdraw from California rather than simply 
declare a moratorium on new sales. 
</P>
<P>
 One bill that did emerge from the Legislature this week would empower the 
governor -- upon a finding by the insurance commissioner that an availability 
crisis exists -- to prevent insurers from terminating or refusing to renew 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 Garamendi is urging Wilson to sign the bill. However, Berte, Wilson's adviser, 
said the legislation presents "philosophical problems" in that it orders a 
private company to sell a product. "This is not a public utility we're talking 
about," Berte said. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Legislature through for the year, Garamendi is planning to jump into 
the breach. He has scheduled hearings for Sept. 28-29 in San Francisco on 
earthquake rate increase applications filed by numerous carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, Garamendi -- whose term ends in January -- will try to 
develop his own solution to the availability problems, an approach that may 
involve using the Fair Plan as a vehicle for a stand-alone earthquake insurance 
pool. The issues are complex, Garamendi's chief spokeswoman said, so he will 
proceed deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, some consumers are waiting. Said Green, the Santa Monica homeowner: 
"It's sort of a small crisis, but not for people that are stuck in it." 
Insurance Aftershocks 
</P>
<P>
 Predictions of an "insurance market meltdown" in California following the 
Northridge earthquake have yet to come true. But the aftershocks continue, as 
the following chronology shows: 
</P>
<P>
 Jan. 17: Northridge earthquake, magnitude 6.8, jolts Los Angeles. Early 
estimates of insurance losses approach $2 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 April 7: Official insured loss estimate jumps to $4.5 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 April 20: 20th Century Industries posts record $256-million first-quarter 
loss, wiping out more than half its capital, on estimated quake claims of $475 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 May 24: 20th Century, at its annual meeting, says losses may force it to go on 
the sales block. 
</P>
<P>
 June 9: 20th Century strikes a deal with the state allowing it to stop selling 
earthquake insurance and wind down its homeowners insurance business. 
</P>
<P>
 June 16: Farmers Insurance Group, No. 3 in California, stops selling new 
homeowners and earthquake policies. 
</P>
<P>
 June 21: Market leader State Farm warns of a "looming crisis" and proposes 
creation of a state-backed earthquake insurance pool. It also continues 
tightening restrictions on sales. 
</P>
<P>
 June 22: Insurance Commissioner John Garamendi orders the California Fair Plan 
to extend its limited fire and earthquake coverage statewide. 
</P>
<P>
 June 30: No. 2 Allstate suspends new sales of homeowners and earthquake 
policies. 
</P>
<P>
 July 7: Garamendi begins holding private meetings with insurers, consumer 
advocates and others to seek a solution. 
</P>
<P>
 July 15: Farmers moves to hike deductibles on earthquake policies to 25%. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 18: California Supreme Court upholds Proposition 103 regulations, 
clearing the way for rebates of up to $1 billion -- more than $100 million of 
which is owed by 20th Century, whose estimated quake claims are now $685 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 29: Republic Insurance Co. announces withdrawal from California. 
</P>
<P>
 Aug. 31: Legislature adjourns without passing industry-sponsored bills to 
create an earthquake insurance pool. Quake loss estimates now exceed $7 
billion.

 Jury Awards $28.6 Million for Asthma Drug Damage: The award went to a man who 
suffered brain damage after using a common asthma drug made by Key 
Pharmaceuticals Inc., a subsidiary of Schering-Plough Corp. of Madison, N.J. 
Paul R. Bocci III, 24, lost his short-term memory ability as a result of a 
toxic reaction to the drug, Theo-Dur. According to evidence at a trial in 
Portland, Ore., Key Pharmaceuticals sold the drug without adequately informing 
doctors about problems associated with its use. Schering-Plough criticized the 
verdict and said it plans to appeal.

<P>
 The government's report on August employment reignited inflation fears Friday, 
erasing a morning rally in stocks and handing the Dow Jones industrial average 
its third consecutive loss. 
</P>
<P>
 The Dow fell 15.86 points to 3,885.58 after having risen 18 points early on. 
Despite losses that began Wednesday, the widely followed blue chip average 
still managed a 4.53-point gain for the week, extending a 125-point run-up the 
previous week. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,072 to 952 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. But volume was only 216 million shares, as many traders beat an early 
exit ahead of Monday's Labor Day and Tuesday's Rosh Hashanah holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Smaller stocks outperformed the blue chip market. The Nasdaq composite index 
inched up 0.28 point to 759.23. 
</P>
<P>
 In the bond market, the yield on the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose to 
7.49% from 7.45% on Thursday, and shorter-term yields also closed marginally 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, stocks rose and bond yields dropped after the Labor Department said 
the nation's unemployment rate held steady at 6.1% in August. The report also 
said non-farm payrolls increased by just 179,000 jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 But then, some investors fretted over other aspects of the report -- such as 
higher wage rates -- that suggested inflation pressures. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders also said rumors began to circulate that an index created at 
Columbia's Center for International Business Cycle Research would show much 
higher inflation in August. The index, released midmorning, was 111.4, up two 
points from July and at a five-year high. 
</P>
<P>
 Market participants have been looking in every corner for signs of inflation. 
The Columbia report in particular worried bond traders because it is said to be 
closely watched by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, some analysts said the fade in stocks and bonds Friday was simply due 
to traders squaring positions before leaving for the long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Currency dealers, who have been following American securities markets lately 
to gauge demand for dollars, responded to the weakness in stocks and bonds by 
dumping the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Some dealers had taken large dollar positions as the currency rose earlier 
this week on expectations that the employment report would bolster the bond 
market. When yields ended higher Friday, they had to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5561 German marks, down 
from 1.5750 on Thursday, and at 99.12 Japanese yen, down from 99.63. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's highlights:  
</P>
<P>
 * Takeover rumors boosted some issues. American Express rose 1/2 to 29 after a 
Business Week report saying the credit card unit of General Electric had 
approached the finance company about a buyout. GE denied the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Elsewhere, drug giant Warner-Lambert rose 1 1/2 to 83 5/8 amid continued 
speculation that the company is on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaker Oats, which has been in the takeover rumor mill for months, added 5/8 
to 79 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Tech stocks were mixed after a steep drop in that sector Thursday. AST, 
which led computer stocks lower Thursday, rose 3/16 to 13 1/4. But Texas 
Instruments fell 1 3/8 to 75 3/4 and IBM eased 5/8 to 67 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 * Wireless communications stocks tumbled, led by Nextel Communications, off 2 
3/4 to 22 1/2 after MCI withdrew from talks to invest in Nextel. MCI rose 1/4 
to 24 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Frankfurt's DAX index added 3.91 points to 2,204.71, a rise of 43.17 
from last Friday. London's FTSE-100 index was up 6.2 points to 3,222.7 and 
Tokyo's Nikkei index gained 10.90 points to 20,653.83. 
</P>
<P>
 In Mexico City, the Bolsa index lost 18.59 points to 2,675.02, its seventh 
consecutive drop.

 Big Jetliner Orders Seen from Leasing Firm: The European airplane consortium 
Airbus Industrie is expected next week to announce a $900-million sale of about 
15 new Airbus jets to International Lease Finance Corp., a major aircraft 
lessor based in Beverly Hills.ILFC is also expected to order four 767 airliners 
from Boeing Co., valued at about $360 million. ILFC executives were traveling 
to a British air show -- where those orders and several others are expected to 
be announced -- and were unavailable for comment. Jetliner orders have been 
weak for several years, but Boeing said it expects the market to rebound in 
1996-97.

 The Dow fell 15.86 points to 3,885.58 after having risen 18 points early on. 
Despite losses that began Wednesday, the widely followed blue chip average 
still managed a 4.53-point gain for the week, extending a 125-point run-up last 
week. 
</P>
<P>
 Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,072 to 952 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Volume was only 216.15 million shares, down from 282.84 million on 
Thursday, as many investors beat an early exit ahead of Monday's Labor Day and 
Tuesday's Rosh Hashanah holidays. 
</P>
<P>
 Small-company stocks outperformed the blue chip market, and broad market 
indexes ended mixed. The NYSE's composite index fell 1.05 points to 259.93. But 
the Nasdaq index rose 0.28 to 759.23, and the American Stock Exchange's market 
value index rose 1.52 points to 455.54. The Standard & Poor's 500 list fell 
2.18 points to 470.99. 
</P>
<P>
 The yield of the Treasury's main 30-year bond rose to 7.49% from 7.45% on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, stocks rose and yields dropped after the Labor Department said the 
nation's unemployment rate held steady at 6.1% in August. 
</P>
<P>
 But the report also said non-farm payrolls increased by 179,000 jobs, the 
smallest gain since January. 
</P>
<P>
 Traders also said rumors began to circulate that an index created at 
Columbia's Center for International Business Cycle Research would show much 
higher inflation in August. The index, released midmorning, was 111.4, up two 
points from July and at a five-year high. 
</P>
<P>
 Market participants have been looking in every corner for signs of inflation. 
Some traders saw hints of it in the jobs report, which showed higher hourly 
wages and healthy gains in manufacturing employment. But the Columbia report 
was the biggest factor in the selloff because it is said to be closely watched 
by Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenspan was a statistics student of the center's director, Geoffrey H. 
Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 But some said the fade in stocks and bonds was simply due to traders squaring 
positions before leaving for the long holiday weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 Currency dealers, who have been following American securities markets lately 
to gauge demand for dollars, responded by dumping the U.S. currency. 
</P>
<P>
 Some dealers had taken large dollar positions as the currency rose earlier 
this week on expectations for an employment report that would bolster the bond 
market. When yields ended higher, they had to get out. 
</P>
<P>
 In late New York trading, the dollar was quoted at 1.5561 marks, down from 
1.5750 on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 The dollar was also changing hands in New York at 99.12 Japanese yen, down 
from 99.63. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Friday's market highlights: 
</P>
<P>
 * Takeover rumors boosted some issues. American Express rose 1/2 to 29 after a 
Business Week report that the credit card unit of General Electric had 
approached the finance company about a buyout. GE denied the story. 
</P>
<P>
 Warner-Lambert rose 1 1/2 to 83 5/8 amid continued speculation that the 
company is on the auction block. 
</P>
<P>
 Quaker Oats, which has been in the takeover rumor mill for months, rose 5/8 to 
79 7/8. 
</P>
<P>
 * Technology stocks were mixed after a steep drop in that sector Thursday. 
AST, which led computer stocks lower Thursday, rose 3/16 to 13 1/4. But IBM 
fell 5/8 to 67 1/4 on the Big Board. 
</P>
<P>
 Nextel Communications led the action in Nasdaq trading, falling 2 3/4 to 22 
1/2 after MCI withdrew from talks to invest in the telecommunications concern. 
MCI rose 1/4 to 24 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
 Overseas, Frankfurt's 30-share DAX ended bourse trading just above 2,200. The 
DAX closed 3.91 points higher at 2,204.71, a rise of 43.17 from last Friday. In 
post-bourse trading, the index slid slightly to 2,197.38. 
</P>
<P>
 Hong Kong and Tokyo markets changed little in light trading. 
</P>
<P>
 Mexico's Bolsa market fell to 2674.15, it's seventh consecutive loss.

BIDDING WAR FOR WESTERN UNION NEARS $1 BILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Reuters 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A bidding war for Western Union Financial Services Inc. heated up Friday as 
rival suitors for the world's largest money-transfer business raised the stakes 
to nearly $1 billion. 
</P>
<P>
 Buyout specialist Forstmann Little & Co. sweetened its offer to $970 million 
for Western Union, a financially ailing unit of New Valley Corp. New Valley has 
been in Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection since March, 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 First Financial Management Corp., a diversified data-processing company, 
raised its package to $800 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But First Data Corp., the huge credit card-processing bureau that started the 
unsolicited takeover battle in June, refused to raise its $660-million bid, 
saying it was fair. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, the auction landed in Bankruptcy Court in Newark, N.J. -- where New 
Valley had filed for bankruptcy protection -- after Bankruptcy Court Judge 
Novalyn Winfield called for a "fair and level playing field" for the bids. 
</P>
<P>
 Western Union, the worldwide leader in the non-bank immediate money-transfer 
business, has had financial troubles for a decade but is not in bankruptcy. 
</P>
<P>
 The bids have risen so high that the winning package virtually guarantees that 
New Valley's creditors will be fully repaid.

 Body Shop's Stock Rebounds: Shares of Body Shop International rallied as 
traders shrugged off a U.S. magazine report debunking the image of the 
cosmetics and toiletries chain.Speculation in the British media hurt the stock 
for about two weeks before Business Ethics printed the article Thursday. On 
Friday, Body Shop's stock price gained 2.6% in London trading, closing 9.75 
cents higher at $3.565 a share. Business Ethics, based in Minneapolis, said 
environmental claims about Body Shop products were exaggerated and that some of 
the lore about their origins was fabricated. It also said some franchisees were 
unable to return spoiled cosmetics. Body Shop said it was considering legal 
action.

 Oregon Steel to Build One Mill, Close Another: The Portland company said it 
will build a $180-million combination mill and close its plate mill facility in 
Fontana, Calif., resulting in the loss of about 100 jobs and a charge of about 
$14 million, about $13 million of it related to the write-off of production 
supplies and property, plant and equipment. The company said it will close the 
facility by the end of the year due to its high operating costs, depressed 
pricing in the international large-diameter pipe market and the lack of 
domestic pipeline activity.The combination mill is subject to financing. If 
negotiations with a Portland public utility are successful, the new mill will 
be located there, Oregon Steel Mills Inc. said. If not, other locations will be 
considered.

TOYOTA, NISSAN, HONDA RAISE 1995 CAR PRICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Three Japanese auto makers announced 1995 price increases on selected cars 
Friday as the U.S. dollar's weakness against the yen continued to squeeze 
importers. 
</P>
<P>
 Lexus, the luxury division of Toyota Motor Sales U.S.A., said 1995 prices for 
its ES 300, GS 300, SC 300 and SC 400 models will be increased 5% over initial 
1994 prices on a sales-weighted average, amounting to $1,750 a car.The increase 
is 1.9% over final 1994 prices, or about $687 a car. 
</P>
<P>
 "These increases reflect the continued decline of the dollar versus the yen," 
Lexus general manager George Borst said. 
</P>
<P>
 Nissan Motor Corp. U.S.A. said it will raise the suggested retail prices of 
1995 Maxima and 240SX models an average of 2.5%, or $568 a car. 
</P>
<P>
 American Honda Motor Co. said 1995 Civic prices will be an average of 1.7% 
higher than final 1994 prices, or $225 a car. Honda makes about 75% of the 
Civics it sells in the United States at plants in Ohio and Ontario.

A MAJOR ART PLAYER CONFIRMS L.A. BRANCH; ART: PACEWILDENSTEIN HAS PLANS FOR A 
10,000-SQUARE-FOOT FACILITY IN BEVERLY HILLS, WHICH IS SHAPING UP AS THE CENTER 
OF THE WEST COAST'S BLUE-CHIP MARKET. 
</P>

<P>
 Ending months of speculation, PaceWildenstein Gallery -- the world's largest 
art dealership -- has confirmed plans that it will open in Beverly Hills next 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
 Marc Selwyn, who has become a highly visible player in the art scene during 
his four-year tenure as director of fine arts for Sotheby's West Coast 
division, will head the new branch of PaceWildenstein. The gallery will be 
located in a 10,000-square-foot, two-floor space at the corner of Wilshire 
Boulevard and Camden Drive, in a building formerly occupied by Gump's. 
Preliminary discussions to convert the space into a gallery are under way with 
Charles Gwathmey, architect of a major addition to New York's Solomon R. 
Guggenheim Museum. 
</P>
<P>
 Coming on the heels of an announcement Thursday that Sotheby's auction house 
will open expanded quarters in Beverly Hills in February -- with space to 
conduct auctions -- PaceWildenstein's plans confirm that Beverly Hills is 
shaping up as the center of the West Coast's blue-chip art market. In its new 
niche, PaceWildenstein will likely cater to a wealthy, Hollywood clientele, 
while exhibiting works by leading figures in Impressionist, modern and 
contemporary art and photography. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are very excited about opening in Los Angeles," said Arnold Glimcher, 
director of Pace Gallery of New York, reached by phone on Friday morning. "I 
believe Los Angeles has more potential for developing collectors than any other 
city in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the gallery's lease has not been signed, Glimcher plans to open in 
April, preferably about the first of the month. "We would like to have time for 
two major exhibitions before the summer," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 An art-dealer-turned-film-producer whose credits include "Gorillas in the 
Mist" and "Mambo Kings," Glimcher counts Creative Artists Agency chief Michael 
Ovitz among his top gallery clients and readily admits that film industry 
access is one reason for bringing PaceWildenstein to the West. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have been very successful in Los Angeles," Glimcher said. "But people in 
the film industry work very hard. Our best clients have so little time to come 
to New York, and I have never believed in selling paintings from 
transparencies. We will have great works in the gallery, and people can come in 
on a Saturday morning to see them."  
</P>
<P>
 In addition, PaceWildenstein will "develop new clients in Los Angeles that 
will help all the galleries," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 PaceWildenstein was formed in October by a merger of two art powerhouses that 
continue to operate as separate galleries in New York. In a deal that stunned 
the art world, Wildenstein & Co., one of the world's leading dealers in 
Impressionist and Old Master art, acquired a 49% interest in Pace Gallery, a 
major contemporary dealership that represents many renowned artists and handles 
estates of such modern giants as Pablo Picasso, Henry Moore and Alexander 
Calder. The partnership gave the new entity an inventory of unusual historical 
breadth. 
</P>
<P>
 Selwyn, a 34-year-old graduate of Stanford University and New York University 
who practiced law before joining Sotheby's, said he was attracted to his new 
job by PaceWildenstein's reputation and international scope. "I am looking 
forward to the opportunity to handle a stable of artists which is unprecedented 
for Los Angeles and whose work I am extremely passionate about," he said. "I am 
very excited about having the chance to show the work of such artists as Mark 
Rothko, Chuck Close, Pablo Picasso and Agnes Martin and to give the Southern 
California public an opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge and appreciation 
for their work." 
</P>
<P>
 He conceives of PaceWildenstein as "a cultural focal point" rather than a 
traditional gallery. "I plan to use the resources of Pace-Wildenstein to 
continue the educational program and lectures which have been so popular at 
Sotheby's," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Glimcher, the exhibition program is likely to rotate from 
contemporary art to Impressionist paintings to photography. 
</P>
<P>
 The gallery will not be a mere variation of Pace Gallery in New York, he said. 
Many of the exhibitions will originate in Beverly Hills, he said. And more Los 
Angeles-based artists will be featured in the West Coast showcase. As to whom 
those artists might be, he said: "That isn't settled yet."

A VENICE BEACH VET IS PACKING UP HIS LAUGHS; COMEDY: HIS ACTING CAREER IS 
TAKING OFF, SO MICHAEL COLYAR WILL END NINE YEARS OF DOING STAND-UP ON THE 
BOARDWALK, CLIMAXING WITH A TWO-HOUR LABOR DAY PERFORMANCE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After nine years of getting Venice Beach audiences to give it up for his comic 
performances, Michael Colyar is himself giving it up. 
</P>
<P>
 Colyar, whose often blue but always topical stand-up routines beachside have 
inspired both enmity and adulation -- and won him some choice acting gigs -- 
will present his last regular performances this weekend from noon to 5 p.m. ("I 
work up to 5 o'clock because at 5 o'clock, all the white people leave and they 
take their money," he jokes.) 
</P>
<P>
 The weekend will be climaxed by a two-hour Labor Day farewell performance 
Monday at 2 p.m., which promises special guests and brand-new material. 
</P>
<P>
 "I came (to Los Angeles) to act," Colyar says. But, his al fresco gig "got so 
lucrative that here it is, nine years later, and I'm still locked into the 
comedy." 
</P>
<P>
 Now with his acting career taking off -- he has appeared in 11 films and 
numerous sitcoms -- the cash with which tourists favor him are but gravy, 
though accountants have advised him not to say how much he makes per weekend.  
</P>
<P>
 Still, his near-weekly Venice Beach appearances provided a distraction to his 
acting career. "The reason I don't think I've taken off the way I should take 
off is that I've concentrated so much on comedy that there hasn't been enough 
time to dedicate to my craft," he says. "And so it's time to wrap it up and do 
what I came to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Not that getting tourists to yuk it up hasn't paid off. Robert Townsend gave 
him his first role, one line, in "Hollywood Shuffle" after catching his act on 
his regular spot on the boardwalk, where Clubhouse Avenue (which, in reality, 
is more an alley than an avenue) abuts the ocean. 
</P>
<P>
 Subsequent films have included "House Party 3" and "Hot Shots Part Deux" ("I 
played the black guy," he jokes), with his just completed effort, "Kangaroo 
Court," providing his first chance to really show off his dramatic chops. 
</P>
<P>
 "Kangaroo Court" is sort of a Rodney G. King revenge fantasy. Colyar plays a 
motorist brutalized by a white cop. The cop (defended by an attorney played by 
Gregory Hines) is in turn kidnaped by the black community and held to stand 
trial underground, in the realm of black jurists and a black judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the inflammatory nature of that film, Colyar has dedicated his comedy 
to healing the rifts between the races -- during his brief set this afternoon, 
he wears a baseball cap reading, "Eracism" -- and attacking societal ills, from 
drug abuse to AIDS. Clean for more than five years, Colyar does material about 
his days as a crack addict, so messed up he staked out his own home and tried 
to steal his own TV to pawn. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Colyar's act initially met with resistance from the neighborhood 
because of his use of profanity, his dedication to that same neighborhood and 
the cause of homelessness has resulted in the City of Venice planning to give 
him a special award at Monday's program. When Colyar won $100,000 on "Star 
Search," he dedicated half the money to the city's homeless shelters, and he 
inaugurated a yearly program to collect food for the homeless during his 
December performances (he plans to return to Venice for a series of shows this 
December). Colyar is also preparing a non-profane version of his show, which 
will present his message for schoolchildren.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Because of the passion Colyar feels for his causes, an interview with him on 
the boardwalk comes off more as a series of pronouncements than actual 
conversation. When he states, "Instead of trying to make a living, I live my 
making," he's doing material that appeared in profiles three years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 But this doesn't diffuse his sincerity. Throughout the interview, Colyar stops 
to invite passersby -- all friends and acquaintances, from cops to surfers -- 
to his final show. And he's frequently interrupted by fans, who have seen him 
either on "Star Search" or in "House Party 3" or on one of his other 
appearances, who tell him how much they appreciate his act. In return, he is 
unfailingly gracious and appreciative. 
</P>
<P>
 It wasn't that long ago that Colyar was a struggling artist on the streets of 
Chicago. Friends introduced him to the concept of street performance -- "I 
thought, what a lowdown thing to do, stand around begging for money" -- and 
then, on his fourth day, he garnered $84 for four hours' work. "I said, 'I 
could try this,' " he recalls with a smile. 
</P>
<P>
 He soon left the winters of Chicago for the eternal sun of Venice Beach, and 
was making enough to support himself and his son (he has since remarried).  
</P>
<P>
 His stature as "the only comedian who does drive-by comedy" has made him both 
beloved and the target of attacks on the boardwalk, Colyar says. He has a 
stalker who once hired a plane to fly over the beach with a quixotic message to 
him, he reports, and, has been confronted by other surly, even potentially 
dangerous, observers. 
</P>
<P>
 "So many people have seen me on so many TV shows, they know the comedy I do," 
he says. "So they try to challenge me. Then they find out that they can't win. 
They have two or three funny things to say, and I have about 400 funny things 
to say about them. So they dig a hole they can't get out of and their egos are 
hurt, and they get upset and they threaten me and stuff. I don't need that. I 
came here to have fun." 
</P>
<P>
 One audience member even drew a knife on him, Colyar recalls. "I picked up the 
chair I stand on and charged him and pushed him out of the crowd," he says, 
adding that policemen happened to be nearby to make the arrest. 
</P>
<P>
 Nonetheless, Colyar will miss being part of the funkiness that has 
historically defined Venice Beach. "I started missing it from the moment we 
made the decision," he says. "There isn't anything like Venice Beach. There's 
always some craziness going on. It's wonderful, sometimes it's dangerous, but 
it's always spontaneous. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "There's a guy who bills himself as the World's Greatest Wino. He doesn't care 
if you give him a quarter or two, he tells you, 'I want to get a taste.' Yet 
he's still a remarkable cat. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are phenomenal things out here, and there's nonsense out here," he 
concludes. "Beyond that, there's the beauty and the essence of God. You stand 
here and look at the ocean, you look at the sunset. It's the most incredible 
thing."

OUT OF THE TV NEWSROOM CLOSET; KNBC'S GARRETT GLASER BREAKS GROUND AS AN OPENLY 
GAY ON-AIR REPORTER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JOSEPH HANANIA, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The most prominent fixture in Garrett Glaser's cubicle at KNBC-TV Channel 4 in 
Burbank is a 3-by-4-foot ACT UP poster proclaiming, "Hollywood, Quit Censoring 
Our Queer Lives!" Beneath are photos of him with celebrities he has 
interviewed, intermingled with photos of him with various (non-celebrity) 
boyfriends. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser, 41, Channel 4's media/ entertainment reporter, sits on the board of 
directors of the National Lesbian/Gay Journalists Assn. and, in his free time, 
hosts gay-themed shows for KCET-TV Channel 28, including its recent 
commemoration of the gay liberation movement's birth with the Stonewall riots 
25 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 While virtually all Southland TV newsrooms employ gay men and lesbians, 
Glaser's openness about his orientation and his willingness to fight for gay 
causes set him apart among on-air personnel.  
</P>
<P>
 In an article for the issue of Out magazine that will be available next week, 
CNBC medical correspondent Steve Gendel writes that while his co-workers knew 
he was gay when he worked at KNBC and KCBS-TV Channel 2 a few years ago, he hid 
it from viewers. Local gay activists say that's the norm. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser's presence, by contrast, marks "a dramatic breakthrough," Gay and 
Lesbian Community Services Center spokesman Sky Johnson said. "The dam has been 
broken. This is the beginning of the on-air recognition of the full gay 
community."  
</P>
<P>
 Lee Werbel, executive director for the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against 
Defamation, said Glaser's hiring last February was important because "it gives 
gays a visible role model. It tells gays and lesbians in the audience that what 
we see on television has something to do with us." 
</P>
<P>
 KNBC news director Mark Hoffman said he hired Glaser "not because of his 
sexual orientation, but because he is an excellent reporter." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, Hoffman said, "We understand that total objectivity is 
impossible, that everybody brings a life experience to every story they report. 
. . . I would like to think that (Glaser's) presence gives us more depth on the 
tube. In the newsroom, it gives us one more voice to sensitize people on gay 
issues." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Since his arrival, Glaser has pressed the station to increase both the 
quantity and quality of its coverage of gay issues. Recent stories he has 
initiated include a feature on the high-brow gay magazine, Urban Fitness, and a 
feature on how mainstream advertisers are increasingly targeting their products 
to the gay market. 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser has also pushed for increased gay visibility in the newsroom and on the 
air. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't care if a reporter is covering city politics or sports. He's a role 
model. And it's important that the 10-year-old watching at home knows that some 
of the reporters he sees are gay. He needs to see the reporter doing his job 
well, and to know that the stereotype for gays and lesbians is most often 
false. 
</P>
<P>
 "Gays are still an invisible minority. The sooner we stand up and are counted, 
the faster the fight will go in our favor." 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser "came out" as a junior at New York City's Dalton School in 1969. "I 
remember, even in high school, saying that I would not go into the closet. I 
saw the toll that took on people, the self-torture, the frequent resort to 
alcohol and drug abuse," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 "I saw gay people get married and have kids because they thought they had to. 
I saw others who didn't live up to their potential because they thought they 
didn't deserve it. I wanted no part of that; I wanted to be proud of myself."  
</P>
<P>
 As an openly gay man, Glaser worked at WABC-TV in New York and for the 
syndicated magazine show "Entertainment Tonight." He has also done stints in 
Miami; Norfolk, Va.; Detroit and Ft. Wayne, Ind. Throughout the years, he 
witnessed newsroom homophobia, and had one network correspondent confide to 
him, "I already lost one job by coming out. I'm not going to lose another." 
</P>
<P>
 Glaser doesn't buy the argument that "closeted" gays can provide the input to 
properly cover the gay community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The danger of closeted employees is that they are so fearful of disclosing 
their orientation, they stifle legitimate stories on the community," he said. 
"They no longer use their journalistic skills to dig up good stories. Instead, 
their first priority is to cover up -- and so they throw their training out the 
window. It's insane." 
</P>
<P>
 Hank Plante, an openly gay reporter and anchor at CBS' San Francisco 
affiliate, KPIX-TV, agrees that television news is frequently homophobic. 
</P>
<P>
 "TV news is run by straight white males with no direct experience with the gay 
and lesbian communities," he said. ". . . If there is a gay pride parade, and 
out of 100,000 marchers there are three drag queens, I could guarantee what 
shot they would take. TV goes for the cheap shots." 
</P>
<P>
 Plante insisted that his openness about his orientation has aided him in 
breaking many stories, including that of the first openly gay Catholic priest 
with AIDS and the first documented case of AIDS transmission through oral sex. 
His sources within the gay community trusted him "as a man whose interest in 
the community is heightened because I'm one of them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Plante attributed the scarcity of openly gay reporters to many television news 
executives "perceiving more discrimination than actually exists. They think 
that society thinks a certain way on this, and cover the news accordingly. The 
lack of coverage, in turn, helps reinforce their perceptions, becoming a 
self-fulfilling prophecy." 
</P>
<P>
 Even at KNBC, Glaser has only been allowed to hint at his orientation on air 
by using the word us instead of them when covering the gay community. 
Nevertheless, news director Hoffman said that he has green-lighted Glaser's 
on-air coming out as part of a "relevant report on the gay community," which he 
and Glaser are discussing for the November ratings sweeps. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've seen many surveys showing that the gay community is very loyal to brands 
that reach out to the gay media. They remember who was there first," Glaser 
said. "Similarly, they'll remember us. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 "If we succeed, a lot of people will know that, to get the insider story on 
the gay community, tune in to Channel 4. I'm just amazed that the other 
stations are still waiting on the sidelines on this. It makes our beating them 
to the punch almost too easy."

A NEW EFFORT UNDER WAY TO DEFINE VIOLENCE ON TV; STUDIES: TWO PROJECTS WILL 
LOOK AT ALL PROGRAMMING EXCEPT NEWS. THEIR FINDINGS MAY INFLUENCE FUTURE 
REGULATION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CERONE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 As the fall season unfurls over the next few weeks, banks of newly installed 
videotape machines located in university halls will be quietly taping almost 
everything TV has to offer. 
</P>
<P>
 In the coming months, college students in Los Angeles, Santa Barbara and 
Austin, Tex., will be paid to pore over those videotapes and check them twice, 
marking down everything that's naughty and nice. 
</P>
<P>
 Specifically, they will be looking for acts of violence. Future regulation of 
the TV industry may be determined by what they find. 
</P>
<P>
 These students and the experienced researchers in charge of them are the 
nation's new violence monitors. They will be working for two separate nonprofit 
organizations, Studio City-based Mediascope and the UCLA Center for 
Communication Policy, that have been retained by the TV industry to define 
violence and tally the amount of it on the tube over the next three years. 
</P>
<P>
 The studies were commissioned in response to a challenge -- or threat, 
depending on your perspective -- issued last year by Sen. Paul Simon (D-Ill.), 
who has been spearheading a move in Congress to reduce TV mayhem. He called for 
the formation of an independent "advisory office" to devise a uniform set of 
standards for TV violence, then act as a strict monitor to let the public know 
just how well the industry meets those standards. 
</P>
<P>
 If Simon's proposal was heeded, he vowed, he would do his best to keep the 
hounds at bay in Congress. If the TV industry did not cooperate, Simon said, he 
would let the lawmakers loose on Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I want is to keep pressure on -- but to keep pressure on not from the 
government, but from the public, if you will," Simon said in a recent phone 
interview. "I want to make sure that what we're going through really is an 
evolutionary process that will continue in a constructive direction, and not 
wind up as a bone tossed out to those of us in government who are concerned, 
before they (television executives) go back to their old ways." 
</P>
<P>
 The broadcast and cable TV industries could have satisfied Simon by choosing a 
single monitor. But broadcast and cable executives have been adversaries for 
years, and each selected its own independent monitor. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Cable Television Assn. will pay $3.3 million for the three-year 
study to Mediascope, a nonprofit organization created in 1992 with the mission 
of helping Hollywood present violence in a more socially responsible way. 
Mediascope will work with the universities of California at Santa Barbara, 
Texas at Austin, Wisconsin at Madigan and North Carolina at Chapel Hill to 
coordinate a study of a composite week of TV programming from early morning 
through late night. 
</P>
<P>
 ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox, meanwhile, together will pay $500,000 a year to the 
UCLA Center for Communication Policy, which was formed last year to address the 
rapidly changing communications developments that are transforming society. The 
center will focus primarily on prime-time and children's programming, examining 
specific programs and time slots several times over the course of each season. 
</P>
<P>
 Both studies will include broadcast and cable programming to capture a full 
picture of the landscape. Both will define media violence and then analyze the 
context in which violence occurs in TV programs -- taking into account such 
factors as whether the violent act is rewarded, how graphically the violence is 
portrayed and whether children are likely to be watching. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "We know that if a very young child sees a violent act take place, and they 
see no negative consequence of that act, that child will see that the violent 
act was rewarded," Mediascope President Marcy Kelly said. "Now, if you see a 
violent act in the beginning of a two-hour movie and it was not punished for 
two hours, a very young child does not see the consequences. Clearly there are 
stories perfectly appropriate for an adult, but if you're marketing the same 
story for a 5-year-old, that becomes a problem." 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Cole, director of the UCLA center, said his group is also operating on 
the assumption that "violence itself is not necessarily evil. It depends on how 
it is used." 
</P>
<P>
 "Most studies simply count violent acts," he said, "and all acts are lumped 
together with nothing to distinguish either the context in which the violence 
occurs or whether the violence is appropriate or justified. Under that system, 
a pinch is fairly equated with a decapitation." 
</P>
<P>
 According to one study, Cole continued, "the most violent show on television 
last year was a 'Laugh-In' retrospective. The problem with those systems, if 
you are a network and you want to be responsible, (is that) you have to remove 
the violence without considering the context or plot. There would be nothing to 
distinguish between the violence in 'The Lion King' and 'I Spit on Your Grave.' 
" 
</P>
<P>
 The first findings of the two studies will be published next year and will be 
available to the public. 
</P>
<P>
 In both the monitoring efforts, the first line of screeners will be college 
students. They are now being trained to identify problematic programming -- in 
Los Angeles for the UCLA study, and in Santa Barbara and Austin for Mediascope. 
</P>
<P>
 Based on the definition of TV violence that Cole is still working on, the 
students at UCLA will rate what they watch one of three ways: needs no review 
by supervisors, may need review or definitely needs review. 
</P>
<P>
 "Students can't independently declare programming problematic," said Cole, who 
has taught communications at UCLA for 19 years. "Anything that needs review 
will be brought to a larger meeting of the senior staff." 
</P>
<P>
 Beginning with the taping of the new Fox lineup Sunday night, the UCLA team 
will review virtually every program that airs in prime time on the four 
broadcast networks -- made-for-TV movies, theatrical movies, comedy and drama 
series -- and TV programs directed at children throughout the day. Each 
regularly scheduled program will be looked at a minimum of four times. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 UCLA will also examine advertising and promotional spots on the networks; some 
critics complain that TV commercials for violent movies playing in theaters are 
worse than any programs produced specifically for television. There will also 
be a two-week-sample study of programming for public broadcasting, prime-time 
syndication and the cable networks, and also of the top 10 video rental titles 
for each quarter and the top five video games each year. News programming will 
be excluded. 
</P>
<P>
 In some ways, the Mediascope study will be even larger -- an exhaustive 
analysis of 25 cable and broadcast channels from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m., or more 
than 2,700 hours total of programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is look at a week in the life of television," 
Mediascope's Kelly said, although it won't be a week in the calendar sense but 
rather a composite of programs taken from different times during the season. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to a thorough content analysis of programming that will focus on 
violence in its complete context, an array of other studies will be conducted 
at the four participating universities. These will examine how viewers 
understand, interpret and respond to violence advisories and ratings systems. 
They will analyze the effectiveness of violence prevention efforts, educational 
activities and public-service announcements. They will look at the TV 
industry's scheduling practices. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike the UCLA effort, the Mediascope study will include representatives of 
the entertainment industry in the research and design stage. Researchers have 
been working all summer to develop a coding scheme to create definitions for 
different categories of violence. Next weekend, the researchers will meet with 
TV executives and producers at the University of Texas in Austin to present 
their preliminary designs and get feedback. Five more meetings are being 
scheduled for Los Angeles to focus on separate program forms such as children's 
animation and dramatic programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want their voices to be heard, so the final product does not just reflect 
an academic point of view but also reflects the entertainment industry," Kelly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Martin Franks, CBS senior vice president and spokesman for the broadcast 
networks on the violence issue, said he and his peers looked over Mediascope's 
proposal and were impressed by it but that they simply liked UCLA's better.  
</P>
<P>
 "We just wanted to do something different," Franks said. "Who's to say two 
voices aren't better than one? We think we may learn from theirs, and they may 
learn from ours." 
</P>
<P>
 "I wish there was just one monitoring group. Then we'd have some uniform 
standards to use for evaluating all of this programming," said Rep. Edward J. 
Markey (D-Mass.), chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee of the House 
Energy and Commerce Committee. Markey is still pushing for his own solution to 
TV violence in the form of a "V chip" inside the TV set that would filter out 
troublesome programming. 
</P>
<P>
 "Two monitoring groups could result in confusion for parents, because there 
will be different reports coming from different sources simultaneously," he 
said. "Our highest priority should be to give simple information to parents, so 
they can protect their children."

MIDLER BRINGS ZEST, FEELING OF SPONTANEITY TO 'DIVINE' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a concert season of tailored star vehicles, Bette Midler's production, 
"Experience the Divine," stands out for its sense of spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 At the Irvine Meadows Amphitheatre on Thursday, "Divine" was just as scripted 
and well-rehearsed as Barbra Streisand's seamless, self-celebratory ritual or 
Janet Jackson's flashy, contrived entertainment for the MTV generation.It was 
essentially the same package Midler brought around last year when she returned 
to concerts for the first time in more than a decade, including such favorite 
past routines as the wheelchair-bound mermaids and her re-creation of Sophie 
Tucker's bawdy burlesque comedy. 
</P>
<P>
 But this was less a piece of '90s entertainment machinery than a throwback to 
vaudeville -- a more immediate, less distancing brand of performance. Midler's 
act made imbalance and jarring juxtaposition the rule, and gave the impression 
that anything at all might pop out at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellingly, Midler did not employ the video screens used nowadays by most other 
big-ticket acts, but placed justified confidence in her ability to project a 
personality big enough to reach the lawn. Despite its delightful bits, the 
mermaid routine went on far too long, and some of Midler's ballads were either 
tossed off or harshly belted. But the show's overall zestfulness made it 
possible to forgive this vision of the Divine when it erred. 
</P>

8 p.m. $150, $75, $50, $30. (310) 419-3100 .

MARKEY PRESSING AHEAD FOR 'V-CHIP'; LEGISLATION: A TRADE GROUP IS CONSIDERING 
ENDORSING TECHNOLOGY THAT WOULD BLOCK VIOLENT PROGRAMMING, BUT NETWORKS ARE 
BALKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Although most on Capitol Hill are willing to see how the new violence monitors 
work, Rep. Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.) is pressing ahead with legislation that 
would require manufacturers to install a "V-chip" in every television set, 
enabling viewers to block out violent programming. 
</P>
<P>
 Markey, chairman of the telecommunications subcommittee of the House Energy 
and Commerce Committee, author of the law requiring that all TV sets 
manufactured after July, 1993, be equipped to receive closed-caption broadcasts 
for hearing-impaired people, now wants to see the same technology used to 
produce TV receivers that can recognize and respond to program content ratings. 
</P>
<P>
 "The pattern, beginning in the 1950s, is that the broadcasters begin to push 
the limits of what is acceptable to the public; Congress reacts to the public 
concern about the level of violence, and then the industry reduces violence for 
a season or two," Markey said. "That's beginning to happen again. But we need 
to break this cycle. We need to give the parent the tools to protect their 
children, no matter where the industry is in the cycle." 
</P>
<P>
 A key subcommittee of the Electronic Industries Assn. voted at a meeting in 
Chicago last July to endorse the blocking technology, despite vigorous 
opposition from the broadcast networks. The issue will go up for vote again in 
October before the full engineering committee. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the Electronic Industries Assn. agrees to do this voluntarily, there will 
be no legislation," Markey said. 
</P>
<P>
 The only hitch is that for the V-chip to do any good, the broadcast and cable 
TV industry must join the movement and transmit their programming with a 
special code to flag violent programs so the V-chip can filter them out. 
</P>
<P>
 At this point, Markey is asking TV executives to "voluntarily" agree to encode 
their violent programming. They already include on-air advisories about violent 
programs, he notes: "All I'm asking is that they send the advisories 
electronically." 
</P>
<P>
 The cable networks have announced that they will support the V-chip technology 
if their broadcast brethren do. And therein lies the rub. The broadcast 
networks say they will not comply. They gave in and agreed to fund the violence 
monitoring for three years but won't give ground in this instance, insists 
Martin Franks, a CBS senior vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do oppose a chip that, for example, will block out 'Texas Chainsaw 
Massacre' but will also block out 'Lonesome Dove,' " Franks said. "The V-chip 
has a bit of an autopilot aspect we find very troubling. 
</P>
<P>
 "To say nothing of the fact that we think it's the first step on a very 
slippery slope to censorship. Yeah, I know it's voluntary . And yet the same 
people who are so loudly claiming it's voluntary are in a position to take it 
out on us if we don't comply."

TRENDS; THE AWNING OF A SHADY, NEW AGE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JANET KINOSIAN, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Now that few people want to sit out in the noonday sun, and tans areneither 
healthy nor fashionable, shade is chic. And awnings, in beautiful materials 
molded over windows and patios and in all shapes and sizes and designs, have it 
made in the shade. 
</P>
<P>
 New fabrics, new construction designs, new gadgetry -- such as the 
self-retractable awning that automatically rolls up when the weather is foul 
and rolls out again when the sun shines -- are expanding the awning market in 
new directions. 
</P>
<P>
 "The two primary things awnings can do for your home are reduce heat 
significantly and help block out the ultraviolet rays so curtains, furniture 
and carpets will not fade and be damaged," says Andy Stack of Accent 
Industries, a residential and commercial awning company in Santa Ana. "In 
Europe, energy costs are so much higher, and thus awnings are extremely 
popular. Here, people don't think about it quite as much. But more and more 
awnings are going up here in Orange County, and people seem to be very pleased 
with their choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Stack says that awnings can block out a whopping 82% of all ultraviolet rays 
and approximately 82% of the heat (if all windows are covered). "It's the 
difference between leaving your car in the shade under a tree or in the sun," 
he said. "With awnings, you're effectively putting your house in the shade." 
</P>
<P>
 J. Miller Canvas in Costa Mesa installs both commercial and residential 
awnings, and owner Jim Miller says he's seen a great increase in awnings 
popularity in Orange County in the past five years. 
</P>
<P>
 "First up, it's a great way to add a whole new color to your house without the 
expense and difficulties of a paint job." He notes that the life-span of a 
typical awning is about eight to 10 years and says color changes for the home 
are perfect at the decade mark.  
</P>
<P>
 "The traditional Pacific blue is still a strong color," he says, "but in the 
last two to three years, the neutral colors have really taken off."  
</P>
<P>
 He says that beiges and natural cotton colors are extremely popular. "We've 
even done black and the Moroccan white, though we do discourage pure white 
because of its inclination to get dirty rather quickly." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's home is painted white and has solid black awnings -- both frames and 
canvas. "It's quite dramatic and looks great," he says. "People comment on it 
all the time." 
</P>
<P>
 Among the places awnings are being used is above French doors, because they 
protect the wood from the damage of intense sunlight without blocking the view. 
</P>
<P>
 Architects and designers are beginning to look more favorably at awnings for 
their potential for adding structural color and distinction as well as weather 
protection. One example is the Irvine Company's Villa Point condominium project 
in Newport Beach. After the design was completed, it went back to the boards 
and forest green awnings were added, altering and enhancing the look of the 
project. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Upkeep of awnings is fairly simple -- like boat coverings, they just need a 
good hosing down or water wash job every so often. 
</P>
<P>
 Where you live -- on a busy street with heavy traffic, near the airport or out 
by the ocean -- will determine how often and in what way you'll need to clean 
them. Awning makers advise against using soap because residue can cause fabric 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
 New welding techniques along with a new power-paint process (whereby the paint 
is baked onto the fabric) make for stronger and longer-lasting awnings.  
</P>
<P>
 "Fabrics don't fade like they used to," Miller says. "It's not unusual for the 
threads to actually go before the color fades." He says most awnings come with 
a non-fade five-year guarantee but that most last much longer. 
</P>
<P>
 There are numerous styles of awnings, from the traditional gable frame to the 
bow or hipped frame. Awning companies help guide and direct buyers to the 
styles best suited for their homes.  
</P>
<P>
 There are many variations -- some modern and some timeless. 
</P>
<P>
 "We did an old awning style recently, a reverse curve where the support comes 
with the old metal spears, and the results were great," Miller said. "Style, 
color, fabric and placement, these are the keys to a good result with your 
awnings." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Eight primary generic fabrics are used in today's awning market -- painted 
Army duck, vinyl-coated cotton, vinyl-laminated polyester, vinyl-coated 
poly-cotton blend and solution-dyed modacrylic.  
</P>
<P>
 The fabrics come in stripes, solids and patterns; surfaces can be matte, 
smooth or woven; transparency ranges from opaque to translucent. 
</P>
<P>
 While there are scores of designer colors to choose from, Stack sees the most 
popular colors being beiges, forest green, Pacific blue, and -- the newest -- 
aqua. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in the century, canvas awnings were simple, utilitarian affairs, 
typically cotton sailcloth nailed to a wooden frame. 
</P>
<P>
 By the late 1800s, awning hardware was developing quickly, and instead of 
nailing cloth to the frames, fabric was laced on, permitting a better fit and 
look. 
</P>
<P>
 Fabric was taking a new spin, as well. The traditional pearl gray boat duck 
could be painted different colors. Painted duck is still available today and is 
known by its pearl gray back color, due to mineral-dyeing. 
</P>
<P>
 This availability of colors was the springboard for more architectural uses of 
awnings; they were no longer mere shade devices, but contributed to the look 
and style of a house. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The retractable awning -- a 1920s American innovation -- was transplanted to 
Europe, where retractable awnings are now the largest segment of the market and 
are known as the American or California-style awnings. 
</P>
<P>
 They were reintroduced to the U.S. market more than a decade ago, and they are 
now known as the European-style retractable awnings. 
</P>
<P>
 In retractable awnings, prices vary according to hardware involved, Stack 
said. A crank awning covering a 12-by-8-foot area starts at about $1,150; a 
same-size motorized awning with a three-way switch that can be stopped anywhere 
along the awning's path is about $1,550; a wind sensor awning that 
automatically brings the awning in when the wind kicks up can cost closer to 
$2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 While it is not inexpensive to install quality awnings, increased energy costs 
have made them more cost-effective compared to air conditioning.  
</P>
<P>
 "Europe, particularly the sun belt, knows well not only how fashionable, but 
how functional and also highly practical awnings are," Stack says. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems Americans here on the West Coast are beginning to catch on."

BEAUTY'S BY THE YARD; LAWN AND GARDEN ORNAMENTS ARE SPROUTING UP AGAIN COMPLETE 
WITH A '90S SENSIBILITY AND A TOUCH OF DESIGN WHIMSY. SOME ARE EVEN PRACTICAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Say the words yard art and you can almost hear property values plummet. For 
many, they connote cast-iron lawn jockeys and ceramic sombrero-wearers in a 
siesta pose, both terri bly passe and politically incorrect. 
</P>
<P>
 The decorated yard got a bad reputation when overzealous practitioners refused 
to stop with just one gewgaw and filled their landscapes with bunnies, burros 
and wishing wells. Excess gave the movement a bad name, and in the '60s these 
tchotchkes joined Elvis on velvet in the kitsch closet of the art world. 
</P>
<P>
 But if Pucci prints and boomerang-shaped tables can come around again, so can 
yard art. It's back in a '90s kind of culturally sensitive, environmentally 
considerate and, in some cases, quite whimsical way. 
</P>
<P>
 Landscape designers call this new incarnation the "garden ornament" (probably 
looks classier on the invoice), and they are using large, stately, often pricey 
pieces in yards. 
</P>
<P>
 And in the two- or three-figure realm, stores that specialize in garden 
supplies are dragging their decorative bird feeders, fountains and ceramic 
bovines up front, within sight of the cash registers. 
</P>
<P>
 At Roger's Gardens in Corona del Mar, customers are snapping up cement 
statuary in styles as tame as turtles and as racy as pickup trucks (a two-foot 
long replica of a '49 Chevy).  
</P>
<P>
 Jamie Platt, nursery manager and the person who orders such items at Roger's, 
says there is definitely a reborn interest in adding ornamentation to the yard 
and garden. Wind chimes, birdhouses, fountains, statuary and decorative pots 
(often in cement) are all being used to add a playful touch -- sometimes 
singly; sometimes en masse.  
</P>
<P>
 Garden art is being reintroduced because it adds drama, texture and color. It 
can be colossally extravagant or incredibly modest. It can be the focal point 
or a hidden treasure. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most notable aspects of higher-end yard art is its scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Landscape architect Mia Lehrer of Lehrer Architects and BLS Design in Los 
Angeles has decorated yards with urns that stand taller than an NBA forward and 
stone balls the size of weather balloons. "The sense of scale has changed a 
lot," she says. 
</P>
<P>
 In its grander versions, the new outdoor art is often combined with water and 
lighting to perform a dual function. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Pacific Palisades back yard of Charles Eglee and Ninkey Dalton, 
landscape architect Robert Steiner placed a ceramic pot pond-side and plumbed 
it for a fountain. Glazed a brilliant orange, the pot matches the slippery koi 
that circle beneath. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles architect Mark Rios of Rios Associates designed massive stone urns 
with portals of light for a Brentwood home. 
</P>
<P>
 Rios has also created outdoor furniture that borders on the sculptural, such 
as a long, undulating bright yellow bench for a large garden with a huge 
expanse of lawn. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of our product design came about because of deficiencies in the 
marketplace. Garden furniture was boring," says Rios, who is making more of the 
caterpillar benches to keep up with demand. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the custom-made pieces are more humble. For another client's vegetable 
garden, Rios created a bean pole shaped like an oil derrick. On top of the 
derrick twirls a metal carrot-shaped wind vane, and on top of the carrot is a 
spigot capable of watering the entire garden. 
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
 But such fanciful pieces are rare. Few, it seems, have the nerve to decorate 
their lawns with bowling balls instead of specimen plants, as record producer 
Allie Willis has done in Studio City. Or to turn their front yards into shrines 
to Snow White, as Robert Cohen, a senior vice president of Paramount Pictures, 
has done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Snow White, of course, represents the eventual and inevitable triumph of love 
over evil, always so important an object lesson to hold onto when dealing with 
Hollywood agents," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 One proponent of the nothing-is-sacred approach is Jay Griffith. The yard 
surrounding his Venice landscape design office is littered with treasures just 
waiting for the right home. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a roiling, boiling cesspool of garden ornament," Griffith says proudly 
of his collection. Among the prized possessions is a three-dimensional gold 
arrow the size of a subcompact car and a shed-sized Aladdin's lamp from a movie 
theater. Both are wired for lights -- again, dual-purpose yard art. 
</P>
<P>
 For his own garden, Griffith is creating a life-size rendition of the Mad 
Hatter's tea party. In a neighbor's back yard, Griffith fashioned a 
20-foot-tall stage. Iron beams support curtains made of pleated wire netting 
with a swag of brass screen. Bougainvillea climbs the wings. Rolling around the 
lawn is a disco mirror ball. And off to the east, in a shady corner of the palm 
court, is a treasure chest that hints of a pirate's plunder. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 For yard-art enthusiasts who prefer to do their own decorating, contemporary 
versions of classic garden ornaments can be had at some garden, pottery and 
retail stores. 
</P>
<P>
 Or, if you use your imagination, you may find the right yard art at garage 
sales, flea markets or other unconventional outlets. 
</P>
<P>
 Who knows, in a few years, today's oversized ornaments may join Elvis 
paintings in the closet. But for now, they are having a glorious moment in the 
sun.

A HELPING HAND: INSIDE & OUT; COMPLETE A ROUGH JOB WITH LESS MESS 
</P>

 Q. Like a lot of people, I want to get rid of the acoustic, cottage cheese 
ceilings in my house. I know it should be easy to scrape off, but I'm wondering 
if I'll have to apply a drywall mud afterward to finish it. 
</P>
<P>
 B.K., Anaheim 
</P>
<P>
 A. You may not be approaching this problem the right way, says Pete Gorman of 
Rancho Lumber in Westminster. The first thing you should consider is whether 
your ceiling has asbestos. Many homes have been made with asbestos ceilings 
over the years, and the only way to be sure is to have yours tested by an 
asbestos removal professional. If it does, once you tear into the ceiling, the 
fine asbestos particles get everywhere. Even if you don't have asbestos, 
scraping a ceiling really creates a mess. 
</P>
<P>
 A better solution may be to encase the acoustic ceiling by laying drywall 
directly on top of it. You can use a thin, 1/4-inch drywall, and you get your 
smooth ceiling with a lot less trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We're making plans to remodel our house, and we were thinking of encasing 
the outside of one of the fireplaces in an elaborate wood mantel. However, a 
friend told us that wood or other flammable materials had to be at least 18 
inches from a fireplace. Is that true? 
</P>
<P>
 J.I., Laguna Hills 
</P>
<P>
 A. There is a universal building code that dictates how close flammable 
materials should be to a fireplace, and some municipalities tighten those 
codes, says Chris Jank of the Hearthstone in Corona del Mar. 
</P>
<P>
 In Orange County, the rule is 12 inches from the top of the opening and eight 
inches on each side. Many people make their mantles 12 inches on the top and 
sides so that it looks balanced. You could also try setting the firebox 12 
inches into the wall. This would allow you to build the mantle around the 
opening. 
</P>
<P>
 It's best to probably check with your local building department to find out 
about particular restrictions on fireplaces, but whatever the rules, you should 
be able to find or come up with a design that you like and that meets the code. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. We're getting our exterior ready for painting. I've noticed that in several 
areas, the stucco has become powdery. Does this mean that water is getting 
underneath the wall? How should it be taken care of? 
</P>
<P>
 S.O., Lake Forest 
</P>
<P>
 A. It's not necessarily water damage, says Charlie Kaczoroski of Tustin Paint 
Mart. As stucco ages, it sometimes deteriorates and gets Lyme deposits on the 
outside of the stucco. Make sure the wall is clean; probably the best way to do 
that is to wash it with a high-powered water sprayer. 
</P>
<P>
 After it dries, you can apply a masonry surface conditioner that will fortify 
the stucco. It should also have some kind of alkali resistant properties that 
will keep the stucco from powdering. You should be able to paint directly over 
the conditioner after it dries. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I'm getting ready to repaint my bathroom. A metal-framed picture has left a 
rust stain on the wall. I know this will show through the new coat of paint; 
how can it be prepared to keep it hidden? 
</P>
<P>
 D.D., Yorba Linda 
</P>
<P>
 A. Your first step should be to sand the rusted area, says Andrew Carter of 
Sinclair Paint in Costa Mesa. It's not likely that rust has bled very deeply 
into the paint, but you should still do your best to sand off as much as you 
can. Apply an oil-based primer to the spotted areas, and that should keep it 
hidden. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. I'll be buying my first computer soon, and I was told that it's important 
to make sure the outlets in my house are grounded. How can I tell that? 
</P>
<P>
 A.S., Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 A. Most hardware stores carry an inexpensive tester that fits into the outlet 
like a plug, says Mike McCoy of Current Supply in Westminster. You insert it, 
and it will tell you whether the outlet is grounded and also if the polarity is 
correct. It's a handy tool to carry, especially when traveling and using a 
computer because you can check on unknown outlets before risking your equipment 
on them.

 From broken, chipped dishes, ceramist Julie Sanders is grinding out new 
patterns for her Cyclamen Studio line. 
</P>
<P>
 Believed to be one of the first to use post-consumer ceramics as a part of a 
new product, Sanders, a Los Angeles native now living in Berkeley, uses 
ground-up old plates with new pieces to make her re-eco dinnerware, which is 
white with a speckled finish. The dinnerware also is available with borders in 
royal, foliage, Chinese red, mango and natural colors. 
</P>
<P>
 When adding up the amount of product she has thrown away at her facility 
alone, Sanders was inspired to find a way to put the waste to use. 
</P>
<P>
 "I asked around to see if anyone knew how to use the old plates, but no one 
knew, so I decided to just go ahead and do it, and I did it," said Sanders, who 
started making re-eco dinnerware in May and made her first shipments nationwide 
to stores such as Henri Bendel's and Nordstrom in late July. Geary's in Beverly 
Hills also carries Sanders' lines. 
</P>
<P>
 Sanders has also worked out a deal with the Northern California Waste 
Management Board to use them as a source for materials. 
</P>
<P>
 Customers are encouraged to participate in Sanders' recycling program. She 
will give customers a 10% discount, on a piece for piece basis, for any 
unwanted dish they turn in. 
</P>
<P>
 Prices for the re-eco collection range from about $14 for a large mug to $56 
for a pitcher and $82 for a pasta bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call Cyclamen Studio at (510) 843-4691. Custom Cabinetry 
</P>
<P>
 OK, you have the big screen, the speakers, the receiver, the videotapes and no 
place to put them. You have the computer, the monitor, the printer, the fax 
machine and no place to set them up. Or you have the sewing machine, the layout 
table and no place to hang your bobbins. 
</P>
<P>
 What to do? 
</P>
<P>
 Jan and Bud Tucker's Sea Design Furniture of San Clemente can solve your 
problem. Custom entertainment, computer and sewing centers, made of pine and 
birch, are their specialty. 
</P>
<P>
 Using your ideas, and a few of their own, Sea Design can add crown and 
detailed moldings, lighting and solid maple doors to enhance and accent the 
pieces. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, they use European hinges, touch latches and pocket doors, and 
they can install child-proof locks, too. 
</P>
<P>
 "We can create the unit of your dreams for a very competitive price," said 
Tucker, who has been in the business for more than 12 years. "Our centers are 
made of wood, not particle board, so they are of better quality." 
</P>
<P>
 All of Sea Design's pieces are paint- or stain-ready. The company does not do 
such finish work but can assist you, if necessary. 
</P>
<P>
 The average custom unit ranges from $725 to $1,100 and is anywhere from five 
to 15 feet wide, five to 10 feet high and 16 1/2 to 35 inches deep. 
</P>
<P>
 A basic piece is available for $349. 
</P>
<P>
 For information, call (714) 498-9107 or visit the factory showroom at 1504 De 
La Estrella, G, in San Clemente. Cool Cover 
</P>
<P>
 Not that anyone needs an excuse to gather around the water cooler, but Richard 
Good's Tropicool cover is sure to spark conversation, especially with its 
brightly colored fish and reef motif. 
</P>
<P>
 Made of a durable, washable canvas, the cover slips over most five-gallon 
drinking water bottles and helps to protect the drinking water from sunlight, 
which could lead to algae growth. 
</P>
<P>
 Good came up with the idea during a scuba-diving vacation in Australia. 
</P>
<P>
 "My partner and I took about 400 pictures underwater of these really neat 
fish, and I wanted to take those pictures and use them for something," said 
Good, who recently left Chevron, where he worked as a financial tax planner for 
12 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Good, owner of WORLDesigns, which distributes the cover ($11.95 postpaid), is 
a longtime advocate of marine and wildlife preservation and will donate 20% of 
the profits from each sale to the Center for Marine Conservation, an 
organization dedicated to the protection of oceans. 
</P>
<P>
 To order, call (800) 822-4459 or mail to WORLDesigns, P.O. Box 3266, Walnut 
Creek, CA 94596.

GARDENING; SUPPLY-SIDE GASTRONOMICS OF PEST-EATERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

By ADRIENNE COOK, TIMES-POST NEWS SERVICE 
</P>

<P>
 In the thriving trade in killer insects, the catalogue descriptions always 
sound so good: 
</P>
<P>
 "One pound of ladybugs will wipe out aphids forever!" "The Green Berets of the 
insect world -- let praying mantises be your ally!" 
</P>
<P>
 Earthworms are gentler creatures, but no less useful. "A no-more-till garden 
with hard-working earthworms!" 
</P>
<P>
 The benefits of hosting assorted and abundant life forms in the garden have 
never been questioned. Indeed, diversity of plant and animal life is the 
essence of environmentally correct gardening. The idea is that such variety 
creates a balanced, self-sustaining back yard that is easy to take care of and 
always beautiful. 
</P>
<P>
 To achieve this, however, do we really need to import bugs and other garden 
guests to do what they would naturally do if they already lived there in 
sufficient numbers? 
</P>
<P>
 I think not. If beneficial insects and earthworms are not abundant in your 
garden, or are not there at all, importing them will not fix your ecological 
imbalance. 
</P>
<P>
 The gardening world is not immune to the flimflam of society at large. A 
common, if specious, argument is that if one ladybug will devour 600 aphids in 
a week, then a dozen will consume 12 times that number and, therefore, you 
should have a dozen of them in your garden. 
</P>
<P>
 After watching a praying mantis slowly savor a fat cabbage-moth caterpillar, 
which in turn has been enjoying your broccoli more than you have, the immediate 
urge is to try to multiply that effect by fostering the mantis population. 
</P>
<P>
 And what about those hard-working earthworms? They too are valuable friends in 
the garden. One study at the National Soil Tilth Lab in Ames, Iowa, 
demonstrated that in farm fields rich in worm populations, irrigation runoff 
was virtually nonexistent: Two inches of water was absorbed in 12 minutes, 
contrasted with 12 hours for the same two inches in soils with low earthworm 
populations. No runoff, better water absorption, less erosion -- all of these 
benefits are laid at the altar of earthworms. 
</P>
<P>
 So if you want a better garden, shouldn't you invest in a major way in 
earthworms? Or would that be a waste of money better spent on plants? 
</P>
<P>
 The real rub, I think, is that although the value of earthworms and beneficial 
insects has never been challenged, what is rarely demonstrated is the link 
between bringing them in and reducing a garden's pest populations. 
</P>
<P>
 The issue of the soldier beetle is a case in point. A couple of years ago, the 
U.S. Department of Agriculture announced that an entomologist had designed a 
lure that would allow home gardeners to entice vast populations of these 
insect-eating beetles to their own back yards. The beetles are particularly 
tireless predatory insects that consume a veritable smorgasbord of garden 
pests. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turned out, the project was being driven by a belief -- untested by 
field studies -- that hordes of soldier beetles would bring about great pest 
carnage. 
</P>
<P>
 The logic is that if a few do a good job, a lot must do a great job. But in 
certain cases the evidence seems to lean the other way. Ladybugs, for example, 
will just pack up and leave town if there are no bad bugs to eat. You can 
import them all you want, but they won't hang around unless you've got aphids. 
(Conversely, they can smell a good meal from some distance, and will descend on 
your garden if aphids become a problem.) 
</P>
<P>
 Praying mantises eat each other if they're too numerous in one place and have 
no other prey. 
</P>
<P>
 Earthworms curl up and die if their soil lacks the organic nutrients to 
support them, or if the soil contains a lot of synthetic material such as 
fertilizers or pesticides. 
</P>
<P>
 The key to attracting -- and keeping -- beneficial insects is to create the 
proper environment for them. Earthworms will luxuriate in organically rich soil 
that is free of chemical additives. Rather than buying boxes of diligent night 
crawlers from catalogues, add leaves, compost and organic fertilizers to your 
garden soil: The worms will come. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep praying mantises, soldier beetles and ladybugs on the prowl, avoid 
using pesticides of any kind -- don't kill the bad guys and you won't kill the 
good guys that kill the bad guys. 
</P>
<P>
 To attract some of these predators and keep them around during the slow times 
between pest infestations, plant lots of flowers, especially those with flat, 
open faces that are easy for beetles to sup from. 
</P>
<P>
 And if you decide to invest in predatory insects, ask for documentation that 
shows they actually reduce plant damage when imported in large numbers. If you 
can't get the data, don't get the bugs.

DRESSING UP THE YARD ON A BUDGET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GAILE ROBINSON

<TEXT>
<P>
 Landscape designers offer some suggestions to gardeners who want to dabble in 
ornamentation without making a big financial commitment. 
</P>
<P>
 * Broken statuary -- such as earthquake damaged pieces -- can be used to great 
effect as a back-yard ruin, says Robert Steiner of the Venice firm Griffith and 
Steiner. 
</P>
<P>
 He also takes square chunks of recycled concrete and piles them in a tower to 
support large vases and statuary. Concrete blocks can also be stacked to make 
supporting columns. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not expensive to cut concrete, and you'd be amazed at the great things 
you can make with a pedestal and a pot if you elevate it above the bed." 
</P>
<P>
 * Cut corners on the "hardscaping" -- driveways, walkways, terraces -- 
suggests Mark Rios. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hardscaping is expensive. You can spend anywhere from $4 to $20 a square 
foot, depending on if it's concrete or some nice stone," he says. 
</P>
<P>
 "We do a lot of gravel. It's really cheap. Has a nice crunchy sound. It 
accepts litter for a nice mottled effect. You can drive on it. It's softer and 
better for the environment; water goes through it. We've done a lot of gravel 
gardens." 
</P>
<P>
 * Stone balls and large pots offer the scale of sculpture without the price, 
says Mia Lehrer. She also likes to scour resale shops and flea markets for such 
affordable garden ornaments as old birdhouses and birdbaths. GAILE ROBINSON

PLANTS; INDOORS OR OUT, THERE IS A BUNCH OF USES FOR BRIGHT SUNFLOWERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 There's nothing like bright yellow sunflowers to put a smile on your face -- 
whether you have them growing in your garden or are bringing them indoors. 
</P>
<P>
 When using sunflowers fresh or for drying, harvest them in midmorning when the 
blooms are almost completely open and the sun has burned off the morning dew. 
Cut the stems long. 
</P>
<P>
 As soon as possible, plunge the stems into a deep bucket of warm water and 
move them to a cold storage area -- a cool cellar or garage will work. 
</P>
<P>
 Store the flowers until you arrange them that evening or the next morning. 
</P>
<P>
 If you plan to dry the flowers, start processing them as soon as possible. To 
dry with the stems intact, hang individual flowers (not bunches) upside down. 
</P>
<P>
 Hanging them in this manner produces a twisted and tattered look that crafters 
desire in some design work. To dry just the flower head and one-half inch of 
stem, desiccant drying is recommended. 
</P>
<P>
 Because moisture causes premature fading, protect dried flowers from high 
humidity. If you don't plan to arrange your dried sunflowers right away, put 
them in a sealed plastic container (do not use cardboard) and store them in a 
cool, dry room away from light. 
</P>
<P>
 The sunflower's name comes from two Greek nouns -- helios, the sun, and 
anthus, flowers. Though we recognize the annual varieties, many flower-garden 
varieties grow in a range of colors as smaller-flowered branching perennials. 
</P>
<P>
 The familiar giant sunflower reigns as the Kansas state flower, but some 
farmers still consider all sunflowers weeds. 
</P>
<P>
 It would be hard to find a more versatile plant. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunflowers have economic as well as ornamental value. When cultivated as a 
cash crop, its leaves feed livestock, the flowers produce a yellow dye, pressed 
seeds yield cooking oil and dried seeds become tasty nut-like snacks for humans 
and birds. 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly two-thirds of the approximately 60 species of sunflowers worldwide grow 
in in the United States and in southern Canada as native plants. 
</P>
<P>
 As its name implies, the sunflower grows best in spots where it receives eight 
or more hours of sunlight per day. All relatively tall, these annuals and 
perennials range from three to 12 feet in height. 
</P>
<P>
 Sunflowers prefer moist soil but when mature will tolerate drought.

DO-IT-YOURSELF: OHMMETER DOES 3 VITAL TESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 You can test and trouble-shoot electrical appliances like a pro -- safely and 
easily -- using an ohmmeter. 
</P>
<P>
 An ohmmeter can test virtually every single electrical component in any 
appliance -- small and major. This includes all power cords, switches, 
solenoids, relays, timers, thermostats and heating elements, to name just a 
few. 
</P>
<P>
 By simply placing the meter's probes on the component's wires or terminals, 
you can determine quickly and safely if the part is defective. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the typical tests that you can perform include checking the 
water-level switch on a clothes washer, testing a thermostat of a refrigerator 
or freezer and checking the heating element of a clothes dryer, electric range 
or oven. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner's manual, which comes with each meter, provides more specific 
examples and instructions. 
</P>
<P>
 And, if you're concerned about receiving an electrical shock, don't be. When 
using an ohmmeter, double check to make sure the appliance is unplugged from 
the electrical outlet. 
</P>
<P>
 An ohmmeter can perform three vital electrical tests. One is to determine if a 
continuous, unbroken circuit exists. Another test measures the resistance to 
the flow of the current. Every electrical component has a specified amount of 
resistance that is measured in ohms. 
</P>
<P>
 Testing tells you if the component meets the original requirements set for it. 
</P>
<P>
 Ohmmeters also can test for short circuits that make components inoperable. 
</P>
<P>
 When the needle of the meter points to the symbol for infinity, the meter 
isn't capable of measuring the resistance of the tested part. Therefore, an 
open circuit exists and you need a new part. 
</P>
<P>
 When testing for continuity, you aren't seeking an exact numerical value. A 
circuit is either open or it isn't. If it's open, the needle will point to 
infinity. If the circuit isn't open, the needle will point to a number. 
</P>
<P>
 The appliance's switch needs to be turned on when testing for continuity or 
resistance. 
</P>
<P>
 If the switch is left off, it will cause the needle to point to infinity, 
indicating that there's an open circuit, which may not be the case. If the 
appliance has two switches, such as a toaster-oven, be sure both are switched 
on. 
</P>
<P>
 Most ohmmeters have a range-selector with three RX positions -- RX1, RX10 and 
RX100. Other meters have RX1000 (often designated RX1K) and RX10000 (RX10K) 
settings for reading greater ohm values. 
</P>
<P>
 To determine the resistance of a circuit or component, multiply the RX value 
by the number that the needle points to. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, if the range selector is set on RX1 and the needle points to 50, 
then the circuit has a resistance of 50 ohms. If the range selector was set at 
RX10, the circuit would have a resistance of 500 ohms. 
</P>
<P>
 When testing for continuity, start with the range selector at RX1. If the 
needle points to infinity, switch the selector to RX10 and then RX100. If the 
needle doesn't move off the infinity mark, an open circuit exists. 
</P>
<P>
 Often when checking the resistance value (ohms) with the meter set at RX1, 
you'll get a reading on the high end of the scale. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the high end isn't calibrated very precisely, switch the selector to 
RX10 and bring the needle into the lower, more precisely calibrated end of the 
scale. 
</P>
<P>
 The exact resistance values of the parts of an appliance are printed on a 
wiring diagram glued to the appliance. Appliance manufacturers can also provide 
resistance values for specific parts. 
</P>
<P>
 Another alternative is to check the resistance values listed in repair books. 
The reading that you get doesn't have to equal exactly what is listed in the 
book. 
</P>
<P>
 For example, a repair book lists the resistance value of an electric range 
cooking element at 50 ohms. If you get a reading of 45 ohms, that's close 
enough. A much lower reading of 10 ohms would indicate that a short exists in 
the element. When a short exists, the meter will display a low value -- it 
won't point to infinity.

DECORATING; LACE, RUFFLES AND LOTS OF WHITE AWAKEN ROMANCE OF VICTORIANS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERTA GRAFF 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Victorian bed linens came in any color you wanted -- as long as you wanted 
white. Depending on a person's means and social status, they might be coarse 
and much-mended, or made of the finest cottons or linen trimmed with delicate 
lace or embroidery. 
</P>
<P>
 Whatever their fabric or condition, their snowy whiteness was proof of 
housekeeping skills, and no easy task to maintain. 
</P>
<P>
 Once a week (on Monday in most homes), they were hand-laundered -- by the lady 
of the house, a servant or by a laundress -- and hung to dry outdoors, where 
the sun helped bleach them. 
</P>
<P>
 In many Victorian homes, linens were part of a bride's trousseau. Starting in 
childhood and guided by her mother, a girl made and collected sheets, pillow 
cases and napery with elaborate white-on-white embroidery or cutwork. 
</P>
<P>
 These treasures were lovingly tucked away in a cedar hope chest in preparation 
for the day she would marry and set up housekeeping. 
</P>
<P>
 In some European countries, the trousseau, decorated with flowers and ribbons, 
was put on display a few days before the wedding. The bridegroom collected it, 
piled it on a "dowry cart" pulled by oxen and drove it through town for all to 
see. 
</P>
<P>
 After the villagers expressed their approval of the bride-to-be's wealth and 
skill, the trousseau was brought to the couple's new home, where this enormous 
collection of linen -- meant to last a lifetime and be passed on to future 
generations -- was put to use. 
</P>
<P>
 Although this tradition has been modernized to keep step with social changes, 
the pristine white bedroom filled with romantic, ruffled bed linens is more 
popular than ever. It seems everyone -- grandmothers, career couples, singles, 
as well as those with marriage in mind -- wants them. 
</P>
<P>
 The bold geometrics and brightly colored plaid sheets and pillow cases that 
decorated beds a decade ago have, for the present, been relegated to the back 
of the linen closet. There has been a return to tradition and elegance, romance 
is in the air, and the unblemished white bedchamber is once again in style. 
</P>
<P>
 Antique shops, tag sales, even attics are being scoured for old linen and lace 
that lend the touch of fantasy to a bedroom. After all, is there any better 
guarantee for sweet dreams that a deliciously cool and airy white boudoir? 
</P>
<P>
 Manufacturers are responding to this call and designing exquisite white 
bedding lavishly trimmed with eyelet and lace that can be purchased at leading 
department stores and specialty shops. 
</P>
<P>
 Quality products, reflecting an elegance destined to withstand the test of 
time, are being offered in ensembles likely to become tomorrow's heirlooms. 
</P>
<P>
 To walk into a bedroom decorated with the Victoriana Collection of imported 
shams, bedspreads, dust ruffles, pillowcases and sheets by James Betesh is like 
stepping back in time. 
</P>
<P>
 The urge to sink into mountains of pillows covered in handmade Battenburg lace 
is irresistible. No less inviting is their Point De Venice collection of 100% 
fine cotton, or Elizabeth, a Croscill design of delicate white daisies and 
asters forming an eyelet pattern. 
</P>
<P>
 Light, cool and crisp bedding ensembles, inspired by the beauty of the Palace 
of Versailles, are produced by Cannon Mills in 60% Pima cotton blend and 40% 
polyester. "Renaissance," with lace edging as delicate as a butterfly's wings, 
is being shown by Wamsutta/Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
 The luxury of pure linen can never be underestimated. Ralph Lauren has 
designed pure linen sheets for J.P. Stevens, trimmed with rows of ruffles, 
eyelet embroidery and exquisite lace, to turn every bedchamber into a bridal 
suite. 
</P>
<P>
 In an era where days are a kaleidoscope of colors and noise, there is a need 
for a place of peace: a calm, private retreat where the body and mind can 
unwind. Could anything be more appealing than a pristine white bedroom . . . a 
sanctuary for solitude, an arena for dreams and a haven for romance?

WITH PROPER CARE, PHOTOS CONTINUE TO TELL STORIES

 The family album is family history captured in images. For some, the pictures 
may include daguerreotypes and tintypes from the 1800s as well as contemporary 
color prints. 
</P>
<P>
 In many families, the photographic record of milestones might begin with a 
portrait of great-grandparents on their wedding day, then continue with 
pictures of other important occasions: babies' baptisms, high school 
graduations or fathers posed in military uniforms before heading off to war. 
</P>
<P>
 Most antique personal photographs that have survived in good condition were 
either sealed under glass in standard-size, hinged tintype cases or inserted 
carefully into the thick cardboard leaves of a picture album. Remarkably large 
numbers of these containers can be discovered today, still filled with 
photographs in almost pristine condition. 
</P>
<P>
 However, careless handling, humid or overly bright environments and inevitable 
chemical deterioration have damaged thousands of old family photographs beyond 
repair. Daguerreotypes cannot be restored, and any tintype restoration should 
be attempted by experts only. 
</P>
<P>
 Many color photographs have suffered greatly, too, from improper storage or 
handling. If you are concerned about keeping valued images in a particular 
environment, seek counsel from a reputable authority on old photographs. 
Replace worn albums, if necessary. Buy acid-free envelopes and partitioned 
boxes for storing loose prints and negatives. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 To learn whether your damaged family photographs can be restored, contact the 
American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works. This 
organization offers a free referral system, called Foundation of the American 
Institute for Conservation, that will help you identify and locate conservation 
professionals. Mail your written request to: Foundation of American Institute 
for Conservation, 1717 K St., N.W., Suite 301, Washington, D.C. 26000.

UTILITIES; LITTLE COST-CUTTERS GENERATE WARM FEELINGS ON BILL-PAYING DAY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Some houses simply take more energy to run than others, but the worst of them 
can be made better by do-it-yourself efforts. 
</P>
<P>
 A number of low-cost and no-cost energy conservation practices can help nibble 
sizable chunks off your utility bills. 
</P>
<P>
 You can begin by reducing your water-heater temperature to 120 degrees 
Fahrenheit. 
</P>
<P>
 Install water-flow restricters on shower heads, install insulation behind 
electrical outlets and switch plates and add insulation over the attic stairs. 
</P>
<P>
 A faucet leak, small as it may be, is an energy waster. The fix may be as 
simple as a new washer. An often overlooked measure is vacuuming dusty 
baseboard heaters. 
</P>
<P>
 Other low-cost practices include lowering the thermostat on the heater to 55 
degrees when your family is out of the house for four hours or more. 
</P>
<P>
 An estimated value of energy-saving measures to reduce heat loss and cold-air 
infiltration through the roof, walls, floor, windows and doors would include 
items such as these: 
</P>
<P>
 * Caulking that costs about $50 to install can net a $250 first-year savings, 
or a two-month pay-back time; 
</P>
<P>
 * Weatherstripping that costs $20 to install can net $35 first-year savings, 
or a seven-month pay-back; 
</P>
<P>
 * Interior storm windows that cost $230 to install can save $53 the first year 
and give pay-back in 4 1/3 years; 
</P>
<P>
 * Attic insulation that costs $60 to install can save $40 the first year and 
pay for itself in 1 1/2 years. 
</P>
<P>
 * Water heater insulation that costs $15 can save $30 in a year, paying for 
itself in six months. 
</P>
<P>
 Costs and pay-back time vary depending on your situation, but these typical 
examples give an idea of the benefits you can expect. 
</P>
<P>
 Some simple but laborious jobs are worth learning, such as installing 
switch-plate insulation and weatherstripping. 
</P>
<P>
 Others, such as insulating an attic or, even harder, an outside wall, are 
probably jobs for a professional, although some super-handy homeowners with 
time at their disposal might be able to handle them. 
</P>
<P>
 Additional energy-saving measures that you may be able to handle, or hire a 
professional to handle for you, may include sloping the earth away from the 
house on all sides. 
</P>
<P>
 This will keep out water and moisture so the heating equipment can work more 
efficiently. 
</P>
<P>
 To better control heat use, consider a zone system. Dividing zones can 
sometimes be done by just installing doors at both ends of a long central hall. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have a fireplace, installing a fireplace insert in the central heating 
zone can greatly increase wood-burning efficiency while cutting heat loss up 
the chimney when not in use. Spot heating from portable heaters may also save 
energy. 
</P>
<P>
 If you have separate bedroom wings, consider replacing the central water 
heater by two separate smaller ones in the attic. 
</P>
<P>
 One over each wing would shorten hot water lines. One would be near the 
kitchen as well as its bedrooms. 
</P>
<P>
 The shorter lines would not lose as much heat, which would greatly reduce 
water heating costs -- a big chunk of your overall heating bill.

THE BEST HOSTS START WITH A THEME AND END WITH PARTY TO REMEMBER

<TEXT>
<P>
 "Who, what, when, where, and why" may be the basic questions in journalism, 
but they're equally important for planning a party. 
</P>
<P>
 "Why" is a great place to begin. Once you've decided this, the rest falls 
gracefully into place. Parties honoring those you love are the easiest because 
you need look no further than what makes them happy -- favorite foods, colors, 
music, flowers and, of course, people -- to make your festivity come together 
beautifully. 
</P>
<P>
 A theme can jump-start the process. And since it's the season to be outdoors, 
a theme might suggest itself right in your own back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Show off a ravishing garden with a Secret Garden tea or a painter's picnic in 
Provence. Give your pool and patio a workout with a West Indies beachside 
barbecue or an all-ages Treasure Island party, complete with sand, pirate gear 
and hidden treasure. Hold a Jungle Book party celebrating the 100th anniversary 
of this classic with everyone coming as animals. 
</P>
<P>
 Croquet, badminton, volleyball, horseshoes, softball and other competitions 
make for fun parties, as do the various summer holidays, but don't stop there. 
</P>
<P>
 San Francisco party planner Robin Collins suggests thumbing through 
old-fashioned calendars as well as international calendars for unusual holiday 
themes. She also believes in taking creative license. "The object, especially 
during summer, is to have fun," Collins says. "Why not have a romantic 
Valentine's Day engagement party in July? It's something that will give 
everyone a good laugh." 
</P>
<P>
 Foods are also fruitful themes. How about an Ode to the Strawberry dessert 
party, a garlic lover's potluck, a "high on the hog" spit roast or a Western 
chili cook-off with square dancing, cowboy attire and gingham tablecloths? 
</P>
<P>
 Organization is the key to any successful party. Staying organized is easier 
when you begin with a party planning journal. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins sets up a three-ring binder with six labeled sections: elements to 
consider; sources; menu; cooking; daily "to do" sheets, and a party day 
schedule. The first pages list number of guests, time of party, budgets, plus 
critical phone numbers, contact names and addresses. 
</P>
<P>
 Collins faithfully works her "to do" lists. "Anything not finished on a 
particular day is carried over to the next day," she explains. "It's so 
satisfying to cross things off, and it really keeps me organized." 
</P>
<P>
 Make your guest list early. You'll need it to determine your budget; it'll be 
essential information for negotiating catering, liquor, furniture rentals and 
other services. 
</P>
<P>
 To avoid overlooking friends and family, comb your address book carefully 
after making your list, then have someone close to you review the list again. 
</P>
<P>
 Outdoor entertaining is typically relaxed. But if you're contemplating a 
formal party consider: What is the reason for the party? What style best fits 
the theme? What is your budget? How much time do you have to plan? 
</P>
<P>
 "Formal parties require a real time and money commitment to do right," Collins 
says. "So be realistic about what you can do and how much you can comfortably 
spend." 
</P>
<P>
 Avoid taking on too much. Take a good hard look at what you'll need to do and 
when you'll need it done and delegate accordingly. Ask family members to help 
cook, pay local kids to set up and clean up, or use a party planner to contract 
with caterers, waiters, musicians and a bartender. 
</P>
<P>
 Maybe you can do it all, but at what cost? Chuck Williams, founder of the 
Williams Sonoma stores and co-author of a new outdoor entertaining book, sums 
it up: "If the host is tired, harried or stressed out, guests feel it, and it's 
going to affect everyone's ability to have a good time." 
</P>
<P>
 A solid party resource list is essential. Ask those whose taste and opinions 
you highly regard for their recommendations. Be sure to shop around, though. 
You'll find that prices, attitudes, products and time frames vary dramatically. 
</P>
<P>
 Get everything in writing and be scrupulous about adding contracts, phone 
numbers, contacts, addresses, estimates and receipts to your party journal.

FOR INSPIRATION, LOOK TO YOUR OWN BACK YARD

 When Beverly Reese Church, co-author of "The Joys of Entertaining" and author 
of the new "Wedding Southern Style," entertains outdoors, she relies on some 
key and some unexpected supplies. Once her party goods are gathered up, she 
chooses a motif, and is partial to painting it all over her linens, serving 
pieces and favors. 
</P>
<P>
 "I like to be creative when I entertain, and a motif gives me a great place to 
start," Church says. "Your motif can be as simple as a favorite flower that's 
blooming in your garden," Church says, "or a featured food that's part of your 
menu -- maybe watermelon or chili peppers." 
</P>
<P>
 To help you host an outdoor party in your own casual, creative style, Church's 
list of party essentials and ideas offers lots of inspiration: 
</P>
<P>
 * Market umbrellas opened over a few tables, or even just one, lend 
high-impact ambience to an outdoor party. Customize a white or off-white 
umbrella by painting or stenciling a border along the edge, using permanent 
fabric paint. As you'll want to use this umbrella again, choose a design that 
will be appealing throughout the outdoor season. 
</P>
<P>
 * For tablecloths or picnic cloths, choose full-size sheets in floral, 
geometric or animal patterns or in checks. The clue to the perfect theme for 
your party may be found in your sheets. Is there a graceful floral that you can 
copy? A black-and-white check could set off featured chili peppers or tomatoes 
in a bold way. Colored sheets lose their punch after a few washings, so Church 
recommends spot cleaning if at all possible. 
</P>
<P>
 * Place mats can be made from gesso-backed canvas. Paint oversize elements of 
your motif on the canvas -- maybe a star from your night-sky patterned fabric 
-- then cut them out. Scatter these over your patterned tablecloths for a 
casual yet sophisticated tabletop approach. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clay saucers make wonderful, rustic dinner and serving plates. Buy 10- or 
12-inch saucers and boil them before your party. Line the plate with greens, 
such as kale, then arrange food in individual ramekins. 
</P>
<P>
 * Inexpensive glasses, napkins and napkin rings can be customized by painting 
your party motif on them using water-based enamel and fabric paint. 
</P>
<P>
 * Clay pots filled with blooming flowers add color to your party scene. Not 
only are clay saucers and pots inexpensive, you'll find plenty of secondary 
uses for them year-round. 
</P>
<P>
 * For a centerpiece that wraps around the base of your umbrella, soak an oasis 
ring (that green, hard foam that florists use to secure arrangements, available 
at craft stores) in water, then cover it with ivy or another green. Then mix in 
colorful seasonal flowers. You can also trail some ivy artfully up the pole, as 
long as the roots are secure in the water-drenched oasis. 
</P>
<P>
 * Place cards and favors can be one and the same. If your meal will be hot and 
spicy, use a length of raffia to tie a name card and a tiny flower around the 
neck of a small bottle of Tabasco. Or, paint plain white cake boxes and fill 
with cookies, jams or pralines for each guest to take home. 
</P>
<P>
 * Cluster groups of votive candles and glass holders on tables to create a 
soft, pretty glow. 
</P>
<P>
 * Use torchier for lighting your entrance and garden in charming style. 
</P>
<P>
 * Citronella candles will help keep bugs at bay.

PROSECUTORS ASK FULL SEQUESTERING OF SIMPSON JURY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ANDREA FORD and DAVID FERRELL, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 To protect jurors from intense media coverage of the O.J. Simpson double 
murder trial, prosecutors Friday asked Judge Lance A. Ito to sequester jury 
members from the time they are selected until their discharge, meaning they 
could be kept from their families and jobs for months. 
</P>
<P>
 If granted, the unusual request for gavel-to-gavel sequestration could lay 
important groundwork for one of the most closely watched trials in modern 
history, perhaps shaping the composition of the 12-member panel and even 
influencing the jury to favor one side or the other, according to some 
attorneys and legal scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The jurors have a stake in the outcome because they're held hostage," said 
veteran Los Angeles defense attorney Barry Levin, who, like other experts, said 
that if the jury is sequestered there would be additional pressures from within 
the group to reach a speedier verdict. 
</P>
<P>
 Typically in such instances, Levin said, the result is a subtle advantage for 
prosecutors because jurors are constantly surrounded by court bailiffs or other 
representatives of government. 
</P>
<P>
 "The defense's function is to . . . (challenge) the government," Levin said. 
"You're wanting jurors to question government authority. You're wanting them to 
disagree with the government's positions and theories -- and their lives are 
controlled by the government." 
</P>
<P>
 Sequestration of juries is not unusual in high-profile cases, but most of the 
time jurors are put up in hotels only during deliberations after they have 
heard testimony. The request by the Simpson prosecutors is designed to keep 
jurors from exposure to the media through every phase of the trial, scheduled 
to begin Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Not every expert agrees that such a situation would favor one side or the 
other. But the debate touches on the thorny question of how best to ensure 
fairness in a case in which even the tiniest twists and turns end up on 
national television and in newspaper headlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Though Ito has yet to rule on the prosecution's request, the judge has said he 
is considering a partial sequestration of jurors that would shield them from 
outsiders during court proceedings but allow them to go home for the night. 
</P>
<P>
 Under that plan, Ito said, he would try to lessen the temptation of jurors to 
sneak peeks at news reports by clipping newspapers and magazines and recording 
broadcast reports, then providing copies to each juror at the end of the trial. 
</P>
<P>
 But Deputy Dist. Attys. Marcia Clark and William Hodgman objected to that 
scheme in the papers filed Friday, saying jurors still could be exposed. 
Although acknowledging the potentially enormous cost of providing hotel 
accommodations to more than a dozen jurors -- including alternates -- 
throughout months of trial, the two prosecutors argued that it would cost even 
more to go through a retrial made necessary by jury contamination. 
</P>
<P>
 "If ever there was a jury in the history of the world that needed protection 
from publicity, this jury is the one," they wrote in their motion Friday. 
"Given the massive media coverage so far, one can only expect the publicity to 
intensify during trial." 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors also asked that potential jurors be questioned about their 
attitudes singly rather than in batches -- to ensure that one juror's answers 
do not influence another potential juror who is listening. 
</P>
<P>
 In support of those requests, Clark and Hodgman told the court that a search 
of newspaper and magazine computer databases revealed that Simpson's name had 
been mentioned 15,310 times since June 12, the day of the slayings of his 
ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Lyle Goldman. 
</P>
<P>
 Even the early grand jury inquiry into the murders had to be ended because 
some of the grand jurors acknowledged listening to news reports about a 911 
tape in which Simpson and his ex-wife were purportedly involved in a domestic 
dispute -- a tape considered highly prejudicial, the prosecutors said. 
</P>
<P>
 News leaks have continued since then, they added, from both sides -- some of 
them erroneous. 
</P>
<P>
 In such an environment, there simply is no way to conduct business as usual, 
according to some scholars. 
</P>
<P>
 "The (full) sequestration of this jury is an unfortunate necessity," said 
Peter Arenella, a UCLA law professor, who noted that he expects extensive, 
ongoing analysis and commentary about the case in the media from legal experts 
who have been hired by news organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has become an event where there are so many legal commentators 
speculating about what this piece of evidence does or does not mean, even a 
juror who tried in good faith to avoid it would probably find that impossible 
unless they became a social hermit," Arenella said. 
</P>
<P>
 Norman M. Garland, a former public defender who is a professor at Southwestern 
University School of Law, expressed similar views, saying that sequestration 
may be preferable to imposing a sweeping gag order, as Ito indicated that he 
might do until a backlash of reaction forced the judge to reconsider. 
</P>
<P>
 The legal fight over a gag order could create its own contamination of the 
trial, Garland said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everything that is happening in this case is being looked at under a 
microscope," he said. "Every time you turn around, you find out things you 
didn't want to know. And the risk of (the jury facing) that kind of exposure is 
going to do nothing but grow." 
</P>
<P>
 In the papers prosecutors filed Friday, they even expressed concern that 
jurors might be followed home by aggressive reporters or be tempted to take the 
initiative in contacting the media. 
</P>
<P>
 "While the court's offer to collect articles and videotapes concerning the 
case for post-trial review is thoughtful and generous," the prosecutors wrote, 
"the truth of the matter is that it will not quench a juror's immediate thirst 
to learn how the public (or media) views a particularly critical day of 
testimony." 
</P>
<P>
 If full sequestration is ordered throughout the trial, the already daunting 
task of selecting jurors may become much harder, experts said. 
</P>
<P>
 Garland said he believes that the system will work, regardless. If potential 
jurors know in advance that they will be sequestered, it should be possible -- 
at least in theory -- to find candidates willing to endure the hardship and 
still apply themselves to reaching an impartial verdict, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 He disagreed with those who believe that sequestration would favor the 
prosecution. "One of the things we fear with sequestration is that the jury is 
going to get ticked off and reach a quick decision -- and that could cut either 
way." 
</P>
<P>
 But Levin, the veteran defense lawyer, sharply criticized the proposal to 
sequester, maintaining that the bias it creates in favor of the prosecution 
would be exacerbated by the difficulty in finding a balanced mix of jurors. 
</P>
<P>
 "What kind of person could put aside their entire lives -- financially, 
personally and professionally -- and be locked up in a hotel room for three to 
six months?" Levin asked. The answer, most likely, would be retired people or 
those who are independently wealthy, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Such jurors may be far different in background and attitude from Simpson -- a 
black man of urban upbringing who, though wealthy, works for a living. 
</P>
<P>
 "You're not getting a jury of your peers," Levin said. 
</P>
<P>
 Upcoming evidence hearings -- including one to debate the admissibility of DNA 
evidence -- pose yet another problem in jury selection, UCLA's Arenella said. 
</P>
<P>
 If jurors were picked before those hearings, they could be forced to wait a 
month or so before being allowed to begin considering evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 If they were sequestered during that time, they would have to bide those weeks 
in hotel rooms with little to do and little contact with the outside world. On 
the other hand, if they were allowed to go home during that break, they might 
hear about evidence that ultimately was ruled inadmissible during the trial, 
Arenella said. This could force some panelists to be dismissed, which in turn 
would require selection of a new jury even before the trial could begin in 
earnest.

SUSPECT'S ARREST LIFTS VEIL ON 'FINANCIAL SCAM OF '90S'; MONEY: MILLIONS ARE 
LOST IN 'PRIME BANK NOTE' SCHEMES. ONE FINANCIER, HAROLD GLANTZ, INSISTS HE IS 
INNOCENT. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MYRON LEVIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harold Glantz bought himself a glamorous address, a $5-million house on 
Pacific Coast Highway with a panorama of the blue Pacific and the beach for his 
back yard. Today, however, he sits in a New York jail cell, charged by U.S. and 
Dutch authorities with stealing $30 million from investors. 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz, a New York businessman who has been linked to underworld figures, is 
accused along with several others of ripping off the Salvation Army in England 
and wealthy investors in Germany and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities say he funneled part of the loot into pricey Southern California 
real estate -- including the Malibu beach house and fashionable homes for a son 
and a daughter in Los Angeles and Santa Monica. 
</P>
<P>
 Although his lawyers maintain that he is innocent, authorities have portrayed 
him as a major player in a type of fraud that one investigator has dubbed "the 
financial scam of the '90s." 
</P>
<P>
 These scams, which usually target big investors, involve the marketing of 
bogus financial instruments, sometimes called "prime bank notes," "prime bank 
guarantees" or "prime bank standby letters of credit." 
</P>
<P>
 Lured by promises of huge, risk-free returns from a mythical market in these 
instruments, wealthy investors and institutions have lost millions of dollars 
to clever con artists around the world. Investors victimized by prime note 
scams have included the National Council of Churches, which lost $8 million; 
the Chicago Housing Authority's pension fund, which dropped $19 million, and 
the South Pacific island state of Nauru, out $13 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Total losses may top $500 million, said Jim Byrne, a law professor at George 
Mason University in Virginia and an expert on letters of credit. 
</P>
<P>
 Concerned about the proliferation of these scams, U.S. agencies that supervise 
financial institutions -- including the Federal Reserve, the Federal Deposit 
Insurance Corp. and the Comptroller of the Currency -- issued a joint alert 
last October. 
</P>
<P>
 Similar warnings have come from the Commercial Crime Bureau of the 
International Chamber of Commerce and the U.S. Securities and Exchange 
Commission, which in the last two years has filed 16 prime bank actions -- 
including a lawsuit last month against Glantz. 
</P>
<P>
 Legitimate instruments known as letters of credit are guarantees that banks 
provide customers to back up contracts -- such as a promise to pay for a 
shipment of goods within so many days of delivery. They are the bank's pledge 
to meet the obligation in case the customer defaults. 
</P>
<P>
 As such, letters of credit have no value beyond the specific transaction and, 
according to experts, cannot be traded in a secondary market. 
</P>
<P>
 But this is just the illusion the swindlers promote. Often they describe an 
arcane, virtually clandestine market in which the world's elite ("prime") banks 
and other heavy-hitters trade the instruments for hefty profits. The swindlers 
profess to have access to this market, enabling their clients to enjoy 
risk-free returns that will double their money or better. 
</P>
<P>
 In a typical pitch, investors may be told they can buy a one-year letter of 
credit at, say, 85 cents on the dollar -- an instrument that costs $850,000 and 
can be cashed in 12 months for the face value of $1 million. But, according to 
the pitch, the real money is to be made in a "roll program," in which 
discounted instruments are bought and almost immediately resold at a small 
profit, a process repeated over and over to create astronomical returns. 
</P>
<P>
 Byrne said many of the offerings are "preposterous" and wouldn't fool "an 
expert in letters of credit . . . for more than 30 seconds." 
</P>
<P>
 But what the swindlers "effectively do is cut the person off from his 
legitimate advisers, or confuse them enough that no one ever goes to a real 
source of expertise," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Knowing that professional titles lend a veneer of credibility, the crooks 
often employ lawyers and accountants -- using them to lull victims and to set 
up bank accounts abroad from which the money typically disappears. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you want to quote two words, it's deception and greed, " said John 
Shockey, a special assistant in the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency 
and an authority on prime bank frauds. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the lure of quick profits, because everything is now, " he said. "You 
provide these funds, and not only can I return your principal, but a huge 
profit immediately." 
</P>
<P>
 The frauds sometimes fit the mold of Ponzi schemes, in which investors 
initially receive income (usually from their own principal) to create an 
illusion of profits and lure new victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Other times, the frauds are married to advance-fee schemes, in which people 
seeking loans pay upfront fees for financing they never get. According to 
Shockey, prospective borrowers are told their fees will buy letters of credit 
to serve as collateral for loans, but the documents never materialize. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the scams have flowered in exotic locales. 
</P>
<P>
 Consider the case of Nauru, a tiny South Pacific island nation of 9,000 people 
that became fabulously wealthy from phosphate mining royalties. In 1991, 
Nauru's phosphate royalty trust was swindled out of about $13 million in a 
prime bank scam involving the Commonwealth National Bank of Antigua. Two 
officials of that bank were convicted last year in New York in a separate 
white-collar scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Another fraud brought scandal and ruin to the Czech Republic's Banka Bohemia, 
once a shining star of that country's shift to a market economy. The bank was 
liquidated in July amid allegations that bank officials seeking Western capital 
had been tricked or corrupted into issuing hundreds of millions of dollars of 
largely unredeemable notes that were being peddled in the United States and 
Europe. 
</P>
<P>
 Among those stuck with the notes was the National Council of Churches, the 
oldest and largest ecumenical church group in the United States. In December, 
the council paid nearly $8 million from a retired employees' health insurance 
fund for Banka Bohemia notes with a supposed redemption value of $12 million. 
Now in court in London trying to recover its investment, the council has fired 
two officials for failing to consult an in-house investment committee. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chicago Housing Authority's pension fund was another big loser. A former 
housing authority executive put about $19 million from the pension fund into 
prime bank investments that were "nothing more than a scam," according to the 
Securities and Exchange Commission -- which in June sued the former executive, 
along with investment promoters in the United States and the Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
 Two Chinese American businessmen and two Chinese banking officials were 
sentenced in May to long prison terms in China in a scheme involving the 
Agricultural Bank of China. According to news reports, Francisco Hung Moy and 
Raymond Lee persuaded officials of a rural branch of the bank to issue 200 
letters of credit with a redemption value of $10 billion. Collateral for the 
deal was a $10-billion letter of credit from a nonexistent Russian bank. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Chinese authorities have vowed not to honor the letters of credit and 
most have been recovered, some may yet be circulating among unsuspecting 
traders. 
</P>
<P>
 As law enforcement agencies fight back, one case they are putting pressure on 
involves Glantz -- a man with a checkered business career and seemingly a 
penchant for living on the edge. 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz was arrested in April in New York on an extradition warrant from the 
Netherlands, where he and a Dutch associate have been charged with stealing 
$4.36 million from the Salvation Army and $775,000 from John C. Hammeke, a 
private investor from Kansas. Glantz has remained in custody pending an 
extradition hearing later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 "There has not been any impropriety here," said Glantz's attorney, Herb 
Kantor. According to Kantor, Glantz failed to complete the investment deals 
simply because some parties "felt insecure and began objecting and seeking to 
freeze matters where they were." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Glantz and two other men were indicted by a federal grand jury in 
Boston on charges of swindling $24 million from German investors in another 
prime bank fraud scheme. 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz, 61, who lists his occupation as "the private placement of commercial 
paper for banks and institutions in Europe," has had links to organized crime 
figures for many years, according to court documents and official reports. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Glantz's lawyers acknowledged his association with reputed mobsters, 
but attributed it to Glantz's upbringing in a poor area of New York. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are certain people who grow up on certain streets in New York," 
attorney Robert A. Scher told The Times. "You can never turn your back on what 
you are and who you are." 
</P>
<P>
 He is "all aces with me," Scher said. "The man's word is his bond. . . . He is 
one of the most decent human beings that I ever in my life have met." 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz's alleged links to underworld figures were cited in a 1970 report by a 
New York state commission on mob infiltration of legitimate businesses. 
According to the report, Glantz was involved in running bagel shops with 
members of the Genovese organized crime family. 
</P>
<P>
 He also was president of Bagels U.S.A. Inc., a chain of bagel stores whose 
stock offering was suspended by the SEC. The agency said the offering failed to 
disclose material facts, including loans owed by Bagels U.S.A. and the 
identities of owners of its predecessor firms. 
</P>
<P>
 Glantz has also been involved in running amusement parks, including one in the 
New York City borough of Queens. When the site was condemned in the 1970s, 
Glantz sought the city's help in opening a new park in Brooklyn. However, city 
officials lost interest after running a check on Glantz. 
</P>
<P>
 In a 1976 letter to New York City's Economic Development Administration, the 
city's Department of Investigation said law enforcement officials believed that 
"close ties have existed between Mr. Glantz and high-level organized crime 
figures." Glantz sued for defamation, but the claim was dismissed by the 
courts. 
</P>
<P>
 After a failed attempt to buy the Todd Shipyards in Brooklyn, Glantz was sued 
in 1990 for allegedly borrowing $1.2 million for the purchase and failing to 
return the money when the deal fell through. 
</P>
<P>
 His creditor was a man in the construction business named Emanuel Garofalo -- 
a reputed associate of mob figures whose brother, Edward Garofalo, was the 
victim of a mob-style execution about the time the suit was filed. 
</P>
<P>
 The dispute caused Glantz some uneasiness, according to court papers filed by 
his lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Glantz and Garofalo were longtime friends, Glantz believed Garofalo 
"has been, for many years, associated with some of the legends of organized 
crime in the metropolitan area," Scher wrote. 
</P>
<P>
 And Garofalo's brother, Eddie, "was the subject of a sudden, severe and fatal 
case of lead poisoning not too many months ago," Scher went on, adding that 
Glantz and his wife "live in fear that some of Mr. Garofalo's associates will 
deliberately do harm to them as a result of some of the transactions which lie 
in the background of this complaint." 
</P>
<P>
 The next year, Glantz was reported to have been murdered by the mob. In a 
debriefing by the FBI in November, 1991, mobster-turned-informant Alphonso 
(Little Al) D'Arco said he understood that Glantz had been killed for failing 
to pay a $600,000 debt to former Gambino family underboss Salvatore (Sammy the 
Bull) Gravano, and Eddie Garofalo, the "lead poisoning" victim. 
</P>
<P>
 D'Arco was wrong, however. Glantz was very much alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Early in 1992, Hammeke, a retired ophthalmologist from Leavenworth, Kan., 
signed an investment agreement with Continental Capital Markets Inc., a firm 
Glantz ran out of his fashionable apartment on East 57th Street in New York 
City. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammeke, 67, placed $1 million in a "roll program," in which letters of credit 
were to be bought and sold for a profit of $225,000 per transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 His funds were deposited in an account at Merrill Lynch and transferred first 
to one Swiss bank, then another. Ultimately, the $1 million was moved to the 
Kansallis International Bank in Luxembourg, where Glantz's Dutch associate, 
Guido Haak, had opened an account. 
</P>
<P>
 Hammeke later told Dutch investigators he thought his funds were safe because 
he had signed papers stating that Continental Capital could not "send the money 
to themselves." But according to Dutch authorities, Glantz had signing power 
over funds in the Kansallis account, and had granted the same to Haak. 
</P>
<P>
 According to documents filed in the extradition case, Glantz and Haak began 
draining the Hammeke account in July, 1992, transferring funds to other bank 
accounts in the Netherlands and the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 With Hammeke's suspicions ripening into fears, Glantz sent him $225,000 -- 
ostensibly profits from the first successful "roll" transaction. As Hammeke 
told Dutch investigators, he later realized the payment -- the only money he 
ever got back -- was intended to make him "keep quiet and keep faith." 
</P>
<P>
 Dutch authorities say Glantz and Haak used the depleted Hammeke account to 
embezzle the Salvation Army funds. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army funds had already been looted when Glantz came on the 
scene. According to Salvation Army lawyers and Dutch investigators, however, 
Glantz and his band were lurking downstream to rob the original thieves. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army's troubles began when a fund-raiser and financial adviser 
named Stuart Ford befriended a few well-placed officials at Salvation Army 
headquarters in England, and suggested a better way to invest donations and 
bequests. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford introduced them to Gamil Naguib, an Egyptian-born Canadian and supposedly 
a senior executive with the Islamic-Pan American Bank. This elusive institution 
and an affiliate, Eastech International Bank, had surfaced the year before in 
an insurance fraud case. When FBI agents dropped by the Dallas office that 
supposedly served as the banks' U.S. headquarters, they found it occupied by a 
nightclub management firm. 
</P>
<P>
 Salvation Army officials decided to take the plunge and in May, 1992, 
transferred $10 million to a bank in Antwerp, Belgium, for investment in 
letters of credit. The charity still controlled the funds because the account 
bore the names of two Salvation Army officials and Ford, and required two 
signatures for withdrawal. 
</P>
<P>
 The next month, however, Ford and a Salvation Army official transferred $8.8 
million to a different bank in Luxembourg. Again, two signatures out of three 
were needed to access the funds, but this time Ford and Naguib were 
signatories. 
</P>
<P>
 The floodgates opened. According to lawyers for the Salvation Army, about half 
the money was cycled back to England to be used by Ford in loans and other 
ventures. The remaining $4.36 million stayed with Naguib -- but not for long. 
</P>
<P>
 How the $4.36 million was allowed to fall into Glantz's hands remains 
something of a mystery. Naguib may actually have believed in the market in 
letters of credit, or felt pressure to invest the funds as promised. Whatever 
the reason, Naguib, working through intermediaries, sought to put the $4.36 
million into a $5-million letter of credit. 
</P>
<P>
 His agents soon were put in touch with Leslie R. Barth, a Connecticut attorney 
who was to help with the transaction. 
</P>
<P>
 A graduate of the Wharton School of Business and Harvard Law School, Barth was 
also a longtime Glantz associate who had once gone to prison in a tax case. 
</P>
<P>
 When he offered his services in June, 1992, Barth also was under indictment in 
Connecticut in an investment case. He would later be convicted of mail and wire 
fraud in that case and get a 15-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
 Naguib's intermediaries presumably knew nothing of this. And they went along 
in August, 1992, when Barth and Glantz suggested using the Hammeke account to 
"expedite the transaction." 
</P>
<P>
 "Another counsel, Mr. Hammeke, a longtime customer of the bank, was the 
original holder of this account," Barth and Glantz explained in their letter -- 
even though Hammeke was not a lawyer and had banked at Kansallis just long 
enough to lose his shirt. 
</P>
<P>
 When the $4.36 million reached the Hammeke account at Kansallis, authorities 
say, Glantz began dispersing it to bank accounts in the Netherlands and the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
 In the wake of the scandal, the Salvation Army has dismissed one officer and 
transferred three others. Salvation Army lawyers in England have won 
multimillion-dollar legal judgments against Ford and Naguib, although it is 
unclear how much they will collect. 
</P>
<P>
 Ford could not be reached for comment, and his lawyer did not return phone 
calls. Contacted in Belgium, Naguib declined comment, saying, "I'm sorry, I'm 
not allowed to talk to anyone on that subject." 
</P>
<P>
 The Salvation Army has also filed lawsuits in Los Angeles seeking to wrest 
control of properties Glantz bought in 1992 and 1993 for himself and two of his 
children. 
</P>
<P>
 In the three lawsuits -- each relating to one of the property transactions -- 
the Salvation Army says its plundered millions were used to buy the homes. 
</P>
<P>
 In response, lawyers for Glantz said in court papers that Glantz "has not been 
unjustly enriched," and that the Salvation Army's losses resulted from its 
decision to engage in "patently risky foreign investment activities." 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. government has also laid claim to Glantz's Malibu beach house and a 
shopping center in West Hollywood in connection with the Boston case. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the 118-count indictment unsealed Thursday, Glantz and two 
associates, doing business as Kinder Capital Inc., talked eight wealthy 
Europeans into investing $24 million in so-called prime bank notes and 
discounted letters of credit. The investors were assured they would double 
their money in a year and that the money would remain under their control in 
accounts at the Bank of Boston in Marblehead, Mass. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the indictment said, the money disappeared almost as soon as it was 
deposited. Glantz was said to have used his share to cover personal expenses, 
to make loans to friends and to help purchase and decorate his Malibu retreat. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. attorney's office said he also used $2 million of the proceeds to 
repay two victims from a previous scheme. The victims, a New Jersey investor 
and the pension fund of a small Pennsylvania manufacturer, were persuaded to 
put up $1 million each to trade in "prime bank" notes. Glantz allegedly repaid 
the money within days of learning that the Securities and Exchange Commission 
was investigating him in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 That did not seem to have helped much, however. On Aug. 8, the Securities and 
Exchange Commission sued Glantz in federal court in New York.

NEWS ANALYSIS; LAW FIRM'S ARROGANCE CITED IN HUGE HARASSMENT AWARD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARTHA GROVES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 How many lawyers does it take to pay off a $6.9-million damage award in a 
sexual harassment suit? 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry, Baker & McKenzie. This is no run-of-the-mill lawyer joke. 
</P>
<P>
 A San Francisco jury's decision to sock the world's largest law firm with 
record punitive damages for failing to protect a legal secretary from 
harassment by a senior partner sends a powerful message: that juries will not 
tolerate rich companies -- law firms in particular -- that act as if they are 
above the law, lawyers and legal experts said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 But society's longtime contempt for lawyers' high fees and their ability to 
take either side of an issue probably played a role, too. 
</P>
<P>
 The massive award, announced Thursday, indicates "a combination of disdain for 
sexual harassment and for lawyers who do not act professionally," said Howard 
Varinsky, a jury consultant for the attorneys representing Rena Weeks, 40, who 
sued the 1,700-lawyer firm in May, 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 "I found it odd that it was such a large verdict," said Harvey I. Saferstein, 
a partner with the Los Angeles law firm of Irell & Manella and former president 
of the State Bar of California. "It wouldn't surprise me if there were some 
lawyer hostility going on." 
</P>
<P>
 Jane Thomas, an attorney in San Francisco with Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & 
Hampton who sat through most of the trial, said: "The closing arguments of Phil 
Kay (one of Weeks' attorneys) really tapped into that vein -- a vein of 
distrust for big-firm lawyers, lawyers who make a lot of money." 
</P>
<P>
 That said, other lawyers and jurors interviewed Friday contended that the $6.9 
million assessed against Chicago-based Baker & McKenzie had more to do with 
Americans' growing realization and abhorrence of sexual harassment in the 
workplace. 
</P>
<P>
 Weeks had accused Martin Greenstein, a former Baker & McKenzie partner who had 
been a big moneymaker in the firm's Palo Alto office, of groping her and making 
crude remarks. Among the allegations were charges that he had pulled back her 
arms to see which of her breasts was bigger. 
</P>
<P>
 Trial testimony showed that other women had made similar complaints against 
Greenstein but that the firm had done nothing to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 Greenstein, a divorced father of four, earned $550,000 in his last year as a 
Baker & McKenzie partner, court records show. Pressured to leave the firm in 
October, he now makes about $225,000 to $240,000 a year and has a net worth of 
$1.93 million. 
</P>
<P>
 The jury also assessed $225,000 in punitive damages against Greenstein on 
Thursday. A week earlier, during the trial's first stage, the same jury had 
awarded Weeks $50,000 in damages for emotional distress. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the $6.9 million award -- nearly double the amount that Weeks had 
sought -- that set jaws dropping and e-mail flashing in the legal community. 
</P>
<P>
 Representatives of the firm, which has 90 lawyers at its offices in San 
Francisco, Palo Alto and San Diego, labeled the amount excessive. Abby 
Silberman, a partner in Baker & McKenzie's employment law area, said the firm 
plans to seek a steep reduction in the amount from Superior Court Judge John 
Munter, who presided over the five-week trial. Lawyers and jurors contacted 
Friday widely expected that the firm would be successful in its request. 
</P>
<P>
 Jurors indicated that they took Baker & McKenzie's power and wealth into 
account when assessing damages. Last year, the firm had gross revenues of $512 
million and distributed $189 million to its partners. It had net profits of $65 
million. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Baker & McKenzie lawyers (who served as witnesses) were talking 
legalese," said juror Francis Lewis, 58, a retired deck officer with the U.S. 
merchant marine. "In the real world, they came across as dishonest." 
</P>
<P>
 What mattered to the jury, Lewis said, was not that they were lawyers per se 
but that theirs was the biggest law firm in the world and that "the way they 
treated their lower-paid employees was unconscionable." He added: "It was the 
abuse of authority." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked whether he feels any prejudice against lawyers, Lewis laughed and said: 
"No, no, no. . . . My brother and my father are lawyers." 
</P>
<P>
 He acknowledged, however, that in the jury room "there were amusing asides 
about Shakespeare being right, but they were just in passing." 
</P>
<P>
 Juror William Carpenter, a 70-year-old retired teacher in San Francisco, said 
that the hefty judgment grew out of what the panel perceived as Baker & 
McKenzie's arrogance and inept handling of the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "We felt we were being lied to," said Carpenter, whose niece passed the Bar 
recently and works for a San Francisco firm. 
</P>
<P>
 As for lawyers in general, Carpenter said: "They're not all bad people, but 
some of them are very arrogant. You get power, you use it." 
</P>
<P>
 Carpenter, when asked whether he could say he truly feels no prejudice against 
lawyers, said: "Sure, I can say it, and I think I can mean it. But I'll tell 
anti-lawyer jokes because it's not totally politically incorrect to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite all the wisecracks Americans make at the legal profession's expense, 
"people respect lawyers more than lawyers think they do," said Varinsky, the 
jury consultant, who has extensively surveyed attitudes on the subject. "They 
hold lawyers in high esteem, equal to doctors. They really expect professional 
behavior." 
</P>
<P>
 Barbara Clark, a former Baker & McKenzie attorney who is now with Pettit & 
Martin in San Francisco, said she wondered at the beginning of the trial 
whether "these people were doomed from the outset" because of a pervasive 
let's-get-the-lawyers sentiment. 
</P>
<P>
 "Perhaps that's fair to hold them to a higher standard," she said. "That's 
what we do for a living. I wouldn't expect a butcher to buy bad meat."

AS SHELTER MOURNS VICTIM, LIFE -- AND DEATH -- GO ON; VIOLENCE: SLAYING SHOWS 
HOW AID TO BATTERED WOMEN CAN FALL SHORT. LONG-TERM PROGRAMS, RESOURCES ARE 
LACKING. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The news swept through the shelter for battered women, casting a chill on all 
who heard it. One of the shelter's own, Maria Pizano, 29, had been shot dead 
near Bakersfield by her longtime live-in companion, who then turned the gun on 
himself. 
</P>
<P>
 Horrified counselors and clients at South Bay-based Rainbow Services wept at 
the first killing in memory of a former Rainbow resident. 
</P>
<P>
 For them, the Aug. 7 shooting is bitter proof that the shelter system's 
painstaking efforts to protect women -- using restraining orders, counseling, 
temporary housing at a secret address -- sometimes fall short when women leave 
the shelter's protective walls. 
</P>
<P>
 Struggling to understand the tragedy, Rainbow employees gathered the week 
after Pizano's death for a session that was part wake, part support group, 
attempting to summon the stamina to move ahead and help other women. 
</P>
<P>
 "It would be really hard for me to do this work if I acknowledged how often 
the murders of women occur," said counselor Anne Brace. Program manager Cheryl 
Majka bluntly asked the group: "How do we maintain hope?" 
</P>
<P>
 That is a key question this summer at Rainbow, which remains a shelter in 
mourning. Some who work or live here have been sleeping fitfully, consoling one 
another, glancing around fearfully as they walk outdoors -- or raging with 
frustration at a legal system and a society that they believe failed Pizano. 
</P>
<P>
 With domestic violence in California blamed for 329 homicides in 1993 and the 
network of 17 shelters in Los Angeles County stretched thin with too few beds 
for so many frightened women, running a safe house can feel like plugging a 
collapsing dike. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts say Rainbow could have done little to prevent Pizano's killing, 
because it is a short-term shelter where women can live for only about 30 to 45 
days immediately after leaving an abuser, and Pizano had completed her stay 
there. She returned home to Bakersfield with her three sons soon after, 
propelled by economic necessity and loneliness. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps Pizano would have benefited from a longer-term transitional shelter, 
suggest women's advocates who say that many women cannot remake their lives in 
just one month. But fewer than 30 long-term shelter beds are available for 
battered women countywide. 
</P>
<P>
 So at Rainbow, where 18 women and children filled every bed this week, the 
staff is fighting new battles for new clients even as they ruminate about why 
Pizano died. 
</P>
<P>
 They recall that when Pizano lived at the nonprofit shelter last spring, she 
had glowed with a good-humored spunkiness that defied the popular notion of the 
battered, broken woman. 
</P>
<P>
 One evening she borrowed a tape recorder and, when the children were in bed, 
set the shelter's living room reverberating with lively Mexican music. Then she 
laughingly coaxed other women and counselors to learn the intricate dance 
steps. 
</P>
<P>
 "She was just so happy, like, 'I just won the lottery, I'm not around this man 
anymore,' " recalled shelter manager Miljean Stack, 48, an eight-year Rainbow 
veteran who talks of Pizano as if she had been her own daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pizano's adolescence seems to have been short-lived. Born in Mexico, she moved 
to Bakersfield in her early teens and soon became involved with Pablo Nevel. 
She was only 14 or 15 at the time, while he was in his late 30s. She spoke 
little English and did not finish high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think she thought he was going to give her a better life," said her sister, 
Consuelo Pizano, 23. "Or maybe she just fell in love." 
</P>
<P>
 During her 14 years with Nevel, Maria Pizano had three sons: Pablo Nevel Jr., 
13, Marco, 8, and Rodolfo, 7. Nevel eventually left his job as a nursery 
worker, disabled by diabetes and high blood pressure, and Pizano earned money 
picking fruit and packing carrots in the flat, sunbaked farmlands of the San 
Joaquin Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Exactly when -- and how -- the relationship began unraveling is difficult to 
pinpoint. Pizano's sisters say Nevel was hitting her several years ago, and 
then stopped but apparently continued to make threats. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day, he was getting jealouser of her," said Laura Pizano, 19, who says 
Nevel used to search her sister's purse and clothes when she came home from 
work. 
</P>
<P>
 Like many accounts of domestic problems, this one has its dissenters, and two 
of Nevel's daughters defend him as a kind, loving man. "He used to buy whatever 
she needed," said Nevel's daughter, Ofelia Gama, 25, who suspects Pizano really 
left Nevel because she was seeing a younger man. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizano had, in fact, grown close to a man at the packinghouse where she 
worked, according to family and friends. Still, they insist that her decision 
to leave Nevel sprang from her fear of violence. 
</P>
<P>
 Last spring, Pizano and the children vanished, and her sisters heard nothing 
from her for more than a week. When she finally called, it was from the Rainbow 
shelter 115 miles away in Los Angeles County. 
</P>
<P>
 With the help of shelter counselors, Pizano sought a restraining order, saying 
she left Nevel April 3 after he threatened her with a gun. Nevel countered in 
court documents that he never hit her, that she was leaving him for a younger 
man. His attorney, Raul C. Contreras, said his client consistently denied that 
he abused Pizano. 
</P>
<P>
 The restraining order restricted both parties from contact except when dealing 
with the children. Nevel was granted temporary visitation rights with the 
children pending a hearing this fall, a fact that still angers Consuelo Pizano. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he didn't see the kids," she said, "this never would have happened." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Pizano lived in hiding from early April to mid-May in a large South Bay house 
with three bedrooms crammed with bunk beds. Its windows are veiled with lace 
curtains and children's laughter rises from the back yard. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizano swiftly made herself at home. 
</P>
<P>
 "I care about them all the same, but she was just so out there, open, a spunky 
type of person who would make you like her," said Stack, the shelter manager. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizano made fresh flour tortillas for shelter workers and gave them flowers on 
Mother's Day. When one worker admired her earrings, she immediately pulled them 
off and handed them over. Soon she was calling the staff her second family. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rainbow shelter does have a familial flavor; a former resident once 
compared it to a sorority house. But despite the communal cooking and the 
relaxed evening gossip sessions around the television set, the shelter's 
mission is deadly serious. 
</P>
<P>
 Women arrive here from throughout California and beyond, some terrified, some 
nursing bruises or broken bones. They receive counseling and practical advice 
such as how to find a job, apply for welfare, obtain restraining orders and 
enroll in school. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, 82 women and 146 children were housed in the shelter, and hundreds 
more were turned away for lack of space. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizano had talked of going to school, improving her English and finding a job. 
But when she moved to an apartment near the shelter, her resourcefulness seemed 
to falter. 
</P>
<P>
 She filled the rooms with furniture donated by Rainbow and Stack took her 
shopping to stock the refrigerator. But with the boys in school, loneliness 
drew her back to the shelter almost daily. 
</P>
<P>
 Pizano's welfare benefits barely covered the rent, her friends and sisters 
say, and she missed her family. Finally, in early June, she moved north again 
and found work as a vineyard laborer at Dole Fresh Fruit. She did not return to 
Nevel and instead lived next door to her family, her sisters said. 
</P>
<P>
 She continued to call the shelter long distance and even telephoned workers at 
home. 
</P>
<P>
 In early August the three boys were visiting their father at his daughter's 
home when Nevel asked Pizano for fresh clothes for the children, her sisters 
said. That Sunday morning, she ironed some clothes and rushed off, her hair 
still unbrushed after a shower. 
</P>
<P>
 No one knows for sure how long Pizano and Nevel sat inside her car, which was 
parked at the curb. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevel's family grew alarmed when they glanced outside and saw the motionless 
figures, and someone called 911. The Kern County Sheriff's Department found 
Pizano slumped behind the steering wheel, with Nevel dead beside her, a 
revolver still grasped in his hand. Between them lay the children's clothes, 
soaked with blood. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Maria Acuna was working the Rainbow hot line alone that Sunday night when the 
call came in. She is accustomed to hearing from sobbing women, angry women, but 
nothing prepared her for the heart-stopping report from Pizano's sister. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was in shock, I felt so cold. I couldn't speak," Acuna said. 
</P>
<P>
 A woman arriving at the shelter the next day was told about the killing. She 
lay awake into the night, nervous that some client's angry husband would invade 
the house and start shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 Case manager Patricia Serna drove with another client to the Long Beach 
courthouse to sit in the conference room where she once sat with Pizano. For 
the first time, she felt frightened going to court. A car backfired as they 
left the courthouse and Serna felt a flash of cold fear. 
</P>
<P>
 Three women from Rainbow went to Pizano's funeral. They clustered together at 
the cemetery in 100-degree heat, watching silently as relatives sobbed aloud 
and a numb-looking Pablo Jr. helped shovel clods of dirt atop his mother's 
grave. 
</P>
<P>
 Nevel had been buried at the cemetery a day earlier, and his family, too, is 
devastated. His daughter Ofelia recalls how he had sunk into deep depression 
and loneliness after Pizano left him, questioning how he could live without 
her. 
</P>
<P>
 The staff at Rainbow decided they should tell those living at the shelter 
about the shooting so they would not find out about it through rumors. 
</P>
<P>
 Some heard the news at a support group meeting that included women still in 
abusive relationships. 
</P>
<P>
 Several women gasped, and one cried. "I'm afraid, after hearing about that 
lady," said one woman who had just left her husband. "This is a new world to 
me, and I feel lost." 
</P>
<P>
 Afterward, another woman vowed to leave her husband by Dec. 1. "If I stay in 
it," she said about her relationship, "he may be visiting me in the cemetery." 
</P>
<P>
 Since Pizano's death, Rainbow has started asking residents running errands to 
write down their destinations and when they will return. And Acuna feels new 
urgency when she warns women about being cautious when they leave for good. Do 
not go near their abusers, she urges. To those returning to live with an 
abusive partner, she says: "At the first sign of violence, leave again." 
</P>
<P>
 Some shelter workers say that in order to keep functioning, they cannot dwell 
on the fact that women do return to violent relationships and sometimes get 
killed. Instead, they attempt to keep a certain distance. 
</P>
<P>
 The Bakersfield shooting temporarily ruptured that protective shield, and now 
some staff members wonder if other former clients may have died, unheralded. 
Others worry about the short time that women can spend at the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 "We see just a slice of people's lives, just a piece of them. And then they go 
off," said Majka, who hopes Rainbow can someday start a longer-term shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 For many women, a 30-day shelter stay is not enough time to develop a new 
social network, job skills and a new source of income, said Richard Gelles, 
director of the Family Violence Research Program at the University of Rhode 
Island. Yet short-term shelters cannot afford to relax their rules because of 
the demand for services, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One possible solution: transitional programs, where women can stay with their 
children for six months or longer while they receive job training and other 
aid. But only two such programs are operating in the county, according to the 
Los Angeles County Domestic Violence Council. Although more beds are planned, 
experts say the number falls seriously short of the demand. 
</P>
<P>
 So the shelters cope as best they can. 
</P>
<P>
 A few days after Pizano died, Stack reached in her desk drawer and dug out a 
photo of a client who had come to Rainbow severely bruised years ago. The woman 
has since built a new life, and last spring she sent photos to the shelter. 
</P>
<P>
 Looking at her face gave Stack some solace, some hope. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet even now, the memory of Pizano remains in painfully sharp focus. 
</P>
<P>
 "We need help. We need more shelters. I don't know where we'll get them," 
Stack said, emphatic in her grief. 
</P>
<P>
 "This matters. A life is gone."

U.S., CUBA STILL AT IMPASSE AS TALKS RECESS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STANLEY MEISLER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 American and Cuban negotiators recessed their talks Friday without reaching 
agreement on a formula to shut off the flood of Cuban rafters heading toward 
the United States on the high seas. 
</P>
<P>
 State Department spokesman David Johnson, who had been describing the talks as 
"serious and businesslike" for two days, added as the talks broke up that they 
had been "candid" on Friday as well. Diplomats, in their jargon, usually employ 
that word to connote argumentative discussion. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson said that the talks at the offices of the Cuban Mission to the United 
Nations would resume at the U.S. mission Sunday afternoon. The talks began 
there Thursday morning. 
</P>
<P>
 The State Department spokesman said that the negotiations had reached the 
state where the main American proposal -- a guarantee of more than 20,000 legal 
visas a year for Cuban emigrants -- had been set down in writing for 
consideration by the Cuban delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 As Johnson put it, the Americans had presented their proposal for an 
"expanded, predictable, dependable, legal migration program from Cuba to the 
United States" in exchange for Cuban authorities taking action to prevent 
thousands of Cubans from setting off on their own without visas. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as the two delegations met, the Coast Guard continued to pick up Cuban 
refugees from the seas and take them to detention camps at the U.S. Guantanamo 
Bay Naval Base on the southeast Cuban coast. By late Friday, the Coast Guard 
had picked up 1,271 more Cuban refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 In various television interviews, Ricardo Alarcon, the former foreign minister 
who heads the Cuban delegation, has said that there is no point in dealing with 
the immigration issue without delving into what the Cuban government believes 
is the root cause -- the American trade embargo against Cuba. 
</P>
<P>
 But Clinton Administration officials insist that they are interested only in 
focusing on the immigration problem. That stance has been repeated by Michael 
Skol, the deputy assistant secretary of state who heads the American 
delegation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration strategy, as outlined by senior officials, is to offer the 
Cubans little more than the guarantee of 20,000 visas. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. officials believe that Cuban President Fidel Castro is so embarrassed 
by the exodus of Cubans that he would accept the offer as a face-saving way to 
stop it. According to this view, Castro does not mind the Cubans leaving as 
much as he minds the woeful images that come with their flight on makeshift 
rafts. 
</P>
<P>
 But Castro also knows that the exodus has been deeply embarrassing to 
President Clinton. Clinton, facing a clamor in Florida against a new flood of 
immigrants, changed a 35-year-old policy last month and stopped granting 
automatic residence to Cuban refugees. Instead, they are being detained in 
Guantanamo alongside camps holding Haitian refugees. 
</P>
<P>
 It was clear that the two delegations, after presenting their positions 
Thursday, sat down Friday to detail the proposals in writing and argue about 
them. Johnson described the Friday talks as "serious discussions," adding that 
"we gave each other concrete things to think about." 
</P>
<P>
 American and Cuban diplomats signed an agreement more than 10 years ago that 
set aside a maximum of 27,875 visas a year for Cubans who qualified. But U.S. 
officials have insisted that most Cuban applicants do not meet the requirements 
of U.S. immigration law and visas have been granted to only about 3,000 Cubans 
a year. 
</P>
<P>
 The American offer presumably would relax immigration requirements so that 
more Cubans would qualify. 
</P>
<P>
 In the latest talks, the Americans said that they also were bringing up the 
repatriation of several thousand criminals who were freed from Cuban jails by 
Castro in 1980 so that they could come to the United States in the Mariel boat 
lift. 
</P>
<P>
 There have been reports, denied by Cuban officials, that the rafters include 
criminals as well. And, State Department spokeswoman Christine Shelly told 
reporters in Washington that the Administration had received such assurances 
from the Havana government "in a way that had credibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Scores of Cuban exiles crowded behind police lines near the Cuban mission 
Friday, shouting slogans at the mission and each other. One group of exiles 
shouted its approval of the Cuban embargo while a second group demanded its 
removal. 
</P>
<P>
 While the two groups were separated by police, an anti-Castro demonstrator 
managed to slip away and a scuffle broke out between him and a cluster of 
anti-embargo demonstrators. Police stopped the fight and arrested two of the 
exiles.

U.S. TO STEP UP PRESSURE ON HAITI; CARIBBEAN: WASHINGTON MAKES MOVES TOWARD 
INVASION IN BID TO SHOW REGIME CLINTON IS NOT BLUFFING. DEADLINE WEIGHED AS 
PART OF 'BRINKMANSHIP' CAMPAIGN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Clinton Administration plans military and diplomatic actions over the next 
few weeks -- including new movements of U.S. troops into the Caribbean and a 
possible speech by President Clinton -- to ensure that Haiti's military rulers 
get the message that Clinton is serious about invading their nation if they do 
not step down, officials said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of a concerted campaign of combined psychological warfare and 
political signals, U.S. Navy ships and other forces are being readied to move 
closer to Haiti. U.S. warplanes will increase their window-rattling flights 
over the island. And 266 Caribbean troops are heading for some well-publicized 
training on a U.S. base in nearby Puerto Rico. 
</P>
<P>
 On the non-military side, Clinton aides are planning statements by the 
President to seek public and congressional support for an invasion. The 
Administration has asked leaders in other countries, like Dominican Republic 
President Joaquin Balaguer, to tell the Haitians that the United States is not 
bluffing this time. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton is also seriously considering setting a formal deadline for the 
Haitians to step down and sending a last-ditch diplomatic mission to deliver 
the message -- just as President George Bush did to Iraq before the 1991 
Persian Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
 The Administration already has warned the Haitian regime that a major massacre 
of its domestic opponents or any attack on U.S. citizens in Haiti could touch 
off immediate U.S. military action. 
</P>
<P>
 Taken together, the Administration's actions add up to a classic exercise in 
brinkmanship: moving its forces to the point of an invasion to increase the 
chance that Haiti's rulers might blink. 
</P>
<P>
 "We still hope the Haitian military regime will get the message and allow us 
to resolve this thing without using force," said one official involved in Haiti 
policy. "Until now, they never got the message. They always focused on the 
factors that weren't in place yet and the conflicting signals coming out of 
Washington that suggested that we might not be serious. 
</P>
<P>
 "The signal they have been waiting for is now there: concrete steps that 
require the international community and the different agencies of the U.S. 
government to cooperate," he said. "That is beginning to happen and they are 
going to see more of it." 
</P>
<P>
 This week, the Administration stepped up its rhetoric on Haiti, with Deputy 
Defense Secretary John Deutch publicly declaring: "The time for action has 
arrived. . . . There can be no doubt in anybody's mind that the (U.S.-led) 
multinational force is going to Haiti." 
</P>
<P>
 As important as Deutch's message, officials said, was the position of the 
person delivering it -- a top official from the Pentagon. Until this week, 
Defense Secretary William J. Perry had been a leading voice warning of the 
perils of an invasion of Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 For the first time, the Haitians see the State and Defense departments 
"singing from the same hymnbook," one official said. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, the Administration collected two important new pieces of 
international backing for military action. 
</P>
<P>
 Deutch and Deputy Secretary of State Strobe Talbott won commitments from 
Caribbean countries, including Jamaica, Belize and Trinidad and Tobago, for 
troops in an invasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Their offer of 266 soldiers in rear-echelon units was little more than 
symbolic, but it provided the Administration with much-desired evidence that 
the United States would not be alone in supporting military action. 
</P>
<P>
 Second, U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali privately reported that 
he has received commitments from 10 countries to provide at least 2,000 troops 
for a U.N. peacekeeping force that would follow an invasion -- the bare minimum 
needed. The foreign troops would combine with 2,000 U.S. troops, U.N. officials 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The increasingly detailed preparations suggest, just as officials intended, 
that Clinton is moving steadily closer to a decision to invade Haiti if Lt. 
Gen. Raoul Cedras and his fellow military rulers do not step down. 
</P>
<P>
 But they also suggest that it will take roughly a month before all the desired 
preliminary steps have been taken. The training of the 266 Caribbean troops, 
for example, has yet to start and will take at least four weeks to complete. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're not expecting to see any real military operations for several more 
weeks," said a Pentagon official familiar with the Administration's strategy. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Administration officials said that they believe the Haitian leaders may 
be vulnerable to the kind of steady escalation in pressure that they plan. 
</P>
<P>
 The success of the Administration strategy depends on Clinton's ability to 
convey the message that he is serious about invading -- the essence of what 
became known in the Cold War as "brinkmanship." 
</P>
<P>
 John Foster Dulles, President Dwight D. Eisenhower's secretary of state, was 
credited with inventing the term when he said, speaking of U.S. confrontations 
with the Soviet Union, "The ability to get to the verge without getting into 
the war is the necessary art." 
</P>
<P>
 In this instance of brinkmanship, officials noted, the Administration suffers 
from one major handicap but also enjoys one major advantage. 
</P>
<P>
 The handicap is that Clinton has won a reputation, fairly or not, for 
indecision, including over what to do in Haiti. 
</P>
<P>
 The Haitians "have always doubted our commitment, and they have had some 
reason," one official said. As a result, he said, the Haitians may not 
recognize that Clinton and his aides really are serious -- and thus force the 
United States to go over the brink and invade. 
</P>
<P>
 The advantage, on the other hand, is that an invasion of Haiti, with its 
ramshackle army of about 7,000 troops and no functioning air force or navy, 
poses no danger of seriously daunting U.S. casualties. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've tried everything else," one official said glumly. "This is the only 
option we have left." 
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, "it's beginning to look almost inevitable."

LIVERMORE'S HOPE FOR GIANT LASER IGNITES PROTESTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RALPH VARTABEDIAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ideological and political battles over nuclear weapon research were presumed 
as dead as the arms race, but bomb designers and arms control advocates are 
facing off yet again over a massive weapon project at Lawrence Livermore 
National Laboratory. 
</P>
<P>
 The lab, east of San Francisco, wants to build a laser the size of a football 
stadium. The multibillion-dollar machine would deliver a wallop of light energy 
powerful enough to trigger nuclear fusion, generating temperatures five times 
higher than exist in the core of the sun. 
</P>
<P>
 Livermore scientists say the laser, which would be among the biggest defense 
or energy projects of the next decade, is crucial for maintaining their 
proficiency in hydrogen bomb physics in an era when the United States will be 
neither testing nor producing nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 And California politicians like it for an altogether different reason. With an 
initial price tag of $1 billion and an operating budget of $4 billion over the 
life of the project, the laser promises to keep federal dollars flowing to 
Livermore and bolster the California economy. 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents say the project, known as the National Ignition Facility, will 
undermine the current moratorium on nuclear weapon tests, amounting to a form 
of surrogate testing that no other nation has the technical capability to 
equal. They also criticize it as a pork-barrel project that will further 
pollute the environment around Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's large. It's controversial," admits Victor Reese, assistant secretary of 
energy for nuclear weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 The decision on whether to build the laser will be crucial in determining the 
size and scope of the U.S. nuclear weapon complex, which is undergoing a 
piecemeal consolidation in the aftermath of the Cold War. And the heated debate 
over the project mirrors a broad uncertainty over what should be done to 
maintain the nation's nuclear capability. 
</P>
<P>
 The two camps are maneuvering furiously as Energy Secretary Hazel O'Leary 
weighs whether to go ahead with the project. Approval of the laser was delayed 
this summer after two key California congressmen -- House Armed Services 
Committee Chairman Ronald V. Dellums (D-Oakland) and Rep. Pete Stark 
(D-Hayward) -- broke with their California colleagues and withdrew their 
support. 
</P>
<P>
 For the nuclear weapon fraternity, the stakes could hardly be higher. Many 
defense officials and scientists worry that the United States is allowing its 
nuclear capabilities to erode too quickly, and the laser would be a major 
engineering tool that could help reverse that trend and keep dozens of bomb 
designers busy for the next decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Proponents say that it is vital to maintaining the safety and reliability of 
the existing U.S. nuclear weapon stockpile even if another bomb is never built. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, the laser could help save Livermore itself as a center for nuclear 
weapon research. As the Energy Department copes with budget cutbacks, one 
option under consideration is consolidating all weapon work at one lab -- 
probably Los Alamos National Laboratory in New Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently, both Livermore and Los Alamos conduct research on the nuclear 
packages for bombs, but Livermore is considered more vulnerable if a decision 
is made to have just one lab. The Energy Department could decide to build the 
laser in another state if it chooses to end nuclear weapon work at Livermore. 
</P>
<P>
 Livermore claims world leadership in the area of high energy lasers. And 
without the National Ignition Facility, Livermore scientists say their 
unparalleled expertise in hydrogen bomb fusion will atrophy. 
</P>
<P>
 While acknowledging that the primary justification for the new laser is 
nuclear weapon work, Mike Campbell, Livermore's chief for laser programs, says 
it would also be used for research on fusion as a source of electrical energy 
and in astrophysics. 
</P>
<P>
 "This allows us to keep smart people engaged in relevant physics," Campbell 
said. "Some people are opposed to that." 
</P>
<P>
 Campbell contends that large machinery like the new laser is necessary for the 
United States to continue its leadership in the discipline, since Europe and 
Japan also have fusion programs. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is an important area to be pursuing," agreed Sidney Drell, an influential 
physicist at the Stanford Linear Accelerator. Drell recently completed a study 
of high energy physics for Energy Secretary O'Leary. "It is good physics, and 
it is very good people doing it." 
</P>
<P>
 But opponents of the laser -- ranging from influential Washington arms-control 
lobbyists to local environmentalists -- regard it as a misguided effort that 
will be a waste of money and a polluting, destabilizing continuation of the 
arms race. 
</P>
<P>
 Arms control advocates say the facility will allow the United States to comply 
with the letter but not the spirit of efforts to end all nuclear testing. 
</P>
<P>
 "The idea (of the Livermore scientists) is to maintain the same range of 
nuclear weapons design skills that we had during the Cold War," said 
Christopher Payne, a critic at the National Resources Defense Council, a 
Washington environmental group. "They don't get it. The Cold War is over. We 
are negotiating a test ban so we don't have to do this anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 The United States has agreed to a moratorium on all nuclear weapon tests, and 
efforts are under way to negotiate a comprehensive ban by next year, when an 
earlier treaty expires. The rationale underlying a test moratorium is to 
prevent proliferation of nuclear weapons and promote nuclear disengagement by 
established powers. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the laser, the United States is considering whether to conduct 
underground tests that produce very small explosions, equivalent to less than 
100 pounds of TNT. The tests, known as hydro-nuclear tests, are considered 
important for bomb safety, particularly resistance to accidental detonation. 
</P>
<P>
 But both the laser and the hydro-nuclear tests have prompted concern that 
other nations will perceive that America is using its superior technology and 
financial capability to conduct a full range of experiments that simulate a 
nuclear detonation -- even though a fully assembled bomb is not tested. 
</P>
<P>
 Environmentalists have another set of concerns. A study by Livermore itself 
disclosed that wines produced from local grapes have three times the level of 
tritium -- a radioactive form of hydrogen -- as wines from Napa Valley, said 
Marylia Kelly, president of Tri-Valley Cares, an environmental group. 
</P>
<P>
 Livermore officials don't dispute that some tritium has escaped over the years 
and found its way into the environment, but they contend that the wine with 
elevated tritium meets all federal safety standards for drinking water by a 
huge margin and that a single airplane trip can expose passengers to a greater 
radiation dose. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, the new laser will have better shielding and environmental 
safeguards than other high-power lasers at the one-square-mile Livermore lab. 
In addition, Livermore has significantly reduced the amount of tritium stored 
at the site. 
</P>
<P>
 But laser opponents have managed to at least stall a decision. After lobbying 
by arms-control and environmental advocates, Rep. Dellums tempered his support 
of the National Ignition Facility, asserting in a letter to O'Leary that the 
issues require far greater research before launching into the next phase of the 
program. 
</P>
<P>
 Rep. Stark also withdrew his support, saying the laser will be too expensive 
and will send the wrong message about nuclear weapons to the rest of the world. 
As a result of the congressional concerns, O'Leary instructed subordinates in 
July to answer a lengthy set of questions about the uses of the laser and its 
implications for proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 Defense proponents dispute the idea that efforts to keep the U.S. nuclear 
stockpile safe and reliable contribute to proliferation. 
</P>
<P>
 "People who want to have their own nuclear capability will find excuses," said 
former Defense Secretary Harold Brown. "If it isn't this one, it will be 
another one." 
</P>
<P>
 Although the Pentagon is reviewing its nuclear weapon strategy, there is no 
doubt that the weapons will have a significant role in the future U.S. defense 
posture. Experts estimate that America will retain about 6,000 nuclear bombs 
over the long term. 
</P>
<P>
 Without major new investments in instruments and computers, Livermore 
scientists say they will not be able to guarantee the safety and reliability of 
those bombs. But critics, such as Spurgeon Keeny, president of the Arms Control 
Assn., say the laser is a "Rolls-Royce" approach to the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 The laser would have 192 individual beams, amplified by glass lenses in a 
labyrinth of tubes, aimed into a spherical test chamber made of four-inch-thick 
aluminum. At the center of all the beams, scientists would mount a tiny target 
of super-cold deuterium and tritium, heavy forms of hydrogen. Just four 
10-millionths of a pound of fuel is used. 
</P>
<P>
 The laser beam ignites the fuel indirectly by focusing the beams inside a 
small gold chamber, called a hohlraum. The hohlraum instantly vaporizes, 
barraging the fuel with X-rays. The temperature rises to 50 million degrees, 
and a sustained fusion of atoms occurs that can raise the temperature up to 400 
million degrees. 
</P>
<P>
 The laser would represent a second approach to controlled fusion, the other 
being magnetic confinement inside machines called tokamaks. Magnetic fusion has 
been more lavishly funded, but there is little agreement that it represents the 
only solution. 
</P>
<P>
 The National Ignition Facility would not really confine the fusion. Ignition 
would occur instantly before the target mass could fly apart and for that 
reason, the technology is known as inertial confinement fusion. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike past generations of lasers, the fusion in the new laser is intended to 
produce more energy than it consumes. Campbell said he is confident but not 
absolutely certain that the laser will meet that objective. 
</P>
<P>
 With 1.8 megajoules of power, a measurement of energy used by physicists, it 
will have a significant margin over the 1 megajoule that Campbell believes is 
sufficient for ignition. 
</P>
<P>
 But scientists at Livermore have been wrong before. The Nova laser at 
Livermore was expected to achieve ignition when it began operation in the 
1980s, but it proved to be underpowered. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, how the laser would actually help ensure the safety and reliability 
of hydrogen bombs is disputed. In a thermonuclear warhead, a plutonium sphere 
is imploded to create a fission reaction, which in turn produces high 
temperatures and large amounts of X-rays. Those X-rays are reflected by an 
interior shroud to a second sphere that contains the fusion fuel, producing a 
much larger explosion. 
</P>
<P>
 The design is similar to the hohlraum that would be used in the Livermore 
laser. Assistant Energy Secretary Reese said the laser would be used to refine 
top secret computational codes used to design and predict the yield of nuclear 
weapons. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a scientific tool that allows you to understand the physics of fusion . 
. . and really to understand what happens at very high energy and energy 
density, which allows you to work on the codes," Reese said. 
</P>
<P>
 But critics, such as Payne, say the laser is little more than an expensive toy 
for physicists. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think we will forget how to make nuclear weapons in the next 100 
years," Payne said. "It only took us three years to make them the first time." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, as California politicians such as Dellums waffle over their support 
for the laser, officials from Nevada and New Mexico have launched efforts to 
get the program for their states. The political moves have left Livermore 
officials clearly worried, not only that they would lose the laser but also 
that they would lose the lab's role in bomb research itself. 
</P>
<P>
 "The National Ignition Facility," said one scientist, "is crucial to 
Livermore."

COLUMN ONE; SHOWDOWN IN THE NEW WEST; THE HOTLY FOUGHT MONTANA SENATE RACE WILL 
TEST THE IMPACT OF DROVES OF NEWCOMERS ON A REGION LONG RULED BY 
RESOURCE-HUNGRY BUSINESSES AND CONSERVATIVE POLITICS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Bob Schumann considers himself a conservative who usually votes Republican. 
But he is GOP Sen. Conrad Burns' worst political nightmare. 
</P>
<P>
 A retired attorney who looks like a cross between Ralph Lauren and Ernest 
Hemingway, Schumann is a foot soldier in the swelling ranks of newcomers on the 
march throughout the West. He fled the crowds and grime of northern New Jersey 
for the big sky and sparkling trout streams of Montana seven years ago, and has 
never looked back. He is part of an army carrying the potent germ of change. 
</P>
<P>
 Full of environmental fervor, Schumann built a lakeside cabin from logs 
harvested after a forest fire in Idaho -- part of his commitment to practices 
that protect national forests from clear-cutting. He wants reforms in mining 
and grazing laws on federal lands and hopes relentless development in his new 
home, spectacular Flathead County, can be curbed. 
</P>
<P>
 "The old West, they just didn't pay much attention to what you cut down or dug 
up, because there was always somewhere else to cut things down or dig things 
up," Schumann said. "But this is the new West. They just can't do it that way 
anymore." 
</P>
<P>
 Environment-minded transplants like Schumann are arriving in droves throughout 
the West, transforming the social, economic -- and political -- landscape. 
</P>
<P>
 Their determination to protect the region's beauty has put them at odds with 
the loggers, miners and cowboys who have long made their living from the land. 
The newcomers are challenging the interests of the so-called extractive 
industries, which use resources like forests, grasslands, minerals and water -- 
most on federal land -- to produce goods ranging from beef to gold. 
</P>
<P>
 And therein lies the problem for Burns, a freshman senator who has championed 
the business interests against efforts by the Clinton Administration to rein 
them in. He is facing a stiff challenge this November from Democrat Jack Mudd, 
an attorney who has assumed the environmentalists' mantle. 
</P>
<P>
 The race is widely seen as a barometer of how firmly the new order of the West 
is taking hold and whether Western voters, facing economic and social 
dislocations, will act to extend environmental protections or relax them out of 
fear of losing jobs. 
</P>
<P>
 In Montana, the wave of newcomers has arrived in the midst of a slump in the 
natural resources industries, and the standoff between the two forces is as 
dramatic as any in the West. The Mudd-Burns race, in short, comes at high noon 
in a highly polarized state. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographers mark 1980 as the start of the latest stampede west, although 
migration to Montana has picked up steam only in the past four years. In the 
1980s, 2.3 million people poured into Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, 
Nevada, New Mexico, Utah and Wyoming, making the "Mountain Division" the 
nation's second-fastest-growing region behind the Pacific states. While 
Montana's overall population growth was a relatively low 1.6% between 1980 and 
1990, it has taken off in the 1990s, growing by almost 3% from 1990 to 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 As newcomers have arrived, jobs in the retail, service, finance, insurance and 
real estate sectors have exploded. Mining, logging and agricultural jobs have 
lost substantial ground. 
</P>
<P>
 And once-sleepy outposts like Missoula, Bozeman, Kalispell and Billings have 
swelled with transplants from urban California, the Midwest and the East. Where 
once the Marlboro Man reigned, "fax rangers" and "cappuccino cowboys" roam. 
</P>
<P>
 In Kalispell, historically a logging town in northwest Montana, trucks 
peddling caffe latte, bagels and biscotti roll up twice a day to Mac's Place, a 
sleekly housed computer mail-order business that arrived last October from the 
suburbs of Seattle. Robert Wilkins, the 32-year-old president, employs up to 
200 workers in an area reeling from timber industry layoffs. He says he was 
drawn to Kalispell not only by low business costs but by the blue-ribbon trout 
streams and open spaces. 
</P>
<P>
 "The environment is really important to me -- that it be stable and balanced," 
said Wilkins, as computers hummed in the background. "I believe in the logging 
industry but we need stricter rules on how it's handled. . . . I don't believe 
in cutting old-growth forests." 
</P>
<P>
 Wilkins and other newcomers have brought an environmental outlook considerably 
more progressive than that of most natives. Pollster Celinda Lake, who has 
surveyed much of the West for Democratic candidates, observed that among 
newcomers support for stricter environmental protections runs more than 20 
points ahead of support from natives. 
</P>
<P>
 Demographers estimate that throughout the non-Pacific West 40% of residents 
came from other states. As a major new voting bloc with measurably stronger 
views about environmental protection, their views represent substantial new 
political clout. 
</P>
<P>
 They have been a major force for stiffening state environmental laws that 
protect rare species, govern mining operations and protect forests, wetlands 
and bodies of water. Their impact on gubernatorial elections has been 
considered powerful, ushering in a cohort of Western governors with 
comparatively forceful pro-environment views. More slowly, say political 
observers, they are changing the political complexion of the lawmakers they 
send to Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the environmental fervor has spread to native Montanans like 
36-year-old Tom Maclay, who ranches outside Missoula, and Jeff Capps, a retired 
Army officer who opened a shop selling bird feeders in Bigfork. 
</P>
<P>
 "They call this the last, best place. That's a warning, in my mind," said 
Capps, who grew up in Great Falls, left to pursue a 20-year Army career and 
returned in May. "Where are you going to go if you mess this place up?" 
</P>
<P>
 Maclay, a Mudd supporter from a staunchly Republican family, is experimenting 
with grazing techniques that are gentler on the earth. He supports the federal 
government's efforts to reform the rules under which ranchers graze sheep and 
cattle on public land, and raises oats for a genetic engineering firm in 
Missoula that aims to develop safer, more natural pesticides. Burns, Maclay 
said, "is not where Montana is now." 
</P>
<P>
 And when it comes to environmental matters, he added, the senator appears to 
prefer "fanning the flames" of discord between environmentalists and displaced 
industries rather than helping find common ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns appears to be highly vulnerable in the coming election. In a recent 
survey of senators' favorability ratings, 33% of Montanans said they approved 
of his performance, the lowest showing of 33 senators up for reelection in 
1994. 
</P>
<P>
 But Burns is not without support. Despite its growth, Montana has only 822,000 
people -- most of whom expect to know their senator personally. And Burns, who 
drives a van with 170,000 miles on its odometer and a seat-back propped up with 
a 2-by-4, is an assiduous campaigner with a common touch and a crack 
constituency-service organization. 
</P>
<P>
 In the Senate, he has carved out a niche handling legislation on 
telecommunications -- a high-tech specialty important to the state's growing 
service industries. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns' support runs especially strong in the rural eastern part of the state, 
where irrigated agriculture dominates, and in areas like Flathead County, where 
the decline of the logging industry has left many jobless. Ray Brandewie, a 
54-year-old farmer in Flathead County, called Burns "a Montana 
environmentalist" who "represents all the interests of Montana." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 A slim, soft-spoken hiker, the 50-year-old Mudd could hardly stand in greater 
contrast to the tobacco-chewing Burns, 59, who got his start in Montana as a 
livestock fieldman and auctioneer. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns, alternately folksy and fiery, has insisted that "Mother Earth heals 
herself" and has railed against the environmentalism of "elitists" who "would 
erode a whole way of life so they can wear their silver-tipped cowboy boots." 
</P>
<P>
 Mudd has declared that newcomers will strengthen Montana, not only with new 
jobs and money, but because "they remind us that we can't take the environment 
we have here for granted." 
</P>
<P>
 As a senator, Mudd said, he would support some measure of mining and grazing 
reform, as well as large new tracts of wilderness in Montana. But he added that 
he would use his background as a mediator to help develop compromises between 
environmentalists and opponents of further federal regulation. "Rhetoric 
usually draws people further apart, whether you're Israel and Jordan or a 
logger and member of the Sierra Club," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In Montana, as throughout the region, Mudd's gospel of compromise is a tough 
sell these days. Communities are suffering not only growing pains but the loss 
of jobs in industries that have long defined the rough-riding West. In such 
places, the so-called "wise use" movement -- a loose coalition of industries 
and the residents dependent on them -- is a powerful force opposing more 
restrictive environmental regulation, including limits on logging and mining. 
</P>
<P>
 "Conrad Burns appeals to the fear in people here. And Jack Mudd appeals more 
to their hopes," said Marc Wilson, publisher and editor of the Bigfork Eagle. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mudd is more of a new West politician and, if people are optimistic about the 
economy and the state in this 'new West,' he'll have a chance in this 
election," Wilson added. "But if people are fearful (that) their land is being 
tied up and the federal government and people back east are going to deprive 
them of a way to make a living in this 'new West,' they're going to vote for 
Conrad Burns." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, many who work in extraction industries in places like Montana have 
much to fear. They face a welter of federal environmental reforms that likely 
would curb their operations, cut their profits and trim their employment rolls 
even more deeply than they have been trimmed in recent years. As a result, 
industry representatives have opposed new laws sought by environmentalists and 
often by the Clinton Administration. And they have found an ardent defender in 
Burns. 
</P>
<P>
 Burns, with several other Western senators, has opposed the reform of 
regulations governing the grazing of livestock on federal lands. He has 
defended an 1872 law that has allowed mining operations on public lands, often 
with disastrous environmental consequences. On the campaign trail, Burns is 
charging that Clinton and environmentalists are waging a "war on the West" by 
pressing for stricter environmental protections. 
</P>
<P>
 It is on the issue of wilderness protection for huge tracts of Montana that 
Burns has taken his most visible stand in the environmental debate. Montana's 
Democratic representatives, Rep. Pat Williams and Sen. Max Baucus, have backed 
a bill that would set aside 1.7 million acres of Montana for designation as 
wilderness. But Burns has countered with what he calls the Montana Jobs 
Security and Lands Protection Act, under which 800,000 acres would be 
protected, as wilderness, from development. Major timber companies had a major 
role in writing the bill, and Burns' office referred early inquiries to 
industry representatives. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're a resource-based economy, period," Burns said flatly during a recent 
campaign swing through the state. ". . . That's what'll pay for our roads and 
our schools." 
</P>
<P>
 But Burns' critics question his unshakable faith in that social and economic 
order, arguing that the new Montana -- like the new West they see emerging -- 
will have a different and more evenly balanced constellation of interests -- 
and different politics to match. 
</P>
<P>
 "Burns is placing his chips on a particular segment of the community and I 
suspect he may not be reading the state of Montana accurately," said Democratic 
state legislator Emily Swanson, who settled in Bozeman from Colorado in the 
mid-1970s. He is making "too big a play" for the support of those who believe 
that the only way to protect jobs is to relax environmental strictures, Swanson 
added. "That may be his Achilles' heel." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Burns-Mudd faceoff is only one of many that will help define the political 
contours of the changing West. Outside of Montana, environmentalists are 
watching several races to gauge whether the long-term trend toward 
environmentalism is emerging in national politics. 
</P>
<P>
 One key Senate race is in Arizona, the West's third-most rapidly growing 
state, where Democrat Dennis DeConcini is retiring. While primary votes have 
yet to be taken, Republican Rep. Jon Kyl, whose environmental voting record won 
him a 0 (lowest on a scale of 0-100) from the League of Conservation Voters, is 
expected to face Democratic Rep. Sam Coppersmith, who last year scored 90. 
</P>
<P>
 Wyoming, where towns like Cheyenne have become cities during the rapid growth 
of the 1980s, also has a Senate race that many observers say pits old against 
new. With the retirement of Republican Malcolm Wallop, who scored a 6 last 
year, Democratic Gov. Mike Sullivan is facing off against the state's sole 
congressman, Republican Craig Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Thomas has won a 0 rating from the League of Conservation Voters. Sullivan has 
sought to diversify the state's economy and raise fees on mining companies 
extracting minerals from state-owned lands. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the polling data, political change at the congressional level lags 
well behind the West's seismic demographic shifts, said Jim Maddy, president of 
the League of Conservation Voters. But Maddy and other political activists 
point to early indicators that the new West is starting to take hold 
politically: They note that some of the fastest-growing cities, including Salt 
Lake City, Phoenix and Flagstaff, Ariz., have begun electing some of Congress' 
most ardent environmentalists -- Democrats Karan English of Flagstaff and Karen 
Shepherd of Salt Lake City. Other boom towns like Santa Fe, N.M., and Boise, 
Ida., are sending representatives to Washington who are much "greener" than 
their predecessors. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1980, when the league began tracking congressional delegations by 
region, the average environmental score for lawmakers in the most urban Western 
region (the Pacific states including Alaska and Hawaii), drifted from 45 to 56 
in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rapidly growing Southwest (Arizona, New Mexico, Texas and Oklahoma), 
scores rose from an average of 28 to 41. The Rocky Mountain West, where the 
flood of transplants is more recent, inched from 33 to 34. Translation: Western 
politicians, apparently reflecting an increasingly green electorate, are 
getting greener themselves. 
</P>
<P>
 But nowhere is effecting such change more difficult than in Senate races, 
where critics say that six-year terms and costly statewide races insulate many 
lawmakers from changes among their constituents. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents are more likely than challengers to receive substantial 
contributions from political action committees, organized by established 
home-state industrial interests. As a result, they sometimes fail to appreciate 
the growing economic and political significance of upstarts like Bob Schumann 
and Robert Wilkins. 
</P>
<P>
 Those who believe they are watching the birth of a new West contend that 
demographics will help sweep away the forces that are protecting the old West's 
political order. 
</P>
<P>
 "It will go in fits and starts," said Rep. George Miller (D-Martinez), who 
recently explored the new West's social, political and economic contours in a 
hearing in Salt Lake City. "But this transition is irreversible."

ENVIRONMENT; RED ARMY LEAVES BIG MESS BEHIND 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY WILLIAMS WALSH, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 When the last trainload of Red Army troops rolled across the Polish border 
from Germany on Thursday, the Russians left unanswered a major question: what 
to do with all the vacated real estate -- 1,026 scattered tracts of land 
totaling 667,000 acres, pocked with tumbledown buildings, toxic dumps and many 
thousands of unexploded artillery shells? 
</P>
<P>
 Germany was studying this dubious windfall even before the Russians boarded 
their trains home. In the last three years, Bonn spent $700 million just to 
keep the ground water safe. And now, after inspecting 925 former Red Army 
posts, officials have turned up 24,000 assorted environmental hot spots -- 
anything from oil spill sites to haphazard caches of chemicals. 
</P>
<P>
 About 3,000 of these locations are said to pose "acute danger" to the 
surrounding population. 
</P>
<P>
 And then there's the unspent ammunition. 
</P>
<P>
 "The Russian, in my experience, goes about the decommissioning of ammunition 
according to the principle of 'ocular isolation,' " complains Guenter Knueppel, 
a forestry official in Colbitz-Letzlinger Heide, a flatlands area where the 
Warsaw Pact forces used to stage major maneuvers twice a year. "He digs a hole 
in the ground, and if he doesn't see the ammunition anymore, it's gone." 
</P>
<P>
 German officials say any serious cleanup will cost billions of marks. And who 
has that kind of money? Certainly not private investors, as state and local 
governments in the former East Germany have discovered, to their chagrin. They 
had hoped that private developers might turn some of the former Russian bases 
into resorts, industrial parks, low-income housing estates, theme parks and 
nature preserves. But in most cases, the potential cost has proven too 
forbidding and the land too far removed from population centers for economic 
viability. 
</P>
<P>
 And so it has come to pass that the most enthusiastic prospective occupant for 
the Russian lands is the German army, which sees an opportunity to expand its 
own assets. 
</P>
<P>
 Already, the army is reclaiming 12 Russian training grounds, totaling 355,000 
acres, for training purposes. One 55-square-mile MIG bombing range northeast of 
Berlin, known as Wittstocker Heide, is now used by the Luftwaffe for practicing 
tactical air strikes, ground-support sorties and other maneuvers. 
</P>
<P>
 This doesn't sit well with the neighbors. For decades, East Germans put up 
with the roar of Red Army tank columns and the shriek of low-flying jet 
fighters, and now they wonder why they should accept more of the same from 
their own forces. 
</P>
<P>
 "People are really embittered," says Reinhard Lampe, a Protestant minister in 
the village of Dorf Zechlin, which lies on the edge of Wittstocker Heide. "The 
Russians never asked anybody whether they could do this or not. Now the German 
army has just taken over, using Stalin's methods." 
</P>
<P>
 Angry Germans have responded to the army's arrival with candlelight vigils, 
road blockades, petitions, a "Woodstock for Wittstock" concert and even 
threats. 
</P>
<P>
 These tactics have proved futile, however, and now the opponents have turned 
to the German judiciary, filing land claims and trying to win court orders to 
protect the ground water or to have some bases set aside as cultural heritage 
sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Most recently, the army planted the flag atop the 89-square-mile 
Colbitz-Letzlinger Heide, where it plans to build a high-tech center for tank 
maneuvers and laser-simulated target practice. 
</P>
<P>
 But state officials for Saxony-Anhalt argue that 45 years of Soviet and Warsaw 
Pact environmental insult have left the ground water at risk. 
</P>
<P>
 No problem, said the army. It would bring federal funds to clear away the 
Russians' mess. The army estimated that a cleanup would cost $100 million to 
$200 million. 
</P>
<P>
 State officials argued that a proper job would cost $900 million and entered 
talks with their federal counterparts. 
</P>
<P>
 On the very day of the talks, the army moved onto the base.

SAFETY CONCERNS LEAD U.S. TO BAR AIRLINES OF 9 COUNTRIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT L. JACKSON, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Citing concerns about passenger safety, federal officials Friday barred the 
airlines of nine Latin American and African countries from operating to or from 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Transportation Secretary Federico Pena said a three-year investigation by U.S. 
officials showed that aviation regulations of the nine countries are too lax to 
guarantee acceptable pilot training and aircraft maintenance. The airlines of 
four other nations have received conditional approval to continue operations 
with heightened U.S. surveillance, Pena said. 
</P>
<P>
 The nine countries that have not met international safety standards are the 
Dominican Republic, Belize, Honduras, Nicaragua, Paraguay, Uruguay, Gambia, 
Ghana and Zaire. 
</P>
<P>
 The four nations with conditional approval are Bolivia, Netherlands Antilles, 
El Salvador and Guatemala, officials said. Inspectors from the Federal Aviation 
Administration will monitor the crew training, aircraft maintenance and general 
operations of those airlines. 
</P>
<P>
 Referring to the nine countries with unacceptable standards, Pena told a news 
briefing that "no airline whose oversight is provided by (those countries) is 
allowed to operate in the United States." 
</P>
<P>
 However, all those nations except Gambia, Ghana and Zaire will be permitted to 
continue operating some flights under so-called "wet leases." With those 
leases, the entire operation is overseen under contract by the United States or 
another nation that has approved aviation standards. 
</P>
<P>
 Pena stressed that rejection of a country's regulations and inspection 
standards does not necessarily mean that its airlines are unsafe. But he 
suggested that "travelers should consider using U.S.-flagged carriers and 
carriers of other countries that have adequate civil aviation safety 
oversight." 
</P>
<P>
 Neither Russia nor China was on the banned list, despite news reports of poor 
safety records by Aeroflot and Air China in recent years. Pena said that 
neither was among 30 nations that so far have been evaluated by the FAA. He 
said that U.S. officials are "beginning to provide some assistance" to both 
countries and that final assessments could be completed later this year. 
</P>
<P>
 By 1997 the safety standards and regulations of all 93 countries that fly into 
and out of the United States will be evaluated, Pena said. Nearly half of all 
arriving and departing passengers between the United States and other parts of 
the world travel on foreign carriers. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. officials began examining the air safety systems of other nations after 
an Avianca Airlines plane from Colombia ran out of fuel and crashed in New York 
in 1990 but the FAA's assessments had been kept confidential. Consumer 
organizations prodded the Clinton Administration to make them public, leading 
to Friday's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials have found no problems with the air safety systems of European 
nations. In addition, the Transportation Department listed 17 other countries 
that adhere to international standards: Argentina, the Bahamas, Bangladesh, 
Brazil, Bulgaria, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Guyana, the Marshall Islands, 
Mexico, the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States, Oman, Panama, Peru, 
Ukraine and Venezuela. 
</P>
<P>
 The Eastern Caribbean group includes Antigua and Barbuda, St. Kitts and Nevis, 
St. Vincent and the Grenadines, Dominica, St. Lucia, Montserrat, Grenada and 
Anguilla. 
</P>
<P>
 Many Latin American officials have been concerned about the encroachment of 
U.S. airlines in their region at the expense of local carriers. But U.S. 
officials insisted that their actions Friday were based solely on safety 
concerns and not economic considerations. 
</P>
<P>
 FAA officials, in arriving at their assessments, are using "minimal 
international standards that have been adopted by the International Civil 
Aviation Organization" which all nations of the world have endorsed, according 
to Dale McDaniel, the FAA's deputy assistant administrator for policy. 
</P>
<P>
 "The FAA is not the world's aviation policeman and has no jurisdiction over 
the oversight capabilities of countries whose air carriers operate from outside 
the United States," Pena said.  
</P>
<P>
 "However, we do have a right and an obligation to look after aviation safety 
within our own borders."

IN RUSSIA SPACE PROGRAM HEROICS, COSMONAUT SNARES CRUCIAL SUPPLIES; SUCCESS: 
LOSS OF WAYWARD VESSEL COULD HAVE FORCED CREW TO ABANDON MIR STATION. PROGRAM 
GETS BOOST. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 With Russia's beleaguered space program on the line, a rookie cosmonaut aboard 
the Mir orbiting station guided an unmanned, supply-laden freighter to a safe 
docking by remote control Friday after it twice failed to land on autopilot. 
</P>
<P>
 The tricky linkup by Lt. Col. Yuri Malenchenko, a first in Moscow's annals of 
space achievement, saved $60 million worth of research equipment, food and 
supplies for scheduled manned missions with the European Space Agency next 
month and the United States in March. 
</P>
<P>
 Russian space officials said that failure to dock the freighter on the third 
try would have forced Malenchenko and his two fellow cosmonauts, running low on 
food, to abandon the Mir station. That, they said, would have delayed or even 
canceled the joint missions, worth millions of dollars in revenues. 
</P>
<P>
 Several dockings between the Mir and American space shuttles are planned in 
the next two years to gain flight experience for assembling a new station later 
this decade. 
</P>
<P>
 Rockwell International Corp., the Seal Beach-based builder of the shuttles, 
and McDonnell Douglas Corp.'s space group in Huntington Beach are developing 
major parts of the new station. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were very pleased when we heard of the successful docking," said Bill 
Collopy, a Rockwell vice president. The earlier failed attempts "were of great 
concern" because they "threatened the operation of the Mir," he added. 
</P>
<P>
 Facing his first emergency after two months in space, Malenchenko was under 
severe pressure. The Itar-Tass news agency declared that the survival of 
Russia's space program "now rests literally in the hands of one man." 
</P>
<P>
 Technicians at the flight control center in Kaliningrad guided the 32-year-old 
cosmonaut through his task by radio as he soared over the Atlantic Ocean late 
Friday afternoon and burst into cheers when he succeeded. 
</P>
<P>
 Malenchenko, a former air force fighter pilot, controlled both the Mir station 
and the freighter, Progress. From a command module of the Mir, he watched 
television images beamed from the robot freighter that simulated the view from 
its driver's seat. 
</P>
<P>
 When the two vessels were about 150 yards apart, space officials said, he 
activated the remote controls and steered the Progress at about one foot per 
second toward a conical target two feet in diameter. 
</P>
<P>
 "Docking took place on the first attempt," said Vsevolod P. Latyshev, a 
spokesman at the control center. "We are so relieved. You could feel the 
tension." 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the events that led to the emergency were troubling for the space 
program, which has fallen on hard times since the Soviet Union collapsed three 
years ago, and for the foreign clients lined up to help revive it. 
</P>
<P>
 Cosmonauts shuttle to the space station aboard rocket ships and are resupplied 
regularly by rocket-borne freighters. But the government-run space agency ran 
short of cash to pay the newly privatized company that makes the rockets and 
had to scrap plans for a supply launch in July. 
</P>
<P>
 With the Mir station's food due to run out in mid-September and no backup 
rocket ready, everything depended on the Progress and its 2.6-ton cargo, 
launched Aug. 25. 
</P>
<P>
 Because budget cuts have closed some ground tracking stations, specialists 
believed that Russia risked losing Mir, the centerpiece of the space program, 
if it were left unmanned. 
</P>
<P>
 Guided by autopilot, the Progress made two docking attempts, last Saturday and 
on Tuesday, bumping into the 130-ton space station several times before gliding 
past. As the freighter ran low on fuel, the space agency decided to try manual 
docking, which it had never tried with a loaded freighter. 
</P>
<P>
 "It is remarkable how Russians heroically create problems for themselves only 
to resolve them heroically too," television anchorman Sergei Dorenko said in a 
special report on the drama. 
</P>
<P>
 Space officials have not publicly discussed the docking failures but complain 
of inadequate government financing for their once-mighty industry. 
</P>
<P>
 They are pinning their hopes on $400 million in revenues pledged by NASA over 
the next four years for U.S.-Russian spaceflights and money from the Europeans 
for an Oct. 4 blastoff by a German and two Russians. 
</P>
<P>
 "Today, we work only four days a week instead of six or seven as we used to," 
Latyshev said.

 James Oberg, an independent consultant on the Russian space program in 
Houston, said the crisis showed scientists, engineers and cosmonauts at their 
best in the face of exhausted resources. "The cosmonauts definitely deserve a 
feast tonight with all that food they got," he said. "But they can't keep going 
to the edge like this."

SERB REBELS THREATEN TO BLOCK AID TO MUSLIMS UNTIL EMBARGO IS ENDED 
</P>

 Cut off by his former patrons in Serbia, the desperate leader of Bosnian Serb 
rebels has threatened to retaliate by blocking vital aid to Muslim enclaves. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even a bird will not be able to fly across (areas held by the Muslim-led 
government) until the world forces Yugoslavia to lift its economic sanctions 
against us," warlord Radovan Karadzic told an assembly of Bosnian Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
 Serbia, hoping to end crippling international sanctions punishing it for 
inciting the war in Bosnia, froze all but humanitarian aid to Bosnian Serbs a 
month ago, severing the lifeline that had sustained the rebels' 29-month-old 
war. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one in the world expected Yugoslavia to introduce . . . sanctions against 
us," Karadzic told the assembly in Pale on Thursday. He said this gave Bosnian 
Serbs the same right to impose sanctions against others. 
</P>
<P>
 U.N. aid officials predict a humanitarian disaster if Karadzic carries out his 
threat to cut off food, water, gas and electricity to the republic's Muslims 
and Croats. 
</P>
<P>
 It was the Bosnian Serbs' rejection of an international peace plan that 
touched off Serbia's embargo. Serbia hopes to end the U.N. sanctions against 
Yugoslavia by backing the Bosnian Serbs into a corner and forcing them to 
accept the plan. 
</P>
<P>
 Bosnian Serbs have rebuffed the plan because it would require them to 
relinquish about a third of the 70% of Bosnia they seized during the war, with 
the remainder going to a Muslim-Croat federation, which has accepted the 
proposal.

CLINTON OFFERS SUPPORT TO IRELAND; EUROPE: BUT NO NEW FUNDS ARE PROMISED. 
PRESIDENT INTERRUPTS VACATION TO MEET WITH NATION'S FOREIGN MINISTER. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 President Clinton met briefly Friday with Irish Foreign Minister Richard 
Spring and offered support, but no new money, to help Ireland's peace effort. 
</P>
<P>
 "The United States is strongly supportive of this peace process," Clinton said 
in a statement to Irish television after the meeting at his vacation residence 
near here. "We want all the communities to feel a part of the peace process and 
to feel that there is a peace dividend." 
</P>
<P>
 For his part, Spring told reporters afterward that Clinton had made a "genuine 
and serious commitment to assisting," adding that he "would be hopeful that 
substantial sums would be forthcoming." 
</P>
<P>
 As a way of easing tensions, British and Irish officials hope to begin 
economic development projects in Northern Ireland -- the area that remains part 
of Britain. 
</P>
<P>
 But White House officials made it clear that Spring's hope is unlikely to be 
fulfilled any time soon. Clinton and Spring "didn't even talk about dollar 
figures," White House Press Secretary Dee Dee Myers told reporters after the 
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton said he wants to "look for ways to help" the peace process by aiding 
economic development in Northern Ireland, Myers said, but his Administration 
faces "severe budgetary constraints" on any foreign aid package. 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the foreign aid budget for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 has been 
approved by Congress, so any funds for Northern Ireland beyond the $20 million 
that the United States already provides would have to wait more than a year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even then, given the tight nature of the U.S. foreign aid budget, financial 
assistance for economic development in Northern Ireland probably would be a 
tough sell. 
</P>
<P>
 Administration officials hope the United States can help but have suggested 
the main source of aid is likely to be private investment. They expect such 
assistance to increase if the cease-fire declared earlier this week by the 
Irish Republican Army holds. 
</P>
<P>
 One possibility would be for the U.S. government to provide insurance to 
American investors who want to join in Irish development projects but worry 
about the risks posed by the region's 25 years of guerrilla warfare that has 
claimed more than 3,000 lives. 
</P>
<P>
 In Northern Ireland on Friday, the IRA apparently was holding its fire, 
refusing to break its cease-fire as a carpenter killed by Protestant gunmen was 
buried and the Protestants claimed responsibility for another slaying, the 
Associated Press reported. 
</P>
<P>
 The Protestant killings were the first test of the IRA's resolve to make 
peace. Skeptics have said the cease-fire would only last until the first 
Catholic was killed. 
</P>
<P>
 Gerry Adams, head of the Sinn Fein party allied with the IRA, appealed to his 
supporters to remain calm in the face of Protestant provocation. 
</P>
<P>
 "The IRA is a disciplined force and will not be provoked by anyone who is 
trying to wreck the peace process," Adams said in Dublin. 
</P>
<P>
 Moderate Protestants urged the gunmen to stop the killings that they said 
would only help the IRA, the AP said. Adams called on the British government to 
begin discussing withdrawing its troops from Northern Ireland in response to 
the cease-fire, which began Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 At the funeral for Sean MacDermott, a 37-year-old Catholic carpenter slain 
early Wednesday, Monsignor Michael Dallat led more than 1,000 mourners in 
prayers for peace. 
</P>
<P>
 MacDermott was dragged from his home and shot by masked Ulster Volunteer Force 
gunmen before the IRA offered a cease-fire as a gesture toward ending its 
campaign of shootings and bombings. 
</P>
<P>
 Meantime, the hard-line Protestant Ulster Defense Assn. acknowledged killing 
John O'Hanlon, 32, on Thursday, the first day of the cease-fire. It also 
admitted shooting at a taxicab, but the Catholic driver was not hit. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Clinton, his meeting with Spring was the only major break so far in his 
vacation regimen of golf, boating and reading, and he did not allow the 
interruption to linger. 
</P>
<P>
 Within moments of the Irish visitor's departure, Clinton's motorcade was 
headed up the dirt road from his house on Martha's Vineyard to a nearby state 
forest, where he went on a 25-minute jog. 
</P>
<P>
 Clinton later headed off for a sailing excursion to a small island in Vineyard 
Sound with his vacation companion, Washington lawyer and lobbyist Vernon 
Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
 Unlike last summer, when Clinton and his wife, Hillary, maintained a hectic 
schedule of dinners with the island's rich and famous, the President and First 
Lady have kept a relatively low profile. 
</P>
<P>
 The Clintons dined one night at the home of Katharine Graham, the retired 
publisher of the Washington Post, and another night with authors William Styron 
and Gabriel Garcia Marquez. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than that, the President has ventured forth mostly to play golf, while 
the First Lady and daughter Chelsea have spent much of their time relaxing at 
their vacation home, a secluded house near the beach. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday night, the Clintons attended a party for reporters, where the 
President played saxophone with a local band and sang with Carly Simon as the 
sun set.

TRIBAL ELDERS VOTE TO BANISH 2 TEEN-AGE ROBBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DOUG CONNER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A panel of elders from the Tlingit tribe voted Friday night to banish two 
young felons to the Alaska wilds, agreeing to a plan set in motion by a 
Washington state judge. 
</P>
<P>
 Simon P. Roberts and Adrian J. Guthrie, both 17-year-old Tlingits from Alaska, 
pleaded guilty to beating a deliveryman and robbing him of $50 in Everett, 
Wash., last year. The 12-member tribal court of Tlingit elders met in tiny 
Klawock to question the youths and rule on punishment and compensation for the 
crimes. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the questioning Friday involved a white man the boys say gave them the 
idea for the assault and robbery. One elder branded the unidentified man an 
accomplice who should be on trial as well. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier, Guthrie recounted their story of how they drank rum at a party and 
hatched a plan to order a pizza, then ambush the driver, "to make quick cash." 
Roberts admitted hitting the driver, Tim Whittlesey, two or three times in the 
head with a baseball bat. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, Roberts was rebuked for smirking during the proceedings. "You 
don't joke about things like this," said elder George Dalton Sr. "This joking 
manner has brought you to this position." 
</P>
<P>
 "Alcohol has brought us to this position," Roberts responded. 
</P>
<P>
 The hearing was held in a modest community hall more often the site of bingo 
games than high ritual, and it has drawn an international focus to this fishing 
and logging village of 800 on Prince of Wales Island near the southern tip of 
the Alaskan panhandle. 
</P>
<P>
 In July, a Snohomish County, Wash., judge consented to an unusual alternative 
sentence proposed by the boys' defense: solitary banishment to uninhabited 
islands for a year. The exiles would live off the land and reflect on the 
nature of their crimes, following Tlingit custom. Restitution would be made to 
the victim, in the form of money or a new house. 
</P>
<P>
 But almost immediately questions arose about the arrangement. Most Tlingits 
say they've never heard of banishment as a tribal tradition. State and federal 
agencies cautioned that they would not allow the use of their lands for such 
purposes. 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the controversy centers on Rudy James, a Tlingit living in the Seattle 
area who convinced Superior Court Judge James Allendoerfer to allow him to take 
Roberts and Guthrie back to Alaska, where he said the tribe would monitor the 
banishment. Tribal officials in Klawock say James never talked to them about 
supervising the punishment or contributing to restitution. 
</P>
<P>
 Allendoerfer postponed his official sentencing until March, 1996, when the two 
are ordered to return to court. They still could receive 2 1/2 to 5 1/2 years 
in a Washington state prison. Snohomish County prosecutors say they doubt the 
two will spend any time banished to an island, and have appealed Allendoerfer's 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Whittlesey, 25, partially deaf from the attack, said he supports the plan and 
attended the council meeting with family members.

 Federal officials say border crossings are being expanded in half a dozen 
states to allow frequent commuters easier travel between the United States and 
Canada. 
</P>
<P>
 Border crossings in Maine, Michigan, Montana, North Dakota, Vermont and 
Washington state have been targeted for the expansion, said officials for the 
U.S. Customs Service and the Immigration and Naturalization Service. 
</P>
<P>
 Special commuter lanes already are being used at Blaine, Wash., for frequent

POLAND'S STRICT ABORTION LAW SURVIVES CHALLENGE; EUROPE: LEGISLATORS FAIL TO 
OVERRIDE PRESIDENT WALESA'S VETO OF BILL EASING LIMITS ON WOMEN'S ACCESS TO THE 
PROCEDURE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 One of Europe's strictest abortion laws survived a strenuous challenge Friday 
when Polish lawmakers failed to override a presidential veto of legislation 
that would have made abortions more readily available. 
</P>
<P>
 The vote was a victory for President Lech Walesa, and it staved off a 
high-stakes power struggle between the staunchly antiabortion president and the 
governing coalition, which is led by former Communists who favor easing 
abortion restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
 Walesa, a devout Roman Catholic and father of eight, had said he would not 
sign the legislation even if the Sejm, the lower house of Parliament, voted to 
override his veto. Under such a scenario, the president could have been called 
before a constitutional tribunal and forced to step down. 
</P>
<P>
 But the standoff was averted when the Sejm fell 42 votes short of the required 
two-thirds majority needed to override the veto, with 232 deputies voting 
against Walesa, 157 for him and 22 abstaining. 
</P>
<P>
 "The president welcomes the Parliament's acceptance of his argument that human 
life should be protected," said Walesa spokesman Leszek Spalinski. 
</P>
<P>
 Abortion rights advocates said they would not give up and pledged to push for 
a nationwide referendum. But because of that long process, the highly explosive 
subject effectively has been defused until next year, virtually assuring it a 
prominent role in the presidential election. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to have a public vote on this," said Tomasz Nalecz, spokesman for the 
Union of Labor, whose parliamentary members voted against Walesa. "Because the 
presidential veto must be overturned by a two-thirds majority, we are in a 
situation where decisions are being made by the minority." 
</P>
<P>
 The abortion debate has fast become one of the most divisive issues in 
democratic Poland. More than 90% of the citizens identify themselves as Roman 
Catholic, but polls show that a majority of citizens support liberalizing 
abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 The church's strong antiabortion stance has created a backlash against its 
political and social moralizing and was viewed as an important factor in the 
election defeat last year of several right-wing parties that had pushed for the 
law now in place. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, passed early last year with strong church backing, permits abortions 
only when a woman's health is threatened, when a prosecutor determines the 
pregnancy resulted from a crime or when the fetus is badly deformed. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Ireland and Malta impose greater restrictions among European countries, 
and Poland is the only former Eastern Bloc country to have reversed the easy 
availability of abortion under communism. 
</P>
<P>
 At its peak, there were about 100,000 registered abortions a year in Poland 
and hundreds of thousands of unregistered ones. In the first year of the new 
law, there were fewer than 800 legal abortions, although there are no estimates 
on the number of women who turned to the gynecological underground or went 
abroad to terminate pregnancies. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are not exactly sure how large the black market is, but there is no doubt 
the number of abortions has dropped," said Pawel Wisicki of the Polish 
Federation of Movements for the Protection of Human Life. "The present law has 
done a lot of good, and it would make no sense to change something that bore 
such good fruit." 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation vetoed by Walesa was written by a group of women legislators 
from several left-wing parties who had fought unsuccessfully to block the 
restrictions last year. Their amendments would have eased criteria for abortion 
to include women experiencing financial difficulties or family hardship. 
</P>
<P>
 "This still wouldn't have given women freedom of choice, because someone else 
would have decided whether her situation was bad enough or not to warrant an 
abortion," said Wanda Nowicka, who heads the Federation for Women and Family 
Planning, a Warsaw group that supports abortion rights. 
</P>
<P>
 While the church attacked the proposed changes as too vague and far-reaching, 
critics of the existing law contended that it discriminates against the poor 
because wealthier women can go abroad or pay for an illegal abortion in Poland. 
So-called abortion tours are advertised in Polish newspapers by foreign 
companies, and even Polish clinics advertise services using easily deciphered 
euphemisms. "It is demoralizing to have laws that are meant to be broken," said 
Nalecz of the Union of Labor. 
</P>
<P>
 The law does not punish a woman who has an illegal abortion but calls for a 
two-year prison sentence for the doctor who performs it. Enforcement has been 
difficult, however, leading critics to charge that the law has done little more 
than drive up the cost of abortions and force doctors and patients to go 
underground. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the 53 cases of alleged illegal abortions investigated in the law's first 
year, none resulted in a conviction. A report by the Justice Ministry concluded 
that the small number of cases could indicate that the new law has caused a 
huge drop in the number of abortions or, more likely, that illegal abortions 
are simply not being reported to authorities.

CHINA DISSIDENT'S WIFE LISTS ABUSES; HUMAN RIGHTS: BUT HER WILLINGNESS TO SPEAK 
OUT DEMONSTRATES THAT THE NATION IS GRADUALLY BECOMING LESS REPRESSIVE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HOLLEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Qin Yongmin, one of China's beaten and bruised political prisoners, is a 
stubborn man. 
</P>
<P>
 His story, related by his wife, Li Jinfang, offers insights into repression 
and change in China, the hopes of its most hardy dissidents, and the dilemmas 
facing the Clinton Administration as it shifts rapidly from confrontation with 
China over human rights to a policy of commercial engagement. 
</P>
<P>
 The imprisonment and apparent torture of Qin, 41, reflect the continuing 
brutality of the Chinese system, as stressed by human rights advocates who are 
fiercely critical of the change in U.S. policy represented by Commerce 
Secretary Ronald H. Brown's just-completed six-day sales mission to China. 
</P>
<P>
 Brown's trip focused on signings of $6 billion worth of agreements between 
U.S. companies and their Chinese counterparts. He avoided public criticism on 
human rights issues. 
</P>
<P>
 But Qin's experiences, and his wife's willingness to risk speaking openly 
about them, also illustrate a point made by many advocates of closer U.S.-China 
commercial ties: Fitfully, with some setbacks, China is gradually becoming a 
less repressive society. 
</P>
<P>
 Qin is now serving a two-year "labor reform" prison sentence for actions he 
took last fall -- conducting a one-man campaign in opposition to China's bid to 
host the 2000 Olympics and signing a "Peace Charter" with eight other 
dissidents calling on the government to allow a national dialogue on political 
change. 
</P>
<P>
 Qin is imprisoned in the central China city of Wuhan. Li, 29, was allowed 
brief, monitored monthly visits until May. Since then, other relatives have 
seen him, but Li has been banned. 
</P>
<P>
 Twice during his imprisonment Qin has been badly beaten, Li said. The first 
incident occurred June 8, before a meal in the dining hall, when another 
prisoner attacked him, kicking him in the testicles and beating him until he 
lost consciousness, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities in Chinese prisons often exercise control through selected 
prisoners who serve as enforcers against others. It was one of these prisoners, 
Li said, who beat her husband. After Qin recovered consciousness, he was 
inspected at the prison clinic but given no treatment, Li said. 
</P>
<P>
 On July 20, a prison warden came to Qin's cell and told him he must work, Li 
said. Qin replied that he wanted to see a doctor first. The warden left, saying 
authorities would discuss his request, "then a criminal rushed in and beat him 
severely," Li said. "He rushed out to the courtyard. Wardens dragged him back 
into the cell, and he was beaten until he became unconscious." 
</P>
<P>
 Four or five days later, Qin was finally taken to a hospital. "The hospital 
told him that treatment had been delayed for too long," she said. "His 
testicles were shrunk and broken, and there was no way for them to heal. There 
was no way to treat him." 
</P>
<P>
 When Qin first arrived at the prison, he had been ordered by authorities not 
to let other prisoners know that he was incarcerated for political reasons, Li 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 "They insisted that he not tell other prisoners the reason for his 
imprisonment but that he say he was there for fighting," she said. "He refused. 
He said, 'I cannot deny my identity.' He always insisted on his rights. That's 
why they treat him so badly." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked why Qin remained uncowed, Li said it was because of his eight years as a 
political prisoner from 1981 to 1989. 
</P>
<P>
 Qin is among the less famous of the "Democracy Wall" activists of 1977-1979 
who published unauthorized magazines calling for democracy and hung posters on 
a wall in downtown Beijing during the first temporary wave of liberalization 
after the 1976 death of Chairman Mao Tse-tung. 
</P>
<P>
 After the democracy movement had helped Deng Xiaoping consolidate supreme 
power, he turned against the activists and ordered their arrests. Qin was 
arrested in November, 1979, for selling magazines, then later released but was 
arrested again in April, 1981, in the government's final crackdown on the 
Democracy Wall activists. 
</P>
<P>
 Qin was released in April, 1989, just as that year's Tian An Men Square 
pro-democracy demonstrations were rising toward a confrontation that ended in a 
bloody army crackdown. 
</P>
<P>
 Li met Qin four months later, and they soon fell in love and married. They now 
have a 3-year-old daughter. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said: 'I'm someone who works for democracy, and I can't put all my efforts 
into a family. Someone who is with me has to be prepared to suffer, financially 
and spiritually,' " Li recalled. 
</P>
<P>
 Li said that, while police have threatened that at any time they could take 
her away too, she is unafraid. "Everything I'm doing is within the limits of 
legality," she said. "China isn't just an iron fist anymore. The country is 
moving toward the use of law. They don't just use violence." 
</P>
<P>
 Qin, she said, feels much the same way: 
</P>
<P>
 "My husband said, 'If all this were happening during the Cultural Revolution 
(of 1966-1976), I wouldn't be alive anymore.' "

CHINA LIMITS ATHLETE HURT IN CRACKDOWN

 China is barring an athlete from international games for the disabled because 
his legs were crushed by a tank during the bloody crackdown on the Tian An Men 
Square democracy movement, a friend said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Xu Liangying, a longtime democracy activist, said the authorities were afraid 
foreign reporters would start asking embarrassing human rights questions if 
they found out how the athlete, Fang Zheng, was disabled. 
</P>
<P>
 Fang's permission to compete in next week's competition in Beijing was 
canceled in July.  
</P>
<P>
 Fang was a senior at the Beijing Physical Education College when the capital 
was rocked by the huge student demonstrations for democracy in 1989. During the 
crackdown, Fang's legs were crushed under a tank. One of his legs was amputated 
at the knee, the other above the knee, Xu said.

U.N. PANEL VOWS JUSTICE IN RWANDA; AFRICA: COMMISSION HAS ONLY THREE MEMBERS 
BUT WILL PROBE GENOCIDE OF HALF A MILLION PEOPLE. REPORT IS PLEDGED BY MONTH'S 
END. 
</P>

<P>
 At present, they are just a handful -- three jurists and four investigators. 
Yet members of a U.N. commission sent here to probe the swiftest genocide of 
modern times vowed Friday to identify those responsible so they can face trial. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not solely for the sake of justice," said Atsu-Koffi Amega, a former 
foreign minister of Togo who was named president of the U.N. commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "Time is pressing," Amega said. "We must not allow time for vengeance, for 
private justice, for reprisals." 
</P>
<P>
 To do that would give another powerful twist to the tragic spiral of ethnic 
murder and hatred that has afflicted this small mountainous land in Central 
Africa for 3 1/2 decades. It would also abort the fragile steps now under way 
toward reconciliation. 
</P>
<P>
 An ethnic blood bath drenched Rwanda last spring. As many as half a million 
people, and perhaps many more, were slaughtered. The massacres are regarded by 
many as the most abject failure to date of the international community to 
enforce worldwide standards of civil conduct and human safety. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.N. Security Council, by establishing a three-member panel in July to 
investigate charges that Rwanda's former Hutu government orchestrated a 
campaign to wipe out the Tutsi minority, took a first if modest step toward 
bringing those responsible for the mass murders to account. "Let justice be 
done," Amega told a news conference. 
</P>
<P>
 He and the other two African jurists who sit on the commission arrived in 
Rwanda's capital Monday. By the end of the month, Amega pledged, his panel will 
have sent an interim report to U.N. Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali. A 
full report to the Security Council is due by November's end. 
</P>
<P>
 In April, guided by government troops, gangs of young thugs with clubs, 
machetes and spears rampaged through this city sprawled across the back of 
pleasant green hills, hunting members of the ethnic group that until the 1950s 
had ruled the Hutus as feudal overlords for centuries. 
</P>
<P>
 The explosion of violence was triggered by the deaths of President Juvenal 
Habyarimana and the leader of neighboring Burundi, Cyprian Ntayamira -- both 
Hutus -- in a plane crash. The feared Interahamwe militia, the armed youth wing 
of the late president's party, is blamed for much of the killing. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are going to determine responsibility, one by one," pledged Haby Dieng, a 
lawyer from Guinea. 
</P>
<P>
 Just as important, commission members said, they will recommend what sort of 
tribunal should put the killers on trial -- a Rwandan court or a panel like the 
one that judged Nazi war criminals at Nuremberg. 
</P>
<P>
 If a super-national court were established, it would be a milestone in the 
protection of human rights since the U.N. Convention outlawing genocide was 
passed by the General Assembly in 1948. An international court has never 
assembled to put on trial those accused of violating the Convention, experts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 A lack of precedent and the grindingly slow progress in a similarly mandated 
U.N. effort to identify war criminals in the Balkans make many doubt that the 
international community can take speedier or more effective action in Rwanda. 
</P>
<P>
 Skeptics include the leaders of the Rwandan Patriotic Front, which ousted the 
Hutu-dominated government in July and now holds power. Rwandan President 
Pasteur Bizimungu and Prime Minister Faustin Twagirimungu have complained that 
to allow foreign governments or the United Nations to control the tribunal 
would likely lead to unacceptably long delays. They have insisted that genocide 
trials be convened as soon as possible against Hutu officials who planned, 
ordered or carried out the massacres. 
</P>
<P>
 At the same time, members of Rwanda's government were said last month to have 
offered assurances that an international tribunal would receive jurisdiction 
over any genocide investigations rather than leaving it to the Tutsi leaders to 
determine justice. 
</P>
<P>
 A division of labor may be the solution proposed by the U.N. commission of 
African jurists. Its third member, Salifoul Fomba of Mali, said members of the 
former Rwandan government and other ringleaders could be put on trial by an 
international court, while "small fry" would be left to Rwandan judges. 
</P>
<P>
 Amega conceded there is a danger of the legal process being exploited here by 
the now-triumphant Tutsis to avenge their countrymen. 
</P>
<P>
 "To allow a Rwandan court to try the genocide cases would make them (Tutsis) 
both judge and victim," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bled by massacres and civil war, Rwanda may simply not be able to organize 
proper trials. 
</P>
<P>
 Marthe Mukamurenzi of Rwanda's Justice Ministry said Friday, for example, that 
she knew of only three Rwandan lawyers still alive. 
</P>
<P>
 Further, just bringing killers into court would also be problematic. Leaders 
of the ousted government and their followers have fled Rwanda en masse for 
Zaire, Tanzania and other nearby countries. 
</P>
<P>
 And despite their pledges and encouraging talk, members of the U.N. commission 
were forced to acknowledge that they have only four investigators in this 
country, which is roughly as large as Maryland. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't laugh. It's very serious," Amega upbraided journalists who reacted to 
his revelation about his scant staff. 
</P>
<P>
 He said he has asked other countries to provide 200 forensic medical experts 
and legal investigators to help in the probe of genocide and human rights 
violations. He said Friday that he expects many of them to be at work in two 
weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 When the three jurists' work is finished here, the Security Council will be 
free to accept or reject its recommendations. Even if it accepts them, setting 
up a tribunal and prosecutions could consume much time.

CANADA CITY POLICE FORCE DISPLACED IN DRUG PROBE; LAW: 35 PEOPLE IN MONTREAL 
SUBURB ARE CHARGED WITH TRAFFICKING AND OTHER ABUSES AFTER A SECRET 
INVESTIGATION. 
</P>

<P>
 In a scene out of "The Untouchables," Quebec provincial police have swept into 
this Montreal suburb and displaced the entire 24-member police force in a 
drug-dealing and corruption investigation. 
</P>
<P>
 Charges were brought Friday against 35 people, including two police officers, 
one from Chambly and another from neighboring Brossard. Among the charges filed 
were trafficking in anabolic steroids, conspiracy, possession of stolen 
property and weapons violations, said prosecutor Madeleine Giauque. She added 
that more charges are expected next week. 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, members of the provincial police, known here as Surete du Quebec, 
occupied the small brick police headquarters, patrolled streets and carried out 
other local enforcement duties. They also questioned city officials, including 
Mayor Pierre Bourbonnais, himself a Montreal police officer. 
</P>
<P>
 This pleasant bedroom community of 17,000, set on a reservoir half an hour's 
drive east of Montreal, has every appearance of a typical middle-class suburb. 
</P>
<P>
 Except for the snow shovels in the garages and the street signs in French, 
many of the neighborhoods would not look out of place in Anaheim or the San 
Gabriel Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 But for years Chambly has been the subject of rumors of local corruption 
linked to drug-dealing gangs. The Surete du Quebec and the Royal Canadian 
Mounted Police launched investigations in 1988, 1992 and 1993, but each was 
compromised by leaks. 
</P>
<P>
 This time, the probe was kept secret for five months and the first thing 
provincial officers did when they began their raids and seizures at 6 a.m. 
Thursday was to nab all the Chambly police and move them to a nearby military 
base for questioning. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 140 people were reportedly interrogated Thursday, and 350 provincial 
police participated in the raids, which took place throughout Quebec but were 
centered here. 
</P>
<P>
 Constable Lucie Boult, a Surete du Quebec spokeswoman, said Friday that four 
prosecutors had been assigned to review evidence. 
</P>
<P>
 She added that Chambly police officers would be subject to internal discipline 
as well as criminal charges in the probe. She said potential violations 
included alcohol and cigarette smuggling, fraud and bribery, in addition to the 
charges brought Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Boult emphasized that not every Chambly officer is under suspicion and said 
some could be back on the job as early as next week, after discussions between 
provincial investigators and city officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Provincial police will continue to perform local functions as long as 
necessary, she said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bourbonnais was huddled with aides and investigators Friday and was 
unavailable for comment. But he told Canadian reporters Thursday that he was 
shocked by the corruption reports. That brought snorts of derision from some 
residents familiar with previous investigations. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is an old town where everyone locks elbows and protects each other. 
You'd see police driving around in Corvettes and wonder where they got the 
money. Everyone would whisper, but no one talked," one woman, who described 
herself as a retired history teacher, told reporters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chambly police force has been without a chief since June, when Fernand 
Gagnon's contract was not renewed after five years. Gagnon, a former Surete du 
Quebec officer, is suing for reinstatement and asserted that he instigated the 
investigation that led to the raids. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chambly raid followed by a few days a series of arrests throughout Quebec 
in a broad cocaine-smuggling and money-laundering investigation by the Mounted 
Police and the Surete du Quebec. 
</P>
<P>
 Although unrelated, the two actions represent an increased emphasis by 
authorities on halting the illegal trade in drugs, tax-free alcohol and 
tax-free cigarettes in the province. 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the smuggling occurs on the border between Quebec and the United 
States. The United States serves as the source of the alcohol and cigarettes 
and the destination for many of the illegal drugs, police say.

 Presidents Hafez Assad of Syria and Elias Hrawi of Lebanon met to discuss the 
Middle East peace process in preparation for Secretary of State Warren 
Christopher's visit to the region this month.Christopher is trying to revive 
peace talks between Syria and Israel, which have stalemated since February. 
Lebanon, which is dominated by Syria, has stressed it will resume talks only 
when Syria does. Syria wants a complete Israeli withdrawal from the Golan 
Heights, which Israel captured in 1967 and annexed in 1981. Sources close to 
Lebanese Prime Minister Rafik Hariri said Christopher will probably visit 
Beirut this trip.

 The leader of an Islamic sect outlawed by Malaysia's government as a security 
threat was sent back to Malaysia by Thai authorities, police said.Officials in 
Thailand said Ashaari Mohamad was detained as an illegal immigrant after the 
Malaysian government notified them that his passport had been revoked. He was 
living in self-imposed exile in Thailand. In banning his Al Arqam sect last 
week, Malaysia accused Ashaari of deviating from Islam and said his group had 
become a national threat by sowing disunity among Muslim Malays, the country's 
majority ethnic group.

CONFERENCE SAFETY A PRIORITY IN CAIRO; TOURISM: EGYPT HOPES PEACEFUL POPULATION 
MEETING WILL REDEEM REPUTATION OF CAPITAL CITY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By KIM MURPHY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 For weeks, the bloom on this dusty old city had been almost palpable. New, 
young trees were planted in boulevard medians, curbs were repainted, 
pothole-peppered streets were repaved. The whole country almost seemed to be 
pulling itself out of the doldrums. 
</P>
<P>
 After three years of Islamic militant violence had choked the life out of the 
$3-billion-a-year tourist industry, a six-month lull in tourist attacks seemed 
to put all that in the past. Hotel bookings started climbing, and summer 
tourism rose 14% over last year. 
</P>
<P>
 It was with this air of confidence that Egypt prepared for what officials are 
calling the largest tourist event in its history: the U.N.-sponsored 
International Conference on Population and Development, scheduled to bring 
20,000 delegates -- including world leaders such as Vice President Al Gore and 
former President Jimmy Carter -- into the Egyptian capital starting Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 Then, last week, Islamic gunmen opened fire on a tour bus in southern Egypt, 
killing a Spanish teen-ager and wounding three others. The militant Gamaa al 
Islamiya followed up its claim of responsibility with a warning to foreigners: 
"The Gamaa advises all foreigners taking part in the licentious conference 
known as the Population Conference that, by taking part in this conference, 
which all sectors of the Egyptian people have rejected . . . , they are putting 
themselves in danger's way." 
</P>
<P>
 One week later, the gunmen suspected in the bus attack were themselves killed 
by Egyptian police, and Tourism Minister Mamdouh Beltagi was confidently 
brushing aside the Islamic warnings. "It is very easy to send a fax warning. 
That is not automatically to be considered as credible," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But by night, Beltagi is going home and putting an ice pack on his head. 
</P>
<P>
 For Egypt -- where tourism revenues can make or break an economy that depends 
on them as its largest source of foreign currency -- much depends on the 
peaceful outcome of the conference. 
</P>
<P>
 And security is only part of Beltagi's headache. He must also coordinate 
transportation for delegates from hotels all over Cairo, through the city's 
legendary traffic snarls and out to the modern new conference center on the 
city's eastern edge. He must arrange for computer link-ups, satellite feeds and 
journalists demanding mobile phones. 
</P>
<P>
 Logistics alone prompted worries in a city that almost routinely turns its 
annual international film festival into a fiasco by mixing up the show times 
and leaving VIPs stuck waiting for seats at the opening night gala. 
</P>
<P>
 And the worries weren't eased by Wednesday and Thursday, when delegates from 
non-governmental organizations and journalists had to wait up to four hours for 
their conference badges. A near-riot broke out Wednesday when CNN showed up and 
moved to the front of the line. 
</P>
<P>
 Yet, for everything that could go wrong, Egypt has been moving ahead with 
remarkable aplomb. 
</P>
<P>
 Leave has been canceled for all security services, and 14,000 police and 
soldiers have been assigned to guard the conference -- patrolling streets, 
monitoring hotels, safe-guarding tourist sites, such as the Pyramids, and 
Islamic monuments. 
</P>
<P>
 Metal detectors are in place at all hotels, and, as has been the custom for 
months, guards check all bags brought into foreign-style eateries such as 
Kentucky Fried Chicken and Baskin-Robbins. 
</P>
<P>
 Dozens of Nile cruise boats have been brought up as floating hotels to 
accommodate conference guests who are not staying in luxury hotels that line 
the banks of the river. Buses will travel from all hotels to the conference 
site, wired with thousands of new telephone lines, modems, faxes and on-line 
computer links. 
</P>
<P>
 "This conference is a certification for Egypt from the international community 
of security, stability, carrying capacity, organizational and touristic 
capabilities," Beltagi said, noting that Egypt has hosted 24 international 
conferences this year. 
</P>
<P>
 "People talk about security when security in Egypt has always been strong," 
Beltagi said. "The U.S., with the best security services in the world, you were 
not able to prevent the assassination of a President . . . and you have not 
been able to control criminality. But has tourism to Miami been affected? In 
Washington or New York, where more than one person is killed a night, have 
tourists stopped going? 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes, the international conference is important for tourism. But tourism to 
Egypt is in the long range -- it is already booming, and the indications are 
that it will continue to boom again. We are very hopeful there will be no 
accidents."

BRITAIN RAISES MONEY NEEDED TO KEEP SCULPTURE FROM GETTY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 After a five-year struggle, Britain appears finally to have prevented the 
Three Graces sculpture from being exported to the Getty Museum in Malibu, 
thanks to a donation by a wealthy Dutch art collector. 
</P>
<P>
 The Financial Times newspaper said today that Baron Hans Heinrich 
Thyssen-Bornemisza had pledged $1.24 million, the final installment needed to 
keep in Britain the 19th-Century marble sculpture by Italy's Antonio Canova."I 
thought it was idiotic to let this thing go to California for a little amount 
of money, so I decided to help," the 73-year-old industrialist told the 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
 The Three Graces has been in the headlines as British museums tried to raise 
the money to match an $11.75-million offer made by the Getty Museum five years 
ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The British government delayed its export in the hope that the money could be 
found. The National Galleries of Scotland and the Victoria and Albert Museum in 
London raised $8.96 million, and Britons were delighted last month when 
multimillionaire John Paul Getty II offered to donate $1.55 million. 
</P>
<P>
 But he almost withdrew his offer after Timothy Clifford, director of the 
Scottish institution, accused Getty of being motivated by ill will toward his 
father, the late J. Paul Getty, whose fortune supports the Getty Museum. Getty 
denied this, Clifford apologized, and Getty said his offer still stood.

ARKANSAS GOVERNOR, MCDOUGAL FACE POSSIBLE RTC FRAUD CLAIMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Federal regulators are investigating possible fraud claims against Arkansas 
Gov. Jim Guy Tucker and James B. McDougal, President Clinton's partner in the 
Whitewater land venture, court records show. 
</P>
<P>
 The Resolution Trust Corp., the government's savings and loan cleanup agency, 
is pursuing civil claims aimed at recovering taxpayers' losses from the failure 
of Madison Guaranty Savings & Loan in Little Rock, Ark., which was owned by 
McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 The investigation is separate from a criminal probe being conducted by the 
special prosecutor in the Whitewater affair, which also is focusing in part on 
Tucker and McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 The documents filed last week in U.S. District Court here state the RTC "is 
conducting an investigation to determine . . . whether to pursue possible 
claims involving McDougal and Tucker and others, including claims for fraud and 
intentional misconduct." 
</P>
<P>
 At issue, according to the records, is "the improper use of Madison funds for 
the benefit of various individuals, including Tucker." 
</P>
<P>
 The court records, first reported by the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette, are the 
most detailed yet on the RTC's civil investigation. The agency filed them in an 
effort to obtain records and testimony from Tucker and McDougal. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men are fighting subpoenas ordering them to provide information to the 
RTC. The agency last week asked a federal judge to order them to comply. 
</P>
<P>
 McDougal has invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination as a 
reason for not complying, the records say. Tucker has cited other legal 
arguments in his fight to oppose the subpoenas.

10-YEAR-OLD GIRL'S SCREAMS DRIVE MAN FROM HER HOUSE AFTER HE ASSAULTS HER 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man entered a home in the middle of the night, walked through the kitchen, 
past the parents' bedroom, down a hall, into the bedroom of a sleeping 
10-year-old girl and sexually assaulted her, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The man threatened the girl and then assaulted her, police said.He ran out the 
back door when she screamed, waking her parents. 
</P>
<P>
 "Her screaming saved her from being raped," her father told the Sentinel of 
Santa Cruz. "She was very brave." 
</P>
<P>
 Police continued to search Friday for the man, who walked into the home about 
4 a.m. Thursday through an unlocked back door. 
</P>
<P>
 The girl, who was not seriously injured, was examined at Dominican Hospital, 
Detective Loran Baker said. 
</P>
<P>
 Police believe the attacker entered the home with the intent to assault the 
child, Baker said. Nothing was stolen and no weapon was used. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has been extremely traumatic," the girl's father said. "It's a terrible 
feeling of having someone come into your home and do something like that and 
then slip out." 
</P>
<P>
 The brazen attack reminded residents all too much of the murder of Polly 
Klaas, who was kidnaped from her home in Petaluma last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "All the mothers, they're all really upset. They were crying," neighbor Robert 
Keller said. 
</P>
<P>
 The attacker was described as a white man between 20 and 30 years old. He is 6 
feet tall and weighs about 170 pounds. He had brown hair tied in a ponytail, 
and the area below the ponytail was shaved. 
</P>
<P>
 "The search and canvassing the neighbors about anything they might have seen 
or heard continued" Friday, said Sgt. Joe Haebe of the Santa Cruz Police 
Department. The victim "is doing fine. We've got a lot of information out 
there. We're hoping it pans out."

U.S. COURT BACKS SIKH PUPILS' RIGHT TO WEAR CEREMONIAL KNIVES TO SCHOOL 
</P>

<P>
 Sikh youths should be allowed to wear ceremonial knives, as their faith 
dictates, at school if other students can be protected from possible harm, a 
federal appeals court ruled Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. 9th Circuit Court of Appeals said a California elementary school must 
make all reasonable efforts to accommodate the religious beliefs and practices 
of three youngsters who have not attended school since January. 
</P>
<P>
 Two brothers and a sister, ages 7, 8 and 10, were barred from their elementary 
school in Livingston, near Merced, after students saw one of the knives and 
told a teacher. The Sikh family sued the district, charging that the policy 
placed an unlawful burden on their freedom of religion. 
</P>
<P>
 The knives, or kirpans, which usually have four-inch blades, are worn by 
Khalsa Sikhs in sheaths under their clothes after baptism, one of five symbols 
of devotion to God. Sikhism is a Hindu religious sect founded in northern 
India. 
</P>
<P>
 The court suggested that the kirpan be blunted and sewn or locked into its 
sheath.

CALIFORNIA ELECTIONS / U.S. SENATE; HUFFINGTON SAYS CENTRAL VALLEY IS KEY TO 
ELECTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE LESHER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Zigzagging through California's farm country, Republican Senate candidate Mike 
Huffington drew a line in the cornfields and declared that he would beat Sen. 
Dianne Feinstein in the state's Central Valley -- or he would lose the race. 
</P>
<P>
 The valley is a key battleground for statewide candidates in California 
because its rich earth is also rich with swing voters. But in this race, it has 
become a fight for political survival because Feinstein has gone after some of 
the area's traditionally Republican supporters. 
</P>
<P>
 "The valley is critical," Huffington said Thursday at a town square meeting in 
Patterson, the "apricot capital of the world." "He or she who carries the 
valley wins the race. . . . And I will win the valley." 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein's inroads in the area were evident recently when she gained the 
endorsement of the California Farm Bureau, the state's largest agricultural 
organization, which backed her Republican opponent, John Seymour, in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, Huffington sought to counter the endorsement by meeting in Fresno 
with a group of about 30 Farm Bureau members who backed his claim that he has 
support from the rank-and-file. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a setup deal," Huffington said about the Feinstein endorsement in an 
interview. "It was political." 
</P>
<P>
 But Democratic campaign officials said the endorsement shows that Feinstein 
has been a friend of agriculture in the Senate and, as a result, Huffington's 
campaign is now doing damage control in the valley. 
</P>
<P>
 "The mere fact that he is fighting for his own (Republican) base . . . is 
indicative that his campaign is in trouble," said Feinstein campaign manager 
Kam Kuwata. "We're going to compete with him in every part of the state." 
</P>
<P>
 As a battleground in the Senate race, the agricultural issues important to 
Central Valley voters are likely to get the candidates' attention. At the top 
of the list of gripes is the Endangered Species Act, which farmers portray as a 
federal land grab that has prevented some of them from working valuable 
property. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington heard the complaint from every audience on his trip. 
</P>
<P>
 "The federal government owns 50% of the dirt in this state," one woman said at 
the Fresno Farm Bureau meeting. "My personal feeling is that if the critters 
can't live on that 50% of the land, then God is calling them home." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington and Feinstein both favor modifications to the Endangered Species 
Act that address some of the agricultural concerns. Both candidates support a 
proposal to require economic impact reports before a species is listed as 
endangered. And both said there are cases -- specifically the kangaroo rat -- 
in which some species might be lost because the economic cost to save them is 
too high. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think people were thinking about the American bald eagle when they passed 
this," Huffington said. "How did we ever get to the rat and the fly?" 
</P>
<P>
 Another issue that still generates strong feelings among the farmers is "Big 
Green," a sweeping environmental initiative that was voted down on the 1990 
ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington reminded audiences that Feinstein was a supporter of the 
initiative. But he was confronted at several stops by Democratic hecklers who 
charged that he was an officer of a group that was one of Big Green's biggest 
sponsors. The hecklers passed out a 1990 annual report from the Natural 
Resources Defense Council that listed Huffington on the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington acknowledged his membership in the group and said that he 
contributed to it. But he said he could not recall when he served. 
</P>
<P>
 "Honest to God, I don't remember the dates because I've been on over 40 boards 
in my life," he said. "But I can guarantee you, I never heard the words (Big 
Green) at any of the board meetings, because I only went to a couple of them. 
And the fact is, I'm against Big Green." 
</P>
<P>
 At a GOP rally in Fresno on Thursday night, Huffington appealed for campaign 
workers, saying he and Feinstein are no more than 4 points apart in private 
opinion polls. 
</P>
<P>
 Going on the offensive, he also issued a new challenge to Feinstein for 
debates. Huffington called for 10 debates -- one per week for the rest of the 
campaign -- in town hall forums throughout the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Feinstein has offered three debate proposals to Huffington, but the Republican 
candidate said Thursday they are too "traditional. I mean, people are bored to 
death," he said. "This is exciting." 
</P>
<P>
 Huffington spent much of his time in the valley Thursday touring agricultural 
production plants. 
</P>
<P>
 He donned a white hard hat and listened above the roar of machinery to 
officials at Patterson Frozen Foods describe their processing system. His 
caravan of about a dozen press and staff cars then whizzed past ranches and 
fields to a cheese factory in Hilmar and to an egg processing plant in Turlock. 
</P>
<P>
 Ernie Gemperle, who became an egg producer when he arrived in California from 
Switzerland 45 years ago, escorted Huffington through a stadium-sized chicken 
coop where a conveyor belt automatically transported more than 25,000 eggs per 
hour under the cages of about 90,000 hens. 
</P>
<P>
 Other than company officials, there were no voters at the production plant 
tours. Reporters were even barred from one tour to protect company secrets. But 
Huffington said the day's events demonstrate that he is reaching out to workers 
and that he is a strong supporter of business. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is very important to me, because I think business is the key to 
prosperity in this country," Huffington said. "I don't get to meet a lot of 
people when I go through those things. But I am a pro-business person. So I go 
to businesses. . . . I'm promoting these people. These are good people. These 
are hard-working people."

FEDERAL JUDGE BANS SCHOOL PRAYER EXCEPT AT GRADUATION CEREMONIES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A state law allowing prayer at school-related activities is unconstitutional 
with one exception, high school graduation ceremonies, a federal judge ruled 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Henry T. Wingate ruled that the sweeping nature of the law 
made it unconstitutional, but that past court rulings defended prayer at 
graduations. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant Atty. Gen. Hunt Cole said the state will appeal. 
</P>
<P>
 The law, which took effect July 1, would have let students pray at 
school-related activities as long as they initiated it. The law also would have 
allowed voluntary "non-sectarian and non-proselytizing" benedictions and 
invocations. 
</P>
<P>
 The legislation was introduced after a Jackson school principal was suspended 
for allowing students to read prayers over the school intercom. 
</P>
<P>
 The law was challenged in July by the state chapter of the American Civil 
Liberties Union and People for the American Way on behalf of 14 parents and 
students. They contend the law violates the constitutional separation of church 
and state. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Supreme Court in 1963 declared school prayer unconstitutional. But a 
1992 U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals decision said voluntary, student-led and 
student-initiated prayers at commencement ceremonies are constitutional.

2 BOYS CHARGED IN GANG EXECUTION OF 11-YEAR-OLD 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEPHEN BRAUN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The tragic cycle of youthful violence that claimed the lives of 14-year-old 
Shavon Dean and Robert Sandifer Jr., the hardened 11-year-old suspect in her 
murder, came full circle Friday as Chicago police charged two teen-age brothers 
in the boy's execution. 
</P>
<P>
 Early Friday morning, detectives arrested Craig Hardaway, 16, and his 
unidentified 14-year-old brother at their home in Roseland, a community of 
ramshackle frame houses on Chicago's South Side. First-degree murder charges 
were filed against the pair in the killing of Sandifer, whose body was found 
Thursday morning in a bloody mud puddle under a pedestrian viaduct less than a 
mile from his home. 
</P>
<P>
 Identified as members of the Black Disciples street gang, the two brothers are 
accused of shooting the younger boy on orders of a superior in the 
organization, police said. One of the brothers has confessed, said police 
Commander Earl Nevels, who is heading the investigation into the deaths of Dean 
and Sandifer. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandifer was killed because he "had brought too much heat on the gang, and 
they feared that he might expose and implicate higher-ups," Nevels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Even as relatives and friends of the slain girl mourned at her funeral Friday 
and prayed that her death might galvanize gang members into reconsidering their 
lives, police said that the Black Disciples' use of adolescents as triggermen 
has become a common feature of gang life here. 
</P>
<P>
 There are 5,000 Black Disciple members throughout the city, said George Knox, 
director of the National Gang Crime Research Center at Chicago State 
University. Of that number, 20% are younger than 13, while most of the gang's 
"ministers" -- those who run its decentralized fiefs -- are in their 30s or 
40s, Knox said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's tragedy upon tragedy upon tragedy," said Cook County State's Atty. Jack 
O'Malley, commenting on the tender ages of the suspects and their victims. 
</P>
<P>
 Sandifer, known as "Yummy," had bragged about his affiliation with the Black 
Disciples since he was 10, neighbors said. Similarly, the two brothers accused 
of killing him had become members at 10, a law enforcement official said. 
</P>
<P>
 Craig Hardaway had no criminal record until this year, when he was arrested in 
a series of incidents. In May, according to officials, Hardaway was released by 
a juvenile judge after he was charged with attempted murder, discharging a 
firearm, aggravated battery and armed violence. A month earlier he had been 
placed on probation for auto theft and had also been arrested for narcotics 
distribution. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives and neighbors said that in the two days after a stray shot believed 
to have come from Robert Sandifer's gun killed Dean during an attempted 
drive-by shooting, the 11-year-old had been on the run. 
</P>
<P>
 Shepherded between safe houses and vacant dwellings by older gang members, the 
boy thought his friends were "going to get him out of town," Nevels said. 
</P>
<P>
 At one point, the young suspect may have considered turning himself in to 
police, said Frances Middlebrooks, an elderly neighbor. In an account given to 
a Chicago television station, Middlebrooks said that Sandifer turned up on her 
porch Wednesday night but left with several youths. 
</P>
<P>
 About two hours later, shortly after midnight Thursday, the boy was driven by 
three Black Disciples to the darkened, graffiti-marred viaduct and coaxed out 
of the car. "He had no idea what was about to happen," Nevels said. 
</P>
<P>
 Saying nothing, Nevels said, Hardaway allegedly fired a .25-caliber handgun 
twice into the back of the boy's head. 
</P>
<P>
 Times researcher John Beckham in Chicago contributed to this story.

SUSPECT IN ROSA PARKS' ROBBERY CASE RECOGNIZED HER, POLICE SAY 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A man accused of breaking into civil rights pioneer Rosa Parks' house did not 
know she lived there, but recognized her once inside, police said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "He said: 'Aren't you Rosa Parks?' She said, 'Yeah,' and he went ahead and 
robbed her anyway," Detroit Police Investigator Daniel Budz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Joseph Skipper, 28, was arraigned Friday on three charges: two counts of 
breaking and entering and unarmed robbery, and one count of breaking and 
entering with intent to commit larceny. The charges involve three alleged 
burglaries of elderly women's homes. 
</P>
<P>
 Magistrate Margaret E. Baylor entered a plea of not guilty for Skipper, who 
faces up to 15 years in prison on the charges, and ordered him held on $150,000 
bond. 
</P>
<P>
 Skipper also had an outstanding $5,000 bond for failing to appear in court in 
July on a charge he had broken into a church on Christmas Day. 
</P>
<P>
 Skipper declined comment outside the courthouse. A preliminary hearing was 
scheduled for Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks, 81, was beaten Tuesday and robbed of $53. She was treated at a hospital 
and released several hours later. 
</P>
<P>
 Assistant prosecutor Tim Kenny said Skipper has confessed to breaking into 
Parks' house as well as the homes of a 78-year-old woman and an 84-year-old 
woman. 
</P>
<P>
 Skipper's mother, Lula Skipper, said jail might be the best place for her son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want him to get better and get off the drugs, but it's going to take time 
for him to get straightened out," she said. 
</P>
<P>
 But police are worried that jail could be dangerous for Skipper, who already 
faced an angry mob when he was arrested because of the alleged assault on the 
revered civil rights figure. 
</P>
<P>
 "They tried beating him up on the street. You can imagine what they'll try to 
do in jail," Budz said. 
</P>
<P>
 Skipper was escorted to and from the court by two Detroit police officers and 
was being kept away from others at the Wayne County Jail, Budz said. He 
declined to say whether Skipper has been threatened. 
</P>
<P>
 Parks helped launch the civil rights movement in 1955 when she refused to give 
up her seat on a bus to a white man. She has lived in Detroit since 1957.

KILLER EXECUTED IN NEBRASKA; FIRST IN 35 YEARS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

From Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Harold LaMont Otey, convicted of raping a woman, beating her with a hammer and 
stabbing her to death, was executed early Friday in Nebraska's first execution 
in 35 years. 
</P>
<P>
 Otey, 43, died in the electric chair for the 1977 rape and murder of Jane 
McManus of Omaha. 
</P>
<P>
 Otey initially confessed to killing McManus, 26, who had been stabbed 15 times 
and beaten in her home. He later recanted. 
</P>
<P>
 In his confession to police, Otey said he killed McManus in a panic after she 
confronted him during a robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 A final appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court to stay the execution failed 
Thursday. The justices voted 6 to 2 in a telephone conference call Thursday 
night. Justices John Paul Stevens and Ruth Bader Ginsburg would have granted 
the stay of execution, and Justice Stephen G. Breyer did not take part in the 
vote, said Ed Turner, a court spokesman. 
</P>
<P>
 The last execution in Nebraska was that of 20-year-old Charles Starkweather in 
1959 for a string of 11 killings across the state.

serenity on Westlake Lake.  
</P>
<P>
 Kill too much algae and light will cause weeds on the lake floor to sprout as 
much as six inches a day. Let the algae grow, and within days a green carpet 
will grow thick enough to prevent a duck from getting its feet wet crossing the 
lake.  
</P>
<P>
 "We've got some very difficult problems to deal with, both technically and 
financially," explained Schulman, president of the Westlake Lake Property Assn. 
"And we're devoting almost all of our time to solving them." 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the ever-regenerating algae, Schulman said the artificial 
lake's engineers have struggled daily to keep it full, despite losing up to 
1,000 gallons each minute to evaporation in the summer heat.  
</P>
<P>
 So far, Schulman said, they have been able to refill the lake fast enough to 
conceal the problem from the nearly 1,200 residents who gaze out at it every 
day.  
</P>
<P>
 The 150-acre lake, which straddles the border between Ventura and Los Angeles 
counties, remains a scene of tranquillity, where it is common to spy a blue 
heron in flight or a sailboat gliding gently along in the breeze.  
</P>
<P>
 Residents such as William Murphy say the beauty of the lake is a cure for the 
discomfort of summer swelter.  
</P>
<P>
 "In front of my house it may be summer, but in back of my house it's always 
fall," he said, the water lapping up against his deck. "You always feel a 
little bit cooler when you're looking out at the lake."  
</P>
<P>
 It has not, however, been a summer of calm for Schulman.  
</P>
<P>
 Normally, the water that fills the lake comes from the drainage of ground 
water in 18 square miles surrounding the lake. When the runoff is slow, 
engineers compensate by tapping into two wells that collect water from an 
aquifer.  
</P>
<P>
 Heavy rainfall two years ago provided enough runoff to keep the lake full for 
the entire summer, and the wells didn't operate all season. 
</P>
<P>
 This year, the wells began pumping during the first week in June and have not 
stopped. Even with water from the aquifer, the pumps are barely keeping pace.  
</P>
<P>
 The lake loses water in three ways: Evaporation, if unchecked, will drop the 
lake's surface five feet during the hottest summer months. Neighboring Westlake 
Golf Course, by virtue of a 30-year-old agreement, siphons off as much as 400 
gallons a minute to irrigate its greens.  
</P>
<P>
 And each day, a smaller amount is pushed over a 450-foot-long dam at the east 
end of the lake. 
</P>
<P>
 To keep up with the water loss, Schulman and members of the lake's water 
management committee have begun to talk about building a third well.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're trying to improve the efficiency of the two wells we've got, to get it 
to pull more water from the aquifer," Schulman said. "But now we have to 
consider a third well, which is a pretty expensive proposition." 
</P>
<P>
 Money for such a project would come from the yearly dues that residents around 
the lake are assessed. Schulman declined to say how much residents pay for lake 
upkeep. "You get what you pay for, and this is a beautiful lake," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Few realize the effort it takes to keep the lake beautiful.  
</P>
<P>
 "I really don't know that much about the maintenance of the lake," said Irving 
Wasserman, who lives on the island in the middle of the water. "I see them out 
there chopping away at the algae all the time, but that's about all."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Algae, Schulman's other main concern, is a problem at many lakes.  
</P>
<P>
 Last year on Lake Sherwood, algae grew with abandon. Dead layers of the 
brownish-green plant filled the air with an odor described by residents as 
"sewage-like."  
</P>
<P>
 On Westlake Lake, William Murphy said, the plant has at times grown so thick 
that residents have had a hard time maneuvering boats through it.  
</P>
<P>
 "Especially in the summer, it grows like crazy," he said.  
</P>
<P>
 Crosby Fentress, chairman of the property association's water management 
committee, explained that the algae feeds on dead weeds that have accumulated 
at the bottom in layers as thick as two feet.  
</P>
<P>
 And, he said, the reclaimed water frequently used to irrigate nearby 
neighborhoods drains into the lake. That water's nutrients help the algae grow 
even faster.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't eliminate it 100%," Fentress said. "You just have to try to keep it 
under control."  
</P>
<P>
 To do that, the property association purchased a $45,000 harvester machine, 
which chops the algae and sucks it off the surface of the lake.  
</P>
<P>
 Also, Schulman said, the caretakers use chemicals in small doses to address 
the problem.  
</P>
<P>
 "When the lake was new, they used enough chemicals to keep it like a swimming 
pool," Schulman said. "But they learned that if the lake surface was too clear, 
the light would speed up the growth of weeds at the bottom.  
</P>
<P>
 "It was a no-win situation," he said. "So now we steer away from using a lot 
of chemicals."  
</P>
<P>
 Bill Hanson, who for many years worked as the lake's engineer, called lake 
management a balancing act.  
</P>
<P>
 "Really, it's a scientific process," said Hanson, a chemical engineer. "If you 
manage it well, you end up with something really terrific." Lake Woes Westlake 
Lake, which straddles the border between L.A. and Ventura counties, is facing 
summertime woes: an ever-regenerating carpet of algae and rapid evaporation, 
which leads to a struggle to keep the man-made lake full.

NEW BOARD HEARING ON PHYSICIAN'S LICENSE URGED; MEDICINE: EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR 
QUESTIONS AN EARLIER RULING AGAINST REVOCATION. THE DOCTOR IS ACCUSED OF 
NEGLIGENCE IN THE DEATHS OF TWO WOMEN. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 In an unusual move, the state medical board's executive director has asked 
board members to reconsider their decision not to revoke the license of a Los 
Angeles doctor accused of incompetence and negligence in the deaths of two 
young women who underwent abortions at his clinics. 
</P>
<P>
 The Medical Board of California last month suspended Dr. Leo F. Kenneally's 
license for one year and placed him on 10 years' probation, noting that his 
family planning clinics in Pacoima and Central Los Angeles are among the few 
places where low-income women can get affordable abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 But the disciplinary action fell far short of the license cancellation sought 
by medical board Executive Director Dixon Arnett, who wants another hearing on 
Kenneally. 
</P>
<P>
 The medical board in 1990 charged Kenneally with failing to quickly call 
paramedics when an 18-year-old woman stopped breathing and suffered a cardiac 
arrest while undergoing an abortion in 1987. The woman was admitted to a 
hospital, where she died about two months later. 
</P>
<P>
 Board investigators also said Kenneally did not properly care for a 
22-year-old asthmatic woman who suffered a seizure during a 1986 abortion. 
Kenneally continued to perform the abortion rather than deal with the seizure, 
the board said. The woman later was taken to a hospital, where she was 
pronounced dead. 
</P>
<P>
 The board also accused Kenneally of mishandling five other abortions that 
resulted in injuries between 1988 and 1993. All five women suffered extensive 
hemorrhaging, and two had to undergo hysterectomies following the abortions. 
</P>
<P>
 In a May 27 ruling, Administrative Law Judge Milford A. Maron agreed Kenneally 
was negligent in the two deaths. But the judge wrote that Kenneally is an 
"unselfish and committed provider" of abortions in poor neighborhoods where few 
other doctors will perform them -- a factor which mitigated against canceling 
his license. 
</P>
<P>
 Kenneally operates Her Medical Clinics at 13309 Van Nuys Blvd. and 2700 
Figueroa St., and performed about 100,000 abortions in the past 10 years, 
according to the medical board. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In an Aug. 26 petition filed on Arnett's behalf, state Deputy Atty. Gen. 
Adrian K. Panton asked six members of the medical board to reconsider whether 
to revoke Kenneally's license, saying their decision failed to consider 
"significant deficiencies" in Kenneally's practice of medicine. 
</P>
<P>
 Panton said that in four of the five hemorrhage cases, Kenneally delayed in 
sending the women to local hospitals for emergency treatment. In the fifth 
case, the woman was in so much pain when released from a clinic that she 
fainted and collapsed an hour later in a fast-food restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
 "Given the fact that most of the hemorrhage cases occurred fairly recently, 
the decision's failure to address these deficiencies is striking since the 
protection of the public is the highest priority of (the medical board)," 
Panton said. 
</P>
<P>
 Panton also said the terms of Kenneally's probation were too lenient, urging 
that the physician be monitored by another doctor and required to undergo an 
intensive clinical training program and pass an exam. 
</P>
<P>
 In a petition opposing Panton, Kenneally's attorney, Jay N. Hartz, said it was 
unnecessary and unfair to force Kenneally to undergo another license hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartz also charged that the medical board had bowed to pressure from 
anti-abortion activists to discipline Kenneally, whose clinics and Canyon 
Country home have been picketed by members of Operation Rescue in the past. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartz said the chief board investigator in the Kenneally case had received 
about 50 phone calls from one anti-abortion activist and that various 
politicians opposed to abortion also wrote letters urging the board to punish 
Kenneally. 
</P>
<P>
 The board, Hartz said, was "being used by anti-abortion zealots as a tool of 
harassment against physicians who perform abortions." In a separate letter to 
board President Bruce Hasenkamp, Hartz urged that Arnett be removed from his 
job. 
</P>
<P>
 Board spokeswoman Candis Cohen acknowledged that "the board has heard" from 
anti-abortion workers but that "their input had no influence" on its decision. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Arnett said board members have 10 days to reply to his petition. He said he 
was confident that reconsideration would be granted. 
</P>
<P>
 He said board members did not have all the records on Kenneally's case before 
them when they reached their decision, although they did have the 
administrative law judge's opinion. If another hearing is convened, board 
members will be supplied with 38 boxes of materials, Arnett said.

CHRISTIAN FESTIVAL IN DEBT DUE TO APPARENT CHEATING; BURBANK: MANY TOOK 
ADVANTAGE TO GET INTO SUMMER PRAISE '94 FOR FREE, ORGANIZER SAYS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Last month's Christian music festival in Burbank ended $236,000 in debt due to 
what an organizer Friday called a "shocking and alarming" number of people 
cheating to get in free. 
</P>
<P>
 "You wouldn't expect that (at a Christian event), but it happened," complained 
Carey Wong of Glendale, one of the festival's two novice organizers. "It's very 
heartbreaking." 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said that although Summer Praise '94, held Aug. 11-14, won favorable 
comments from participants, the paid attendance totaled only 4,000 to 5,000 -- 
well below expectations. 
</P>
<P>
 People who paid were given plastic wristbands, which they could show to be 
readmitted if they left the festival or came back on another day, and were 
asked not to remove them, he said. But many people with cut or taped-together 
wristbands appeared at gates and offered various excuses for why the bands were 
not intact, Wong said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rather than question their truthfulness, the organizers admitted many who 
presented what were apparently unpaid wristbands, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, "some gates were unguarded or security was not checking people 
carefully," said Paul Hammack, one of the festival's promotion officials. 
Organizers also reported that food tickets and cases of meat were apparently 
stolen. 
</P>
<P>
 By late this week, Wong and his partner George Jerome, a Chatsworth 
businessman, had reduced the outstanding debt to $175,000. Some artists have 
volunteered to appear again in fund-raising events to help pay off more, said 
Hammack. 
</P>
<P>
 Wong said that as many as 8,500 people attended the final evening's events, 
featuring popular Christian vocalist Carman. 
</P>
<P>
 One speaker, preacher Carlton Pearson of Tulsa, Okla., urged the crowd on the 
final night to pay the full admission price voluntarily if they had not gotten 
in honestly. "Instead of accepting an honorarium for his appearance, Pearson 
wrote a $500 check to offset debts," Hammack said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 100-degree heat that weekend also apparently kept people away, Hammack 
said, noting that 942 pre-purchased tickets went unclaimed. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The festival, which featured dozens of well-known contemporary Christian 
musicians and singers, got off to a rocky start on Aug. 11 when Jerome threw a 
gay and lesbian evangelical group out of its booth for refusing to remove an 
identification sign that Jerome called offensive to other festival 
participants. He acted because the gay group refused to accept his authority 
over what it could display at the festival, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Would Wong, a financier and member of the First Chinese Baptist Church in 
Chinatown, organize another music festival? After a long pause, Wong said, 
"It's too early to comment on that."

<TEXT>
<P>
 The Granada Hills Library, heavily damaged in the Northridge earthquake, will 
reopen Tuesday at 12:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 The library has been closed since the January temblor. 
</P>
<P>
 It cost an estimated $250,000 to repair the facility, according to Nina 
Wilson, regional manager for the West Valley region of the Los Angeles Public 
Library system. 
</P>
<P>
 The Granada Hills branch suffered interior, exterior and water damage in the 
quake. 
</P>
<P>
 At least 2,500 books were destroyed. 
</P>
<P>
 Repairs include new roofing, ceiling lights, carpeting, air conditioning and 
interior paint. 
</P>
<P>
 The library was also strengthened structurally to meet current seismic 
requirements. 
</P>
<P>
 The branch is also now equipped to accommodate a computerized data system, 
which will be implemented in the next year or so. 
</P>
<P>
 The library will be open Monday and Saturday from 10 a.m. to 5:30 p.m.; 
Tuesday and Thursday from 12:30 to 8 p.m.; and Wednesday and Friday from 12:30 
to 5:30 p.m. It is at 10640 Petit Ave. ALICIA DOYLE

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: WOODLAND HILLS; DRIVER'S SEEING RED OVER SLOW ON-RAMP METER 
</P>

<P>
 "Mommmmmmm! I'm gonna be late for school," whines the 11-year-old son of 
devoted mother, office worker and exasperated commuter Toni Slee of Woodland 
Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 At the moment, she is entrapped in the family car and stuck in a mire of 
motionless cars, all funneling toward the southbound on-ramp to the Ventura 
Freeway at Winnetka Avenue. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mommmmmmm, come on," that pre-pubescent voice keeps demanding. Slee looks at 
the clock: It is 7:35 a.m., and she and other drivers have been waiting in line 
for eight minutes now to make it onto the freeway. 
</P>
<P>
 They are all at the mercy of the traffic signal at the top of the ramp, the 
one that seems to take forever to turn from red to green, one car at a time 
only, please. 
</P>
<P>
 This has been Slee's daily routine, but she is not going to take it anymore. 
</P>
<P>
 In June, Slee filed complaints about the signal with Caltrans, the engineer 
who works for the agency, and the city of Los Angeles. A week later, Slee said, 
the Winnetka Avenue meter was turned off. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic improved considerably. But not for long. 
</P>
<P>
 Six weeks later, the meter was on again. Slee discovered it had only been 
disarmed temporarily for repairs. Her letters hadn't shut down the hateful 
thing; it was just coincidence. 
</P>
<P>
 Caltrans spokesman Rick Holland said the Winnetka Avenue signal could indeed 
be slower than other signals in the city. "The timing is determined by the 
traffic flow. . . . Once the traffic gets heavier the light speeds up," said 
Holland. "It's mostly done with sensors." 
</P>
<P>
 He didn't rule out the possibility that the Winnetka sensor may be broken. 
</P>
<P>
 Slee noted that not only is the entry process slow, commuters are often left 
stranded in the middle of the intersection when the signal light turns red. 
</P>
<P>
 "Then there are those people who get sick of waiting and take the car-pool 
lane," Slee said, even though they are not carrying any passengers. "I know 
that if I even started to think of getting in the car-pool lane, the police 
would see me." 
</P>
<P>
 A ticket would set her back nearly $300. MAKI BECKER

WEST VALLEY FOCUS: CALABASAS; MALL PLANS FORCING EVICTION OF TENANTS 
</P>

<P>
 Arden Group Inc. plans to tear down the aging Woodland Plaza Shopping Center 
on Mulholland Highway to make room for a new mall anchored by a Gelson's 
Markets food store.  
</P>
<P>
 Compton-based Arden Group owns both Woodland Plaza and the Gelson's Markets 
chain of upscale supermarkets.There is just one problem: Several Woodland Plaza 
tenants who are being evicted say their leases are not up yet -- and they don't 
want to leave. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden Group said Woodland Plaza stores won't be able to operate while the new 
center is under construction. The firm said it will help relocate tenants, but 
can't promise them space in the new mall.  
</P>
<P>
 "At this point we don't know how much space we're going to have," said Ernest 
T. Klinger, Arden Group's vice president and chief financial officer.  
</P>
<P>
 Arden Group acquired the center in a foreclosure sale in November, 1993, 
Klinger said. Many tenants were angry about the company's decision to rebuild 
the mall now, saying the 30-day eviction notices they received recently give 
them little time to find other locations. 
</P>
<P>
 "They don't care," said Lela Pettey, who operates Lela's Hair Salon. "It's 
just this big company against these little people, and money talks." 
</P>
<P>
 Angela Sung, whose family operates Woodland 1 Cleaners, said Arden Group's 
decision to tear down the old center didn't come as a complete shock. But "I 
never expected it to happen like this," she said. Her family signed a five-year 
lease two years ago.  
</P>
<P>
 Pettey, who has been a tenant at the center since 1982, had hoped to stay put 
for perhaps another 10 years. She recently spent $35,000 on renovations. 
</P>
<P>
 "I want to come back," she said. "I'm a good tenant, I have a good business."

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: SUN VALLEY; NEIGHBORS, SOCCER GROUP CITE PROBLEMS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Littering, drinking and noisemaking in a Sun Valley neighborhood have set a 
local Neighborhood Watch against a youth soccer group, although both sides say 
they want to solve the problem. 
</P>
<P>
 Paul Bobek, head of a Sun Valley Neighborhood Watch, said that when the youth 
soccer group started playing at the Sun Valley Middle School on weekends, 
several problems in that neighborhood increased. Bobek cited parking problems, 
public drinking, as well as diapers and beer cans being strewn on neighbors' 
lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Alcala, who started the Sun Valley Youth Soccer Group after waiting three 
years for the school district's permission, said the trouble is not caused by 
his group, but is a long-standing problem caused by weekend trespassers at the 
school. He started the soccer group to give the kids an alternative to drugs 
and crime. The youths play Saturdays and the adults who teach them play 
Sundays. 
</P>
<P>
 Emilio Garcia, the middle school principal, said he did not know who was 
causing the problem, but that the soccer group takes good care of the field and 
school grounds. "On Monday mornings, the campus is exceptionally clean," Garcia 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday night, Councilman Richard Alarcon held a meeting between the two 
groups. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just a problem of a lack of communication," said Alarcon spokesman 
Arturo Gonzales. Alarcon's office is trying to arrange further meetings between 
the two sides. 
</P>
<P>
 Bobek said Alcala has worsened the problem by defining it as whites who object 
to a Latino activity. He said Alcala came to a recent Neighborhood Watch 
meeting and said whites should move out if they do not like how the community 
is changing. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a lie, I never said that," Alcala said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm Hispanic," said Vickie Aguilar, a Neighborhood Watch member who lives 
near the school and supports Bobek. "There is no prejudice at all. We just 
don't want all the noise from the men." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguilar said she does not have any complaints about the youths playing soccer, 
but that adult players block driveways with their cars, drink beer and urinate 
on neighbors' lawns. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, both sides expressed regret that the issue threatened to split 
apart the community. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to keep our community together," Bobek said.  
</P>
<P>
 Alcala, who lives a block from the school, said soccer players and the adults 
in the group park their cars on the school grounds. They also are required to 
clean up the school property after playing. He said they also hope to organize 
neighborhood cleanups. 
</P>
<P>
 Alcala added that he is the first person to call police when he sees someone 
drinking or breaking the law. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of things we can do as a community," Alcala said. "I think it's 
a waste of time. We could be using all this energy to do other things instead 
of fighting." ED BOND

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: VAN NUYS; FUNDS TO PREVENT NEW FLOOD AT COLLEGE OKD

<P>
 Faulty water pressure regulators that caused flooding at Valley College will 
be repaired, thanks to a measure approved this week by the Los Angeles 
Community College District. 
</P>
<P>
 The district's board of trustees voted unanimously to authorize $30,000 to 
replace eight water pressure regulators. The contract, passed under emergency 
resolution, was awarded to Levko Plumbing Co. 
</P>
<P>
 On Aug. 11, two water pressure regulators failed at the Van Nuys community 
college, causing utility tunnels to flood. The water level in the tunnels rose 
to within an inch of electrical transformers. 
</P>
<P>
 The work is expected to be completed during the Labor Day weekend in order to 
prevent failure of the temporary repairs and to avoid endangering the electric 
transformers again. JEFF SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: L.A.-BAKERSFIELD RAIL LINE TO BE DISCUSSED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Caltrans officials will conduct a public hearing Wednesday on plans for 
high-speed rail service between Los Angeles and Bakersfield via routes that 
could crisscross the San Fernando Valley.  
</P>
<P>
 The meeting will take place at the Gene Autry Western Heritage Museum, 4700 
Zoo Drive, Los Angeles, from 5 to 8 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Michalak, Caltrans chief of public transportation and rail, will discuss 
a study that examines the proposed train's technologies, routes, stations, cost 
estimates and preliminary engineering. 
</P>
<P>
 The $4-million study was funded under the Clean Air and Transportation 
Efficiency Act. 
</P>
<P>
 It examines routes between Los Angeles and Bakersfield through two major 
corridors for high-speed ground transportation, according to the California 
Department of Transportation. Possible routes could pass through Glendale, 
Burbank, San Fernando, Santa Clarita, Palmdale, Lancaster and Tehachapi. 
</P>
<P>
 The study concludes that the Los Angeles-to-Bakersfield system would cost 
between $170 million and $240 million a year to operate. This cost assumes a 
total of 20 trains operating 76 trips in each direction each day. 
</P>
<P>
 Construction of the rail system is not expected to begin until 2000. 
</P>
<P>
 Information on the draft feasibility study may be obtained by writing to Mark 
Archuleta, Public Transportation/Rail Branch, Caltrans, District 7, 120 S. 
Spring St., Los Angeles CA 90012. 
</P>
<P>
 A summary of the study's findings is available at the following libraries: Los 
Angeles Central, Burbank, Beale Memorial, Palmdale, Newhall and Lancaster.

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: EXTENSION LIKELY ON FREE DEBRIS REMOVAL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The city of Los Angeles is likely to extend its free earthquake debris removal 
program through Jan. 17, a city official said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Project manager Andres Santamaria of the Public Works Department said the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency has verbally agreed to extend the program, 
currently scheduled to end Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 FEMA has already committed $110 million to the program. Extending it through 
the first anniversary of the Northridge temblor would cost the agency an 
additional $70 million, Santamaria said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city will make a formal announcement about the extension Tuesday.  
</P>
<P>
 "We're very relieved because there is a real need for this type of extension," 
Santamaria said. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: NORTH HILLS; CITY RELAXES RESTRICTIONS ON REDWOOD INN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF SCHNAUFER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 City officials have lifted some restrictions imposed earlier this year on a 
North Hills motel that were intended to alleviate crime, saying the measures 
appear to have worked.  
</P>
<P>
 But the motel's owners are not happy. 
</P>
<P>
 At a hearing Aug. 26, Associate Zoning Administrator John Parker told owners 
of the Redwood Inn on Sepulveda Boulevard that they can reduce their on-site 
security from seven days a week to just Friday and Saturday nights. 
</P>
<P>
 Parker cited a police report saying that two undercover sting operations at 
the motel conducted since the security restrictions were imposed in March 
failed to produce any illegal activities. In addition, he called the 
16-hour-a-day security guard a financial burden. 
</P>
<P>
 "A security guard is a major expense for a small motel," Parker said Friday. 
"And the police didn't indicate that they were in violation of anything." 
</P>
<P>
 For the past three years, police said, the motel had been frequented by 
prostitutes. Last year, this prompted city officials to order motel owners to 
hire a security guard and comply with a list of 25 other conditions in order to 
stay in business. 
</P>
<P>
 One of those conditions, not renting a room for less than a day, was intended 
to keep out prostitutes. Last week, motel owners failed to convince Parker to 
eliminate that condition, saying they are turning away truck drivers who need a 
place to sleep for a few hours. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel we are a victim," said Jui Tsai, a spokeswoman for her father, Redwood 
Inn owner Yung Jung. "We know there were some criminals in our area, but we 
can't go out and arrest those people. We think they should take away all the 
conditions from our motel." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tom Henry, planning deputy for City Councilman Joel Wachs, said the 
conditions should remain in place until police and city officials are convinced 
that the motel is no longer a magnet for crime. 
</P>
<P>
 Henry also pointed out that the city has ordered four other motels along 
Sepulveda to hire security guards. Three of those motels have appealed the 
decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems that the conditions have worked," Henry said. "It's another sign 
that, slowly but surely, maybe we can clean up Sepulveda Boulevard." JEFF 
SCHNAUFER

VALLEYWIDE FOCUS: 3 ARRESTED ON AUTO THEFT; SHOT FIRED

<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley police arrested two San Fernando Valley men and a 15-year-old boy 
on suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle after a brief pursuit and foot chase 
during which an officer shot at one of the men. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident, which marked the first officer-involved 
shooting in Simi Valley since December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Cratch, the 23-year-old officer who fired his gun, has been placed on 
paid leave while the shooting is investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the incident began about 11:30 p.m. Thursday, when Cratch 
tried to stop a white Chevrolet Suburban for driving erratically. The driver 
sped up, turning north on Stearns Street and west on Barnard Street, then 
stopping east of Kadota Street. 
</P>
<P>
 During the chase, Cratch saw a metal object thrown from the vehicle and 
suspected it was a handgun. Police now believe the object was actually a beer 
can, said Sgt. Mike King. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vehicle stopped, two men jumped out and ran into a field. Cratch 
chased the two men and fired one shot from his 9-millimeter gun as one of the 
suspects abruptly turned toward him, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Cratch thought the suspect was armed, but no guns have 
been found in the field or on any of the suspects, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officers arriving for backup captured 23-year-old Paul Morre of Panorama City 
a quarter of a mile from the scene of the shooting. The other man who fled the 
car has not been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested on suspicion of auto theft were Gevorg Gouyoumjian, 22, of 
Arleta and a 15-year-old boy from Canoga Park. Both Gouyoumjian and the boy 
remained in the stolen vehicle after the pursuit.  
</P>
<P>
 The Suburban was reported stolen from Los Angeles on Sunday. JULIE FIELDS

 Lady Luck smiled upon a Glendale businessman Friday, when he won $100,000 in 
the lottery. 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel great," said Serjik Gholi, who said he could hardly believe his good 
fortune."Once I receive the check I will believe it." 
</P>
<P>
 Gholi's lucky scratcher ticket, purchased at an Alpha Beta Market in Glendale, 
made him eligible to play the Big Spin game on Friday. The 34-year-old selected 
two matching squares from a game board, which allowed him to spin the big money 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 A flick of the wrist netted him $100,000 -- the fourth-largest amount on the 
wheel. 
</P>
<P>
 The owner of a business that sells fire-sprinkler systems, Gholi said his 
immediate plans are to take family and friends out for a celebration dinner. 
Next, he said, he will help his parents buy a house, and buy himself a car to 
replace one that was stolen two weeks ago. 
</P>
<P>
 Gholi will receive a lump-sum check for about $72,000 after taxes. KAY HWANGBO

EAST VALLEY FOCUS: TOLUCA LAKE; CAFE OWNER ARRESTED AFTER THROWING FOOD 
</P>

<P>
 Misdemeanor charges may be filed against a cafe owner who hurled a container 
of food at a health inspector and was later arrested and booked for battery, 
authorities said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Romelia Issakhanian, owner of the trendy Cafe du Soleil on Riverside Drive in 
Toluca Lake, had a belligerent history toward health officials, forcing the 
inspector to bring along a supervisor for protection, according to the county 
Department of Health Services. 
</P>
<P>
 "She apparently gets somewhat upset when health inspectors come by. It's not 
uncommon. It's uncommon when they get physical with our people," said Carl 
Charles, who oversees the agency's restaurant inspections. 
</P>
<P>
 Issakhanian, 41, declined to discuss the incident, but said: "I am not some 
criminal." 
</P>
<P>
 Inspector Bessie Gallanis and her supervisor, Grainne Clarke, found 22 safety 
violations during their unexpected visit Thursday, including the improper sale 
of turkey and chicken prepared at Issakhanian's Burbank home. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said the cafe owner willingly threw most of it into the trash, but 
hurled a container of the food at Gallanis, hitting the inspector in the knee. 
Clarke said she and Gallanis fled to phone police. 
</P>
<P>
 County health officials said they expect to have misdemeanor charges related 
to the food violations filed against Issakhanian. The Burbank city attorney's 
office may also file a misdemeanor charge of battery, which is punishable by up 
to six months in jail, a maximum $2,000 fine, or both. 
</P>
<P>
 Clarke said the cafe owner has acted violently toward health officials three 
times before, but declined to elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The inspector was quite shaken by the whole situation," she said. "It was 
quite traumatic." VIVIEN LOU CHEN

12-YEAR-OLD ARRESTED IN SHOOTING; GUNS: PACOIMA BOY IS IN CRITICAL CONDITION 
AFTER WHAT POLICE BELIEVE WAS AN ACCIDENT LATE THURSDAY WHILE THE YOUNGSTERS 
PLAYED WITH A REVOLVER IN A VAN NUYS HOME.

<P>
 A 12-year-old boy who accidentally shot his 14-year-old friend in the head was 
arrested on suspicion of attempted murder Friday, and his friend was 
hospitalized in critical condition, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The younger boy said he had found the gun in Delano Park about a week ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The victim, 14-year-old Victor Tamayo of Pacoima remained in critical 
condition at Northridge Hospital Medical Center late Friday with a single 
gunshot wound to the head, authorities said. The wound is not believed to be 
life-threatening. 
</P>
<P>
 Detectives believe the shooting occurred while the two were playing with the 
revolver, but police said they arrested the youngster partly because he had 
lied about his involvement earlier, Detective John Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have no reason to believe that this was anything other than an accident, 
but we are continuing to investigate," Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting occurred Thursday about midnight when Tamayo and his friend were 
playing at the friend's home with a loaded .38-caliber Colt revolver, police 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend shot Tamayo from about six feet away while the two were sitting on 
a couch watching a video movie, Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
 The friend's father was sleeping in the next room, but did not awake, Edwards 
said. "The father has two jobs, and was just really exhausted," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After the shooting, the friend called 911, then awoke his father, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, the friend told police that Tamayo had accidentally shot himself. 
But after being questioned, the youngster admitted he had accidentally pulled 
the trigger, police said. 
</P>
<P>
 The boys had looked into the cylinder of the gun and mistakenly believed all 
the chambers were empty, Edwards said. Actually, four of the chambers contained 
bullets. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12-year-old was released to the custody of his parents and is scheduled to 
be arraigned next week.

METROPOLITAN DIGEST / LOS ANGELES COUNTY NEWS IN BRIEF: SAN PEDRO; 2 CRUISES 
ARE CANCELED AS CAUSE OF ILLNESS IS SOUGHT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The San Pedro-based cruise ship on which hundreds of passengers became ill 
will remain in port while federal investigators continue their search for the 
cause of the outbreak. 
</P>
<P>
 A spokesman for the Royal Caribbean Cruise Line said the company canceled two 
Ensenada cruises, one scheduled to depart Friday and one Monday, because the 
cause of the illness had not yet been determined.This weekend, the federal 
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention will test blood and stool samples 
collected from passengers, as well as samples from the ship's water supply, to 
find the source of the ailment, which forced the Viking Serenade back to port 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
 More than 400 of the Viking's 2,350 passengers and crew reported symptoms such 
as vomiting and diarrhea, and one 78-year-old man died -- apparently of a heart 
attack -- after he fell ill and was hospitalized in Ensenada. 
</P>
<P>
 Three passengers were hospitalized in San Pedro on Friday in fair condition, 
said a spokeswoman for San Pedro Peninsula Hospital. Five people admitted 
earlier to an Ensenada hospital were transferred to a hospital in San Diego.

 The plane was returning from Mammoth Lakes, where the passengers had attended 
a meeting with school officials. 
</P>
<P>
 The accident occurred at 3:14 p.m. Thursday as the plane was landing, 
according to authorities at the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department's 
Antelope Valley Station. 
</P>
<P>
 Pilot Laszlo Peterfai, 28, decided the plane was not correctly lined up with 
the runway and tried to abort the landing, but the plane lost power, 
authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The right wing of the twin-engine Cessna 310 hit the ground and the plane spun 
sideways. The right engine caught fire, but an off-duty firefighter who 
witnessed the crash used a fire extinguisher to put out the flames, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 On board the plane were Acton-Agua Dulce Unified School District Supt. Tom 
Brown, school board member Julie Feurhelm, Acton Town Council member Jim 
Duzick, who chairs the district's alternate high school site committee, and 
Agua Dulce-Acton Country Journal Editor Lillian Smith. 
</P>
<P>
 The passengers and the pilot were able to get out of the plane without 
sustaining serious injury, said sheriff's officials. 
</P>
<P>
 Feurhelm and Smith were taken to Henry Mayo Newhall Memorial Hospital in Santa 
Clarita, where they were treated for minor injuries and released, said Patti 
Fleetwood, a hospital spokeswoman. Brown and Duzick were treated for minor cuts 
at the scene. Peterfai was not injured. 
</P>
<P>
 The school district officials, who are searching for potential school sites 
for the area's first high school, had met with Mammoth High School officials 
about an expansion in their district.

SANTA CLARITA / ANTELOPE VALLEY; OLD DESERTED SHOP MAY GO UP IN SMOKE; SANTA 
CLARITA: ONCE THE ONLY NEARBY GENERAL STORE, DILLENBECK'S MARKET HAS BECOME AN 
EYESORE. NEIGHBORS WANT IT DEMOLISHED. FIRE OFFICIALS ARE READY TO HELP. 
</P>

<P>
 For decades, Dillenbeck's Market was a family-run, all-purpose general store 
in a remote area where the few nearby residents could drop in for the latest 
gossip and buy everything from milk to farming equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 More recently, it has been an eyesore -- an eyesore that may soon go up in 
smoke. 
</P>
<P>
 Modern shopping complexes dominate the site at one of the city's busiest 
intersections, and the structure that used to be Dillenbeck's has been 
abandoned for about a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 People who live in nearby condos and houses that have sprung up since the 
market closed have complained often about transients, gang members and others 
who use the deteriorating building as a shelter or party house. They, along 
with city officials, would like to see the store demolished. 
</P>
<P>
 "People just don't want to see it anymore," said Ruben Barrera, a city 
building official. "Some people are saying it is devaluing the surrounding 
property." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 City codes allow authorities to request the property's owners to demolish the 
building, he said. But the building's owners, who live in Los Angeles, told 
city officials they did not have the $5,000 to $10,000 that demolition would 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
 So now, city officials want to burn it down, saving thousands of dollars in 
the process. The Los Angeles County Fire Department is ready to oblige. Fire 
officials want to burn the old store as a training exercise, which has been 
done on occasion with other buildings, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 The city had the option of demolishing the building and billing the owners. 
However, Barrera estimated allowing firefighters to burn it down will cost less 
than $2,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The store on the northwest corner of Soledad Canyon Road and Sierra Highway 
was opened shortly after World War II by Charlie Dillenbeck, one of the few 
residents in what is now Canyon Country, said Jerry Reynolds, curator of the 
Santa Clarita Valley Historical Society. 
</P>
<P>
 "In those days it was very isolated," Reynolds said. "It was one of the only 
locations you could get to to do any shopping." 
</P>
<P>
 The area's population began growing in the 1960s, but "a sort of loyalty among 
the old-timers" kept the store going until it shut down when Dillenbeck became 
ill, Reynolds said. 
</P>
<P>
 The current owners have cooperated with city officials in boarding up the 
property when trouble has arisen, but complaints continue to surface every few 
months, Barrera said.  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Steve Kerekes, the agent for the owners, was unavailable for comment, but 
Barrera said they have agreed to allow the building to be burned. 
</P>
<P>
 The fire exercise was scheduled for this weekend, but has been delayed while 
investigators determine whether there is asbestos or any other hazard in the 
building that could harm firefighters, said Fire Department Battalion Chief 
Dave Moore. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition, the South Coast Air Quality Management District must decide 
whether weather conditions are suitable to allow the smoke to dissipate during 
the burning, Barrera said. 
</P>
<P>
 Reynolds said the building's destruction will mean the loss of a local 
landmark, but in its current state he isn't too disappointed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an interesting place but doesn't qualify as a historic structure," he 
said.

MARCHERS WARY ABOUT VIETNAM TIES; PROTEST: O.C. RESIDENTS ARE AMONG 1,000 IN 
WASHINGTON TO MARK COMMUNISTS' ENTRY INTO HANOI 49 YEARS AGO.

 The nation's capital was a virtual ghost town Friday with Congress in recess, 
the President vacationing on Martha's Vineyard and the city practically 
disengaged for the holiday weekend. But a thousand or so Vietnamese 
demonstrators marched and chanted anyway, the significance of the date more 
important than the reality that there might be very few in town to hear them. 
</P>
<P>
 It was 49 years ago Friday that the communist Viet Minh first marched into 
Hanoi, and the protesters who came by bus and plane from as far away as Orange 
County, Houston and Canada could not let the anniversary pass without voicing 
concern over the Clinton Administration's moves toward normalizing relations 
with Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 This was not the largest demonstration to assemble since President Clinton 
lifted the trade embargo against Vietnam in February, but activists said it was 
the largest yet to converge upon the nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
 "The date is very significant to them," said Joe Jordan, a Vietnam War veteran 
and POW activist who stood by in reverent support of the marchers, wearing 
combat gear and holding the yellow and red flag of the fallen Republic of 
Vietnam. "It doesn't matter what the weather was or whether or not anybody was 
here." 
</P>
<P>
 The demonstrators walked 16 blocks from the Capitol to the White House -- 
doctors, lawyers, housewives, children, mothers-to-be, even a cocker spaniel -- 
toting banners and chanting demands for freedom in Vietnam. 
</P>
<P>
 Three men attempted a human re-creation of the three-soldier statue that 
stands at the Vietnam Memorial, their faces and combat fatigues stained bronze. 
But the idea was foiled when authorities confiscated two assault weapons they 
planned to use as props. (One was said to have been disabled and the other a 
toy, but police took them nevertheless.) They delivered to the White House 
staff a stack of petitions opposing the impending opening of the Hanoi Liaison 
Office in Washington, which will officially recognize and facilitate relations 
with that communist seat of power. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are here to remind people that it is OK to have relations, but you cannot 
take the communists at their word. If you don't learn that lesson from history, 
you have learned nothing," said Dat Vo, a Santa Ana internist who came to the 
United States at age 10 with his family after Saigon fell. He marched with his 
father. 
</P>
<P>
 Vo was one of 28 to fly in from Orange County, home of the largest 
concentration of Vietnamese Americans in the country and an immigrant community 
divided over the wisdom of recognizing Hanoi's communist leadership. 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Times Poll found recently that more than half the Vietnamese 
living in Southern California favor normalization, many believing that 
fostering a healthy business climate will improve the quality of life in 
Vietnam and lead to democracy. But many of those in favor hesitate to say so, 
fearing they will be socially or politically banished. 
</P>
<P>
 "We understand the resentment, but we have to overcome our pain of the past," 
Co Pham, a physician and outspoken advocate of normalization, said in a phone 
interview even as half a dozen picketers staged their own protest outside his 
Westminster office. 
</P>
<P>
 "One thousand (marchers) is not a very big number. There are 1 million 
Vietnamese in the United States," Pham said, suggesting that a silent majority 
favors re-establishing relations and helping Vietnamese overseas in the 
process. "There are different ways to skin the cat." 
</P>
<P>
 But the demonstrators who marched in yellow headbands, their symbol of 
mourning for those who died fighting communism, preached at the very least 
caution as Washington reaches out to Hanoi. They said they left family still 
living in Vietnam without religious freedom, monks jailed and dissidents in 
labor camps, even as much of the rest of the communist world breaks free. 
</P>
<P>
 "In Eastern Europe there are free elections and a free market to give people 
the freedom to choose their government and pursue human happiness. 
Unfortunately, things have not changed in Vietnam," Tien V. Doan, a Westminster 
attorney, said as the march began. "We want you to return to Vietnam a victor. 
. . . Fifty thousand Americans were lost in Vietnam. It's like their lives were 
wasted."

 TARGET ON TV: Westminster's acclaimed anti-gang program, TARGET, will be part 
of a KNBC Channel 4 documentary on crime . . . "We feel this program has been 
extremely effective in working with the citizen to remove criminal gang members 
from the city," said Police Chief James Cook. The series, "Victory Over 
Violence," starts today.TARGET will be featured in a segment at 1 p.m. Sept. 
17. 
</P>
<P>
 TARGET RUNWAY: How do airline pilots ensure perfect landings? They practice -- 
and have spot-landing contests. Brad Englund of Fullerton won the most recent 
contest at Fullerton Municipal Airport, held by its Pilots Assn. . . . . 
Airport officials say such contests promote accurate and safe landings among 
pilots. Englund attributes his success to his experience as a hang glider: 
"When you hang glide, you don't have the power of an engine so you have to be 
really careful with the landing. You have to stop in the right place."

SCHOOL, FATHER STILL HAGGLING OVER O.C. BOY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JODI WILGOREN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

 Just days before school is scheduled to begin, Jim Peters spent Friday 
haggling with school officials over special accommodations for his 6-year-old 
son Jimmy, a learning disabled youngster who last spring was thrust into the 
center of an unprecedented legal battle over mainstreaming special education 
students. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View School District administrators have spent weeks -- and $5,000 -- 
training Jimmy's teacher and preparing his classroom at Circle View Elementary, 
but Peters said he now may try to enroll the child at Golden View Elementary, 
where he believes the principal is more amenable to his educational philosophy. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just want to make sure we can make a fresh start with Jimmy," said Peters, 
a longtime special education activist and current candidate for the Ocean View 
school board. "I'm out to make this work, but the district doesn't want to make 
it work." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Peters asked administrators to move Jimmy's planned class at Circle 
View to a different room, replace some of the students in the class with 
children more sympathetic to his son, and hire Jimmy's baby-sitter as an 
instructional aide. At Golden View, he asked the principal to convert a 
kindergarten room into a combination K-1 class. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said Friday they would not make last-minute changes to 
accommodate one student, noting that they had sent the Circle View teacher, who 
has a special education background, to numerous workshops this summer on 
student behavior problems and how to teach disabled and mainstream children 
simultaneously. 
</P>
<P>
 The training for Jimmy's teacher and other staff who will work with him, along 
with a contract with a separate specialist, cost the district about $5,000, 
Ocean View Supt. James R. Tarwater said. 
</P>
<P>
 "In 28 years, I've never had so much regression in decision-making. Every time 
you go in one direction, it gets switched," said a frustrated Tarwater. "We're 
trying to make it work, but (Peters) has to work with us. Pulling out to 
another school two days before is proof . . . that he doesn't wish to 
cooperate." 
</P>
<P>
 Jimmy, who suffers from a communications disorder of disputed severity, 
attended a special education class at Circle View for preschool, then, last 
year, joined a regular kindergarten class as part of the growing movement 
toward "full inclusion" of children with special needs. 
</P>
<P>
 Administrators tried to remove Jimmy from the class last spring, claiming he 
was constantly disruptive and had several violent outbursts, but Peters refused 
to put him in a special class. 
</P>
<P>
 After Jimmy bit his teacher in May, sending her home on stress leave, the 
district took the locally unprecedented step of filing a lawsuit against Jimmy 
in a last-ditch effort to oust him from the class. But a judge sent him back 
for the final days of school amid protests from parents of his classmates, some 
of whom pulled their children out of school when Jimmy returned. 
</P>
<P>
 Peters said he made his requests weeks ago, but they were ignored. He accused 
administrators of setting his son up to fail. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View is scheduled to start school Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 This summer, Jimmy has had one-on-one lessons with Sallie Dashiell, a speech 
pathologist hired by the district. After 29 two-hour sessions -- some at home, 
others at the park -- and some extra-curricular trips to the beach and the 
Orange County Fair, Dashiell said she has seen slow but steady progress in the 
child. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we started, he wasn't looking at me, he wasn't getting close to me. Now 
when he sees me he hugs me, he smiles at me," Dashiell said Friday. "Getting to 
know Jimmy this summer and how he moves through the world, I think we'll be 
able to put together an (inclusion) program." 
</P>
<P>
 Dashiell, who plans to work with Jimmy regularly during the school year, said 
she would prefer if he attended Circle View. But she said she would help design 
a program for him at either school. 
</P>
<P>
 Among Peters' special requests for Jimmy's classroom are: an electronic 
learning device that matches sounds with pictures, an aquarium, guinea pigs 
and/or Jimmy's pet rabbit, extra colorful educational toys and an eating 
station. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it works right, it's going to be the greatest classroom in the world," 
Peters said. "It'll have all the gidgets and gadgets -- and all the students 
will benefit." 
</P>
<P>
 District officials have approved these items, though none are yet in place in 
the Circle View classroom. But they balked Friday when Peters asked to move the 
class from a room where Jimmy has bad memories, and to switch the enrollment 
plan to an "all-volunteer" group of children and parents who support full 
inclusion. 
</P>
<P>
 "Does any other parent have the right to say, 'I want this class to move to 
the sunny side or the shady side?' No," Tarwater said. "If he has anxieties 
about the room, the specialists will work with him to get over those anxieties. 
We have children being dropped off who have school-phobia. We're not going to 
move the school." 
</P>
<P>
 Tarwater said Friday that if Peters chooses to enroll Jimmy at Golden View, 
the child might be bused to another school district campus because Golden 
View's first-grade classrooms are currently oversubscribed. He added that he 
cannot hire Jimmy's baby-sitter because there are about 40 applications ahead 
of hers. 
</P>
<P>
 Further frustrating cooperation between Peters and the district was a botched 
effort this week to bring a private, out-of-town behavior specialist here to 
design an assessment plan for Jimmy. 
</P>
<P>
 The district spent $1,200 to bring Dr. Ted Schoenberger to Huntington Beach 
from Northern California Thursday, but Schoenberger quit before even meeting 
Jimmy after speaking with Peters' attorney, Tarwater said. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials said Peters failed to arrange a meeting with Schoenberger, 
and Peters accused district staff of meeting with the specialist behind his 
back. 
</P>
<P>
 Although he is confident that Jimmy can succeed in the K-1 class planned for 
him at Circle View, Tarwater said Friday that he will not hesitate to suspend 
Jimmy if he acts out, and that returning to court this fall is "a strong 
possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 Meanwhile, Circle View Principal Dan Moss, and Jimmy's proposed teacher, Donna 
Shockley, both promised Peters Friday they would try to accommodate his needs. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'll do anything you want," Shockley told Peters. "If you want me to have 
guinea pigs in here, I'll have guinea pigs." 
</P>
<P>
 Moss later told Peters: "Jim, I will do anything to help your son."

Q & A WITH JOHN SHAW; RAMS' BOTTOM LINE IS THE BOTTOM LINE; NFL: CLUB PRESIDENT 
OFFERS LITTLE HOPE TEAM WILL STAY. HE INSISTS THERE'S NO FRONT-RUNNER CITY -- 
YET. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 One year from today -- Sept. 3, 1995 -- the National Football League will open 
the regular season, and the Rams will be playing in. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 The answer is forthcoming, Rams President John Shaw says, and by month's end 
he will have met again with Peter Angelos, the Baltimore Orioles' majority 
owner who is acting on behalf of that city's efforts to lure a team. Hartford 
has submitted a serious proposal, St. Louis continues to be interested, and 
Anaheim has not surrendered. 
</P>
<P>
 In the past few months, Baltimore emerged as the so-called favorite, only to 
be replaced by St. Louis as the rumored final choice. Almost everyone has an 
opinion on where the Rams will be in 1995, but Shaw -- the man who advises 
owner Georgia Frontiere -- remains noncommittal. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I believe the Rams are going to move?" Shaw said. "It's absolutely not a 
foregone conclusion, but it's a distinct possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 A financial analyst has been hired to tour the interested cities and verify 
promises and projections that have been submitted. The paperwork is piling up, 
the clock is running, and Frontiere is waiting on Shaw to make his 
recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 The makings for a deal are all but in place with Angelos, and it could be 
completed quickly. But Shaw said the team will wait to further explore other 
cities' offers while also listening to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lengthy question-and-answer session with The Times recently, Shaw 
explained why this has become such tedious task and detailed the various 
options available -- including the sale of a minority interest in the team -- 
and different disadvantages presented by each bidder. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you have a deal or an agreement in place presently to move the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "We are not close to any deal." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Isn't it true, though, you only have eyes for Baltimore? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "I would say we're in a holding pattern with Baltimore because we haven't 
developed all the information on the other cities to the point we have with 
Baltimore." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. But is Baltimore your No. 1 choice? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "Baltimore stands willing to do a deal, and I feel if we wanted to proceed 
in that case we could proceed rapidly. We have opted not to at this point. We 
want to develop the other situations and make sure we have the best deal 
available before making a final decision." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What other cities remain real possibilities? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "Hartford, St. Louis and Anaheim. Hartford has made a very serious 
proposal. It's a state of Connecticut deal, and Gov. (Lowell P.) Weicker is 
very energetic and enthusiastic." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. But still, isn't Baltimore the front-runner? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "There is no front-runner. All are very attractive cities that have talked 
about very attractive proposals. Each situation has tremendous advantages and 
certain disadvantages. None of the packages are such that we want to move 
there. Each one of them requires a great deal more work. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have had extensive market analysis done in several of these cities and 
there is no doubt the Baltimore-Washington, marketplace is a very strong 
football marketplace. But there was also a study done for the league in 
1979-1980 that said Anaheim was the No. 1 expansion marketplace. Studies are 
studies, and there's still a lot of guesswork on which marketplace is best." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What are the disadvantages to moving to Baltimore? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "Whether the Redskins are going to be in Laurel, Md., or not. What interim 
site would we use -- Camden Yards or Memorial Stadium -- and then how would the 
Canadian Football League lease impact that. Would we sell a minority interest. 
And that seems to be a larger element in this transaction. We would need all 
the assurances again that the bonding is in place and a new stadium can be 
built once this governor's term expires." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Let's go down the list: The disadvantages in Hartford? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Interim site. They are contemplating the Yale Bowl. How do we evaluate the 
marketplace and the impact of two neighboring NFL teams, the Patriots and 
Giants. Can a new stadium be built and how long will it take. There are a whole 
bunch of issues in Hartford. We're looking at a state of Connecticut team, and 
so the marketplace is not so clearly defined. There's substantial homework to 
be done in Hartford. That situation presents a whole different approach." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. St. Louis? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "The stadium lease is a big issue, a major issue. There is an indication 
they have been trying to deal with that, but we are no longer involved in 
discussions with St. Louis. If that lease is resolved, then I would say that 
becomes a viable situation. It has the advantage of having a stadium under 
construction." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Most people believe you have no interest in remaining in Anaheim, or 
listening to Anaheim's efforts to keep the team. 
</P>
<P>
 A. "Absolutely not true." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What about Anaheim? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "Anaheim is a little bit different because it never had the advantage or 
the head start these other cities have had. And Anaheim has been taking a lot 
of time to catch up. Obviously the issues in Anaheim are: Can they build a new 
stadium. Whether a renovated stadium suits our needs. Can the issues with the 
Angels -- two tenants in the same stadium -- be resolved. What can we do 
besides putting a better product on the field to create fan enthusiasm for the 
Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Does Anaheim really have any chance of competing with Baltimore, St. Louis 
or Hartford? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "Each one of the three other cities would economically be substantially 
better. The first year we would realize a substantial profit; we are projecting 
a $6-million loss this year here. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've said we're trying to maximize our revenue, and so it's very difficult to 
compete with new stadiums that are being funded with public money. I always 
imagined that Anaheim would have a hard time being able to put itself in the 
position to compete with these other cities. But I'm totally open to any 
proposal that Anaheim might make. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were extremely cautious to say when we gave notice that we were 
terminating our lease that this did not mean the club was necessarily moving. I 
think the fact we gave 15-month notice was misinterpreted as something greater 
than an expression of intent. I think people viewed it as a fait accompli once 
we gave notice, but I don't believe that's the case." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Has any other city in Southern California emerged as an alternative site to 
Anaheim? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "The main thrust of the Southern California effort is coming from Anaheim." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. If the Rams move, they will have to pay off the remaining $30-million bond 
for Anaheim Stadium improvements. Will that be a problem in working out a deal 
elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "There's no thought to the paying of that money in a lump sum. It can be 
paid out over time, so it's not really a big issue. It's just one item on a 
long list of wishes." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Have you personally visited any of the cities you are presently 
considering? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "No, and I presently have no plans to do so." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. How soon before this is all settled? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "I would say there's a possibility it could be announced before the 
season's done, but as we speak I can tell you no announcement is imminent." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you look at the mid-February date required by NFL rules to give notice 
in order to play elsewhere in 1995 as the ultimate deadline? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "It's a deadline of sorts, but there is always the possibility of calling a 
special meeting if we did something later." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Will the sale of a minority share in the team be part of any deal? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "Baltimore is interested in minority ownership. Anaheim basically told us 
that if it was a necessary element of the deal they would try to accommodate 
us. It doesn't necessarily have to be an element of the deal. Hartford is more 
like the Anaheim situation. If it had to be an element of the deal they have an 
individual or number of individuals who would step up and be involved. It's not 
really a contemplated element of the deal. Jerry Clinton and Stan Kroenke are 
interested in minority ownership in St. Louis, but those negotiations are 
separate with the city. If there was a sale of the ownership piece that would 
be done later." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What's the next step? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "We know where we are at in Baltimore. . . . " 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Speaking of Baltimore, aren't you concerned that Washington Redskins' owner 
Jack Kent Cooke will attempt to block a move to Baltimore? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "I haven't focused so much on what is in his best interests. I'm much more 
focused on what's in Georgia (Frontiere's) best interests. We've discussed what 
impact a team in Laurel might have on a team in Baltimore. That's obviously a 
factor on a potential move to Baltimore -- a substantial factor to be honest 
with you. It's obviously something we're trying to evaluate. It has much more 
to do with the ability of those two marketplaces to support two NFL teams than 
it has to do with the desires or wishes of the other owner." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Just what are you looking for? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "We're looking for a new state-of-the-art football-only stadium that 
maximizes revenue to the football tenant." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. So that would leave Anaheim out? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "A new football-only stadium is possible in the other three cities we have 
talked about. Anaheim is still operating under the significant disadvantage of 
not having public funds available to them. Anaheim is still proposing a 
renovated Anaheim Stadium. It's still unclear as to what the Angels would do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Why is this process taking so long? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "There are a lot of elements in the various leases for new stadiums, leases 
for interim sites -- and there are the legalities of league approval that 
haven't been sorted out in each situation. We're reviewing the possibilities of 
litigation in the event we do not get league approval. We're not simply moving 
to a stadium. There are a number of problems related to such a move." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. There was a report earlier that NFL Commissioner Paul Tagliabue tried to 
pressure you into moving to St. Louis. 
</P>
<P>
 A. "Not true, not in the least. His position from Day 1 has been the league 
has a rule (filing for permission to move), and as long as we abide by the 
rule, there will be no problems. He has expressed no opinion on which city we 
should or shouldn't move to. He's much more concerned about the league rule 
being followed." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Are you concerned, though, that the Rams might face a lawsuit if the team 
tries to move to Baltimore? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "I would be optimistic that the ownership of the National Football League 
would approve any move that would help a partner, who is in a hard situation, 
in a situation where he's having a hard time competing." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Just how bad are things in Anaheim in your estimation? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "There was a drop in attendance following our announcement that we were 
terminating our lease. But I would tell you that our ticket sales have 
decreased continually since the championship '89 season and decreased even 
before the announcement by roughly 40%" 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you believe the problem is that Southern California cannot support two 
NFL teams? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "I'm not making any such statement. I simply have been given the 
responsibility to maximize our club's revenue so that we can compete for 
players on the same basis as the other 29 clubs in the National Football 
League. I feel we can't compete next year with the two expansion franchises, 
which will have substantially more revenue than we have. We need to improve our 
financial situation in order to compete." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Attendance has dropped, but hasn't the product the Rams have put on the 
field the past few years been less than inspiring? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "I would tell people, to the extent the front office is involved with the 
product on the field, we're trying desperately to improve it. We're spending 
the same dollars as every other club trying to improve it, and if we haven't 
succeeded in doing that, we will continue to try. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm genuinely excited about this season, and first and foremost I want the 
team to succeed. I'm always optimistic that our product is going to be better, 
but I must say I'm a little bit cautious at this time. This is an important 
game for us Sunday; I don't think anyone roots harder for us than I do, and I'm 
genuinely depressed when we don't do well. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the move goes, it's an extremely difficult decision to move a 
franchise. There is a lot of pressure on Georgia, and there will be a lot of 
pressure on her to make the decision. It's become increasingly difficult to 
compete for players when you're in the position of losing money. This is 
business, too, and nobody likes to be in business and lose money." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Does the death of Tampa owner Hugh Culverhouse and the prospect now of the 
Bucs moving have an impact on what the Rams are going to do? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "It's unclear at this time how that situation might impact us. We have to 
do what is best for us and move forward." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. In regards to money, there is talk around the league that you have the 
incentive to make this move happen because you will make big money as a result 
of it. Do you have such an agreement? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "Absolutely no truth to it. I have no financial incentive; there is nothing 
in writing with ownership about me receiving money in the event we move." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Q. Do you understand the fans' reaction? Their frustration? Their feeling of 
helplessness? In some cases, their dislike for you? 
</P>
<P>
 A. "It's my job to do the best thing for ownership, the best thing for the 
football team and make it competitive. I'm hopeful that our team would be 
competitive so our fans could really get into our team. I don't want to 
minimize the significance of the ultimate question of where the Rams will be, 
but I just think it's something that will work itself out in time. It's an 
important decision and I'm not going to make it hastily."

MOUNTED POLICE TO PATROL VALLEY 'GHOST TOWN' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TRACEY KAPLAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Acknowledging that traditional crime-fighting methods have failed to protect a 
San Fernando Valley "ghost town" -- a cluster of apartment buildings left 
uninhabitable by quake damage -- city officials announced Friday that they will 
deploy police on horseback at the site and replace some unarmed private guards 
with those who carry guns. 
</P>
<P>
 The stepped-up security measures at the North Hills ghost town just east of 
the San Diego Freeway could go into effect as early as this weekend, just a 
week after neighbors complained that unarmed guards hired by the city are 
useless because they can't stand up to possibly dangerous drug dealers, gang 
members and other interlopers. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had no idea they would move this quickly, we're just tickled to death," 
said Harry Coleman, chairman of the North Hills Task Force, a citizens group. 
"For the first time since the quake, I'm optimistic that teamwork is really 
working." 
</P>
<P>
 Under the plan proposed by Los Angeles City Councilman Richard Alarcon, 10 
private guards will be assigned to patrol the ghost town, four more than 
previously. Two of the guards will be armed and will patrol the area in a car. 
</P>
<P>
 Mounted police officers will begin patrolling the area as soon as officials 
can relieve them of other duties, said Cmdr. Scott LaChasse of the Los Angeles 
Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
 "With mounted officers, you've got the visibility factor you need," LaChasse 
said. "Not only are they more visible to the public, the officers themselves 
can see more" because the officers have a high vantage point. 
</P>
<P>
 The private guards are being bolstered by guards with guns as "a protective 
thing for them," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ever since the Northridge quake created at least 13 clusters of uninhabited 
apartment buildings in the Valley, Hollywood and the mid-city area, some 
neighbors have complained about problems ranging from squatters barbecuing 
inside abandoned units to prostitutes and drug dealers setting up shop in the 
parking lots. 
</P>
<P>
 But the extra security measures announced Friday are necessary only at the 
North Hills site, largely because of pre-existing crime problems there, police 
said. In an effort to reduce drive-by drug trafficking in the same general 
area, police barricaded some streets east of the freeway between Roscoe 
Boulevard and Nordhoff Street several years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 The city is paying for the guards by tapping a $4-million federal disaster 
relief fund it received to board up, fence off and protect the ghost towns. The 
armed guards will cost about $18 an hour, only $3 more an hour than unarmed 
guards, said Pat Bonino, supervisor of disaster recovery for the City 
Administrative Office. 
</P>
<P>
 Initially, the city had not hired armed guards because local police officials 
feared that could lead to violent confrontations and subsequent lawsuits 
against the city. But in response to Alarcon's request that the LAPD take a 
second look at the issue, LaChasse testified Friday before an emergency meeting 
of the city's Ad Hoc Committee on Earthquake Recovery that some armed guards 
would be acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
 "It has to be based on specific facts, on a rationale that they're needed," 
LaChasse said. 
</P>
<P>
 City officials cited two incidents -- one of which occurred in the North Hills 
ghost town -- that they said proved extra security measures were needed at that 
site. 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday, an unarmed guard reported that a man in the ghost town fired a gun 
at a passing car, they said. Earlier this year, a police officer was attacked 
near a quake-damaged house west of the freeway by a vandal wielding a shock 
absorber, said Sgt. Jack Ahrens of the LAPD's Devonshire station. 
</P>
<P>
 The city has hired armed guards before to protect employees in high-crime 
areas, including the Downtown offices of the Community Redevelopment Agency, 
said Barbara Zeidman, assistant general manager of the city's housing 
department, which administers the security program. "It's not unprecedented," 
she said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council's earthquake recovery committee will review the new security 
program in 30 days to determine whether it is working, officials said. LOS

 BRANDO TALKS: The book everyone in Hollywood has been waiting for -- Marlon 
Brando's autobiography -- will finally hit the shelves next week. Word is he's 
pretty blunt. . . . Brando is a familiar figure in the Valley, especially at 
Solley's in Sherman Oaks. "In one week, I may see him two or three times," says 
owner Sol Zide, "and then I might not see him for four months." 
</P>
<P>
 MAD ABOUT METER: Toni Slee of Woodland Hills was mad as, well, you know what, 
and wasn't going to take it any more. The source of her ire: a cranky meter at 
the top of the Winnetka on-ramp to the southbound 101 (B2). . . . She filed 
complaints and says, "I wish Arnold Schwarzenegger could detonate all of these 
meters." 
</P>
<P>
 HOLIDAY RUSH: Believe it or not, Rosh Hashanah is here already. It's time for 
a new outfit, gefilte fish, synagogue tickets -- the works. The Jewish new year 
begins Monday night, the earliest in 18 years. Many Jews aren't prepared, but 
Valley temples still expect big crowds for services, which will include a 
reading of the Torah (above). . . . But don't worry. The holidays won't fall 
this early again until 2013 (B1). 
</P>
<P>
 PROBE: A Sun Valley company is under scrutiny. A source says Interactive 
America Corp., which was the second-largest bidder in July's FCC auction for 
interactive television licenses, has become the subject of a criminal 
investigation, along with another firm (D1). . . . The firm qualified for 
discounts on its bid because, it said, it is a small business owned by a woman. 
</P>
<P>
 TOUGH GOAL: CSUN's soccer team hopes to get off on the right foot tonight when 
it opens the new season against Cal Sate Dominguez Hills at North Campus 
Stadium. But the Matadors will have to do battle without All-American Armando 
Valdivia, who used up his eligibility (C15). . . . Players who must fill the 
scoring void include Matthew Davis, Keith West, Keith Rosenberg and Nelson 
Townes. Michael Arkush

ALASKA TRIBAL ELDERS QUESTION TEEN-AGE ROBBERS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By from Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Tribal elders considering possible banishment for two Tlingit teen-agers 
convicted of robbing and beating a pizza deliveryman focused Friday on a man 
who the youths say suggested the robbery. 
</P>
<P>
 The 12 elders also questioned the boys at length about the pizza, including 
its size, who ate it and the toppings. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of the questions elicited smirks from the defendants, Adrian Guthrie and 
Simon Roberts. 
</P>
<P>
 The 17-year-old cousins, both formerly of Klawock, pleaded guilty in May to 
robbing and beating Tim Whittlesey of Everett, Wash., permanently damaging his 
hearing and eyesight. 
</P>
<P>
 Last month, a Washington state judge postponed sentencing the pair to see if 
Tlingit justice would work better than prison. 
</P>
<P>
 The two-day hearing marks the first time a state court has referred a criminal 
case to a Native American tribal panel for punishment -- in this case, 
banishment to separate, isolated islands in Alaska's vast Alexander 
Archipelago. 
</P>
<P>
 The elders said they hoped to conclude the hearing Friday and deliberate in 
private before announcing their ruling. 
</P>
<P>
 The youths told the elders they had gotten drunk on rum at a party the night 
of the attack last year. 
</P>
<P>
 When one of the judges, Rudy James, expressed disbelief that the crime was 
done without planning, Guthrie said: "We didn't sit down and draw a map. . . . 
I mean, it doesn't take a lot of skill to rob a pizza man." 
</P>
<P>
 On Thursday, Guthrie said they got the idea from another boy who bragged that 
he had mugged pizza deliverymen "to make quick cash." 
</P>
<P>
 But on Friday, Guthrie described the other person as a 25-year-old white man 
who lived in the Everett apartment building where the party was held. 
</P>
<P>
 The elders asked numerous questions about the man, and one of them suggested 
he should be standing with the teen-agers as an accomplice. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason he didn't get arrested is he wrote statements against us 
saying what we did," Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
 The judges also asked detailed questions about the pizza. 
</P>
<P>
 When one judge inquired about the toppings, Guthrie snapped: "I don't see what 
relevancy that has." He also smirked and showed exasperation at other 
questions. 
</P>
<P>
 A tribal advocate for the defendants asked the elders to explain the purpose 
of the questions, drawing a stinging rebuke from elder Byron Skinna Sr. 
</P>
<P>
 "You broke tribal law. Worse than that, you brought shame on your families. 
That's the worst thing," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 George Dalton Sr., another elder, told the boys not to smirk. 
</P>
<P>
 "You don't joke about things like this. This joking manner has brought you to 
this position," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 When Simon replied: "Alcohol has brought us to this position," Dalton said: "I 
didn't ask you to answer." 
</P>
<P>
 Whittlesey, 25, is attending the hearing with his wife, father and uncle.

MAN BEHIND WYNN KIDNAPING SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By Associated Press 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The mastermind in the Kevin Wynn kidnaping was sentenced to 24 years, 7 months 
in prison by a judge who accused him of terrorizing one of the city's most 
high-profile families with "greed-driven" actions. 
</P>
<P>
 Ray Cuddy showed no emotion and declined to comment before U.S. District Judge 
Lloyd George imposed the maximum sentence of 295 months and ordered him to pay 
restitution of $662,000. 
</P>
<P>
 The sentencing marked the final chapter in an incident that began July 26, 
1993, when Wynn was kidnaped from her home and held for more than two hours 
until her father, casino mogul Stephen A. Wynn, paid a $1.45-million ransom. 
She was released unharmed in a parking lot at McCarran International Airport. 
</P>
<P>
 Wynn declined comment as he left the courtroom with his arm around his 
27-year-old daughter. The victim's mother, Elaine, fought back tears and 
responded, "Not quite yet," when asked for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 The judge said he imposed the maximum penalty because of an incident in which 
Kevin Wynn was forced at gunpoint to strip to her underwear, then forced to 
pose with another kidnaper, Jacob Sherwood. 
</P>
<P>
 Cuddy took photos of the two and threatened to give them to the media if she 
told authorities of the kidnaping.

LOCAL BANK LED U.S. IN STUDENT DEFAULT RATE; LENDING: VENTURA COUNTY NATIONAL 
BANK HAD THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF BAD EDUCATION LOANS IN 1992. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JULIE FIELDS, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A new federal report shows that Ventura County National Bank led the nation in 
percentage of student loan defaults in 1992, the latest year such figures are 
available. 
</P>
<P>
 The U.S. Department of Education report says that 3,616 of the Oxnard-based 
bank's student borrowers -- or 47% -- had missed payments for at least 180 days 
that year. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Cupp, the bank's president, said Friday that he does not know why his 
bank led the nation in bad student loans, but that it has since discontinued 
making student loans because they are more trouble than they are worth. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, the bank sold off its entire portfolio of student loans in 1992, he 
said. He noted, however, that the loans did not lose the bank money, because 
repayment is guaranteed by the federal government. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank president dismissed the new report as irrelevant. 
</P>
<P>
 "To me, it's a non-event," Cupp said. "It was a disappointment to see it 
because we're just no longer active in it." 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's 47.3% default rate was by far the highest of the nation's 100 
financial institutions that issue the most student loans, the report said. And 
the bank ranked third nationally the previous year, with a 45% default rate.

<P>
 For 1992, the Bank of New England in Charlestown, Mass., posted the second 
highest default rate at 37.9%, while the First National Bank of Commerce in New 
Orleans was third with a rate of 36.7%. 
</P>
<P>
 No other Ventura County banks were listed among the nation's top 100 lenders 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Peter Banks, chief financial officer of Ventura County National, said he 
thinks that most of the bank's bad loans were to students at colleges in 
California, but he did not know which schools the borrowers attended. 
</P>
<P>
 Among the county's three community colleges, Oxnard College had the highest 
default rate, 25.7% in 1992, down from 40% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Ventura College posted a 19.6% default rate for 1992, while Moorpark College 
listed a rate of 12.6% -- both figures that fell below the state average of 
about 20%. Cal Lutheran University showed a 4.7% default rate. 
</P>
<P>
 The decline of Oxnard College's default rate mirrors a trend. The nationwide 
number of bad student loans was 15% in 1992, down from a high of 22.4% in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
 Education officials said they think the improvement stems from tougher loan 
rules that allow the government to garnish the wages and income-tax refunds of 
delinquent borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
 Cupp said he could not explain his bank's high default rate because the bank 
sold its loans to other investors two years ago along with records of those 
accounts. 
</P>
<P>
 The bank's student loan department, which had been headquartered at the 
Camarillo branch, was then shut down. 
</P>
<P>
 According to Banks, the decision to stop handling student loans was not 
related to default rates. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was an economic decision," he said. "Costs were becoming higher than what 
made sense to continue." 
</P>
<P>
 Stephanie Babyak, spokeswoman for the U.S. Department of Education, said high 
default rates may not reflect bad loan policies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The bank may simply be loaning to schools that have high default rates," she 
said. "It doesn't mean the bank necessarily has some questionable practices." 
</P>
<P>
 Default rates were based on the number of borrowers who were scheduled to 
begin making payments in 1992 but went at least 180 days without a payment that 
year or the following year.

CAMPGROUNDS PACKED FOR THE HOLIDAY; LABOR DAY: FEW SPACES ARE LEFT BY FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON. MEANWHILE, THE CHP BEEFS UP ITS PATROLS FOR THE LONG WEEKEND.

 Ventura County campgrounds were nearly full and highway patrolmen were bracing 
Friday for the annual Labor Day exodus, historically the year's deadliest 
three-day holiday. 
</P>
<P>
 From Lake Piru to the beaches of Ventura and Oxnard, end-of-summer vacationers 
staked out their grassy picnic spot or stretch of sand as forecasters predicted 
foggy mornings and sunny afternoons for the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 The California Highway Patrol, meanwhile, planned to nearly double its number 
of officers in the field and urged motorists to prepare for delays along the 
Ventura Freeway, which each Labor Day is snarled with traffic from Rincon Point 
to Oxnard. 
</P>
<P>
 While promising to be on the watch for drunk drivers, neither the CHP nor the 
Ventura Police Department planned to set up sobriety checkpoints because of 
budget constraints, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 But the Oxnard Police Department planned to set one up Friday night on a 
section of the Pacific Coast Highway between Oxnard and the Los Angeles County 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 This 21-mile segment, considered one of the most dangerous roads statewide, 
has been designated as the Pacific Coast Highway Safety Corridor, where 
authorities plan to install curve warning signs and emergency call boxes, among 
other safety measures. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've lost count of the number of fatalities I've seen here," said Simon 
Cavazos, a state parks ranger who has responded to as many as 20 fatal 
accidents since he began working at Point Mugu State Park about 15 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 CHP Capt. Mike Porrazzo, the area commander for Ventura County, said two 
people were killed in Ventura County last year during the Labor Day weekend, 
and one of the deaths occurred on the Pacific Coast Highway. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's one of the worst things about this time of the year -- things like 
that," Cavazos said. 
</P>
<P>
 Aside from Pacific Coast Highway, Porrazzo said the primary traffic problems 
occur at two choke points in Ventura, where the southbound Ventura Freeway 
drops from three to two lanes, and another area near Rincon Point. 
</P>
<P>
 "Once you slow (the traffic) down, you just don't catch up, especially on a 
holiday like this," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the highways, campgrounds at the beaches and the mountains were either 
full or close to it by Friday afternoon, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 David Swaffar, a park official at Emma Wood State Beach, said he turned away 
as many as 100 would-be campers Friday because the area's 61 spaces had been 
filled since Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
 "It just seems like a lot of people didn't bother to check with us before they 
left on their trips," Swaffar said. He added that the moment a spot becomes 
available, another camper swoops in, typically within minutes. 
</P>
<P>
 McGrath State Beach was also filled to capacity, said state Lifeguard Casey 
Culp, as were Faria and Hobson county parks up the coast. 
</P>
<P>
 Inland, Ranger Tim Lawson at Lake Casitas said just five of the 460 camping 
spots remained vacant by midday Friday -- and "they should be taken up any 
minute now." 
</P>
<P>
 But at Lake Casitas' alternate camping area, a large, grassy field without 
barbecue pits or picnic tables, about half of the 200 parking spaces were 
available, Lawson added. 
</P>
<P>
 At Lake Piru, park manager Doug West said all 238 campgrounds were full, but 
only about 50 of the 200 spaces in the adjacent field were taken up by Friday 
afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 Due to a low-pressure system near Yuma, Ariz., fog and low clouds should move 
inland each night this weekend and are not expected to burn off until late 
morning, said Vladimir Ryshko of the National Weather Service. The highs should 
be in the 70s today and Sunday and could reach the 80s on Labor Day, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Culp, the lifeguard at McGrath State Beach, said he had heard from 
counterparts in Huntington Beach that six-foot waves were hitting the southern 
shores, and similar waves, though probably a bit smaller, might make their way 
to Ventura County beaches by late tonight. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday's weather, he added, began with fog, giving way to sunny skies about 11 
a.m., followed by cooling winds in mid-afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
 "It makes for a pretty short day at the beach, doesn't it?" he said. 
"Especially if you've driven a long way to get here." Holiday Weekend Monday 
marks the celebration of Labor Day, set aside to recognize labor's contribution 
to the nation.Closed: All government offices, courts, banks, post offices, 
stock and commodity exchange, libraries and many businesses. Metrolink train 
service will not be offered.

2 WOMEN ATTACKED BY MAN IN OJAI AREA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JASON GRANT, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Two women living four miles apart in the normally quiet Ojai area were raped 
or sexually assaulted Friday morning, apparently by the same man, authorities 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators are searching for a man they think sexually assaulted a 
64-year-old Ojai woman about 6 a.m. Friday and then raped a 54-year-old woman 
in her home just east of Ojai about 10:30 a.m. 
</P>
<P>
 By contrast, there were no rapes in Ojai in 1993, crime statistics show. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think that's a reasonable assumption, that it is the same person," Sgt. 
Mark Novak said. "I had heard . . . that in both instances the suspect smelled 
of cigarette smoke and that led detectives to guess he possibly may be a heavy 
smoker." 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Department descriptions of the suspect in both attacks were almost 
identical. 
</P>
<P>
 In the sexual assaults, one at Taormina Lane in Ojai and one at El Jina Lane 
just east of the city, the suspect was described as a 5-foot-7, 150-pound white 
man between the ages of 25 and 30 with short reddish-blond hair. He wore a 
green T-shirt, tennis shoes and a stocking mask and walked with a slight limp. 
</P>
<P>
 In the rape on El Jina Lane, the description added one detail -- that the man 
had a closely cropped beard. 
</P>
<P>
 Novak said details about the attacks were still sketchy late Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 In the earlier crime, the woman, who lives alone, was assaulted but not raped, 
Novak said. "How he got into the house, at this point, nobody knows," Novak 
added. 
</P>
<P>
 A sheriff's statement said that the suspect stayed in the woman's home for 
about 45 minutes, until she jumped through her bedroom window and screamed for 
help. The man fled. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman received minor injuries during her escape and was treated by Ventura 
County Fire Department employees. 
</P>
<P>
 A neighbor who heard the woman's cry called the Sheriff's Department. The man 
was seen running west from the victim's home, which is in a community where 
mostly senior citizens live. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman who was raped was also alone, in her east Ojai Valley home, Novak 
said. She was treated at Ventura Medical Center and released, Novak said. 
</P>
<P>
 "The victim did not sustain serious (physical) injuries," Novak said. "She was 
taken there to be treated for the rape." The suspect again was seen running 
from the woman's home. 
</P>
<P>
 Councilwoman Nina Shelley, herself a retired senior citizen, said such crimes 
are rare for Ojai. "This is intolerable, and it must not happen again if we can 
possibly prevent it."

CHARGES BEING CUT TO SAVE JOB; CRIME: EX-SHERIFF'S SUPERVISOR ADMITS STEALING 
GUN, SELLING IT. JUDGE SAYS HE'LL REDUCE CASE FROM FELONY TO MISDEMEANOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 A former Sheriff's Department supervisor pleaded guilty Friday to stealing a 
gun from a property room he oversaw and selling it at an Oxnard pawnshop. 
</P>
<P>
 But over the prosecutor's objections, Municipal Judge Bruce Clark said he 
would reduce the felony grand theft charge against Norman A. Wade to a 
misdemeanor when the defendant is sentenced Sept. 30. 
</P>
<P>
 The reduced charge carries a lighter sentence and apparently will save Wade's 
current position as a toxicologist in Phoenix, said Deputy Dist. Atty. Robert 
Meyers. Meyers said he was disappointed by the judge's decision. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mr. Wade had a very serious position of trust as director of the crime 
laboratory," Meyers said. "He darn well knew that he was committing a felony 
when he took the (firearm), and we felt that he deserved a felony conviction 
for his actions." 
</P>
<P>
 Defense attorney Robert I. Schwartz said the judge's promise to reduce Wade's 
charge was critical in his client's decision to plead guilty. Schwartz told the 
judge that Wade's job would be terminated if he was convicted of a felony. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade, 49, joined the Ventura County Sheriff's Department crime lab in June, 
1990. He was forced to resign in June, 1992, after pleading no contest in court 
to charges that he stole a license plate registration sticker from the property 
room and falsified registration documents for his own car. 
</P>
<P>
 He was fined $300 and sentenced to two years probation in that case. 
</P>
<P>
 A subsequent audit of a gun locker in the property room found a .357-magnum 
pistol missing. Recalling Wade's court case, detectives checked pawn slips that 
shops in Ventura County register with police agencies and traced the gun to 
Wade. 
</P>
<P>
 Wade sold the firearm at Get-Mor Loan & Jewelry in Oxnard for $125 in May, 
1991, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Investigators suspected Wade in the theft of other items from the property 
room, including jewelry, cash and a camera. But the pawned gun was the only 
item for which the district attorney's office could present evidence, Meyers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Clark's decision to reduce Wade's conviction significantly lessens the maximum 
sentence he will face, Meyers said. Under state guidelines, the theft of a 
firearm could bring a sentence of up to three years in prison with a felony 
conviction, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 But with a misdemeanor, Wade faces a maximum of one year in the Ventura County 
Jail, he said. With good behavior, he could be paroled in half that time, 
Meyers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Chief Deputy Kenneth Kipp said the case has prompted the department 
to improve procedures in the property room. 
</P>
<P>
 "When you get a black eye, you try to fix it," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The 25,000 pieces of evidence that are processed through the property room 
each year are now audited regularly, Kipp said. Particular attention is given 
to cash, narcotics and weapons, he said.

LOPEZ VS. PLISKY: IT HAS A FAMILIAR RING; OXNARD: THIS TIME, THE MAYOR'S WIFE 
IS THE CANDIDATE AGAINST HUSBAND'S NEMESIS, AND NINE OTHERS, IN HARBOR DISTRICT 
BOARD RACE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez told his wife, Irma, that he had some good news and 
some bad news. 
</P>
<P>
 The first day to withdraw nomination papers for elections in Ventura County, 
July 18, had almost passed when Lopez, running for his second straight term as 
mayor, learned of an unexpected development. Irma Lopez decided to ask for the 
good news first. 
</P>
<P>
 The good news, Lopez said, was that his political nemesis -- Councilman 
Michael A. Plisky -- announced that after three failed attempts, he would not 
run a fourth time for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 The bad news, Lopez told his wife, was that Plisky planned to campaign against 
her -- for the Oxnard Harbor District's board of commissioners. 
</P>
<P>
 Irma Lopez said she was "very surprised," but undeterred by Plisky's 
announcement. She had yet to formally declare her candidacy for the board, 
which governs the deep-water Port of Hueneme, but went ahead with her 
2-year-old plan to become the first woman elected to the commission. 
</P>
<P>
 "For a couple of seconds I was very concerned (about) what people would 
think," Irma Lopez said. "But I didn't let it affect my plans. This is not an 
issue of Lopez versus Plisky. This is not a lark with me. I have had an 
interest in that port for 10 years." 
</P>
<P>
 The moderate Manuel Lopez and the conservative Plisky were at odds on the 
council for years, insiders say, especially concerning social issues. But their 
enmity grew in 1992, when they squared off for mayor. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike took the gloves off and was hitting pretty hard," said John Davies, a 
Santa Barbara-based political consultant who worked for Lopez during the 
election. "Manny has a long memory." 
</P>
<P>
 But both Plisky and Irma Lopez dismissed talk of a second Lopez-Plisky 
rivalry, noting that there are nine other candidates vying for three seats on 
the Oxnard Harbor District's five-member board. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky, who has served on the Oxnard City Council for eight years, said he 
considered running for the district for two years, and is confident he will be 
elected. 
</P>
<P>
 "I heard rumors about (Irma's candidacy) as soon as I announced," Plisky said, 
"But it makes no difference to me. I don't see this as one candidate versus 
another, I think the issues will win out." 
</P>
<P>
 The only deep-water port between Los Angeles and San Francisco, the Port of 
Hueneme pours about $200 million annually into Ventura County's economy, and 
has created about 2,000 jobs in the region. Between June, 1993, and June, 1994, 
278 vessels carrying 790,000 metric tons of cargo docked at the port's five 
commercial berths, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 Commissioners administer the district, which employs 24 workers, and are paid 
$600 a month in addition to health benefits and life insurance. They are also 
known for lavish junkets such as a 10-day trip to Sweden, Germany and England 
that cost the district more than $43,000. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's the best elected office there is," Davies said. "You don't take a lot of 
abuse, you are never in the news, there's a lot of junkets, they don't have a 
budget problem, and no one calls you about stray dogs."  
</P>
<P>
 The candidates in the Nov. 8 election are Philip R. Bronner, Raymond E. Fosse, 
Bill Hill, Steve W. Stocks, Sue Van Camp, Danny L. Greenstreet, Jess Herrera, 
Donald R. Senesac, Oras N. Racicot, Irma Lopez and Plisky. 
</P>
<P>
 Fosse, 55, a retired ship's captain who was elected to the board in 1990, is 
seeking a second term, but the two other incumbents, Stanley J. Daily and 
Edward J. Millan, were disqualified from running for reelection because of a 
county commission's 1990 decision to cut Thousand Oaks and Camarillo out of the 
district. Both are from Camarillo. 
</P>
<P>
 Currently serving four-year terms are Jess Ramirez, 48, who in 1992 was the 
first longshoreman ever elected to the district, and Ray A. Fletcher, 79, a 
retired naval lieutenant serving his sixth four-year term. 
</P>
<P>
 Plisky, 53, who is in his eighth year on the Oxnard City Council, said he 
considered retiring from public office, but chose to remain in politics. 
</P>
<P>
 "I knew it was my last term," Plisky said. "I told many people that, and 
during that time I thought about how I could serve the area. The only question 
was, do I want to go through another campaign . . . if I wanted to continue to 
be an elected official." 
</P>
<P>
 Irma Lopez, 47, was shot and seriously wounded last December by Alan 
Winterbourne during his deranged rampage at her workplace, the Oxnard 
Employment Development Department. Winterbourne killed four people before he 
was fatally shot by Oxnard police. 
</P>
<P>
 Irma Lopez, who is on leave from her job, said she did not know until recently 
if her health would prevent her from running. 
</P>
<P>
 As part of her job at the unemployment office, Lopez said she helped the 
harbor district compile studies on work force trends. She said she considers 
herself qualified to serve as commissioner. 
</P>
<P>
 She has put aside initial worries that some voters would think she was trying 
to ride her husband's coattails. 
</P>
<P>
 "My concern was that people would think I was trying to use that, but people 
who know me know of my involvement in my own right," she said. "People out 
there know that women have their own lives."  
</P>
<P>
 Manuel Lopez said that any political differences between Plisky and his wife 
will not be a problem on the district board, because the harbor's goals are 
solely business-oriented. He added that a Plisky-Lopez showdown would not make 
sense for either candidate. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're really not running against each other," Lopez said. "There are three 
open seats. I think it would be extremely foolish for one candidate to go after 
another." 
</P>
<P>
 Dorothy Maron, who served on the City Council with Lopez and Plisky, said Irma 
Lopez and Plisky have name recognition far beyond that of other harbor district 
candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a good chance that they will both win," she said. "That would be 
interesting."

 "Vigil at the Crossroads," a performance piece scheduled for 4 to 7 p.m. 
Friday in the Sycamore Hills area of Laguna Canyon Road, will protest the San 
Joaquin Hills toll road project, for which part of the canyon has been 
bulldozed by the Transportation Corridor Agency. One hundred white crosses will 
be placed alongside the road by participants dressed in black to symbolize, 
according to a press release, false assumptions that have permitted the agency 
to "metaphorically bulldoze through local and federal protective legislation." 
An open casket bearing an American flag also will be part of the piece, 
questioning "whether a democratic process can prevail in Orange County." (714)

JAZZ REVIEW ; GREMOLI MARCHES ON IN TRUE NEW ORLEANS STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 During Gremoli's performance of the New Orleans traditional jazz number "Lead 
Me Savior" at the Fullerton Hofbrau on Thursday, the beer hall-and-restaurant 
jukebox kicked in and a grunge-rock beat began blaring through the speakers. 
But the five-piece group never missed a beat as the decidedly more aggressive 
and amplified rhythm briefly overshadowed the combo's own sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The jukebox was quickly disabled, and Gremoli kept on wailing, brushing off 
that bit of intrusion as if it never existed. The bass and banjo pulsed. The 
clarinet soared. The cornet chuckled. And the trombone slid through a series of 
guffaws. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident served as a tidy image of longevity. The type of music Gremoli 
plays -- traditional New Orleans sounds in the style of the Crescent City's 
Preservation Hall Jazz Band -- has seen musical fads come and go. But it just 
keeps marching along. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience for New Orleans music may not be as big as those for grunge or 
rap, but it has stood by the genre for a period that's measured in decades 
rather than months. 
</P>
<P>
 And new interest seems to be building, as young aficionados search for the 
roots of rock 'n' roll, and clubs such as the Derby and Atlas Bar & Grill in 
Los Angeles offer retro-sounds that hark back to the '30s, the '20s and beyond. 
It seems like everyone, as in the line from "The Saints Go Marching In," now 
wants to be in that number. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's important to note that Gremoli is no Dixieland band. The group, which 
leader-clarinetist Ron Going estimates has some 200 songs in addition to the 
obvious standards, plays in the New Orleans marching-band and dance-hall 
tradition, a style heavy with improvisation and less commercial than its more 
familiar, southern counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's show (Gremoli has an indefinite Thursday run in progress at the 
Hofbrau) featured such obscure numbers as Sam Morgan's "Bogalusa Strut," Ma 
Rainey's "Jelly Bean Blues" and a George Lewis tune, "Underneath Hawaiian 
Skies," which had disappeared for some 40 years until it was rediscovered in 
1991 on an obscure, private-label 78 found in someone's attic. 
</P>
<P>
 Between sets, Going explains how the the band (Gremoli is an anagram of 
Gilmore, the surname of the group's original cornet player) is constantly 
unearthing new material in what he calls the "true folk music of New Orleans." 
</P>
<P>
 Together since 1989, the band consists of Going, cornetist Ted Thomas (who 
replaced founding member Denis Gilmore), banjo player Vic Loring, bassist Mike 
Fay and trombonist Jim Leigh. Occasionally, the ensemble is joined by drummer 
Bert Thomas, a Northern California resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Going takes a moment between numbers to spin anecdotes about the material to 
follow or explain its origins. Before leading the group into "Hiawatha Rag," he 
tells how a group of New Orleans musicians assembled in the 1940s to record the 
piece looked at the music and said, "We always called it 'Lizard on a Rail.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That tune, a mid-tempo piece with a pulse like a heartbeat, held almost 
polka-like passages that featured a clean blend of horns. Trombonist Leigh took 
a vocal turn on the ballad "Breeze" after cornetist Thomas cried his way 
through a suitably melancholy solo. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's ensemble play is in the true New Orleans style with each horn 
leading and playing off the others as a theme progresses. The tight framework 
is provided by Loring's sharp banjo beat in unison with Fay's string bass, 
which makes for a pulse as regular as a sleeper's breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Gremoli has a self-produced CD, "Hot, Tight and Ready," that gives a good 
overview of its style, and it makes appearances around the state at jazz club 
gatherings and trad-jazz festivals. In the Orange County area, the group 
frequently appears at the Capistrano Depot in San Juan Capistrano and is 
featured this weekend at the Los Angeles Classic Jazz Festival. 
</P>
<P>
 *Gremoli appears today at the Los Angeles Classic Jazz Festival. 11 a.m.-12:30 
p.m. at the Doubletree Lounge, LAX Doubletree Hotel, 5400 W. Century Blvd., Los 
Angeles; also from 10 p.m.-midnight at the Embassy Suites Hotel, 9801 Airport 
Blvd., Los Angeles. On Sunday, Gremoli again appears at the Embassy Suites

Grill, 26701 Verdugo St., San Juan Capistrano. 1 p.m. Free. (714) 496-8181.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: NEWBURY PARK ; ACTRESS PLEADS NOT GUILTY TO 
MOLESTATION 
</P>

<P>
 A 45-year-old Newbury Park pornography actress charged with sexually molesting 
a 14-year-old boy pleaded not guilty in Ventura County Superior Court on 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Laurie Arden, charged with six felony counts of child molestation, was given a 
trial date of Oct. 3. 
</P>
<P>
 Prosecutors say Arden had sex with the boy in April and May after she hired 
him to help her move out of a rented room in a house on White Oak Lane in 
Newbury Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden allegedly showed him nude images of herself on a computer screen and in 
a magazine, then suggested they have sex. 
</P>
<P>
 A Municipal Court judge ordered Arden to stand trial in the case last month 
after listening to the boy recount the sexual encounters during a preliminary 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 The defendant is charged with two counts of unlawful sexual intercourse with a 
minor, two counts of sexual conduct using a foreign object, one count of 
showing explicit photos to a minor and one count of lewd and lascivious conduct 
with a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 The boy testified that he agreed to have sex with the woman the first time 
because he was "curious and confused." 
</P>
<P>
 He said they had sex a second time after Arden threatened to report him to 
police. 
</P>
<P>
 Arden is being held in the Ventura County Jail in lieu of a $20,000 bail.

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: LIBRARIES EXTEND OPERATING HOURS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 The lines at the circulation desk might be longer, but many of Ventura 
County's libraries will remain open an extra four hours a week starting Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a year of experience behind us working at our greatly reduced budget 
level, we believed we could make modest improvements in the base-line 
schedule," Dixie D. Adeniran, director of library services, wrote in a memo to 
the Board of Supervisors."The trade-off will be slower response time from 
support departments and longer waits at public services desks." 
</P>
<P>
 Severe budget cuts in past years have forced the library system to slash its 
staff and sharply reduce its hours of operation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new schedule, the county's large libraries -- Camarillo, Simi Valley 
and E. P. Foster and H. P. Wright in Ventura -- will go from 32 to 36 hours a 
week. The medium-sized branches -- Fillmore, Moorpark, Ojai and Prueter in Port 
Hueneme -- will increase from 20 to 24. 
</P>
<P>
 Seven smaller neighborhood libraries will not be affected. PHYLLIS W. JORDAN

COUNTYWIDE FOCUS: COUNTY MAY SELL TRAINING SERVICES 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Training and child-care programs that were slashed from past Ventura County 
budgets could be offered again under a plan allowing the county's Personnel 
Department to charge public agencies and private businesses for services. 
</P>
<P>
 The Board of Supervisors agreed Tuesday to let personnel officials develop a 
training program they could offer to other county agencies, city governments 
and businesses. 
</P>
<P>
 "Basically, what we're asking is for you to allow us to operate more like a 
private business," Personnel Director Ron Komers told the board, which will 
take its final vote on the measure Sept. 13. 
</P>
<P>
 For years, officials have trained other county employees in such skills as 
time management smoking cessation. But years of budget cuts have steadily 
eroded the training budget. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the proposed program, county agencies would pay the Personnel Department 
for such training. The one-minute manager course would cost $37 per person, 
while basic supervision would cost $256 per person. City employees or private 
groups could buy training as well, for about double the price. PHYLLIS W.

EAST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SIMI VALLEY; 3 HELD AFTER OFFICER FIRES SHOT IN 
PURSUIT 
</P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Simi Valley police have arrested two Los Angeles-area men and a 15-year-old 
boy on suspicion of driving a stolen vehicle after a brief pursuit and foot 
chase during which an officer shot at one of the men. 
</P>
<P>
 No one was injured in the incident, which marked the first officer-involved 
shooting in Simi Valley since December, 1991. 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Cratch, the 23-year-old officer who fired his gun, has been placed on 
paid leave while the shooting is investigated. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, the incident began about 11:30 p.m. Thursday when Cratch 
tried to stop a white Chevrolet Suburban for driving erratically. 
</P>
<P>
 The driver of the Suburban sped up, turning north on Stearns Street, west on 
Barnard Street, then stopping east of Kadota Street. 
</P>
<P>
 During the chase, Cratch saw a metal object thrown from the vehicle and 
suspected it was a handgun. 
</P>
<P>
 Police now believe the object was actually a beer can, said Sgt. Mike King. 
</P>
<P>
 After the vehicle stopped, two men jumped out and ran into a field. Cratch 
chased the two men and fired one shot from his 9-millimeter gun as one of the 
suspects abruptly turned toward him, King said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to police, Cratch thought the suspect was armed, but no guns have 
been found in the field or on any of the suspects.  
</P>
<P>
 Officers arriving for backup captured 23-year-old Paul Morre of Panorama City 
a quarter of a mile from the scene of the shooting. The other man who fled the 
car has not been found. 
</P>
<P>
 Also arrested on suspicion of auto theft were Gevorg Gouyoumjian, 22, of 
Arleta and a 15-year-old boy from Canoga Park. Both Gouyoumjian and the boy 
remained in the stolen vehicle after the pursuit.  
</P>
<P>
 The Suburban was reported stolen from Los Angeles on Sunday. JULIE FIELDS

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: OXNARD; NEIGHBORHOOD PANEL CHAIRMAN RESIGNS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIGUEL BUSTILLO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The chairman of a neighborhood council in southwest Oxnard resigned in protest 
Friday, charging that the city is abandoning its older neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
 Jim Carlyle, head of the Redwood Neighborhood Council, said that Oxnard's 
leaders pay attention only to the newer, wealthier areas in the city. 
</P>
<P>
 "They are dumping all the welfare people in the older neighborhoods," said 
Carlyle, who has been chairman of the group for about a year. "People are 
living in garages here and (the city) does not enforce codes. . . . There's 
overcrowding. There's nothing for kids to do. What else are they going to do 
but graffiti and gangs? The city doesn't care." 
</P>
<P>
 The Redwood neighborhood is bordered by Channel Islands Boulevard, J Street, 
Bard Road and Ventura Road. 
</P>
<P>
 Eleanor Branthoover, the chairwoman of the Inter-neighborhood Council 
Committee, said she was surprised by Carlyle's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm sorry Jim is quitting, because he really has accomplished a lot, whether 
he thinks so or not," Branthoover said. "I've been doing this for 14 years, and 
it took me a while to get the city's attention." 
</P>
<P>
 Oxnard Mayor Manuel Lopez agreed. "I'm really sorry to hear that. He came to 
the council recently and said he wasn't being listened to. He was one of the 
more outstanding neighborhood leaders." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlyle, who organized a Neighborhood Watch patrol in his area, said Oxnard 
takes the patrols for granted. 
</P>
<P>
 "They just do not help us," Carlyle said. "The city makes a big deal about its 
Neighborhood Watch at election time, but the city wants nothing to do with it 
because they are afraid we'll sue them if we get hurt. We use our own vehicles, 
we risk our lives, and they take credit for it." 
</P>
<P>
 Carlyle also accused the city of allowing blight in certain neighborhoods to 
persuade people to support redevelopment. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only reason they want to let these neighborhoods go down is so they can 
redevelop the area. They're turning us into slums." MIGUEL BUSTILLO

WEST VENTURA COUNTY FOCUS: SATICOY; HEAD OF CONCRETE FIRM IS SENTENCED 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By GREG RIPPEE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The president of a Saticoy concrete company was sentenced to probation Friday 
in Ventura County Superior Court for receiving two pieces of stolen heavy 
equipment worth about $50,000. 
</P>
<P>
 Robert Anton Lynch, president of State Ready Mix, was sentenced to three years 
probation and fined $1,000 for having in his possession two front-end loaders, 
also known as skip loaders.Deputy Dist. Atty. Richard Simon valued them at 
about $25,000 each. 
</P>
<P>
 Lynch, 64, pleaded guilty July 22 to two counts of receiving stolen property. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the front-end loaders had been kept at Lynch's place of business, where 
a visiting salesman recognized it as a piece of equipment he had sold to 
another person, Simon said. He said the other loader had been kept at Lynch's 
home in Camarillo. Both pieces of equipment, Simon added, were reported missing 
in January, 1991, one from a Camarillo construction site and the other from a 
construction site in the Agoura area. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to probation and a fine, Judge Charles McGrath ordered Lynch to 
pay any restitution that his victims might be awarded in a civil court 
judgment, Simon said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said the judge also ruled that law enforcement officials can search Lynch's 
business at any time, without a warrant, during his probation period. GREG

EQUAL FOOTING; GIRL, 11, TACKLES OLD VIEWS ON BOYS TEAM 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARY F. POLS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Chances are good 11-year-old Maureen Ellement is the only member of the Conejo 
Cowboys football team whose toenails are painted a vivid pink. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 But as she bored full steam ahead toward the shoulder pads of teammate Allen 
Lopez, 13, during a recent practice, her polished nails were a well-kept 
secret. 
</P>
<P>
 With a whack and a clack and an extremely determined expression, she collided 
with the bigger player. He had the ball and he kept going, dragging her along. 
</P>
<P>
 She wrapped her arms around his waist and tugged until he dropped to the 
ground, or rather onto her 5-foot, 106-pound frame. She appeared unperturbed -- 
just another day at football practice in Thousand Oaks -- and as Maureen would 
say, she is just another player. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year, Maureen was also wearing the Conejo Cowboys' blue and white, only 
then they were on a cheerleading outfit. This season, she ditched the skirt and 
donned shoulder pads. 
</P>
<P>
 "Cheerleading had gotten kind of boring," Maureen said. "It just wasn't active 
enough for me." 
</P>
<P>
 The Cowboys' cheerleaders practice in the next field over, and after two years 
of watching football from a distance, Maureen decided to join the boys. 
</P>
<P>
 Her father, Denny Ellement, happens to be an assistant coach for the Conejo 
Cowboys, and her older brother Dennis, 12, is a member of the team. 
</P>
<P>
 "I told her that as long as her mother said it was OK, it was fine with me," 
her father said. "I have no qualms about her trying it. It's really up to her 
if she likes it or not." 
</P>
<P>
 So far, Maureen said she is enjoying the beginning of her first season. 
</P>
<P>
 No one teases her, and her teammates even throw the ball to her. She has 
already made her mark as the second fastest player on the team. She said she 
likes receiving and running with the ball the best. 
</P>
<P>
 The head coach, Danny Nalbandian, said his initial worries about Maureen 
keeping up with the boys are gone. 
</P>
<P>
 "She's working really hard," Nalbandian said. "Her athletic ability is super 
and her attitude is great. She's really taking this seriously. I'm excited for 
her." 
</P>
<P>
 The Conejo Cowboys are part of the Pacific Youth Football League. The season 
begins in mid-September, with 10 regular games for the Conejo Cowboys and a 
chance to advance to the playoffs. For now, there are practices every day and 
frequent scrimmages. 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen's long brown ponytail has not gone unnoticed, even though she tries to 
keep it tucked into her shirt. And the response to having a girl on an 
otherwise all-boys team has not been entirely favorable. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of the parents told their sons not to hit her hard," said Rick 
Riccobono, whose son, Santo, 12, is also on the Cowboys. "Everybody is worried 
about her getting hurt. She's a tough girl, but that is not the same as a tough 
boy." 
</P>
<P>
 "She is invading their space," he said. "Some things should be mixed, some 
things should be separate." 
</P>
<P>
 League Vice President Dick White said he has never heard complaints from 
parents about girls participating. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as the boys go, certain of the older ones, in the 12- to 13-year-old 
category, are a little unsure of how to handle it," White said. "Most were 
taught not to hit girls all through grammar school, and then all of a sudden 
they are in a situation where they are supposed to hit them." 
</P>
<P>
 White said there are about half a dozen girls playing on the league's 74 teams 
from Ojai to Santa Clarita. One of them is 8-year-old Mallory Westhoff of 
Thousand Oaks, a member of the Conejo Cowboys bantam team. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Lopez's father, also named Allen, said he thought Maureen was taking her 
fair share of hits, at least from his son. 
</P>
<P>
 "I myself told him, 'Allen, why don't you be nice to her?' " the older Lopez 
said. "And he said, 'Dad, she is a part of the team, and she doesn't get any 
special treatment.' " 
</P>
<P>
 Allen confirmed his father's words.  
</P>
<P>
 "We hit her harder, I mean, the same as everyone else," he said, with a slight 
smirk. "And she's very fast." 
</P>
<P>
 Maureen, who also plays softball, basketball and has a purple belt in karate, 
said she is not scared of being tackled. 
</P>
<P>
 "It doesn't really hurt at all," she said. "It might sting a little bit if you 
have 10 guys on you, but otherwise it's OK." 
</P>
<P>
 Does her older brother ever tackle her? 
</P>
<P>
 "If I get a chance to, I do," Dennis said.

BASEBALL: A WEEK TO LIVE; NEGOTIATIONS: IF THERE IS NO BARGAINING AGREEMENT BY 
SEPT. 9, SELIG PROPOSES THAT THE SEASON BE CANCELED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 If there is no bargaining agreement by next Friday, the remainder of the 1994 
baseball season, including the playoffs and World Series, will be canceled. 
</P>
<P>
 That fact became clear Friday when acting Commissioner Bud Selig proposed the 
termination date to Donald Fehr, executive director of the players' union, in a 
telephone conversation. 
</P>
<P>
 They are expected to make this official early next week, but the players have 
no real control over it. 
</P>
<P>
 And with no sessions scheduled for the Labor Day weekend and beyond, Colorado 
Rockie owner Jerry McMorris, who met with Fehr for four hours Wednesday night 
in an informal attempt to keep the negotiating process alive, said it would 
take a "major miracle" to save the season. 
</P>
<P>
 "This was not done to force anybody's hand," Selig said of the Sept. 9 date. 
"It was sheer pragmatism. 
</P>
<P>
 "You can't turn the last two weeks of the season into a farce. You can't have 
pitchers working three innings in the middle of a pennant race. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were a lot of factors. The players will have been out four weeks as of 
Friday and would require another week to get in shape. How meaningful would two 
more weeks of the season be? 
</P>
<P>
 "There was also the logistical question of reorganizing ticket departments and 
trying to promote a new playoff format. There is so little time for a viable 
lead-in to the playoffs. It's just a matter of common sense." 
</P>
<P>
 That and dollars, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 The owners had projected TV revenue of $140 million from the postseason, but 
amid the uncertainty of a players' strike now in its 23rd day, advertisers have 
been bailing out since early August. 
</P>
<P>
 That figure has shrunk to considerably less, and Selig is said to have been 
fielding a barrage of calls from owners angry over the refusal of the union to 
respond to their salary-cap proposal and the financial impact of the strike. 
</P>
<P>
 Selig had tentatively set Sept. 15 as the deadline, but bowed to the urging of 
other owners willing to cancel the World Series for the first time in history 
and get on with unilateral implementation of the new compensation system. 
</P>
<P>
 Of the potential loss of the World Series, Selig said he was "very concerned 
and very troubled, but I'm more concerned about not achieving a meaningful 
solution to our economic problems. It would be more painful and more enduring 
if we don't address them. As I've said before, we've put if off for too many 
tomorrows, and tomorrow is now here." 
</P>
<P>
 An agreement with the union prevents the owners from unilaterally implementing 
a new system before the end of the scheduled championship season. The union 
believes that has been the owners' goal all along. 
</P>
<P>
 "This has been their two-year timetable," said Gene Orza, the union's 
associate general counsel. "Nothing we have said or done has mattered. They've 
been determined to shove the salary cap down our throats. They're right where 
they want to be." 
</P>
<P>
 It is believed that the union would respond to unilateral implementation by 
asking the National Labor Relations Board to overturn it -- a long and 
difficult process -- and would then resume the strike next spring. The owners' 
proposal would also eliminate salary arbitration and create a new free-agency 
system, leaving a multitude of contractual problems to be resolved during the 
winter. 
</P>
<P>
 Is there any chance of a settlement by next Friday? 
</P>
<P>
 "It can be done, but not if the salary cap is still on the table," Orza said. 
"People talk about compromise, but there is no in-between in this negotiation, 
no halfway point. We either take the salary cap or we don't, and we don't." 
</P>
<P>
 Asked if there is any flexibility to Sept. 9, if it could be moved back should 
negotiations resume at a meaningful level, Selig said: "Common sense would have 
to prevail. All I can tell you is that nothing is scheduled, and we're on 
tenuous ground timewise. We're at a point of diminishing return." 
</P>
<P>
 The players have a $175-million-plus strike fund to get them through the days 
without paychecks. Distributions will start on Sept. 15. Players who have been 
contributing to the fund from their licensing revenue over the last four years 
will receive $10,000 each. Players who contributed for a shorter time will 
receive less. 
</P>
<P>
 Secretary of Labor Robert Reich lashed out at both the owners and players even 
before Selig proposed the Sept. 9 termination. He said they had taken their 
fans for granted and turned the national pastime into a symbol of "national 
greed." 
</P>
<P>
 Reich added that his department had provided mediators and done everything it 
could to assist the process but had seen no determination for meaningful 
negotiation by either owners or players. 
</P>
<P>
 "A pox on both your houses," he said.

PRO FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; JUDGE OPENS DOOR FOR HENLEY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE and T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge in Santa Ana has cleared the way for Darryl Henley to travel 
to road games with the Rams without a court escort, and the team's president 
said Friday that if certain conditions are met, the team probably will re-sign 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 Ram President John Shaw said that if Coach Chuck Knox wants Henley back, as it 
appears he does, and if the team can help Henley raise his $2-million bail 
while minimizing the club's liability for the entire amount, Henley could 
rejoin the team as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right!" Henley said Friday. "Things have been crazy. I hope nothing 
changes again. I want to play for the Rams. A number of people have gone 
overboard in helping. Maybe it's because they believe in the system." 
</P>
<P>
 U.S. District Judge Gary L. Taylor sided with Henley's attorneys, dropping the 
provision that a U.S. marshal or pretrial services agency officer accompany 
Henley on the road, so long as the $2 million was posted and Henley came up 
with an additional $200,000 cash deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who had cut Henley earlier this week, had indicated that they had no 
interest in re-signing him if an escort had to be used. Henley's attorneys said 
the escort "would cause undue disruption to the team's ability to prepare for, 
and play in, the games in question." 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge's ruling, and Shaw's statement that Henley's return to the team 
was likely, appears to have given the troubled cornerback new life as he awaits 
trial in January as a key suspect in an alleged conspiracy to distribute 
cocaine from his Brea home. If convicted, he faces a possible maximum 
punishment of life in federal prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he was still awaiting a detailed copy of the judge's ruling, but if 
the only restriction was a financial one, then the team would talk to Henley's 
representatives about the manner in which the $2-million bail could be raised. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the (financial) risk is not great, we will probably re-sign him," 
Shaw said. 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams do re-sign Henley, considered one of the team's best defensive 
players, they will have to release another player. They would like to re-sign 
Henley next week and avoid a distraction before Sunday's regular-season opener, 
but they would be better served financially to release a player before the 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 Any player on the 53-man roster as of Sunday is entitled to half of his salary 
if he is released. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams have been in a quandary about Henley since his indictment last year. 
Team officials agreed in August to sign him to a one-year, $350,000 contract 
but the terms of his bail prohibited him from leaving the Central District of 
California, including Orange and Los Angeles counties, without approval. 
</P>
<P>
 When Henley's attorneys petitioned the court for permission for him to travel 
with the team to road games outside the district, Taylor allowed him to do so 
only if Henley, or a "responsible third party" such as the Rams, could come up 
with $1 million bail.  
</P>
<P>
 Taylor also ordered that a U.S. marshal or pre-trial services officer 
accompany him on all road games -- even sitting beside him on the bench during 
the games -- to make sure Henley didn't flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Team officials were strongly opposed to the escort. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's attorneys suggested an increased bail of $2 million if Henley were 
allowed to travel without outside supervision. Taylor agreed, and in his ruling 
Friday said the Rams "may privately arrange for security to further supervise 
Mr. Henley." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors filed legal papers Friday opposing Henley's request to 
travel without a court escort, calling him a flight risk and a danger to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor kept all other aspects of his order intact, including a provision that 
Henley's salary should go into an escrow account controlled by a pretrial 
services officer who would provide Henley with living expenses and legal costs 
associated with the trial.

HELGESON FOLLOWS RIGHT IDEA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In her mind, Ginger Helgeson started winning her match against Conchita 
Martinez way back on Thursday, Aug. 4, during the women's tour event in San 
Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 Helgeson's chance, 29 days in the thinking, took 2 hours 7 minutes in the 
doing here Friday in the third round of the U.S. Open tennis tournament. 
</P>
<P>
 The Californian, ranked 40th, shocked this year's Wimbledon champion and 
third-seeded player here, 3-6, 6-4, 6-1, a major breakthrough for the 
25-year-old former Pepperdine star, who joked afterward that, among her other 
big moments was "a set over Martina (Navratilova) in TeamTennis." 
</P>
<P>
 The mental seed of victory was planted for Helgeson that Thursday last month 
in a 6-4, 6-3 defeat by Martinez in the round of 16 at the Toshiba Classic at 
La Costa, Helgeson's sixth consecutive defeat without a victory against the 
Spanish star. 
</P>
<P>
 "I played her really well in San Diego . . . and I felt that if her passing 
shots at that point were just a percentage off, I would have won that match," 
Helgeson said. "So I knew, going into this match, that I was going to play the 
same way." 
</P>
<P>
 She played the same, with slight modifications. 
</P>
<P>
 "The thing that was happening in the San Diego match was that I was making the 
first volley, but it was sitting up," she said. "You either have to drop-volley 
it against her, or really get your feet in position and volley it deep." 
</P>
<P>
 Friday, Helgeson avoided the mid-depth volleys that create easy passing shots 
for a player of Martinez's caliber. And after a crucial moment in the second 
set, Helgeson was in such complete control that Martinez appeared to drift 
aimlessly, from point to point, talking to herself or her courtside friend and 
rooter, Gigi Fernandez. 
</P>
<P>
 Martinez was rolling along at 6-3, 3-3, and had a break point against 
Helgeson. She ran Helgeson wide, then set up to hit an overhead for 4-3 and a 
crucial service break up. 
</P>
<P>
 And she missed. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was a really important point," Martinez said. "It would have been 4-3 for 
me, and my serve, which I wanted, so it would be 5-3 for me and the match is 
nearly over. But then you miss that shot, and you think the match, maybe. . . . 
" 
</P>
<P>
 Helgeson was asked what she had thought at that moment. 
</P>
<P>
 "I thought it was deuce," she deadpanned. 
</P>
<P>
 Although Helgeson will turn 26 on Sept. 14, she appears to have a chance for 
considerable success on the women's tour, with serve-and-volley skills that 
might carry her far against opponents who, for the most part, seem to stick to 
the baseline game and frequently come apart when confronted with something 
other than that. She approached the net 79 times against Martinez, a statistic 
seldom seen in matches not involving Navratilova on the women's tour. 
</P>
<P>
 Helgeson, the first three-time Minnesota state high school champion, still is 
eight classes short of a degree at Pepperdine, but she spent four years there 
and was an All-American from 1988-90. 
</P>
<P>
 She lives in Alpine, a community of about 11,000 in the mountains about 25 
miles east of San Diego. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's up, about 2,000 feet, and there's lots of land out there and the houses 
aren't on top of each other and you wake up to the birds," said Helgeson, who 
will be married in 23 days to Todd Neilsen. 
</P>
<P>
 Helgeson's quick feet and volleys are nicely complemented by a quick sense of 
humor. A tour press handout listed her answers to the following questions: 
</P>
<P>
 Question: What kinds of things annoy you? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: Lufthansa airport personnel. 
</P>
<P>
 Q. What phrase do you say most often? 
</P>
<P>
 A. Another round, please. 
</P>
<P>
 She was asked about a line in the media guide that said she enjoys working 
with pottery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Pottery?" she said. "I'm not that earthy." 
</P>
<P>
 And she was asked if Alpine was where they had the famous bakery. 
</P>
<P>
 "Yes," she replied. "And I try to stay away from it." 
</P>
<P>
 Helgeson's next match will be against Fernandez, who pulled hard for Martinez 
at courtside on Friday. Martinez, a few hours after she had lost the chance to 
play her friend, sat in the photographer's box courtside, rooting Fernandez on 
to a 6-3, 6-2 victory over Shi-Ting Wang of Taipei.

USC GETS GOING IN TOUGH WAY IN THIS OPENER; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: WASHINGTON 
PRESENTS TEST TODAY AS TROJANS' JOHNSON AND HUSKIES' KAUFMAN BEGIN THEIR 
HEISMAN BIDS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By EARL GUSTKEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Continuing a 71-year-old college football rivalry in a 71-year-old stadium 
that has just undergone a face lift, two 21-year-olds will come together today, 
both looking for a victory that could propel one of them toward the Heisman 
Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
 USC quarterback Rob Johnson and Washington tailback Napoleon Kaufman are the 
headliners in the 12:30 p.m. Pacific 10 season-opening game at the Coliseum, a 
contest fraught with risk as well as opportunity. 
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and Kaufman, both seniors, lead teams coming off good but not great 
seasons in 1993. The two players compiled All-American numbers, but their teams 
came up short in season-breaking games. 
</P>
<P>
 Both should set additional school career records well before the end of this 
season.  
</P>
<P>
 The 6-foot-4, 220-pound Johnson is 11 touchdown passes away from the USC 
record held by Rodney Peete. Johnson is already the career accuracy leader at 
63.6%. And if he has anything close to his 3,630-yard season of '93, he'll also 
pass Peete's career total of 8,225 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Kaufman is a 5-9, 185-pound rocket, one of the fastest and certainly the most 
explosive player in the Pac-10. He might also be, pound for pound, the 
strongest, bench pressing 420 pounds. 
</P>
<P>
 A California high school sprint champion at Lompoc in 1990, Kaufman broke for 
63 yards on his first carry as a Husky in 1991, and for 70 on his next carry.  
</P>
<P>
 His 1,299 rushing yards last year set a Washington season record, and he 
should become the school's career rushing leader before October. He is also a 
threat catching passes and returning kicks.  
</P>
<P>
 Second-year Coach Jim Lambright said: "We're going to try to get the ball in 
Napoleon's hands 30 to 35 times a game." 
</P>
<P>
 Obviously, USC's defensive challenge today is to prevent Kaufman from making 
game-breaking plays, but to do so in a way that doesn't leave them unprotected 
elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
 It's expected that Lambright will employ his All-American tight end, Mark 
Bruener, as a counterweight to the pressure Kaufman will attract. Bruener 
caught 30 passes last season and will become the Huskies' career tight-end 
receiving leader with his 21st catch this season. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans more or less contained Kaufman in their 22-17 victory at Seattle 
last year -- but not before their defensive coordinator, Don Lindsey, had 
experienced 60 minutes of agony. Kaufman gained 118 yards in 18 carries and 
nearly broke the game open half a dozen times.  
</P>
<P>
 Lindsey slumped in a chair and rolled his eyes recently, recalling USC's close 
call. "We got him by his shoe, by a piece of his shirt. . . . It was a 
miracle," he said. "We didn't dominate Washington defensively by a long shot, 
we sort of clawed and scraped our way through it." 
</P>
<P>
 USC Coach John Robinson, beginning the second season of his second Trojan 
tenure, was asked about opening the season against another conference power. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think there's a little bit in all of us (coaches) where we'd rather play 
Ralph's Pizza Parlor and win, 48-0," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "But that's not fun. Playing outstanding teams, that's fun." 
</P>
<P>
 The last time USC opened its season against a conference opponent, in 1967, 
John McKay's Trojans beat Washington State, 49-0, and went on to win the 
national championship.  
</P>
<P>
 Washington has opened its last three seasons against conference foes and won 
all three times. 
</P>
<P>
 Expectations are high in both Seattle and University Park. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington, which remains on conference probation and is not eligible for a 
bowl game, has 11 starters -- five on offense and six on defense -- returning 
from last season's team, which went 7-4 overall and 5-3 in the Pac-10. 
</P>
<P>
 USC (8-5, 6-2) has six offensive and four defensive starters back, 
complimenting what is described as one of the Trojans' best recruiting classes 
in years. 
</P>
<P>
 The Trojans expect to have an improved ground game, led by 225-pound tailback 
returnee Shawn Walters. He's being pressed by three incoming tailbacks -- 
Leonard Green, Delon Washington and Rodney Sermons. However, it was announced 
Friday that Green, a junior college transfer, would not play against the 
Huskies because of a hamstring pull. 
</P>
<P>
 The new fullback is sophomore David Dotson, who started briefly at tailback a 
year ago and showed prowess as a blocker. Robinson expects the new emphasis on 
running to help Johnson become an even more effective quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington's quarterback is junior Damon Huard, who had a stellar opener 
against Stanford a year ago, then tailed off markedly. He threw two 
interceptions in his first four games but finished the season with equal totals 
of interceptions and touchdowns, 10.  
</P>
<P>
 Both Robinson and Lambright have little depth at quarterback. Johnson's 
backup, Brad Otton, has never thrown a pass for USC. Huard's backup, Ted Stark, 
has thrown one for the Huskies. 
</P>
<P>
 Washington has lost one starter for today's game, linebacker Donovan Schmidt, 
who has a sprained ankle. 
</P>
<P>
 USC will be missing linebacker Gerald Caruthers, who injured his knee, in 
addition to Green, but new wide receiver Keyshawn Johnson, hobbled this week by 
a thigh bruise, is expected to play.  
</P>
<P>
 Rob Johnson, it should be noted, will have more than the usual home-field 
advantage. He helped rebuild the place.  
</P>
<P>
 Johnson and teammates Phalen Pounds, Tony Boselli, Kris Pollack, Ed Hervey and 
Brian Williams were part of the force that worked three shifts a day to finish 
the Coliseum's $60-million repair job after the Jan. 17 earthquake. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was a common laborer," Johnson said. "I swept up, picked up wood and trash. 
It wasn't much fun. But I love the Coliseum, and I'm happy I contributed in a 
small way. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a great stadium and it gives us a huge home-field advantage. Teams are 
intimidated when they go in there to play us." Trojan Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Two Trojan substitutes had knee surgery this week -- freshman wide 
receiver/cornerback Ken Haslip and sophomore safety Brent Lesjak. . . . The 
Coliseum staff will unveil the country's largest stadium video screen today, 
the new 62-ton, 44-foot-wide Diamond Vision. USC TROJANS

PRO FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; HANDLE WITH CARE; MILLER'S HISTORY OF 
INJURIES LOOMS OVER THE RAMS' SEASON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Maybe it was a rite of passage for former Oregon quarterbacks in the NFL, but 
Dan Fouts doesn't remember having any say in it. 
</P>
<P>
 Neither does Chris Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 Fouts was pounded by defenders in his 15 seasons with the San Diego Chargers, 
something Miller understands in six years with the Atlanta Falcons and now with 
the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 There was only one difference: Fouts kept coming back, game after game. 
</P>
<P>
 Considered one of the league's toughest quarterbacks, Fouts started 74 
consecutive games with the Chargers before a shoulder injury forced him to sit 
one out in 1983. 
</P>
<P>
 But injuries have prevented Miller from starting an entire NFL season, a 
streak he hopes to end this season despite playing behind a shaky Ram offensive 
line. 
</P>
<P>
 "Only two (quarterbacks) have played every game the past two years (the 
Buffalo 
</P>
<P>
 Bills' Jim Kelly and the San Francisco 49ers' Steve Young)," Miller said. 
"That's a pretty amazing statistic. 
</P>
<P>
 "You have to think, these guys are out here chasing you around and burying you 
every week, and sooner or later your body is going to give in." 
</P>
<P>
 And Miller's has given in, several times. 
</P>
<P>
 He has undergone two knee operations in the last two years -- the result of a 
non-contact injury -- and has sat out parts of the last seven seasons because 
of a bruised chest, cracked ribs, a sprained ankle, a sprained knee and a 
broken collarbone that required a steel plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "Chris has had it a lot rougher than I ever did," said Fouts, a Hall of Famer 
who set 19 passing records at Oregon, many that were later broken by Miller. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a big 'if' with those knees. And as for all his other injuries, I think 
Atlanta's offensive line didn't give him the best protection, and that's tough 
in an offense like the run-and-shoot." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller's most serious injury came when he was eluding a tackle by Ram safety 
Anthony Newman, his former college teammate, in a 1992 game at Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 One of Miller's feet got caught in a seam of the Georgia Dome's artificial 
turf and he suffered a severe knee injury. 
</P>
<P>
 A four-inch scar starts above Miller's right knee and stretches over the top 
of the kneecap, an incision that allowed surgeons to remove tendon, chunks of 
bone, shin and kneecap to repair the left knee. 
</P>
<P>
 Two screws remain in that knee, which required a second operation last 
October. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have had plenty of time to get it strong," Miller said. "The key thing for 
me was I had a good surgeon (for the second surgery). 
</P>
<P>
 "The first surgery, the techniques were in question and the knee wasn't as 
strong as it could be. But I was comfortable with the second surgery and the 
rehabilitation." 
</P>
<P>
 So were the Rams, who signed the free-agent to a three-year, $9-million 
contract after he cleared an extensive examination by team doctors. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams are banking on him to complement tailback Jerome Bettis by throwing 
high-percentage passes to the running backs, tight end Troy Drayton and 
occasionally wide receiver Flipper Anderson. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1991, Miller passed for 3,103 yards and 26 touchdowns. In three 
exhibitions, Miller completed 28 of 43 passes for 280 yards, but has yet to 
throw a touchdown pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "There are only two quarterbacks who can go out and win a game for you -- 
Steve Young and John Elway (of the Denver Broncos)," former Ram quarterback Pat 
Haden said. "There are a handful who can dominate a game. Then there's another 
tier of good quarterbacks, and Chris is at the top of that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's really accurate, and I think there will be a dramatic improvement in the 
play of the quarterback this season for the Rams. But the big 'if' is, can he 
stay healthy?" 
</P>
<P>
 Only seven quarterbacks started all 16 regular-season games last year -- 
Elway, Young, Kelly, Rick Mirer of the Seattle Seahawks, Brett Favre of the 
Green Bay Packers, Boomer Esiason of the New York Jets and Phil Simms of the 
New York Giants. 
</P>
<P>
 Jeff Hostetler of the Raiders, Craig Erickson of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, 
Neil O'Donnell of the Pittsburgh Steelers and Jim Harbaugh of the Chicago 
Bears, who is now with the Indianapolis Colts, each started 15 games. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can play 16 games," Miller said. "That's the bottom line. If you don't want 
to play that many, you're entering the season with the wrong outlook." 
</P>
<P>
 If Miller is sidelined, the Rams have veteran Chris Chandler and third-year 
player Tommy Maddox of UCLA waiting on the sidelines. 
</P>
<P>
 With Bettis, the Ram coaches have built a conservative, run-oriented offense 
that uses occasional play-action passes, which they hope will keep Miller out 
of harm's way. 
</P>
<P>
 With an aging Jackie Slater protecting Miller at right tackle and Giant 
castoff Clarence Jones at the other tackle, some of the top defensive ends and 
linebackers in the league will be bearing down on Miller in the first six weeks 
of the season: 
</P>
<P>
 Week 1 -- the Arizona Cardinals' Clyde Simmons. 
</P>
<P>
 Week 2 -- the Falcons' Chris Doleman. 
</P>
<P>
 Week 3 -- the 49ers' Richard Dent. 
</P>
<P>
 Week 4 -- the Kansas City Chiefs' Derrick Thomas. 
</P>
<P>
 Week 5 -- Doleman again. 
</P>
<P>
 Week 6 -- the Packers' Reggie White and Sean Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 Where's Gerald Perry when you need him? 
</P>
<P>
 "I feel good about our (offensive) line," Miller said. "There was a little 
skepticism at first about how they were going to come together. 
</P>
<P>
 "But to their credit, a lot of them haven't worked together before, and 
continuity is a key at that position. The longer they work together out here, 
the better I'll feel with them." 
</P>
<P>
 Miller has a tendency to hold onto the ball until the last second before 
throwing it, often leaving himself vulnerable to pass rushers. 
</P>
<P>
 A hit from a Washington defensive end in college left Miller unconscious, with 
a five-inch gash on the side of his helmet. 
</P>
<P>
 A few years ago, the Bills' Bruce Smith hit him on a touchdown pass, and 
Miller had to call a timeout to clear his dizziness before holding on the 
extra-point kick. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as being a tough man (goes), there's not too many quarterbacks who can 
stand there and stand there and wait until the last second and not get happy 
feet," the Rams' Newman said. "A lot of quarterbacks will get jittery and take 
off here or there, but Chris will stand there forever, throw the football and 
take a shot. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every time we played against Chris (when he was a Falcon), it was like, 'God, 
I hit him, I hit him right when he threw the ball.' But he threw it and he 
completed it for a touchdown. That happened how many times when we went against 
Chris? I don't know. 
</P>
<P>
 "That's a sign of toughness right there. I've been his teammate and I've 
played against him, and I'll tell you, he's the real deal."

QUICK COLQUITT GIVES UCLA LOTS TO WORRY ABOUT; COLLEGE FOOTBALL: HEATH SHULER'S 
REPLACEMENT AT TENNESSEE WILL BE CLOSELY WATCHED IN DEBUT AGAINST BRUINS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JIM HODGES, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 On Jan. 9, as people all over Tennessee crowded around radios and televisions 
to learn the future of the university's quarterback, Jerry Colquitt got in his 
car, punched up Boyz II Men and headed down the road. 
</P>
<P>
 He was the future. 
</P>
<P>
 And the future is now, beginning today at 5 p.m. at the Rose Bowl when 
Colquitt leads the 13th-ranked Volunteers in their season opener against No. 14 
UCLA. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been a long time coming, and if Heath Shuler had not decided to skip 
his senior season at Knoxville to go to the NFL, it might not have happened at 
all. It was a gamble, Colquitt's staying at Tennessee after Shuler had won the 
job in their sophomore years by leading a two-touchdown comeback against 
Georgia. 
</P>
<P>
 The competition had been so close, it had not been decided until that day in 
Athens, Ga., in the second game of the 1992 season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've always had the desire to go out and be the No. 1 guy, and if Heath had 
stayed, it would have had a great impact on my future," Colquitt said. "His 
leaving gave me a great opening and opportunity to play quarterback." 
</P>
<P>
 It is the No. 3 position in Tennessee, behind only the governor and the 
university's football coach -- the order changes at kickoff -- and to have been 
so close to the job has been frustrating. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have only one year to do it," Colquitt said. "The fact I've endured the 
hardship (of being No. 2) makes it all the more special. I've really paid a 
price with a lot of hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 He's the wild card in the Volunteers' deck. 
</P>
<P>
 They have all five starters back in an offensive line that could be college 
football's best, and running back James (Little Man) Stewart, who rushed for 
1,161 yards and eight touchdowns last season, is back, too. But Shuler, who 
passed for 2,354 yards and 25 touchdowns, was handing the ball to him. Now he 
is in the NFL, the third player picked in the draft and the first quarterback. 
Colquitt, who completed 19 of 26 passes for 233 yards and four touchdowns, with 
one interception, in spot duty, is the starter. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he's played, he's played well," said UCLA Coach Terry Donahue. "He was a 
great player in high school (at Oak Ridge, Tenn.), and he's a great athlete. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our biggest concern going into the game is his athletic ability at that 
position. Will he be so quick, so athletic that he makes our defense look 
slow?" 
</P>
<P>
 He might. Colquitt runs a 4.62-second 40-yard dash, but his long suit is 
throwing the ball. In a recent scrimmage, he was 10 for 10, and as a high 
school junior, he rallied Oak Ridge from a six-point deficit by taking the team 
96 yards in the final 80 seconds to beat Cleveland High. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Tennessee fans have that concern (about Colquitt's ability), I wish I 
could show them a film,' said Joe Gaddis, Colquitt's high school coach. 
</P>
<P>
 Leave it in Tennessee, say UCLA coaches. They don't want to see it. 
</P>
<P>
 They have problems of their own, beginning with learning how the Volunteers' 
secondary plans to play wide receiver J.J. Stokes. Can quarterback Wayne Cook 
get the ball to him? 
</P>
<P>
 "They will complete passes," said Tennessee safety Jason Parker. "Our job is 
to stop them from getting into the end zone." 
</P>
<P>
 Stokes is certainly no secret, but the Volunteer defense has played against 
talented receivers before. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd rather cover a 6-foot-5 receiver than cover a (5-8) David Palmer (of 
Alabama)," said Parker. "A 6-foot-5 receiver is a bigger target, but you can 
see him on the field. A David Palmer-type of receiver, he's so small, he can 
get into little creases and make catches." 
</P>
<P>
 Parker is one of three returning Tennessee defensive backs whose job will be 
made more difficult if an inexperienced defensive line can't pressure Cook. 
</P>
<P>
 But that's their problem. Colquitt's is solving a UCLA defense that has 
experience up front, but which has new starters at safety in Paul Guidry and 
Abdul McCullough. 
</P>
<P>
 And Colquitt must deal with the nervousness of his first start and the 
expectations of Tennessee fans, 8,000 of whom will be in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
 One way to do both might be to keep the ball on the ground until the 
butterflies go away. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think Tennessee will come out running the ball and try to run it all night, 
" said Donahue. "I think they will come out and pound it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Hopefully, there will be some passing situations that our defense can force 
them into." 
</P>
<P>
 That's fine with Colquitt, who has had enough questions about Shuler. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm finally going to get my chance to do what I've always wanted to do," 
Colquitt said. 
</P>
<P>
 His future is now, and it has been a long time coming. UCLA BRUINS TODAY'S

PRO FOOTBALL '94 / SEASON PREVIEWS; GETTING THE LAST LAUGH; RAIDER QUARTERBACK 
JEFF HOSTETLER TAKES WINNING -- AND HIS PRANKS -- SERIOUSLY 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 Art Shell got it in an elevator. 
</P>
<P>
 Bill Meyers got it in his car. 
</P>
<P>
 Howie Long got it at home. 
</P>
<P>
 Sooner or later, they all get it, one way or another. Sooner or later, most 
who work with quarterback Jeff Hostetler get caught on the receiving end of one 
of his practical jokes. 
</P>
<P>
 He's got standards, mind you: No damage to the body. No damage to personal 
property. But plenty of damage to one's peace of mind. 
</P>
<P>
 Now all of this might seem strange, coming from Hostetler. 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't he the deeply religious, deadly serious leader of the Raiders? 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't he the man who resolutely rose from the ground time and again last 
season, no matter how many crushing blows he had suffered, and hobbled back to 
the huddle, waving off concerned trainers and coaches, determined to persevere 
and win a football game? 
</P>
<P>
 Isn't he the New York transplant who came west to escape the persecution of 
rabid Giant fans? 
</P>
<P>
 With all that in mind, Hostetler doesn't strike you as a man who secretly 
harbors a desire to put on a big red nose and squirt water from a flower in his 
lapel. 
</P>
<P>
 And he isn't. He is more subtle than that. But equally mischievous. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler learned in high school that practical jokes can serve two purposes 
on a football team: promote camaraderie and relieve tension. 
</P>
<P>
 And there was plenty of tension to be relieved on the Raiders a year ago. The 
club was coming off a 7-9 season. The emotional scars from the departure of 
Marcus Allen had not yet healed. And after suffering through a series of 
erratic quarterbacks, the Raiders weren't sure Hostetler was the man to put 
them back on course. 
</P>
<P>
 So when he wasn't throwing touchdown passes, running into the end zone himself 
or shaking off the effects of yet another sack, Hostetler kept his troops loose 
and laughing. 
</P>
<P>
 There was the night Long, now a Fox commentator, came into his hotel room and 
found a dead fish in his bed with a note that read, "You're just a little fish 
in my pond." 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler got Shell when the two of them were in a hotel elevator. Hostetler 
got off at the 11th floor. Shell was going to the 21st. Before departing, 
Hostetler punched every button from 11 to 21. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he was gone, leaving his coach with a long, slow, irritating journey. 
</P>
<P>
 "He got me," said Shell, shaking his head but smiling. The coach, of course, 
will let Hostetler push all the buttons he wants off the field as long as he 
continues to push the right ones on the field. 
</P>
<P>
 But even in Hostetler's world of mischief, there are rules. And Meyers broke 
the one about damaged property. 
</P>
<P>
 The offensive line coach cut the toe strap on one of Hostetler's thongs. 
</P>
<P>
 That's a no-no. 
</P>
<P>
 Sure enough, when Meyers came out after a meeting, his vehicle was up on 
blocks. 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Hostetler does not always enjoy the last laugh. 
</P>
<P>
 After a victory last season at the Coliseum, he showered and returned to his 
locker only to discover his clothes missing. He had to borrow from here and 
there simply to get home. Long and offensive lineman Steve Wisniewski were 
thought to be the culprits, but no one was talking. 
</P>
<P>
 "There's a lot of pressure involved in playing," Hostetler said, "and 
sometimes you just need some things to break it up and get your mind off it. I 
think being mentally prepared for a football game is the most important thing 
as a player, so I never want to detract from that." 
</P>
<P>
 There were plenty of distractions in New York, where Hostetler landed as a 
third-round draft choice in 1984 after an All-American career at West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 It was so tough getting on the field at Giants Stadium, because of the 
presence of Phil Simms, that Hostetler played on special teams before he played 
as a quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
 How many quarterbacks in NFL history can say they blocked a punt before they 
completed a pass? 
</P>
<P>
 When Simms got hurt, Hostetler got his chance, leading the Giants to victory 
over the Buffalo Bills, 20-19, in Super Bowl XXV. Hostetler completed 20 of 32 
passes for 222 yards and a touchdown in that game. 
</P>
<P>
 But loyal followers of Simms weren't happy with the man they regarded as an 
intruder, despite his heroics. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler found negative comments scratched in his driveway and his kids were 
harassed in school. 
</P>
<P>
 "Things like that had no place in what I felt was a responsible response to 
football," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 The era of free agency gave Hostetler a chance to pack up his family and start 
anew on the other side of the country. He signed a three-year, $7.5-million 
contract with the Raiders in the spring of 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler put New York far behind him, but not the controversy. He was known 
as a ball-control quarterback who excelled at throwing short, accurate passes. 
But he was coming to a club that specialized in long passes. 
</P>
<P>
 Would it work? 
</P>
<P>
 Even the Raiders weren't sure at first. They were known to still be interested 
in quarterback Jeff George at this time last year, should Hostetler falter at 
the start of the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler won the opener over the Minnesota Vikings, 24-7. Well and good, but 
he did it by taking advantage of a defensive secondary that was conceding short 
passes. Hostetler completed 23 of 27, including 15 in a row for a Raider 
record. 
</P>
<P>
 Was he really going to be the heir to Daryle Lamonica, known as the Mad 
Bomber, and Ken Stabler? 
</P>
<P>
 As a matter of fact, on occasion, Hostetler would prove even better. Against 
the San Diego Chargers, he erased all doubts about his firepower, throwing for 
a club-record 424 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler also set a record for Raider quarterbacks with five rushing 
touchdowns, the top total on the team in '93. 
</P>
<P>
 For the season, he completed 236 of 419 passes for 3,242 yards and 14 
touchdowns, all personal highs. Hostetler also threw 10 interceptions, equaling 
his total of the previous four seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only did they finally have a trigger for their long-range arsenal, but a 
wider range of targets as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's got a steady head on his shoulders," said Tim Brown, Hostetler's 
favorite receiver last season. "He's a football player. Every snap is not going 
to be a 40- to 45-yard pass. It may be a three- or four-yard gain instead. So, 
instead of second and 12, we have second and six or second and seven. He 
doesn't like to throw long every time. I don't think that's his game." 
</P>
<P>
 Brown and his teammates were equally impressed with Hostetler last season when 
he didn't throw the ball, but instead took the full force of a 280-pounder 
slamming him to the ground, then struggled to his feet, ready for more. The 
only heated discussions Hostetler had with Shell last season involved his 
ability to go back into the game. 
</P>
<P>
 The conversations would always end the same: 
</P>
<P>
 Shell: "You OK?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler: "I'm fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell: "You want to sit out?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler: "I'm fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Shell: "You know where you are?" 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler: "I'm fine." 
</P>
<P>
 "I struggled (with injuries) from the third game on," Hostetler said. "After 
the season, I sat back and wondered how I really made it through." 
</P>
<P>
 His teammates noticed. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a tough guy playing quarterback for us," defensive tackle Nolan 
Harrison said. "We've got a tough (reputation) as a team, and the last thing we 
would want is a quarterback who did not represent that. 
</P>
<P>
 "He inspires loyalty in us. People want to follow a guy like that. He doesn't 
just talk about it. He has this incredible passion to win and he just keeps 
coming. This league is not for the patsy quarterbacks who the new rules help to 
protect, guys who like to throw the ball away to avoid a sack. We really 
respect a guy like Jeff who just keeps coming, and there are not a lot of 
quarterbacks who can (do) that." 
</P>
<P>
 But Hostetler's determination and toughness should not be a surprise. What 
would you expect from a player who, as a kid, had to withstand electric-shock 
treatment at the hands of his older brothers? 
</P>
<P>
 Hostetler and his three brothers would play football between household chores 
in Pennsylvania. But older brothers Ron and Doug had this nasty habit of 
grabbing one of Jeff's hands in order to subject him to the full force of a 
nearby electric fence. 
</P>
<P>
 If Jeff cried about that or their rough tactics in the family football games, 
the older Hostetlers threatened to quit. 
</P>
<P>
 So young Jeff learned to suffer in silence. 
</P>
<P>
 And he still does when he meets up with the likes of Reggie White or Junior 
Seau, figures far more shocking to those in their path than any fence. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's a good guy to have around," Brown said. "So full of life and enthusiasm. 
He can run the offense and put hot sauce in Howie Long's drink. You can never 
relax when he's around." 
</P>
<P>
 Not if you're on the opposing team. 
</P>
<P>
 And certainly not if you're on his team.

OBSCURE SPRINTER'S RISE, FALL SYMBOLIZE DOPING NIGHTMARE; TRACK & FIELD: 
EFFORTS TO ADVANCE SPORT CONTINUALLY UNDERMINED BY DRUG INCIDENTS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RANDY HARVEY, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 He comes from Sierra Leone, a small African country with such an impoverished 
Olympic committee that it was unable to provide him with anything other than a 
track and field singlet, shorts and a warm-up suit for the recent Commonwealth 
Games. Embarrassed because he had no fashionable blazer like the athletes from 
other countries, he refused to march in the opening ceremony. 
</P>
<P>
 He was not missed. Few among the crowd that day in Victoria, Canada, had ever 
heard of Horace Dove-Edwin, a young sprinter with an unremarkable personal best 
time in the 100 meters of 10.34 seconds. 
</P>
<P>
 Within three days, he emerged not only as one of track and field's most 
promising new faces by finishing second to British Olympic champion Linford 
Christie in the 100 meters but also as an example to athletes from his and 
other developing nations. 
</P>
<P>
 The Royal Commonwealth Society of Canada presented him with a special 
citation, which read: "His joy at winning the silver medal, the first for his 
country, was communicated to the whole crowd. A wonderful tribute to his 
nation." 
</P>
<P>
 The fact that he ran the race in 10.02, an astonishing improvement over his 
previous best, should have set off sirens in the heads of those who follow 
track and field, but even if it had, they could not have been heard over the 
applause for Dove-Edwin, for the training camp in La Grange, Ga., established 
to assist Third World athletes and for the International Olympic Committee, 
which had paid for him to attend. 
</P>
<P>
 Before the end of the fortnight, reporters who had promoted the story of the 
blazer-less sprinter with blazing speed to folk legend status were called 
together in Victoria for the announcement that Dove-Edwin had tested positive 
for stanozolol, the same anabolic steroid that felled Canadian sprinter Ben 
Johnson during the Olympic Games at Seoul. 
</P>
<P>
 That was six years ago. As current stars such as Christie, British hurdlers 
Colin Jackson and Sally Gunnell, U.S. long jumper Jackie Joyner-Kersee, Cuban 
high jumper Javier Sotomayor, Ukrainian pole vaulter Sergei Bubka and Algerian 
miler Noureddine Morceli compete here today in the Mobil Grand Prix Final near 
the end of another outdoor season, they find that their efforts to advance the 
sport on the track continue to be undermined by drugs. 
</P>
<P>
 It has been particularly frustrating for British Athletic Federation 
officials, who were among the first to declare war against anabolic steroids 
and other banned performance-enhancing substances and have armed themselves 
with frequent random, unannounced tests and severe penalties. 
</P>
<P>
 Within recent weeks, however, six British track and field athletes have tested 
positive, and one, world-class half-miler Diane Modahl, was discovered to have 
a level of the male hormone testosterone in her system that was four times 
higher than Johnson's when he was suspended for his second offense in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Furthermore, BAF officials, as often occurs with their U.S. counterparts, find 
themselves in the awkward position of defending Modahl because of alleged 
testing irregularities in a highly publicized dispute with International 
Amateur Athletic Federation officials that threatens to obscure next week's 
World Cup in London. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seems a ridiculous situation where drugs is leading the 9 o'clock and the 
10 o'clock news; things are not that bad," said Jackson, the world 
record-holder in the 110-meter high hurdles. "I have just clocked 13.02, and 
all people want to talk about is drugs." 
</P>
<P>
 In an interview during this week's Olympic Centennial Congress, IAAF President 
Primo Nebiolo said: "I want to stress that doping is a very serious problem. 
But it is not the problem of track and field. Doping is the problem of all 
sports." 
</P>
<P>
 He pointed to recent headlines associating banned substances with cycling, 
swimming, diving, weightlifting, boxing and soccer. But, he emphasized, IAAF 
officials are not underestimating the problem within their sport. 
</P>
<P>
 They are, he said, aggressively pursuing athletes who use drugs, describing a 
system of flying hit squads that arrive unannounced in countries and select 
athletes for testing during training. 
</P>
<P>
 But as important as it might be to police the athletes, it has become 
increasingly apparent that it is equally necessary to watch the watchdogs. IOC 
officials contend that steps have been taken to prevent a situation such as 
occurred 10 years ago during the Los Angeles Olympics, in which documents 
revealing positive tests were destroyed. At other levels, however, 
irregularities remain. 
</P>
<P>
 Modahl allegedly tested positive on June 18, but the initial report remained 
on the desk of a vacationing Portuguese track and field official for five weeks 
before it was passed on to the IAAF. The runner was not summoned for testing of 
her "B" sample until last Monday. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our lawyer is working very hard on the case," said Modahl's husband, 
Vincente, thus guaranteeing another long, depressing off-season for the sport's 
faithful.

<P>
 The 21-year-old Van Impe, who signed a multiyear contract, had 43 goals and 
111 assists in 112 games in two seasons with Red Deer of the Western Hockey 
League. He was selected 170th overall by the Islanders in the 1993 draft. 
</P>
<P>
 The Ducks also signed Jeremy Stevenson and Brian Sullivan.

 Stevenson, a left wing, was the team's 11th-round selection in the 1994 entry 
draft. He scored 43 points in 57 games with Sault Ste. Marie of the Ontario 
Hockey League last season. Sullivan, a free-agent right wing, scored 61 points

MCNALL'S DIFFICULTIES GAIN LITTLE SYMPATHY

 Your ombudsman Bruce McNall characterization doesn't cut it. Sorry, but I'm 
not aware of any Kings fans who can relate to a confessed coin smuggler waiting 
to go to the big house for swindling banks out of millions, who in the process 
betrayed several employees of whom also will be going to prison.

 Bruce McNall is the quintessential poster boy for professional sports in the 
1990s. A soon-to-be- admitted and convicted felon . . . a liar, a cheat and a 
thief who doesn't "feel bad about all the things I've done in the past" 
("McNall Says Hockey Reality Much More Than an Illusion," Aug. 25). 
</P>
<P>
 It would seem that the pronouncements of McNall as a financial genius were 
slightly premature. Stealing a fortune is a lot easier than making one.

BOXING / TIM KAWAKAMI; DESPITE HARD WORK, TOO MANY SHOTS HAVE STOPPED PADILLA 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By TIM KAWAKAMI 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Take a rest? Zack Padilla had already taken a self-imposed three-year break 
from boxing, so once he got back in, he was in for good, every day in every 
way. 
</P>
<P>
 Rest on his laurels? He won a title in June last year, and went back into the 
gym shortly thereafter. 
</P>
<P>
 Back off and take it easy? Sometimes it seemed that Padilla was trying to make 
up for his three-year sabbatical all at once. If he ever took a backward step 
during a professional bout, it was neither recorded by video nor noticed by 
those who watched him fight. 
</P>
<P>
 Then he would jump back into seven-, eight- and 10-round sparring sessions 
with lightweight prospect Shane Mosley as quickly as his body would allow. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla was preparing for a hoped-for fight with Pernell Whitaker, considered 
the best pound-for-pound fighter in the world and the gateway to riches Padilla 
had, as yet, not experienced. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zack is a down-to-earth person," Mosley said. "He doesn't let stardom get to 
him like: 'I'm the champion, I don't have to do this.' He realizes what it took 
to get him the title, and that's what it takes to keep him there. One thing: 
hard work." 
</P>
<P>
 But Tuesday at the Azusa Boxing Club, Padilla's body finally wouldn't allow it 
any more. 
</P>
<P>
 Although suffering from severe headaches since his last bout, a 10-round 
technical knockout of Juan LaPorte on July 24 to retain the World Boxing 
Organization junior-welterweight title, Padilla was sparring with Mosley, who 
will fight at the Grand Olympic Auditorium next Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 After five rounds at their usual, fast pace, Mosley noticed that Padilla 
looked woozy. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I spar with him, he's usually attacking me the whole time," Mosley said. 
"And when I came out for the sixth round, I feinted at him, and instead of 
doing what he usually does, rock back and throw punches, he kind of flinched 
and wobbled. I thought, 'Wait a minute, that's not Zack.' 
</P>
<P>
 "He just kind of looked at me, was about to continue, thought about it and 
said, 'Naw, I'm not feeling good. I feel kind of dizzy.' And we just stopped 
right there." 
</P>
<P>
 The 31-year-old Padilla went to a hospital, where a blood clot was discovered 
near his brain. Although his life is apparently not in jeopardy, he has told 
friends he probably will retire from boxing. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if he doesn't retire, state boxing officials have said they would be 
unlikely to allow him to fight again. 
</P>
<P>
 Padilla has a 22-1-1 record, which is not very many fights, but has taken more 
shots per bout than most boxers. In one computer-tallied fight, Padilla and Ray 
Oliviera threw a combined 3,024 punches in 12 rounds, a PunchStat record. 
</P>
<P>
 The LaPorte fight was brutal, with both men landing heavy blows every round. 
LaPorte lost when he couldn't answer the bell for the 11th round. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think it was from the sparring, just from the fights he's had," 
Mosley said. "The accumulation of fights. Especially the one with Juan LaPorte. 
He's just had a lot of tough fights and I guess he has to give his body time to 
heal." 
</P>
<P>
 Said former world bantamweight champion Richie Sandoval, a close friend of 
Padilla's: "It could be a sign that says, 'Hey, you gave it a good run, it's 
time to move on.' 
</P>
<P>
 "Some fighters never seem to understand. They go on and go on and go on and 
wait for a tragedy to happen." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Although saddened by the development, most were not surprised or particularly 
alarmed. They know boxing is violent, that the object is to avoid getting hit 
as well as to hit one's opponent. 
</P>
<P>
 "Zack Padilla was known to fight brutal fights," said Ignacio Beristein, 
trainer of Humberto (Chiquita) Gonzalez and many others. "He would take a lot 
of punishment and he would always go in there using force and without 
technique. He would go in there and fight -- land punches and receive punches. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe he's paying the consequences right now because he's had too many wars, 
like with (Carlos) Bolillo Gonzalez (to win the WBO title) and some other 
fighters who really put some hands on him. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe his trainers or his manager, what they should have done was teach him, 
instead of always using force, to try some other technique that would allow him 
to avoid getting hit as much as he was." 
</P>
<P>
 Genaro Hernandez, World Boxing Assn. junior-lightweight champion, agreed. 
</P>
<P>
 "In every fight, he gets hit a lot. He doesn't make any body movement or stuff 
like that," Hernandez said. "It's obvious it's going to catch up to you sooner 
or later. Eventually, it caught up to him." 
</P>
<P>
 Does Hernandez believe aggressive, daily sparring sessions are harmful? 
</P>
<P>
 "We try just to go and work out, not to go in there and make it a war zone," 
Hernandez said. "This is a school to us . . . we're there just to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people that come and work out with me, if they come out and try to hurt 
me, I lay a couple of shots in there. That way I can show them, 'Hey, I'm not 
going to take anything from you.' 
</P>
<P>
 "But after we work out, I tell them, look, we're here to work out, not to kill 
each other. You try to kill each other up in the real ring, when you're going 
to make some money. You're not getting paid here, so take it easy." 
</P>
<P>
 The irony, according to Mosley, is that Padilla was trying to change his style 
in preparation for an eventual bout with Whitaker. He was attempting to learn 
how to play defense. 
</P>
<P>
 "He was getting ready to fight Sweet Pea, and he was practicing different 
things, keeping his hands up higher than he used to, and I think he was getting 
his mind set for that," Mosley said. "That's really why he came to the gym 
earlier than usual (after the LaPorte fight), to work on that." Boxing Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Although one executive at Top Rank, Inc., has said that Oscar De La Hoya vs. 
Paul Gonzales would be an exciting fight to promote, Top Rank President Bob 
Arum isn't thrilled by the prospect. "It wouldn't be a good fight," Arum said. 
"I'm not taking it seriously at all. I think it's all bull." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya, angered by the recent harsh words directed at him by Gonzales, who 
preceded De La Hoya as an East Los Angeles-born Olympic gold medalist, directed 
trainer Robert Alcazar to see if Gonzales was serious about fighting him. More 
than a fight, sources close to De La Hoya said, he thinks he deserves an 
apology from Gonzales, who is nine years older, recently retired, and was at 
his best at 112 pounds. De La Hoya is fighting in the 135-pound division. "This 
is just a personal thing," a source said. "These two guys used to be friends. 
They should talk and get past this." 
</P>
<P>
 De La Hoya is scheduled to fight on Oct. 8 at the Grand Olympic Auditorium 
against an opponent to be decided upon -- it definitely won't be Gonzalez, Arum 
said, because he knows CBS matchmaker Gil Clancy would reject that fight -- and 
possibly again on Nov. 18 on the Roy Jones-James Toney undercard. Neither bout, 
as of now, is scheduled to be for De La Hoya's World Boxing Organization 
lightweight title. 
</P>
<P>
 An interested bystander is Genaro Hernandez, a champion in his prime who has 
been seeking to fight De La Hoya for more than a year. "That fight would be a 
disgrace to boxing because in reality Paul Gonzales, he's a flyweight," 
Hernandez said. "He's a friend of mine. I would hate to see him get up in the 
ring and get hurt. (Top Rank executive Dan) Goossen came out and said it would 
be a terrific fight. It will not be a good fight, everybody knows that. Paul 
Gonzales, his time is through." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of L.A.'s most talented young featherweights, 22-year-old Arnulfo (Chico) 
Castillo and Robert Garcia, 19, kept their records perfect last week and are 
heading for an eventual showdown. Garcia (15-0, 12 knockouts) defeated veteran 
Frankie Avelar last Saturday at the Olympic in two rounds, then was on hand for 
Castillo's fifth-round technical knockout over Francisco Valdez Monday at the 
Forum. Castillo is 14-0 with nine knockouts. Garcia's next fight will be on 
Sept. 24 at the Olympic. . . . Also on that card will be junior-lightweight 
Pepe Reilly, who showed off his new overhand right in his last bout at the 
Olympic. "Yeah, it's kind of my secret weapon," said Reilly, who has always 
been known for his left hook. "I never used it much, but now I'm using it in 
combination with my left hook to the body. If one doesn't get there, the other 
will." Calendar 
</P>
<P>
 Wednesday: Rafael (Bazooka) Limon vs. John Armijo, junior-welterweights; 
Huntington Park Casino, 7:30 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday: Danny Romero vs. Manuel Jesus Herrera, flyweights; Shane Mosley vs. 
Louis Ramirez, lightweights; Grand Olympic Auditorium, 5:30 p.m.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAIDERS; SHELL SAYS TEAM IS REALLY READY FOR 49ERS 
</P>

<P>
 Sixteen days is a long time between football games, but that's virtually how 
long it will be for many Raider starters Monday night when they play the San 
Francisco 49ers in the season opener at Candlestick Park. 
</P>
<P>
 After the Raider regulars had played the first half of the exhibition against 
the Rams on Aug. 20, the team's attention effectively shifted to the 49ers. 
</P>
<P>
 That's why quarterback Jeff Hostetler did not play in the final exhibition at 
Houston and many other starters were used sparingly. 
</P>
<P>
 "The guys are really ready to go," Coach Art Shell said Friday at the team's 
El Segundo practice site. "I like the idea of having a long week, since we've 
really had an extra week to prepare. But you can tell the guys are chomping at 
the bit to play." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 In the last three seasons, the 49er passing attack, led by quarterback Steve 
Young and wide receiver Jerry Rice, has been rated as possibly the best in the 
NFL. Shell, however, was not in the mood to talk about the 49ers. He wanted to 
focus on his own passing game instead. 
</P>
<P>
 "Tim Brown and the rest of our wide receivers are the best combination in the 
league," Shell said. "I wouldn't put our combination of receivers and 
quarterback second to anyone in the league."  
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Raiders have a 30-10-1 Monday night record; the 49ers are 21-15. The 
Raiders, however, have lost four of their last five Monday night games; the 
49ers have won five of their last six. . . . With the baseball strike 
continuing, the 49ers will cover the infield dirt used by the San Francisco 
Giants for Monday night's game. . . . Former Raider Bo Jackson, now with the 
Angels, visited his old teammates this week. Jackson, who played his last game 
for the Raiders in 1990, worked out in the Raider weight room. LONNIE WHITE

PRO FOOTBALL / SEASON PREVIEWS; RULE CHANGES ARE MEANT TO INCREASE ACTION, 
SCORING; NFL: TWO-POINT CONVERSIONS, MORE RETURNS OF KICKOFFS, BETTER 
PROTECTION FOR PASSERS AND RECEIVERS AND COACHES' RADIOS ARE EXPECTED TO HELP 
ENLIVEN GAMES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Notice to NFL fans this season: No more dawdling come game time; no more 
bathroom breaks until after the not-so-automatic conversion attempt; no more 
fantasy football league titles determined by long-range field goals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The rule changes we have this year are the most dramatic since I came into 
the game," said Wayne Sevier, who coaches the Rams' special teams. "We're 
talking four major changes with the most drastic being the two-point 
conversion." 
</P>
<P>
 * Rule Change 1: The opening kickoff now becomes mandatory viewing. It will be 
from the 30-yard line, rather than the 35. Instead of the ball being downed in 
the end zone on many kickoffs and brought out to the 20, now it usually will be 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
 "If a kicker put 20% of his kicks in the end zone last year and they weren't 
returned, that was considered a great job," Sevier said. "You won't see anybody 
come close to that this year." 
</P>
<P>
 * Rule Change 2: New kicking tees will further handicap the kickers and ensure 
more returns. Instead of elevating the ball three inches, which allows for more 
hang-time, kickers must use one-inch tees. 
</P>
<P>
 "With a three-inch tee you were looking at a good hang-time of 4.3 seconds," 
said Tony Zendejas, Ram kicker. "Now, if you get anywhere around four seconds 
it will be a good kick." 
</P>
<P>
 * Rule Change 3: Teams will now, in effect, be penalized seven-eight yards for 
missing a field goal from beyond the 20-yard line, because the ball will be 
spotted at the point of the attempt rather than the line of scrimmage. A year 
ago there were 120 attempts from 50 yards or beyond. Now, coaches might not be 
so quick to call on kickers, making more use of their punters. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think you're going to see fewer long field goals," Sevier said. "The better 
pooch punters become more valuable to their teams." 
</P>
<P>
 * Rule Change 4: Teams will have the option to kick for one point after a 
touchdown or go for two on a run or pass. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think you're going to see many people go for it," Sevier said. "But 
the minute somebody gets you with the two-point conversion, you're going to 
look like an idiot." 
</P>
<P>
 With that in mind, the Rams hired possibly the smartest special teams coach in 
the NFL, Sevier. 
</P>
<P>
 "We call him the czar of special teams," said Joe Bugel, former Cardinal head 
coach and an assistant previously with Sevier in Washington. "Without a doubt, 
he's one of the better ones, if not the best. What a tremendous motivator. He 
can take a good football player and make him a really great special teams 
player." 
</P>
<P>
 Between successful tours of duty in Washington, Sevier resurrected the 
Chargers' miserable special teams and made them tops in the league. 
</P>
<P>
 "I saw it from Day 1," Zendejas said. "He demanded everyone's attention and 
didn't care if you were a star player or not. It's unbelievable how attentive 
he is to every detail. Every individual knows exactly what he must do." 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Sevier and other coaches must be prepared to handle the game as it 
changes. 
</P>
<P>
 Teams will need more speed on their kickoff coverage teams to keep the 
opposition from gaining a decisive field-position advantage. Speedy kickoff 
returners will have the opportunity to become household names. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the teams that will come out of this the best in the return game will 
be the teams with the least amount of penalties," Sevier said. "You will get 
some good field position on the kickoff return, but what will kill it will be 
the penalties." 
</P>
<P>
 Zendejas kicked off 58 times last season, put the ball into the end zone 16 
times and put it into the end zone deep enough to keep the opposition from 
returning it nine times. 
</P>
<P>
 "What I'm going to ask him to do (this season) is not place it, but get the 
best possible kick for us and then we'll cover that kick," Sevier said. "We're 
just looking for the best combination of depth and hang time." 
</P>
<P>
 The rule changes will also force coaches to make tougher decisions. Do they 
risk going for a 50-yard field goal and turning the ball over to their opponent 
at the 40 if the kicker misses? 
</P>
<P>
 "I've told Tony, 'If you want to kick the 50-yarders, just make them,' " 
Sevier said.  
</P>
<P>
 Head coaches will have two-point conversion plays in their playbook. But will 
they use then? In college, if a team misses an extra point early, it usually 
goes for two after its next touchdown. Will the pros? If a team trails by one 
point with 12 seconds remaining, does the coach go for the tie, and take his 
chances in overtime, or the victory? 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the formal rule changes, there is another change -- a 
coach-to-quarterback radio, the first regular-season approved field 
communication system. The quarterback has two small speakers mounted inside his 
helmet, but he can only receive, not send, transmissions. 
</P>
<P>
 An official, employed by the NFL, operates a cut-off box on the press-box 
level. The communication is turned off with 15 seconds remaining on the play 
clock or when the quarterback breaks the huddle. This prevents a coach from 
changing the play after seeing the defense adjusting. 
</P>
<P>
 During the exhibition season, teams used the new system with mixed results. 
Some coaches don't like it, fearing glitches and the possibility of opponents 
picking up their signals. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL, however, claims that opponents cannot pick up calls because of an 
intricate scrambling system that prevents one team from intercepting the 
other's communication.  
</P>
<P>
 Raider Coach Art Shell supports the new system and used it throughout the 
exhibition season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I know that some teams have not taken advantage of the system yet, but we use 
it all the time," he said. "Every now and then, the signal breaks up a little 
bit, but for the most part, it is a positive for the game." 
</P>
<P>
 The biggest problem according to Shell is that occasionally the quarterback 
pretends not to hear the call. 
</P>
<P>
 "Sometimes I do wonder whether (Raider quarterback) Jeff (Hostetler) can hear 
us and just says he can't because he doesn't agree with what we're calling," 
Shell said. 
</P>
<P>
 Another new field communication system, the Audiblizer, was used during the 
exhibition season but has not been approved for the regular season. 
</P>
<P>
 The system uses a cluster of loudspeakers, placed well beyond the sidelines, 
to amplify the quarterback's voice. The speakers help override crowd noise, 
allowing the offensive team a fair opportunity once it gets inside an 
opponent's 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 The Audiblizer might be approved for the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
 To use it, the quarterback pushes a button on the side of his helmet. Three 
technicians behind the team benches deactivate the system after 25 seconds, 
upon the snap of the ball or the referee's whistle. 
</P>
<P>
 The NFL tested the system in 20 exhibitions. 
</P>
<P>
 Times staff writer Lonnie White contributed to this story. 1994 NFL Rules 
Changes 
</P>
<P>
 The significant rule changes in the NFL for the 1994 season: PACE OF GAME AND 
SCORING 
</P>
<P>
 * Coach-to-quarterback radio -- Coaches can send in plays directly to their 
quarterbacks through radio transmission, resulting in better time management 
between plays that could mean, especially in noisy stadiums, a more efficient 
offense. 
</P>
<P>
 * Two-point conversion -- Teams can now either run or pass for two points or 
kick for one point from the two-yard line. The two-point conversion rule was 
used in the American Football League from 1960-69. KICKING GAME 
</P>
<P>
 * Kickoffs from the 30 -- The kickoff spot will be moved back to the 30-yard 
line (instead of the 35) and a tee of no higher than one inch will be allowed. 
More kickoffs will be returned. 
</P>
<P>
 * Spot of missed field goals -- If a field-goal attempt is missed from beyond 
the 20-yard line, the ball will be brought back to the spot of the kick instead 
of the line of scrimmage. This seven-yard difference will reduce the number of 
long field-goal attempts. PASSING GAME 
</P>
<P>
 * Chucking -- Defenders are allowed to extend their arms to slow down a 
receiver ("chuck" him) only within five yards of the line of scrimmage. 
Enforcement will allow receivers to get into their routes quicker. 
</P>
<P>
 * Roughing the passer -- Tighter enforcement of rule to penalize defenders for 
unnecessarily punishing a passer or hitting him after the pass is released 
(rather than after completion of throwing motion). LINE PLAY 
</P>
<P>
 * Deeper alignment for offensive lineman -- Lineman can now line up deeper off 
the ball, affording better pass protection for the quarterback. It also allows 
them to see the snap of the ball, which will help where crowd noise hinders 
hearing of the snap count. 
</P>
<P>
 * Restrictions on defensive players -- To prevent the offense from being 
induced to jump off-side, if a defensive lineman enters the neutral zone and 
causes the offense to move, the penalty will now be called on the defense.

PRO FOOTBALL / DAILY REPORT; RAMS; RYAN'S COMMENTS PROVIDE MOTIVATION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 After the Rams had no trouble with Buddy Ryan's Houston defense a year ago in 
a 28-13 victory, Ryan had some unkind things to say about his opponents. The 
Rams remember those comments and find motivation in wanting to begin the 1994 
season with a victory over Ryan's Arizona Cardinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "Buddy Ryan came up and said we were the worst-coached team, the worst-run 
football team and had the worst football players in the league," said Joe Vitt, 
Ram assistant head coach. "That doesn't say much for the football team he was 
coaching after we absolutely pummeled them and stomped them into the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 "I tried to walk up and talk to him at the NFL scouting combine, but he didn't 
want any part of me. He's not going to look you in the eye like a man unless 
there are some cameras around." 
</P>
<P>
 Ryan's arrival in Phoenix resulted in an increased sale of 24,000 season 
tickets, but Vitt can't understand what all the excitement is about. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just think he's another guy," Vitt said. "I just wish it were a playoff 
game, I'd guarantee a victory. He's never won a playoff game. 
</P>
<P>
 "We know we have to go out and earn respect. What we don't need is somebody 
from another team critiquing us. I would think he's got enough of his own 
problems. For one thing, hitting the speed bag would help him after the pitiful 
punch I saw him throw at (Oiler offensive coordinator Kevin) Gilbride last 
year. He needs to mind his own business." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams, who passed on quarterback Trent Dilfer to take tackle Wayne Gandy, 
will park Gandy on the bench Sunday. "We just feel at this time that we're 
trying to win a football game," Coach Chuck Knox said. "That doesn't mean we're 
totally giving up on the guy." T.J. SIMERS

PRO FOOTBALL / SEASON PREVIEWS; Q&A WITH RAM PRESIDENT JOHN SHAW; MOVE 'NOT A 
FOREGONE CONCLUSION' 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 One year from this very day -- Sept. 3, 1995 -- the NFL will open the regular 
season with the Baltimore Rams playing to a full house in Camden Yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Fact or fiction? 
</P>
<P>
 According to John Shaw, Ram president, not even he knows where the team will 
be a year from now. 
</P>
<P>
 "Do I believe the Rams are going to move?" Shaw said, repeating a question. 
"It's absolutely not a foregone conclusion, but it's a distinct possibility." 
</P>
<P>
 By the end of the month, Shaw will have met again in Los Angeles with Peter 
Angelos, majority owner of the Baltimore Orioles and the leader in the 
clubhouse in the battle over the Rams. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford, Conn., has submitted a serious proposal to the Rams, St. Louis is 
building a stadium and Anaheim refuses to surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 A financial analyst has been hired to tour the interested cities and verify 
promises and projections that have been submitted to the Rams. The paper work 
is piling up, the clock is running and team owner Georgia Frontiere is waiting 
for Shaw's recommendation. 
</P>
<P>
 A deal is all but in place with Angelos, who is acting on behalf of Baltimore, 
and it could be completed quickly, but Shaw said the team will wait to further 
explore Hartford and St. Louis, while also listening to Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 In a lengthy question-and-answer session with The Times recently, Shaw 
explained why this has become such a tedious task and detailed the options 
available to the Rams, including the sale of a minority interest in the team 
and the disadvantages accompanying each bid. 
</P>
<P>
 Question: Do you have a deal or an agreement in place to move the Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 Answer: We are not close to any deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Isn't it true, though, that you only have eyes for Baltimore? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I would say we're in a holding pattern with Baltimore because we haven't 
developed all the information on the other cities to the point we have with 
Baltimore. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But is Baltimore your No. 1 choice? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Baltimore stands willing to do a deal, and I feel if we wanted to proceed 
in that case we could proceed rapidly. We have opted not to at this point. We 
want to develop the other situations and make sure we have the best deal 
available before making a final decision. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What other cities remain real possibilities? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Hartford, St. Louis and Anaheim. Hartford has made a very serious proposal. 
It's a state of Connecticut deal and Gov. (Lowell) Weicker is very energetic 
and enthusiastic. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: But still, isn't Baltimore the front-runner? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There is no front-runner. All are very attractive cities that have talked 
about very attractive proposals. Each situation has tremendous advantages and 
certain disadvantages. None of the packages are such that we want to move 
there. Each one of them requires a great deal more work. 
</P>
<P>
 We have had extensive market analyses done in several of these cities and 
there is no doubt the Baltimore-Washington, D.C., marketplace is a very strong 
football marketplace. But there was also a study done for the league in 
1979-1980 that said Anaheim was the No. 1 expansion marketplace. Studies are 
studies, and there's still a lot of guesswork on which marketplace is best. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What are the disadvantages to moving to Baltimore? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Whether the Redskins are going to be in Laurel, Md., or not? What interim 
site would we use? Camden Yards or Memorial Stadium? And then how would the 
Canadian Football League lease impact that? Would we sell a minority interest? 
And that seems to be a larger element in this transaction. We would need all 
the assurances again that the bonding is in place and a new stadium can be 
built once this governor's term expires. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Let's go down the list: The disadvantages in Hartford? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Interim site. They are contemplating the Yale Bowl. How do we evaluate the 
marketplace, and the impact of two neighboring NFL teams, the (New England) 
Patriots and (New York) Giants? Can a new stadium be built and how long will it 
take? There are a whole bunch of issues in Hartford. We're looking at a state 
of Connecticut team, and so the marketplace is not so clearly defined. There's 
substantial homework to be done in Hartford. That situation presents a whole 
different approach. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: St. Louis? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The stadium lease is a big issue, a major issue. There is an indication 
they have been trying to deal with that, but we are no longer involved in 
discussions with St. Louis. If that lease is resolved, then I would say that 
becomes a viable situation. It has the advantage of having a stadium under 
construction. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Most people believe you have no interest in remaining in Anaheim or 
listening to Anaheim's efforts to keep the team. 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely not true. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What about Anaheim? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Anaheim is a little bit different because it never had the advantage of the 
head start these other cities have had. And Anaheim has been taking a lot of 
time to catch up. Obviously the issues in Anaheim are: Can they build a new 
stadium? Whether a renovated stadium suits our needs? Can the issues with the 
Angels -- two tenants in the same stadium -- be resolved? What can we do 
besides putting a better product on the field to create fan enthusiasm for the 
Rams? 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does Anaheim really have any chance of competing with Baltimore, St. Louis, 
Hartford? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Each one of the three other cities would economically be substantially 
better. The first year we would realize a substantial profit; we are projecting 
a $6-million loss this year here. 
</P>
<P>
 I've said we're trying to maximize our revenue, and so it's very difficult to 
compete with new stadiums that are being funded with public money. I always 
imagined that Anaheim would have a hard time being able to put itself in the 
position to compete with these other cities. But I'm totally open to any 
proposal that Anaheim might make. 
</P>
<P>
 We were extremely cautious to say when we gave notice that we were terminating 
our lease that this did not mean the club was necessarily moving. I think the 
fact we gave 15-month notice was misinterpreted as something greater than an 
expression of intent. I think people viewed it as a fait accompli once we gave 
notice, but I don't believe that's the case. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Has any other city in Southern California emerged as an alternative site to 
Anaheim? 
</P>
<P>
 A: The main thrust of the Southern California effort is coming from Anaheim. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: If the Rams move, they will have to pay off the remaining $30-million bond 
for Anaheim Stadium improvements. Will that be a problem in working out a deal 
elsewhere? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There's no thought to the paying of that money in a lump sum. It can be 
paid out over time, so it's not really a big issue. It's just one item on a 
long list of wishes. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Have you personally visited any of the cities you are currently 
considering? 
</P>
<P>
 A: No, and I presently have no plans to do so. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Does the death of Tampa owner Hugh Culverhouse and the prospect now of the 
Buccaneers moving have an impact on what the Rams are going to do? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's unclear at this time how that situation might impact us. We have to do 
what is best for us and move forward. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: How soon before this is all settled? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I would say there's a possibility it could be announced before the season's 
done, but as we speak I can tell you no announcement is imminent. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you look at the mid-February date required by NFL rules to give notice 
in order to play elsewhere in 1995 as the ultimate deadline? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's a deadline of sorts, but there is always the possibility of calling a 
special meeting if we did something later. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Will the sale of a minority share in the team be part of any deal? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Baltimore is interested in minority ownership. Anaheim basically told us 
that if it was a necessary element of the deal, they would try to accommodate 
us. It doesn't necessarily have to be an element of the deal. 
</P>
<P>
 Hartford is more like the Anaheim situation. If it had to be an element of the 
deal, they have an individual or number of individuals who would step up and be 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
 It's not really a contemplated element of the deal. Jerry Clinton and Stan 
Kroenke are interested in minority ownership in St. Louis, but those 
negotiations are separate with the city. If there was a sale of the ownership 
piece that would be done later. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: What's the next step? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We know where we are at in Baltimore. . . .  
</P>
<P>
 Q: Speaking of Baltimore, aren't you concerned that Washington Redskin owner 
Jack Kent Cooke will attempt to block a move to Baltimore? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I haven't focused so much on what is in his best interests. I'm much more 
focused on what's in Georgia's best interests. We've discussed what impact a 
team in Laurel might have on a team in Baltimore. That's obviously a factor on 
a potential move to Baltimore, a substantial factor to be honest with you. 
</P>
<P>
 It's obviously something we're trying to evaluate. It has much more to do with 
the ability of those two marketplaces to support two NFL teams than it has to 
do with the desires or wishes of the other owner. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Just what are you looking for? 
</P>
<P>
 A: We're looking for a new state-of-the-art football-only stadium that 
maximizes revenue to the football tenant. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: So that would leave Anaheim out? 
</P>
<P>
 A: A new football-only stadium is possible in the other three cities we have 
talked about. Anaheim is still operating under the significant disadvantage of 
not having public funds available to them. Anaheim is still proposing a 
renovated Anaheim Stadium. It's still unclear as to what the Angels would do. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Why is this process taking so long? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There are a lot of elements in the various leases for new stadiums, leases 
for interim sites, and there are the legalities of league approval that haven't 
been sorted out in each situation. We're reviewing the possibilities of 
litigation in the event we do not get league approval. We're not simply moving 
to a stadium. There are a number of problems related to such a move. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Just how bad are things in Anaheim, in your estimation? 
</P>
<P>
 A: There was a drop in attendance following our announcement that we were 
terminating our lease. But I would tell you that our ticket sales have 
decreased continually since the championship '89 season and decreased even 
before the announcement by roughly 40%. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you believe the problem is that Southern California cannot support two 
NFL teams? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I'm not making any such statement. I simply have been given the 
responsibility to maximize our club's revenue so that we can compete for 
players on the same basis as the other 29 clubs in the National Football 
League. I feel we can't compete next year with the two expansion franchises, 
which will have substantially more revenue than we have. We need to improve our 
financial situation in order to compete. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Attendance has dropped, but hasn't the product the Rams have put on the 
field the past few years been less than inspiring? 
</P>
<P>
 A: I would tell people, to the extent the front office is involved with the 
product on the field, we're trying desperately to improve it. We're spending 
the same dollars as every other club trying to improve it, and if we haven't 
succeeded in doing that, we will continue to try. 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Regarding money, there is talk around the league that you have the 
incentive to make this move happen because you will make big money as a result 
of it. Do you have such an agreement? 
</P>
<P>
 A: Absolutely no truth to it. I have no financial incentive. There is nothing 
in writing with ownership about me receiving money in the event we move." 
</P>
<P>
 Q: Do you understand the fans' reaction? Their frustration? Their feeling of 
helplessness? In some cases, their dislike for you? 
</P>
<P>
 A: It's my job to do the best thing for ownership, the best thing for the 
football team and make it competitive. I'm hopeful that our team would be 
competitive so our fans could really get into our team. I don't want to 
minimize the significance of the ultimate question of where the Rams will be, 
but I just think it's something that will work itself out in time. It's an 
important decision and I'm not going to make it hastily.

THE NFL / BILL PLASCHKE; IT APPEARS CHARGERS HAVE MEANS TO REPLACE BUTTS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL PLASCHKE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Natrone Means knew his life was about to change last winter when, upon 
returning to his house in tiny Harrisburg, N.C., he found a message waiting for 
him. 
</P>
<P>
 It was from Coach Bobby Ross of the San Diego Chargers. He was flying in from 
Indianapolis for the sole reason of meeting Means and his mother for dinner. 
</P>
<P>
 A few nights later, at a Charlotte hotel, the three held a discussion with 
ramifications that might be felt in the NFL for the next five months. 
</P>
<P>
 Ross wanted to know if Means was ready to become a star. 
</P>
<P>
 Means politely wondered what had taken Ross so long to call. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's time," Means said. "I'm ready to make my mark." 
</P>
<P>
 The San Diego Chargers are hoping that mark is visible on the chest and 
shoulders of defenders this fall as they give Means the opportunity to become 
the NFL's next great running back. 
</P>
<P>
 The second-year power rusher from North Carolina leads a long list of NFL 
players who could have breakout seasons simply because, under the new 
free-agency and salary-cap system, they will finally be given a chance. 
</P>
<P>
 Marion Butts, longtime Charger back, was traded to the New England Patriots 
this spring for salary reasons. 
</P>
<P>
 That instantly gave Means an opportunity to carry the ball as many as 25 times 
a game, considerably more than double last season's average of 10 carries a 
game. 
</P>
<P>
 By scoring five touchdowns in the Chargers' last three games, and gaining 118 
yards against the Miami Dolphins in a Monday night game, Means had already 
shown he deserved that chance. 
</P>
<P>
 "I went down to see Natrone and his mama because I wanted to let him know how 
we felt about him," said Ross, who visited Charlotte before the Butts trade and 
never mentioned the possibilities. "I wanted him to know we were hoping to get 
him the ball a little more this year. And we will. A lot more." 
</P>
<P>
 In one stretch of an exhibition game against the San Francisco 49ers' 
first-string defense, the 245-pound Means rumbled for five yards, danced for 
eight yards, bounced for two yards and bulled for four yards. 
</P>
<P>
 And that was all in the game's first five plays. 
</P>
<P>
 "My body can take the pounding; I've always gotten stronger as the game has 
gone along," said Means, who scored a team-leading eight touchdowns last season 
while rushing for 645 yards in 160 carries. 
</P>
<P>
 "I try not to take the lick, but dish it out," he added. "You see me getting 
hit, you'll always see three or four guys around." 
</P>
<P>
 There should also be a lot of people around these budding heroes this season: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Sean Dawkins, receiver, Indianapolis Colts: His nationally televised 
tongue-lashing by quarterback Jeff George last season is but a memory. He is no 
longer dropping passes and is suddenly making the Colts feel better about 
saving money by cutting their top two receivers, Reggie Langhorne and Jessie 
Hester. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Thomas Smith, cornerback, Buffalo Bills: A fifth consecutive Super Bowl 
appearance could rest on this second-year player's ability to fill the void 
left by Nate Odomes. Scouts say he is playing more than big enough. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Doug Brien, kicker, 49ers: Mike Cofer's absence has been embraced by this 
rookie third-round choice, the only kicker taken in the draft. Brien connected 
on five of his first six field-goal attempts in the exhibition season -- as if 
the 49ers needed another weapon. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Kevin Williams, receiver, Dallas Cowboys: He has improved so much from the 
scared rookie who fumbled everything last season, he could end up catching more 
big passes than Alvin Harper. "He has been one of the best things to happen to 
this team in training camp," fellow receiver Michael Irvin said. "He has turned 
everyone's heads." 
</P>
<P>
 -- Lamar Lathon, defensive end, Houston Oilers: This former linebacker has a 
new position, a new job (get the passer) and a new nickname: "RoboRush." Who 
gave it to him? He did, of course. 
</P>
<P>
 -- O.J. McDuffie, receiver and kick returner, Dolphins: As a rookie, he ranked 
second in the AFC in kick returns behind Raghib Ismail of the Raiders. This 
season, he'll be much busier as Dan Marino's No. 2 target after Irving Fryar. 
He could match his 19 catches of last season in the first month. THEY DON'T 
MAKE THEM LIKE THAT ANYMORE 
</P>
<P>
 Some tidbits from the NFL's 75th-Anniversary all-time team: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Mel Hein, a lineman with the New York Giants in 1931-45, was a starter on 
both offense and defense, yet did not miss a game in 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bronko Nagurski, a fullback, retired from the Chicago Bears for six years, 
then returned for the 1943 season to lead them to the championship. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Bob Lilly, a defensive tackle with the Cowboys in 1961-74, missed one game 
in 14 years. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Merlin Olsen, the former Ram star, played in the final 198 consecutive 
games of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Chuck Bednarik, a center and linebacker with the Philadelphia Eagles in 
1949-62, played 58 of 60 minutes in the 1960 NFL championship game. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Danny Fortmann, a guard with the Bears in 1936-43, started his first NFL 
game at 19. During his eight-year career, he also found time to earn a medical 
degree. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Ernie Nevers, a running back and defensive back for the Duluth Eskimos and 
Chicago Cardinals in the 1920s and early '30s, missed 26 minutes during the 
1926 season. 
</P>
<P>
 That 29-game season was 1,740 minutes long. I WOULD LIKE TO ORDER A PIZZA, TWO 
LARGE COKES AND A THIRD-DOWN PLAY 
</P>
<P>
 All you need to understand about the coach-to-quarterback radio can be 
explained by Matt Rodgers, then-quarterback of the Bills, who was asked about 
the device that will make its regular-season debut Sunday. 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in Suite 11 need more sausages," Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 What? 
</P>
<P>
 "The people in Suite 11 need more sausages," Rodgers said. 
</P>
<P>
 Rodgers was just repeating what he heard the first time he pulled on his 
radio-active helmet this summer. 
</P>
<P>
 Not that this was distracting, but he was later cut. 
</P>
<P>
 Harvey Shuhart, inventor of the gizmo, admitted that the food service vendors 
at Rich Stadium had accidentally pirated the game frequency on their 
walkie-talkies before a recent exhibition game. 
</P>
<P>
 "But I went to them before the game and got them to change, because the NFL 
has exclusive rights to certain frequencies," said Shuhart, president of 
Control Dynamics of Ivyland, Pa. IF YOU'RE ONLY LOOKING AT THE TWO-POINT 
CONVERSION, YOU'LL MISS THESE 
</P>
<P>
 Judging from the exhibition season, three of the most underpublicized new 
rules figure to have the biggest impact. 
</P>
<P>
 They are as follows: 
</P>
<P>
 -- Moving the kickoffs back five yards to the 30-yard line. 
</P>
<P>
 Every time we looked up, somebody was returning a kick to darn near midfield. 
</P>
<P>
 In their exhibition game with the Chargers, the average starting point of the 
nine drives by the 49ers was their 42-yard line. Talk about increasing offense. 
</P>
<P>
 This rule will make household names out of kick returners such as Robert 
Brooks of the Green Bay Packers and Mel Gray of the Detroit Lions. 
</P>
<P>
 Oh, so you think kickers will just knock the ball out of bounds? Only if they 
want their opponents to start on the 40-yard line, another new rule. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Allowing offensive linemen to line up approximately eight inches farther 
off the line of scrimmage than last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Tackles everywhere are saying that for the first time in their careers, they 
can hear the quarterbacks, see the defensive end and keep an eye on the ball at 
the same time. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've found that this one small thing is really going to improve the 
offense," said Jerry Seeman, the NFL's director of officiating. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Strictly enforcing the rule that prohibits the "chucking" of a receiver 
more than five yards from the line of scrimmage. 
</P>
<P>
 Not only are defensive backs playing more cautiously, but receivers have 
apparently decided that officials will now be too busy to watch them chuck the 
defenders. QUICK HITTERS 
</P>
<P>
 * NAME GAME: Dave Brown, the new quarterback of the New York Giants, has 
finally realized why he has gotten such little respect this summer. It's his 
name. 
</P>
<P>
 "Dave Brown is like John Doe," said Leigh Steinberg, his agent. "It's just not 
a quarterback's name. Not like Troy Aikman." 
</P>
<P>
 So together, Brown and Steinberg have initiated an informal contest to give 
Brown a better name. 
</P>
<P>
 "We may go the three-name route, like calling him David Allen Brown, or David 
Oscar Brown," Steinberg said. "Or maybe a prefix name, like Downtown Dave 
Brown." 
</P>
<P>
 Steinberg also counseled Brown that if a suitable nickname is not found and he 
is stuck with the same two-syllable moniker, it would not necessarily mean the 
end of his career. 
</P>
<P>
 Look at Steve Young. 
</P>
<P>
 * QUESTION OF THE WEEK: The morning after quarterback Drew Bledsoe of the New 
England Patriots was hospitalized with a stomach ailment earlier this week, the 
media's first question of Coach Bill Parcells was, "Did you give him an ulcer?" 
</P>
<P>
 * CHARTER MEMBER OF TERRY McDANIEL FAN CLUB: Jerry Rice, who needs three 
touchdowns to pass Jim Brown and become the NFL's all-time touchdown leader, 
could conceivably set the record in Anaheim during the 49ers' third game. 
</P>
<P>
 That would be fitting, considering he has scored 11 of his 124 touchdowns 
against the Rams. They are second on his hit list behind the Atlanta Falcons, 
who have allowed 20 of Rice's touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 There is only one team he has not scored against during the regular season or 
postseason in his nine years. He will have another chance Monday night at 
Candlestick Park, because that team is the Raiders. 
</P>
<P>
 * NOW DO YOU BELIEVE US? Those who still think Miami's Dan Marino will be as 
good as ever Sunday should listen to fellow quarterback Warren Moon, who met 
with Marino after the Dolphins played an exhibition game with Moon's Minnesota 
Vikings. 
</P>
<P>
 "I talked to him after the game," Moon told reporters. "He's still not real 
confident in planting on his Achilles' (tendon). It's more than the calf muscle 
now, really. For him to plant right now is psychologically very tough because 
I'm sure he has in the back of his mind, it might pop again. It's just 
something he has to get over." 
</P>
<P>
 Two of Marino's teammates have already said that it might be best if Bernie 
Kosar started Sunday against the New England Patriots. 
</P>
<P>
 * WAYNE'S WORLD: Coach Wayne Fontes of the Detroit Lions, that noted clone of 
Bill Walsh, said he gave quarterback Scott Mitchell special instructions at the 
beginning of the regular season: "Touchdowns. Score touchdowns."

SAMPRAS SAILS, COURIER SINKS; TENNIS: TOP-RANKED PLAYER BEATS VACEK IN STRAIGHT 
SETS. NO. 11 PLAYER LOSES TO GAUDENZI. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL DWYRE, TIMES SPORTS EDITOR

<TEXT>
<P>
 Life on the men's tennis tour continues to be an ocean liner for Pete Sampras 
and an iceberg for Jim Courier. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras, the No. 1 player in the world and the No. 1-seeded men's player here, 
floated through his second-round match on Stadium Court Friday night at the 
U.S. Open, beating Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic, 6-3, 6-4, 6-4. 
</P>
<P>
 Sampras was supposed to be a bit suspect coming into this tournament, not 
having played since July 17 because of an ankle injury. But he played Vacek in 
the second round here last year, with a sound ankle, and lost a set. So 
Sampras' easy ride Friday night was simply more bad news for future opponents, 
none of whom look the least bit formidable at this stage, because the earliest 
he can face a seeded player now is the semifinals. 
</P>
<P>
 "The long layover, maybe that's working to my advantage now," Sampras said. 
"I'm especially fresh mentally. If anything, I'm excited to get out there and 
play." 
</P>
<P>
 If anything, Courier is not. He came up on the tour about the same time as 
Sampras and got to be No. 1 before Sampras did. But Friday afternoon, he 
crashed and sank on the Stadium court. His opponent, Andrea Gaudenzi of Italy, 
who won, 7-5, 6-2, 3-6, 6-3, had heretofore distinguished himself by climbing 
into an umpire's chair in a recent tournament, while opponent Goran Ivanisevic 
took a bathroom break, and announcing to the crowd: "Game, Set, Match, 
Gaudenzi." 
</P>
<P>
 So Courier, down to No. 12 in the world and seeded No. 11 here, has now been 
reduced to losing to comedians, hardly a laughing matter for such a serious 
player. 
</P>
<P>
 At 24, Courier remains a player of stature, with four Grand Slam titles and a 
spot in the final here in 1991. But the last year or so has been a struggle, 
and Courier even threatened to quit the tour permanently, or perhaps 
indefinitely, after a loss a few weeks ago in Indianapolis to well-known Alex 
Corretja of Spain. Courier looked good in a straight-set victory over Aaron 
Krickstein on Tuesday night, but he clearly wasn't hitting on all cylinders 
against Gaudenzi, even though he fought hard and saved six match points before 
succumbing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'm disappointed with the result, but pleased with the effort," Courier said. 
Tennis Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Besides Jim Courier, the only other upset victim on the men's side was No. 8 
Andrei Medvedev of Ukraine, a 6-3, 6-2, 6-3 victim of Karel Novacek of the 
Czech Republic. . . . Seeded men Michael Stich of Germany (4), Stefan Edberg of 
Sweden (5) and Yevgeny Kafelnikov of Russia advanced, as did former USC player 
Byron Black of Zimbabwe and one of last year's finalists, Cedric Pioline of 
France. . . . Besides the losses of Conchita Martinez (3) and Mary Joe 
Fernandez (9), Arantxa Sanchez Vicario of Spain (2), Kimiko Date of Japan (5) 
and Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina (8) won in straight sets. 
</P>
<P>
 Friday night's crowd was a near packed house of 20,565, and there was divided 
opinion as to how many came to see yet another Pete Sampras rout and how many 
came to see New York's current favorite clown act/doubles team, the Jensen 
brothers, who played after Sampras. . . . Sampras' news conference got through 
the sore ankle stuff and the how-well-can-you-really-play questions quickly, 
and progressed to important new information, such as that Sampras, at 6 feet 1, 
used to be able to dunk a basketball but hasn't tried it for a while, and that 
he can hit a golf ball 300 yards with regularity, "But then I can never find 
it."

GROSSMAN WINS, RELEASES PAIN; TENNIS: AFTER UPSETTING FERNANDEZ, SHE TELLS OF 
HER LATE FATHER'S OVERLY STRICT TRAINING ON OHIO FARM. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 It's a long way from a concrete court in a barn in Ohio to a victory over the 
ninth-seeded player in the third round of the U.S. Open, but Ann Grossman made 
that leap here Friday. And when she was finished, she took the occasion to 
purge herself of a few demons. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman, from Grove City, Ohio, upset Mary Joe Fernandez, 6-4, 6-4. 
Fernandez, fighting back from recent abdominal surgery, had struggled to get 
past Patty Fendick in the second round and simply couldn't cope with Grossman's 
speed and strength. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman has been on a roll this summer, getting her ranking up to No. 36 with 
impressive performances that included a victory over Martina Navratilova in 
Manhattan Beach and a run all the way to the final of that tournament, before 
losing to Amy Frazier. 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman, who lived for a while in the South Bay area of Los Angeles and still 
trains there frequently, had told reporters during the Manhattan Beach 
tournament a little about her days growing up on the farm in Ohio, where her 
father, Bill, pushed her to train and play and excel. She joked then about 
hitting the ball between the cows and the pigs. 
</P>
<P>
 But Friday, after her emotional triumph here, she was equally emotional and 
surprisingly candid while expanding on her late father and the deep effect he 
had on her. 
</P>
<P>
 "I lost my dad three years ago," she said. "And he was really hard on me. I 
used to go out on the court and if I missed one shot, I would freak out. . . . 
I really did hate myself when I was growing up because tennis was everything to 
my dad, and if I won, it was great and if I didn't, I was, like, nothing. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now, I've gone back and gotten the anger out from my dad, and for me, he did 
so much. . . . I wouldn't be here if he didn't push me. They have to push, but 
they have to know when to stop, and that's difficult for a parent and it's kind 
of scary. 
</P>
<P>
 "When I have a kid, it's going to be tough, but -- so what I've done is gotten 
out of a lot of anger, so when I go on the court, all those bad memories don't 
come back to haunt me. 
</P>
<P>
 "And now, I'm free." 
</P>
<P>
 Grossman said that her father believed in her working on the tennis court six 
hours a day, that he "abused" her verbally all the time, but that he simply 
didn't know another way. 
</P>
<P>
 And what would her father have said if he had been here Friday? 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know," she said. "He's watching right now . . . he probably wouldn't 
know what to say." BILL DWYRE

 There was no significant movement on Day 22 of the strike by major league 
baseball players, but the union prepared to charge owners with unfair labor 
practice early next week, sources said Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The grievance, to be filed with the National Labor Relations Board, stems from 
the owners' refusal to make a $7.8-million payment from All-Star game receipts 
to the players' pension fund.The payment was due Aug. 1, but the owners have 
maintained that they were not obligated to make it because the pension 
agreement had expired and no new terms were in place. 
</P>
<P>
 Although union officials would not comment, a source said the union would ask 
the NLRB to order owners to make the payment, with interest. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the source, it is unlikely that the union will also file a 
default claim that could make all players free agents, but that decision has 
not been made. 
</P>
<P>
 In what would be a separate action, Gene Orza, the union's associate general 
counsel, said grievances would be filed on behalf of the 16 players whose 
salaries have been terminated through minor league recalls since Aug. 4. 
</P>
<P>
 Orza said default notices might be filed on behalf of many of the 16, a 
process that could make them free agents, and that defaults will definitely be 
filed for Pittsburgh pitcher Randy Tomlin and Texas infielder Jeff Huson. 
</P>
<P>
 Baseball arbitrator George Nicolau would rule on those grievances. ROSS NEWHAN

DODGER FRONT OFFICE IS HIT WITH CUTBACKS; BASEBALL: TEAM ANNOUNCES PAY 
REDUCTIONS FOR EMPLOYEES AND WARNS OF POSSIBLE LAYOFFS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 The Dodgers, believing that not even a sudden resolution of the baseball 
strike would enable them to offset financial losses, announced pay cuts for 
their front-office employees Friday and warned them of possible layoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Dodger officials said at a staff meeting that there will be a 15% pay cut for 
25 management personnel, effective last Thursday, and a 10% pay cut for 75 
non-management personnel, effective Sept. 12. As partial compensation for the 
cuts, employees will work a four-day week. 
</P>
<P>
 "What this says is that regardless of whether the season resumes or not, our 
club, along with the rest, has been negatively impacted," said Bob Graziano, 
Dodger vice president/finance. "That picture isn't going to change. 
</P>
<P>
 "In our opinion, even if there were to be a postseason, the economic benefit 
of that has been drastically reduced." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers won't determine when employees will again receive full pay until a 
new Basic Agreement is implemented, Graziano said. He also said employees 55 
and older may be eligible for an early retirement program. 
</P>
<P>
 "We are contemplating layoffs," Graziano said, "but we're presently reviewing 
the entire organization. We'll go on a department-by-department basis before 
implementing any layoffs and then make a decision at that point in time. 
</P>
<P>
 "What we're trying to do is react to the current situation. If the picture 
worsens, then we'll react to that." 
</P>
<P>
 The Dodgers have yet to make any cutbacks in their scouting and development 
departments, according to Fred Claire, executive vice president, but layoffs 
are under consideration. 
</P>
<P>
 "As far as anything immediate (goes), the answer is no (regarding layoffs)," 
Claire said. "But evaluations will be made in the upcoming weeks." 
</P>
<P>
 The Angels, who have already laid off three full-time employees, will wait at 
least two weeks before announcing further plans. 
</P>
<P>
 "If Sept. 15 comes and goes and the season is lost," Angel President Richard 
Brown said, "then we'll have to go to stage two. We already have a plan, but 
I'm hopeful we won't have to use all or part of that plan." 
</P>
<P>
 The Texas Rangers, who became the first team to announce pay cuts for their 
front-office staff, have delayed any pay reductions until Oct. 1. Employees 
will receive a 10% cut on that date, a 15% cut on Nov. 1 and a 20% cut on Dec. 
1, according to John Blake, club vice president. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minnesota Twins will vote Tuesday on whether to make immediate layoffs or 
impose a mandatory one-week non-paid vacation that must be taken by Oct. 9.

LOS ALAMITOS; GOOD TIME, BAD POST FOR REALLY A SECRET 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Really A Secret, the fastest qualifier for tonight's $62,000 Gold Rush Derby 
at Los Alamitos, got the worst post for the 870-yard race. 
</P>
<P>
 Owned by Linda May Williams and trained by Dennis Givens, the 3-year-old drew 
the outside in the field of eight, meaning he figures to get caught wide. 
</P>
<P>
 Two of the other main contenders, Citation Five and Oh Oh The Signature, are 
directly inside Really A Secret. Thoroughbreds L.C. Tern and Tis A Little Doll, 
and Chicks Response, the three slowest qualifiers in the Gold Rush Derby trials 
on Aug. 19, drew the inside three posts. 
</P>
<P>
 Citation Five, beaten by a nose at 3-10 in his trial, is the most accomplished 
in the field. He has five victories in 17 starts and earnings of $61,097. 
</P>
<P>
 Two races later, Bein Cold Cash, who has four victories in six starts for 
trainer Blane Schvaneveldt, heads a field of 10 2-year-olds in the $12,000 
Santa Barbara Overnight Handicap at 350 yards.

DEL MAR; DEAD HEAT IN SUNDAY'S FEATURE WOULD SUIT TRAINER SAHADI FINE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVE DISTEL, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Jenine Sahadi had been around thoroughbred racehorses all of her life. She had 
a degree from USC in journalism and seven years' experience doing assorted 
tasks at Hollywood Park. Her life had direction, but it lacked specific 
purpose. 
</P>
<P>
 Horse racing, obviously, would be her career, but others controlled it. 
</P>
<P>
 Sahadi's solution was to cast her lot with the horses themselves. She would 
train them. 
</P>
<P>
 In the 16 months since Sahadi, 31, took out her training license, her horses 
have already earned close to $2.5 million. 
</P>
<P>
 Her key? 
</P>
<P>
 "You've got to put them where they can win," she said. "They know when they're 
getting beaten." 
</P>
<P>
 Sahadi has two horses placed where they have an opportunity to win -- in 
Sunday's $250,000 Del Mar Handicap. In fact, Grand Flotilla and Sir Mark Sykes 
will start side by side in the first and second positions in the 1 3/8-mile 
race on the turf. 
</P>
<P>
 They will give their trainer an opportunity to experience one of the joys of 
training. 
</P>
<P>
 "The easiest part of training is the walk down to the winner's circle to get 
your picture taken," she said, laughing. "There's nothing like winning. The 
horses know it too. No doubt about it. They know it for days." 
</P>
<P>
 Why, then, put one of her two in position where he can't win -- barring a dead 
heat? 
</P>
<P>
 Grand Flotilla is a homebody who does not like to travel. Sir Mark Sykes is a 
jet-setter with nowhere to go. 
</P>
<P>
 "It takes forever just to get Grand Flotilla into a van," Sahadi said. 
"Nothing bothers Sir Mark Sykes, but there's nothing really around (elsewhere) 
for him now and this race is a good distance for him." 
</P>
<P>
 Both horses are owned by Mike Sloan, general counsel for Circus Circus. He and 
his wife, Mary Louise, helped the trainer get started in her adopted career. "I 
wanted to do it properly if I was going to do it," Sahadi said. "I didn't want 
to start with one or two horses because I knew I wouldn't get anywhere like 
that. I wanted to make sure I had horses before I got a license. With their 
horses and mine, now I had a barn." 
</P>
<P>
 Sahadi has owned thoroughbreds since she was in high school. Her father 
founded the Cardiff Stud Farm and her brother, Stephen, now runs it. The 
facility is located near San Luis Obispo in Creston, which happens to be the 
name of a Sahadi-trained colt who won last year's Balboa Stakes here. Indeed, 
when Sahadi started training, the first horse she sent to the post, La 
Sarcelle, won an allowance race at Hollywood Park on May 2, 1993. She was also 
successful with Kalita Melody, and Megan's Interco set a course record in the 
Shoemaker Handicap at Hollywood Park. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Grand Flotilla has delivered the biggest victories for her. He won 
the $500,000 Hollywood Turf Handicap on May 30 and came back to win the Sunset 
Handicap on July 24. He has not run here yet this year, but Sir Mark Sykes won 
the Escondido Handicap on Aug. 10. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year has been incredible," Sahadi said. "I've always been lucky and I 
know I'm fortunate to have some really nice horses, but a lot of people train 
horses for 30 years and don't get a horse like Grand Flotilla." 
</P>
<P>
 But there is another side to training. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every day there's bad news at the barn," Sahadi said. "I've got 34 horses 
over there and every day I get to the barn and find out somebody's not eating 
right or somebody's not feeling well or somebody's got a bad ankle." 
</P>
<P>
 But that's not the worst of it. 
</P>
<P>
 "The worst thing," she said, "is telling a guy his horse can't run. Maybe he's 
bred it and he's proud of it and looking forward to the races and you've got to 
tell him his horse can't be competitive." 
</P>
<P>
 In two summers at Del Mar, Sahadi has been as competitive as anyone on the 
backstretch. Close to 30% of her entries have won and 50% have run first or 
second. Come Sunday, her ambition is to finish first and second. Horse Racing 
Notes 
</P>
<P>
 Blaze O'Brien, ridden by Chris McCarron, caught 3-5 favorite Rapan Boy at the 
wire and won the $55,000 How Now Handicap by a nose Friday. . . . Trainer Brian 
Mayberry, suspended for 30 days Thursday because of a positive drug test on one 
of his horses, will appeal the decision. He maintains that a veterinarian's 
mistake caused the positive tests and called the "trainer's responsibility" 
rule archaic. According to that rule, the trainer is responsible for all that 
goes on in his barn. 
</P>
<P>
 Call Now, ridden by Alex Solis, is favored in today's $250,000 Del Mar 
Debutante for 2-year-old fillies. . . . Eliza, the champion 2-year-old filly in 
1992, will make her first start in almost 15 months in the June Darling 
Handicap earlier on the card. She has been plagued by minor problems, according 
to trainer Alex Hassinger.  
</P>
<P>
 Venus In Spurs beat Incognito by 1 1/4 lengths to win the $30,000 Signor 
Corron Handicap for Illinois-bred 2-years-olds at Arlington International 
Racecourse. Venus In Spurs, ridden by Mark Guidry, finished the six-furlong 
race in 1:11 and paid $7.40, $4.40 and $2.80. Incognito returned $26.80 and 
$7.20 and Holy Matrimony paid $3.00.

CARUTHERS SLOWED BY A BAD BREAK; FOOTBALL: USC LINEBACKER WILL MISS FIRST TWO 
GAMES OF THE SEASON AFTER INJURING FOOT IN PRESEASON PRACTICE. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF WONG, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The timing of it all is almost enough to make Gerald Caruthers crack a smile. 
But the pain in his left foot stops him every time. 
</P>
<P>
 The upcoming season was his for the taking. The 6-foot-3, 235-pound senior 
linebacker entered USC's preseason camp tied for No. 1 on the depth chart after 
starting five games at the position in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
 But while high-stepping through conditioning drills one week before the start 
of preseason practice, Caruthers suffered a broken left foot, keeping him out 
of action until the Trojans' Sept. 24 game against Baylor. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's definitely bad timing," said Caruthers, who graduated from Saugus High. 
</P>
<P>
 The injury doesn't have Caruthers worried, though, and why should it? His life 
has featured enough danger and excitement to put a Tom Clancy novel to shame. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1978, he and his family moved from their native Oklahoma to Israel. When 
they returned to the United States almost eight years later, the one link he 
had with American culture was sports, particularly football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I always wanted to come back and play football," he said. "It was one of the 
reasons I wanted to come home." 
</P>
<P>
 Life in Oklahoma was much different than the volatile climate of the Middle 
East, where terrorists and violence were just another fact of life. 
</P>
<P>
 The Caruthers family lived on a "moshav," a private farming community in the 
Negev Desert just 12 miles from the Egyptian border. 
</P>
<P>
 "I did a lot of work with my dad, spraying and picking and planting," 
Caruthers said. "My father worked hard, worked a lot, like any farmer does." 
</P>
<P>
 But few American farmers worked in similar circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
 A decade after the Six-Day War with Egypt in 1967, guards with automatic 
rifles slung over their shoulders stood watch as Caruthers and other children 
attended school. 
</P>
<P>
 "There were always terrorists," Caruthers said. "It was like a constant 
threat. It was almost a day-to-day thing. We'd go to school and there would be 
an armed guard all the time. 
</P>
<P>
 "And the army would check out the school in the morning to make sure there 
were no bombs. I guess you got used to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Israel requires all citizens to serve at least three years in its armed 
forces. The process begins when children turn 14, with weapons training. The 
first year of service starts by their 18th birthday. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruthers never got the chance to serve. After tomato prices dropped 
dramatically in two consecutive years, the family no longer could support 
itself and returned to the United States. 
</P>
<P>
 Israel, though, still remains close to Caruthers' heart. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not America -- let's face it," he said. "It makes me appreciate the 
things that I have now, the freedoms people have, the good life. 
</P>
<P>
 "I'd like to go back there. I grew up there and have a lot of love for the 
country, like if you grew up in America you'll love America because it's your 
country." 
</P>
<P>
 And in America, they played football. Caruthers spent his freshman and 
sophomore years at a high school in Oklahoma, where he ran cross-country and 
track, but didn't play football. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was kind of a rail," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 After his sophomore year, his family moved to the San Fernando Valley. He 
played two years at Saugus High and was named All-Golden League in 1989. But 
playing for losing teams resulted in little notice. 
</P>
<P>
 He received scholarship offers from Cal State Northridge and Cal State 
Fullerton, but chose instead to attend Pasadena City College. 
</P>
<P>
 Caruthers blossomed at Pasadena. As a sophomore in 1991, he was named a J.C. 
All-American by Blue Chip magazine and first-team All-State Region IV by the 
J.C. Athletic Bureau. 
</P>
<P>
 USC offered him a scholarship following that breakthrough season. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was around a lot of good players," he said. "I was in the weight room a lot 
because in high school I really didn't work out that much, and I had good 
coaches." 
</P>
<P>
 As a junior transfer last season, Caruthers started five mid-season games and 
had 22 tackles. 
</P>
<P>
 "He works extremely hard and he came back in great shape," USC defensive 
coordinator Don Lindsey said. "He's really well-conditioned. I hate not having 
him for the first two ball games. 
</P>
<P>
 "When he comes back, we expect him to step right on in behind Brian Williams." 
</P>
<P>
 The prospect of having to catch up to Williams for that starting position 
rankles Caruthers, but he has little choice. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was really looking forward to this year," he said. "I was that much more 
confident, I had experience. It's a bummer that this happened, but I'm trying 
to have a positive attitude and in a few weeks we'll work from there."

O.C. POP MUSIC REVIEW; MIDLER'S SPONTANEOUS COMBUSTION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE BOEHM, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In a concert season of tailored star vehicles, Bette Midler's production, 
"Experience the Divine," stands out for its sense of spontaneity. 
</P>
<P>
 Barbra Streisand presented a seamless, "Masterpiece Theatre" biopic, a 
self-celebratory ritual enacted with exacting taste upon an exquisite stage set 
complete with tea service. 
</P>
<P>
 Janet Jackson contrived an entertainment for the MTV generation, flashy, fast 
moving, big on mechanical wizardry, revealing of cleavage and bellybutton but 
drawing a blank when it came to fleshing out the person inside the flesh. 
</P>
<P>
 Midler's concert, her first touring package since the early 1980s, was less a 
piece of modern entertainment machinery than a throwback to vaudeville -- a 
more immediate, less distancing brand of performance. 
</P>
<P>
 It was, in fact, a highly crafted, well-rehearsed theatrical apparently little 
changed from the show she first took out a year ago. But Midler's act made 
imbalance and jarring juxtaposition the rule and gave the impression that 
anything at all might pop out at any moment. 
</P>
<P>
 The formerly fleshy, formerly redheaded singer, now slimmed-down and topped by 
a pile-up of blond curls, aptly likened herself to a CD player set on 
"shuffle." 
</P>
<P>
 Much of the pleasure of the two-hour, 15-minute show at Irvine Meadows stemmed 
from the surprising nature of what popped out. 
</P>
<P>
 Where else are you going to see mermaids making like Rockettes while riding in 
motorized wheelchairs, then dancing on fishtails-for-feet, as did Midler and 
her three singing sidekicks, the Harlettes? 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 What comedian is going to give you up-to-the-minute one-liner dispatches on 
(and dispatchings of) the latest celebrity doings ("CNN chasing DNA . . . 
figure skating as a contact sport"), but also incorporate a long re-creation of 
Sophie Tucker's bawdy, burlesque-house comedy? 
</P>
<P>
 Who would dream of singing a witty, lightheartedly boastful rap number about 
herself, then zip right into a swinging, breezy Cole Porter song, "Miss Otis 
Regrets," about a society lady's lynching? Another sudden shift found Midler 
delivering a long stand-up comedy sequence, then turning without warning to an 
aching ballad. 
</P>
<P>
 Watching her, one thought of the days of vaudeville and TV variety shows, when 
the comedian preceded the torch singer, who was followed by the animal act and 
the ventriloquist, all linked by a single principle: the eagerness to 
entertain. 
</P>
<P>
 Tellingly, Midler did not employ the video screens used nowadays by most other 
big-ticket acts, but placed justified confidence in her ability to project a 
personality big enough to reach to the lawn (a sparsely populated lawn; Midler 
drew perhaps 11,000 fans to the 15,000-capacity amphitheater). 
</P>
<P>
 The show was full of gimmicks (including some cleverly risque body painting, 
as Midler decorated the torsos of female dancers clad only in G-strings and 
pasties), but it was refreshing that they were gimmicks of the traditional 
stage and not of the video age. 
</P>
<P>
 The show's overall zestfulness made it possible to forgive this vision of the 
Divine when it erred. Despite its delightful bits, the mermaid routine, which 
has been in her act for years, went on far too long and was built around a 
pointless scenario in which Midler's character, Delores DeLago, presided over 
the sort of self-help seminar seen on late-night, paid-programming TV. 
</P>
<P>
 The concert's first half was strong on comedy and ended with Midler's bang-up 
re-creation of "Rose's Turn," a show-stopper from the Broadway musical "Gypsy." 
But it also was strewn with tossed-off ballads, including a pallid version of 
"The Rose" (Midler sang this weeper with a smile on her face, suggesting that 
she is either heartily sick of the song, or that she wasn't joking when she 
talked about spending 20 years on Prozac). 
</P>
<P>
 After the mermaid epic that opened the second act, Midler stuck to some 
signature ballads. "Do You Want to Dance?" suffered without the sultry, dreamy 
intimacy she brought to the version on her career-launching album, "The Divine 
Miss M." 
</P>
<P>
 Midler was effective when she could find a dramatic angle to emphasize, a 
character to play, as she did on "Hello in There," a flinty John Prine lament 
depicting old age as the worn-out nub of life. 
</P>
<P>
 But her voice doesn't have a rich blend of hues, and it sounded harsh as she 
proclaimed "From a Distance" or overdid the belting on "Stay With Me," an 
anguished, R & B-flavored torch song from "The Rose." Part of that harshness 
may have been in the sound mix, but it also had to do with the one-dimensional 
timbre of Midler's voice. 
</P>
<P>
 Midler has updated some of the topical references in her show from when she 
first took it to the road last year. There were references to the Simpson and 
Harding-Kerrigan sagas, to the Jackson-Presley nuptials ("I'm worried about 
Lisa Marie Presley; I don't think she knows why they call it Neverland"), and 
several quips and barbs about Orange County, where Midler, who owns a house in 
Laguna Beach, is a sometime resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Hip-shooting spontaneity has its risks. Some rather unfunny attempts at Jewish 
ethnic humor (she's no Jackie Mason) led to the subject of the Streisand tour: 
"I wish I'd brought my carpet like that other Jewish girl singer." To which 
somebody called out "princess," a term now taken as a slur by most Jews. One of 
the Harlettes asked Midler who said it. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some racist I'm sure," she answered. "You know how they are down here." 
Midler quickly said she was joking, but good humor is specific, and there's not 
much funny in broadly labeling a community as racist. Midler must have realized 
that, because a moment later, softening her typically sassy edge, she 
announced, "Orange County's been very, very good to me." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Midler will have a harder time making amends for her ticket prices. Face 
prices were $102.50 for orchestra, $52.50 for loge and $32.50 for terrace 
seating, for an average price of about $53. 
</P>
<P>
 She jokingly referred to the high-rollers down front as "Yuppie swine." But 
charging an average of more than $50 a seat makes Midler (who probably grossed 
more than $500,000 for her evening's work) -- and the even more pricey Eagles 
and Barbra Streisand -- the Marie Antoinettes of their generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Pop music has been a real part of America's social glue, but overpriced 
concerts are becoming an exercise in class division. Fans of small or average 
means are either excluded or extorted. 
</P>
<P>
 From up close at $102.50, or from a distance at $32.50, inflated price 
structures are raw displays of unfettered ego that deny the populist ideal of 
classlessness proclaimed in Midler's hit. A concert industry willing to play 
Marie Antoinette has already lost its head; if this keeps up, it deserves to 
lose its customers.

COLLEGE RADIO IS DIVERSE, NOT ELITIST 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 I did not attend the UC Irvine Offspring show on Aug. 20 reviewed by Mike 
Boehm ("What Price Glory for Offspring?," Calendar, Aug. 22) but I have been, 
as he has, thinking quite a bit lately about the status of so-called "punk" and 
whether it hasn't completely been turned into a commodity. But what really set 
me off was Mr. Boehm's remarks about "narrow-minded, contemptibly clubby 
college rock tastemakers, who will repudiate good music for the sole reason 
that it can be appreciated by more than a small coterie of the superior elite." 
</P>
<P>
 The purpose of college rock programming is not to "repudiate good music." Nor 
is college rock out to "out-punk" or "out-alternative" anybody. It strives to 
give exposure to artists not represented by the mainstream stations. With 
"alternative" and "punk" rock such a commodity these days, college radio is 
forced by its very nature to look even further underground. I think the 
Offspring are good at what they do, and since what they do is (finally) being 
recognized now, it simply is no longer college radio's place to give them 
exposure when it could be giving it to someone who is unheard of because of 
lack of advertising or label support (or even a label). We played the Offspring 
when no one else would; now they get played everywhere. We need to keep moving. 
</P>
<P>
 As for the comment that the deejays are "narrow-minded," I challenge Mr. Boehm 
to listen to a day of college radio and tell us that it isn't more diverse, 
more accepting of different musical styles and genres than any commercial 
station on the dial. College and public radio are incredible resources and 
assets to any community, ones more people should take advantage of and support, 
not slag on.

</P>
<P>
 After reading Mike Boehm's dissertation on the Offspring's performance at UCI, 
I thought "here we go again, let's pick on a band that makes a hit record." The 
Offspring isn't the first and won't be the last band to embrace punk ideals, 
kick out a driving sound and subsequently become successful. Artists make music 
for creative purposes, then along comes MTV, continuous airplay and critics 
screaming "sellout!" 
</P>
<P>
 Nirvana's Kurt Cobain hardly looked like a scary punk front man. Even with his 
tattered sweaters and nappy blond hair, he had the same boyish, blue-eyed 
all-American good looks as the Offspring's Bryan Holland. However, both 
understood/understand the Angst, disillusionment and anger of their generation. 
</P>
<P>
 Although parts of Orange County are "the epitome of suburbia," there 
definitely is a thriving music scene here. Like Nirvana and Seattle, the 
Offspring is just the first to really break out and make The Industry take 
notice. And when the feeding frenzy really begins, some will praise the 
Offspring for bringing attention to a long-neglected home of musical talent 
while others will blame them for exploiting and commercializing it. 
</P>
<P>
 Let's be hopeful that if Bryan Holland gets fed up, he'll return to USC, 
finish his Ph.D. research in microbiology and live happily ever after, while 
Kurt rests in peace.

MUSIC REVIEW; GRIMAUD PLAYS SCHUMANN WITH S.F. SYMPHONY AT BOWL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIEL CARIAGA, TIMES MUSIC WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Adequate performances of Robert Schumann's Piano Concerto are a regular part 
of every musical season, winter and summer. Memorable ones occur seldom. 
</P>
<P>
 Helene Grimaud, the highly gifted pianist from Aix-en-Provence, gave an 
acceptable reading to the familiar showpiece on her return to Hollywood Bowl, 
Thursday night in the third and final program of the current visit by San 
Francisco Symphony. She failed to define the work's style, however, or to probe 
its lyricism, or to lift its songfulness above the mundane. 
</P>
<P>
 One needn't go back to the heydays of Myra Hess and Guiomar Novaes in the 
1940s and '50s to name a role model on which Grimaud might have based her 
approach to this work. In 1987, the late Malcolm Frager gave what seemed a 
definitive reading of Schumann's masterpiece of 1841, exploring its dichotomy 
of command and reticence, glowing passion and reserved rhetoric. 
</P>
<P>
 Before an audience recorded at 9,073 on Thursday, Grimaud simply played 
through the piece, observing its sensibility without caressing its details, 
proving solid rather than fluent in expressing its extended lines, regular 
rather than persuasive stating its rhythms. No sense of breathlessness informed 
the opening movement; the Intermezzo clomped along, and the finale emerged 
effortful rather than buoyant. Charm stayed away. 
</P>
<P>
 For all the fine accomplishments of Music Director Herbert Blomstedt and his 
San Francisco ensemble, this team avoided any compelling playing on this 
occasion. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, the opening work on the program, Grieg's suite, "From Holberg's Time," 
revealed admirable mechanical achievement and a disciplined tone-palette in the 
orchestra's strings. Genuine transparency would seem still to be in the future. 
</P>
<P>
 What was missing in Blomstedt's efficient but clearly articulated reading of 
Mussorgsky-Ravel's "Pictures at an Exhibition" -- musicological revisionists 
have now declared the at to be better as a from -- seemed to be imagination, 
the connection of thoughts to sounds and the projection of both to an 
interested audience. Playing the notes carefully is never enough.

O.C. PUNK SCENE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 First, I want to thank Mike Boehm for being a good spokesman for the O.C. punk 
scene and for the article "A Compilation Should Be Our Next Offspring" (Aug. 
18) recommending an O.C. punk compilation. 
</P>
<P>
 There are a few historical inaccuracies in the article that I would like to 
correct. 
</P>
<P>
 1) O.C.'s first punk airplay on KROQ was in January of 1978 when Rodney 
Bingenheimer played the Mechanics' version of Jan & Dean's "Dead Man's Curve," 
done Ramones-esque. 
</P>
<P>
 2) The O.C. punk scene began "shouting" in 1973-74 when the bands Head Over 
Heels and the Strand were playing Iggy & the Stooges and New York Dolls songs, 
and their own punk originals. Head Over Heels was the first in O.C. to do a 
punk version of Dick Dale's "Miserlou," in 1973. Agent Orange did it later, in 
1978 or '79. Members of Head Over Heels and the Strand later surfaced in such 
bands as the Mechanics, the Avengers, D.I. and 16 Tons. 
</P>
<P>
 3) The Mechanics were not influenced by Devo but by Iggy, the Ramones, the 
Weirdos and the Sex Pistols. 
</P>
<P>
 TIM RACCA 
</P>

</P>
<P>
 Racca was guitarist with the Mechanics from 1977-81 and currently is a member 
of 16 Tons.

ORIGINAL WOODSTOCK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 It seems to me that all the pundits who should know better are missing the 
point of Woodstock. The point is that the original one was a dreadful 
screw-up.Not that I was at the original one (thank God), but from what I've 
read the primitive facilities were completely overwhelmed by the unexpectedly 
large number of people who showed up. 
</P>
<P>
 Those people didn't mind the squalor; in retrospect they seemed to relish it, 
because they were young and they were treated to music their parents hated, and 
that seemed to make it all worthwhile. 
</P>
<P>
 The music was different back then. Jimi Hendrix's version of our national 
anthem must have seemed superbly ironic with the term "race music" still 
hanging like smoke in the air and with our country involved in a controversial 
and unpopular war. Yet 25 years later this tune is not revolutionary at all. It 
was used in a TV commercial by a big company. 
</P>
<P>
 The original Woodstock probably was intended only as a money-making scheme, 
but it also was history-making. Woodstock 2 seems to be dominated by complete 
cynicism.

TV REVIEWS; EXAMINING COMPLEX ISSUES OF FEAR, VIOLENCE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ROBERT KOEHLER, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 While crime inundates KNBC-TV Channel 4's local news hours, the station in all 
its wisdom programs useful shows like "Growing Up Scared" and "Victory Over 
Violence" at the wonderfully convenient hours of noon and 7 p.m. on a Saturday. 
</P>
<P>
 In "Growing Up Scared," about ways for parents to help their kids contend with 
violence, host Teri Garr forever reminisces about her innocent childhood, but 
hers is a selective memory: The '60s were hardly a placid, safe time for a lot 
of kids. 
</P>
<P>
 Still, they didn't have to see random gun violence, mass murders, reports of 
child abduction and their drug-addicted parents sacrifice them to the streets. 
A panel of concerned adults -- Mark Klaas, father of abduction victim Polly 
Klaas; Omega Boys Club co-founder Joe Marshall; inner city pediatrician Dr. 
Joseph Kramer, psychologist Dr. Sarah Stein and "Children Now" founder Jim 
Steyer -- talk in snippets about key issues, including the lures of gangs and 
the effects of certain kinds of TV on kids (the selected targets here are 
"Beavis and Butt-head," "Ren & Stimpy" and Henry Rollins videos on MTV). 
</P>
<P>
 The useless sections include a vapid report on white gang members in 
Davenport, Iowa. The useful bits, however, include parental checklists on 
talking to strangers, TV-watching habits and communication. 
</P>
<P>
 While "Growing Up Scared" raises several complex issues without the 
examination they deserve, the four-part "Victory Over Violence" simply reports 
on apparently successful methods attacking violent crime in America -- many of 
them having nothing to do with building more prisons or turning neighborhoods 
into occupied zones. 
</P>
<P>
 At least, you hope they're working. Hosted by TV's living Mt. Rushmore, Walter 
Cronkite, "Victory Over Violence" glibly hops from one terrific crime-stopping 
program to another while never explaining why they're not being adopted 
elsewhere in the country. 
</P>
<P>
 Whether it is a South Carolina juvenile offenders program, a Texas 
incarceration center and school for teen criminals with innovative therapy 
methods, or a Tacoma, Wash., paper printing at-large criminals' mug shots, 
they're reportedly getting results. A Queens, N.Y., rape conviction program is 
putting rapists behind bars at a rate 27% ahead of the rest of the United 
States. So why is it still unique to Queens? 
</P>
<P>
 The solutions here are always partial, but each of them is essential. The 
dynamic juvenile court judge Leodis Harris, for instance, makes bad kids in his 
court feel shame, apologize to their victim and parents and say "sir" a lot, 
while he forces parents -- both of them -- to take responsibility. He issues 
such court orders as directing a wayward father to take his son fishing on a 
regular basis. 
</P>
<P>
 A country full of Judge Harrises is a wonderful idea that would be irrelevant 
if we had a country full of parents doing their job. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Growing Up Scared" airs at noon today, and Part 1 of "Victory Over 
Violence" airs at 7 tonight (and continues Saturdays through Sept. 24) on 
KNBC-TV Channel 4.

TV REVIEWS; 'ASSAULT ON THE MALE' PROBES MUTATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 We're not about to rank the BBC Horizon production "Assault on the Male" up 
there with Rachel Carson's and Murray Bookchin's prophetic examinations of 
chemical contamination of the environment. But writer-producer Deborah 
Cadbury's film is an extremely important document on how scientists have 
discovered a partial cause for sex mutations and declining sperm counts in male 
humans and animals. 
</P>
<P>
 The key scientist-detective here is Dr. Richard Sharpe of Edinburgh's 
Reproductive Biology Unit. His studies in recent years on young male sex 
deformities (testicular cancer alone, he notes, has tripled in the United 
States and England in 30 years) brought him into contact with Copenhagen 
University Hospital Prof. Niels Skakkebaek, who had accidentally discovered a 
disturbing 50-year trend in declining human sperm counts. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe found that the crucial cell in sperm production was the Sertoli cell, 
which can be degenerated by estrogen. 
</P>
<P>
 Sharpe then found something more: Scientists in different pursuits were 
unwittingly putting together the elements to solve a riddle: Is postwar 
industry producing substances that can actually reverse a male animal's sex, 
and what does estrogen have to do with it? 
</P>
<P>
 Estrogen-rich cow's milk used in baby formulas was ruled out, though diet was 
not, because it can't be scientifically tested. Other researchers interviewed 
found that chemicals such as DES and DDE directly caused the kind of sex 
mutations starkly visible among alligators on Florida's Lake Apopka. Tufts 
University biologist Ana Soto -- again, by chance -- discovered that the common 
chemical compound nonyl phenol in her lab's test tubes was mutating sperm 
samples. 
</P>
<P>
 In fact, industrial and consumer waste product is, in Sharpe's words, "a sea 
of estrogen." 
</P>
<P>
 "Assault on the Male" doesn't suggest that men should worry if they or their 
male offspring will become hermaphrodites, or that modern industrial society 
should be shut down. But, within the framework of an engrossing story of how 
scientists stumble in the dark toward discoveries, it explicitly argues that 
current generations are guinea pigs in an environment awash in compounds whose 
total effects are unnervingly unknown. 
</P>
<P>
 * "Assault on the Male" airs at 7 p.m. Sunday on the Discovery Channel.

<P>
 About twice a month, gynecologist Maria Picarde says yes, but this time when a 
young woman in her cramped office made the request, the doctor shook her head 
no. 
</P>
<P>
 The woman, 18, wanted to be sterilized. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterilization is illegal in Brazil, except in life-threatening circumstances; 
punishment for the offending physician can be up to two years in prison. But 
like thousands of other doctors in Brazil, Picarde has done hundreds of such 
procedures in her 17 years of practice.

 "She was just too young," Picarde said. "You have to consider everything, the 
big picture -- housing, finance, education, age. I had a case of a poor woman, 
about 37, with four children who was pregnant again. She was married, and they 
couldn't afford the children she had, so I said yes. But this (18-year-old) 
woman, she just didn't understand the gravity of the decision." 
</P>
<P>
 Unfortunately, officials say, not all physicians are so thoughtful. The 
combination of physician insensitivity and greed, patient ignorance and the 
cost of contraceptives has made illegal sterilization the primary form of birth 
control in Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials estimate that in the state of Maranhao, 76% of women of 
reproductive age have been sterilized, in Goias, 72%, in Pernambuco, 60%. 
</P>
<P>
 Brazil's Congress is considering legislation to reduce sterilization -- by 
making it legal. 
</P>
<P>
 Legislation has passed the House of Representatives and is awaiting a vote in 
the Senate, but it will face stiff opposition from the Roman Catholic Church in 
a country with the world's largest Catholic population. 
</P>
<P>
 The bill would make sterilization available upon request, imposing a 60-day 
waiting period during which the woman would be told about contraception. 
</P>
<P>
 Congressman Eduardo Jorge Martins Alves Sobrinho, who introduced the 
legislation, said he and various women's organizations hope that will spur 
women to choose non-permanent forms of birth control. 
</P>
<P>
 "You would be creating a mechanism to protect the population from . . . mass 
sterilization," Sobrinho said. 
</P>
<P>
 A month's worth of contraceptives can cost $6 for pills or $30 for condoms, in 
a country where half of all workers earn less than $120 a month. 
</P>
<P>
 Sterilization is so widely practiced that many recipients, officials admit, 
don't realize it is illegal. Some local governments even promote sterilization. 
</P>
<P>
 Several towns in Parana, a southern state, offer free tubal ligations for poor 
women with more than five children. Chagas Alves, a gynecologist and state 
legislator in the northeastern city of Cascavel, has admitted sterilizing 750 
poor women in the past 15 years. And during election years, politicians offer 
to help women get sterilizations in exchange for votes. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody knows, but nobody sees," said one nurse. 
</P>
<P>
 To both cover their tracks and increase fees, doctors perform sterilizations 
during Cesarean childbirths. Brazil has the world's highest rate of Cesarean 
deliveries, in part, some speculate, because of sterilizations. 
</P>
<P>
 "Doctors claim the Cesarean is necessary because of health risks," said Rita 
Bagaini, planning director of the Civil Society of Family Welfare, a private 
health organization. "Then they can charge (the federal health service) twice 
the rate of a normal delivery, and the woman pays for the tubal ligation."

COASTAL WREN WON'T BE PUT ON ENDANGERED SPECIES LIST; WILDLIFE: THE DECISION 
ANGERS MANY CONSERVATIONISTS. HOWEVER, THERE IS DISAGREEMENT AMONG 
ORNITHOLOGISTS ON WHETHER THE BIRDS ARE A TRUE SUBSPECIES. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

<P>
 Citing disagreement within the scientific community about the coastal cactus 
wren and whether it is a unique subspecies, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service 
decided Friday not to put the songbird on the endangered species list. 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials released a report containing the findings of several 
ornithologists who said the bird found primarily in Southern California coastal 
sage scrub is similar to other subspecies of wrens found in large numbers in 
Baja California and throughout the Southwest. 
</P>
<P>
 Experts estimate there are 2,000 pairs of coastal wren living in Orange, 
Riverside, San Bernardino and San Diego counties. The Fish and Wildlife 
Service's decision not to include the coastal wren on the endangered species 
list was also made easier by the refusal of the influential American 
Ornithologists' Union to recognize the bird as a separate subspecies. 
</P>
<P>
 Most observers viewed the agency's ruling as a victory for developers. 
However, both builders and scientists said the decision will have little impact 
on the wrens found in Southern California because most of them live alongside 
the California gnatcatcher, which is already protected as an endangered 
species. 
</P>
<P>
 Dawn McCormick, a spokeswoman for the Irvine Co., Orange County's largest 
private landowner, said the Fish and Wildlife Service's ruling, while welcomed, 
"does not really impact us a whole lot." 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. played an influential role in the creation of state's Natural 
Communities Conservation Planning program in 1991, which encourages landowners 
to voluntarily set aside habitat for the gnatcatcher and other rare plants and 
animals. The program calls for "comprehensive habitat planning that deals with 
habitat as a whole rather than individual species," said McCormick. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're treating the gnatcatcher and cactus wren all the same as part of the 
(planning) process," said McCormick. "We're treating the cactus wren as if it 
was on the (endangered species) list." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 However, some scientists criticized the Fish and Wildlife Service's action and 
blasted the American Ornithologists' Union's refusal to recognize the coastal 
wren as a subspecies. 
</P>
<P>
 "The AOU's recognition of the gnatcatcher as a distinct subspecies and their 
rejection of the cactus wren seems in opposition to the decision I would expect 
from them," said Dennis Murphy, director of the Center for Conservation Biology 
at Stanford University. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials at the American Ornithologists' Union in Washington could not be 
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
 Murphy, who was the chief author of the conservation guidelines for the 
state's conservation planning program, also expressed disappointment over the 
refusal by federal wildlife officials to recognize the coastal wren as a 
distinct and endangered species. 
</P>
<P>
 "This coastal population of wren is one of the most distinct subspecies you're 
ever going to find," he said. "I assure you that if you gave me a box full of 
coastal wrens and inland wrens, I could separate every last one of them." 
</P>
<P>
 The coastal wren is about eight inches long, with black and buff feathers 
spotted with dark splotches. The bird's distinctive sound is a staccato 
churring that experts describe as unharmonious and even annoying. 
</P>
<P>
 But Fish and Wildlife Service spokesman Richard Zembal said there is still not 
enough scientific evidence available to list the coastal wren as a separate 
subspecies. 
</P>
<P>
 "There is nothing unique about the Southern California wren. . . . They are 
common in many kinds of habitats all over the southwestern United States," said 
Zembal. "The question is one of distinctness. We just can't say that the 
Southern California cactus wren is a unique population." 
</P>
<P>
 Other kinds of cactus wrens, which are non-migratory, are found throughout the 
Southwest, from Texas to California and south to Mexico. The bird makes its 
home in the cholla and prickly pear cactus, about three feet off the ground. 
</P>
<P>
 Amadeo Rea, a San Diego ornithologist who led the effort to put the coastal 
wren on the endangered species list, said the songbird has a call different 
from the other wrens. 
</P>
<P>
 "Anyone can see there is a difference unless they're blind in both eyes," said 
Rea. "The desert and coastal birds sound different. There are also obvious 
physical differences between the continental and coastal birds." 
</P>
<P>
 However, Rea acknowledged that the coastal and Baja California birds have 
similar characteristics. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 The Fish and Wildlife Service's report also said that the coastal wren's 
numbers in Southern California are declining as "coastal sage scrub habitats 
are becoming increasingly depleted" and encouraged the conservation of the 
bird's shrinking habitat. 
</P>
<P>
 Kimball Garrett, ornithology collection manager at the Los Angeles County 
Museum of Natural History, said the bird should be listed as an endangered 
species because "it's losing its habitat." 
</P>
<P>
 "They've got to look at this as a habitat issue too," Garrett said. "Unless 
the (coastal) wren is listed as an endangered species, we will have no viable 
means of habitat protection. And if the bird's habitat can't be protected, we 
can't protect the bird."

STEPPING UP THE WATCH; HOLIDAY BOATERS WHO AREN'T SHIPSHAPE COULD BE CATCH OF 
THE DAY

 Anaheim resident John Elliott was on his 36-foot yacht "Love Is" on a recent 
sunny afternoon, cruising with some Florida guests to Catalina Island for the 
Labor Day weekend. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Then alongside the yacht came a U. S. Coast Guard boat carrying Petty Officer 
James Antonelli, a boarding officer with the authority to inspect any boat he 
wants, any time he wants, to see that it's being operated safely. 
</P>
<P>
 Elliott, an experienced boater, passed the inspection, receiving only warnings 
to buy new flares and have his 9-year-old passenger wear a life jacket while on 
the upper deck. 
</P>
<P>
 That inspection scene will be repeated hundreds of times in Orange County over 
the next three days as the Coast Guard and the Orange County Sheriff's Harbor 
Patrol keep a vigilant eye on the thousands of partyers, fishermen and skiers 
who will cool off and celebrate Labor Day by hitting the water. 
</P>
<P>
 Harbor Patrol deputies and Coast Guard crews will also be on the lookout for 
people who are operating their boats while intoxicated, which since 1988 has 
been a federal offense punishable by up to one year in prison and a $5,000 
fine. 
</P>
<P>
 In California, boat operators with a blood-alcohol level of .08% are 
considered drunk -- as are the drivers of cars. Since January, the Coast Guard 
has stopped 44 people in California for boating while intoxicated. 
</P>
<P>
 They will also be intercepting boats that have too many people and not enough 
life jackets, and those whose engines have fuel leaks that could send the boat 
up in flames with a single spark. 
</P>
<P>
 "If it weren't for stupidity, we would be unemployed," said Antonelli, as he 
recalled accidents caused by inexperienced and alcohol-impaired boat operators. 
</P>
<P>
 "The message of boat safety cannot be oversold," added Petty Officer Dennis 
Hall, a Coast Guard spokesman. "The most important thing you can tell someone 
is to wear a life jacket, or at least keep it near you. And know how to use 
it." 
</P>
<P>
 According to the California Department of Boating and Waterways, one person 
was killed in Orange County boating accidents in 1992 and 1993. The 28 boating 
accidents that happened in the county in those two years also resulted in 10 
injuries and $434,000 in property damage. 
</P>
<P>
 Boat operators do not need a special license to pilot a boat, nor is there any 
age requirement for operators. 
</P>
<P>
 Those factors make for dangerous conditions on the water during crowded 
holiday weekends, when many boat operators and passengers are busy celebrating 
and not watching the movements of other boats, Hall said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's just like driving a car. You have to pay attention to what the other 
guy's doing because you never know what he's going to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 One in 10 boating accidents in California in 1992 and 1993 involved boat 
operators younger than 18. Personal watercraft (often called by the trade name 
Jet Ski) account for a third of the state's boating accidents even though 
constitute only 11% of all registered sea vessels. 
</P>
<P>
 The percentage of motorboat fatalities involving alcohol actually has 
decreased in the last 10 years, declining from 59% in 1984 and 1985 to 33% in 
1993.  
</P>
<P>
 But with no law against open containers of alcohol on boats, many operators 
and passengers still imbibe while on night cruises around local bays, Antonelli 
said. Boats also stop along restaurant-dotted shorelines, where drivers and 
passengers may have too much to drink. When drunk, drivers are unable to judge 
distances between boats, and passengers become dizzy and risk falling off the 
deck and drowning. 
</P>
<P>
 One of the most notorious boating accidents in Orange County was 
alcohol-related. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1984, five people were killed when a boat piloted by Virl Earles ran into 
an unlighted buoy in Anaheim Bay off Seal Beach. Earles, who survived along 
with three passengers, was found to be drunk at the time of the accident and 
convicted of involuntary manslaughter. 
</P>
<P>
 Sheriff's Lt. Dick Olson said the boating public has become more aware of the 
danger of mixing drinking and boating since that time, but that boaters still 
need to pay more attention to general boating safety rules, such as having 
working flares, and checking fuel lines and batteries before embarking. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've got pretty heads-up boaters here in Orange County," Olson said. "But 
even one 'boating under the influence' accident is one too many." Drinking and 
Boating 
</P>
<P>
 Every year, the Orange County Harbor Patrol arrests a handful of people for 
boating while intoxicated. Suspected drunk boat operators face the same field 
sobriety tests and jail penalties as drunk auto drivers. (Other figures in the 
chart are total incidents, not just those involving boating while intoxicated.)

PONY EXPRESS: A STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE; HISTORY: WITH HIS FIVE-MONTH TREK, JOE 
NARDONE OF LAGUNA HILLS BECOMES FIRST TO WALK NEARLY 2,000-MILE FAMED ROUTE IN 
ITS ENTIRETY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 By his account, Laguna Hills historian Joe Nardone logged nearly 2,000 miles, 
15 blisters and five rattlesnake encounters in the five months it took him to 
walk from St. Joseph, Mo., to San Francisco, retracing the fabled Pony Express 
trail. 
</P>
<P>
 On Friday, the 53-year-old retired real estate agent became the first person 
to walk the trail in its entirety, according to the Sacramento-based Pony 
Express Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 "Now that it's done, I feel relieved," he said Friday before boarding the 
Oakland ferry that would transport him to the final five blocks leading him to 
the Montgomery and Merchant streets terminus of the historic trail. 
</P>
<P>
 "I have so much to do that I'm glad this journey is over so I can get to it." 
</P>
<P>
 Nardone started his adventure on April 3 at the former Pony Express 
headquarters in St. Joseph, Mo., where the trail and the short-lived business 
had started 134 years ago that day. 
</P>
<P>
 From there, he walked the length of the trail that riders on horseback used to 
deliver mail from April, 1860, to November, 1861. 
</P>
<P>
 Nardone said he has been fortunate to have the time and freedom to pursue his 
dream. 
</P>
<P>
 In 1971, he moved from Chicago to Costa Mesa and later to Laguna Hills. At 
first, he operated a flight school at what is now John Wayne Airport and, in 
1976, switched to selling residential real estate.  
</P>
<P>
 When Nardone, a bachelor, retired in 1982, "I could do pretty much what I 
wanted to do," which meant devoting himself to study of the Pony Express trail. 
"I was really lucky." 
</P>
<P>
 On his most recent trek, he was backed up by a one friend in a van, walking an 
average 20 miles per day through rain and snow, crossing creeks by canoe and 
bays by ferry. Along the way, he put monuments at six station sites and gave 28 
lectures on the trail's history. 
</P>
<P>
 The story of the Pony Express has been greatly embellished over the years, 
like a lot of Western history, Nardone said in a telephone interview from 
Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
 As with the modern Federal Express, the aim of the company was to take 
high-end delivery from the U.S. Postal Service, which had contracted to a stage 
coach company, the Overland Mail Co. Delivery of a letter on the Pony Express 
cost $5 per half ounce, the equivalent of $80 in today's dollars, Nardone said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I doubt there were very many love letters at that price," Nardone said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Most of the company's customers were wealthy business correspondents and news 
organizations, he said. The Japanese government used the service to send 
messages that arrived by sea in San Francisco to their embassy in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
 And while the service lasted less than two years, it was never expected to 
survive completion of the transcontinental telegraph or, nearly a decade later, 
the transcontinental railroad. 
</P>
<P>
 The fabled speed of delivery -- 10 days from St. Joseph to San Francisco -- 
was only reached six times, he said. The average was 12 days. To achieve that 
mark, riders probably moved at a lope, rather than a gallop, Hollywood versions 
notwithstanding. 
</P>
<P>
 "They were not not really going that 'hellbent for leather,' " Nardone said. 
"They did get the mail through, and their tenacity in doing that was 
outstanding." 
</P>
<P>
 Similarly, the movie version of riding into the stations and practically 
jumping from a tired mount to a fresh one "wasn't really done much of the 
time," he said. "More likely, they came into the station for a bite to eat." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite its danger, there were few reported deaths among the riders, whose 
average age was 22. One was killed during a war with Native Americans; another 
froze to death in a Nebraska snowstorm. 
</P>
<P>
 Now that Nardone's trek is over, he doesn't plan to take a break from his 
obsession with the trail and its history. He said he plans to return to Orange 
County next week, where the first thing he will do is sit down at his computer 
to complete a wall map and book about the trail that he has been working on for 
years. 
</P>
<P>
 Nardone's fascination with the West and its history goes back to his 
childhood. His father was a history professor, but he preferred to see historic 
sites himself, rather than reading about them, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 He decided to do an in-depth study of the Pony Express trail 11 years ago when 
he realized that books and pamphlets on its history were full of undocumented 
and romanticized information.  
</P>
<P>
 "I love to be able to dig and do research," he said. "I found a bunch of 
errors." 
</P>
<P>
 Another of the misconceptions that he wanted to clear up is the actual end 
point of the trail. 
</P>
<P>
 Many historians say the trail began in St. Joseph and ended in Sacramento, 
where riders put the mail on a ferry to San Francisco. Nardone contends it 
actually ended in San Francisco, because on 19 occasions, the riders missed the 
ferry and completed the route on horseback. 
</P>
<P>
 That is just one piece of controversial information he said he has uncovered 
during more than 22,500 hours of research on the route, the riders and the 
schedules. He has scrutinized aerial maps and newspaper clippings and even rode 
the length on horseback in 1991 and traveled it once by car in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
 Nardone said he knows it "like the back of my hand," and next year plans to 
lead a small car caravan. 
</P>
<P>
 Nardone acknowledges his single-mindedness about the topic is unusual. He 
tells the story about an encounter with a farmer in Kansas who, after chatting 
politely for a few moments on the way, cut to the question foremost in his 
mind. 
</P>
<P>
 "So, don't you have anything better to do with your time?" the farmer asked. 
</P>
<P>
 Nardone replied that he was one of those rare people in this world who have 
the courage to pursue their dreams, no matter how strange. That, alone, made it 
worthwhile, he reasoned. 
</P>
<P>
 Besides, he added, "I wanted the credibility of being more than an armchair 
historian. I wanted to go out there to get the sense of the trail, the feel. 
For that, it worked."

ATHLETE INJURED IN MOB ATTACK CHANGES SCHOOLS

 Citing the potential for problems with classmates, the parents of a black 
youth who was severely beaten during an attack in Portola Hills have pulled him 
out of Santa Margarita High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Melvin Aaron, the father of 15-year-old Ruben Charles Vaughan III, said his 
son enrolled at Foothill High School in Santa Ana last week because of concerns 
that some students at Santa Margarita High may have played a role in the Aug. 5 
attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "We feel, given the situation and what occurred, it would be foolhardy to put 
him back in that environment," said Aaron, a professor at Cal State Long Beach. 
"We would like to believe this was a random incident, but there are some clear 
indications of premeditation in this." 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughn, a varsity football player, plans to play football at Foothill, where 
he will start his sophomore year. 
</P>
<P>
 The 15-year-old Tustin youth suffered a broken jaw, nose and several stab 
wounds in an attack described by Laguna Niguel Municipal Judge Pamela L. Iles 
as "one of the most vicious I've seen in a long time." The attack, which Iles 
said should be prosecuted as a hate crime, left Vaughan hospitalized for three 
days. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities said Vaughan and three other Santa Margarita High School students 
were attacked by 20 to 30 youths, most of them from the Lake Forest area, 
looking for a "flyer party" that never materialized. 
</P>
<P>
 The three friends escaped, while Vaughan faced the group alone, according to 
investigators. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron said he was concerned that his son has enemies at Santa Margarita High 
School who helped set him up to be beaten. 
</P>
<P>
 "He had a great number of friends there, but apparently he had some who 
disliked him," Aaron said. "It only takes a few for something like this to 
happen." 
</P>
<P>
 Two men have been charged in the beating. Derek Thomas Jones, 20, of 
Huntington Beach has been charged with assault with a deadly weapon, causing 
great bodily injury and attempting to influence a witness. 
</P>
<P>
 Russell T. Scarce, 19, of Lake Forest is charged with causing great bodily 
injury, assault with a deadly weapon and assault on a minor. 
</P>
<P>
 Both men are being held in Orange County Jail on $100,000 bail. They are to 
appear in Orange County Superior Court on the charges on Sept. 12. 
</P>
<P>
 A 16-year-old Lake Forest youth also has been arrested in the attack. 
</P>
<P>
 After reviewing the evidence, the Orange County district attorney's office 
decided Aug. 25 not to prosecute the attack as a hate crime. But Deputy Dist. 
Atty. Bruce Patterson said Friday that his office was reconsidering the 
decision in light of Judge Iles' comments. 
</P>
<P>
 Aaron said his son's transfer had nothing to do with the football program at 
private Santa Margarita High School in Rancho Santa Margarita, where Vaughan 
played as a freshman last year. 
</P>
<P>
 "Ruben had a very good relationship with (Santa Margarita) Coach Jim 
Hartigan," Aaron said. 
</P>
<P>
 Vaughan will play football for Foothill and has participated in light drills 
during the past week. He is expected to be in uniform when Foothill opens the 
season Friday night against rival Tustin High.

 "He's cleared" to play, Foothill Coach Tom Meiss said. "But we're going to 
take it slow with him. Everything is fine except a metal plate in his jaw. His 
body seems to be OK. We just want to make sure he doesn't get his jaw hit." 
</P>
<P>
 "He's been on a special workout program but he's not going to go full tilt 
yet," Aaron said. "He's lost about 20 pounds. And his jaw isn't fully healed 
yet." 
</P>
<P>
 Meiss said Vaughan will play tight end and linebacker at Foothill. He isn't 
expected to play until the Knights meet Newport Harbor on Sept. 16.

CITY'S MEXICAN INDEPENDENCE EVENT CANCELED; FESTIVAL: SANTA ANA'S ANNUAL 
CROWD-PLEASING CELEBRATION COULDN'T ATTRACT ENOUGH SPONSORS TO MAKE IT A 
SUCCESS THIS SEPT. 16, ORGANIZERS SAY. 
</P>

<P>
 Organizers on Friday abruptly canceled the city's annual Mexican Independence 
Day celebration, saying they could not secure the corporate sponsors needed to 
fund the popular parade and festival. 
</P>
<P>
 The announcement stunned fans of the event, which attracted 250,000 people to 
downtown Santa Ana last year and was telecast to millions on Spanish-language 
television. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials from the Downtown Santa Ana Business Assn., which has sponsored the 
celebration for a decade, said some longtime corporate sponsors decided to 
sever their association with the event after violence broke out at a Cinco de 
Mayo festival in Los Angeles earlier this year. 
</P>
<P>
 About 18 people suffered mostly minor injuries in that May 1 event when youths 
began throwing rocks and bottles. 
</P>
<P>
 "We had trouble finding sponsors," said Julie Nungaray, who works at the 
business association. She said they weren't eager to sponsor the event, as they 
had been "in past years." 
</P>
<P>
 Nungaray said some sponsors were concerned that problems might break out at 
the festival, even though the event has never attracted trouble. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've never had violence here on any level," said business association member 
Michael Macres, who owns Macres Florists on Broadway. "We have a good crowd." 
</P>
<P>
 The Los Angeles Cinco de Mayo disturbances forced the cancellation in May of 
the Orange County Mariachi Festival. Organizers said some corporate sponsors 
pulled their support after the Los Angeles violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's sad to see this happen," said Becky Esparza, a member of the county 
Human Relations Commission, who has attended several festivals commemorating 
Mexico's Independence Day each year on Sept. 16. "It's always been very 
peaceful, with lots of children and families. . . . It gives people a chance to 
enjoy each others' cultures." 
</P>
<P>
 The cost of producing the Santa Ana festival is at least $100,000, Macres 
said. About $75,000 of that usually comes from corporate sponsors. The 
remainder is generated from booth rentals and parking, carnival and soda 
revenue. 
</P>
<P>
 Last year's event had more than 42 corporate sponsors, including R.J. 
Reynolds, Pepsi and Kimberly Clark. Business association officials did not 
disclose which sponsors declined to be involved in the 1994 event. 
</P>
<P>
 "It seemed like nobody wanted to spend any money this time," said Macres, 
noting that some corporations used all their sponsorship funds on the World 
Cup. 
</P>
<P>
 The business association has spent the last few months searching for ways to 
save the Sept. 16 festival, which has suffered a series of setbacks. 
</P>
<P>
 In May, the promoter who had successfully produced the last two festivals 
decided to pull out and move his business out of state, according to an 
association statement released Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 The association's board of directors attempted to produce the event with the 
help of local Spanish-language media specialists. But finding sponsors proved 
difficult. By July, only about a fourth of last year's sponsors had expressed 
an interest in the 1994 festival. 
</P>
<P>
 So the board this week was faced with the choice of either producing a 
dramatically scaled-down festival or canceling it. They decided to give the 
festival a "one-year hiatus" and bring it back in 1995, saidRoger Kooi, 
administrative director of the association, in a statement released Friday to 
groups and businesses that had planned to be involved. 
</P>
<P>
 Had the event been presented this year, "it would have been too small -- it 
wouldn't have been like before," Macres said. "We'll take a year off and hit it 
hard next year." 
</P>
<P>
 Besides the lack of corporate sponsors, festival organizers also found booth 
preregistrations to be significantly down from last year.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ORANGE; CROWDING REPORTED AT EAST-SIDE SCHOOLS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Elementary schools in Orange Unified School District's east side have reached 
maximum capacity and are threatening to overflow, school officials said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's overcrowded," Assistant Supt.Arthur J. Townley said. 
</P>
<P>
 The problem is growth in the area and lack of schools, said officials, who 
added that local pupils living outside Orange Unified may have to be 
transferred back to their home districts. 
</P>
<P>
 At Imperial Elementary School in Anaheim, for example, parents of 12 pupils 
have been told that their children may have to leave.  
</P>
<P>
 Most of them have been at Imperial for at least two years and some as long as 
four, Principal Marnie Frasure said. 
</P>
<P>
 "Of course, they don't want to leave any more than we want to lose those 
children," said Frasure, who has been fielding calls from parents all week. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance at Imperial has jumped from 535 to 640 this past year alone. Most 
teachers have 30 pupils in each class, but some have as many as 33, Frasure 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The elementary schools in that region are year-round, a situation that makes 
it difficult for some children to pick up their studies midway through a school 
year. The year began July 25, and the first quarter will end Sept. 26. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials will take a final count Sept. 12 and then decide if anyone has to be 
bumped. "We won't know until we see the whites of their eyes," Townley said. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that construction of new schools is unlikely because, voters having 
failed to support a state bond measure in June, a local bond issue is unlikely 
to succeed. 
</P>
<P>
 The worst-case scenario would involve busing children from the east side to 
other schools in the district. "That's not very palatable," he added. LESLEY 
WRIGHT

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: STANTON; STORE FIRE DAMAGE PUT AT $1 MILLION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A four-alarm fire erupted in a discount store before dawn Friday, gutting the 
50,000-square-foot brick building and causing $1 million in damage before 
firefighters could put the blaze out. 
</P>
<P>
 About 100 firefighters and 20 vehicles from the Orange County, Anaheim and 
Buena Park fire departments responded to the fire at the 99 Only store, which 
was reported at 3:34 a.m., said Orange County Fire Department spokesman Dan 
Young. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said the fire at 11400 Beach Blvd. was brought under control in one hour 
and 45 minutes. There were no injuries, he said.  
</P>
<P>
 In fighting the fire from the street, firefighters had to dodge exploding 
aerosol cans -- including cans of hair spray and paint -- that burst like fiery 
rockets through the windows, Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 By Friday evening, the Orange County Fire Department was still trying to 
identify the owner of the building and determine the cause of the fire, which 
was one of the largest in the county this year.  
</P>
<P>
 The building was leased by 99 and More Inc., which operates discount stores, 
Young said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because the Stanton Building Department had condemned the structure, Young 
said, the department's bomb squad and arson investigators were being kept out 
until the walls could be removed.  
</P>
<P>
 When investigators are let in Tuesday, he said, they will be accompanied by a 
dog that is specially trained to sniff for gasoline. 
</P>
<P>
 Young said that the spread of the fire could have been prevented. 
</P>
<P>
 "If there had been sprinklers, the fire would have been held in check and we 
would have been notified (by an automatic alarm) as soon as the water flowed," 
he said. LESLIE BERKMAN

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: GARDEN GROVE; FIREFIGHTERS WARN AGAINST SOLICITATIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
 For the second time this year, city firefighters have warned residents to be 
wary of telephone solicitors using the Fire Department to seek donations for 
disabled firefighters. 
</P>
<P>
 Capt. Bill Dumas issued the warning this week because of what he said were 
increasing complaints from people who are upset about the solicitations. 
</P>
<P>
 Dumas said that the calls are apparently being made by employees of Garden 
Grove-based United Liberty Productions on behalf of the Foundation for Disabled 
Firefighters, a nonprofit organization. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're soliciting using our name," said Dumas. 
</P>
<P>
 He said that neither United Liberty Productions nor the Foundation for 
Disabled Firefighters is authorized to solicit donations on behalf of the 
Garden Grove Fire Department or the Garden Grove Firefighters Assn. 
</P>
<P>
 But Cynthia Wright, general manager of United Liberty Productions, denied 
using the Fire Department or local firefighters, saying the telephone 
solicitations are legitimate. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's about money; that's what it's all about," said Wright, who has 
coordinated fund-raising efforts for the foundation for the past six years. "We 
interfere in their ability to raise money." 
</P>
<P>
 She said that the foundation, which was founded by now-deceased firefighter 
Robert Greenwell in 1986, is not affiliated with any fire department in Orange 
County, "because we don't want to be involved in politics." 
</P>
<P>
 The foundation raises money to help pay medical expenses for injured 
firefighters and provides loans and grants to disabled firefighters, Wright 
said. BERT ELJERA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SANTA ANA; REGULATED GARAGE SALES BEGIN TODAY

<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents will be allowed to hold garage sales this weekend for the first time 
since an ordinance regulating them went into effect, a city spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Code enforcement officials will be out today and Sunday to ensure that the 
sales meet city guidelines designed to keep them orderly, said Bruce Dunams, 
coordinator for community preservation. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the ordinance, approved earlier this year, residents may hold garage 
sales only during the first weekends of March, June, September and December. 
Anyone holding a sale outside the four sanctioned weekends risks a fine and 
will have the goods confiscated, pending a hearing.JON NALICK

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: HUNTINGTON BEACH; SEASONAL LIFEGUARDS TO VOTE ON UNION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DEBRA CANO 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Seasonal lifeguards will vote today on whether they want union representation. 
</P>
<P>
 The Surf City Lifeguards Employee Assn. decided to conduct the vote at the 
Huntington Beach Lifeguard Headquarters despite its disagreement with the city 
over how many votes are needed to secure union representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Silber, attorney representing seasonal lifeguards, contends that a 
majority of those who cast their votes would be sufficient. Deputy City 
Administrator Richard Barnard said a majority of all seasonal lifeguards -- 
about 100 employees -- must vote for union representation. 
</P>
<P>
 Silber said because many seasonal lifeguards already have left their summer 
job, there was concern that the association might not gain a majority vote. 
Because of that, association members have been lobbying hard this week, 
lifeguard Craig Shimomura, 25, said. 
</P>
<P>
 "We've been aggressively campaigning for this," Shimomura said. "We're 
confident we're going to have the numbers there."  
</P>
<P>
 Barnard said if a majority votes in favor of the union, it will become the 
exclusive bargaining representative for the seasonal lifeguards.  
</P>
<P>
 Seasonal lifeguards currently have no benefits, work for lower pay than 
year-round lifeguards and are not paid at a higher rate for overtime. DEBRA

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: BUENA PARK; PARKING RESTRICTIONS POLICY GETS INITIAL OK 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLEY WRIGHT 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Residents along narrow streets who want parking restricted to allow two-way 
traffic will have to collect signatures of 25% of their neighbors under a new 
policy tentatively approved by the City Council. 
</P>
<P>
 The Traffic and Transportation Commission developed the policy after it 
received requests last spring for restrictions on San Alto Way. 
</P>
<P>
 It discovered that most of the residents would rather put up with impeded 
traffic flow than lose street parking spaces, traffic engineer Herb Vargas 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic officials consider a street to be narrow if it has a curb-to-curb 
width of 28 feet or less.  
</P>
<P>
 When parking is permitted on both sides, cars going in opposite directions 
cannot pass each other. 
</P>
<P>
 Under the new policy, if some residents want no-parking signs on one side of 
the street, they must present petition signatures before the city considers the 
request. 
</P>
<P>
 Traffic officials will then conduct a survey and wait until 75% of neighbors 
have responded. If at least 67% of the respondents want the change, the city 
will consider it a consensus, Vargas said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council will consider the policy for final approval in early October.

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: ANAHEIM; HIGH SCHOOL OPENS IN FORMER MANSION 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DANIELLE A. FOUQUETTE 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Fairmont High School is probably one of the only high schools in the county 
with a working fireplace in its library. 
</P>
<P>
 Executive director David Jackson is even more amused by the walk-in vault in 
the new school's administrative wing. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've been kidding students that I found the perfect detention room for them," 
Jackson said, pointing to the shelf-lined chamber with the heavy metal door. 
</P>
<P>
 The fireplace, vault and various other unusual features that include a 
courtyard with fountain greeted students who started the fall semester Friday 
at the school, which opened at the 66-year-old Stanton estate. 
</P>
<P>
 The hacienda-style house was built in 1929 by Col. Philip A. Stanton and had 
9,500 square feet. An additional 15,000 square feet were added in the 1980s.  
</P>
<P>
 Fairmont Private Schools, which operates four other preschool through junior 
high schools in Anaheim, bought the property for $900,000 at an auction last 
January. 
</P>
<P>
 "We were planning to expand one of our other sites to add a high school, but 
then this property became available," Jackson said.  
</P>
<P>
 Jackson found the Stanton estate appealing because it reminds him of East 
Coast prep schools. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our aim is to prepare students for the top universities in the nation," 
Jackson said. "This setting adds to that feeling that this is a special place, 
that the students here are unique." 
</P>
<P>
 Founded by Jackson's stepfather in 1943, the chain of private schools has 
focused mainly on preschool through junior high school education. But Jackson, 
whose own children have attended the schools, said he was bothered by the lack 
of a high school. 
</P>
<P>
 "It was as if we were saying we would raise these children right for 13 years, 
then tell them, 'You're on your own' when they hit high school," he said. "I 
wanted to see them all the way through." 
</P>
<P>
 Jackson plunged into the more complex and expensive high school arena and 
ignored the advice of other private high school administrators, his wife and 
his stepfather. 
</P>
<P>
 "But just looking around at this beautiful building, seeing the high-quality 
instructors we hired, I know it was the right thing to do," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Ron Woerner, head of the new high school, said the arched doorways, graceful 
courtyard and brick walkways add up to the learning environment. 
</P>
<P>
 "It eliminates some of the sterility and coldness that you see in many 
schools," he said. "I think it will add to the seriousness of the students. It 
has the look and feel of a place where people come to do serious studying."

 The Irvine Unified School District board has unanimously approved an increase 
in developer fees, provoking only a slight rumble from the Irvine Co. 
</P>
<P>
 While the developer raised a few concerns about the process used to justify 
the new fees, Irvine Co. officials are not opposing the increases in the fees 
levied and collected by the school district on residential and commercial 
development in the district. 
</P>
<P>
 "The main thing we questioned was the district's estimates of the cost of 
school construction," said Irvine Co. spokeswoman Dawn McCormick. "They 
appeared to be high." 
</P>
<P>
 The higher the cost of school construction, the greater the justification the 
district has for charging the maximum fees allowed by law. 
</P>
<P>
 School board members say the district is raising developer fees to match the 
higher ceiling on such fees approved by the state Legislature in January. 
</P>
<P>
 The developer fees are used to pay for part of the costs of new school 
construction. The rest comes from the state. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine school district, which is planning two new schools, is required by 
law to pay its share of construction costs based on the maximum developer fees 
for the new construction, whether it actually levies them all or not. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't think the Irvine Co. or any other organization will oppose what we're 
doing, knowing if we don't increase these fees, we're going to have to pay them 
anyway," Supt. David E. Brown said. 
</P>
<P>
 The school board increased fees from $1.65 to $1.72 per square foot for 
residential development and from 27 cents to 28 cents per square foot for 
commercial and industrial development. 
</P>
<P>
 The Irvine Co. is asking the school district to revise its study on the cost 
of new school construction.  
</P>
<P>
 The law requires such a study to justify raising developer fees to the maximum 
amount. 
</P>
<P>
 But McCormick said Irvine Co. officials do not believe a revised study would 
cause the district to rescind the new fee increases. "The new fees appear to be 
reasonable," she said. RUSS LOAR

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: LAGUNA BEACH; COUNCIL CANDIDATES TO GET LOCAL TV TIME 
</P>

<P>
 City Council candidates will get three televised minutes apiece to speak to 
the public at the beginning of Tuesday's council meeting. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's a chance, early in the campaign, for people in town to get a brief 
introduction to who the candidates are," City Manager Kenneth C. Frank said. 
</P>
<P>
 The council had promised in February to make such local cable-access 
television time available to non-incumbents when it passed a law limiting 
campaign contributions. Opponents had said the law would give an unfair 
advantage to incumbents running for reelection. 
</P>
<P>
 As it turns out, with three terms expiring this year, Mayor Ann Christoph is 
the only incumbent up for reelection. Both Lida Lenney and Robert F. Gentry 
decided not to run again. 
</P>
<P>
 Many are predicting that 1994 will be a crucial election year for Laguna 
Beach, with the council's liberal majority possibly losing control for the 
first time in more than a decade. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is probably the one election the citizens of Laguna Beach need to be 
involved in more than any other in the last 12 years, no matter what they 
believe in," Gentry said. 
</P>
<P>
 The other nine candidates are: real estate broker, Wayne Baglin; attorney 
Steve Dicterow; community relations specialist Paul Freeman; attorney Ronald 
Harris; legal clerk Darin Henry; artist Beth Leeds; former professional 
football player Mel Owens; administrative assistant Mark Petersen, and media 
consultant John Schug. 
</P>
<P>
 A new political group Protect Laguna '94 this week endorsed Christoph, Freeman 
and Harris. Baglin and Dicterow won the nod earlier from a political action 
committee formed by city firefighters and from the Laguna Coalition, an 
umbrella group representing dozens of civic groups. 
</P>
<P>
 The council meeting begins at 6 p.m. LESLIE EARNEST

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: IRVINE; RESEARCHERS' WORK PEGGED TO TELETHON 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By RUSS LOAR 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 This Labor Day weekend, UC Irvine researcher Luis Villarreal will be keeping a 
close eye on the tote board at the annual muscular dystrophy telethon. His 
three-year, $342,000 research grant is contingent on the telethon's success. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get the feeling that people are kind of tired of hearing about this 
telethon," said Villarreal, one of a handful of researchers worldwide working 
on a genetic cure for the disease that affects more than 1 million young 
Americans. "The reality is that we are going to make some real progress in the 
attempts to deal with this disease soon. They shouldn't give up on us." 
</P>
<P>
 Villarreal, 45, a professor of molecular biology and biochemistry, is one of 
three UCI researchers whose work is funded by the Muscular Dystrophy Assn. 
Biological chemistry professor John Wasmuth and assistant researcher John 
McPherson are trying to locate the genes for two different types of the 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
 Villarreal is developing a procedure to replace the defective gene that causes 
the most common form of the disease, Duchenne muscular dystrophy. The disease 
is typically diagnosed in children by age 5 and often proves fatal by the early 
20s, due to respiratory failure. 
</P>
<P>
 "This is the most severe and cruelest form of the disease," said Dr. Leon 
Charash, a New York child neurologist and chairman of the Muscular Dystrophy 
Assn.'s Medical Advisory Committee. 
</P>
<P>
 Eight years ago, Muscular Dystrophy Assn. researchers discovered that a 
defective dystrophin gene was responsible for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. 
Villarreal's quest is to send a genetically engineered, fully functioning 
dystrophin gene into a patient's body where it would correct the deficiencies 
of the defective gene. 
</P>
<P>
 Villarreal is trying to devise a way to package a healthy dystrophin gene 
inside a common cold virus, called an adenovirus. The virus is considered the 
delivery system necessary for transmission of the dystrophin gene to the body's 
muscle cells. The challenge for researchers over the years has been to fit the 
large dystrophin gene into the cold virus, which has so far proved too small 
for task. 
</P>
<P>
 "If the scientists at UCI can make this virus bigger, it will not only clearly 
benefit people with muscular dystrophy, but it also may benefit people with a 
whole host of other genetic illnesses," Charash said. 
</P>
<P>
 Villarreal has designed a theoretical model for stripping away some of the 
contents of the cold virus in order to make room for the dystrophin gene. If 
his research proves successful, clinical tests on patients could begin within 
several years. 
</P>
<P>
 "The implications of all this are quite profound," Villarreal said. "If we can 
design a delivery vehicle, that vehicle would be applicable to most major 
diseases that we know of." 
</P>
<P>
 French researchers are trying the "shoe-horn" approach, according to 
Villarreal, attempting to fit a reduced version of the dystrophin gene into the 
cold virus. Muscular Dystrophy Assn. officials say such an attempt may at least 
arrest the development of the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 But Villarreal is confident that the entire dystrophin gene can be sent into 
the body, which would theoretically amount to a cure for the disease. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's not something that we've been able to solve yet," Villarreal said. "We 
are having to invent a whole new technology to cure this disease." RUSS LOAR

ORANGE COUNTY FOCUS: SAN CLEMENTE; CONTINUATION SCHOOL PLANS FALL THROUGH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF BEAN 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Less than a week before the start of the school year, officials at the 
Capistrano Unified School District must search anew for a site to house a 
planned San Clemente continuation school. 
</P>
<P>
 Plans for the campus, in the works for months, were seen in part as a way to 
provide classes for gang members fearful of attending the district's current 
continuation school, Serra High School, in San Juan Capistrano and in rival 
gang territory. 
</P>
<P>
 But negotiations over a lease for a two-story building on West El Portal ended 
Wednesday night, prompting the unexpected change of course. The district and 
the building owner could not reach a financial agreement, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
 "It really throws us a curve," said Thomas Anthony, assistant superintendent 
of secondary school operations. 
</P>
<P>
 As a temporary measure, the 55 expected students for the proposed San Clemente 
site will attend classes in portable buildings at San Clemente High School, 
Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
 Officials now hope to find a permanent site for the continuation school by 
November or December. 
</P>
<P>
 Dave Doomey, executive director of facilities and planning, said the district 
will conduct a search to determine if any buildings in San Clemente might be 
better than those identified earlier. When looking about eight months ago, the 
district studied four sites. 
</P>
<P>
 Doomey said the city of San Clemente and the state Department of Education are 
working closely with the district. Once a new proposed site is chosen, a city 
public hearing would be held, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 In February, Capistrano Unified trustees approved the concept of creating the 
continuation school in a San Clemente business park for students in grades 10 
through 12. 
</P>
<P>
 The school, called Rancho Alternative Education Center, was described in part 
as a "safe haven" for some members of San Clemente's Varrio Chico gang who had 
chosen to drop out of class rather than show up at Serra High School, which 
sits in turf of the rival San Juan Boyz gang. 
</P>
<P>
 District officials also said the Rancho continuation school was convenient, as 
well as necessary, because Serra High was nearing its 200-student capacity. 
</P>
<P>
 Serra High is expected to enroll about 180 students this fall, Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
 While temporarily housing local continuation students at San Clemente High 
School, Anthony said the district hopes to coax other students back to Serra 
High by assuring them that the school is safe. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to find out why they are not going," Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
 Finding a home for the continuation school in San Clemente could present a few 
obstacles. 
</P>
<P>
 The previously selected site in a business park on Calle Negocio drew 
criticism from one San Clemente resident who said the school's presence would 
"introduce an element that we don't want to see." 
</P>
<P>
 Doomey said the site was rejected by the state Department of Education because 
neighboring manufacturing businesses were too close. 
</P>
<P>
 Anthony said that setting up a continuation high school is "always a sensitive 
issue." He said the city has been supportive. 
</P>
<P>
 "We want to make sure we are not a detriment to the community," Anthony 
said.JEFF BEAN

EX-GANGSTERS FIGHT FOR SOCIAL, CIVIC CHANGE; COMMUNITY: SOLEVAR AND ITS ALLIES 
NOW WORK WITH NEIGHBORS, CITY HALL TO IMPROVE WEST ANAHEIM, LIVES OF AT-RISK 
YOUTH. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID A. AVILA, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Dressed in their street-style wardrobe of baggy pants, Pendleton shirts and 
the occasional headband, the members of Solevar tend to make heads turn in 
official circles and leave others feeling uneasy. 
</P>
<P>
 But while they still walk the walk and talk the talk of the gangsters many 
once were, the group's members say they traded in their weapons and graffiti 
paint for Robert's Rules of Order when they signed a charter to become Solevar, 
Spanish for "to raise" or "to lift up." 
</P>
<P>
 The organization was started two years ago by members of a west Anaheim gang 
known as Oeste (West), and it wasn't long before non-gang members joined, 
attracted by Solevar's goal of community empowerment. 
</P>
<P>
 Since then, group members have successfully persuaded the city to repair 
traffic lights and install crosswalks, and have familiarized themselves with 
parliamentary procedure. 
</P>
<P>
 "When we first started, we didn't even know what an agenda was," said Raymond 
Campos, the group's president. "Now we know what an agenda is, and we won't 
start any meeting without one." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Still, Solevar is relatively new at the political action game, and its members 
are just beginning to understand how much effort is needed to accomplish even 
the smallest goal, such as organizing a carwash. 
</P>
<P>
 Many city officials say they know little about the organization. Mayor Tom 
Daly said he knows of it by name, and Frank Rosales, a member of the city's 
community services board, called the group "dedicated and well-intended." 
</P>
<P>
 "One of the things I see is that they are trying to provide job training for 
the youth," Rosales said. "They are particularly effective with dropouts 
seeking jobs." 
</P>
<P>
 Nevertheless, the budding organization vigorously attacks each task. 
</P>
<P>
 "It's an overused word, but Solevar is truly a grass-roots organization," said 
Manuel Marquez, a financial aid counselor at Cal State Fullerton, and a member 
of Solevar. "They're trying to get job opportunities, food and clothing banks, 
and their youth back to school. 
</P>
<P>
 "They're doing it in a manner that works because they are action oriented. 
There are a lot of organizations that talk and talk, but Solevar wants things 
to happen now. That's why I joined them." 
</P>
<P>
 Solevar's primary goals are to give neighborhood teens the resources to expand 
their education and put an end to the street warfare that has affected some 
members' lives. 
</P>
<P>
 However, their commitment to nonviolence has been tested during the last 10 
months, when three members of their organization have been gunned down in 
separate shootings in Orange County. 
</P>
<P>
 Several members of the organization said that in the past, they would have 
retaliated, but now are committed to maintaining their pledge for an end to 
gang violence. 
</P>
<P>
 "What they did to my brother, that was cowardly," said 17-year-old Pete 
Aguirre, the brother of one of the slain men. "I wish nobody ever got into 
gangs. You're playing with your life. Look at my brother." 
</P>
<P>
 Aguirre, who wants to attend college, said it's hard for Solevar members to 
refrain from seeking revenge for the shootings. But Aguirre and other members 
have "given their word" and intend to keep it, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Solevar's executive director, Seferino Garcia, said that in less than two 
years the group has reached many of its goals, including raising money for 
college scholarships and creating job training and youth programs. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Now, Solevar hopes to raise $180,000 for a youth center that would give 
neighborhood youngsters an alternative to the street. The group has submitted a 
proposal for community development block grant funding. 
</P>
<P>
 Some city officials say they are leery of establishing a community center in 
conjunction with Solevar because the group is "an unknown quantity" and needs 
to be looked at more closely. 
</P>
<P>
 Chris Jarvi, director of Parks and Community Service for the city of Anaheim, 
said city officials have seen the proposal for the community center. The 
six-month delay since Solevar's application was filed is not unusual, he said. 
</P>
<P>
 Because Solevar is untested in such projects, the city wants to find out more 
before agreeing to fund the proposed project, Jarvi said. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's transformation from street gang to socially conscious organization 
was initiated by several older residents of the community. 
</P>
<P>
 On Sept. 16, Mexican Independence Day, in 1992, Campos, a 31-year-old resident 
of the neighborhood, depressed after losing yet another "homeboy" to gang 
warfare, approached Garcia, a community organizer, for advice on forming an 
organization to provide sports and other activities for neighborhood youth. 
</P>
<P>
 That day, the two talked for hours and formulated the outline for Solevar. 
</P>
<P>
 "I remember that day like it was yesterday," Campos said. "I felt really bad, 
and I just kept walking and walking, when I got this idea to see Seferino 
Garcia. He had done a lot of work in the community, so I thought he could help 
us." 
</P>
<P>
 Word of Solevar's efforts has caught the attention of senior citizens, 
non-Latinos and educators who, in their own ways, have sought to improve the 
area. 
</P>
<P>
 Some of them have joined Solevar. Ross Romero, a real estate broker and 
president of UCI's Chicano Alumni Assn., said Solevar can have a "tremendous" 
impact on the neighborhood and surrounding communities. He said he was 
especially attracted to Solevar's attempt to help neighborhoods gain political 
power and self-sufficiency. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Richard Ornelas, at 65 one of the oldest members of Solevar, began working 
with the Anaheim gang task force and now works with Solevar's "elders council." 
</P>
<P>
 "One day (members of Solevar) came to me for advice on how to get a youth 
center. That was exactly what I had wanted to do, so I joined their 
organization. They are all very committed." 
</P>
<P>
 Ornelas has helped organize trips to Big Bear Lake for 20 neighborhood teens 
in conjunction with the YMCA and the Boys Club. Solevar also raised money to 
help send more than 100 teens to the mountains this summer, to give them 
experiences in a new environment. 
</P>
<P>
 As city officials ponder the fate of the youth center, 31-year-old Solevar 
member Dwayne Flores said group members have already achieved much of what was 
previously believed to be impossible. 
</P>
<P>
 Flores, one of the leaders of the organization, said that "Two years ago, we 
didn't know what CDBG (community development block grants) was. Now we go to 
the CDBG meetings and help (influence the spending of) $2.3 million." 
</P>
<P>
 "I've done my share of bad. Well, now this is the time for giving back," 
Flores said. "There are a lot of young Chicanos in prison, and I would rather 
see them become doctors, lawyers, judges or going to the moon."

LATINO GROUPS VOW EFFORT TO RESTORE SUSPENDED CLUB 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIMI KO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Latino organizations in Orange County expressed outrage Friday over the arrest 
of four student protesters, who along with about 80 others this week staged a 
rally demanding the reinstatement of a club that has been removed at Golden 
West College. 
</P>
<P>
 Several Latino groups vowed to support the students in their fight to get the 
club, Movimiento Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan, or MEChA, recognized again by 
the Huntington Beach college.  
</P>
<P>
 The club was suspended last spring by the college administration, which 
alleged that it held a fund-raiser on campus where drinking occurred. The 
suspension was later lifted, but the college will not recognize MEChA as an 
official club unless new officers and a new adviser are chosen. 
</P>
<P>
 "The constitutional rights of the students were taken away," said Vera 
Palomino, a member of Manos Unidos, a nonprofit Westminster-based organization 
that provides scholarships to Latino high school students. "It's outrageous. 
</P>
<P>
 "We will stand behind the students and support them in any way that they 
want," she said. "I hope the rest of the Latino community will stand up and 
defend these students." 
</P>
<P>
 Sharleen Maldonado, chairwoman of the Hispanic Business Roundtable, a group 
made up of Latina business owners who address economic policies, said her 
organization intends to go one step further. 
</P>
<P>
 "The only things that will solve the problem is money and a change of 
attitude," said Maldonado, who founded the Mexican American Women's National 
Assn. 21 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
 "I am willing to help write and get grants from the federal government so the 
MEChA club will have the financial support to be a true support system for the 
educational benefits for Hispanics -- because if the college won't support 
MEChA, we will."  
</P>
<P>
 Three MEChA members -- Ana Carbajal, 28, of Garden Grove, Lupe Lopez, 21, of 
Stanton and Claudia Rochin, 20, of Westminster -- were arrested Thursday as 
they sat in the college president's office with their wrists linked in chains 
and combination locks while a crowd outside held a boisterous rally. It ended 
after a lieutenant backed by 42 officers in riot gear ordered the participants 
to disperse.  
</P>
<P>
 The women were booked on suspicion of trespassing and disrupting campus 
business. Rochin also was booked on suspicion of felony assault on a police 
officer. 
</P>
<P>
 David Rojas, 22, of Fullerton was arrested and booked on suspicion of 
resisting arrest and prohibiting police activity. 
</P>
<P>
 Rojas and Carbajal each were released late Thursday night on $500 bail. Rochin 
and Lopez were expected to be released Friday night.  
</P>
<P>
 John Palacio, director of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational 
Fund, or MALDEF, and Arturo Montez, president of the Santa Ana chapter of the 
League of United Latin American Citizens, said they will offer to act as 
mediators between MEChA and the college's administration in an effort to 
resolve the dispute.  
</P>
<P>
 "We don't have a stake in the issue other than resolving it," Palacio said. 
"We are concerned, however, when a Latino organization is denied the ability to 
assemble and establish itself. . . . Perhaps an organization such as MALDEF can 
help come up with a positive resolution." 
</P>
<P>
 Golden West President Philip Westin and MEChA President Luis Guizar said they 
would welcome such mediation. 
</P>
<P>
 Westin said he received numerous calls from people on both sides of the issue. 
Some offered support for his suspending MEChA last spring over an event it 
sponsored where alcohol was allegedly being consumed, and others disagreed with 
his action. 
</P>
<P>
 "I don't know what the fallout is," he said. "Frankly, I hope we get past 
this."GOLDEN WEST

PORT THEATRE SCHEDULED FOR A FACE LIFT AT AGE 45 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By ZAN DUBIN, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The single-screen Port Theatre would be expanded into a triplex and get a face 
lift under plans filed by its owner with the city of Newport Beach. 
</P>
<P>
 The Landmark Theatre Corp. intends to refurbish the 925-seat Port and split 
its spacious balcony area into two 100-seat theaters, while leaving its 
first-floor seating configuration much the same, said Christie Teague, an 
associate city planner. 
</P>
<P>
 The reconstruction would eliminate about 100 seats from the balcony area only, 
Teague said. Refurbishment plans include new wallpaper, carpet and lighting 
fixtures. 
</P>
<P>
 The city's Planning Department has not yet issued a permit for the theater's 
reconstruction, but "we have no reason to think it's not going to happen," 
Teague said. She could not say when a decision would be made. 
</P>
<P>
 Landmark Corp. officials could not be reached for comment about the plans. 
</P>
<P>
 The 45-year-old theater, long an unofficial local landmark, has been a magnet 
to fans of foreign and limited-release films. Last summer, a spokesman for the 
Los Angeles-based Landmark Corp. told The Times that company officials wished 
they had more theaters playing such fare in Orange County because the Port did 
"very good business." 
</P>
<P>
 Indeed, the number of local cinemas showing foreign or limited-release films 
recently grew with the opening of Edwards Theatres Circuit Inc.'s Rancho Niguel 
8. The new Laguna Niguel outlet occasionally screens these films.  
</P>
<P>
 Other such venues include the Bay Theatre in Seal Beach, Cinemapolis in 
Anaheim and Edwards South Coast Plaza Village.

2 CANDIDATES' STATEMENTS BARRED BY COURT; POLITICS: SAMPLE-BALLOT REMARKS IN 
IRVINE RANCH WATER DISTRICT RACE ASSAILED THE INCUMBENTS, WHO FILED SUIT. JUDGE 
ORDERS THE COMMENTS DELETED. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 An Orange County Superior Court judge on Friday barred most of the written 
statements of two Irvine Ranch Water District board candidates from the 
county's November sample ballot, siding with two incumbents who claimed the 
statements amounted to a "hit piece" against them. 
</P>
<P>
 With little comment, Judge Leonard Goldstein ordered the county registrar of 
voters office to delete large sections of the 200-word candidate statements 
submitted by water district challengers Scott Peotter and Lesley Ann Stoll. 
Only several sentences were left intact. 
</P>
<P>
 Incumbents Peer Swan and Ray Auerbach filed suit last month against the 
registrar of voters and the two candidates, seeking to bar the written 
statements from the sample ballot. 
</P>
<P>
 After the court hearing, Orange County Assistant Registrar Don Taylor made the 
line-by-line deletions in the seventh-floor hallway outside the courtroom, 
working feverishly to meet a 5 p.m. deadline. Taylor had to submit the revised 
candidate statements to the printer by day's end to avoid a delay in the 
mailing of the county's 1.1 million sample ballots for the Nov. 8 election. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor said the court ruling will have no effect on procedures at the 
registrar of voters office. 
</P>
<P>
 "It does not set any precedent for us that I can see," Taylor said. "We don't 
tell people what they can and can't put in a candidate statement. It is always 
open to court challenges." 
</P>
<P>
 The candidate statements in question alleged that Swan and Auerbach, board 
members since 1979, authorized construction of two "palatial" water district 
office buildings, raised water rates and imposed "excess" drought penalties on 
water users. 
</P>
<P>
 Both incumbents say the accusations are blatantly false. But Goldstein's 
decision, based in part on a 1992 California Supreme Court ruling involving 
judicial candidates, did not take into account whether the statements were true 
or false. Goldstein simply ruled that the challengers' ballot statements should 
be limited to biographical information. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're preserving the candidate statement as the state set it up to be," said 
Swan, 50, treasurer of a Newport Beach electrical manufacturing company. "It's 
not supposed to be a place where you can print a sleazy hit piece on other 
people." 
</P>
<P>
 Attorney Howard Klein, representing the two water board challengers, argued in 
court that the term "qualifications" should be broadly interpreted to allow a 
frank discussion of issues by candidates. 
</P>
<P>
 "I believe what a candidate feels about the issues in a particular race is 
appropriate," Klein said. By limiting the statements to biographical 
information, Klein said the sample ballot becomes "a cure for insomnia." 
</P>
<P>
 Peotter, 37, an Irvine architect, said he believes such court decision will 
have a chilling effect on candidates with few financial resources who are 
considering running against incumbents. 
</P>
<P>
 "It gives additional power to incumbents," Peotter said. "The candidate 
statement is the most important opportunity that many candidates have."

HEALTH PLAN FOR POOR DRAWS CRITICISM; MEDICINE: CARE OF LOW-INCOME PEOPLE MAY 
DECLINE UNDER AN HMO CALLED OPTIMA, LEADERS IN THE VIETNAMESE COMMUNITY SAY. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LESLIE BERKMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The medical care of low-income Vietnamese may decline sharply under a health 
maintenance organization called OPTIMA that is being crafted to improve medical 
access for Orange County's poor, Councilman Tony Lam and other critics warned 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
 Lam said that he, gastroenterologist Christopher D. Bui and pharmacist Hieu 
Duc Tran will go on a Vietnamese radio station Sunday and urge listeners to 
join a campaign to make sure their interests are heard. 
</P>
<P>
 They said they believe that OPTIMA, or Orange Prevention Treatment Integrated 
Medical Assistance program, is being designed to benefit large HMOs while 
excluding independent physicians and pharmacists. And this prospect, they 
argued, bodes ill for Vietnamese patients. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 OPTIMA officials, however, have yet to settle on a health care delivery 
system. That decision will be made at the end of the month after a public 
hearing. 
</P>
<P>
 Bui said the new system, which will create networks of health care providers 
who are paid a fixed amount of money monthly to serve Medi-Cal recipients, may 
help indigent patients in other parts of Orange County who have had great 
difficulty finding physicians who will accept the low reimbursement rates 
offered by Medi-Cal, California's insurance program for the poor. But he said 
the poor in the Little Saigon community of Westminster have access to all the 
medical care they need. "In the Vietnamese community, we have all kinds of 
specialists willing to take Medi-Cal," Bui said. 
</P>
<P>
 Moreover, Bui said, it is common for Vietnamese physicians even to extend 
services for which they are not paid and to make themselves available to 
Medi-Cal patients 24 hours a day. 
</P>
<P>
 Bui said he is concerned that a health management organization would "tie the 
hands" of Vietnamese physicians by limiting the care they can provide to save 
money for the program. 
</P>
<P>
 It is important, Bui said, that these patients have the choice of keeping 
their doctors. "The system is working well for this community," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 According to the Orange County Department of Social Services, about 9% of the 
county's 286,000 Medi-Cal beneficiaries are Vietnamese. 
</P>
<P>
 Tran said he is concerned that OPTIMA will seek to save money by contracting 
with large pharmacy chains that can obtain drugs at a discount, thereby 
excluding some 30 independent Vietnamese pharmacies that give counseling in the 
Vietnamese language. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Mary K. Dewane, chief executive officer of OPTIMA, said as yet no design has 
been chosen for OPTIMA's health care delivery system. She said she has been 
meeting with groups of physicians throughout the county, and OPTIMA's board of 
directors will have a public hearing Sept. 13 before deciding Sept. 20 on the 
basic structure of the organization, which is expected to begin operation next 
summer. 
</P>
<P>
 "I think the board has been very specific about its desires to include the 
traditional providers who have long been serving the Medi-Cal population, 
including the providers who are linguistically and culturally appropriate for 
the population, in any system that will evolve for OPTIMA," Dewane said. 
</P>
<P>
 But Lam said he believes that Dewane and the OPTIMA board privately favor a 
plan that would require doctors and patients to become part of one of the large 
health maintenance organizations that already are established.  
</P>
<P>
 Calling it "baloney" that the OPTIMA staff hasn't picked a model, he said, "I 
feel the whole thing has been railroaded for the benefit of the big HMOs." 
</P>
<P>
 Bui and Tran said they have begun passing around a petition calling for OPTIMA 
to preserve the right for patients to choose their doctors outside an HMO. Bui 
said so far they have collected 2,000 signatures on the petition that they 
intend to submit Sept. 13 to the OPTIMA board.

MAN LEAPS TO HIS DEATH AT DISNEYLAND HOTEL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 A man in his 70s apparently jumped to his death Friday from the ninth floor of 
the Bonita Tower at the Disneyland Hotel, a Disneyland spokesman said. 
</P>
<P>
 Authorities found two notes on the man's body, according to John McClintock, 
one in Chinese and a briefer one in English, directing that a relative in 
Southern California be contacted by phone. 
</P>
<P>
 The man was staying at another part of the hotel, McClintock said, having 
checked in alone Thursday. He apparently plunged from a fire escape landing 
near a bank of elevators, landing on the roof of a first floor lobby. To get to 
the landing, McClintock said, the man had to climb over a railing. 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim police are investigating the death.

PARENTS, SISTER OF TEEN TB VICTIM SAY THEY CAUGHT DISEASE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By DAVID HALDANE, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 The parents and sister of a teen-ager who sued the Garden Grove Unified School 
District after contracting tuberculosis from a fellow student at La Quinta High 
School have filed a second lawsuit contending that they caught the disease as 
well. 
</P>
<P>
 In the suit, filed Thursday in Orange County Superior Court, Fred and Patti 
French allege an unidentified group of doctors was negligent in "diagnosing, 
treating and caring for those students at La Quinta High School who had been 
infected with contagious tuberculosis."  
</P>
<P>
 According to the lawsuit, Fred French was diagnosed with "active" tuberculosis 
in May, 1993, and his wife and daughter Cyndi were found to have the disease 
five months later. 
</P>
<P>
 The lawsuit marks the first time that Fred French has claimed to have an 
active case of tuberculosis. In claims filed against the school district in 
June, the family members said they had tested positive for the TB bacteria and 
were given drugs to reduce the possibility that they might become ill in the 
future. 
</P>
<P>
 Only Debi French, their 18-year-old daughter who attended La Quinta High, had 
contracted the disease and eventually lost part of a lung as a result, 
according to the claim. 
</P>
<P>
 Earlier this week, Debi French filed a lawsuit against the school district and 
the Orange County Health Care Agency contending that they negligently failed to 
warn the La Quinta student body after they learned in January, 1991, that a 
student was found to have contagious tuberculosis. 
</P>
<P>
 Bob Ragsdale, one of the French family's attorneys, said Friday that the 
family does not yet know the identities of the doctors involved in diagnosing 
those early cases. Eventually, he said, that information would emerge. 
</P>
<P>
 Ragsdale also declined to say how much his clients were seeking from the 
unidentified doctors in damages. "Obviously we will want to provide for their 
health care and so forth," he said.

HENLEY CLEARED TO TRAVEL BY JUDGE; JURISPRUDENCE: RAMS SAY THEY WILL PROBABLY 
RE-SIGN CORNERBACK IF THEY CAN HELP HIM RAISE BAIL OF $2 MILLION. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MARK PLATTE and T.J. SIMERS, TIMES STAFF WRITERS 
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
 A federal judge has cleared the way for Darryl Henley to travel to road games 
with the Rams without a court escort, and the team's president said Friday that 
if certain conditions are met, the team "will probably re-sign him." 
</P>
<P>
 Ram President John Shaw said Friday that if Coach Chuck Knox wants Henley 
back, as it appears he does, and if the team can help Henley raise his 
$2-million bail while minimizing the club's liability for the entire amount, 
Henley could rejoin the team as early as next week. 
</P>
<P>
 "All right!" Henley said Friday. "Things have been crazy. I hope nothing 
changes again. I want to play for the Rams. A number of people have gone 
overboard in helping. Maybe it's because they believe in the system." 
</P>
<P>
 U. S. District Judge Gary L. Taylor sided with Henley's attorneys, dropping 
the provision that a U. S. marshal or pretrial services agency officer 
accompany Henley on the road, so long as the $2 million was posted and Henley 
came up with an additional $200,000 cash deposit. 
</P>
<P>
 The Rams had indicated that they had no interest in re-signing Henley if an 
escort had to be used. Henley's attorneys said the escort "would cause undue 
disruption to the team's ability to prepare for, and play in, the games in 
question." 
</P>
<P>
 But the judge's ruling, and Shaw's statement that Henley's return to the team 
was likely, appears to have given the troubled cornerback new life as he awaits 
trial in January as a suspect in a conspiracy to distribute cocaine from his 
home in Brea. If convicted, he faces a maximum punishment of life in federal 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
 Shaw said he was still awaiting a detailed copy of the judge's ruling, but if 
the only restriction was a financial one, then the team would talk to Henley's 
representatives about the manner in which the $2-million bail was raised. Shaw 
emphasized the Rams would not be responsible for the entire amount. 
</P>
<P>
 "As long as the (financial) risk is not great," Shaw said, "we will probably 
re-sign him." 
</P>
<P>
 If the Rams do re-sign Henley, considered one of the team's best defensive 
players, they will have to release another player. The team would like to 
re-sign Henley next week and avoid a distraction before Sunday's regular-season 
opener with Arizona in Anaheim Stadium, but they would be better served 
financially to release a player before the game. 
</P>
<P>
 Any player on the 53-man roster as of Sunday is entitled to half his salary 
regardless of when released. 
</P>
<P>
 As for Henley, in his sixth year with the team, the Rams have been in a 
quandary about what to do with him since his indictment last year. Team 
officials agreed in August to sign him to a one-year, $350,000 contract, but 
were assured his travel would not be restricted. 
</P>
<P>
 However, the terms of his bail prohibited him from leaving the Central 
District of California, including Orange and Los Angeles counties, without 
approval. 
</P>
<P>
 When Henley's attorneys petitioned the court for the football player to travel 
with the team to games outside the district, Taylor allowed him to do so only 
if Henley, or a "responsible third party" such as the Rams, could come up $1 
million bail. 
</P>
<P>
 Taylor also ordered that a U.S. marshal or pretrial services officer accompany 
him on all road games -- even sitting beside him on the bench during the games 
-- to make sure Henley didn't flee. 
</P>
<P>
 Team officials, however, were strongly opposed to the escort. 
</P>
<P>
 They suggested having an off-duty Anaheim police officer who travels with the 
team keep an eye on Henley. 
</P>
<P>
 Henley's attorneys suggested an increased bail of $2 million if Henley were 
allowed to travel without outside supervision. Taylor agreed, and in his ruling 
Friday said the Rams "may privately arrange for security to further supervise 
Mr. Henley." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal prosecutors filed legal papers Friday opposing Henley's request to 
travel without a court escort, calling him a flight risk and a danger to the 
community. 
</P>
<P>
 "The government opposes substituting a local police officer employed by the 
Los Angeles Rams for the federal escort ordered by the court," prosecutors 
wrote. "A federal officer is more directly accountable to this court than an 
off-duty police officer employed by the Rams." 
</P>
<P>
 Federal officials fear that Henley may be contacted by drug dealers or other 
associates during trips. 
</P>
<P>
 A U. S. marshal or a pretrial services officer was necessary, prosecutors 
argued, to make sure that Henley does not make contact with anyone associated 
with the case. 
</P>
<P>
 "Without this condition, defendant's movements would be unrestricted and he 
would be able to meet other witnesses in Atlanta and across the country without 
fear of detection by authorities," prosecutors said. Henley is accused of 
making cross-country shipments to drop-off points in Memphis and Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the pledge to post the $2-million bail, "forfeiture of the travel bond 
(should Henley not appear at trial) will do little to serve the interests of 
justice if the government is forced to proceed with trial without the head of 
the cocaine ring," the prosecutors argued. 
</P>
<P>
 Judge Taylor kept all other aspects of his order intact, including a provision 
that Henley's salary should go into an escrow account controlled by a pretrial 
services officer who would provide Henley with living expenses and legal costs 
associated with the trial.

PREP FOOTBALL '94 / ORANGE LEAGUE; DROUGHNS GROWING INTO HIS LEAD ROLE; 
FOOTBALL: AFTER MAKING THE GRADE AS A SOPHOMORE, HE WANTS TO TAKE THE COLONISTS 
HIGHER AS A JUNIOR. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>

<P>
 Reuben Droughns thought the feelings of self-doubt were gone, but the 
troubling questions rushed back into him like a blitzing linebacker as he 
stared nervously at the Glover Stadium stands on opening night last season. 
</P>
<P>
 Within minutes, Droughns, a sophomore, would debut as Anaheim High's starting 
tailback. But as Droughns watched the stadium fill, he wondered, "What am I 
doing here?" 
</P>
<P>
 "I didn't know what to expect," he said. "I could have been taken out at any 
time. People were telling me I was good enough, but I didn't think I was; a lot 
of pressure." 
</P>
<P>
 But not enough to stop him. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns rushed for 258 yards and scored three touchdowns in 25 carries, 
leading Anaheim to a 28-21 nonleague victory over Fullerton. Ever since, 
Anaheim's opponents have felt the pressure. 
</P>
<P>
 With Droughns propelling the offense, the Colonists reached the quarterfinals 
of the Southern Section Division VI playoffs. Droughns enters his junior season 
bigger and better -- and gunning for Orange County's all-time rushing record. 
And that's just the news Orange League coaches didn't need. 
</P>
<P>
 "Last year, being a sophomore on the varsity, I was just trying to get a 
little respect," Droughns said. "This year, everybody is going to key on me. I 
know there might be some people saying, 'He's a one-time-only deal,' but I'm 
going to do my best to prove them wrong." 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns' opening-night smash sparked a long-running hit, which culminated 
with his selection as Cal-Hi Sports sophomore player of the year.  
</P>
<P>
 He gained 2,039 yards last season, seventh-most in county history, with 18 
touchdowns. Along with his brothers, Robert (defensive end), now a junior, and 
Killian Nowden (defensive back), a senior, Droughns helped inexperienced 
Anaheim succeed.  
</P>
<P>
 Droughns needs 1,643 yards to break Mickey Flynn's all-time school record for 
rushing yards (3,681), established from 1954-56. Barring injury, Droughns has a 
shot at the all-time county rushing record of 5,396 yards, set by Valencia's 
Ray Pallares (1983-85). 
</P>
<P>
 Only 16, Droughns is 6 feet 1 and 187 pounds, and he can bench-press 230 
pounds. His long, muscular frame and fluid running style reminds first-year 
Coach Allen Carter, an Anaheim assistant for three seasons, of another talented 
running back, Marcus Allen. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's very deceptive, just like Marcus," said Carter, also a former USC 
tailback (1971-75). "He looks like he's going one direction and then shoots 
another direction. Just when it looks like he's going to be tackled, he 
straightens up and he's off." 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns was at his best in the playoffs, rushing for 361 yards in the 
visiting Colonists' 34-32 upset of El Monte Arroyo in the opening round of the 
Division VI playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Despite this standout runner's early success, Carter said Droughns still has 
much to learn. 
</P>
<P>
 "He needs to be more disciplined in reading his blockers," Carter said. "He 
needs to become more mature as a runner." 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns knows Carter is right, so he listens -- and learns. 
</P>
<P>
 "I get along great with Coach Carter," he said. "He teaches me a lot." 
</P>
<P>
 Carter intends to keep the lessons fresh. 
</P>
<P>
 The Colonists ran about 90% of the time last season, but Carter wants more 
balance. Obviously, Droughns will get his carries, but Carter wants him to 
become a better receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 "We'd like to get him outside more with passes," Carter said. "We definitely 
want to utilize his talents." 
</P>
<P>
 If Droughns continues along his present path, Carter foresees a bright future 
for his pupil. 
</P>
<P>
 "If he just keeps working hard," Carter said, "he can go a long way."

 THE COLLEGES 
</P>
<P>
 Nearly everyone breathed a sigh of relief during the weekend when a strike by 
college football players was averted after they agreed to a cap on 
under-the-table payments from boosters. Houston might not have been so happy, 
however, because no strike means the Cougars will resume losing and probably 
repeat as Bottom Ten champs. Also vying are two unexpected entries--West 
Virginia (0-1) and Fresno State (0-1), currently two of the losingest teams in 
the nation. 
</P>
<P>
 Analysts have said that Fresno State, which lost starting quarterback Trent 
Dilfer to the semi-pros (Tampa Bay), will have to claw and scratch its way to 
victories this season. Perhaps that's why one player was involved in a bar 
fight in which he allegedly bit off part of a man's lip. He gave it back.

 Rout of the Week: FSU (Free Shoes U.) Seminoles over Virginia.

 Longest winless streak in NCAA: Chapman (Calif.) University hasn't had a

don't open against just anyone, either--the dreaded Fighting Poets of Whittier 
College.

</P>
<P>
 Los Angeles Lamb players have apparently been on strike since the season began 
in support of their major league baseball brothers. Stuck with replacement 
players, the team compiled an 0-4 exhibition record, scoring a grand total of 
42 points and establishing itself as the Bottom Ten favorite. 
</P>
<P>
 Team management has even criticized the stadium, insisting that--for reasons 
unknown to science--the Lambs always seem to be moving uphill when they have 
the ball there. 
</P>
<P>
 The early line on individual 1994 flops, meanwhile, favors such entries as 
ESPN's Phil (I Used to Hate Interviews) Simms and Tampa Bay quarterback Trent 
Dilfer, who is a threat to line up behind anyone on the offensive line. But the 
most spectacular washout could be Indianapolis' unproductive running back 
Marshall Faulk, who is starting ahead of promising Roosevelt Potts. Mark our 
words. It's only a matter of time before Indianapolis goes to Potts. BOTTOM TEN

PREP FOOTBALL '94 / TOP PLAYERS, TEAMS; A 25-POINT PLAN FOR A PREP FOOTBALL FAN 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By CHRIS FOSTER, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Here are 25 must-know items for the 1994 high school football season: 
</P>
<P>
 1. GENERATION X'S AND O'S 
</P>
<P>
 Reuben Droughns may be the finest running back to play at Anaheim High, but is 
he the best on the Anaheim sideline? 
</P>
<P>
 Allen Carter, his coach, wasn't too shabby either. 
</P>
<P>
 Carter gained 4,388 yards and scored 70 touchdowns at La Verne Bonita from 
1968-70. As a senior, he gained 1,915 yards and scored 33 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Droughns gained 2,039 yards as a sophomore last year, topping Carter's 
single-season best. He is on pace to surpass his coach's career mark as well. 
</P>
<P>
 "Don't tell him that," Carter said. "He could easily do it, but don't tell him 
about it. It will be good, but don't tell him about it." 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry coach. Too late. 2. IT'S A YOUNG MAN'S WORLD 
</P>
<P>
 So who's better? Droughns or Carter? Well, Droughns of course. Carter's in his 
40s. 3. KING OF THE HILL 
</P>
<P>
 Let's see, last season Los Alamitos defeated Esperanza, Marina, Edison, 
Fountain Valley and Huntington Beach. All five are in the Sunset League with 
the Griffins this season. So doesn't that make the Griffins the defending 
Sunset League champions? 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos beat Esperanza in Empire League play and Marina in a nonleague 
game. The Griffins then steamrolled Edison, Fountain Valley and Huntington 
Beach in the Division II playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 More than one Griffin player suggested that the Sunset League championship 
trophy be handed over after the title game. 4. NEXT! 
</P>
<P>
 Kevin Feterik, just another cog in the Los Alamitos' quarterback machine. 
</P>
<P>
 Feterik, a junior, follows in the footsteps of some heavy hitters. 
</P>
<P>
 1993 -- Mike Good (Northern Arizona) threw for 2,969 yards and 35 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 1992 -- Tim Carey (Stanford) threw for 3,397 yards and 35 touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 1991 -- Carey threw for 2,501 yards. 
</P>
<P>
 Now comes Feterik, who is right in that company. He was invited to a 
quarterback camp at Cal State Los Angeles during the summer -- which included 
college quarterbacks -- and finished first among 60. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's cool," Coach John Barnes said. "He was incredible during the summer, and 
we have him for two years." 5. ON THE RECEIVING END 
</P>
<P>
 If Feterik throws 'em, Brad Melsby will catch 'em. 
</P>
<P>
 Melsby, a senior wide receiver, caught 77 passes for 1,261 yards and 17 
touchdowns last season -- all ranking in the top five in county history. He had 
four touchdown receptions against Palmdale. Melsby has 110 career receptions. 
</P>
<P>
 It'll be tough to double-cover Melsby because Tony Hartley also lines up at 
wide receiver for the Griffins. He had 25 receptions, 10 of which went for 
touchdowns, and averaged 21 yards per catch. 
</P>
<P>
 "With our receivers, anything in the vicinity gets caught," Barnes said. 6. 
STREAKS 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos has not lost in 35 games. Ocean View has not won in 29 games. 
</P>
<P>
 The two teams, thankfully, don't play each other this season. 7. DeWAYNE'S 
WORLD 
</P>
<P>
 As a runner, DeWayne Crenshaw is among the best. But when he runs off at the 
mouth, he stumbles a bit. 
</P>
<P>
 After Costa Mesa defeated Trabuco Hills, 13-3, last season, Crenshaw boldly 
stated that the Pacific Coast League race was over. Never mind that the 
Mustangs had two games remaining, against Estancia and Century. 
</P>
<P>
 "No one's going to get in our way," Crenshaw said. "We own Century. We own 
Estancia." 
</P>
<P>
 Well, they did own Estancia, Century wasn't on the market. The Centurions tied 
the Mustangs, 7-7. Still, the Mustangs did win the first outright league title 
in the school's history. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw, who also plays defensive end, was a big part of that success, 
gaining 930 yards and scoring 14 touchdowns. He was the only bright spot in the 
Mustangs' first section title game. His 60-yard touchdown run was the Mustangs' 
only score in a 44-6 loss to Trabuco Hills in the Division VII final. 
</P>
<P>
 Crenshaw certainly will have the Mustangs in the running for a second league 
title, but don't expect more predictions. 8. MEAL TICKET 
</P>
<P>
 Having Santa Margarita Coach Jim Hartigan over for dinner might be nice, but 
it can get expensive. 
</P>
<P>
 Parents of Eagle football players can bid to have Hartigan as a guest. It's 
part of an auction during the program's annual dinner/dance. Starting bids are 
$500 and top out at $1,000. For that, Hartigan will scrape scraps off your 
plate. 
</P>
<P>
 "The first year, the deal was that I would come over and fix dinner," Hartigan 
said. "I used to be a cook in a restaurant. But I found out the mothers were 
much better cooks. So now I come over, eat and we have good conversation." 
</P>
<P>
 At those prices, it better be. 9. BEEFY BOOKENDS 
</P>
<P>
 The Hartigan Value Meal could be worse. He could bring along senior tackles 
Kris Farris and Josh Beckett, two big reasons the Eagles might win the Sea View 
League title. 
</P>
<P>
 Farris is 6 feet 8, 275 pounds; Beckett is 6-5, 305. 
</P>
<P>
 "We got a few complaints from them last year that there was never enough food 
at the pregame meal," Hartigan said. "They will really stretch our budget." 
</P>
<P>
 And, hopefully for Hartigan, a few defenses. The Eagles want to rely on the 
running game more this season because of Farris and Beckett, the Santa 
Margarita Mountains. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're going to ask Kris and Josh to move some people around this season," 
Hartigan said. "They certainly have the leverage." 10. MORE BULK 
</P>
<P>
 San Clemente's Brett Samperi may be the most sought-after lineman in the 
county. His 6-5, 270 frame has drawn recruiters like flies. 
</P>
<P>
 USC, UCLA, Washington and Nebraska are some of the schools drooling over him. 
11. SMALL FISH, BIG POND 
</P>
<P>
 OK, so Trabuco Hills won the Division VIII title last season. OK, so the 
Mustangs have won three championships and played in a fourth title game since 
1988. But is that any reason to punish them? 
</P>
<P>
 Trabuco Hills made the largest jump in Orange County history this year. When 
the Mustangs were moved into the South Coast League, they went from Division 
VIII to Division I. 
</P>
<P>
 "Even if we make the playoffs, the best we could hope for would be to draw a 
team like Long Beach Poly," Barnett said. "That scares me." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, Trabuco Hills is 5-1 against South Coast League teams over the last 
two seasons. 12. ON THE OTHER HAND . . . 
</P>
<P>
 Irvine won its third consecutive championship and was dropped to a lower 
division for the second time. Irvine won the Division II title in 1991, but was 
moved out of the South Coast League and into the Sea View League, which was 
Division IV. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, after Irvine has won back-to-back Division IV titles, the Sea View League 
has been dropped to Division V. 
</P>
<P>
 "Maybe that's our reward for all those years of being in the same league with 
Mission Viejo, Capo Valley and El Toro," Coach Terry Henigan said. 13. 
PRESSURE? WHAT PRESSURE? 
</P>
<P>
 By the way, don't remind Henigan that his team has won three consecutive 
titles. He doesn't want to hear it. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't say a word about those things around here," he said. "Every year we 
have a different group of kids. We don't want to compare seasons. There's 
enough pressure on them." 
</P>
<P>
 Sorry Terry, have to mention it. The Vaqueros could become the first Orange 
County team to win four consecutive titles. 
</P>
<P>
 Los Alamitos, which has won two championships and shared one, also could pull 
it off. 
</P>
<P>
 Brea-Olinda won three consecutive titles from 1961-63. 14. THE REAL DEAL 
</P>
<P>
 Russell Deal might help Irvine get that fourth ring. 
</P>
<P>
 The junior running back first went to Santa Margarita, where he was the MVP of 
a 10-0 freshman team. He transferred to Irvine last season and helped the 
Vaquero sophomore team go 10-0. 15. NO DUMMY 
</P>
<P>
 John Selbe has returned as Cypress football coach. He was the Centurions coach 
from 1985-92. 
</P>
<P>
 After eight years of banging his head against the wall, compiling a 24-43-2 
record, he stepped down to be an assistant. 
</P>
<P>
 Now he's back. Of course, the fact that Los Alamitos and Esperanza have left 
the Empire League -- and left it wide open -- probably had nothing to do with 
his return. 16. TRICK AND TREAT 
</P>
<P>
 On Oct. 31, 1993, Larry Montgomery turned 15. That was bad news for Troy 
opponents. 
</P>
<P>
 Montgomery was eligible to play varsity football from then on. He gained 120 
yards against Fullerton the following week. His next assignment was Sunny 
Hills. He gained 160 yards and scored two touchdowns. 
</P>
<P>
 Now Montgomery is a 6-foot-2, 185-pound junior. It's more bad news for Warrior 
opponents. 17. GONZO BUT NOT FORGOTTEN 
</P>
<P>
 Tony Gonzalez, Huntington Beach's all-everything linebacker/tight end, has had 
his No. 44 jersey retired by the school. Gonzalez is now at California. 18. 
GONZO AND PLEASE LET'S FORGET 
</P>
<P>
 Michael Graham -- remember him -- has finally landed. He's at Covina Charter 
Oak High School. 
</P>
<P>
 Graham, a junior running back, was so fast last year that he gained tons of 
yards at two schools, first Mater Dei, then Edison. 
</P>
<P>
 He finished with with 1,207 yards during the regular season. He also struck 
some pretty fancy Heisman Trophy poses during the playoffs, until he was struck 
by Los Alamitos in the quarterfinals. 19. SUPER SOPH 
</P>
<P>
 Esperanza quarterback Dave Parrish, one of this year's top sophomores, will 
have to wait his turn this season, backing up Chris Stretch. But he may see 
some time. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wouldn't be concerned about using him," Coach Gary Meek said. "He's got 
size and a great arm. The only thing I keep telling him is he lacks the 
athletic genes." 
</P>
<P>
 Parrish's father is Lance Parrish, former Angel catcher. 20. LET'S GET READY 
TO RUMBLE! 
</P>
<P>
 Orange County's 1994 Wrestlemania match -- Villa Park's Lenard Barnes (6-2, 
260) vs. Foothill's Tony Tuioti (6-1, 256). 
</P>
<P>
 These loose cannons meet on Oct. 13, when Villa Park plays Foothill at Tustin 
High School. The Century League title, not to mention the World Championship, 
should be on the line. 21. PAIN FREE 
</P>
<P>
 Everyone warned Ben Haley that if he took the job at Santiago, it would be 
nothing but headaches. 
</P>
<P>
 No parents. No money. No kids. No victories. Wrong. 
</P>
<P>
 Haley said the program has a booster club for the first time since 1979. 
They've even raised some cash, including $7,000 for video equipment. 
</P>
<P>
 Participation is up -- the varsity has 75 kids out compared to 32 at this time 
last year. The freshmen numbers are even better, 43 compared to eight last 
August. 
</P>
<P>
 There are no victories yet, at least not in games. But off the field . . .  
</P>
<P>
 "Everybody told me the attitude was the biggest thing I had to overcome here," 
Haley said. "That has been the easy thing. Everyone, the administration, the 
parents and the kids, have done what's needed." 22. A BRAVE NEW LEAGUE 
</P>
<P>
 One thing is certain, someone from the newly formed Golden West League is 
going to the playoffs. 
</P>
<P>
 Ocean View, Saddleback, Santa Ana, Servite, Tustin and Westminster -- the 
league's six teams -- failed to qualify last season. 23. THE THREE 
THOROUGHBREDS 
</P>
<P>
 Mater Dei certainly won't be lacking for weapons this season. The Monarchs 
return their entire starting backfield. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Quarterback John Flynn threw for 1,585 yards and 18 touchdowns. He is 15-3 
as a starter. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Tailback Steve Bodnar gained 1,111 yards and scored 10 touchdowns. When 
Graham left for greener pastures, the Monarchs' running game actually got 
better. Bodnar's wild 57-yard run against Long Beach Poly in the division 
quarterfinals helped the Monarchs pull out a 17-14 victory. 
</P>
<P>
 -- Fullback Joey Trampush may be the best of the three. He gained 697 yards, 
scored five touchdowns and tended to knock people down when they tried to 
tackle Bodnar. Trampush is also a good receiver. 
</P>
<P>
 Those three have a pretty hefty guy to do the blocking up front in Matt 
Motherway (6-3, 255), one of the top linemen in the county. 24. ONE HOSS 
</P>
<P>
 Santa Ana Valley, which hasn't qualified for the playoffs since 1979, will 
have to make do with only one returner in the backfield. Of course, that one 
guy is Dwayne Cherrington. 
</P>
<P>
 Cherrington gained 1,234 yards last season, including a 327-yard performance 
against Dana Hills. 
</P>
<P>
 Said Coach Scott Orloff: "When people chase Dwayne, he seems to run faster 
then they do." 
</P>
<P>
 'Nuff said. 25. GAME OF THE YEAR 
</P>
<P>
 No question about it -- Los Alamitos vs. Mater Dei, Friday, Dec. 9, in the 
Division I title game. TOP RETURNERS

</P>
<P>
 The Monarchs, as usual, don't lack talent. This season no one in the county 
has more. The backfield returns and sophomore wide receiver Rod Perry gives 
them a deep threat. The defense is inexperienced, but solid up front. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 2 - Los Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
 The Griffins, who have not lost in 35 games, drop all the way to No. 2. They 
lost a lot, but they found a lot, namely junior quarterback Kevin Feterik. The 
defense has holes, but the offense should be able to pull off plenty of 42-35 
victories. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 3 - Santa Margarita 
</P>
<P>
 The Eagles plan to grind it out this season and they have the offensive line 
to do it. If they can just find a running back to blow through those big holes, 
the Sea View League title should at last belong to them. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 4 - Esperanza 
</P>
<P>
 A perennial power loses little. Running back Dahrin Footman should be ready to 
have that long-awaited great season. Quarterback Chris Stretch is solid and, as 
always, there is size and strength on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 5 - Irvine 
</P>
<P>
 Yeah, the Vaqueros lost a lot. But they did last year too and still won the 
Division IV title. There is enough talent back, plus plenty of new blood from a 
10-0 sophomore team. Look for a slow start, followed by a fast finish. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 6 - Trabuco Hills 
</P>
<P>
 The Mustangs jump from Division VIII to Division I with a move to the South 
Coast League. They should be able to handle the new neighborhood. J.C. Pintsak 
and Chad Collins are both capable quarterbacks. The team has enough size and 
strength to be a factor in its new league. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 7 - Rancho Alamitos 
</P>
<P>
 The Vaqueros have so much talent they can move 1,000-yard rusher Kevin Allen 
from tailback to wide receiver. Chris Young, a transfer from Edison, will be 
the primary ball carrier. But with junior John Frank back at quarterback, Allen 
will see the ball plenty. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 8 - Sunset League's third-place team 
</P>
<P>
 Edison, Fountain Valley, Marina or Huntington Beach. Take your pick. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 9 - Villa Park 
</P>
<P>
 Gone is Grant Pearsall, Mr. Instant Offense, but plenty return. In fact, there 
are 14 returning starters. Quarterback Sean McMahon should step forward. The 
running game won't have a blazer like Pearsall, but it has quantity if not 
quality. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 10 - Kennedy 
</P>
<P>
 A move from the Garden Grove League to the Empire League will change nothing. 
The Fighting Irish are tough, especially with running back Charlie Marino back. 
If someone steps forward at quarterback, then a league title will follow. The 
Next 10 
</P>
<P>
 (alphabetically) 
</P>
<P>
 Anaheim -- Reuben Droughns left, Reuben Droughns right. 
</P>
<P>
 El Dorado -- Five returning starters on the offensive line. 
</P>
<P>
 Foothill -- Lots of size and a burner in Trammel Robinson. 
</P>
<P>
 Fullerton -- Loaded with 20 returning starters 
</P>
<P>
 Los Amigos -- Quarterback Ape Tuato is a load. 
</P>
<P>
 Mission Viejo -- Quarterback Austin Moherman could be great. 
</P>
<P>
 Servite -- Should dominate the new Golden West League. 
</P>
<P>
 Troy -- Someone has to win the Freeway League. 
</P>
<P>
 Valencia -- Always good, even in down years like this one. 
</P>
<P>
 Woodbridge -- Ian Dominelli is brutal on defense.

SEAY PERSEVERES, MAKES CHARGERS' STARTING LINEUP; FOOTBALL: HIS MOST RECENT 
PAST IS MARKED WITH TRAGEDY, HARDSHIPS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BERNIE WILSON, ASSOCIATED PRESS 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 In the cold, impersonal world of statistics, wide receiver Mark Seay has been 
a non-entity in two NFL seasons. 
</P>
<P>
 One game, no catches. 
</P>
<P>
 In reality, though, he's been going over the middle, making the tough plays, 
for the last six years. It's just that most of them weren't on the football 
field. 
</P>
<P>
 Perhaps the biggest play of his life came Oct. 30, 1988, when he was shot 
while shielding his 3-year-old niece from gang gunfire and lost a kidney. 
</P>
<P>
 Fast forward to Sunday night in Denver, when Seay will line up as one of two 
new starting wide receivers for the San Diego Chargers. 
</P>
<P>
 "I felt that something would break one day. I just didn't know when," Seay 
said. "I wasn't going to give up until something did. It wasn't easy. Believe 
me." 
</P>
<P>
 Seay persevered through the aftermath of that night six years ago when a .38 
caliber bullet smashed through his right kidney and lodged about four inches 
from his heart, where it remains. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay, the leading receiver at Long Beach State at the time, was sharing an 
apartment with his sister, and the family was having a Halloween party. 
</P>
<P>
 The shooting apparently was triggered by an innocent remark Seay's brother had 
made earlier in the day but which a gang member took offense to. 
</P>
<P>
 The gang came back, and one started firing through an open window. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay saw his niece, Tashawnda Roseborough, standing in the middle of the 
living room and hustled her to safety. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just went after her, not thinking I was going to get shot," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just reacted. Just like when you see a fumble, you don't look to see how 
big the guy is about to land on you after you cover up the ball. You just 
react." 
</P>
<P>
 But being a hero had a down side. 
</P>
<P>
 Long Beach State, fearing liability problems, told Seay he couldn't play 
anymore. Seay sued to get his rights back, eventually agreeing to sign a 
liability waiver as part of an out-of-court settlement. 
</P>
<P>
 "That took a lot out of me," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So did other events -- the death of Long Beach State Coach George Allen, not 
being drafted despite leading Long Beach State in receptions as a junior and 
senior, and being waived after spending the 1992 season on the San Francisco 
49ers' practice squad. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay had grown close to Allen, who came out of retirement to coach Long Beach 
State in 1990, the year Seay returned. 
</P>
<P>
 When Long Beach State beat Pacific, 28-7, for Allen's first victory after 
three losses, the former NFL coach declined the game ball, handing it to Seay. 
</P>
<P>
 "He's inspired me," said Allen, himself considered a master of motivation. 
</P>
<P>
 Allen, 72, died three months later. 
</P>
<P>
 "That killed me," Seay said. "Once I came to know him as a person as well as a 
coach, I could understand why players did play for him the way they did." 
</P>
<P>
 All those setbacks "just made me more determined and more hungry, and then 
once I did get an opportunity, I wasn't going to let it get away from me," Seay 
said. 
</P>
<P>
 The Chargers liked Seay in college, General Manager Bobby Beathard said. But 
when he was available as a free agent, team doctors had flunked him on a 
physical exam because of the shooting. 
</P>
<P>
 When the 49ers waived Seay in August, 1993, the Chargers signed him. This time 
he passed the physical. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay was on San Diego's 53-man roster all last season but was activated only 
once. Since a May mini-camp, Seay has worked his way up from No. 3 on the depth 
chart to earn the starting spot opposite Shawn Jefferson. 
</P>
<P>
 Seay, 27, said he rebounded from the shooting by turning a negative situation 
into a positive one. 
</P>
<P>
 "I probably wouldn't have the willpower that I have now, if those things 
wouldn't have occurred," he said. "I think I found something out about myself 
that I didn't know even existed. A lot of people don't even know what they have 
in themselves until something tragic happens or their life gets thrown off 
track. 
</P>
<P>
 "Some come back, some don't. And I'm glad that I know myself enough to know 
what I can and can't overcome. And I believe I can overcome anything that I put 
my mind to." 
</P>
<P>
 Which is why Seay is not worried about his lack of experience. 
</P>
<P>
 "All I have to do is think about where I came from. Think about how hard it 
was to get to this point, and remember how badly it felt when you couldn't 
play, no matter what the situation was."

MAJOR CHANGES IN THE MINORS; WOLFF HAD EXPERIENCE BEATING THE BUSHES; BASEBALL: 
HE FORMULATED INDEPENDENT IDEA AFTER OWNING THE DURHAM BULLS. 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By STEVE ELLING, TIMES STAFF WRITER

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Miles Wolff did it first. 
</P>
<P>
 Can others do it better? Some are spending millions to find out. 
</P>
<P>
 Four years ago, Wolff began putting together the nation's first independent 
minor league. There were plenty of teams without major-league affiliations 
dotting the baseball landscape, but none played exclusively in a league of 
their own. 
</P>
<P>
 Last summer, Wolff's six-team Northern League kicked off its inaugural season 
with flying colors. Attendance was high, the caliber of play solid. 
</P>
<P>
 Folks were paying attention. 
</P>
<P>
 By this time next year, nine independent leagues could be in operation, 
including the proposed Valley-based Golden State League, which hopes to 
establish a franchise in the Antelope Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Each of the independent leagues will attempt to duplicate Wolff's heady 
success in the short-season Northern League, which includes teams in Canada, 
Minnesota, South Dakota and Iowa. Like a prairie fire, the independents are 
spreading in all directions. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent teams have no affiliation with big league clubs, the operational 
lifeline for most minor-league teams. Big league teams supply equipment, 
coaching and player salaries, an investment of $500,000 a year at the Class-A 
level, one farm director said. Rosters are filled with players selected in the 
annual June amateur draft. 
</P>
<P>
 Independents sign their own players and pay their own operational costs. Teams 
are composed of a potpourri of free agents, minor-league castoffs and washed-up 
big leaguers. By most accounts, the independent brand is roughly comparable to 
Class-A ball, minus a few frills. 
</P>
<P>
 It's unique. It's risky. Yet Wolff and others seem to have created quite a 
niche, judging by the volume of knockoffs on the market. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northern League fast became such a handful that Wolff was forced to retool 
his job description. Formerly publisher of Baseball America magazine, Wolff 
stepped aside last year and assumed the role as president of Baseball America, 
Inc. 
</P>
<P>
 "The league was taking up too much of my time," Wolff said. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolff has a considerable background in conventional minor-league ball, yet in 
a manner of speaking, he now prefers the independent brand. Teams with 
major-league affiliations come with plenty of strings. 
</P>
<P>
 For instance, on affiliated teams, high-profile prospects are rarely with a 
club long enough to establish an identity within their host community. They 
routinely move up to the next level, often around playoff time. 
</P>
<P>
 What's more, affiliated minor league teams don't always put their best team on 
the field. Bonus babies play to justify the parent club's contractual 
investment. All in the name of player development. 
</P>
<P>
 "Farm-system baseball has lots of problems," Wolff said. "With the players, if 
they're good, they're gone. Players are there only to move up." 
</P>
<P>
 Of course, the finances of minor league franchises with big league operating 
agreements are inextricably tied to the parent team. Minor league owners must 
stomach the demands of the big league clubs, which foot much of the operational 
bill. 
</P>
<P>
 Major league teams provide the coaching, players, equipment. . . . In short, 
as Wolff says minor league teams know only too well, the tail does not wag the 
dog. 
</P>
<P>
 "If you own a McDonald's franchise and they tell you to sell horse meat," 
Wolff said, "then you don't have much choice." 
</P>
<P>
 Wolff owned the Durham Bulls, a Class-A affiliate of the Atlanta Braves, for 
11 years before he sold the club three years ago. The Bulls, featured in the 
movie "Bull Durham," are perhaps the most famous minor league team. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolff started thinking about forming an independent league in 1990, when he 
was involved in negotiations to hammer out the Professional Baseball Agreement, 
which helped establish operational guidelines and standards for minor league 
clubs. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolff called the negotiations with representatives of big league clubs 
"acrimonious," and said he didn't particularly relish the company he'd been 
keeping at the bargaining table. 
</P>
<P>
 "I wasn't sure I wanted to be associated with them anymore," he said. 
</P>
<P>
 So he went solo. 
</P>
<P>
 Wolff first considered setting up an independent league in New England. There 
were plenty of available stadiums and the area is densely populated. 
</P>
<P>
 However, Wolff soon noticed a pattern: He was receiving dozens of phone calls 
from fans and city officials in the Northern Midwest. They all wanted to know 
how they could land minor league teams for their hometowns. 
</P>
<P>
 He took his first trip to the region four years ago and started the political 
ball rolling. Only one stadium needed to be erected, in Sioux City, Iowa. The 
Northern League also has teams in Duluth and St. Paul, Minn.; Sioux Falls, 
S.D.; Thunder Bay, Ontario; and Winnipeg, Manitoba. 
</P>
<P>
 A crucial thread runs through the league, he said, and undoubtedly has 
contributed to its success. Northern League franchise owners all had 
backgrounds in minor league ball and several had experience running 
independents. 
</P>
<P>
 Northern League rosters are filled with players released by teams with big 
league affiliations, a plan that will be mirrored by the other independent 
leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 The Northern League boosted its profile -- and its attendance -- by signing 
former major leaguers such as Leon Durham, Pedro Guerrero and Dennis (Oil Can) 
Boyd. 
</P>
<P>
 Players have used the league as a springboard to opportunity. In 1993, 37 
players in the Northern League either participated in spring training the 
following year or had their contracts purchased by big league organizations. 
</P>
<P>
 Attendance in last summer's 72-game season averaged 3,300 per game. The 
Northern has experienced a 22% increase this season and last week officials 
announced the league had broken the short-season record. 
</P>
<P>
 More than ever, Wolff is convinced that independent baseball can work, but 
with one proviso: Organizers and team owners must know the business beforehand. 
Otherwise, they might stigmatize all independent leagues. 
</P>
<P>
 "You hope they do it right," Wolff said. "My fear is that someone (starting a 
new league) won't know what they're doing. 
</P>
<P>
 "They'll kill baseball in all of these little towns. They'll poison the 
water." 
</P>
<P>
 RELATED STORY: C13 INDEPENDENTS DAY 
</P>
<P>
 TODAY 
</P>
<P>
 Miles Wolff, who formerly published Baseball America magazine, last summer 
founded the first independent league -- the highly successful Northern League. 
Attendance boomed and others took notice. Next summer, as many as nine 
independent leagues could be in operation. SUN. 
</P>
<P>
 Independent leagues serve as a last chance for career minor leaguers and major 
league castoffs. One of the top hitters for the Sioux Falls (S.D.) Canaries of 
the Northern League is former Dodger Pedro Guerrero. Life at this rung in 
professional baseball is often unpredictable and humbling. Players are actually 
traded for bats and balls.

PRO BASEBALL / JEFF FLETCHER; CARDINALS HANGING ON TO A GOOD CATCH 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By JEFF FLETCHER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 If you've noticed that catcher Mike Borzello's statistics haven't changed much 
this season, that's because he hasn't played much. 
</P>
<P>
 Borzello, who played at Taft High and Cal Lutheran, had only four at-bats at 
Class-A Savannah, Ga., before he was moved to Class-A Madison, Wis., where he 
has seven at-bats in two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
 Why, you ask, does he even bother? 
</P>
<P>
 "(The Cardinals) asked me about (coaching) last year," Borzello said. "I knew 
I had a limited role as a player, so I thought that would be fine." 
</P>
<P>
 Borzello spent the first part of the season in Savannah, where he was among 
four catchers. He was moved to Madison to replace an injured player, and he 
became the third catcher there. All this after he played in only 13 games last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just work with the other catchers and try and help with the pitching 
staff," he said. "I throw batting practice once in a while, whatever they need 
me to do." 
</P>
<P>
 Mike Jorgensen, Cardinal director of player development, said he is happy with 
the job Borzello has done. 
</P>
<P>
 "Mike is a guy that we like in the organization," he said. "He's been able to 
go to a few different ballclubs where he's been a third catcher. We don't 
consider him a prospect but we like him as an organizational guy." 
</P>
<P>
 Borzello, 24, said he would eventually like to move into full-time coaching, 
but he's not sure when that will be. 
</P>
<P>
 "I haven't really thought about it," he said. "I just show up every day and do 
whatever they tell me to do." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Moved again: For the second year in a row, Dmitri Young, a former top draft 
pick from Rio Mesa High, finished his season at a different position. Young, 
who had trouble at third base and first base, was moved in midseason to the 
outfield, where the St. Louis Cardinals intend to keep him. 
</P>
<P>
 "He did a good job in the outfield and we were pleasantly surprised," 
Jorgensen said. "He enjoys the position and he's gotten to where he feels 
comfortable. We played him at first and third, and the way we look at it right 
now, (outfield) is his best position. We are definitely going to leave him 
there for now." 
</P>
<P>
 Young, 20, recently completed his first full season at double-A Arkansas, 
hitting .272 with eight home runs and 52 runs batted in. He also made 16 
errors, but most were at first or third base. With Young settled in the 
outfield, the Cardinals' main concern is his weight. 
</P>
<P>
 "We have him concentrating strictly on an off-season conditioning and weight 
program," Jorgensen said. "We want him to lose 20 pounds." 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Injury update: Former Monroe right-hander Joel Zamudio is on his way to 
Instructional League later this month. 
</P>
<P>
 Zamudio, a ninth-round pick of the Philadelphia Phillies in June, was injured 
and sent home before he even made an appearance this summer at rookie-level 
Martinsville, Va. 
</P>
<P>
 "My first day pitching I was throwing (in the) bullpen," Zamudio said, "and I 
don't know what happened. It just came. My arm got hurt." 
</P>
<P>
 Zamudio returned home, where he has been running and lifting weights. He said 
his arm feels fine, but the Phillies didn't want him to pitch until he returned 
to Instructional League in the fall. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Short hops: Former Mission College pitcher Osvaldo Fernandez has a streak of 
29 2/3 innings without allowing an earned run for Class-A Riverside. Fernandez, 
the California League pitcher of the week last week, has given up just four 
runs during the stretch. 
</P>
<P>
 Fernandez defected from Cuba and pitched one game at Mission last spring 
before the Seattle Mariners selected him in the 22nd round in June. He is 7-2 
with a 3.13 ERA. . . . 
</P>
<P>
 With his team's bullpen depleted by three extra-inning games in the previous 
four nights, former Cal State Northridge standout Scott Richardson, an 
outfielder, was forced to pitch last Friday for Class-A Stockton. 
</P>
<P>
 Richardson got only one out in the 14th inning, giving up three runs and 
taking the 8-5 defeat to Central Valley. 
</P>
<P>
 Things were so bad in Stockton that 41-year-old pitching coach Mark Littell, 
who pitched briefly in the major leagues in the early 1980s, was activated and 
pitched on Saturday night. He won.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; NO. 1-RANKED BISHOP AMAT ISN'T ALL TALK RADIO 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By VINCE KOWALICK, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Talk may be cheap, but the Bishop Amat High football team might be worth the 
heap of hype that's going around. And not just around the league, around the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
 One national poll ranked Bishop Amat as the top high school football team in 
the nation. Another ranked the Lancers best in the state. "Amat," as the 
parochial power is known, is even the topic of conversation on the radio dial. 
</P>
<P>
 "I was driving home one night, listening to XTRA Sports, and they were talking 
about Bishop Amat," Alemany Coach Pat Degnan said. "I'm thinking: 'This 
(broadcast) is going nationwide and they're talking about a high school team. 
And we're in this league.' " 
</P>
<P>
 On paper, anyway. Truth is, Bishop Amat, a perennial Division I power, is in a 
league of its own. 
</P>
<P>
 The Lancers, who reached the quarterfinals last season, have 14 returning 
starters -- nine of them on defense -- and 50 returning letterman suited up for 
summer practice. Several players remain from the 1992 team that was 14-0 and 
crushed Sylmar, 31-10, in the first-ever postseason matchup between City and 
Southern section champions. 
</P>
<P>
 No doubt about it: Bishop Amat is a hands-down choice to win the Del Rey 
League, if not the division championship. 
</P>
<P>
 It's almost enough to make an opposing coach throw up his hands and surrender. 
</P>
<P>
 "We just hope we'll be able to make a first down," St. Paul Coach Marijon 
Ancich cracked. "We got a press guide from them and I thought we were playing 
LSU." 
</P>
<P>
 So, how do you prepare for prep football's pinnacle team? By pooh-poohing all 
the lofty preseason prognostication. At least, you try. 
</P>
<P>
 "Everyone says that preseason rankings don't mean a whole lot and that's the 
same thing we say," said Crespi Coach Tim Lins, whose team likely will have a 
tough time finishing third. "Our kids are not intimidated." 
</P>
<P>
 Added Loyola Coach Steve Grady: "We know that they have great players. But 
we'll play them tooth and nail."

 It will be difficult. This season's team is among Bishop Amat's best ever, 
featuring "a mature and seasoned senior class," first-year Coach Tom Salter 
said. Senior tailback Daylon McCutcheon, son of former Ram running back 
Lawrence McCutcheon, is a preseason All-American. So is fullback Kory Minor. 
Both are returning starters, although McCutcheon moves from wide receiver, 
where he caught 35 passes last season. 
</P>
<P>
 "We're in pretty good shape, no question," said Salter, a varsity assistant 
and lower-level coach at Bishop Amat since 1985. "The kids here are not 
bothered by all the publicity." 
</P>
<P>
 Grady recalls highly regarded Loyola teams from the past that were good, but 
fell short of exceedingly high preseason expectations. Del Rey League coaches 
can only hope a similar fate is in store for Bishop Amat. 
</P>
<P>
 "Our team keeps it in perspective," Grady said. "Really, how can anybody be 
the No. 1 team in the nation?" 
</P>
<P>
 Well, that's what they say.

 The Montreal Impact scored early in the second half and recorded a 1-0 victory 
over the Salsa in a American Professional Soccer League game Friday before 
3,672 in Claude-Robillard Centre. 
</P>
<P>
 The victory moves the Impact into a second-place tie with the Salsa.Each club

 Lloyd Barker scored for Montreal 10 minutes into the second half. The sequence 
started with Jean Harbor firing a shot. Barker controlled the rebound and 
scored. 
</P>
<P>
 The Salsa had a chance to score about five minutes later when Paulinho had a 
penalty kick. But his shot hit the side post and bounced away.

TITAN FORWARD LITTLE DISMISSED FROM SCHOOL 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LON EUBANKS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Darren Little, a 6-7 forward who started 20 games last year for the Cal State 
Fullerton basketball team, has failed to meet the university's academic 
standards and has been dismissed from school. 
</P>
<P>
 Coach Brad Holland confirmed Friday that Little will be lost for his senior 
season because his grade-point average for the past academic year fell below 
university standards and he was not readmitted for the fall semester. 
</P>
<P>
 Little was the team's third leading scorer last season as a junior, averaging 
11.7 points. "Darren certainly was a potential starter for us this year," 
Holland said. "But we wish him well, and hope he goes back to school somewhere, 
and eventually can play one more year." 
</P>
<P>
 Little, who played in high school at Quitman, Ga., and at Palomar College in 
San Marcos, also was third on the team in rebounding. He shot 42.1% from the 
field and 56.1% on free throws. 
</P>
<P>
 This marks the second consecutive year that the Titans have lost a potential 
starter because of academic problems. Guard Don Leary also was declared 
ineligible last fall.

 Whether the proposed Golden State League becomes the Foldin' State League 
isn't really the point when it comes to independent baseball. 
</P>
<P>
 Even if the Valley-based Golden State never gets off the ground, others are 
planning to take wing, for better or worse. Independent minor league ball has 
quickly become a rage as it establishes footholds across North America. 
</P>
<P>
 The Golden State, organized by investment banker Bob Weinstein of Chatsworth, 
is one of nine leagues that could be in place by next summer, according to 
published reports. 
</P>
<P>
 The highly successful Northern League has become the bellwether for those who 
choose to meander down the independent path. Early reports, judging by turnout, 
indicate that fans like what they see. 
</P>
<P>
 Consequently, organizers of independent leagues believe the demand hasn't been 
satiated and have anted up to prove the point. 
</P>
<P>
 Golden State research indicates that the number of minor league teams fell 
from more than 400 in 1950 to 99 in 1993. Independents plan to fill the 
long-standing void. 
</P>
<P>
 In addition to the Golden State, leagues that reportedly are playing or in the 
organizational stages are: 
</P>
<P>
 * The Western League (spanning Washington state, Canada and California) is 
expected to begin play in 1995. The league plans to field eight teams in two 
divisions. 
</P>
<P>
 The north division will have teams located in Washington and British Columbia 
while the south will have franchises in Palm Springs, Long Beach, Salinas and 
Rohnert Park. 
</P>
<P>
 The league president is Bruce Engel, a former franchise owner in the Northern 
League. Al Campanis, formerly of the Dodgers, will serve as the Palm Springs 
general manager. 
</P>
<P>
 * The North Central League, with six teams located in the U.S. and Canada, 
opened play in June. 
</P>
<P>
 How's this for a logistics nightmare: A 17-hour bus ride is required to cover 
the distance between league franchises located in Minneapolis and Saskatoon, 
Saskatchewan. 
</P>
<P>
 The Minneapolis entry is coached by former major leaguers Greg Olson and Juan 
Berenguer. 
</P>
<P>
 * The eight-team Texas-Louisiana League opened its 88-game schedule in May. 
Managers include former major league notables Pete Falcone, Charley Kerfeld, 
Alan Ashby and Jose Cruz. 
</P>
<P>
 * The eight-team Frontier League began play last summer with clubs scattered 
across Ohio, Pennsylvania, Kentucky and West Virginia. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Great Central League, with teams in four cities spanning the American 
Heartland, began a 72-game schedule in June. Managers include ex-big leaguers 
George (Boomer) Scott, Paul Blair and Cleon Jones. 
</P>
<P>
 * The four-team Northeast Baseball League, based in New York State, opened its 
45-game season July 1. 
</P>
<P>
 * The Mid-South League, with seven teams in Mississippi, Louisiana and 
Alabama, is expected to open play next summer.

HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL PREVIEW; ANTELOPE VALLEY IS TEAM TO BEAT 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MICHAEL LAZARUS, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Golden League schools should be forgiven if they enter the 1994 football 
season with chip on their shoulder. 
</P>
<P>
 Since 1989, the league competed in the Division I playoffs, the highest 
classification in the Southern Section. But last spring, it was dropped to 
Division II, after only one team, Antelope Valley, advanced past the opening 
round. 
</P>
<P>
 The switch has left Antelope Valley Coach Brent Newcomb and other league 
coaches with a touch of anger as the season opens. 
</P>
<P>
 "I can see a couple of reasons why they might have done it but that doesn't 
mean I agree with it," Newcomb said. "For three years, kids from our league 
have been respectable in the playoffs and they've been ready to shoot for the 
highest title." 
</P>
<P>
 Despite the drop in divisions, the Golden League might be stronger than in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Quartz Hill returns six starters on both offense and defense from the team 
that compiled the first undefeated regular season in school history. 
</P>
<P>
 Ridgecrest Burroughs has its top player, tailback DeMario Brown, returning and 
the Burros appear ready to claim their first playoff berth since 1979. 
</P>
<P>
 Palmdale and Littlerock have considerably more depth than a year ago, and 
Highland, after a 1-8-1 season, changed it's offense to showcase quarterback 
Jason Carr. 
</P>
<P>
 But no team appears to have as much talent as Antelope Valley. Tailback 
Jermaine Lewis, punter/lineman Chad Shrout, defensive lineman Caleb Smith and 
quarterback/defensive back Trymon Redick are enough to convince most league 
coaches to favor the Antelopes. 
</P>
<P>
 How much do league opponents respect Lewis, a junior who gained 1,612 yards 
and scored 19 touchdowns last season? At least two teams will start tailbacks 
similar in stature to the 5-7, 155-pound Lewis. 
</P>
<P>
 Littlerock will start junior Lafayette Bailey (5-9, 170). Bailey doesn't have 
much experience at tailback (93 yards in 20 carries), but returned a kickoff 95 
yards for a touchdown against Quartz Hill last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Antwane Marcy (5-8, 150), a transfer from Edison High in Fresno, will be the 
Lewis-clone for Highland in the Bulldogs' one-back attack. 
</P>
<P>
 "Every team wishes they had somebody like Jermaine," Highland Coach Lin Parker 
said. "We hope we have something close." 
</P>
<P>
 But Lewis isn't the only player coaches are raving about. Shrout is considered 
one of the best punting prospects in the nation and Smith was an all-league 
selection last year. 
</P>
<P>
 Even with the standout players, the Antelopes nearly missed the playoffs in 
1993. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope Valley finished the regular season 10-1, losing only to Quartz Hill, 
but an ineligible, second-string player played in four games. 
</P>
<P>
 The administrative error was discovered just before the playoffs started. The 
Antelopes' league record dropped to 1-4, denying them a berth in the 
postseason. But after a vote of league officials, Antelope Valley was 
reinstated two days before the opening round. 
</P>
<P>
 The Antelopes made the most of the opportunity, reaching the Division I 
semifinals before losing to Mater Dei. Included in the run was a 21-7 upset of 
Bishop Amat, ranked No. 1 in the state. 
</P>
<P>
 Antelope players would have liked another shot at Bishop Amat or Mater Dei but 
will have to settle for a chance at the Division II title. "I've thought about 
it a lot since we first found out about Division II," Smith said. "It would 
have been nice to get another shot at Bishop Amat, but it's not going to 
happen. We don't worry about it as much now. People are going to expect us to 
win."

CAL STATE NORTHRIDGE SOCCER PREVIEW; MATADORS LIKE THEIR OPTIONS 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By MIKE HISERMAN, TIMES STAFF WRITER 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Ross Linhart hasn't scored a goal in two seasons playing for Cal State 
Northridge, yet no person is more qualified to lend an opinion about the 
Matador soccer team's offensive prowess. 
</P>
<P>
 Linhart, the club's top defender, faces the very best Northridge has to offer 
during each and every practice -- and he likes what he sees. 
</P>
<P>
 "I've marked forwards from all over the country," Linhart said, "and we have 
some of the best." 
</P>
<P>
 Linhart names Mathew Davis, Keith West, Keith Rosenberg and Nelson Townes. 
Which of them, he is asked, might be Northridge's new go-to guy, replacing 
All-American Armando Valdivia, who has exhausted his eligibility? 
</P>
<P>
 There is a notable pause. "Since there are no superstars, there's going to be 
a few of those guys," Linhart said. 
</P>
<P>
 Most likely, it will take more than one player to replace Valdivia's 
productivity. Last season he led the Matadors with 17 goals and 20 assists. 
</P>
<P>
 Northridge opens the post-Valdivia era tonight at 7 with a nonconference match 
against Cal State Dominguez Hills at North Campus Stadium. 
</P>
<P>
 And who might the Matadors look for in a close game? 
</P>
<P>
 Marwan Ass'ad said it might be anyone. And, for now at least, he prefers it 
that way. 
</P>
<P>
 "We don't design plays for people," said Ass'ad, who has guided Northridge to 
11 consecutive winning seasons. "We play soccer. We don't want to get (the 
ball) to just one or two guys. Who's open, he gets it." 
</P>
<P>
 Davis, who had 10 goals and two assists last season, and West, who scored 
eight goals with two assists, are the top returning scorers. 
</P>
<P>
 Rosenberg, who Linhart said, "has wings on his feet," was Northridge's most 
heavily recruited player. The junior from Irvine Valley College might miss 
tonight's opener while his junior college transcripts are being processed, but 
he is expected to join the lineup by Monday, when the Matadors play host to 
Gonzaga at 6 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
 Along with Linhart, Davis and West, goalie Mark Macdonald and midfielders 
Mustapha Sesay and Iain Doleman are returning starters. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors last season finished 12-9 overall and 5-2 in the Mountain Pacific 
Sports Federation. Northridge knocked off Air Force in the first round of the 
conference's postseason tournament before losing to UCLA in the final. 
</P>
<P>
 Air Force was selected for an at-large berth in the NCAA playoffs and advanced 
to the Division I quarterfinals. Cal State Fullerton, another MPSF team that 
Northridge defeated, went to the Final Four. 
</P>
<P>
 The Matadors, meanwhile, were denied a playoff invitation. 
</P>
<P>
 Defeats to unheralded San Diego State and San Jose State, plus losses to Cal 
Lutheran and UC San Diego, a pair of NCAA Division III teams, apparently 
thwarted Northridge's chances. 
</P>
<P>
 "They weren't good teams, nobody gave them any respect, and we lost to them," 
West said. 
</P>
<P>
 Bitten by injuries throughout last season, Ass'ad has beefed up Northridge's 
roster to a point where he says the Matadors could withstand injuries to two 
forwards, two defenders and three midfielders. 
</P>
<P>
 Foremost among newcomers are Rosenberg, Townes, forward Dominic Zapata, 
defenders Garrett Torres and Brandt Marott and midfielder Anthony Carillo. 
</P>
<P>
 "This year, our second 11 is just as good as our front 11," Linhart said. 
"Everyone is strong and we're all pushing each other to get better."

POP BEAT: DOWNSET: A PERSONAL TAKE ON PUNK-RAP 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By LORRAINE ALI, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
</P>
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 Social and political awareness has long fueled some of the best and most 
intense rock, especially in the genres of rap and punk. L.A.'s Downset draws 
from both areas, making it a sort of urban hard-core band, and delivers a 
strong mix of music and message on its recent major-label debut, "Downset." 
</P>
<P>
 While the material lead rap 'n' railer Rey Oropeza chooses to base his lyrics 
around -- from racism to sexism to general social disorder -- may not be 
entirely new, his personal and passionate take on it is.  
</P>
<P>
 "Events in my life and my anger toward the system motivates me to do what I 
do," says Oropeza, 22, who grew up in a tough part of San Fernando and took his 
musical cues from early hard-core bands such as Black Flag and rappers 
Grandmaster Flash. 
</P>
<P>
 Originally, punk was a reflection of white, middle-class kids' need to rebel 
against the Establishment -- which is exactly what bands like the Dead Kennedys 
and Bad Religion did. Rap aired black, urban frustration, pioneered by such 
artists as Public Enemy and Ice Cube. 
</P>
<P>
 Now, bands such as Downset and Rage Against the Machine -- whose major-label 
debut in 1992 became a national best-seller -- represent a merger of the 
styles. But where Rage's Zach de la Rocha tends to focus outwardly -- on such 
national issues as the fate of jailed Native American Leonard Peltier -- 
Oropeza's lyrics are shaded more by his own experiences. 
</P>
<P>
 "The way I grew up influences my lyrics 100%," says Oropeza. "I was a 
pissed-off kid who didn't want to end up like everyone else in the neighborhood 
and in the family. Literally your whole world starts to crumble around you, so 
you try to grab on to anything you can before you die along with it. So I just 
hung on to what I could which is my expression -- graffiti art and music." 
</P>
<P>
 On the new Mercury release, an enraged Oropeza roars about some of the 
Latino-black gang violence he witnessed while growing up. 
</P>
<P>
 I was taught to hate you / And you were taught to hate me. / America better 
check itself / Before it wrecks itself , he roars in "American Dream." 
</P>
<P>
 Oropeza, who was in his first band when he was 13, was weaned on hard-core and 
rap, but didn't feel totally satisfied by either sound. 
</P>
<P>
 "A lot of punk music coming out in the early '80s was just a bunch of suburban 
kids hating the cops and spraying anarchy signs," he says. "That got kinda 
boring after a while. 
</P>
<P>
 "In rap, there's a continual amount of expression about the ills of the 
neighborhood -- the barrio -- but they just keep saying them over and over 
again. 
</P>
<P>
 "I realize the need to vent, but if you're gonna bring an ill to the table, 
sooner or later you gotta start talking about solutions."  
</P>
<P>
 The danger in making socially or politically charged records is coming off too 
preachy and turning off listeners. So far, Downset -- which will play at the 
Palace on Wednesday at the opening of the annual Foundations Forum rock 
convention with the Mighty Mighty Bosstones and other bands -- avoids that 
problem by creating music as powerful as the lyrics. But you get the feeling 
that Oropeza isn't worried about appeasing anyone. 
</P>
<P>
 "I just have to do what I do, and if people get it, that's even better."

 The Wildcats have experienced hard times recently, failing to qualify for the 
Southern Section playoffs the last two seasons after four consecutive 
appearances. If Brea-Olinda is to revert to winning form, Looney needs several 
of his veteran players to have standout seasons. Fortunately for Looney, the 
Wildcats are deep in experience. Eleven players have earned varsity letters the 
last two seasons, and five have been two-year starters. SCHEDULE

 Had it not been for a tough Whittier defense, the Southern Section Division VI 
title game would have been a showcase for the league. Western lost to eventual 
runner-up Whittier, 24-12, in the semifinals. That loss, however, did not 
diminish a season replete with success. Western is again a serious league title 
contender. Although the Pioneers are strong and talented, there are many 
questions about the offense. Howell must find a triggerman, following the 
graduation of standout quarterback Brandon Brennan. Chambers might get the 
call. Although inexperienced, he possesses the skills needed to lead. 
Defensively, Howell has less to worry about. Starkey was a first-team 
all-league selection last season and is eager to run into the opposition. Bell 
can kick with the county's best. SCHEDULE

 Magnolia football fans have not had much to celebrate during this decade. The 
Sentinels are 3-26-1 since 1991, including 2-12-1 in league play. Although 
Friedrich isn't making plans to celebrate a league championship, he believes 
the program is making strides. If nothing else, the Sentinels should be 
physically stronger than last season because many players worked hard during 
the off-season, Friedrich said. Rios (6 feet 1, 270 pounds) is expected to 
anchor the offensive line. SCHEDULE

 Di Palma presided over a remarkable turnaround, leading Savanna to the 
Southern Section Division VI championship after the Rebels were 3-6-1 in 1992. 
What's more, the title run followed a third-place finish in league play. The 
Rebels might not win another section title this season, but they have the 
strength and speed--lots of speed--needed to keep fans cheering. Several jobs 
are open on the offensive and defensive lines, but the talent is there. 
Although Paul Waldrop, who led Orange County quarterbacks in passing efficiency 
during the regular season, has graduated, Di Palma believes he has a competent 
replacement in Klemp. Waldrop's backup last season, Klemp will work with 
several quality receivers. King and Flores provide a skilled backfield. Di 
Palma is excited about the potential of Warden, the starting signal-caller for 
the JV team in 1993. SCHEDULE

 Most coaches would experience at least a few sleepless nights following the 
graduation of a talent such as Stanford freshman Chris Draft--The Times 1993 
Orange County back of the year. But not Marrujo, who has made a career of 
keeping the Tigers' football machine at full strength by developing the right 
replacement parts. "Chris was great, but he's gone now and you just have to 
move on," Marrujo said. "We've had a lot of good players leave before and we've 
always managed to be pretty competitive." Don't count on any changes this 
season. Marrujo has enough talent to win his 11th league title in 14 seasons, 
and the Tigers should again compete with Savanna and Western for the top spot. 
Marrujo expects the defense to be among the league's best--and with good 
reason. Gray, first-team all-league as a sophomore and junior, dominates at 
defensive back. And he's faster and stronger this season. Reilly, first-team 
all-league last season, is fierce against the run. SCHEDULE

 Carter, an Anaheim assistant for three seasons, takes over after the two-year 
reign of Todd Borowski, who twice guided the Colonists to the Southern Section 
Division VI playoffs. Carter played tailback at USC from 1971-75; you can 
probably guess his offensive preference. And thanks to Reuben Droughns, Anaheim 
might have the top rushing offense in Orange County. As a sophomore, Droughns 
gained 2,039 yards and scored 18 touchdowns, and was chosen Cal-Hi Sports 
sophomore player of the year. Anaheim's success, however, is not contingent on 
Droughns' legs alone. Carter expects the Colonists' defense to win some games, 
too. Reuben's brothers, Robert Droughns and Nowden, are integral parts of the 
defense. SCHEDULE

 "Vigil at the Crossroads," a performance piece scheduled for 4 to 7 p.m. 
Friday in the Sycamore Hills area of Laguna Canyon Road, will protest the San 
Joaquin Hills toll road project, for which part of the canyon has been 
bulldozed by the Transportation Corridor Agency. One hundred white crosses will 
be placed alongside the road by participants dressed in black to symbolize, 
according to a press release, false assumptions that have permitted the agency 
to "metaphorically bulldoze through local and federal protective legislation." 
An open casket bearing an American flag also will be part of the piece, 
questioning "whether a democratic process can prevail in Orange County." (714) 
497-9126.

JAZZ REVIEW ; GREMOLI MARCHES ON IN TRUE NEW ORLEANS STYLE 
</P>
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
<P>
By BILL KOHLHAASE, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES

<P>
 During Gremoli's performance of the New Orleans traditional jazz number "Lead 
Me Savior" at the Fullerton Hofbrau on Thursday, the beer hall-and-restaurant 
jukebox kicked in and a grunge-rock beat began blaring through the speakers. 
But the five-piece group never missed a beat as the decidedly more aggressive 
and amplified rhythm briefly overshadowed the combo's own sounds. 
</P>
<P>
 The jukebox was quickly disabled, and Gremoli kept on wailing, brushing off 
that bit of intrusion as if it never existed. The bass and banjo pulsed. The 
clarinet soared. The cornet chuckled. And the trombone slid through a series of 
guffaws. 
</P>
<P>
 The incident served as a tidy image of longevity. The type of music Gremoli 
plays -- traditional New Orleans sounds in the style of the Crescent City's 
Preservation Hall Jazz Band -- has seen musical fads come and go. But it just 
keeps marching along. 
</P>
<P>
 The audience for New Orleans music may not be as big as those for grunge or 
rap, but it has stood by the genre for a period that's measured in decades 
rather than months. 
</P>
<P>
 And new interest seems to be building, as young aficionados search for the 
roots of rock 'n' roll, and clubs such as the Derby and Atlas Bar & Grill in 
Los Angeles offer retro-sounds that hark back to the '30s, the '20s and beyond. 
It seems like everyone, as in the line from "The Saints Go Marching In," now 
wants to be in that number. 
</P>
<P>
 But it's important to note that Gremoli is no Dixieland band. The group, which 
leader-clarinetist Ron Going estimates has some 200 songs in addition to the 
obvious standards, plays in the New Orleans marching-band and dance-hall 
tradition, a style heavy with improvisation and less commercial than its more 
familiar, southern counterpart. 
</P>
<P>
 * 
</P>
<P>
 Thursday's show (Gremoli has an indefinite Thursday run in progress at the 
Hofbrau) featured such obscure numbers as Sam Morgan's "Bogalusa Strut," Ma 
Rainey's "Jelly Bean Blues" and a George Lewis tune, "Underneath Hawaiian 
Skies," which had disappeared for some 40 years until it was rediscovered in 
1991 on an obscure, private-label 78 found in someone's attic. 
</P>
<P>
 Between sets, Going explains how the the band (Gremoli is an anagram of 
Gilmore, the surname of the group's original cornet player) is constantly 
unearthing new material in what he calls the "true folk music of New Orleans." 
</P>
<P>
 Together since 1989, the band consists of Going, cornetist Ted Thomas (who 
replaced founding member Denis Gilmore), banjo player Vic Loring, bassist Mike 
Fay and trombonist Jim Leigh. Occasionally, the ensemble is joined by drummer 
Bert Thomas, a Northern California resident. 
</P>
<P>
 Going takes a moment between numbers to spin anecdotes about the material to 
follow or explain its origins. Before leading the group into "Hiawatha Rag," he 
tells how a group of New Orleans musicians assembled in the 1940s to record the 
piece looked at the music and said, "We always called it 'Lizard on a Rail.' " 
</P>
<P>
 That tune, a mid-tempo piece with a pulse like a heartbeat, held almost 
polka-like passages that featured a clean blend of horns. Trombonist Leigh took 
a vocal turn on the ballad "Breeze" after cornetist Thomas cried his way 
through a suitably melancholy solo. 
</P>
<P>
 The group's ensemble play is in the true New Orleans style with each horn 
leading and playing off the others as a theme progresses. The tight framework 
is provided by Loring's sharp banjo beat in unison with Fay's string bass, 
which makes for a pulse as regular as a sleeper's breath. 
</P>
<P>
 Gremoli has a self-produced CD, "Hot, Tight and Ready," that gives a good 
overview of its style, and it makes appearances around the state at jazz club 
gatherings and trad-jazz festivals. In the Orange County area, the group 
frequently appears at the Capistrano Depot in San Juan Capistrano and is 
featured this weekend at the Los Angeles Classic Jazz Festival.
